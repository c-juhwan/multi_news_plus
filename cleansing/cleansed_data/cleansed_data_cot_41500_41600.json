Designed by netherlands-based office for metropolitan architecture and germany's buro ole scheeren, the building is more than 1.8 million square feet, spread across eight hectares. The word building is used rather loosely, however. The apartment complex actually includes 1,040 apartment units in 31 six-story blocks, stacked at odd angles so that each apartment includes views of the lush green surroundings, reports business insider. There are also open courtyards, plus rooftop terraces and gardens. A rep says the idea was to create a village rather than a standard apartment complex. \" there's multiple opportunities for social connectivity, a real sense of community, the presence of nature, and generous space, \" he says, per cnn. Though the interlace won the top award in the housing category, as well as the title of best building overall, there were many other winners in 34 categories, per architectural digest. Among them: the fulton center in new york city. It took home the top award in the transport category, partly due to its 110-foot-tall glass oculus and \" sky reflector-net, \" which sends dappled light onto 300,000 daily commuters.

So report northwestern university researchers in the journal of forensic sciences after interviewing and evaluating 153 murderers for more than 1,500 hours. Domestic homicide is one of the most common types of murder in the us, with one-third of all murdered american women killed at the hands of their male partners, current or former. Among the things these killers have in common? severe mental illness — especially psychotic disorders — along with few previous felony convictions, lower intelligence, low emotional and impulse control, and greater cognitive impairment. \" these murders are in the heat of passion and generally involve drugs or alcohol and often are driven by jealousy or revenge following a separation or a split, \" lead researcher robert hanlon says. \" this is grabbing the kitchen knife out of the drawer in a fit of anger and stabbing her 42 times. \" in fact, guns are the murder weapon in only 14 % of these cases; knives, bats, hammers, clubs, rocks, and fists were other weapons used by the men interviewed, reports the chicago tribune. \" these crimes are often preventable if family members are more informed about the potential danger from having someone who is severely mentally ill in the home and who may have shown violent tendencies in the past, \" hanlon adds. \" the fact is the husband or son may very well harm the wife or mother. \" ( the man who recently murdered six kids and their parents in houston was an estranged boyfriend. )",

A study in the journal of allergy and clinical immunology suggests that children breastfed by peanut-eating moms are less likely to develop a nut allergy later, reports the telegraph. But the other factor in providing protection is to directly give peanuts to the kids in their first year of life, per the study. Researcher meghan azad of children's hospital research institute of manitoba dug into the breastfeeding angle after studies began to suggest that early introduction of peanuts helped, reports the cbc. But though \" peanut proteins actually make their way into breast milk, \" azad found no published research on peanuts and breastfeeding. She did, however, find a 1995 study that tracked 342 kids from birth to age 7 when they were tested for a peanut allergy, which included data on mothers ' peanut consumption during breastfeeding. Of those kids, 60 were breastfed by moms who snacked on peanuts and were given peanuts in their first year, and only one of them ended up with an allergy later. \" so it's under 2 %, whereas in the other categories, it was up around 15 or 16 %, \" she says. \" it seemed to be really that the combination was important. \" azad is still working to understand the benefits but says antibodies and immune factors in breast milk \" could be interacting with the peanut proteins to induce tolerance. \" ( could there be a peanut allergy cure? )",

        "summary": "Doctors in florida are now free to ask patients about guns in their home despite protests from the national rifle association. A federal appeals court struck down a provision of the so-called \" docs vs. Glocks \" law barring doctors from asking patients about gun ownership unless the information is medically relevant in a 10-1 decision thursday, noting it violates a doctor's right to free speech. The provision was included in 2011's firearm owners ' privacy act after a few incidents: in one, a couple complained their doctor refused to see them because they wouldn't discuss guns, per the miami herald. The washington post puts some doctors ' position thusly: that it's \" within the bounds of ethical medical care for doctors to ask about gun safety at home, in the way a physician might ask parents of small children if they have a backyard pool. \" the court found thursday \" there was no evidence whatsoever \" that doctors \" infringed on patients'second amendment rights. \" indeed, the law meant doctors could face penalties simply by \" adequately performing their professional obligation, \" read the majority opinion, per wjxt. Florida's aclu branch says \" the court has finally put to bed the nonsensical and dangerous idea that a doctor speaking with a patient about gun safety somehow threatens the right to own a gun, \" per reuters, though the issue could still be brought in front of the supreme court. With thursday's decision, doctors will still be barred from discriminating against patients because they own guns. As always, patients can also refuse to answer questions from doctors.",

            "Tallahassee, fla. - siding with a coalition of individual doctors and medical groups, a federal appeals court ruled thursday that major portions of a controversial florida law restricting physicians and other health-care providers from asking patients about guns is unconstitutional. The statute, dubbed the \" docs vs. Glocks \" law, included a series of restrictions on doctors and health providers. For example, it sought to prevent physicians from entering information about gun ownership into medical records if the physicians know the information is not \" relevant \" to patients ' medical care or safety or to the safety of other people. Also, the 2011 law said doctors should refrain from asking about gun ownership by patients or family members unless the doctors believe in \" good faith \" that the information is relevant to medical care or safety. And the law sought to prevent doctors from discriminating against patients or \" harassing \" them because of owning firearms. The plaintiffs in the case, including individual doctors, argued that the restrictions were a violation of their first amendment rights. A federal district judge agreed with them and blocked the law from going into effect. A three-judge panel of the 11th u.s. Circuit court of appeals upheld the constitutionality of the law in three separate rulings, but the ban keeping the law from going into effect remained in place. Thursday's 90-page decision --- comprised of two majority opinions authored by different judges, as well as a dissent --- came from the full appellate court after the plaintiffs requested what is known as an \" en banc \" review.

The washington post reports it was a surprise 49-51 defeat for a resolution that would have repealed a bureau of land management rule curbing methane emissions, with republicans john mccain, lindsey graham, and susan collins joining democrats in voting against it. Mccain was a last-minute \" no, \" depriving vice president pence the opportunity to cast the tie-breaking vote, according to the hill. The rule prohibits companies drilling on federal land from burning off excess natural gas and releasing methane into the atmosphere, npr reports. It was the first time under trump the senate failed to repeal an obama-era rule using the congressional review act — something it has done 13 times already. The cra allows congress to overturn rules that were enacted within 60 legislative workdays. But mccain expressed concern in this case that using the cra would prevent the possibility of similar regulations in the future. That echoes a similar sentiment from graham. While environmentalists celebrate the win, energy industry officials are now planning an effort to rewrite the rule, which federal estimates say prevents 180,000 tons of methane a year from entering the atmosphere but which the energy industry says makes drilling on federal land overly expensive. Thursday is the final day to use the cra to overturn obama-era rules.",

That's why the seattle dad of three has been hard at work fundraising, with one goal in mind: to pay down the school lunch debt of every student in the state of washington. Today.com reports that lew first became aware of the \" school lunch shaming \" issue — in which kids who owe money on their lunch accounts either get stuck with a cold lunch instead of a hot one, or don't get a lunch at all — after he read a \" devastating \" story online about it. \" it boggles my mind that a child can accrue a debt at school, \" he says, noting he decided to take action. First he took care of the nearly $ 100 communal debt at his own son's school; then he started a gofundme to raise money to take care of the $ 20,000 owed throughout the seattle public schools district. Lew raised more than $ 50,000 and took his efforts further, paying off more than $ 100,000 in five school districts across the state. He also co-founded lunchdebt.org and started a new gofundme to wipe out the entire state's lunch debt, with a more ambitious goal of $ 650,000. Lew says he wants \" universal lunches \" in schools, noting how inmates are guaranteed three squares a day, but not kids. \" these are innocent little children [ who ] should only worry about studying and doing their best, not worrying if they will go hungry, \" he tells today.com. Lew's efforts are also resonating with the younger set in neighboring states: khq reports on 6-year-old amiah van hill, an idahoan inspired by lew's work who started a lemonade stand to help pay the debt in coeur d ' alene schools. \" it makes me feel happy, \" amiah says of the nearly $ 1,500 she's raised so far.

For that price, an anonymous bidder has become the owner of a poem signed by anne frank on march 28, 1942, reports the bbc; her family was forced into hiding in amsterdam on july 6 of that year. The poem was initially sent to the older sister of one of anne's friends, jacqueline van maarsen. However, van maarsen says her sister, who died in 2006, gave it to her around 1970. According to the auction website, van maarsen decided to sell the poem because \" i know that my sister was not as attached to this verse. \" indeed, she found it to have a \" condescending tone, \" in the words of the new york times. \" my sister didn't really like the poem very much because anne was very critical of her, because she left school early, whereas anne was busy all the time, \" van maarsen says. The first four lines of the poem — instructing christiane van maarsen to \" once again take up your task \" in times of failure \" and try harder than before \" — were copied from a magazine, but the last four lines may be of anne's own creation. They read in part, \" if others have reproached you … then be sure to amend your mistake, \" per cnn, which has a complete translation. The poem was expected to fetch as much as $ 52,000, but bubb kuyper's owner notes that while \" in itself its historical significance is fairly limited... There is not much material out there anymore in terms of anne frank memorabilia, \" per the telegraph. ( anne frank's marbles were found in 2014. )",

The 22-year-old, who is believed to have been in a coma for more than a year, was rushed to the university of cincinnati medical center for urgent treatment after he arrived on a us military flight. A us official confirmed to fox that warmbier is a coma, but said he was unable to confirm pyongyang's claim that he contracted botulism and took a sleeping pill before falling into a coma after his march 2016 trial, in which he was sentenced to 15 years ' hard labor for stealing a propaganda banner. The latest: parents cindy and fred boarded the plane when it landed, the washington post reports. A few minutes later, warmbier was carried out on a stretcher by medical personnel. He had a shaved head and a tube in his nose. Well-wishers outside the airport fence held \" welcome home otto \" signs. In warmbier's hometown of wyoming, just outside cincinnati, residents say they are happy he is free and they are doing their best to support his family. \" everybody feels a sense of relief that he is coming back to the united states, \" resident amy mayer tells the ap. \" i think we're very excited yet very prayerful about what is happening because we've heard he is in a coma. \" a doctor with the cincinnati health department tells wlwt that it is very unlikely that botulism or sleeping pills caused the coma. \" this is not consistent with what botulism causes in terms of symptoms. It may cause paralysis, but a coma means that you are no longer conscious, \" dr. Steve englander says. Department of state spokeswoman heather nauert says warmbier's release has nothing to do with dennis rodman's latest trip to north korea, cbs news reports. Ohio's sen. Rob portman released a statement condemning warmbier's sentence as \" unnecessary and appalling. \" \" north korea should be universally condemned for its abhorrent behavior, \" he said. Former ambassador and new mexico governor bill richardson said he had spoken with warmbier's parents, who were only informed of his condition a week ago. \" we received a call from cindy and fred warmbier early today to update us on otto's condition, \" he said in a statement, per afp. \" in no uncertain terms, north korea must explain the causes of his coma. \" white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders says warmbier's release was \" a big priority \" for president trump and he worked \" very",

        "summary": "The extent of destruction is still unknown after scores of tornadoes ripped through the midwest yesterday, killing at least six people and decimating entire neighborhoods in the hardest-hit towns in illinois. The national weather service says the tornadoes were spawned by an unusually strong and fast-moving storm system that moved east this morning after hitting 12 midwestern states. A look at the latest: the illinois national guard has sent firefighters to the town of washington, where a tornado ripped a path about an eighth of a mile wide from one side of town to the other, the ap reports. Whole blocks were destroyed and dozens of people were injured in the town of 16,000, which lies about 140 miles south of chicago. It's not clear just how many tornadoes were involved in the destruction, which lasted around five hours. The national weather service has reports of 81 tornadoes, mostly in illinois, but some may have been counted twice. Hundreds of thousands have been left without power in states including illinois, indiana, ohio, and michigan, reports cnn. The american red cross has set up emergency shelters for thousands of people made homeless by the storms, and teams have begun the search for people who may be trapped in debris. A possible tornado hit a uranium enrichment plant in paducah, ky., damaging one building, reports the ap. But a spokesman said that there no was no sign of \" radiological or hazardous material releases. \" the late-season severe weather was caused by winter jet streams hitting unusually warm air, experts say. \" you've got wintertime winds in the atmosphere above summertime moisture, \" a national weather service meteorologist tells the chicago tribune. \" while unusual, when that happens, you're going to have very strong storms that move very quickly. \" amid the destruction, neighbors are helping neighbors, the new york times finds. A central illinois man says his niece and her family were at church when a tornado completely destroyed their farm, tossing their trucks around like toys. But soon after the storm passed, neighbors arrived to help the family find their belongings in the ruins. \" you get that in the heartland for sure, \" he says. \" there were probably 100 people there to help — it was just amazing. \" click for the ap's state-by-state breakdown of damage.",

When the blue jackets hired tortorella last october after an 0-7 start under coach todd richards, he already had committed to coaching team usa in this year's world cup. The scheduling conflict he has long feared is now upon him, and it's the professional equivalent of having one child getting married and the other having a baby. The world cup will take place in toronto from sept. 17 to oct. 1, meaning tortorella will miss the first 10 days of blue jackets training camp and four of the club's eight exhibition games if the u.s.

In columbus, ohio, ahead of the tournament this week, with nhl players representing their country, the kaepernick question has been a common one. Many of the players who have gone on record have looked to avoid controversy. Some who addressed kaepernick's decision talked their way around the issue while expressing their own respect for the flag and the anthem. The u.s.

        "summary": "On the heels of a child abuse scandal, the bbc finds itself embroiled in another controversy — this time over covert reporting in north korea. The london school of economics says the media organization \" deliberately misled \" and endangered 10 of its students during a trip to the country that included a trio of undercover reporters. The leading university wants the bbc to cancel the resulting documentary, set to air today, and offer an apology. But the bbc says students were informed multiple times that there would be a journalist among them, while the program is firmly in the public interest and won't be canceled. \" the only people we deceived \" were those in \" the north korean government, \" said the bbc's news chief, who noted that students were informed of risks including \" arrest, detention, and the possibility of not being allowed back into the country. \" still, the bbc later clarified that the details of the documentary hadn't been revealed to students for their own safety, in case of questioning, the new york times reports. The students ranged in age from 21 to 28, the bbc reports, and their identities will be hidden in the documentary using techniques like pixelation, the guardian adds. Meanwhile, dennis rodman, whose previous visit to the country was tied to an hbo documentary, says he's headed back, the miami herald reports.",

In a series of tweets, trump complained about the ninth circuit federal court, which previously froze his travel ban. \" does everyone notice that both the ' ban ' case and now the'sanctuary ' case is brought in the ninth circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned ( close to 80 % ), \" he wrote. ( he's right on the latter stat, per politifact. ) both rulings are \" ridiculous, \" he wrote, adding, \" see you in the supreme court! \" on tuesday, judge william orrick issued a temporary freeze on trump's executive order. Orrick doesn't sit on the ninth circuit court but on the northern district of california court. That's within the ninth's jurisdiction, however, and any appeals would end up in the ninth, notes politico. In his ruling, the judge cited the words of the president and his aides in suggesting that the idea of the white house withholding money from cities that don't enforce his immigration polices is unconstitutional, notes the washington post. He noted that in an interview with bill o'reilly, trump referred to the penalty as a \" weapon, \" while spokesman sean spicer stated that \" counties and other institutions that remain sanctuary cities don't get federal government funding. \" attorney general jeff sessions made similar comments. Justice department lawyers argued that cities wouldn't be greatly affected and that the order was merely an enforcement of current law, but orrick wrote, \"if there was doubt about the scope of the order, the president and attorney general have erased it with their public comments, \" per the new york times. Only congress, not the president, can make such decisions about federal funding, he wrote.",

Lopez obrador's statement thursday came less than an hour after trump asserted in a tweet that mexico was paying for the border wall through the savings the u.s. Garnered in the renegotiated free trade agreement with mexico and canada. The two leaders spoke by phone wednesday about immigration and lopez obrador's push for a marshall plan-like effort to spur economic development in central america. Lopez obrador said the conversation was respectful and friendly, but did not discuss the border",
            "President trump pledged thursday to do \"whatever it takes to get border security, \" deepening an impasse over border wall funding barely a week from a crucial deadline for a partial government shutdown to begin. In a video posted on twitter, trump attacked democrats as \"absolute hypocrites \" and claimed they've supported funding border barriers in the past but won't do so now because of their opposition to him. The video showed images of people rushing the border and included clips of senate minority leader charles e. Schumer ( d-n.y. ), former secretary of state hillary clinton and former president barack obama speaking in opposition to illegal immigration and in favor of border security. \"we need to have the wall. We need border security. Whatever it takes to get border security,"

        "summary": "Since the mid-1950s, humans have produced more than 6 billion tons of plastic — and at least in hawaii, geologists are finding that some of it is now fusing to volcanic rocks, seashells, sand, and coral to form an entirely new type of rock. Calling them plastiglomerates, the geologists say they found the stones at all 21 sites they surveyed on the big island — the new york times reports the rocks ranged from as small as a peach pit to as large as a large pizza — and that they've been identified on another hawaiian island as well. The prevailing theory is that the plastiglomerates form when people burn plastic in beach bonfires or campfires; the heat helps fuse the organic and inorganic materials, according to science. Some of the plastic is still close enough to its original shape to resemble the toothbrushes, forks, and ropes they once were. Some of the rocks are likely making their way down to the bottoms of sea beds, where they are more likely to be preserved in the geological record. As one marine biologist tells the times, \" most conventional plastic is relatively thin and fragments quickly, but what's being described here is something that's going to be even more resistant to the aging process. \" that has one geophysicist not involved in the study suggesting there's a sort of silver lining to this: the rocks \" might be a nice marker around the world of when humans came to dominate the globe and leave behind their refuse in mass quantities, \" he says. As such, one paleontologist argues the plastiglomerates could \" be one of the key markers by which people could recognize the beginning of the anthropocene \" — a new geologic era on earth marked by human's heavy impact on the planet.

Judge dana christensen, siding with wildlife groups against trump administration policies, said the ruling was \" not about the ethics of hunting, \" but about whether threats to the species ' long-term survival had been considered when protections were lifted last year, the bbc reports. It would be \" simplistic at best and disingenuous at worst \" for federal authorities not to consider how removing protection would affect grizzly bears in other areas where populations have been recovering, christensen wrote. Alliance for the wild rockies director michael garrity tells the billings gazette that the bears'situation is comparable to an isolated town of 700 people where people become inbred after a few generations. \" the same thing is happening to yellowstone grizzlies, \" he says. \" they can't be recovered until their population is reconnected to the grizzly bear population around glacier park and the bob marshall wilderness area. \" wyoming gov. Matt mead was among the officials who reacted with disappointment, the ap reports. \" grizzly bear recovery should be viewed as a conservation success story, \" he said, arguing that the ruling shows why congress should make changes to the endangered species act.",

It's not the first time nagasu has skated for america, but the 24-year-old's past attempts haven't been so headline-grabbing. She ended up fourth in vancouver in 2010 and missed out on sochi in 2014. The washington post reports her dream of landing the jump was what brought her back to the ice after that sochi \" snub. \" espn echos that series of events, and reports it took nagasu two years to master the jump, which she attempts about 30 times a day in training. Writing for usa today, christine brennan sees the jump as making her a contender for an individual medal ( that competition starts feb. 21 ), though she notes bets are on russian skaters alina zagitova ( \" the sport's new 15-year-old ' it ' girl \" ) and evgenia medvedeva taking gold and silver. Slate reports that ito and asada both ended up with silver after their own triple axels. As for the team competition, canada took gold and olympic athletes from russia took silver. The post notes only one other american woman has landed a triple axel in competition: tonya harding did so at the 1991 world championships.

Joel cervantes macias says he spotted sanchez struggling to push his cart in the little village neighborhood on thursday. It turns out sanchez and his wife retired two months ago, but sanchez was forced back to work when their daughter died last month. She was \" like a mother to us, \" he tells dnainfo. Cervantes snapped a photo of the man and gave him a $ 20 tip on his purchase, reports the chicago tribune. But back at home, he couldn't forget him. Instead, he created a gofundme page to raise $ 3,000 for sanchez. He reached that goal in an hour. The tally sits at more than $ 250,000 as of tuesday. \" it broke my heart seeing this man who should be enjoying retirement still working at this age, \" cervantes wrote. He adds: \" if it touches me, i should've known it touches everybody else who sees him. \" he credits the photo he took of sanchez — who makes about $ 50 a day selling ice pops, per nbc chicago — for inspiring some 11,000 people to donate. \" he looks like he's suffering, like he ' ll never give up, \" cervantes says.

The paper apologised in print today and online yesterday for the error, which the author of the piece, mark williams-thomas, insisted had been introduced at the paper despite being told it was wrong. Williams-thomas, a former policeman who now works as a criminologist, subsequently explained: \" at 19.48 hours on tuesday 9th march i sent amended copy to the interviewing journalist at the daily mail in which i had made small but significant changes to the copy she had sent to me which i read at 19.21, including removing the word facebook and replacing it with ' well known social networking site '. I made it very clear to the journalist and her alone that the changes i had made were necessary before publication. It is clear that the changes were not made...

The show tuesday night drew 18.2 million viewers, many of them in the coveted 18-49 age bracket, figures that have stunned hollywood, reports deadline. Maybe not surprisingly, the numbers also drew the attention of president trump himself, who placed a call to roseanne barr wednesday to express his admiration for the ratings coup on abc, reports the new york times. Barr is a staunch supporter of trump in real life, as is her character in the show, roseanne connor. During the call, the president reportedly reminisced about a time they met a while back, per axios. In terms of the ratings, the show did especially well in states where trump the candidate did well — the top three cities being tulsa, oklahoma; cincinnati, ohio; and kansas city, missouri. Deadline notes that the only big city from a blue state in the top 10 was chicago at no. 5. The show drew a strong 5.2 rating in the 18-49 range, the best performance of any broadcast tv sitcom since the big bang theory hit 5.5 in 2014, notes the washington post. Two other standout numbers: it grabbed 10 % more viewers than tuned in for its 1997 finale, and is no. 2 for the season in terms of total viewership, behind the post-super bowl episode of this is us. One sentiment as a result is that voiced by piers morgan, who wrote, \" a message there, methinks, for all the screaming trump-hating liberals: not everyone in america thinks like you... \" the reboot has eight more episodes to go, but this makes season two a \" foregone conclusion, \" notes the hollywood reporter.

While nostalgia was expected to bring in eyeballs, no one predicted such a huge turnout on premiere night for the blue-collar family sitcom with a donald trump-supporting protagonist, especially among the younger demographic. But then, few predicted that trump would become the republican nominee and would win the presidential election when he first announced his candidacy. Carsey-werner both trump and roseanne were able to tap into the often overlooked and underserved working-class audience, especially the portion that holds mostly conservative views. Not surprisingly, the top tv markets where roseanne delivered its highest ratings were in states handily carried by trump in the election. No. 1 was tulsa in oklahoma, which trump won with 65.3 % of the vote. It was followed by cincinnati, ohio and kansas city, missouri. The only marquee city from a blue state in the top 10 was chicago at no. 5 — the area where the series is set. Abc focused some of its marketing efforts in the region with a preview of the revival at the 54th chicago international film festival. The top market of the country, new york, was not in the top 20; no.2 los angeles was not in the top 30. And yet, roseanne delivered the highest demo rating for any comedy telecast in 3 1/2 years, since the fall 2014 season premiere of tv's biggest comedy series of the past five years, the big bang theory. There no doubt was an element of nostalgia and curiosity about how the characters from the original series have changed and about the new generation of the conners. But roseanne went beyond that. Its youngest 18-49 viewers when the series originally aired on abc from 1988-97 are now at the very top or outside of that ad-friendly demographic range, in which last night's premiere posted a staggering 5.2 live+same day rating with no lead-in. It came largely from new viewers who were children or not even born during roseanne's initial run. Somehow roseanne transcended age, recruiting droves of young viewers for a show whose two leads, roseanne barr and john goodman, are both 65, well outside of the 18-49 demo.

Anita hill's accusation of sexual harassment almost cost thomas his supreme court confirmation, which was 25 years ago this week, the post notes. His supporters described smith's accusations as a politically motivated attack. Through a spokeswoman, thomas told the journal: \" this claim is preposterous and it never happened. \"",

As vox reports, \" the basic method here entails taking animal stem cells, nurturing them in a growth medium, and then slowly transferring them as they grow into industrial-size bioreactors. \" the researchers say a typical bioreactor could produce \" 56,438 pounds of meat per year, \" or enough to feed some 2,560 people — though national geographic notes that figure is predicated on consumption of about an ounce per human per day; americans consume about 10 times that. One problem: that \" growth medium, \" which would probably be some sort of blood derived from bovine fetuses, would prove not only controversial but pricey; it's estimated at around $ 946 a gallon, and a big driver in the ultimate pricetag of lab-produced meat.

        "summary": "The looming government shutdown has had one tangible effect so far: president trump has put plans for a trip to his florida mar-a-lago resort on hold, reports nbc news. \" the president will not be going to florida until the cr passes, \" the white house said, referring to a continuing resolution to keep the government open before a midnight deadline arrives. However, the likelihood of a deal shrank even more on friday when trump and sen. Chuck schumer failed to strike an agreement at an afternoon white house meeting, reports usa today. Trump had been planning to leave friday to attend an anniversary bash on saturday at mar-a-lago, a celebration of his first year in office, reports bloomberg. More on the shutdown, and its potential effects on everyday life: prospects: things are \" dicey at best \" in terms of a deal, with politico seeing a \" seemingly intractable impasse \" in the senate. One huge sticking point is that democrats want any spending plan to include protections for about 700,000 young \" dreamer \" immigrants. Still, talks were continuing, and it's possible the senate could take some kind of action friday to avoid the shutdown, if only for the short term. The effects: you ' ll still get mail if the government shuts down, and social security recipients will still get their checks. Air traffic controllers and the tsa would stay on the job, so air travel shouldn't be greatly affected, explains usa today. But services deemed \" non-essential \" would suffer — for example, those waiting on a passport might be out of luck. The ap has a video primer.",

And it worked well. \" as shults handled communications, ellisor, a 44-year-old former air force pilot, flew the plane to an altitude with richer oxygen.

Shults then took over the controls for an emergency landing at philadelphia international airport, a process that was sped up ( they traded a planned long-approach landing for a short one ) as the pilots learned of injured passengers, including jennifer riordan, who'd later die after being partially sucked out of the broken window, reports the new york times. \" we just took the knowledge that we had \" and \" pooled it, \" says a modest shults.

Authorities say syed muzaffar hit the girl, her brother, and her mother while they crossed at a crosswalk in san francisco, the chronicle reports. A lawsuit filed early this year pointed to distracted driving on muzaffar's part, saying he was waiting for a ride request on uber's app. The company, which was also named in the suit, says muzaffar wasn't dealing with a fare at the moment of the crash and shouldn't have been looking at his phone. Driving an suv, muzaffar was turning right at a green light when the crash occurred, officials say. He has been charged with misdemeanor, rather than felony, manslaughter because prosecutors didn't see evidence of gross negligence — such as driving under the influence, the chronicle notes. The charges are the latest in a string of problems for uber, which was banned by judges in spain and thailand today amid concerns over the authorization of drivers, the local and al jazeera america report. This weekend, a new york times op-ed attacked the company's data-collection policies; it's currently facing a lawsuit from the city of portland, oregon; and it's been banned in delhi after a driver allegedly raped a passenger.",

Without ado: president obama: citing \" a brilliant writer, a fierce friend, and a truly phenomenal woman, \" obama noted that his own sister is named for the poet, who \" above all, was a storyteller — and her greatest stories were true. The voice she found helped generations of americans find their rainbow amidst the clouds, and inspired the rest of us to be our best selves. \" president clinton: \" america has lost a national treasure; and hillary and i, a beloved friend. I will always be grateful. The poems and stories she wrote and read to us in her commanding voice were gifts of wisdom and wit, courage and grace. \" oprah winfrey: \" i've been blessed to have maya angelou as my mentor, mother/sister, and friend since my twenties. She was there for me always, guiding me through some of the most important years of my life. The world knows her as a poet but at the heart of her, she was a teacher. ' when you learn, teach. When you get, give, ' is one of my best lessons from her. She moved through the world with unshakeable calm, confidence and a fierce grace. I loved her and i know she loved me. I will profoundly miss her. She will always be the rainbow in my clouds. \" over at slate, dee lockett reminds us that \" angelou's talents extended well beyond the written and spoken word. \" in the ' 50s, angelou was an aspiring singer and dancer who eventually recorded an album, miss calypso, which in turn inspired her first film, calypso heat wave. At salon, laura miller lauds angelou as \" the voice of america, \" a poet who even had a line of hallmark cards for which she was mocked, \" but the public adored her and found in her words both wisdom and comfort. Angelou's is a style that lends itself well to the realm of social media, with its informal habit of sharing and passing along quotations and mottos. \"",

I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness, \" the revered poet and activist, maya angelou, who died wednesday at age 86, once described her relationship with songwriting. As the former u.s. Poet laureate and the author of a classic memoir, she ' ll likely be remembered most for her writing, but angelou's talents extended well beyond the written and spoken word. In fact, in the early 1950s — a decade before her first published writing — angelou started out as an aspiring dancer and singer who slowly gained a following from her performances in local san francisco nightclubs. And in 1957, at the height of the calypso movement — a style popularized by harry belafonte — angelou recorded her first and only album, miss calypso. In it, she covers nat king cole's \"calypso blues \" and louis jordan's \"run joe, \" using her deep vibrato to create a simmering fusion of jazz and afro-caribbean rhythms. The album even partly inspired her first feature film, calypso heat wave, in which she both starred and sang. Though short-lived, angelou's music career also included songwriting credits for the legendary b.b. King on two tracks he recorded for the quincy jones-produced soundtrack to sidney poitier's for love of ivy.

Rajan says the company would have likely had to lay off some of the managers if they hadn't left voluntarily.

According to the times, many employees were excited to have more freedom within the company, but even zappos ' head of public relations acknowledged the change was \" weird. \" the post reports some of the innovations being floated under the new management structure include a zappos airline and zappos-branded porta-potties. \"while we have lost a number of folks, it is important to note that we have a significant group of highly talented individuals who will be staying to help move zappos forward, \" the times quotes a statement from rajan.

Police say adam and emily harteau and their daughters, 6-year-old colette and 3-year-old sierra, were passengers on a ferry from the amazon gateway city of belem to macapa that was attacked by pirates on sunday, abc reports. Police say the pirates held the crew and passengers hostage for hours and there was no sign of the family after they left. The harteaus were rescued wednesday by a villager who spotted them floating on a piece of driftwood in the river, police say. They were unharmed apart from scratches and insect bites. It's not clear how the family escaped the pirates, though emily harteau's father, warren brandle, tells the wall street journal that he has seen a report that they jumped out of a boat with their surfboards and rode currents to safety. He adds that such an escape wouldn't surprise him because his son-in-law is a \" build-a-fire-out-of-sticks kind of guy. \" the couple, who documented their travels on the \" our open road \" blog, left california in 2012 intending to spend a year traveling south america in their volkswagen van, but ended up making it a much longer journey. Adam harteau's brother, keith harteau, tells the ap that the family was planning to move back to california later this month so the girls could grow up close to relatives and \" have a little bit of foundation. \" ( river pirates killed a british traveler in the same amazon region in september. )",

            "Comic book fans can argue over which superhero is the coolest. The noble superman or the snarky iron man? the dark knight of despair or the red-white-and-blue captain america? and they will argue because, well, that's what comic-book fans do. That's part of the fun. But in a summer which has already seen a couple of those characters come back in new adventures — and some other would-be blockbusters go bust — here's something that's hard to debate: \" the wolverine \" is the best superhero film since \" the avengers \" — maybe even since \" the dark knight. \" to be honest, low expectations do help. The last \" wolverine \" solo film — the 2009 how-it-began picture \" origins \" — didn't thrill too many fans. And if the original franchise hadn't been losing its mutant power, the studio wouldn't have rebooted things with the recent \" x-men: first class. \" but fans of the sharp-knuckled fellow always knew that he had a lot of potential, and that one day he'd get the vehicle to show it off.

Two experiments conducted as part of a study published in december 2015 show that guys who look briefly at an image of an attractive woman fare better in memory tests than men who gaze at more \" average \" faces, pacific standard reports. \" the fact that highly attractive members of the opposite sex can make people lose all their mental faculties is nearly a comedic cliché, \" write the researchers in evolutionary psychology. \" yet, demonstrating desirable mental traits, such as a robust memory, would be helpful for attracting a mate. \" in the first experiment, 58 psychology students heard a story while glimpsing 10 opposite-sex faces for seven seconds each; half saw faces rated as highly attractive ( 6.16 on a 7-point scale ) or average ( 2.55 on that same scale ). Quizzed after, men who saw pretty faces better recalled the story, while women's memory was hardly affected. The next test split 123 students into groups that saw images before and after hearing the same story — with one group seeing attractive faces before and average after, one vice versa, and one seeing only average ones. Again, those who saw attractive faces first fared better, though this was less true among women. The pictures \" are likely to have primed a short-term mating goal, \" the researchers say. The studies seem to conflict with earlier research showing that men's cognitive performance declines when socializing — or even thinking about socializing — with a woman, reported pacific standard in 2012. But as lead researcher michael baker points out, glancing at an image is far less stressful than actually socializing. Or as new york puts it, \" ha-ha, men.

Almost 60 people were arrested, including nascar driver/owner derek white, who turned himself in wednesday after hearing about a warrant out for his arrest. Canadian officials, assisted by the us dea and homeland security, started investigating illegal transports of tobacco from north carolina to canada in 2014. The alleged scheme, which the montreal gazette reports has links to biker gangs and aboriginal organized crime, involved buying tobacco in the us and bringing it into canada without declaring it, thus avoiding taxes. Police say that since 2014, at least 2,294 tons of tobacco were transported, meaning about $ 530 million in canadian taxes went unpaid. Profits from the tobacco sales were allegedly used to buy cocaine, and more than 1,800 pounds of cocaine was seized in the raids — along with about 46 pounds of meth, 35 pounds of cannabis, 100 grams of fentanyl, and millions in us and canadian cash. White, 45, who became the first native american driver in the sprint cup series last july, faces three counts of conspiracy to commit fraud against the government, three counts of fraud toward the government, and one count of profiteering as a criminal organization. Per a chart police provided to bloomberg, white was listed as one of the highest-ranking members of the smuggling organization. \" this is the largest operation we've had to this day in connection to contraband tobacco, and also in cross-border crime between canada and the united states, \" says a quebec official.",

Then a researcher spotted a baby clinging to its mother's abdomen. \" i had this radical idea that maybe spider moms feed their babies with something they produced, \" zhanqi chen of the chinese academy of science tells new scientist of the jumping spider toxeus magnus. He was spot on: it turns out mothers feed their offspring \" milk, \" similar to mammals, the researchers report in science. Technically, the secretion from the abdomen might not be milk — spiders don't have the special glands required — but it's at least milk-ish, perhaps made up of partially digested eggs that went unfertilized, explains popular science. And when researchers describe it as a \" nutritious milk-like substance, \" they're not kidding. The stuff has four times the protein of cow's milk. Researchers found that the mother continues feeding her offspring for about 40 days, though the spiders are able to leave the nest at 20 days and begin supplementing their diet with insects. Generally, females were allowed to return more frequently to feed than their male counterparts, reports gizmodo. When the scientists blocked the mother's secretion glands, her baby spiders died after about 10 days. And if they removed her from the nest at 20 days, the babies had a significantly lower rate of survival. When it comes to spiders, \" this type of maternal care may be more widespread than has been assumed, \" the researchers conclude. ( spider fans will want to visit this greek town. )",

Steck's family said the exact circumstances of his death were still unclear. \" the family is infinitely sad and asks that the media refrain from speculating about his death out of respect and consideration for ueli, \" it said in a statement on steck's website, per the ap. Steck was planning to climb 29,035-foot everest and nearby mount lhotse next month. He was the first casualty in nepal's spring mountaineering season that began in march and will end in may. Hundreds of foreign climbers are on the mountains to attempt to scale himalayan peaks when there are a few windows of favorable weather. The 40-year-old steck was one of the most-renowned mountaineers of his generation. He was best known for his speed-climbing, including setting several records for ascending the north face of the eiger, a peak in the bernese alps he climbed in two hours and 47 minutes without a rope. In 2015, steck climbed all 82 peaks in the alps higher than 13,100 feet, traveling between mountains by foot, bike, and paraglider only. He finished the feat in 62 days, cementing his reputation as the \" swiss machine. \" \" a record is broken again and again, and the world keeps on turning, \" steck recently mused. \" you are getting older and there comes a time when you have to adjust your projects to your age. \" asked about the upcoming expedition, steck told swiss daily tages-anzeiger last month: \" of course i want to climb everest and lhotse. But that's a very high goal. Failure for me would be to die and not come home. \" ( steck last year discovered the bodies of two climbers lost in tibet in 1999. )",

        "summary": "Talking to yourself doesn't mean you're crazy. In fact, the habit might be downright smart. That's the takeaway from a new study in scientific reports, which involved two separate experiments. In the first, researchers at michigan state university and the university of michigan monitored the brain activity of 29 students who were asked to review neutral and disturbing images and talk about how they felt while referring to themselves in the first and third persons, reports today. In the second, researchers asked 50 participants to internally reflect on painful experiences in the same way. In both cases, \" third person self-talk \" allowed participants to better regulate their emotions to relieve stress, researchers say. \" it kind of switches you to a different mode of experiencing negative emotions when you use your name rather than the word, ' i, ' \" says the lead researcher. Indeed, when students were met with disturbing images, activity in the regions of the brain involving emotions decreased within one second of third person self-talk, reports newsweek. Both experiments also showed referring to oneself in the third person required no more effort than referring to oneself in the first person and much less effort than other forms of emotion regulation, like positive thinking. With third person self-talk, \" it's like you're viewing [ a situation ] from an outsider perspective \" and gaining \" a tiny bit of psychological distance, \" researcher jason moser explains, per a release. \" it really does help. \" an example, he says, would be to tell yourself, \" jason is really scared \" and explain why during a stress-inducing situation.

        "summary": "Before you assume the attractive woman married to the rich guy is a trophy wife, read this: a new study finds that stereotype is largely a myth. The belief goes that, when it comes to mates, rich men care about physical attractiveness more than any other attribute ( like level of education or success ), while attractive women care more about money than anything else ( like physical appearance ). But researchers found, when looking at a nationally representative sample of couples, \" handsome men partner with pretty women and successful men partner with successful women, \" says sociologist and lead author elizabeth mcclintock. She also found that it's fairly rare for an attractive woman from a lower social class to move upward via marriage, according to the press release — and, in fact, men are just as likely to do so, new york reports. \" high-status men \" do, on average, have more attractive wives, mcclintock notes, but that's because the men themselves are also considered more attractive than their less successful counterparts. Why is that? \" perhaps because they are less likely to be overweight and more likely to afford braces, nice clothes, and trips to the dermatologist, \" mcclintock suggests. Though \" trophy wife \" partnerships do exist — mcclintock points to donald trump and melania knauss-trump — they're rare. \" i've heard doctors ' wives referred to as trophy wives by observers who only notice her looks and his status and fail to realize that he is good-looking too and that she is also a successful professional, \" mcclintock notes. The most important factor when it comes to who will marry? similarity. ( a recent study found you may have more in common with your spouse than you think — like dna. )",

            "Don't be so quick to judge. Most people are familiar with the \" trophy wife \" stereotype that attractive women marry rich men, placing little importance on their other traits, including physical appearance, and that men look for pretty wives but don't care about their education or earnings. New research, however, by university of notre dame sociologist elizabeth mcclintock, shows the trophy wife stereotype is largely a myth fueled by selective observation that reinforces sexist stereotypes and trivializes women's careers. In \" beauty and status: the illusion of exchange in partner selection? \" forthcoming in american sociological review, mcclintock resolves the paradox between the trophy wife stereotype and the evidence that couples match on both physical attractiveness and socioeconomic status. Using, for the first time, a nationally representative sample of young couples in which both partners were interviewed and rated for physical attractiveness, mcclintock was able to control for matching on attractiveness. She says prior research in this area has ignored two important factors. \" i find that handsome men partner with pretty women and successful men partner with successful women, \" says mcclintock, who specializes in inequality within romantic partnerships. \" so, on average, high-status men do have better-looking wives, but this is because they themselves are considered better looking -- perhaps because they are less likely to be",
            "Photo: frazer harrison/getty images trophy wives are a constant source of media and pop-culture fixation, and for understandable reasons: one, they tend to be beautiful, and two, they tend to be hitched to powerful, prominent men. Underlying the concept, of course, is a particularly old-fashioned notion of gender, of who seeks what in a relationship — but one which has been supported by certain empirical literature on relationship and marriage patterns. An important new study argues that this idea, and the research backing it, may be a myth that can be explained by biased misinterpretations of who is pairing with whom, and why. The paper, written by elizabeth aura mcclintock of notre dame and published in american sociological review, examined a big data set of heterosexual young-adult couples to better figure out how people choose a mate. Mcclintock discusses two mechanisms at work that potentially help explain the pairing process: matching and exchange.

            "Don't be so quick to judge. Most people are familiar with the \" trophy wife \" stereotype that attractive women marry rich men, placing little importance on their other traits, including physical appearance, and that men look for pretty wives but don't care about their education or earnings. New research, however, by university of notre dame sociologist elizabeth mcclintock, shows the trophy wife stereotype is largely a myth fueled by selective observation that reinforces sexist stereotypes and trivializes women's careers. In \" beauty and status: the illusion of exchange in partner selection? \" forthcoming in american sociological review, mcclintock resolves the paradox between the trophy wife stereotype and the evidence that couples match on both physical attractiveness and socioeconomic status. Using, for the first time, a nationally representative sample of young couples in which both partners were interviewed and rated for physical attractiveness, mcclintock was able to control for matching on attractiveness. She says prior research in this area has ignored two important factors. \" i find that handsome men partner with pretty women and successful men partner with successful women, \" says mcclintock, who specializes in inequality within romantic partnerships. \" so, on average, high-status men do have better-looking wives, but this is because they themselves are considered better looking -- perhaps because they are less likely to be",
            "Photo: frazer harrison/getty images trophy wives are a constant source of media and pop-culture fixation, and for understandable reasons: one, they tend to be beautiful, and two, they tend to be hitched to powerful, prominent men. Underlying the concept, of course, is a particularly old-fashioned notion of gender, of who seeks what in a relationship — but one which has been supported by certain empirical literature on relationship and marriage patterns. An important new study argues that this idea, and the research backing it, may be a myth that can be explained by biased misinterpretations of who is pairing with whom, and why. The paper, written by elizabeth aura mcclintock of notre dame and published in american sociological review, examined a big data set of heterosexual young-adult couples to better figure out how people choose a mate. Mcclintock discusses two mechanisms at work that potentially help explain the pairing process: matching and exchange. Matching is the notion that people \"select a partner with similar characteristics \" to themselves when it comes to education, attractiveness, and other characteristics. Exchange, on the other hand, is the idea of someone trading beauty or status to land a partner who has what they lack.

Politico delves into the flights, finding that, for at least one jaunt that likely cost about $ 25,000 ( between washington, dc, and philadelphia ), a much cheaper united airlines flight ( hundreds of dollars for a ticket, not tens of thousands ) was available at almost exactly the same departure time out of dulles. There were also similar commercial flights available from the other two dc-area airports, four amtrak trains ( one of which would have cost just $ 72 per person ), or of course, price's party could have driven the 125 miles. Price wouldn't comment and hhs spokespeople wouldn't confirm details of the flights or say who paid, but the three organizations that hosted price ( the flights took him to a q&a discussion at a maine resort as well as community health centers, with a trip back to dc in between all that for an announcement ) confirm they did not pay for price's travel costs. Charter operators estimate the costs for the five flights amounted to at least $ 60,000. An hhs spokesperson would only say that charter planes are sometimes used \" when commercial aircraft cannot reasonably accommodate travel requirements, \" but no one would explain why commercial travel was considered to be unfeasible in this instance. Current and former staffers say, anonymously, that price often travels via private jet, a move ethics experts say is a dubious use of taxpayer funding. Democrats have vowed to investigate.

        "summary": "Dna testing has improved to the point where it is starting to incriminate the wrong people in some cases, experts warn. The problem is super-sensitive equipment and dna transfer, which can lead to a person's dna being found on a body or murder weapon even if they had only shaken hands with the real criminal or visited the crime scene, reports nbc news, quoting a column from dna analyst cynthia cale in the journal nature. New dna kits can identify a person from even the tiniest scraps of biological material, cale writes, but when juries are told there is a \" one-in-a-quadrillion chance that the evidence retrieved from the crime scene did not come from a defendant, \" they aren't usually told about the possibility of transfer, she writes. Cale — who says we \" urgently need to review how dna evidence is assessed, viewed, and described \" — cites the case of an innocent man who spent months in jail after his dna was found on a murder victim, having been transferred there by paramedics who took the man to a hospital before going to the murder scene. At the new republic, law professor erin murphy describes how dna transfer initially led police to an impossible suspect in the 2009 murder of yale student annie le. After her body was found in her lab's crawl space, dna found on her skin and underwear matched that of a convicted offender in the area. He had left dna behind when he carried out construction work in the lab, murphy writes, but he might still have gone to prison for the crime — if he hadn't died two years earlier.",

Most of the sun belt states can bask in their 9.5 to 10.5 hours of rays, while parts of alaska will receive anywhere from seven hours to … none. A mesmerizing time-lapse video shows the somewhat freaky occurrence of the winter solstice in fairbanks, alaska, where the sun glides along the horizon for a grand total of three hours or so before once more dipping into oblivion. An explainer for the mechanics behind the solstice ( including tilting angles and degrees ) comes courtesy of live science. National geographic explains why 2016's earliest sunset doesn't take place wednesday, but actually earlier in december for most of us. It all comes down to how our clocks don't quite sync up with the earth's. A walk back through winter solstices past is offered by the huffington post, which looks at pagan rituals of yesteryear and how they've morphed into modern-day ceremonies at places like stonehenge.

But the vast majority that comprise what's called our microbiome seem to do helpful things, like keep our immune and digestive systems healthy. And because one family's microbiome is unique from another's, the researchers say that comparing them among the seven families they tracked ( including three kids, three dogs, and a cat ) was a reliable way to tell them apart, much like fingerprints. \" the speed at which that colonization happens was quite remarkable, \" the head researcher tells ap. His team found that a place's old germs largely go dormant or die when new people arrive and their own bacteria take over, which \" changed my perspective almost on hotel rooms, \" he says. Within homes, similar bacteria was most often found on people's hands, while variation peaked when found in people's noses. Not surprisingly, indoor-outdoor cats and dogs bring plant and soil bacteria into the environment. One open question: where do the bugs we bring into our homes come from?

While at first the pics were circulated as poignant symbols of the refugee situation in germany, they quickly became appropriated on social media, using the 19-year-old's face to accompany \" news \" stories accusing him of taking part in terrorist or otherwise criminal activity, including iding him as one of the perpetrators of the march bombings in brussels and linking him to the christmas market attack in berlin. His lawyer notes that every time there's a refugee issue, his client is \" wheeled out as an icon, as merkel's model refugee, \" and \" smeared \" as a criminal. When fake claims about modamani's ties to the brussels attacks started going around, he tells the bbc that friends told him to just lie low and ignore them, which he did. But the berlin attack bubbled his likeness back to the surface, and he said he got \" fed up, \" spurring him to file an injunction against a european facebook subsidiary from publishing any \" slanderous image \" portraying him as a terrorist or criminal. Facebook says an injunction isn't needed, because it disabled a \" specific piece of content \" modamani had asked it to take down, but his lawyer says other pictures are still floating around. \" facebook is doing a very poor job with fake news, but it is especially doing a poor job with illegal fake news, \" modamani says. ( facebook promises a crackdown on bogus news posts in germany. )",

Here's a sample: robert lloyd, los angeles times: \" what is the legacy of these critically acclaimed, low-rated, award-winning seven seasons? \" he asks. The \" show is itself too singular — and too unsuccessful, in its context — to have spawned a school of obvious followers; if anything, network comedy seems to be swinging the other way.... But that it exists at all, an unlikely thing in an unlikely place, like a flower finding a crack in a sea of concrete, is in itself inspiring. \" jen chaney slate, concord monitor: fey's success \" just so happened to occur on the front end of what has been a very encouraging time for women working in the industry. More high-profile comedies — from girls to the big c to enlightened to the new girl and the mindy project, which serve as anchors for fox's tuesday night comedy block — are being created or co-created by women and placing dynamic, dysfunctional and funny female characters at the center of their narratives. \" fey may not be directly responsible, but surely she played a role. Alessandra stanley, new york times: \" fey is a pioneer who resists being taken too seriously. She prefers to be revered for her irreverence. But one sign of her influence is her ability to persuade powerful, sensible women to go on 30 rock and make fools of themselves. \" ( it's nancy pelosi's turn tonight. ) one quibble: stanley thinks fey's casting of herself as a frumpy nerd was the \" weakest \" part of the show. \" she was never fully convincing in the role of a loser. \" emma keller, the guardian: fey had great fun poking holes in female stereotypes, writes keller, who rounds up her favorite \" feminist \" scenes here.",

        "summary": "With president trump blaming forest management for california wildfires, many wonder about the role of climate change — and scientists say it is a factor, national geographic reports. While wildfires are normal in california, the state's fires have generally gotten larger since 2000 as hotter and drier years go on record. That means warmed air is drawing water from soils and plants, making shrubs, trees, and grasslands more likely to burn. The summer dry season is also getting longer, letting plants get drier. \" we've been lengthening fire season by shortening the precipitation season, and we're warming throughout, \" says ucla climate scientist daniel swain. \" that's essentially what's enabled these recent fires to be so destructive, at times of the year when you wouldn't really expect them. \" for more, including fox news'take: wet and dry: climate change also brings high variations of rain and snowfall, making some years wet and others dry, per voa news. That means more fire-starting growth some years, and drier growth other years — perfect for a wildfire.",

            "Two devastating wildfires have ravaged parts of california, and the death toll friday reached 71 with more than 1,000 missing, officials said. Experts suggest many causes for the fires, from population growth to equipment failures to climate change. They say this year's deadly blazes may point to worse to come. Jennifer balch, director of earth lab at the university of colorado boulder, said fires in the american west are intensifying. \"we've seen a five-fold increase in the number of large fires since the 1970s, \" she said. \"so, for every 20 that we saw in the 1970s, today we see 100. \" the area that is burned has also doubled, balch said. ​extremes in snow, rain climate change has brought warmer temperatures and extreme variations in snow and rainfall, causing both dry and wet years, said leroy westerling, who studies wildfires and climate at the university of california, merced. He said the variations bring more fires \"because in the really wet years, you're growing more fine fuels, and in the really dry years, you're making them very flammable. \" fires that move quickly through tinder-dry brush can also be more deadly, westerling said, like the fast-moving fire that destroyed most of the town of paradise in northern california. Westerling said california's extended fire season now stretches into late fall, when dry conditions delay the winter rains, and gusty winds fan the fires that are still burning. ​potential causes behind wildfires shifting population means more chances for ignitions, with \"people moving into flammable places and literally building homes in the line of fire, \" balch said. She said humans cause 84 percent of wildfires, and lightning causes the rest. Malfunctioning equipment and downed power lines are behind many blazes, and authorities are trying to learn if equipment failures by utility companies sparked the two large california blazes. Careless campers are responsible for some fires, balch said, and the most dangerous day for fires in the united states is independence day, the fourth of july, when fireworks spark both structural and wildfires. ​deadly fires not forest fires westerling said forest management, cited by president donald trump as a factor in these fires, is important in reducing the intensity of some fires and maintaining the carbon balance in the atmosphere — a vital role of forests — but that the deadly fires started on",
            "There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in california except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more fed payments!"

In missouri's case, not disclosing your hiv status to a partner, as johnson's accusers alleged and he denied, can be a felony. The aclu of missouri is backing johnson, and as the st. Louis post-dispatch reports, flagged what it ( and others ) perceive to be problems with the conviction and sentence: that the \" law under which he is charged is based on outdated science. \" critics of such laws cite significant medical advances and note that while the person with hiv faces legal repercussions, the partner who chose to have unprotected sex does not, reported buzzfeed last year. Buzzfeed separately reports on what was in those taped calls: johnson saying his level of confidence that he had alerted his partners to his status was \" pretty sure. \" the court pointed out it was \" the only evidence in the record of johnson stating to anyone that he was not certain, \" making it \" highly prejudicial evidence \" that johnson's defense should have had time to prepare to for.

Pollsters say that while it isn't clear whether carson's popularity will endure, he's currently the most respected candidate running for president from either party and has a broad appeal for gop voters, with 50 % putting him as either their first or second choice. The poll, which found that only 29 % of americans have favorable views of the gop, has more bad news for bush: for the first time, a majority of voters say they wouldn't even consider voting for him, the journal notes. The candidate, whose campaign was widely seen to be in big trouble after a poor debate performance last week, rolled out new campaign slogan \" jeb can fix it \" on monday as part of a campaign \" reset \" that will see him spend more time in iowa and new hampshire, the globe and mail reports.

Simpson, 23, was driving home thursday with her 4-month-old daughter and 78-year-old grandmother when it started raining. As the rain started to come down harder, she pulled over. Then, it started to hail — and the hail shattered the window next to the infant. That's when simpson decided to act as a human shield for the baby, shielding the girl with her own body and later trying to also help her grandmother when hail broke the front window of the car. The trio was caught in a \" supercell thunderstorm, \" a rare type of storm featuring a \" persistent rotating updraft called a mesocyclone, \" per weather.gov. It caused giant hail and a tornado, per weatherwatch; abc has pictures of the queensland havoc. Simpson and her grandmother both suffered significant bruising, and the skin on one of the grandmother's arms was shredded. The infant, though, just ended up with some small bumps, though simpson says she was screaming in terror during the incident \" but i couldn't even hear her, it was just so loud. \" simpson says she's been overwhelmed with supportive messages since her story made headlines: \" people are offering to help, offering to send me ointments and creams, offering to buy me a massage, a few insurance companies have offered to replace my car. \" ( this mom saved a pregnant mom and her toddler from drowning. )",

Roquel bain, 26, who was visiting from ohio, planned to go on a \" haunted \" tour of louisville's former tuberculosis clinic with her boyfriend saturday when the pair heard a local legend about the pope lick monster, a half-man, half-goat creature said to appear to those who climb the trestle across pope lick creek and cross its 772-foot length, per wtol. They decided to attempt the crossing, but a train suddenly appeared blaring its horn, reports the washington post. Bain's boyfriend hung off the side of the trestle as the train passed, but bain couldn't get out of the way in time. She was hit by the train about 40 feet from the trestle's end, per the louisville courier-journal. Her body was found some 100 feet below. \" it's just so sad — a very pretty young girl who had her life in front of her. It's just so preventable, \" a coroner says. \" i see a train pass every 30 minutes or so, \" adds a local. \" it's shocking, people hear about so many deaths and they still take the risk. \" the parklands notes at least three teens have died from trips to the trestle. It isn't clear where the fable first originated, but it's been around for three generations. A local historian cites a story about a man who tortured a herd of goats for satan. Others say the monster was a circus freak who escaped the circus train. The legend picked up followers in the 1980s with a short film. The \" goatman \" with furry goat legs and horns is said to mimic familiar voices to get his victims to the trestle and finishes off those who avoid a train with a rusty axe.

Word of the rift threatens to politicize the case and widen the gulf between dems and republicans over the financial overhaul the white house is pushing, the wall street journal notes.

            "For months, goldman sachs and the securities and exchange commission had been involved in secret talks over allegations that the wall street bank defrauded customers in selling them investments designed to fail. Then, after a crucial meeting last month between lawyers for goldman and the sec, the agency came to a fork in the road. Even after sec lawyers had told goldman in writing they were prepared to file a federal suit, the firm gave no ground, declining to ask for a settlement, according to three people familiar with the case. The agency could prolong negotiations in hopes of reaching a deal goldman would accept, as the sec had often done in previous cases, or take the bank to court. Endorsing the recommendation of investigators, the sec's five-member commission voted 3 to 2 to proceed with the civil suit, taking a high-stakes gamble that pits wall street's top regulator against its most storied bank. The case, filed friday, has provoked a counteroffensive from goldman, which says it was blindsided by the suit. Goldman's defenders are suggesting that the suit may have been designed to help make the case for the obama administration's push this month for legislation to overhaul financial regulation. Sec officials say that they told goldman last summer the agency would probably bring action, and that the bank did not show any contrition. At the same time, they say they wanted to use the goldman case to make a broader statement about the agency's renewed intention of holding prominent financial firms accountable for misconduct. Neither sec officials nor goldman executives would discuss the internal dynamics of the case on the record. But people in both camps were preparing monday for an epic court battle that could offer a chance for both sides to restore their reputations after they were sullied during the financial crisis.

Bharara was one of 46 federal attorneys ordered to resign late last week by the justice department, though he says he refused to do so and was fired instead. A look at coverage: expect lots of chatter about a run for office. The 48-year-old has previously said he's not interested, but this run-in with the white house might mean that \" his political star is rising, \" reports the new york times in a story that takes a broad look at his career. He's out of his job, but there's some disagreement on whether he was technically fired, as cnbc explains. Bharara has the reputation of being an aggressive prosecutor willing to take on big names, but propublica points to what it sees as a glaring exception: he brought no cases against top wall street execs in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse. Read the assessment here. \" by the way, now i know what the moreland commission must have felt like. \" that tweet from bharara, referring to a political corruption investigation that was shut down in new york, is drawing attention. Is he suggesting he got fired because he was investigating the white house? the week takes a look. One person who is probably pretty happy that bharara is gone? rupert murdoch.
