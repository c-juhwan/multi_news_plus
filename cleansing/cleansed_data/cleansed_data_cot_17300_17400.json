        "summary": "Major british advertisers wary of being associated with nazis, islamic radicals, and homophobic preachers have been pulling their ads from youtube and google. The british government joined big banks and other companies in the ad boycott in recent days after their ads appeared next to extremist content, mashable reports. The ad placement was first highlighted by a sunday times report that warned the blacklist system was failing and major advertisers might be unwittingly funding hate groups. The times ' investigation found that ads from big companies were appearing next to content from former kkk leader david duke, among others, techcrunch reports. Google has apologized for the ad placement, which it describes as a \" small number of inappropriately monetized videos and content, \" and promised to start giving advertisers more control over where their ads appear, usa today reports. Advertising firm wpp says it's working on damage control with google and other clients. \" we have always said google, facebook, and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company, \" company founder martin sorrell tells reuters. \" they cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements. \"",

Federally, a person must prove they have had a gender-reassignment surgery to change the gender on their social security or passport. According to the smith college website, the student body includes individuals who identify as transgender. The page also notes that \" to be eligible for review, a student's application and supporting documentation ( transcripts, recommendations, etc. ) will reflect her status as a woman. \" in an earlier post, wong wrote: \" but in order to be legally recognized as ' female ' on my birth certificate according to both massachusetts and connecticut law, i have to undergo vaginoplasty ( feminizing genital surgery ). From what i understand, smith college will only evaluate me as a'real ' girl if i get sex reassignment surgery. \" wong adds: \" transwomen are most likely not ready"

        "summary": "The blaze that ripped through a converted warehouse in oakland, calif., during a party on friday has now been confirmed as america's deadliest fire in more than a decade — and authorities say more than half the wreckage of the \" ghost ship \" warehouse hasn't been searched yet. Oakland mayor libby schaaf announced sunday that a criminal investigation team is now looking into the disaster, abc7 reports. The ap reports that the warehouse, which wasn't licensed for residential or entertainment use, was already being investigated for alleged code violations. In other developments: those confirmed dead include many young artists and musicians, with the youngest victims aged 17 and the oldest in their 30s, the san francisco chronicle reports. In a tragic coincidence, one victim is the son of a deputy for the alameda county sheriff's office, which has been tasked with removing bodies from the scene. The san jose mercury news reports that derick ion almena, the man who created the \" ghost ship \" artists ' collective — and allegedly ignored warnings about fire safety — is being called \" selfish and careless \" in the wake of the disaster. He caused outrage after the fire when he failed to mention the victims in a facebook post, lamenting instead that \" everything i worked so hard for is gone. \" almena lived in the warehouse with his wife and children, but they were not present during the fire. Visitors and former residents describe the warehouse as a \" cluttered deathtrap \" that had been carved into many artists'studios, with only a rickety staircase made partly of pallets connecting the second floor, where many died, with the first floor, the ap reports. Associates say almena leased the warehouse and rented out rvs and other spaces to artists. Events like friday's party were held to help raise rent money. Oakland fire battalion chief melinda drayton warns that the search and recovery process could take a long time, cnn reports. Firefighters are removing debris \" literally bucket by bucket in a methodical, thoughtful, mindful, and compassionate way, \" she said sunday. The fire was among the deadliest building fires in the us in the last 50 years, reports nbc news, which lists the worst 10 from that period. The oakland fire is the seventh on a list that includes 9/11 and the oklahoma city bombing. Another mercury news story looks at how rising rents elsewhere created a thriving artistic community in oakland's warehouses, which could now be forced out. \" the city's gonna paint us as some ugly, crusty, punk kids that are up to no good, \" says katelyn",

But irene was weaker than expected in many places along the east coast — especially in new york city, where so much of the national media is located.

The study, which looked at nearly 3,000 seniors over a 10-year period, claims that 11 to 14 hours of \" speed training \" may reduce the risk of developing dementia a decade later by 48 %, the wall street journal reports. It's a result that no other type of brain game — or anything else — has been able to achieve. \"if you can reduce the chance of getting dementia by nearly 50 % with this, that's huge, \" says an expert at the cleveland clinic not involved with the study. Speed training uses a computer program to get people to quickly identify images in the center of their field of vision and match them with images on the periphery. Researchers can't explain how a few hours of training can have such a profound effect a decade later. Reuters reports it's also unclear if the study, which started with healthy participants, would have the same result with people already at risk for dementia. The study hasn't been peer-reviewed or published yet, but the lead researcher, who recommends speed training starting at age 50, says \"the potential to benefit is great and the risks are none to minimal. \" ( another study claims to have found a delicious way to fight dementia. )",

In a new study, researchers found that the creatures were able to reach a depth of nearly 1.9 miles, reuters reports. In another record-breaking dive, a beaked whale was able to hold its breath for two hours and 17 minutes. Those figures surpass the 1.5-mile and two-hour dives of elephant seals, which, the bbc notes, had previously held those records among mammals. The results come from 3,700 hours of diving data on eight tagged whales. The creatures ' average dives measured almost 0.9 miles, and they usually lasted more than an hour, the guardian notes. How do they do it? for one thing, their bodies have very reduced air spaces, notes an expert: \" it is the presence of air spaces within the body that would crush a human at a fraction of the depths these whales can dive. \" what's more, their muscles are packed with a protein called myoglobin, which lets them store vast amounts of oxygen.

Scientists said on wednesday they tracked these medium-sized whales off the coast of california using satellite-linked tags as the creatures dove down nearly 1.9 miles and spent two hours and 17 minutes underwater before resurfacing. Those are breath-taking accomplishments for an air-breathing creature. In fact, those figures represent both the deepest and the longest dives ever documented for any marine mammal, said greg schorr of the cascadia research collective in olympia, washington, who led the study published in the journal plos one. \" many creatures live at the depths these whales dive to, including their likely primary prey of",

Erin falcone is a research biologist with the cascadia research collective in washington state, us, which led the research project.

Thanks to some clever satellite-linked tags, however, marine biologists have been able to collect data that reveal its diving behaviour in unprecedented detail.

Scientists said on wednesday they tracked these medium-sized whales off the coast of california using satellite-linked tags as the creatures dove down nearly 1.9 miles and spent two hours and 17 minutes underwater before resurfacing. Those are breath-taking accomplishments for an air-breathing creature. In fact, those figures represent both the deepest and the longest dives ever documented for any marine mammal, said greg schorr of the cascadia research collective in olympia, washington, who led the study published in the journal plos one. \" many creatures live at the depths these whales dive to, including their likely primary prey of",
            "Image copyright spl image caption the elusive creatures are very difficult to study cuvier's beaked whales are likely to be the most extreme breath-holders among marine mammals. Satellite tags attached to these animals, swimming off the coast of california, recorded a dive to nearly 3km below the ocean surface, and one that lasted 137 minutes. This performance exceeds that for any southern elephant seal, which is also known to be an extreme breath-holder. The cuvier's record-breaking dives are reported in the journal plos one. Erin falcone is a research biologist with the cascadia research collective in washington state, us, which led the research project. She told bbc news that beaked whales had very high levels of the myoglobin protein in their muscles, to the point where the tissues appeared almost black. This functions like haemoglobin in the blood, allowing the whales to store much higher levels of oxygen",
            "The southern elephant seal is famous for its diving talents, for many years recognised as the marine mammal with the deepest and longest dive on record. But researchers in the us have identified a new champ: cuvier's beaked whale. Cuvier's beaked whale was always a contender, but its diving habits are so extreme it has proved a difficult species to study. Thanks to some clever satellite-linked tags, however, marine biologists have been able to collect data that reveal its diving behaviour in unprecedented detail. One of the whales they tracked went on a monster dive to a depth of almost 3km. Another individual performed a dive that saw it holding its breath for an incredible 137.5 minutes. These are both \"new mammalian dive records, �? report gregory schorr and colleagues in a paper just out in plos one. The researchers managed to attach dive recorders on or near"

The yellow \" microdots \" formed a coded design on the paper the 25-year-old nsa contractor allegedly provided to the intercept that purports to detail russian interference in the november election. The pattern revealed the serial number of the printer used, and clocked the time recorded on the unit's date stamp: 06: 20 on 9 may, 2017. Known to civil libertarians and security experts, but not to most of us, most color printers add microdots every time a user hits \" send, \" allowing an easy path to tracking the source, per the bbc. After the intercept published the leaked doc, techies rushed to decode the dots and tweet their findings. \" zooming in on the document, they were pretty obvious, \" one tells the bbc. The electronic frontier foundation explains how it works, as does the blog errata security, which calls the subtle spyware \" evil. \" the fbi hasn't commented on the dots, which is a form of steganography, or hidden messages. The practice of using dots for spycraft dates back to world war ii, per the bbc, and today it can foil counterfeiting on currency notes, as most printers won't produce a copy when they detect a constellation symbol stamped on most banknotes. Besides symbols, white space can also encode text by placing spaces and tabs in a particular position. \"locating trailing whitespace in text is like finding a polar bear in a snowstorm, \" the snow website says, per the bbc.

No'special path ': they would attain that legal status not through a \" special path \" — republicans say that would be unfair to those who have followed the rules — but only after they \" admit their culpability, pass rigorous background checks, pay significant fines and back taxes, develop proficiency in english and american civics, and be able to support themselves and their families ( without access to public benefits ). \" citizenship for'dreamers ': kids brought here illegally by their parents — often referred to collectively as the \" dreamers \" — would get a path to citizenship.

Chuck schumer: \" while these standards are certainly not everything we would agree with, they leave a real possibility that democrats and republicans... Can in some way come together and pass immigration reform. \" john boehner: in releasing the plan, he sought to emphasize what the gop won't do. \" these standards are as far as we are willing to go. Nancy pelosi said yesterday that for her caucus, it is a special path to citizenship or nothing. If democrats insist on that, then we are not going to get anywhere this year",

        "summary": "Researchers are offering a helpful hint to chinese men hoping to \" avoid disability and premature death \": stop smoking. Of the million people who died from smoking in china in 2010, 84 % were male, reports afp. A new study in the lancet finds the annual death toll in china — which consumes a third of the world's cigarettes — is on track to climb in the next few decades, reaching 2 million by 2030 and 3 million by 2050. \" about two-thirds of young chinese men become cigarette smokers, and most start before they are 20, \" says a researcher. \" unless they stop, about half of them will eventually be killed by their habit. \" only 2.4 % of chinese women smoke, per the bbc, and just 1 % of deaths in women 55 and younger are attributed to smoking. Conversely, smoking is blamed for 20 % of deaths in chinese men aged 40-79, researchers say, based on two studies of 730,000. The report doesn't offer all gloom: it shows the percentage of smokers who quit grew from 3 % in 1991 to 9 % in 2006, and those who quit before they developed any serious illness had about the same disease risk as non-smokers after 10 years, which should encourage others to drop the habit. However, only 10 % quit by choice; the others were too ill to continue, reports the bbc. If concern for their own health doesn't compel more people to quit, a price hike might do the trick. A study author explains smoking rates have fallen in western countries partly because of rising prices. In china, where a popular pack sells for $ 1.50 cents, \" a substantial increase in cigarette prices could save tens of millions of lives, \" he says. A commentary accompanying the study notes more than 7 % of the chinese government's annual revenue comes from tobacco sales and taxes, which \" complicates \" anti-smoking efforts, reports cnn.",

The scientists conducted two nationwide studies, 15 years apart, covering hundreds of thousands of people. In 2010, around one million people in china died from tobacco usage. But researchers say that if current trends continue, that will double to two million people - mostly men - dying every year by 2030, making it a \" growing epidemic of premature death \".

        "summary": "In an interview on thursday, president trump described a dinner with then-fbi chief james comey soon after he took office. Now the new york times has a different account, based on people who heard about the january dinner afterward from comey himself. The big takeaway: comey said trump pressed him for a pledge of personal loyalty, and comey explained that as fbi chief, he couldn't deliver one. What's more, comey now thinks this foreshadowed his firing months later. By the times ' account, trump brought up the issue early, asking comey if he'd pledge his loyalty, but comey responded that he could instead only promise to be honest with the president. Trump returned to the matter later in the dinner, asking comey if it would be \" honest loyalty, \" and the fbi chief responded, \" you will have that. \" the white house is pushing back against this narrative, with a spokesperson saying that trump \" would never even suggest the expectation of personal loyalty, only loyalty to our country and its great people. \" cnn, however, also talks to comey associates who say that his refusal to pledge personal loyalty is one of two reasons he was fired, the other being the widening russia investigation. Nbc news, meanwhile, reports that comey did not request the dinner, as the president said. Instead, the white house summoned him. Comey was reportedly leery of going but didn't feel like he could turn down a president. The times notes that trump has long insisted on loyalty among his business associates and suggests that as a political novice, he wasn't familiar with the tradition that fbi chiefs eschew that. Congress gave them 10-year terms in order to bolster their independence.",

Then, yesterday, nuzzi appeared on the front cover of the new york daily news. Inside, she bylined an article about working on the campaign, claiming that many interns only came onboard in the hopes of connecting with weiner's wife, huma abedin. Nuzzi also trashed the \" short résumés \" of many campaign staffers... Including, yes, communications director barbara morgan, who \" last worked as the press secretary for the new jersey state education commissioner, \" nuzzi wrote. That's when morgan responded in a conversation with talking points memo ( about an unrelated story ) in which she used the aforementioned terms, and also said she \" tried to fire \" nuzzi at one point because \" she sucked \" at her job. One example: \" she like wasn't good at setting up events.... Like it was, like, terrible and i had to like — she would like, she would just not show up for work, \" morgan explained. \" and then like she had the f --- ing balls to like trash me in the paper. \" oh, it gets more amusing from there; we'd highly recommend you read the whole thing. Not surprisingly, morgan put out a statement last night to business insider: \" in a moment of frustration, i used inappropriate language in what i thought was an off the record conversation.

Acirema alayeto, miss america latina's national director, says caitlin cifuentes has had her crown revoked and has been replaced by runner-up valeria barrera, action 10 reports. Barrera was one of six runners-up from the june 11 pageant who sued the pageant's local director, saying the 25-year-old cifuentes should not have been allowed to compete because of issues such as her deferred adjudicated probation on a 2013 charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. She is also on probation for a misdemeanor dui stemming from the same incident in 2013, a car crash that injured four. Cifuentes and local pageant director kayla alvarez had argued that cifuentes technically had no convictions and no pending charges, which made her eligible to compete, the corpus christi caller-times reports. Alayeto countered that cifuentes has to complete the probation to avoid a conviction, so the assault charge — which she pleaded guilty to — should be considered pending. Cifuentes will no longer be eligible for the national pageant, reports the houston chronicle, which notes that the organization's motto is \" more than a model... A role model. \" in a facebook post, cifuentes thanked supporters and described herself as a positive role model. \" everyone makes mistakes but what you do after is what counts, \" she wrote.",

Cary sharp was caught on camera dressed like a member of the ku klux klan at a halloween party on a property in lahoma. It was a bonfire and the photo shows torches and a cross but cary sharp and his friends insisted no cross was burned despite flames being visible behind it in the photo. News 9 spoke with the woman who reported it to police and like many others, she was outraged by this and embarrassed for the community.

        "summary": "Nasa's latest out-of-this-world feat happened on planet earth: thanks to the space agency's technology, four men trapped for days after the nepal earthquake were rescued. The village of chautara received two prototype finder devices four days after the disaster struck, gizmodo reports. The development of the handheld gadgets — whose name is an acronym for finding individuals for disaster and emergency response — was actually spurred by technology intended for studying the possibility of alien life, the site notes. The devices fire out what quartz describes as a \" continuous microwave signal, \" using radar to detect heartbeats or breathing, and can discern the presence of a human from the movement of an animal. They've been shown to work through 30 feet of rubble or 20 feet of solid concrete, nasa reports. In this case, the four men in two separate buildings were found buried below up to 10 feet of debris. The rescue marked the first time finder has been used in a real-life situation, gizmodo notes. \" finder exemplifies how technology designed for space exploration has profound impacts to life on earth, \" says nasa's chief technologist, dr. David miller. Now the agency is looking to go commercial with the technology so more rescue teams can access it, notes quartz, which flags other ways nasa has helped save lives: its technology has bolstered everything from firefighting gear to land mine removal methods. ( another incredible rescue story saw a 101-year-old saved in nepal. )",

        "summary": "Ariel castro has been found dead in his prison cell just 35 days into his life-plus-1,000-years sentence for keeping three women captive in his home for a decade. The 53-year-old hanged himself, say officials at the correctional reception center in orient, ohio. Prison officials found his body about 9: 20pm. They tried emergency life-saving measures, but he was pronounced dead at a hospital. Officials say castro was in protective custody — meaning he was in a cell by himself and was checked every 30 minutes — but he was not on suicide watch, the ap reports. Prison officials say a full investigation of the apparent suicide is under way, the cleveland plain dealer reports. Initial autopsy results confirm that he died of suicide by hanging, and sources tell abc 5 that he used a bed sheet to do it. But castro's lawyers aren't so sure. Asked about the suicide by the new york daily news, one replied, \" alleged suicide, right? \" another, lawyer craig weintraub, tells fox news latino that the prison twice denied requests for a psychological evaluation of castro. \" i ' m not so sure that they necessarily care if someone is suicidal, \" he said. On the today show, weintraub vowed \" to get to the bottom of it. I understand that the public is probably going to say good riddance. But this is a human being, we are in a civilized society, and we expect that the person would be protected when they're institutionalized. \"",

But usa today reports this jacked-up cousin of the regular bedbug has now apparently made a reappearance in the sunshine state, after a home in brevard county became overrun with the pests in 2015 ( so far the only confirmed case in the state ). Experts worry the insect has the potential to cause worse damage than its annoying relative. \" this species [ could ] develop more quickly, possibly cause an infestation problem sooner, and also could spread more rapidly, \" brittany campbell, a university of florida doctoral student who headed a study on the bug published in the florida entomologist journal in september, says in a release. The last time the insect had been spotted in florida was in the 1940s, per the entomology today website. Campbell says when she and her colleagues were sent a sample last year from the merritt island family whose house had been infested, they noticed it had a pronotum, or neck region, that was shaped differently than the garden-variety bedbug, which led to its discovery. The homeowners told the researchers they hadn't traveled outside of the state, meaning the insect likely had to be local or from another part of florida. As for how the bugs got back to florida, campbell speculates they may have arrived via brevard county's port canaveral. The release notes tropical bedbugs can cause similar health problems as regular bedbugs, including anxiety, depression, insomnia, itchy blisters, and ( naturally ) fear.

        "summary": "Four hundred jewish boys, including noah lederman's great-grandfather, were ordered to bury 12,000 jews murdered by the nazis while imprisoned at a forced labor camp in poland during world war ii. But until recently, the camp was \" nonexistent \" on paper. That's now changed with the creation of the holocaust museum's encyclopedia of military brothels, ghettos, pow camps, forced labor camps, and concentration camps where nazis exploited or murdered their victims, lederman writes in the jewish star. In 2000, archaeologists, historians, and relatives of survivors and perpetrators set out to document an estimated 5,000 sites. The tally now sits at 42,500 and \" quite frankly, you could put it much higher than that, \" the project leader tells the times of israel. To gain entry in the collection, a site required multiple witness testimonies and documents for confirmation. Researchers did not count brothels and sub-camps within a larger camp as separate entries. A 2013 new york times article noted that 30,000 slave labor camps and 980 concentration camps had been counted, though more were lost to history. Researcher hermann f. Weiss alone discovered six sites previously unknown. \" so many things about the holocaust might be unknown forever, \" weiss says. But \" i keep collecting. I keep looking. \" that means the number of sites could increase by the time the seventh volume of the encyclopedia is published in 2025. The first two volumes are available on amazon.

        "summary": "Some people work so hard to not have to work: such is the case of alan knight, a 47-year-old welsh man who conned $ 65,000 out of his neighbor, an 85-year-old pensioner with dementia. He then went to great lengths to avoid prosecution — claiming to be a quadriplegic and even pretending he was comatose. The telegraph reports authorities tried at least two times to haul him to court; in both instances, his condition suddenly grew more serious and he admitted himself to the hospital. Surveillance video proved to be his undoing: he was spotted walking normally at grocery stores ( police used his supermarket card to track him ) and filmed driving through a toll booth; nurses and doctors later saw him feeding himself, wiping his face, and writing, reports the bbc. Knight, whose 33-year-old wife pretended to care for him, was eventually told he'd stand trial regardless of his presence. So he showed up in a wheelchair and neck brace, and yesterday in court the father of three admitted to 19 charges of forgery, fraud, and theft; prosecutors alleged he \" systematically \" funneled the money out of his neighbor's accounts over the span of three years, reports the daily mail. \" although a very accomplished and determined actor, he is in nothing like the condition he claims to be, and the conditions he claims to be suffering from are simply non-existent, \" the judge said. Knight is in custody and will be sentenced next month. His neighbor has apparently been reimbursed by the bank. ( last year, a con man who pretended to be a rockefeller was found guilty of murder. )",

        "summary": "Foreign diplomats begin the tough work in vienna tomorrow of negotiating with iran on an agreement about its nuclear weapons program, possibly even bringing it to a grinding halt, the guardian reports. But while the obama administration has been working to jump-start the process — the president wrote a private letter to iran's ayatollah khamenei last month — he's got a queue of people who aren't sure if a deal should be pushed through, if at all, the new york times reports. On obama's side: the us, uk, germany, russia, and china, the guardian notes. Decidedly less in favor of a deal: israel's pm benjamin netanyahu — who has called iran an \" existential threat \" and said that \" it's an enemy of america \" — france ( which has set itself apart from other european nations by lobbying for stiffer negotiation terms ), and even the gop, the times notes. Sen. Lindsay graham, for instance, announced that the senate would fight a \" bad deal \" with iran, jns.org reports. Obama officials counter that by arguing he would never greenlight a deal that would put iran within a year of being able to make a bomb. Also in opposition are the saudis, who fear a deal could switch up american allegiances in the region to focus more on shiite iranians than on sunni saudis. The odds of reaching a deal are so-so: senior white house officials put the chances of an agreement this time around at 40 % to 50 %, notes the times. Some fear the results of failed negotiations, as israel has threatened military action if diplomacy fails, the guardian notes. \" in the words of the negotiators themselves: failure is not an option, \" says a former state department official.

And retailers liked it so much, expect to see a version of it — albeit smaller — today, as a record number of shoppers are expected to go online to snag cyber monday deals, which at some retailers, began sunday night. Black friday sales are estimated to have risen 6.6 percent from the same time last year, according to shoppertrak, a chicago-based company that tracks mall traffic. That estimated $ 11.4 billion in retail purchases represents the biggest dollar amount ever spent on that day. The national retail federation estimates 226 million shoppers visited stores and websites over the black friday weekend, up from 212 million last year. The survey, which interviewed more than 3,800 adults, reports that the average holiday shoppers spent $ 398.62 over the thanksgiving weekend, up from $ 365.34 last year. Conducted by bigresearch, the study also found that online spending was significant, with shoppers shelling out an average of $ 150.53 on the web, or 37.8 percent of their total weekend outlay.

Both sides say they're intent on avoiding another shutdown, and the new york times reports on how they ' ll do so: by lowering their expectations. That means no \" grand bargain. \" house budget committee chairman paul ryan met with his democratic counterpart in the senate, patty murray, for breakfast yesterday along with two other budget leaders; in total, there are 29 lawmakers on the budget conference committee, and a series of meetings are planned, the wall street journal reports. But aides didn't sound all that hopeful of finding a budget compromise both parties are happy with. The democratic budget for the year that began oct. 1 includes $ 1.058 trillion in spending; the republican budget is at $ 967 billion. The republican number factors in the next round of automatic sequester cuts, due to hit jan. 15, the washington post reports. But both parties want to avoid those cuts and instead replace them with savings elsewhere. But with expectations lowered, forget a deal on major items like tax revenues or entitlement programs: the main items on the bargaining table are reductions in things like farm subsidies, federal pensions, unemployment insurance, and the usps, plus small tax-loophole closings.",

( the washington post ) here are the key moments from the last day before the financial default deadline, when the senate and house came together to pass a deal to reopen the government. ( the washington post ) president obama and congressional leaders sought thursday to move beyond the cycle of crisis that has paralyzed washington for three years, initiating talks over the broad issues at the heart of their fight: the size of government and the level of federal taxation. Neither republicans nor democrats held out much hope that the talks would produce an ambitious deal to spur economic growth or tame the $ 16.7 trillion national debt. But senior republicans — whose party suffered in opinion polls after forcing the second-longest government shutdown in u.s. History — said they are unlikely to use that lever to challenge obama again. \"there's a country saying in kentucky: there's no education in the second kick of the mule, \" senate minority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky. ) said",

Dazzling \" heiress who redesigned the white house rose garden, has died at age 103 at her virginia home, the new york times reports. A friend to presidents and monarchs, mellon was heir to the listerine fortune; she was also known for her support for john edwards'scandal-plagued presidential campaign. As a childhood fascination with horticulture gave rise to a real, if untrained, talent, mellon — born rachel lowe lambert in princeton — was asked to redesign the white house rose garden by friend jacqueline kennedy in 1961. Dwight eisenhower had turned the garden into a putting green; in addition to the eponymous roses, mellon opted to surround a central lawn with american species including crab apple and thyme, as well as seasonal splashes of color. She also designed the east garden, receiving the conservation service award from the white house in 1966. In france, she designed hubert de givenchy's manor; in boston, the john f. Kennedy presidential library. Mellon was also an art patron; with husband paul mellon, son of former treasury secretary andrew mellon, she donated more than 1,000 items — among them works by van gogh, cezanne, and degas — to the national gallery, the washington post reports. But it was her gardens that defined her: \" mrs.

A first edition of lewis carroll's alice in wonderland will be sold by christie's on june 16 — almost exactly 151 years after it was first printed. The book's existence is actually quite remarkable: as fine books magazine explains, 2,000 copies were printed in 1865, but illustrator john tenniel was so unhappy with the printing of the pictures that he ordered every copy be returned and a fresh copy printed. The returned copies were to be \" sold as waste paper, \" carroll wrote in his diary. Yet 23 known copies survive — 18 of which are kept in public institutions, according to christie's. The available copy is expected to fetch $ 2 million to $ 3 million, \" making it presumably the most expensive waste paper that ever existed, \" per quartz. A carroll scholar says the edition is \" so choice \" that \" collectors would trade whole segments of their libraries for a single copy of the ' first ' alice; bibliographers dream of uncovering an unrecorded copy; and literary chroniclers are at a loss to explain how, even in the heyday of victorian publishing, such extravagant decisions could be made over a single children's book as were made over this one, \" per the guardian. Carroll, who lost the equivalent of $ 62,000 on the first edition, personally gave the copy to a colleague at oxford university — where he worked as a mathematician — who gave it to his daughter. It changed hands several times after her death in 1925 before making its way to its current owner, but it remains \" in its true original state, with the text and binding as they were when the book was first produced, \" christie's says.

Armed men, apparently pro-russia militants, loosely guarded the area but couldn't answer the monitors ' questions, he said. Bociurkiw said the group only stayed about 75 minutes and examined about 200 meters at the scene before being forced to leave. Pieces of the airplane and bodies are spread over several kilometers. The osce team arrived at the crash site near torez in a remote section of eastern ukraine that's controlled by pro-russian militants battling the ukraine government.

The country has settled on the broad strokes of a plan with the us that would see the two countries come together to create an isis-free zone, with the us supplying warplanes and turkey contributing troops who wouldn't actually enter the zone but may use long-range artillery from their side of the border. That zone would stretch along 68 miles of the syria-turkey border, reports the washington post; the guardian notes the countries share a 500-mile-long border. Syrian sources suggest the zone could stretch 25 miles into syria. An unnamed senior us official, one of four the new york times spoke with, says the intention is to \" support partners on the ground in northern syria \" — elsewhere referred to in the times article as \" relatively moderate syrian insurgents \" — who would seize the zone from the ground. There are a few sticky points: which syrian rebels will participate?

In fact, they may be more sensitive to it than adults, according to a post at science daily. Oxford scientists used mri scans to study the brains of newborns and found that they lit up in much the same way that adult brains do when exposed to pain. In the study, they mildly poked the babies ' feet while they were sleeping, and they poked the feet of adults for comparison. In the resulting brain scans, 18 of the 20 regions that lit up in the grown-ups lit up in the infants as well. What's more, the babies had the same reaction to a mild poke that adults did to a poke that was four times stronger, suggesting that the wee ones have less of a tolerance for pain, reports healthday. \"the infant's brain is much more developed than i was expecting, \" says lead researcher rebeccah slater, as quoted at time. Slater and her team say the perception that babies don't have fully developed pain receptors is still evident in modern medicine, as reflected in an earlier study showing that 60 % of babies undergoing presumably painful procedures during intensive care receive no pain medication. The scientists say that further research should refine ways to measure pain in infants and that, in the meantime, doctors should consider giving pain medication to babies for procedures that require it in older children.

Researchers analyzed dna from the soft tissue of a young male mammoth that lived 44,800 years ago in siberia, plus that from a 4,300-year-old molar from a male mammoth on wrangel island. Though the two dna copies from the siberian mammoth — one from the mother's side, one from the father's side — showed strong genetic variation, the wrangel island mammoth's genetic diversity was much lower. In fact, its parents were probably related and the mammoth population quite small. The research doesn't prove low genetic diversity will push an animal to extinction or that it did in the case of the woolly mammoth, but an evolutionary biologist compares a genome to a \" tool kit for getting out of trouble. \" greater genetic variation means a species has more tools to fight off disease or environmental changes. \" if you don't have the diversity, it's a challenge. \" ( oil workers recently pulled up a mammoth tusk. )",

            "Climate central, of princeton, n.j., was started in 2008 with foundation money to conduct original climate research and also to inform the public about the work of other scientists. For the sea level project, financed entirely by foundations, the group is using the internet to publish an extensive package of material that goes beyond the scientific papers, specifying risks by community. People can search by zip code to get some idea of their own exposure. While some coastal governments have previously assessed their risk, most have not, and national-level analyses have also been rare. The new package of material may therefore give some communities and some citizens their first solid sense of the threat. Dr. Strauss said he hoped this would spur fresh efforts to prepare for the ocean's rise, and help make the public more aware of the risks society is running by pumping greenhouse gases into the air. Scientists say those gases are causing the planet to warm and its land ice to melt into the sea. The sea itself is absorbing most of the extra heat, which causes the water to expand and thus contributes to the rise. The ocean has been rising slowly and relentlessly since the late 19th century, one of the hallmark indicators that the climate of the earth is changing. The average global rise has been about eight inches since 1880"

Asked about the new information, a twitter spokesperson simply pointed to the company's initial statement ( which blamed a \" customer support employee \" on his or her last day at work ) and said a full internal investigation is underway. The times notes that the issue highlights a potential problem for twitter and other social media companies, which often outsource \" sensitive work \" to third-party contract workers; twitter employees have expressed concerns that these workers can do things like disable accounts, though the employees say contractors cannot tweet from a user's account or access a person's direct messages. In fact, employees tell the verge this isn't the first time a departing worker has pulled a stunt like this. \" people have 'dropped the mic ' in the past and deleted accounts, verified users, and otherwise abused their power on the last day, \" says one employee, noting that none of those incidents became public. Multiple news outlets are expressing concern over twitter security after the trump incident, and security experts echo those concerns to the guardian. One expert says the only surefire way to keep something like this from happening again is to always have two social media employees monitoring each other's actions. According to twitter, though, steps have already been taken, fox news reports. \" we have implemented safeguards to prevent this from happening again, \" the company tweeted. \" we won't be able to share all details about our internal investigation or updates to our security measures, but we take this seriously and our teams are on it. \"",

An onshore team will use metal detectors to look for \" signs of an initial survival camp, \" zeroing in on eight locations that were determined to possibly be the site of man-made objects per 1938 aerial photos. Lead archaeologist thomas king tells the marianas variety that a botanical survey will seek to determine what earhart could have eaten.

        "summary": "Two familiar phrases are back in the news this week, and this time they're related: \" government shutdown \" and \" border wall. \" congress has until friday to pass a budget and avoid a government shutdown, and one big sticking point is the white house's renewed push for money for president trump's promised wall on the mexican border. Here's a look at what's happening on the shutdown front: first things first: nbc news reports that it's likely congress will punt by passing a short-term spending bill that will give them a week or two to hammer out a longer-term deal. The wall is suddenly a big priority again: the white house is pressuring congressional republicans to insist on money for it in any spending plan, reports the washington post. But democrats remain adamant against the idea, and republicans such as marco rubio say they don't think the issue is worth a shutdown. The white house has offered democrats a deal: $ 1 in crucial obamacare subsidies for every $ 1 in border wall money, reports politico. Senate minority leader chuck schumer likened it to a \" hostage \" deal and called the proposal a nonstarter. Trump himself is weighing in: \" the democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad ms 13 gang members, \" he tweeted. A post at the american spectator thinks a shutdown would work in trump's favor. In previous shutdowns, presidents clinton and obama picked which programs would get shut down with the goal of making republicans look bad. \" but when trump gets to pick what gets cut, it ' ll be a different story — one of the'swamp ' vs. Trump, and he ' ll win that one. \" but a shutdown would come just ahead of trump's 100th day in office on saturday, with his party in control of both houses of congress. Forcing a shutdown over the border wall, which doesn't have widespread public support, would be \" really masochistic, \" an american university prof tells newsweek. Another sticking point in talks: lawmakers from big coal states want a long-term fix to a dispute over health benefits for retired miners, reports the new york times.",

Kim, a former state department contractor, leaked classified information about north korea to fox news in an effort to bring attention to the danger that country poses, he was given a 13-month sentence. Yet david petraeus gave his journals, which contained top-secret notes, to the lover writing a book about him, and the now-retired general will not be given jail time. A lawyer for kim points out that \" profound double standard \" in a letter to the justice department calling for kim's immediate release, the new york times reports. And, as the times notes, there are other examples of the discrepancy in sentences handed out to high-level officials like petraeus versus those handed out to lower-level officials or contractors. For instance: former cia officer john c. Kiriakou served almost two years for disclosing the name of a fellow officer involved in the cia's interrogation program to a journalist. Petraeus, then-cia director, released a statement on the incident noting that \" oaths do matter \" — a month before his own disclosures were revealed. Former cia officer jeffrey sterling faces years in prison for allegedly leaking information to the times about a secret mission, though he says he's innocent. ( one of his lawyers tells yahoo news the defense team will cite petraeus ' case during sterling's sentencing next month. ) but the investigation into alleged leaks by retired gen. James e. Cartwright has stalled. The letter also notes that leon panetta wasn't punished even though he allegedly leaked the name of the seal who led the osama bin laden raid, the intercept reports. \" if you're high enough up, you play by different rules, \" says a former nsa officer whose own illegal disclosures cost him his retirement benefits and a lot of money. Petraeus, meanwhile, makes a good living running a private equity firm, speaking on national security issues, and even advising the white house.

In a speech that urged americans to bridge political differences and embrace change as a force for good, obama repeatedly hit the gop — overtly and obliquely — for preying on people's fears, whether about immigrants, muslims or the economy. And, amid a bitter 2016 presidential campaign, obama's implied political message was clear: unless a democrat succeeds him, the progress made during his two terms could be reversed. Story continued below \"there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening america under control. And each time, we overcame those fears, \" obama said in a veiled reference to trump, the gop poll leader. \"we did not, in the words of lincoln, adhere to the 'dogmas of the quiet past.

Opinions are sharply divided on the surprise firing and the reasons for it, though both sides tend to agree that comey handled the hillary clinton email investigation very poorly. A roundup of opinions: this is a \" perilous moment \" for the us, according to the new york times editorial board, which says that while comey certainly bungled the clinton investigation, it's clear that trump fired him for other reasons. \" the president of the united states, who is no more above the law than any other citizen, has now decisively crippled the fbi's ability to carry out an investigation of him and his associates, \" the board warns. Comey had to go because he \" made law enforcement decisions that probably influenced the outcome of the presidential election, a terrible precedent for our democracy, \" writes john yoo at fox news, praising trump for making a \" tough call \" and urging democrats to support the move. \" what trump is doing here is not simply unpredictable. It is potentially very dangerous, \" writes chris cillizza at cnn. \" removing the person charged with overseeing an investigation into a foreign country attempting to influence us elections by hurting one candidate ( clinton ) and helping another ( trump ) sends a chilling message up and down the federal bureaucracy — not to mention the populace. \" the wall street journal editorial board says comey deserved to be fired and the agency deserves a fresh start. \" a new fbi director who looks at the russia evidence with fresh eyes and without the political baggage of the last year will have a better chance of being credible to the american people, \" they write. At the new republic, brian beutler calls this a \" moment of truth \" for us democracy. If this is not a \" calamitously ham-fisted attempt to obstruct the russia-trump investigation, \" he writes, there needs to be a special prosecutor appointed to handle the russia probe and trump needs to nominate a nonpartisan replacement for comey. Ruth marcus at the washington post is no comey fan — she says she would probably have fired him herself, given the chance — but she finds trump's timing and rationale very fishy. \" trump's priority is, first and always, trump, \" she writes. \" which raises the question: knowing, as he must have, that firing comey would set off a firestorm, why did he calculate that this",

Building materials, fishing nets, and barrels of potentially hazardous materials are expected, but officials say bodies are not expected, and radioactive material is unlikely. \" we expect there to be an upswing in debris on the shore, \" say an official with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. \" the interesting thing is, we don't know where it's going to be, and we think it is going to be spread out. \" on its advice page, the agency says volunteers cleaning up marine debris should follow common sense and put safety first, and be especially careful around containers of chemicals, which should be reported to authorities instead of handled. Personal items that could be identified should be reported to the noaa, which will work with japanese authorities to return them to their owners.",

        "summary": "The nipah virus has now killed at least a dozen people in southern india and health workers fear it could become a global epidemic if it isn't tightly monitored. More than 40 other people have been infected with the virus, which has a mortality rate of around 75 %, fox news reports. Health officials believe the outbreak in kerala state began with an infected fruit bat, with later infections coming from human-to-human contact. There's no known cure or vaccine for nipah, which causes symptoms including fever, vomiting, and convulsions. To avoid being infected by fruit bats, citizens have been urged to ignore fallen fruit on the ground, especially if it has claw or tooth marks. Previous outbreaks of nipah were recorded in west bengal and bangladesh, more than a thousand miles away from the current outbreak. Experts aren't sure how it ended up in kerala, especially since no cases have been detected elsewhere in southern india and even migratory bats don't travel that far. Some experts believe it was spread through infected figs and dates, while others say pressures on fruit bat populations may have activated the virus. \" this is why it is so important to find the source of this outbreak, \" a medical officer tells firstpost. \" only if we answer the question of how the virus came to this part of the world can we put in place scientific measures to ensure that such an outbreak does not happen anywhere close by again.

            "It has now been close to a week since the dreaded nipah virus outbreak hit kozhikode in north kerala. The state government would like the rest of the world to believe that its efforts to contain the virus to as small an area as possible have been successful. To a large extent, that claim does have merit. Even though one more person died on saturday afternoon, the death was reported from kozhikode itself. But more attention needs to be given to the question as to how the virus outbreak happened in this part of the world. This is an issue which baffles health experts. It is unclear how the virus landed up in kozhikode, which is close to three thousand kilometers away from siliguri in west bengal, where the last such outbreak was reported way back in 2001. Bangladesh, which saw several nipah cases till 2017, is also a huge distance away from kozhikode. Health officials have been burning the midnight oil to ensure that the outbreak is contained. In a matter of further worry for them, test results from the national institute of high security animal diseases ( nishad ), bhopal came in. These results were from samples of the bats found in the well of a house in perambra which is believed to be the epicentre of the outbreak. The nipah virus was not found in these samples. However",
            "More than a dozen people have died after an outbreak of a rare disease in southern india that health officials warn could cause a global epidemic. Health officials have imposed emergency measures in the southwestern state of kerala after the more than 40 people were infected with the nipah virus, which causes flu-like symptoms leading to an agonizing brain-swelling condition known as encephalitis, according to sky news. There is no vaccine for nipah, which has a mortality rate of 70 percent, and no treatment beyond supportive care to make patients comfortable. The virus is listed alongside ebola and zika as one of eight priority diseases the world health organization believes could cause a global epidemic. Health officials believe this outbreak began with someone infected by a fruit bat, a senior health ministry official told the press trust of india news agency. Subsequent infections are believed to have come from human-to-human contact, sometimes passing to relatives or medical workers caring for the sick. About 100 families where someone has had contact with infected people are being carefully monitored by health officials. Rare bat virus kills at least 10 in india as officials scramble to control outbreak tests have also been ordered after several bats were found dead at a secondary school in the state of himachal pradesh, according to sky news.

            "It has now been close to a week since the dreaded nipah virus outbreak hit kozhikode in north kerala. The state government would like the rest of the world to believe that its efforts to contain the virus to as small an area as possible have been successful. To a large extent, that claim does have merit. Even though one more person died on saturday afternoon, the death was reported from kozhikode itself. But more attention needs to be given to the question as to how the virus outbreak happened in this part of the world. This is an issue which baffles health experts. It is unclear how the virus landed up in kozhikode, which is close to three thousand kilometers away from siliguri in west bengal, where the last such outbreak was reported way back in 2001. Bangladesh, which saw several nipah cases till 2017, is also a huge distance away from kozhikode. Health officials have been burning the midnight oil to ensure that the outbreak is contained. In a matter of further worry for them, test results from the national institute of high security animal diseases ( nishad ), bhopal came in. These results were from samples of the bats found in the well of a house in perambra which is believed to be the epicentre of the outbreak. The nipah virus was not found in these samples. However",
            "More than a dozen people have died after an outbreak of a rare disease in southern india that health officials warn could cause a global epidemic. Health officials have imposed emergency measures in the southwestern state of kerala after the more than 40 people were infected with the nipah virus, which causes flu-like symptoms leading to an agonizing brain-swelling condition known as encephalitis, according to sky news. There is no vaccine for nipah, which has a mortality rate of 70 percent, and no treatment beyond supportive care to make patients comfortable. The virus is listed alongside ebola and zika as one of eight priority diseases the world health organization believes could cause a global epidemic. Health officials believe this outbreak began with someone infected by a fruit bat, a senior health ministry official told the press trust of india news agency. Subsequent infections are believed to have come from human-to-human contact, sometimes passing to relatives or medical workers caring for the sick. About 100 families where someone has had contact with infected people are being carefully monitored by health officials. Rare bat virus kills at least 10 in india as officials scramble to control outbreak tests have also been ordered after several bats were found dead at a secondary school in the state of himachal pradesh, according to sky news. The examinations later found the bats were not carrying nipah, but fear continues to"

But the new york city firefighter, who helped with ground zero cleanup after 9/11, died in march of cancer related to the world trade center attacks before he could do so. Young, who was known as the \" firehouse chef \" and who was also a two-time champion of chopped on the food network, also lost his wife to breast cancer in 2012. But on sunday, in an episode that had been taped in june, the couple's three children kept their father's dream alive. Kaley, 25, christian, 19, and keira, 15, presented the cup board pro — bearing the insignia of the 9/11 firefighters who died — and it was a big success. All five sharks came together to jointly offer the trio $ 100,000 for a 20 % stake in the business, in what usa today calls a \" rare \" move. They also promised that any profits they made from their 20 % would go toward keith young's charity of choice for firefighters who got sick after 9/11, newsday reports. The siblings, who've been running their cup board pro business out of their living room, also sold out of the cutting boards on their online store after the show aired. \" our dad would probably be so proud of us and, like, so happy that we're continuing on his legacy, his dream, \" keira said. Added kaley during the segment, \" it's kind of hard to overwhelm the three of us, because of the amount of stress you go through seeing a loved one sick. We're only able to be here because of how strong our parents were. \" ( this man sought revenge for his brother's 9/11 death — but then he had a change of heart. )",

The report also indicates that the syrian people have been besieged by crimes against humanity at the hands of both assad loyalists and isis militants in what the commission is calling a \" continuation — and a geographic expansion — of the widespread and systematic attack on the civilian population. \" over nearly two weeks in april, witnesses say copters flew over at least three syrian villages and dropped \" barrel bombs \" that reeked of chlorine when they burst, the report notes via the afp. Residents affected by the bombs experienced \" symptoms compatible with exposure to chemical agents, namely vomiting, eye and skin irritation, choking, and other respiratory problems. \" although chlorine technically doesn't fall under the umbrella of chemical weapons that syria is supposed to destroy under the chemical weapons convention, \" use of any chemical agent for military purposes is a war crime, \" the un panel says, according to the new york times. Meanwhile, the commission blasted isis — which brutally executed james foley — as responsible for \" executions, amputations, and lashings in public squares, \" as well as \" terrorizing the local population \" across northern iraq and eastern syria, says the afp.",

All looked normal on thailand's military radar until 1: 22am, when flight 370 vanished.

Due to radar limitations, the signal was later lost. The malaysian air force earlier stated its radar tracked the plane over the strait of malacca; the bbc notes the thai military earlier said it picked up no sign of the plane.

The idea for a strike began germinating after the newspaper published a scathing exposé on export-farm labor abuses in december. Among the farmhands'demands, according to an organizer's statement cited by the ap: overtime pay, benefits, medical care, and an end to sexual harassment, as well as increasing wages that often hover at less than $ 8 a day. Some of these companies'supporters say wages in this part of the country are higher than in other mexican regions, and the businesses themselves refute alleged mistreatment. \" our primary focus continues to be toward the well-being of our employees, \" a statement from the us-based berrymex says. But tensions are growing, with witnesses telling the times that rocks, tear gas, and rubber bullets have flown back and forth between protesters and police; one group of demonstrators even stopped a bus and made passengers stay the night in a church.
