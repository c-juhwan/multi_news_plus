        "summary": "In a stunt arranged by wired, two \" security researchers \" hacked their way into a jeep cherokee carrying writer andy greenberg in st. Louis and, from a basement 10 miles away, took over the vehicle and steered it into a ditch. And it's not a one-off. Charlie miller and chris valasek say they've spent the past two years hacking away at a variety of cars, and that they plan to reveal at the annual black hat and def con hacking conferences the fact that hundreds of thousands of vehicles are vulnerable. \" i have done a lot of research, but this is the first time i've been truly freaked out, \" miller tells the new york times. \" when i could hack into a car in nebraska driving down the freeway, i had that feeling, ' i shouldn't be able to do this. ' \" in response, chrysler — maker of the cherokee, deemed the most hackable model — has quietly issued a free software update to fix the vulnerability, reports pc magazine. \" all of this is possible only because chrysler, like practically all carmakers, is doing its best to turn the modern automobile into a smartphone, \" writes greenberg; the access point here is an internet-connected feature called uconnect. Self-described \" digital crash-test dummy \" greenberg found himself subject to a blast of cold air, skee-lo blaring at full volume, windshield wipers swooshing at full throttle, an image of the hackers in their track suits, and, when the brakes failed, greenberg slid into a ditch. The hackers spent nine months sharing their findings with chrysler, which \" appreciates \" their work but is leery of any \" how-to \" disclosures. Product recalls and civil lawsuits may be on the horizon, one expert says. ( this hacker is doing similar work on airplanes. )",

The duo recently demonstrated how they can leverage the flaw to remotely hack into a jeep, taking wired writer andy greenberg on a ride he won't soon forget. Greenberg agreed to be the researcher's \" digital crash-test dummy \" and willingly got behind the wheel of a jeep cherokee on public roads in st. Louis.

        "summary": "The biggest flying bird ever discovered had a wingspan bigger than that of some small planes — and appropriately enough, its fossil was found at an airport. The bird, named pelagornis sandersi, lived around 25 million years ago and had a wingspan of up to 24 feet across, around twice that of the wandering albatross, the biggest flying bird around today. Its bones were unearthed decades ago by construction workers at charleston international airport, but they ended up hidden in a drawer in a museum and their significance was not realized until recently, reports the los angeles times. With its huge wings and mouth full of bony spikes, \" this was a remarkable fossil, almost like something out of game of thrones, \" daniel ksepka, the paleontologist who identified the species, tells the guardian. The huge bird could glide for long distances as it searched the oceans for food, says ksepka, whose find is a lot bigger than what researchers had previously believed to be the upper limit possible for birds capable of flight, slate notes. But those calculations are based on the energy required for a bird to flap its wings, and ksepka believes pelagornis used different strategies. \" they could harvest energy from the environment, like taking advantage of wind gusts, \" says the paleontologist, who plans more research to discover \" how they launched and landed, and how maneuverable they were. \" ( in another recent find, a stegomastodon skull was unearthed in new mexico last month — by a bachelor party. )",

The company is said to be working on a stand-alone app that would allow users to interact without having to provide their real names, say sources who ( fittingly ) spoke on condition of anonymity to the new york times. The app, said to be scheduled for release over the next few weeks, is ostensibly designed to assure users they can comfortably discuss sensitive topics — perhaps health care or other subjects \" in which not using one's real name is beneficial, \" the sources say. The team has reportedly been experimenting with different incarnations of the app for the past year or so; it's unclear if and how the app would sync up with a user's main facebook account. Mark zuckerberg has given signs before that facebook may be willing to venture into anonymous territory, including introducing an anonymous login feature in april that limits what info users let third-party apps see, reuters reported. The times notes, however, that no one's sure yet how facebook will keep the trolls in check — a problem even the company's chief product officer acknowledged in a facebook post last week. \" the stories of mass impersonation, trolling, domestic abuse, and higher rates of bullying and intolerance are oftentimes the result of people hiding behind fake names, and it's both terrifying and sad, \" he wrote.

San francisco facebook introduced new features on wednesday that let users limit how much personal information they share with third-party mobile apps, a move meant to quell privacy concerns as the social network seeks to become a top entry port to the internet. In recent years, facebook inc has successfully encouraged a growing number of third-party app makers to allow users to log in with their facebook identity rather than, say, by entering an email address or creating a dedicated account. The result has been an influx of valuable data for the world's no. 1 social network, but concerns have also mounted about third-party developers gaining access to private information. Chief executive mark zuckerberg said at facebook's developer conference in san francisco on wednesday that a new version of facebook's log-in tool, called \" log in anonymously, \" would let users control what information they allow third-party apps to see. He told developers the tool would let users feel more comfortable about logging into apps using facebook. \" by giving people more power and control, they're going to trust all the apps that we build more, and over time use them more. And that's positive for everyone, \" said zuckerberg.

        "summary": "Obamacare just became very real for some trader joe's employees. Part-timers who work fewer than 30 hours a week will no longer be covered by the company plan starting next year — instead, they will pick their insurance policy from the exchanges being created under the affordable care act, reports the huffington post. The company, which has a sterling reputation in terms of the benefits it offers its part-time staff, will provide each worker with a $ 500 stipend. Between that \" and the tax credits available under the aca, many of you should be able to obtain health care coverage at very little if any net cost to you, \" says the company memo, obtained by huffpo. The story includes quotes from one affected worker understandably anxious over the move, and both critics and supporters of obamacare are starting to weigh in. On the right, john nolte at breitbart writes that it's a sign employers are afraid their health care costs will \" explode \" under obamacare and are looking to cut benefits. But at think progress, sy mukherjee argues that the \" decision isn't an indictment of the health law at all. In fact, it's a definitive sign that obamacare is working as intended. \" we're finally on our way toward a \" workable insurance market \" for all the working poor, not just those lucky enough to work for conscientious companies, he writes. And based on current data, he thinks the affected tj's workers might end up saving some money each month. ( similarly, ibm recently announced it would shift retirees to a health-insurance exchange. )",

The old zion curtain law forced restaurants to erect partitions to block customers from seeing their drinks being poured or mixed and to protect children from seeing how cool bartending is. In heavily mormon utah, even restaurants that only served beer had to put up barriers, according to smithsonian. Restaurants complained that such barriers were unsightly and didn't even prevent children from seeing alcohol being consumed, the ap reports. Restaurant owner joel lasalle tells npr the law \" probably cost us $ 350,000 in sales \" over the past two years because \" people didn't want to... Face a frosted glass wall instead of a bartender. \" lasalle's was one of the first restaurants to have their partition removed, smashing the frosted glass and celebrating what he calls a \" hallelujah moment \" with champagne. The salt lake tribune reports dozens more restaurants are in the process of having their barriers removed — pending approval by the state. Restaurants now have a choice: stick with the zion curtain partition, keep minors 10 feet away from where liquor is poured, or erect a partial wall or railing separating the dining area and bar area. But it's not all good news for utah's drinkers. The new law also increases the markup on liquor, wine, and some beers by about 2 %.

More than two dozen restaurants across the state rushed to tear down their much-maligned \" zion curtain \" barriers saturday, the same day a new law took effect that loosened utah's controversial liquor-dispensing requirement. As of midday friday, 26 restaurants had been inspected and approved by the utah department of alcoholic beverage control to be barrier-free, said spokesman terry wood. Stoneground kitchen, current fish and oyster, and rye diner and drinks, all in salt lake city, as well as bandits grill and bar in cottonwood heights, were among the first to tear down the barriers, wood said. Current had its glass zion curtain down — and shattered — by midmorning. Immediately afterward, owner joel lasalle and general manager andrew cliburn celebrated with a toast of champagne."

Captain francesco schettino said it was an accident that he left the costa concordia, according to italian press reports. \" the passengers were pouring on to the decks, taking the lifeboats by assault, \" he was quoted as telling a judge during a hearing to determine whether he should be held in custody on charges of manslaughter and abandoning ship. \" i was trying to get people to get into the boats in an orderly fashion.

The biggest miss was in 1980, when late polls showed ronald reagan with a 2- or 3-point lead; he ended up trouncing jimmy carter by 10 points. But that election was made unusually volatile by a single, late-in-the-cycle debate that didn't have time to register in polling and the presence of a third-party candidate, silver says. In the 10 elections since 1972, polls have \" overestimated \" dems ' edge five times, the gop four times, and nailed barack obama's margin of victory on the head. Accusations of partisanship, concludes silver, are most likely \" wishful thinking. \" click for silver's full column, or take a look at a few of the latest polls out there: in ohio, obama has opened up a 51 % to 42 % lead over romney, reports the columbus dispatch. In iowa, the incumbent is leading romney by 49 % to 45 %, according to a poll out yesterday by the des moines register. But with widespread disapproval over obama's economic stewardship, romney has an opening. In massachusetts, elizabeth warren has opened up a 43 % to 38 % lead over scott brown in their closely contested senate race, according to a boston globe poll.

The idea \" that republican jurisprudence would be defined by aggressive economic judicial activism \" would have seemed far-fetched not too long ago. \" but just as there are few atheists in foxholes, there aren't a lot of justices of any persuasion willing to walk away from a chance to overturn a duly-passed law that they personally detest.

Apparently, there's a beetle that escapes certain death in the belly of a toad by shooting a toxic, 212-degree chemical mix from its butt, causing the toad to vomit, gizmodo reports. This stunning example of nature's grossness comes courtesy of a study published wednesday in biology letters. Back in 2016, researchers in japan fed a bombardier beetle to a toad to see what would happen. The result was shocking: the toad puked up the beetle 44 minutes after eating it, and the would-be meal walked away fine. The follow-up study published this week explains how that happened. Bombardier beetles produce chemicals in their guts, including hydrogen peroxide and compounds that damage tissue, that they can use to ward off predators. They also have a hard shell to protect them from stomach acid for hours. Researchers found 43 % of toads puked up the beetles 12 to 107 minutes after eating them. \" an explosion was audible inside each toad, which indicated that p. Jessoensis ejected chemical spray after being swallowed, \" afp quotes the study as saying. Fifteen of the beetles vomited up went on to live for at least two weeks; a 16th lived more than 18 months. ( the toads were also fine after puking. ) researchers found smaller toads vomited up the beetles more frequently and larger beetles had a better chance at survival, showing \" the importance of the prey-predator size relationship. \" ( meanwhile, indian frogs have discovered a gross new way to have sex. )",

The company's stock price has plunged around 80 %. Knight is one of the leading market makers responsible for keeping transactions flowing smoothly on wall street. Some sec officials are now calling for new regulations, protective mechanisms, and testing requirements for trading software, the new york times reports, and they're getting less pushback than usual.

But the difference between aj vandermeyden, who's just lodged a lawsuit against elon musk's electric-car giant for \" pervasive harassment, \" and susan fowler, who wrote a recent scathing uber takedown on that company's alleged sexism, is that vandermeyden is publicizing her complaint while she's still working at her company, the guardian reports. The reason the engineer is filing a complaint rather than simply leaving to work elsewhere is that she calls herself a tesla fan — \" i really do believe they are doing great things \" — and that she'd rather stay and fight against what's \" fundamentally wrong \" to retain what's right at the \" revolutionary \" company. In addition to the \" inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls \" her suit says she's endured, vandermeyden claims she and other women have lost out on promotions to less-qualified men, that she was paid less than males doing similar work, and that she was punished for being a whistleblower for pointing out manufacturing defects. Plus, she alleges, when issues like these have been broached in the past, the standard response has been that the company is too busy with carmaking to handle complaints. An anonymous employee who spoke to mashable added tesla's culture is one \" of fear, \" while a bloomberg story from early february reported on news from an alleged tesla worker who claimed employees are trying to form a union at its plant in fremont, calif.

It might be hard to top the one being tested in tanzania as a way to prevent malaria: smelly socks. Experiments in three villages where people get about 350 bites a year from malaria-infected mosquitoes are using dirty socks to lure the insects into traps, where they become contaminated with poisons and ultimately die. Researchers hope that if the strategy works, it will eventually complement insecticide-treated bed nets as a low-tech way to prevent malaria, which kills nearly 900,000 people a year worldwide, most of them children. \"it's a bold idea. Who would have thought there was a life-saving technology working in your laundry basket? \" said peter a. Singer, a physician who heads grand challenges canada, a development agency of the canadian government that is helping fund the research. Previous lab studies have shown that smelly socks work well in attracting mosquitoes. Field experiments have shown that synthetic bait is more attractive than people, at least until the insects get close enough to realize there's no blood waiting for them. The new experiments, however, are the first head-to-head field tests of footwear vs. Chemistry. The researchers hope the footwear wins. \"it is simply a cost issue and an expediency issue, \" said fredros o. Okumu",

And scientists fighting malaria may soon be wafting that odor of stinky socks over poor villages throughout africa as a potent anti-malarial weapon, thanks to a canadian foreign aid grant, according to healthzone.ca. Mosquitoes, including the malaria-carrying anopheles, choose their targets for blood entirely on their sense of smell. And the mosquitoes find the smell of sweaty socks irresistible. So worn socks will be employed as bait in traps that can kill thousands of the malaria-bearing parasites each night, said the tanzanian scientist who invented the device. \"we bait them indeed with dirty socks, \" said fredros okumu, 29, a research scientist with the ifakara health institute in southeastern tanzania. Okumu is leading the two-year project funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation and grant challenges canada. \"the sock is attractive to us, not just because it's attractive to mosquitoes, but also because it's readily available, \" said okumu, who is completing a phd at the london school of hygiene &amp; tropical medicine.

Researchers hope that if the strategy works, it will eventually complement insecticide-treated bed nets as a low-tech way to prevent malaria, which kills nearly 900,000 people a year worldwide, most of them children. \"it's a bold idea. Who would have thought there was a life-saving technology working in your laundry basket? \" said peter a. Singer, a physician who heads grand challenges canada, a development agency of the canadian government that is helping fund the research. Previous lab studies have shown that smelly socks work well in attracting mosquitoes. Field experiments have shown that synthetic bait is more attractive than people, at least until the insects get close enough to realize there's no blood waiting for them. The new experiments, however, are the first head-to-head field tests of footwear vs. Chemistry. The researchers hope the footwear wins. \"it is simply a cost issue and an expediency issue, \" said fredros o. Okumu",
            "Scientist have discovered the most advanced mosquito repellent. Dirty socks. The smell of sweaty socks signals \"feast \" to the blood-sucking insects. And scientists fighting malaria may soon be wafting that odor of stinky socks over poor villages throughout africa as a potent anti-malarial weapon, thanks to a canadian foreign aid grant, according to healthzone.ca. Mosquitoes, including the malaria-carrying anopheles, choose their targets for blood entirely on their sense of smell. And the mosquitoes find the smell of sweaty socks irresistible. So worn socks will be employed as bait in traps that can kill thousands of the malaria-bearing parasites each night, said the tanzanian scientist who invented the device. \"we bait them indeed with dirty socks, \" said fredros okumu, 29, a research scientist with the ifakara health institute in southeastern tanzania. Okumu is leading the two-year project funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation and grant challenges canada. \"the sock is attractive to us, not just because it's attractive to mosquitoes, but also because it's readily available, \" said okumu, who is completing a phd at the london school of hygiene &amp; tropical medicine. Okumu has also used simple cotton pads worn for a day in villagers'shoes as an alternative to the actual sock. \"if you're using socks, you're going to have to get"

        "summary": "Anencephaly is a \" uniformly fatal \" birth defect that leaves babies born without part of their brain or skull — and it's been striking three counties in rural washington state at a rate at least four times the national average. But the cluster — in yakima, franklin, and benton counties — remains cloaked in mystery, with no single cause pinpointed. The state's health department and the cdc in july issued a report that cited 23 cases of anencephaly between january 2010 and january 2013. A genetic counselor has since seen eight or nine more cases of it and spina bifida, nbc news reports. Officials were first alerted by a 58-year-old nurse who had seen no more than two cases of anencephaly in her decades-long career — and then experienced two cases in a six-month span, and learned of a third. Officials dug into the cases of the women involved, and found \" no common exposures, conditions, or causes \" — having reviewed everything from their education and bmi to their water supply to any medications they took, the yakima herald republic noted at the time. But some are faulting officials for not actually alerting the women that they were part of a perceived cluster, or actually interviewing them. Doing so could reveal \" common environmental exposures, \" says a duke genetics professor who specializes in anencephaly; she notes that research has shown a correlation between the defect and mold and pesticide exposure, and that the central washington area is an agriculture-heavy one. The seattle times previously reported on other potential risk factors: a diet lacking in folic acid, a contaminant in cornmeal, and elevated nitrates levels in drinking water. Still, the cdc maintains it could just be a coincidence. A report on the number of cases recorded in 2013 is due this spring.",

And while shrimp are nutritious and delicious, farmed shrimp that hail from cleared southeast asian mangrove forests come with a carbon footprint 10 times larger than that of beef, tech insider reports, citing a 2012 study. Not to mention the fact that the ap recently found shrimp sold everywhere from whole foods to red lobster to walmart had been peeled by migrant slaves kept in warehouses in thailand and prevented from leaving.

The fake shrimp being grown in the new wave labs are no mere tofurky. \" we analyzed shrimp on a molecular level to figure out the components, \" barnes tells tech insider. They broke down red algae — the algae that shrimp eat that give them their flavor and color — and combined that with protein powder from plants. Barnes tells the atlantic the process is \" similar to baking a loaf of bread. \" tech insider's ariel schwartz, an avowed shrimp-lover, tasted new wave's breaded variety in february and found it \" had that springiness and mixture of crunch and chew that you'd expect from the real thing. \" it also has a similar nutritional value.

            "Chicago &#124; chicago ( reuters ) - new artificial \" skin \" fashioned out of flexible semiconductor materials can sense touch, making it possible to create robots with a grip delicate enough to hold an egg, yet strong enough to grasp the frying pan, u.s. Researchers said on sunday. Scientists have long struggled with a way to make robotic devices capable of adjusting the amount of force needed to hold and use different objects. The pressure-sensitive materials are designed to overcome that challenge. \" humans generally know how to hold a fragile egg without breaking it, \" said ali javey, an electrical engineer at the university of california berkeley, who led one of two teams reporting on artificial skin discoveries in the journal nature materials. \" if we ever wanted a robot that could unload the dishes, for instance, we'd want to make sure it doesn't break the wine glasses in the process. But we'd also want the robot to be able to grip a stock pot without dropping it, \" javey said in a statement. Javey's team found a way to make ultra tiny \" nanowires \" from an alloy of silicon and germanium. Wires of this material were formed on the outside of a cylindrical drum, which was then rolled onto a sticky film, depositing the wires in a uniform pattern. Sheets of this semiconductor film were then coated with a layer of pressure-sensitive rubber. Tests of the material showed it was able to detect a range of force, from typing on a keyboard to holding an object. A second team led by zhenan bao, a chemical engineer at stanford university in california, used a different approach, making a material so sensitive it can detect the weight of a butterfly resting on it. Bao's sensors were made by sandwiching a precisely molded, highly elastic rubber layer between two electrodes in a regular grid of tiny pyramids. \" we molded it into some kind of microstructure to incorporate some air pockets, \" bao said in a telephone interview. \" if we introduce air pockets, then these rubber pieces can bounce back. \" when this material is stretched, the artificial skin measures the change in electrical activity. \" the change in the thickness of the material is converted into an electrical signal, \" she said. Eventually, the teams hope artificial skin could be used to restore the sense of touch in people with prosthetic limbs, but scientists will first need a better understanding of how to integrate the system's sensors"

The sex and the city star has for weeks been rumored to be interested in the job, but new developments suggest there's merit to the rumors. She's met, for instance, with two former top advisers to new york city mayor bill de blasio who specialize in engaging the democratic left; nixon supported de blasio in the 2013 mayoral race, reports the new york times. She's also been seen out with a camera crew. But the \" best evidence yet \" of a possible run, according to the new york post, is that nixon's wife, christine marinoni, just left her job as a special adviser for community partnerships at nyc's department of education, a move that would allow her to campaign for nixon; she had held the $ 131,000-a-year job for nearly four years. If elected, the longtime education activist would be the first female and first openly gay governor of new york, per the guardian. It ' ll be a hard fight to get to that point, but some argue cuomo's airing of recent endorsements and a $ 100,000 tv ad show that he's already preparing for an intense democratic primary in september. Regardless, \" i ' m not nervous about whoever runs, \" cuomo said wednesday. A day later, he won the endorsement of the new york chapter of the national organization for women. Cuomo is the \" best candidate hands down \" and has been \" putting forward a woman's agenda every year, \" branch ceo sonia ossorio tells the observer. \" nixon's ruminations about running hasn't lit anybody's fire necessarily, \" ossorio adds. \" so many people are skeptical about the idea of celebrity politicians. \"",

Macri earlier this month donated 16,666,000 pesos, or nearly $ 1.2 million, to scholas occurentes; francis reportedly instructed the charity's branch in argentina to give it back, with the guardian reporting that the pope was perturbed at the donation being painted by the media as proof of warming relations between the two. The herald reports that francis instructed scholas'directors to return the money, writing in a letter, \" the argentine government needs to address so many needs you shouldn't be demanding a single penny from it. \" and so last thursday they did, specifying that in returning it they were \" taking into account that some may try to distort this gesture... With the aim of creating confusion and sowing division among argentines. \" the guardian has one more detail from francis ' letter, by way of local media. It reports francis added in a postscript to the directors, \" i don't like the 666. \" macri and francis'relationship stretches back to a time when one was buenos aires ' mayor, the other its archbishop.

        "summary": "The prospect of an insanity plea loomed over a hearing in wisconsin today for two girls accused in the \" slender man \" stabbing of a classmate, the milwaukee journal sentinel reports. Two doctors ( one for the defense, one prosecution ) said that one of the 12-year-old girls, morgan geyser, isn't legally competent to stand trial. The judge then approved a request for another examination, of geyser's mental health at the time of the attack — a possible basis for a not-guilty plea — and a competency hearing on august 1 to consider the issue, the ap reports. Geyser's attorney objected, saying his client hasn't entered a plea and there's no probable cause to go to trial yet. But if the judge deems geyser mentally incompetent, she can't be tried, convicted, or sentenced in wisconsin ( unless she regains competence ). Insanity is hardly a surprise issue in the case, considering that prosecutors say the girls attacked their classmate to gain approval from a mythical internet figure known as \" slender man. \" the victim, meanwhile, is recovering at home from 19 stab wounds. \" she continues to amaze us in her ability to persevere and move forward — taking one day at a time, \" her family said in a statement.",

According to the telegraph, the photos started getting attention on social media tuesday night. The photos appear to have originated on 4chan alongside others purporting to show amanda seyfriend, jillian murray, alyssa arce, analeigh tipton, and other female celebrities naked, gizmodo reports. A publicist for watson says the stolen photos, which show the actress trying on clothes, come from a fitting a few years ago. \" they are not nude photographs, \" the publicist tells the bbc. While there are photos of a nude woman included alongside the leaked photos of watson, they do not show the woman's face. Watson was previously threatened with a leak of nude photos of her in 2014 after she gave a speech on gender equality at the un. She later said she knew the threat was a \" hoax \" because there aren't any nude photos of her. Watson's publicist says they've spoken to their lawyers about this latest incident. Wednesday is the one-year anniversary of charges against one of the hackers behind a large-scale leak of alleged nude photos of celebrities, including jennifer lawrence. A second hacker was sentenced to nine months in prison last month for his involvement.",

The latest video involves different officers, reports the baltimore sun. It shows authorities repeatedly searching a vehicle during a november 2016 traffic stop but finding nothing, lawyer debbie katz levi of the public defender's office tells wbff. Later, she says, an officer looks like he places an item in the car. Two officers are under investigation, but levi says the video shows \" approximately six officers standing around while this suspected misconduct is taking place, \" per cbs baltimore. The public defender's office said it would not release the video because one of the suspects featured in the video isn't a client; meanwhile, charges were dropped monday in this case. Days earlier, the baltimore state's attorney's office announced 34 drug or weapons cases had been dropped in connection with a jan. 24 body-cam video allegedly depicting officer richard pinheiro planting drugs in the company of officers hovhannes simonyan and jamal brunson.

The announcement will take place in santorum's hometown of cabot, pa., and will mark his second run for president, after he finished second to mitt romney in the 2012 race for the republican nomination. So far, all signs point to him positioning himself as the comeback candidate, despite low poll numbers that might not even qualify him for the first primary debate in august, the washington post notes — a recent realclearpolitics polling average placed santorum 10th among gop candidates at just 2.3 %, the wall street journal notes. \" it was a great campaign last time, \" santorum said earlier this month, per fox news. \" we were clearly the underdog.... We would be in the same position and... We are very comfortable there. \" john brabender, santorum's campaign strategist, echoes that positivity, telling the post that his \" phone rings off the hook \" as consultants vie for a chance to work with his boss, adding that santorum \" wears [ being counted out so many times before ] as a badge of honor rather than something to get angry about. \" but while some speculate that gop \" star power, \" as the paper puts it, is too strong this time for santorum to stand out, the new york times floats a more nuanced theory: that by flying the blue-collar banner in lieu of tackling hot social issues, santorum may not be hitting the right chord with conservative voters. The paper notes a joint appearance last week by santorum and fellow contender mike huckabee in front of social conservatives in iowa: huckabee spoke about religious liberty and \" pumped up the crowd \"; santorum talked about working-class issues and received polite applause.",

But 2016 is no 2012. \"i think he recognizes that it's a lot different this time around, because the field is different and the circumstances are different, \" said iowa activist sam clovis, who supported santorum in 2012 but has not yet committed to a candidate for this election cycle.

Among the explanations: mr. Santorum's success last time was mainly a fluke. This time, there are many more capable contenders. Voters want a fresh face, not a blast from the past. But seldom does one hear what may be an equally likely explanation: mr. Santorum's reinvention from a cultural warrior to a working-class hero is not catching on. Last year",

While nevada hasn't released many details on its planned execution of convicted murderer scott dozier, it has said it will use fentanyl, diazepam, and cisatracurium. According to the ap, nevada, like other states, is having a hard time getting tried-and-true execution drugs. But it already has supplies of the three drugs listed above. Medical experts and anti-death penalty activists are questioning nevada's choice of drugs. Using both fentanyl — currently at the center of america's opioid crisis — and diazepam — better known as valium — would appear to be redundant, a professor of emergency medicine says. And cisatracurium — a paralytic that has been known to cause a suffocating sensation — could \" mask any signs of pain and suffering \" should something go wrong, adds a attorney fighting the death penalty. In fact, the american college of veterinarians forbids the use of paralytics like cisatracurium when animals are euthanized. Nevada is likely to face a legal challenge ahead of dozier's scheduled nov. 13 execution. For his part, dozier says he would prefer a firing squad but isn't concerned about having \" a real miserable experience. \"",

Pay attention to the spacing: \" mueller filed an indictment just as the president left for g-20.in july he indicted the russians who will never come here just before he left for helsinki.either could have been done earlier or later.

On the first occasion, what resulted was \" g-20.in, \" which looked to twitter like a hyperlink, as \".in \" is the internet country code for india, reports the washington post — so it was automatically made into a clickable link. Jason velazquez knew it was an oops, but clicked on the link anyway, saw no one owned it, scooped it up for roughly $ 6, and used it to display a white sentence on a black background: \" donald j. Trump is a traitor to our country. \" he tells cnet the whole process took him 15 minutes, and \" i did it, mostly, because i could. \" velazquez, 37, tweeted about what he had done. Others took note, per the post, including alyssa milano and former mexican president vicente fox, who tweeted \" whoever is behind the g-20.in, is a godd --- genius. \" giuliani noticed by tuesday night, at which point he tweeted a gripe with twitter itself: \" twitter allowed someone to invade my text with a disgusting anti-president message. The same thing-period no space-occurred later and it didn't happen. Don't tell me they are not committed cardcarrying anti-trumpers. Time magazine also may fit that description. Fairness please. \" twitter essentially said that's ludicrous as it cannot and does not edit tweets. Here's its statement to the new york times: \" the accusation that we're artificially injecting something into a tweet is completely false. \" the times highlights what many twitter users are highlighting: the fact that giuliani first joined the trump administration as a cybersecurity adviser.

The country has decided to buck last year's international court of justice ruling and send its whalers back to sea under a revised plan. Under the plan submitted to the international whaling commission on friday, japan say the \" scientifically reasonable \" program will catch 333 minke whales in the antarctic ocean during the 2015-16 season, a two-thirds drop from the usual target of 1,000 reports reuters. Japan says the new plan takes the united nations court's concerns about the program into account. In its ruling, the icj said the former program, which allowed japan to get around a ban on commercial whaling, was \" not driven by scientific considerations. \" the court decided that scientists did not need to kill the whales in order to study them, reports the bbc, which notes that japan doesn't hide the fact that the meat from the whales is eaten. When the program resumes, which could be before the end of this year, australia is expected to strongly protest, as is new zealand, where prime minister john key warned last year that the country's navy might get involved if japan decides to defy the ban, 3 news reports. ( scientists from other nations determined that what little scientific research is conducted on the whales is mostly useless and often very strange. )",

According to the ap, the so-called ein gedi scroll sat in storage for decades after its discovery in 1970 for fear any contact with it would destroy it. Scientists using a technique known as \" virtual unwrapping \" were able to \" unroll \" the scroll without actually touching it and read it in 2015, but they published their full findings wednesday in science advances. To view the scroll's contents, researchers had to do extensive scanning and computer modeling, even piecing together more than 100 scanned sections by hand, popular archaeology reports. The result is the first animal-skin scroll to be read fully after being heavily damaged. The ein gedi scroll, which contains text from the book of leviticus, may date from as early as the first century, making it up to 500 years older than scientists initially believed in 2015. It also confirms that the modern version of the hebrew bible has been in use for approximately 2,000 years. Previously, the oldest evidence of the modern hebrew bible was from the eighth century. Researchers hope to use \" virtual unwrapping \" to read a number of the dead sea scrolls as well as scrolls destroyed in the eruption of mt. Vesuvius.

Roiland tweeted a photo of his bounty along with a letter sent by the chain, which claimed it had to open a time portal to get him the goods. Per io9, the letter signed by a \"chef mike \" said, \"we wish we could have brought more sauce through, but we couldn't risk keeping a portal like that open. \" the note went on to joke about the dated trends that could slip back via the portal if they weren't careful, including \"puka shells, bucket hats and boy bands as far as the eye could see. \" roiland and his team have created buzz on social media about the plum sauce, which was released in 1998 to promote disney's mulan. His pleas to bring it back caught on around the web, sparking a change.org petition that now has over 41,000 signatures. Mcdonald's has hinted that roiland won't be the only 1998 culinary time traveler — chef mike's note ended by saying \"a few lucky fans \" will get to \"experience the glory, \" and the chain teased a photo on twitter sunday featuring three more jugs of the sauce alongside the time and date of the rick and morty show's return to adult swim.",

The donations were organized by the greater omaha chamber of commerce after manning's 44 pre-snap \" omaha! \" calls during the denver broncos ' win over san diego received national attention. Eight omaha companies combined to donate $ 800 to manning's \" peyback foundation \" for every time he yelled the city's name during the broncos ' victory over the new england patriots. The participating companies are conagra foods, first national bank of omaha, mutual of omaha, omaha steaks, cox communications, centurylink, union pacific railroad, and dj's dugout sports bar &amp; grill. But what does \" omaha \" mean in football terminology? it's quarterback-speak for \" opposite, \" according to this fox sports video, but as business insider points out, no one other than the team really knows the exact meaning. Traditionally, the pre-snap call has been used to tell the offense the ball is going to be snapped on the next sound ( so \" omaha... Hike! \" with the ball snapped on \" hike \" ), but manning has used it in a variety of ways. So, the short answer is, we may never be able to pin down an exact meaning.

        "summary": "\" the inescapable conclusion is that brian winchester killed mike williams, \" said a lawyer for williams ' widow, a day after she was charged with her husband's murder. Ethan way's statement lines up with a grand jury indictment claiming winchester shot and killed his best friend at florida's lake seminole on dec. 16, 2000; mike was assumed to have died in a boating accident until his body was finally found in december 2017, reports the tallahassee democrat. But way's claim that denise williams \" had absolutely nothing to do with \" her husband's death does not sync with the indictment. It alleges denise williams was a \" principal \" figure who — together with winchester, whom she'd go on to marry — plotted her husband's death over almost nine months and covered up the crime for years after collecting $ 1.75 million from life insurance policies. Describing herself as \" still in shock by everything that has happened, \" mike's mother tells wctv she wants \" any and everyone involved in mike's death held responsible. \" but winchester — serving 20 years for kidnapping denise in 2016 as their marriage collapsed — hasn't been charged in his friend's death, nor do his lawyers expect he will be. A state attorney says charging anyone in addition to denise \" depends on where the evidence and the investigation goes, \" per the democrat. Way concludes winchester is \" making up a story to try to either reduce his 20-year sentence or avoid getting even more time. \" however, a prosecutor tells the democrat that such a comment is \" premature \" since \" way hasn't started the discovery process \" and is \" not aware of what evidence the state has. \"",

Anthropologists have found that bones uncovered from a gladiator graveyard in the ancient city ( once the capital of the roman province of asia, in what's now turkey ) reveal a mainly beans-and-grain diet, with nary a giant chicken leg to be found, phys.org reports. The warriors also indulged in an interesting beverage: a drink made of plant ashes that was supposed to \" fortify the body after physical exertion and … promote better bone healing, \" according to the lead writer of the study published in plos one. Scientists used spectroscopy to measure the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur levels in the gladiators ' bones, as well as the ratio of strontium ( a chemical element that's found in ash ) to calcium. Their diet was apparently not so different from that of the general population, the researchers say, but reports at the time referred to gladiators as \" hordearii, \" or \" barley eaters, \" possibly meaning that they ate lower-quality grain than other people. And as for the ash tonic? \" things were similar then to what we do today — we take magnesium and calcium ( in the form of effervescent tablets, for example ) following physical exertion, \" the study leader notes.

But the only song we hear andré benjamin ( aka andré 3000, the frontman and fashion plate of outkast ) perform all the way through, in his uncanny impersonation of hendrix, is a cover version of – well, i shouldn't spoil the bizarre surprise. Let's just say it's a well-known pop song by somebody else, which hendrix did indeed play live at a famous london gig.

The pageant footed the $ 10,000 bill: \" it's our responsibility, \" kim said. \" if she has no good nose, then maybe, if she likes, we can operate on her nose. If it's breasts, then breasts. \" but kim says noe's resulting trip to seoul with her mom dragged on for months in an \" illegal attempt \" to obtain a visa, the daily news reports ( a power clash between event organizers and noe's mom may be fueling all this, says the bbc ).

As time explains, the supermoon occurs when the moon is at its closest point to earth, and sunday's will be around 14 % bigger than usual. And a lunar eclipse, of course, is when the earth is between the moon and the sun, leaving the moon in earth's shadow but still getting some sunlight. Oh, and it will also be a full moon. It's been 30 years since all three things ( supermoon or \" lunar perigee, \" full moon, and total lunar eclipse ) have occurred at once, and it's not expected to happen again for 18 years. What can you expect? as the christian science monitor puts it, \" earthly viewers will see a large ' blood moon ' glowing burnt-red in the eastern sky. \" and how can you see it? at least 2 billion people will be able to view it from north and south america, europe, africa, as well as parts of west asia and the eastern pacific. The moon will start moving into shadow at about 9: 07pm eastern time, and will be entirely in shadow and tinted red at 10: 11pm for about 72 minutes.

The bureau of land management says a mountain biker in idaho started a 73-acre blaze in the boise foothills on wednesday afternoon after setting his toilet paper alight following a \" rest stop \" in a ravine, nbc news reports. Fire officials say the man thought he was doing the right thing, but an ember set some dry grass on fire and the blaze, dubbed the hull fire, quickly spread out of control. It was contained roughly six-and-a-half hours later. \" i guess when you gotta go, you gotta go, \" blm spokeswoman carrie bilbao tells ktvb, though she stresses that burning toilet paper in dry conditions is a very bad idea; the agency advises people to bury human waste or remove it under the \" pack it in, pack it out \" policy. The man, who came forward yesterday and was handed a citation for starting the fire ( that's usually accompanied by a $ 250 fine ), may also have to pay the full cost of putting it out, which the idaho statesman reports could be in the thousands to cover the helicopters, air tankers, and ground crews that stopped the blaze from spreading to neighborhoods. Bilbao tells the statesman a toilet paper-related fire has occurred on blm land at least once before. ( here are five ways to, well, poop better. )",

Back in august, south korea began broadcasting anti-pyongyang propaganda up to 15 miles into north korea, via loudspeakers, after two south korean soldiers were maimed by land mines outside a border post. South korea ended the broadcasts after north korea apologized and a deal was reached, but it said it would resume with any \" abnormal \" situation. The latest test is a \" grave violation, \" an official says, per reuters. \" our military is at a state of full readiness, and if north korea wages provocation, there will be firm punishment. \" the official notes south korea is also in talks with the us about deploying us strategic assets on the korean peninsula. While the test has been denounced outside the country, north korea has used it to boost support. \" internally, nothing else is as effective \" as the development of a new nuclear bomb, says a north korean defector, particularly as north koreans believe they're at constant risk of an attack from the outside. \" let's begin 2016 … with the thrilling explosion of our first hydrogen bomb, so that the whole world will look up to our socialist, nuclear-armed republic and the great workers ' party of korea! \" kim told a north korean newspaper, in which five of its six pages included praise for the test on thursday, per the journal.

Network exec andy lack defended nbc in a memo to employees monday, but reporter ronan farrow then accused lack of fudging the facts, reports cnn. It all centers on a serious accusation: did nbc try to kill the story that farrow, then a reporter for the network, presented to his bosses about weinstein? one of farrow's former producers made that allegation last week, accusing nbc of a \" massive breach of journalistic ethics. \" but in his memo, lack insisted that what farrow presented wasn't \" fit for broadcast \" because it had too few women willing to go on air to corroborate the accusations. \" contrary to recent allegations, at no point did nbc obstruct farrow's reporting or ' kill ' an interview, \" lack wrote. He added that the network let farrow \" go elsewhere \" to flesh out the story, to the new yorker. Farrow, however, says lack's statement \" contains numerous false or misleading statements, \" per the new york times. For one thing, \" the suggestion to take the story to another outlet was first raised by nbc, not me, \" wrote farrow, \" and i took them up on it only after it became clear that i was being blocked from further reporting. \" he said his piece for nbc was \" twice cleared and deemed'reportable ' by legal and standards only to be blocked by executives who refused to allow us to seek comment from harvey weinstein. \" lack says that's not true, and he dismissed as \" baseless \" the accusation that weinstein himself exerted some kind of influence on nbc's decision.

Obama runs up taxpayer debt not in the billions but in the trillions. He has expanded the federal government's control over home mortgages, investment banking, health care, autos and energy. The weekly standard summarizes obama's approach as omnipotence at home, impotence abroad. The president's actions are so bizarre that they mystify his critics and supporters alike. Consider this headline from the aug. 18, 2009 issue of the wall street journal: \"obama underwrites offshore drilling. \" did you read that correctly? you did. The administration supports offshore drilling – but drilling off the shores of brazil. With obama's backing, the u.s. Export-import bank offered $ 2 billion in loans and guarantees to brazil's state-owned oil company petrobras to finance exploration in the santos basin near rio de janeiro – not so the oil ends up in the u.s. He is funding brazilian exploration so that the oil can stay in brazil.
