As part of the process to buy the gt, cena had to agree multiple times to maintain ownership of it for at least two years. But the lawsuit claims he sold it oct. 20 — less than a month after receiving it — and in doing so caused ford \" loss of brand value, ambassador activity, and customer goodwill. \" the lawsuit states cena admitted to selling the car \" for cash to take care of expenses \" and said he would \" make it right \" but has not yet done so.

            "John cena attends the premiere of \" 'daddy's home 2″ in los angeles. ( afp photo / valerie maconvalerie macon/afp/getty images ) ford motor company is suing the actor and wwe superstar john cena after it says he broke a contract not to resell a high-end sports car, according to a lawsuit filed this week. The breach of contract lawsuit filed in federal district court in michigan alleges that cena, for many years one of the wrestling network's biggest stars, resold a limited edition ford gt, that buyers must agree to keep for two years. Cena, 40, paid about $ 460,000 for the 650 horsepower sports car in liquid blue, which was delivered to him around the end of september, the complaint said. The theme of the car's",
            "John cena sued by ford for selling $ 500k supercar john cena: sued by ford for selling $ 500k supercar exclusive john cena is on ford's $ #&amp; % list for allegedly flipping his new $ 500k ' 17 ford gt -- violating a contract with the company -- and they're takin ' him to court. According to the lawsuit filed in u.s. District court in michigan, cena was \" selected from thousands of applicants for the opportunity to purchase the ford gt. \" ford says cena signed a deal in which he agreed to hold onto the car for at least 2 years... Prior to unloading it. However, ford claims, soon after receiving the car, cena flipped it for a big profit. \" mr. Cena has unfairly made a large profit",
            "Remember how ford hand-picked its buyers for the $ 450,000-plus ford gt supercar? wrestler john cena was one of the 500 lucky ones who got one, but he quickly sold the car afterwards. Now ford is taking him to court, as buyers were contractually obligated to keep the car for two years before selling it. Automakers tend to cringe when their rare supercars are resold for a higher price after they're sold. For one, that means they're not the ones making the big bucks off of their own products. Marques like porsche, ferrari, aston martin and ford heavily discourage buyers from flipping their cars, sometimes using contracts like the one cena signed for the ford gt. If the company finds out you made a profit flipping your new supercar,"

        "summary": "When candace derksen went missing on her way home from school in winnipeg in the fall of 1984, it took six weeks for volunteers to find her body — just a few hundred yards from her home, in a storage shed, where the 13-year-old who loved horses had been bound with twine and left to die of exposure. That desperate wait would prove to be the blink of an eye compared to how long it's taken for her family to see justice. Now, almost exactly 32 years since candace was found, her parents are bracing for another trial of the man whose dna was linked to the twine and at the scene, reports winnipeg tv news. Mark edward grant was arrested and charged with the killing in 2007, then convicted in 2011, but the verdict was overturned two years later. The manitoba court of appeal ruled that the trial judge should have let the defense present evidence that a similar case had occurred nearby in 1985, where someone used the same knots to tie up another girl and leave her for dead in a shed — while grant was in custody for another crime, reports the cbc. No suspect has been charged in that case, but the new trial is expected to include evidence of a third person involved in both crimes. Grant, who is in his 50s, insists he's innocent. \" i have a hope that we ' ll get to the bottom of it this time, \" derkson's mother, wilma, tells the winnipeg free press. The trial starts monday and is expected to last 34 days. \" it's very surreal, having to go [ through ] a rerun of a trial, \" she says. \" we have no clue what this will do to us. \" ( a teen witness may help solve a murder at sea in 1978. )",

Identity thieves could use the numbers to rack up their own medical charges — and in the process, alter medical records, which could cause potentially life-threatening mix-ups. \" it's like an unlimited credit card that gets you ' free ' access to expensive services and drugs, \" the ceo of id experts tells nbc. \" everyone thinks about credit cards and bank accounts, but medical identity theft can be much more damaging and extremely hard to fix. \" he advises people worried about medical id theft to scrutinize every statement their insurers send very carefully for suspicious items. More: the wall street journal reports that anthem stored social security numbers unencrypted within its own database ( encryption occurred only as info exited or entered it ). Encryption isn't a federal requirement, and as the journal puts it, encryption may have made the data a little less useful to anthem; for instance, it would have added a level of difficulty to analyzing health trends. Anthem has set up a website to address customer concerns, but even with the free identity-theft protection the company is offering, privacy experts warn that people affected by the biggest health-care data breach on record could face problems for years to come, reports the indianapolis star. \" this could very well be a lifelong battle either for myself or any of my children, \" says one anthem customer.

        "summary": "Matt damon plays a botanist-astronaut stuck on mars while nasa debates whether to risk six lives in an attempt to save one in the martian. It seems to be a winner, with a 93 % favorable rating from both fans and critics on rotten tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: peter howell says the film is \" out of this world. \" not only does matt damon deliver a performance worthy of oscar attention, but he does so in \" one of the year's best movies and widescreen 3d experiences, a crackerjack adventure that celebrates human ingenuity over mechanical contrivance, \" howell writes at the toronto star. He adds the flick is \"'real-fi ' rather than'sci-fi, ' because it's so down-to-earth in its realism. \" the film is \" a hopeful love letter to science and math, american resolve, the power of friendship, and the dream of a world in which nations set aside their differences to unite to bring one man home, \" writes richard roeper at the chicago sun-times. The entire cast is strong, but \" damon strikes just the right notes of comedy, nerdy tech talk, moments of despair, and triumph, \" he writes. \" the movie lives and breathes on his performance, and he comes through in every scene. \" if director ridley scott was aiming for a good time, \" mission accomplished, \" writes adam graham at the detroit news. But at almost 2.5 hours, the film is too long. \" there's one big action set piece too many, one more disco joke than was needed. It's not a deal breaker, but it does dull its impact. \" keep an ear out for abba's \" waterloo, \" which might be \" scott's sly wink to his rumored knowledge of the presence of water on mars far ahead of this week's surprise announcement. \" yes, it's long, but the martian \" feels as bouncy and light as a beach ball, \" writes dana stevens at slate. \" in a way, it's saving private ryan without the world war ii setting, \" she writes. \" it's a wry tribute to the qualities that got our species into space in the first place: our resourcefulness, our curiosity, and our outsized, ridiculous, beautiful brains. \" she adds dariusz wolski's 3d cinematography is \" dazzling. \"",

The encounter was captured in a vine that opens with \" you're free to go, \" suggesting that what follows will in fact determine whether said freedom is achieved. A very serious-looking girl then throws rock; the very edge of the officer's scissors is seen, to cheers, hugs, and the girl's very apparent relief. The houston chronicle reports on what the chilifest attendee may have managed to avoid: \" hefty fines, a criminal record, a court appearance, government classes and expulsion from the festival. \" the officers behind the game apparently haven't emerged so consequence-free, though. Burleson county precinct 2 constable dennis gaas tells kbtx that while it's within officers ' purview to give underage drinkers a pass, when they \" play games to get someone out of a ticket, i have a problem with that. \" the three officers who were present for the game were hired by gaas to work the fest, and he says they won't be given such a gig in the future; he's also informed their two respective departments, which can decide if they want to take further action. The daily dot reports the video was posted to a texas a&m forum ( sample comment: \" i love how the friend hugs her like she just won miss america \" ), where one user wrote, \" hey, this is one of my good friends and she doesn't want gifs and posts of this going up all over the internet and would really appreciate it if this post was removed. \" no such luck.",

        "summary": "The supreme court delivered another explosive decision today, ruling that closely-held corporations like hobby lobby can duck obamacare's mandate to provide insurance that covers birth control. Here's what the immediate reaction has been among pundits and politicians: conservatives rushed to embrace the decision. \" the court has made clear today that the obama administration's assault on religious freedom in this case went too far, \" bobby jindal said in a statement. Mitch mcconnell took a similar tack, according to politico, saying that the administration \" cannot trample on the religious freedoms that americans hold dear. \" but jack jenkins at think progress argues that the ruling \" actually hurts people of faith, \" and that mainstream and progressive religious thinkers have largely opposed hobby lobby, arguing that businesses should not be said to hold religious beliefs, and that opposing contraception will lead to more abortions. \" chief justice john roberts ' court is shaping up to be pretty darn protective of that free exercise clause, \" observes the religion news service; in multiple cases now it has supported religious rights over other rights. Still, the court made clear that the next such case might be different, and that \" religion should not always trump the law. \" it's for that last reason that mark joseph stern at slate thinks the ruling was \" surprisingly good for gays. \" many had feared that a pro-hobby lobby ruling would allow corporations to, say, fire gay workers on religious grounds. But justice alito's majority opinion specifically said that the ruling could not be used to shield \" discrimination in hiring \" as a \" religious practice to escape legal sanction, \" and anthony kennedy clarified that this included anti-gay discrimination. The white house responded to the decision by urging congress to take action to help women affected by the decision, the ap reports, and harry reid vowed to do just that. \" if the supreme court will not protect women's access to health care, then democrats will, \" he promised, according to roll call. Democrats believe the gop reaction will \" reinforce overall perceptions of the right as hostile to women, \" one pollster tells politico. But gop strategists are convinced this is a win for them, because they can now say that obama overreached on religious freedom. Besides, as one ad maker says, \" anytime obamacare is in the news, it's a good thing for republicans. \" but don't expect a huge political fallout.

A new study has found that dolphin and bat genes are strikingly similar in nearly 200 genomic regions, livescience reports. Researchers thought to compare the two because both rely on echolocation. It's not that dolphins and bats are evolutionary cousins or anything. Scientists think it's an example of \" convergent evolution, \" the phenomenon of different species in similar circumstances developing similar traits — and similar genes. \" we didn't expect to see more than perhaps 10 to 30 genes converge, \" one researcher says. \" instead, we were able to detect many times that number. \" and while many relate to hearing, vision, and other areas associated with echolocation, most have unclear or unknown functions, science reports.",

Vulture has spent the past few months performing what it calls an \" exhaustive cataloguing \" of the biggest cover-ups in music, literature, film, tv, and \" anything else a celebrity might touch. \" it's come up with 70 of the best, broken down by genre, that show \" the phenomenon in its purest form — paranoia without ideology, or anyway without partisanship. \" here, a few of the categories to get lost in and the stars and institutions caught up in each: celebrities who aren't who ( or what ) they claim to be: filed under \" um, ok, \" this niche includes fervent insistence that stevie wonder isn't really blind, katy perry is a grown-up jonbenet ramsey, and lorde isn't telling the truth about how old she is ( actually, this one isn't so out there ). Stars who've faked their own deaths: according to the truthers, elvis is still among the living, michael jackson has been popping up in different places since his \" alleged \" passing ( even showing up on larry king's former cnn show in disguise as a guy named dave dave ), and andy kaufman has pulled off the greatest hoax of all time — which, knowing kaufman, may be the only truly believable conspiracy theory of the bunch. Celebrity murders: did you know john lennon was really killed by stephen king, ronald reagan, and richard nixon? or maybe it was the cia that offed him because he blabbed that the agency invented lsd. Theories abound about the unfortunate demise of the former beatle and others, including bob marley, tupac, and michael jackson, who was apparently either killed by the iranian government or by the us government on behalf of israel for being pro-palestinian. But wait — isn't he still alive? so confusing. The government's pawns: because of course britney spears was \" an instrument \" of dubya's administration ( a role miley cyrus has now taken on for obama's regime ), nasa faked the moon landing with the help of stanley kubrick, and pokemon go is really a cia surveillance tool.

Stanley mcchrystal. It's a thursday night in mid-april, and the commander of all u.s. And nato forces in afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the hôtel westminster in paris. He's in france to sell his new war strategy to our nato allies – to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually have allies. Since mcchrystal took over a year ago, the afghan war has become the exclusive property of the united states. Opposition to the war has already toppled the dutch government, forced the resignation of germany's president and sparked both canada and the netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. Mcchrystal is in paris to keep",
            "The entourage entered the bazaar. The afghans sensed that an important american had arrived, and they began to gather in groups inside the stalls. Then the general stopped and turned. \"what do you need here? \" mcchrystal asked. A translator turned the general's words into pashto. \"we need schools! \" one afghan called back. \"schools! \" \"we're working on that, \" mcchrystal said. \"those things take time. \" mcchrystal walked some more, engaging another group of afghans. He posed the same question. \"security, \" a man said. \"we need security. Security first, then the other things will be possible. \" \"that is what we are trying to do, \" mcchrystal said. \"but it's going to take time. Success takes time. \" the questions kept coming, and the answer was the same. After a couple of hours",

From animation marvel brad bird, it stars george clooney, hugh laurie, and some impressive young faces. What do critics have to say? \" if only all of director brad bird's fantasy adventure had lived up to its promise, \" writes lisa kennedy at the denver post. \" but isn't that often the way with the future, the subject of this disney mega-ride? such grand hopes — such gifted talent! — not quite met. \" though the film kicks off with strong visual cues, it \" turns into a bloated action fantasy, \" she writes. At least things come together for a \" moving, if mildly sappy \" ending. Tom long at the detroit news can't say enough good things. \" this is summer moviemaking at its best \" and \" as brutally honest as any popcorn film in memory, \" he writes. Bird \" has such a way with gadgetry that the film's two-plus hours whiz by. \" he also manages to keep the film upbeat while drawing attention to the planet's many problems. Long is so impressed, he says the flick \" should be required viewing \" for anyone over 8. \" leave with the thought in your head: we can, we need to, do better. \" yes, \" tomorrowland is a highly original, occasionally even visionary piece of sci-fi filmmaking, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie, \" writes dana stevens at slate. An early scene of a boy's discovery of tomorrowland is a high point, but afterward, \" i could feel myself gradually being drained of the very value this movie holds in the highest esteem: hope, \" she says. She takes issue with what she says is an implied natural superiority of some people over others. For rene rodriguez at the miami herald, tomorrowland is \" a crazy, disjointed mess. But it's the good sort of crazy, and it's the sort of mess you want to lose yourself in. \" surprising for a \" pure sci-fi \" film, it \" breathes and feels real \" and has a \" striking, radiant beauty. \" the narrative is wacky — rodriguez was confused until the final 30 minutes — but to focus on the flaws \" is to miss the giant, wondrous spectacle in front of you, \" he writes. \" only the most heinous of disney villains could hate",

It's the best trump has done in the poll since october, and it shows him being supported by 75 % of republicans and 14 % of democrats. Rasmussen reports says possible reasons for the trump bump include a speech on jobs he gave tuesday, the results of the brexit vote in the uk, and the deadly terrorist attack in istanbul. However, much like with soul mates, there's a poll out there for everyone. A fox news poll released wednesday not only shows clinton beating trump 44 % to 38 % — up from a three-point lead — but that more than half of republicans would prefer someone other than trump. Meanwhile, a quinnipiac university poll released wednesday has clinton's four-point lead over trump shrinking to two points, with both republicans and democrats apparently agreeing that neither trump nor clinton would make for a good president. \" this is where we are.

The horrifying-sounding \" fire challenge \" that the unnamed preteen tried goes basically like this, per cbs new york: pour a flammable substance like rubbing alcohol on your body, purposely light yourself on fire, and then put out the flames before you're badly hurt, followed by a post on social media showing off your attempt. The boy in this case apparently wasn't able to turn the shower on to put out the fire, and he ran out of the bathroom and outside his home, where neighbors helped douse the fire; a babysitter called 911, the new york daily news notes. He was transported to the burn unit at a nassau county hospital, where he's in critical condition but expected to survive, the new york post notes. The boy's initial story to first responders — who sources tell the daily news witnessed skin peeling off of his chest when they arrived — was that he had been burned in an oven accident. Now that the true story has emerged, an er doctor at lenox hill hospital says it may take the boy years to fully recover from his injuries. \" the burns penetrate the skin and soft tissue and then involve the muscle, \" he tells cbs. \" as they penetrate, you lose fluid, causing dehydration, and it causes all these inflammatory markers that drop your blood pressure and can put you into shock. \" the fire challenge, similar to other dangerous viral dares ( read: the cinnamon challenge ) that young people often take part in for a brief moment of internet celebrity, appears to have been circulating online since at least 2014, per reports. \" just to be on youtube — really? \" a local resident tells cbs. \" it's sad that this is what it's come to now. \"",

An anonymous senior us official says there will be an announcement friday that the us will send a small number of special operations forces ( the ap and wall street journal say no more than 50 ) to the northern part of the country to help groups who've made headway fighting the militant group, nbc news reports.

You have to be ready, \" stina naslund tells the local. Naslund is a midwife who works for the solleftea hospital's maternity ward, set to be shuttered at the end of the month and leaving local pregnant women no choice but to drive to one of two other facilities more than 60 miles away when it's time for baby's arrival. This development has prompted naslund and another midwife to debut a course on the ins and outs of childbirth for those stuck in their cars and unable to get to one of those other locations in time. The course will go over how to get through a long drive through rural, often-desolate areas with a very-pregnant passenger, as well as what to do if the baby decides it's not waiting for hospital staff. The maternity ward in solleftea was scheduled for closure in october to save money, expressen reports, via the bbc, and while the head of the swedish association of midwives said she supports the new course, she calls it a \" tragic \" necessity. Naslund adds that the closure is like \" cutting the lifeblood of a society, \" per the local. Others seem to be similarly concerned and have set about making their contingency plans: naslund says she and her partner have had a big response to the course since they announced it on friday.

Assad promised only to form committees and hold \"national dialogues \" that might lead to political reforms or a new constitution.

Protests also broke out as far east as albu kamal, a city near the iraqi border, as far south as daraa, and in the suburbs of damascus, where people shouted, \"no to dialogue with murderers. \" in the north, meanwhile, syrian troops blocked all roads to turkey, to prevent more refugees from fleeing there and to block food and medical aid from flowing in, abc news reports.",

        "summary": "While working as an apple executive, paul devine owned a porsche cayenne and held $ 950,000 across several bank accounts. Only problem: he was getting kickbacks by illegally handing out secrets to apple suppliers that helped them negotiate better deals with apple, 9to5mac and mac observer report. Devine, a former apple global supply manager, was sentenced last week to a year in prison and fined $ 4.5 million — a far cry from the 20 years he initially faced and the mere $ 1 million apple said it hoped to recover when devine was arrested in 2010. Perhaps the bribes he received were higher than initially thought, and he's helped authorities convict others in his scheme, 9to5mac suggests. Indeed, two former directors of jin li mould manufacturing company were charged last year with bribing devine; one was charged on 14 counts of giving devine $ 387,600 in the us, macau, singapore, and china between 2006 and 2009, the straits times reports. Ars technica reports an interesting detail: devine also sold secrets to would-be suppliers for whom an apple contract \" can be a make-or-break moment. \" apple uncovered devine's scheme by looking in the cached email of his company-issued laptop, mac observer notes. Soon after, authorities found big bucks in several of devine's offshore accounts and in cash-stuffed shoeboxes at his home. ( more tech-world drama: portland is suing to give uber the boot. )",

The killer is believed to have killed at least five gay men and possibly up to 14 in 1974 and 1975, sf weekly reports. Police say the killer would approach men in bars, sketch them, and leave with them. The victims were stabbed multiple times; one was nearly decapitated. The bodies were left in the open in locations including beaches and golf courses. Inspector dan cunningham, who recently took charge of san francisco's cold case unit, tells cnn they have a suspect and are now \" connecting the dots. \" cunningham says he is trying to track down a european diplomat believed to be one of three people who were assaulted by the doodler and survived. The victims provided information that helped police create a sketch. But fearing their sexuality would be exposed, they refused to testify when a man matching the suspect's description was arrested outside a bar with a butcher knife and a book of sketches, meaning the man, who is apparently still the main doodler suspect, was never charged. Cunningham says he plans to work with the crime lab to see if a usable dna sample can be taken from 43-year-old crime scene evidence. If the suspect is still alive, he would now be in his early 60s. Cunningham says he plans to release an updated sketch of the suspect when he has \" all his ducks in a row. \"",

        "summary": "The brett kavanaugh confirmation saga heated up in a big way monday, with increased calls for a delay in the process to examine the allegation that he tried to sexually assault a girl at a high school party in the 1980s. President trump himself said a \" little delay \" is no big deal. Kavanaugh, meanwhile, insisted anew that the allegation is false, and both he and accuser christine blasey ford say they are willing to go before the senate judiciary committee. Details and related developments in the contentious supreme court nomination: now what? as of now, the senate judiciary committee was still scheduled to vote on kavanaugh's nomination thursday, reports the wall street journal, but the prospects of that happening were growing increasingly unlikely. All 10 democrats on the panel want chairman chuck grassley to postpone while the allegation is investigated, and, crucially, at least one republican on the 21-member committee also favors a delay. That would be jeff flake. Will they testify? whether kavanaugh and ford will appear before the panel is unclear. Grassley said he was trying to arrange phone call interviews with the pair, seemingly to avoid in-person testimony, per the ap. Senate majority leader mitch mcconnell supported this \" by the book \" approach, saying private interviews were the standard approach in such cases. But democrats, especially dianne feinstein, were resisting; they want the fbi to pick up the investigation from here.",

        "summary": "As puerto ricans struggle after hurricane maria, a request to ease shipping restrictions for urgently needed supplies was turned down tuesday by the trump administration. Reuters notes the jones act, aka the merchant marine act of 1920, mandates only us-built and -flagged ships may ship between us coasts. In the past, the us government has approved temporary waivers to the law after storms — including harvey and irma — so foreign ships, which are either cheaper or more available, can speed supplies to affected areas. But with puerto rico, the department of homeland security said damaged island ports are the real impediment and that a waiver would do little good. Greg moore, a spokesman for the department's customs and border protection agency, noted in a statement that us ships had \" sufficient capacity \" to move supplies to puerto rico. Nearly 10 us representatives had requested the waiver monday, with an extra push by sen. John mccain, per the hill. As to why the waiver was granted after the other two recent hurricanes, moore said \" the situation in puerto rico is much different, \" noting that barges — which the us fleet is said to have in adequate supply — are what will haul much of the supplies for humanitarian needs. In an op-ed for the new york times, nelson denis dives deeper into the jones act, calling it the \" law strangling puerto rico. \" although supporters such as shipbuilders say the law keeps us jobs, puerto rico has come down on it for years, noting the high costs for basic necessities such as food, clothing, and fuel that result. Many now fear that, without the waiver, puerto rico will \" be left behind in this disaster, \" an energy expert tells reuters. \" this is not the time to price-gouge the entire population, \" denis adds.",

Even more astounding: although figuring out a lobster's age is an inexact science, the owner of the restaurant that acquired larry estimates, based on the lobster's growth indicators, that the crustacean is about 110 years old. Tin fish owner joe melluso tells abc news that the lobsters he buys from vendors usually top out at 5 pounds. A picture of larry circulated on social media, and a family reserved him for tuesday night's dinner — until a group of other locals caught wind. Real estate lawyer brooke estren and friends pitched in $ 300 to buy him, plus shipping costs to send him to the maine state aquarium, where he ' ll be examined and either housed permanently or put back in the sea. The group wrapped larry in a saltwater-soaked towel, packed him in a special shipping container, and mailed him to maine wednesday. \" if you're going to live 110 years, you deserve to live and not be someone's dinner, \" estren tells the herald. And even though larry may not be quite as ancient as melluso guessed he is ( the executive director of maine's lobster institute pegs him as probably somewhere between 60 to 80 years old ), the restaurant owner got \" choked up \" contemplating all the effort put into saving the lucky lobster, the herald notes. \" my whole life's been about fish and seafood, \" melluso says. \" [ larry's rescuers are ] looking to protect and serve the species in a responsible way.

The little blue cans went global when the army shipped troops overseas, and spam even sustained hungry russian troops.

Ham is, thankfully, one of only six ingredients that also include salt — a lot of it.

Oled screens, now used by the company only on the apple watch, would be a step up in technology from the current iphone screens — thinner, tougher, brighter, and less of an energy suck. But the real trick is, of course, would be the phone's ability to bend in half: the patent describes a device that can fold multiple ways and even grip your clothes instead of having to go into a pocket, reports cnn. Sound interesting? well, don't hold your breath. Such a phone isn't actually possible yet, notes the guardian. No folding oled screen is known to exist, and flexible screens are only just appearing at trade shows. The iphone 8 is expected to be the first apple phone to include an oled screen — of the non-bending variety — though samsung already employs oled screens.

What some are saying could weaken that defense are the often-secretive algorithms that drive these social networks. \" the defendants create unique content by matching isis postings with advertisements based upon information known about the viewer \" and \" finance isis's activities by sharing advertising revenue, \" a lawyer for the three families tells fox.

This comes somewhat as a surprise, since the original purpose of the legislation was to restrict free speech on the internet. The internet community as a whole objected strongly to the communications decency act, and with eff's help, the anti-free speech provisions were struck down by the supreme court. But thankfully, cda 230 remains and in the years since has far outshone the rest of the law. Section 230 says that \" no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider \" ( 47 u.s.c. § 230 ). In other words, online intermediaries that host or republish speech are protected against a range of laws that might otherwise be used to hold them legally responsible for what others say and do. The protected intermediaries include not only regular internet service providers ( isps ), but also a range of \" interactive computer service providers, \" including basically any online service that publishes third-party content. Though there are important exceptions for certain criminal and intellectual property-based claims, cda 230 creates a broad protection",

To wit, not eligible for overtime are \" the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of \" various food products. Because there was no comma after \" shipment, \" the drivers argued that packing for shipment and distribution ( a single entity revolving around packing ) wasn't overtime-eligible, but that distribution without packing ( what the drivers do ) was. Oakhurst argued that maine's legislation style guide nixes oxford commas, and that \" distribution \" was meant to be separate, but the drivers pointed out all other separate items on the list were gerunds ending in \" ing, \" so \" distribution \" didn't fit the pattern, quartz notes.

        "summary": "Beacon island off the western coast of australia is better known as murder island or batavia's graveyard. The reason is simple: after the dutch east india ship batavia ran aground on a nearby reef in 1629, 282 survivors made it to beacon island, where at least 115 of them were slaughtered by mutineers over a period of three months, reports national geographic. Experts know this in part based on journals later published by the ship's commander. But 400 years later, new details of the massacre are still emerging. Dutch and australian archaeologists digging at the island say they've uncovered a neat grave containing the bodies of five people who were, surprisingly, not murdered. The \" careful and respectful burial \" is clearly \" not the hurried work of hiding murder victims, \" archaeologist al patterson tells perth now. \" these may be people who died in the days following the wreck but before the mutiny and mass killings were under way, \" patterson says. Natgeo reports they may have died of dehydration. Researchers, who plan to publish a study on the bones next year, say the discovery provides one more piece to the puzzle of what australia's 60 minutes has called \" australia's first and biggest mass murder. \" it's \" totally lord of the flies stuff, \" patterson told the program last month, describing how \" psychopath \" jeronimus cornelisz led a murderous rampage when left in charge of the survivors while the ship's commander took a longboat in search of help. Cornelisz was ultimately hanged after the commander returned. As for his victims, \" horrible things happened to these individuals \" but \" the archaeology allows us to get their story told, \" peterson says, per fox news. ( more on the batavia here. )",

The first-in-the-nation program is intended to educate parents and reduce deaths by sudden infant death syndrome, the philly voice reports. Funded by a grant from the cdc, the state intends to distribute 105,000 cardboard boxes to parents who sign up online and take a course. The kits come packed with diapers, wipes, breast pads, a onesie, and other supplies. Take those goodies out and a mattress and fitted sheet double as baby's first bed, per babble. Temple university tested the program last year in a trial in collaboration with the la-based maker baby box company, which runs similar initiatives in 12 countries. Putting newborns to bed in a box is nothing new in finland, which has been doing it since 1938, per the bbc. The practice is credited with reducing infant mortality there to the world's lowest rate, 1.3 deaths per 1,000. The us ranks 23rd, with 6.5 deaths per 1,000. The idea seems to be catching on. Scotland began handing out boxes to new parents on jan. 1, and alberta, canada, is testing the idea, per the independent. Dr. Kathie mccans, who pushed for the new jersey initiative, calls the boxes \" adorable, \" but says education is the focus. The compact space is safer for little ones, though many people might not know that. \" we need to change care takers ' knowledge about what constitutes safe sleep, \" she tells cbs philly.

Other charges against her — including neglect, abuse of a corpse, and altering the scene of a death — were dropped as part of a plea deal, reports wane. The charges stemmed from january 2015, when authorities found the burned body of arnold's son, owen, in the woods after a family member told police that the boy was missing, reports the journal gazette. Police determined he died of blunt force trauma. Police say arnold wasn't involved in her son's death. Instead, they say her live-in boyfriend, zachary barnes — now serving 50 years in prison for owen's murder — fatally struck the boy inside their mobile home near bluffton. However, authorities believe arnold helped barnes wrap his body in plastic and hid it in a dresser before barnes and zachary barker — a friend who also lived at the home and was 16 at the time of the crime — attempted to dismember the body and eventually set it on fire in the woods. Barker pleaded guilty to abuse of a corpse and dealing meth in 2015 and was sentenced to 14.5 years in prison.

At the independent, leonie roderick writes that she grew up in the netherlands and didn't think twice about black pete being offensive. But now she's ok with phasing him out. \" for hundreds of years, the dutch were one of the world's biggest slave traders, shipping and exploiting slaves around the globe to help grow the dutch empire, \" she writes. \" to this day, black pete continues to perpetuate the racist stereotypes that formed a large part of this appalling culture. \"",

        "summary": "Two of the suicide bombers in monday's brussels attacks have been identified as brothers, while a third key suspect has been named but remains at large. Belgian state broadcaster rtbf identified the brothers as khalid and brahim el bakraoui, and said they are believed to have blown themselves up, reports the ap. The brothers, both belgian nationals, had served time in prison for crimes including carjackings and attempted armed robbery, reports the new york times. Khalid el bakraoui reportedly had rented an apartment that was raided last week in an operation that led cops to top paris attacks suspect salah abdeslam. There's some confusion about whether the brothers are both pictured in a surveillance photo of three men from the brussels airport: the guardian reports khalid may be responsible for the subway bombing, suggesting that a fourth unidentified attacker is among those three in the photo. Authorities were expected to clear up the confusion later tuesday. Meanwhile, multiple belgian media outlets have named najim laachraoui as the man in white in the photo. The bbc describes laachraoui, a 24-year-old belgian citizen, as a \" key bomb maker \" and says he is believed to have played a role in the paris attacks as well. Belgian media initially reported that he had been arrested, but those reports have since been walked back. The new york times, meanwhile, takes a closer look at that surveillance photo, showing the \" calm \" and \" determined \" look on the faces of the men about to die — and the telltale single gloves they were wearing, apparently to conceal their bomb triggers. The developments come as european union's unofficial capital awoke under guard and with limited public transport after 34 were killed in the airport and subway bombings.",

This is very bad news, and yes, it could usher in a post-antibiotic era — if we let it. But here's why you shouldn't panic just yet, and what you can do that would be far more productive. It's always the same story with antibiotic resistance: we develop a drug ( technically, in most cases, we discover a drug in nature and figure out how to manufacture it in bulk ), it works great for a while, and then some microbes start to show signs of resistance. Soon, lots of bacteria are resistant, and pretty soon after that, we have to stop using it. This has happened with numerous antibiotics that were once the workhorses of modern medicine",

None of the three elaborated on the point, which puts the pentagon at odds with the white house decision not to arm the rebels. The plan to supply them with weapons was floated by david petraeus and backed by hillary clinton, but the white house feared a prolonged conflict, reports the new york times. Today's capitol hill testimony will likely put a focus on president obama's \" cautious response to the conflict in syria, \" says the wall street journal's story. In other testimony, the two military leaders defended the us response to the benghazi attack, but mccain and other republican lawmakers said it fell way short.

But on thursday, deep divisions over what to do about one of those issues — the rising violence in syria — spilled into public view for the first time in a blunt exchange between senator john mccain, republican of arizona, and the leaders of the pentagon. Testifying before the senate armed services committee, defense secretary leon e. Panetta acknowledged that he and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, gen. Martin e. Dempsey, had supported a plan last year to arm carefully vetted syrian rebels. But it was ultimately vetoed by the white house, mr. Panetta said, although it was developed by david h. Petraeus, the c.i.a. Director at the time, and backed by hillary rodham clinton, then the secretary of state. \"how many more have to die before you recommend military action? \" mr. Mccain asked mr. Panetta on thursday, noting that an estimated 60,000 syrians had been killed in the fighting. And did the pentagon, mr. Mccain continued, support the recommendation by mrs. Clinton and mr. Petraeus \"that we provide weapons to the resistance in syria? did you support that? \" \"we did, \" mr. Panetta said. \"you did support that, \" mr. Mccain said. \"we did, \" general dempsey added. Neither mr. Panetta nor general dempsey explained why president obama did not heed their recommendation.

And with mr. Obama in the middle of a re-election campaign, the white house rebuffed the plan, a decision that mr. Panetta says he now accepts. With the exception of general dempsey, the officials who favored arming the rebels have either left the administration or, as in mr. Panetta's case, are about to depart.

Liberal activists chanted slogans opposing morsi's power grab and the country's hastily compiled new draft of a constitution: \" leave, leave! \" they cried, reports reuters. \" he has made himself a fort and he says it is a temporary fort — this is something we cannot believe, \" said one protester in cairo. \" we've spent 30 years being betrayed — we won't believe morsi, he will remain seated in the chair and not leave it. \" some protesters cut through the palace's barbed wire fence to rally close to the perimeter wall; police retreated into the palace grounds, probably to avoid any skirmishes, the new york times reports. On the sidelines, activists are debating whether to boycott a referendum for the new constitution — scheduled for dec. 15 — or organize to vote against it. And at least three tv networks went dark and 11 newspapers refused to publish today to protest limits on freedom of speech in the draft constitution. The government is already investigating three journalists for allegedly insulting the judiciary, which one activist called \" authoritarianism. That is a lack of understanding of what ' free expression ' means. \"",

One big reason is that the archaeological record doesn't mesh: these two supposedly ruled in the 10th-century bc, but where's the physical evidence? now, however, an archaeological team from mississippi state university has dug up six clay seals in israel that support the idea of such reigns, reports science daily. The seals are tangible evidence that some kind of government was operating near what is present-day gaza in the iron age, say the researchers. As io9 explains, the seals \" do not have any writing or symbols that declare ' king david was here. ' \" but they lend weight to the theory that david and solomon \" were actual historical figures — or, at the very least, based upon other rulers who lived during the period recounted in the bible. \" the site in southern israel known as khirbet summeily was previously thought to be an ancient farm, notes archaeology, but the clays seals upend that theory. \"you have either political or administrative activities going on at a level well beyond those typical of a rural farmstead, \" says an msu researcher.

Harris tells nbc bay area that police, who arrived after the jogger left, said the only thing they could fine the jogger for is littering, as drew's items are technically debris. The san francisco chronicle reports locals have provided drew with blankets, clothing, and food, and a gofundme campaign has raised $ 5,500 as of this writing. In an odd twist, another facebook livestream video taken saturday shows a jogger, who the chronicle notes appears to be the same man, knee-deep in the lake fishing items out. He's asked if he had been the one to throw them in but denies it. A couple of minutes into the livestream, he seemingly grabs for the phone.

        "summary": "An ancient pottery shard seems to support the biblical story of king solomon and shows he was running a pretty complex operation 3,000 years ago — at least according to one israeli scholar. \" we are dealing here with real kings, and the kingdom of david and solomon was a real fact, \" gershon galil tells fox news. He bases this on the \" ophel inscription, \" the oldest alphabetical writing ever found in israel. Galil translates the 8 letters on a clay-jug fragment as yah-yin chah-lak, or \" inferior wine. \" this, he says, was the cheap stuff given to laborers who built the young city of jerusalem.

        "summary": "Four women have accused that ' 70s show actor danny masterson of rape, and his publicist is catching heat for how she's defending him. Two of masterson's accusers have told huffpost jenni weinman is refuting and helping cover up ( along with others in the scientology community ) his alleged crimes, via a campaign the women say includes threats and lies. One of her claims in particular is raising eyebrows: that masterson couldn't have raped at least two of the women because he was in romantic relationships with them at the time. Chrissie bixler was one of masterson's exes ( she was with him for six years ), and she says he raped her twice when she was unconscious. Bixler was a scientologist at the time ( she's since left the church ), and as scientologists discourage followers from going to the cops, bixler filed a report with the church about masterson's alleged transgressions. She says church officials told her because she was dating masterson, she hadn't been raped. Late last year, bixler tweeted about masterson's and the church's pushback. Then came the phone call between weinman and another accuser. In the recorded call, heard by huffpost, weinman pooh-poohs that victim's claims, then adds about bixler: \" they were boyfriend and girlfriend and they dated, and then they f --- ed for a year after they broke up, so i don't think that [ counts as rape ]. \" bixler tells huffpost she slept with masterson three times after they broke up, not for a year. Uproxx notes bixler's husband has been posting his own recent tweets about masterson, claiming the lapd and tmz are also part of the coverup. Weinman tells huffpost in a statement: \" i never saw anything but a consensual relationship between danny and chrissie, \" adding: \" i would never cover up wrongdoing. \"",

            "In a recorded phone call obtained by huffpost, jenni weinman, the longtime publicist of actor danny masterson, suggested to one of the four women accusing masterson of rape that a woman who is in a relationship with a man can't claim that man raped her. In that conversation, weinman remained unfazed when presented with accusations that her client had raped women while they were unconscious. Two of the women accusing masterson of rape have told huffpost that weinman played an integral part in covering up masterson's alleged crimes. They say weinman worked to cover up the allegations by threatening, cajoling and lying to victims in an effort to silence them. The los angeles police department and the los angeles county district attorney's office have been investigating masterson for nearly a year for allegedly raping four women. The women, two of whom were in romantic relationships with masterson at the time of the alleged incidents, say that masterson violently raped them after spiking their drinks, causing them to slip in and out of consciousness. ( masterson's attorney disputes this, saying that as a scientologist, his client has a strict anti-drug policy. ) the investigation, which is being led by one of the top prosecutors in the district attorney's office, is significant in scope, but does not appear to have had any effect on masterson's career. Masterson is currently starring in a netflix show, \"the ranch, \" with his former \"that ' 70s show \" co-star ashton kutcher. Netflix has told huffpost it is aware of the accusations but isn't seeking to suspend masterson pending results of the investigation. Masterson has denied all allegations of rape and said that the encounters in question were consensual. In a statement, weinman told huffpost: \"i respect the law. I would never cover up wrongdoing or threaten people based on the scope of my work. As a publicist it's my job to gather information and make informed decisions about media matters. As an outsider looking in i never saw anything but a consensual relationship between danny and chrissie, with whom i maintained a cordial relationship after they broke up.

        "summary": "Could the whole subprime mess have been avoided if bankers had some inspirational gandhi quotes laying around? that's the question the chicago tribune asks after reviewing a study that shows employees who display \" moral symbols \" — an \" ethically righteous quote \" or religious item like rosary beads — are not only less likely to be asked to engage in dishonest practices at work, but also may influence their higher-ups to exhibit better behavior. \" the idea is that being authentically moral and being proud of that and showing that can have positive consequences, \" study co-author maryam kouchaki says in kellogg insight. The study, published in the academy of management journal, also found workers who show these symbols aren't subject to backlash. The northwestern university and university of north carolina researchers used a series of five lab experiments and one survey to venture into the waters of workplace ethics. In one test, the scientists asked subjects to send a deceptive or honest email ( their pretend company would \" lose \" more money if they sent the honest email ) to \" colleagues \" who either had or had not sent an intro email with an ethical quotation attached. While 64 % of the participants sent the deceptive email to the imaginary co-worker who hadn't included the quotation, only 46 % of subjects sent the deceptive email to a co-worker who had included it. \" we have a tendency to avoid making things dirty that are clean, \" kouchaki explains. Knowing this could empower employees of an unscrupulous boss. \" we want people to feel that... They have control over their situations, and that there are things they can do to prevent questionable behaviors from others, \" she adds.

            "Believe what you will about spells to ward off evil spirits, but new research describes an easy way to ward off evil bosses. Moral symbols — such as a religious poster hanging on a cubicle wall, or an ethically righteous quote embedded in the signature of an email — can keep employees from getting pulled into an employer's dishonest business practices and can even discourage the employees'superiors from engaging in nefarious acts, according to researchers from northwestern university's kellogg school of management and the university of north carolina's kenan-flagler business school. Employees asked to fudge financials, help cover up a marital affair or participate in broad deceit of the kind exposed last year at volkswagen, which admitted to cheating on emissions tests through a \" defeat device \" in its diesel engines, may feel forced to choose between their morals and their jobs. However, displaying moral symbols can offer protection against unethical requests — like wearing a necklace of garlic to guard against vampires, only based on scientific observation, not fiction — according to the study, which is scheduled to appear in the academy of management journal. \" we want to empower people, \" said maryam kouchaki, assistant professor of management and organizations at kellogg, who co-wrote the study with sreedhari desai at unc. \" how can we behave such that we reduce these",
            "Do you ever feel pressured to compromise your ethics at work? maybe your boss asks you to lie and say he is at a meeting when he really went golfing, or a supervisor asks you to turn a blind eye when some petty cash goes missing? you are not alone: nearly 10 percent of workers reported feeling this way in a 2013 ethics resource center survey.

            "Believe what you will about spells to ward off evil spirits, but new research describes an easy way to ward off evil bosses. Moral symbols — such as a religious poster hanging on a cubicle wall, or an ethically righteous quote embedded in the signature of an email — can keep employees from getting pulled into an employer's dishonest business practices and can even discourage the employees'superiors from engaging in nefarious acts, according to researchers from northwestern university's kellogg school of management and the university of north carolina's kenan-flagler business school. Employees asked to fudge financials, help cover up a marital affair or participate in broad deceit of the kind exposed last year at volkswagen, which admitted to cheating on emissions tests through a \" defeat device \" in its diesel engines, may feel forced to choose between their morals and their jobs. However, displaying moral symbols can offer protection against unethical requests — like wearing a necklace of garlic to guard against vampires, only based on scientific observation, not fiction — according to the study, which is scheduled to appear in the academy of management journal. \" we want to empower people, \" said maryam kouchaki, assistant professor of management and organizations at kellogg, who co-wrote the study with sreedhari desai at unc. \" how can we behave such that we reduce these",
            "Do you ever feel pressured to compromise your ethics at work? maybe your boss asks you to lie and say he is at a meeting when he really went golfing, or a supervisor asks you to turn a blind eye when some petty cash goes missing? you are not alone: nearly 10 percent of workers reported feeling this way in a 2013 ethics resource center survey.

        "summary": "\" hopefully she can start to mend her relationships and reunite with her children, \" shannon smith's lawyer said wednesday after an ohio judge granted her early release from prison, where she's serving 10 years for the slaying of her children's father. Smith's 10-year-old son, bradyn — who saw his mom stab his dad, robbie takach, in the chest while takach held his 15-month-old daughter in 2009 — had asked the warren county judge to keep smith in jail because \" i am afraid of her. \" however, the judge ruled that smith, convicted of voluntary manslaughter, will be released after serving seven years in december 2016. She will be on house arrest for one year and probation-like community control for three, reports the washington post. \" the judge said she needed to be out to be there for her children — but her children are afraid of her, \" the children's paternal grandmother, who is raising them, said after the hearing. She had previously expressed that she thought bradyn and younger sister brooklynn would be \" better able to handle the situation \" if their mom was released after the full 10 years, at which point they'd be 15 and 13, respectively. Smith told the judge, \" i ' m so very sorry and i hate what i've done. I hate the pain that i've caused so many people, \" reports wlwt. Her lawyer added she \" cried throughout the hearing \" and had a hard time hearing her son's letter. But he also argued that bradyn expressed different feelings in the company of smith's family members. \" obviously he's nervous, but he has told them he's excited to see his mother, \" he said.

But raunigk has since decided to raise all four babies. \" i always find it very aggravating that one has to fulfill certain cliches, \" she says. \" i ' m not actually afraid...

Researchers in both studies found that even low-dose aspirin carries a risk of internal gastric bleeding, and the newer study also found that older patients who were not at high risk of cardiovascular disease saw no health benefits from taking aspirin daily. \" we knew there would an increased risk of bleeding, \" a study co-author tells nbc news ( aspirin is a blood thinner ). \" but not only did it not decrease risk of disability or death, it did not decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke, and there was an increase in the rate of death. \" aspirin has been widely used in healthy older adults to protect against cardiovascular disease and cancer. But the new international study followed 19,114 seniors for an average of 4.7 years. It found similar survival rates as well as rates of disability, dementia, coronary heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes for the half taking 100mg of aspirin daily and the half taking a placebo. But internal bleeding ( hemorrhagic stroke, bleeding in the brain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other bleeding ) was found in 3.8 % of patients taking aspirin versus 2.7 % of those taking a placebo. There was also a small increase in the number of cancer deaths in the aspirin-treated group, the new york times reports. One cardiologist not involved with the study notes that in the time since the original research on aspirin was done, patients can now take other medications to lower cholesterol and blood pressure, and suggests it's time to \" phase out \" the broad use of preventative daily aspirin.",
