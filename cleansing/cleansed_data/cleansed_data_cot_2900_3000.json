Laurita's injuries were consistent with him being \"accidentally stepped on \" by one of the elephants after he had fallen to the ground, according to chief deputy tim carroll of the knox county sheriff's office. The elephant caused internal injuries and multiple fractures to laurita, ultimately causing the asphyxiation, said carroll in a press release tuesday afternoon. The police did not release further information about how laurita fell or what he was doing at the time. Hours before the cause of death was released, family and friends were",
            "Hope — a former veterinarian who turned a small farm in midcoast maine into a sanctuary for two retired circus elephants was killed tuesday morning when one of the animals apparently stepped on him after he fell in their enclosure. James laurita, co-founder of hope elephants, was found dead in a corral shortly after he went in to feed the two elephants, rosie and opal, around 7 a.m. Additional images two women lay flowers tuesday outside the home of james laurita. Many residents in the close-knit community of about 1,500 found it difficult to talk about his death. Gabe souza/staff photographer search photos available for purchase: photo store → knox county chief deputy sheriff tim carroll believes laurita fell into the corral and hit his head on concrete. An autopsy conducted later tuesday by the state medical examiner concluded that laurita, 56, died from asphyxiation and multiple fractures resulting from compression of the chest, presumably because one of the giant mammals stepped on him. It was not immediately clear tuesday what would become of the hope elephants organization or the animals themselves in the wake of laurita's death. The federal occupational safety and health administration has been called in to investigate"

        "summary": "Most teenagers spend their free time playing video games or hanging out with friends. In kansas, they run for governor. Last september there were two teens ( tyler ruzich and jack bergeson ) who'd announced they were vying for the state's top seat, and now four more — aaron coleman, ethan randleas, dominic scavuzzo, and joseph tutera jr. — have joined their ranks. The new york times reports on the six, ranging in age from 16 to 18, gunning for the $ 99,636-a-year post. The influx of minors into the race is a result of the state's rules not imposing any age restrictions, which has led local lawmakers to lobby for an age mandate to avoid in the future what the times deems \" a carnival-like note. \" specifically, a state house bill is in motion to require all candidates to have been residents in kansas for at least four consecutive years, and to be of voting age in kansas. \" as soon as they turn 18, if they want to run for the legislature, knock yourself out, \" bill sponsor rep. Blake carpenter says. The kansas city star notes all six of the teens were under 18 when they announced their candidacy, and they're expressing different reactions to carpenter's bill. \" i think it's trying to disenfranchise candidates, \" says bergeson, 17. Ruzich, who will turn 18 a month or so before 2018's election day, calls the bill a \" common-sense proposal. \" in the case of these teens, though, even if the bill goes through, it wouldn't become law until january — meaning if any of them win in november, they'd become the new governor. Not that hopes are especially high that will happen, at least for one candidate. \" the day a 17-year-old wins governor of any state will be the day pigs fly, \" the 16-year-old tutera says. \" [ but ] hey, we're here, we've got ideas. \"",

That has halted all but the most essential operations and marred the one-year anniversary of president trump's inauguration in a striking display of washington dysfunction. Last-minute negotiations crumbled as senate democrats blocked a four-week stopgap extension in a late-night vote, causing the fourth government shutdown in a quarter century. Behind the scenes, however, leading republicans and democrats were trying to work out a compromise to avert a lengthy shutdown. Congress scheduled an unusual saturday session to begin considering a three-week version of the short-term spending measure, reports the ap. The ap separately tracks the path to the shutdown: it was shortly after 7: 30pm thursday when the republican-led house passed a 30-day spending plan. With less than 29 hours until the shutdown deadline, attention quickly shifted to the senate, where 60 votes were needed. In a sign of the trouble to come, the senate couldn't even agree on when to adjourn for the night. When lawmakers did return friday morning, a shutdown suddenly seemed more likely than ever.",

The dpa news agency reports that johann rehbogen, who's on trial facing hundreds of counts of accessory to murder, told the muenster state court he didn't oppose his posting to the camp from 1942 to 1944 out of fear for retribution, the ap reports.

        "summary": "For native americans living in the 12th century, cahokia was the place to be. Now researchers think they've uncovered a major reason why the hub located near what is now st. Louis disappeared — massive flooding of the mississippi river. Researchers dug up soil samples from two local lakes and found telltale evidence of catastrophic flooding around the time that cahokia was flourishing. \"we're talking big floods, once a century, \" a researcher from the university of wisconsin-madison tells the st. Louis post-dispatch. It seems that the region enjoyed an unusually flood-free period from roughly 600ad to 1200ad. In that time, people flocked to the fertile region, turning cahokia into what national geographic calls the \" largest prehistoric settlement in the united states. \" ( another national geographic piece frames it as \" america's first city. \" ) but they may have gotten too complacent. People began moving from higher elevations into what we now know to be a flood plain, and the population boomed with the cultivation of maize. It peaked around the mid-12th century, but the resumption of regular floods appeared to begin taking a toll. By about 1350, the city had been abandoned. Previous theories on its demise have focused on deforestation, overhunting, political volatility, and, especially, drought. \"we are not arguing against the role of drought in cahokia's decline, but this presents another piece of information, \" says the lead author of the study at the university. Another researcher suggests the flooding could have been the final straw. \"it would have had a particularly destabilizing effect after hundreds of years without large floods. \" ( maybe an ancient brewery would have helped? )",

The movie, which stars sam riley, garrett hedlund, kristen stewart, and kirsten dunst, made its debut at the cannes film festival yesterday, reports the bbc. Director walter salles told reporters that he tried to stay true to kerouac's improvisational style in his sex, drugs, and jazz-filled semi-autobiographical novel. The movie is \" about the loss of innocence, it's about the search for that last frontier they ' ll never find, \" salles says. \" it's about also discovering that this is the end of the road and the end of the american dream. \" early reviews have been mixed, with the telegraph's robbie collins calling it a \" tedious loop of beatnik debauchery. \" but kerouac's original had its share of criticism when it came out in 1957: a time reviewer called the work a \" barbaric yawp of a book. \"",

The boy was hospitalized in critical condition with head trauma and pulmonary contusions, according to charging documents, and was found to have bruises and contusions on his face, ears, neck, spinal column, abdomen, and buttocks. Some of these were in \" varying stages of healing, \" the documents state, which wjla notes indicates past abuse. He has not regained consciousness and prosecutors say he will have permanent injuries if he survives, per the herald-mail.

        "summary": "The new supreme court term starts monday, and one of the most important cases the court hears could be the one brought by a white woman against the university of texas. Abigail fisher says she was rejected while minority students with lesser academic qualifications were admitted, the washington post reports. Arguments begin next month, and if the court rules broadly, colleges across the nation could be barred from using race as a factor when admitting students — which the court has allowed, in a limited fashion, since 1978. The conservative court has shown its distaste for racial preferences in the past, but on the other hand, more than 70 amicus briefs have been filed in support of ut's diversity policy from a wide range of places including the military, many fortune 100 companies, and professional athletes. Civil rights issues will dominate the high court's term, nbc news notes. Among the other issues that could come before the justices: a number of challenges to the defense of marriage act, which defines marriage as between one man and one woman for federal purposes, are likely to come before the court. If doma is struck down, the federal government would have to recognize gay marriages performed in states where they are allowed. The court could also address the challenge to california's proposition 8, which made gay marriage illegal in that state. But some legal experts think the supremes may choose to tackle doma now and wait on the issue of the constitutionality of gay marriage. The court may also hear a challenge to the voting rights act, which has since 1965 required states with a history of discrimination to get permission from the federal government before changing any election procedures. Opponents of the law say it's unfair and unnecessary now.",

        "summary": "The teary-eyed boy who hugged a police officer during a heated ferguson-related rally in portland in 2014, resulting in a viral photo, is now feared dead after his family's suv plunged off a california cliff. Police believe jennifer and sarah hart, both aged 38 or 39, were traveling with their six adopted children when their 2003 gmc yukon drove off the pacific coast highway on monday. The pair were found dead inside the vehicle, which fell 100 feet onto the rocky shore, per usa today. Markis, 19; jeremiah, 14; and abigail, 14, who weren't wearing seat belts, \" came out \" of the vehicle and also died, officials say, per oregonlive. Authorities believe 15-year-old devonte hart and two other siblings, 16-year-old hannah and 12-year-old sierra, were also in the suv at the time of the crash, but an air and ocean search has found no sign of them. While the search continues, authorities are trying to determine what led to the crash. Police say there are no brake marks but also no evidence to suggest an intentional act. But there were problematic signs, say a couple who lived next to the family in woodland, wash. They say they reported the family to authorities after devonte repeatedly asked them for food, claiming his parents withheld it as punishment. The state's department of social and health services tried three times to contact the family between friday and tuesday but was unsuccessful, reports oregonlive; it notes sarah hart was convicted of misdemeanor domestic assault in 2011 after one of her daughters turned up at school with bruises. The family also didn't answer the door when authorities visited the home friday, police say. Neighbors say the family's vehicle was gone the next day.",

However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed urls to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the urls for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl ( and therefore we never got to them ). We also included repeated crawls of some argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed.

Workers unearthed the remains while doing survey work for a planned extension at victoria primary school in edinburgh. Initially believed to be from the bronze age due to their poor condition, the remains have since been carbon dated to the 16th or 17th century, according to a press release. Based on a facial reconstruction of the skull, it is believed that the skeleton belonged to a man in his 50s. Archaeologists have determined, the press release says, \" that the skeleton was likely to have been a murder victim — and quite possibly a pirate. \" that conclusion is supported by a gibbet — a type of gallows the release notes was \" commonly used to execute witches and pirates \" — that stood 600 years ago near where the school is now located. And, the man was unceremoniously buried close to sea, rather than in nearby graveyards. His body was likely \" displayed in plain sight of ships to deter fellow pirates \" before being \" discarded in nearby wasteland, \" per the release. Given the school's proximity to the harbor in the historic fishing village of newhaven, workers had anticipated finding remains of the original harbor and shipbuilding.

Experts at aoc archaeology carbon dated the bones to the 16th or 17th centuries and, working with forensic artist hayley fisher, created a facial reconstruction of the man who is thought to have been in his fifties. The school, the city's oldest working primary school, is located near newhaven harbour where a gibbet once stood on the dockyards 600 years ago. It is believed that the man could have been executed for piracy or other crimes before being buried in a shallow, unmarked grave. Archaeologists said the condition of the bones and location of the burial close to the sea and gibbet, rather than at one of three nearby graveyards suggests the man was killed before being displayed to deter other pirates. Councillor richard lewis, culture convener for the city of edinburgh council, said: \" edinburgh has an undeniably intriguing past and some of our archaeological discoveries have been in the strangest of places. \" thanks to carbon dating techniques, archaeologists now know that the skeleton was likely to have been a murder victim - and quite possibly a pirate. \" it's fantastic"

The average cable subscription is $ 90 and expected to climb to $ 125 soon, but consumer advocates say that could drop if people could opt out of pricey channels such as espn. The industry, however, says bundling is the only way it can operate given ever-rising programming costs, and the la times notes that a la carte might not necessarily lower bills: \" if a cable network were suddenly in 30 % fewer homes, it would need to find a way to make up for that lost revenue and the easiest approach would be to just charge the people who still get the channel even more. \"",

After months of watching mitt romney twist in the media glare, a growing number of president barack obama's supporters — though confined for now to a noisy minority of liberals — are peering into the obama-might-actually-lose abyss for the first time after last week's disastrous first debate.

The media mind-set is dependent not on fact, but on attitude. And now comes a man who can change that attitude: joe biden. Say it ain't so, joe. Say it ain't all on you, joe, as you prepare to meet the janesville juggernaut, paul ryan, in the \"who gets lucky in kentucky? \" vice presidential debate at centre college in danville on thursday.

The afghanistan rights monitor ( arm ) said in a report that, of the 2,421 civilians the group registered as killed in conflict-related security incidents in 2010, some 739 were under the age of 18. It attributed almost two thirds of the child deaths to \" armed opposition groups \" ( aogs ), or insurgents, and blamed u.s. And nato-led forces for 17 percent. The arm report said many of the reported child casualties occurred in the violent southern provinces of kandahar and helmand, the traditional strongholds of the taliban insurgency.

The aggressive enforcement of marijuana possession laws needlessly ensnares hundreds of thousands of people into the criminal justice system and wastes billions of taxpayers'dollars.

Not counting \" executive time \" from 8am to 11am, trump's real timetable begins with a security briefing at 11am, which tends to be followed by more \" executive time \" before lunch, swan writes. He notes that george w. Bush usually got to the oval office by 6: 45am, while barack obama generally started his day with a workout and got to the office by 9am or 10am, according to former aides. Swan says trump is usually back in his residence by 6pm. Trump often has a meeting or two during his time in the oval office, though a lot of his time is spent making phone calls and watching tv in the adjoining dining room, per swan, whose sources say that trump held breakfast meetings in the early days of the administration but soon began pushing for later starts. In response to the axios story, white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said trump's morning includes a mix of oval office time and time in his residence, though it always includes phone calls to world leaders and cabinet members, among others, cnn reports. Trump is \" one of the hardest workers i've ever seen and puts in long hours and long days nearly every day of the week all year long, \" she said. \" it has been noted by reporters many times that they wish he would slow down because they sometimes have trouble keeping up with him. \"",

The body of kay grayson, 67, was found in the woods near her mobile home on monday, though she may have died earlier this month, tyrrell county sheriff darryl liverman says. While it's not clear who or what killed her, she appears to have been dragged by a bear to her final resting spot 600 feet from her home. \" she was a character, \" liverman tells the virginian-pilot, which reports the sheriff's office was often on the receiving end of calls from grayson regarding hunters in the area. The outer banks voice reports she would \" call to the bears in sing-song \" then feed them dog food or peanuts. Some reportedly ate right from her hand, and a friend tells wcti12 she had named them all. After an early career as a professional dancer, she spent time on the water, and won a sailing race in bermuda in the ' 80s. For the past 20-plus years, though, the black bears had become her focus, and she lived among them without electricity or running water on hundreds of acres of land left to her by a wealthy man who at one time traveled regularly with her by boat. In the end, bears were her great passion, the sheriff said. Sgt. Mark cagle of the north carolina wildlife resources commission describes grayson as \" very cautious \" about the bears, and says that she told him she had stopped feeding them — and stopped allowing them to wander into her home — in recent years. Her remains have been sent to the medical examiner's office in greenville. ( last year, a college student was killed by a bear just a few dozen miles outside of manhattan. )",

A sampling: \" transgender or gender nonconforming. What the hell does that mean? like you're not a woman or a man? \" \" the dude can look like a lady and the city is going to pay for it! \" \" does that mean then they ' ll also, if women want a boob job, they ' ll pay for a boob job, because i think that's only right. \" \" the services that will be paid for under the new coverage — gender reassignment surgery, psychological counseling, because you're probably a nutjob to begin with. \" the comments stirred up immediate criticism of the kimberly and beck show, including an online petition to have them fired. It worked, with parent entercom pulling the trigger today and issuing an apology, reports twc news. The local city newspaper thinks entercom is acting only because ad dollars are at stake and shouldn't be able to rid itself of the controversy so quickly, while conservative radio host bob lonsberry slams the new health-care changes as \" lovelycare \" in honor of mayor lovely warren.

The utah county sheriff reports that colby glen wilde, 29, and lacey dawn christenson, 26, face multiple charges, including child endangerment and drug distribution — though the salt lake tribune reports these charges don't touch on what allegedly happened at the hospital. Having used heroin and prescription drugs heavily throughout her pregnancy, christenson admitted to police she knew her daughter would be born addicted. When hospital staff weren't looking, she and wilde allegedly rubbed a crushed painkiller called suboxone on the girl's gums to mask her symptoms. The case only began to surface two months later, when wilde allegedly grabbed items from a walmart shelf and immediately tried to return them; police say he dropped his baby, who was strapped into a carseat, two times while attempting to flee, reports gephardt daily. The utah division of child and family services took custody of the couple's four children; the youngest three kids tested positive for meth. In late june, police say a search warrant led to the discovery of drugs and related items all over the house, including next to a bassinet and sippy cup.

She read online about a person whose eyes appeared white instead of red in photos, a possible cancer indicator. Her husband patrick blew it off, but julie, still worried, took a smartphone shot of avery: \" i did not want to take the picture because i had this dreaded feeling in the pit of my stomach, \" she says. \" i took the picture, and boom: his whole pupil was just white — and that's when i knew. \" a specialist looked at avery and said his eye was covered 75 % in tumors; in fact, he'd likely been blind there his whole life, although the tumors started growing just 6 weeks earlier. The doctor diagnosed him with retinoblastoma, an unusual eye cancer that often starts in early childhood; 250 to 350 us children get it every year, according to the national institutes of health. Doctors removed avery's unhealthy eye and will replace it with a prosthetic one, and plan to keep testing the boy for signs of other cancers. \" if we did not get this eye out, the cancer would spread to his blood and to his brain, \" julie tells abc news. \" our lives went from normal to cancer to a cancer survivor in three weeks.

        "summary": "Like the theropod dinosaur t. Rex, chilesaurus stood upright, with strong hind legs and shorter front limbs. But its flat teeth were more closely related to ornithischians like triceratops and stegosaurus. That's just one thing that irked scientists when chilesaurus was named a theropod following its discovery in chile in 2004, per the guardian. After examining 450 anatomical characteristics of early dinosaurs, scientists now understand why it wasn't a neat fit. They say chilesaurus isn't a theropod at all. \" a perfect half-and-half mix \" of theropods and ornithischians, the \" frankenstein \" species is actually the first \" transitional \" dinosaur to suggest the two groups are related, cambridge university researcher matthew baron tells the bbc. Researchers previously had no evidence to suggest theropods and ornithischians diverged on the dinosaur family tree, according to the study in biology letters. But this split \" seems to have happened because of [ a ] change in diet for chilesaurus, \" which researchers now believe is one of the earliest ornithischians at about 150 million years old, baron explains in a release. Its inverted, bird-like hip structure allowed for a complex digestive system, and over time, as it apparently \" became more advantageous for some of the meat-eating dinosaurs to start eating plants, \" this characteristic reappeared in other ornithischians before a distinctive beak. Theropods, meanwhile, went their own route, scientists suggest. ( t. Rex apparently couldn't run. )",

In the 1960s, indian archaeologist debala mitra concluded that the ruins at nigrodharam in kapilvastu district could well be older than the seventh century, and today's team of archaeologists from durham university in the uk and unesco, among others, confirms that the area's history may in fact stretch back hundreds of years earlier, reports the kathmandu post. After digging an enormous trench some 85 feet long, 16 feet deep, and 5 feet wide, the team stumbled upon a post hole that's 4 inches deep and 6 inches in circumference. This first post hole has led archaeologists to look for others in the area, and it's believed to date back to the buddha era because of the wood and bamboo used in the structure. The un reports that the dig is hoping to establish the first scientific dates of the original construction of the large temple complex, which could even link this site to others across the region. ( this buddha statue actually contains mummified remains. )",

Still others have been harassed, chen says. The media has not been allowed to visit chen's home village, where christian bale and a cnn camera crew were roughed up by guards when they tried to visit the blind dissident last year. Chen says he is having a hard time keeping in touch with family members in shandong because most of their phones have been seized by officials, who he wants to see punished for the abuse he suffered during 19 months of illegal house arrest. Chen is being treated for injuries suffered in his escape and an intestinal problem that had gone untreated. He says threats to his family thus far won't delay plans to leave china with his wife and two children and study in the us.

She delivered her boy a few hours later, and both mother and baby were doing fine. It's not clear what happens next, but italian newspapers report that her fellow sisters in san severino marche have expressed an interest in helping raise the child.

The nun who gave birth last year is now a former nun and is said be happily living in rome with her son.

        "summary": "When gregory watson first described his theory on how the 27th amendment to the us constitution — proposed in 1789 but still unratified in 1982 — might finally be passed in a 1982 course paper, both his teaching assistant and professor at the university of texas were unimpressed. \" i didn't see anything that was particularly outstanding about it, \" says then-government professor sharon waite, who approved the c- grade on the paper, leaving watson with a c grade in the class, per kut. But watson found that the amendment — proposed by james madison and stating pay raises members of congress granted themselves could only go into effect after the next election — had been approved by nine states. Believing the necessary 29 more states could be persuaded to approve the amendment, too, watson vowed to \" get that thing ratified. \" and he did, in 1992, after sending numerous letters to state lawmakers. However, some of his disappointment over his university grade remained — up until march 4. During what watson, 54, believed was to be a talk about his role in ratifying the amendment, a ut professor presented him with an envelope containing a request to update his course grade to an a+. It was signed by waite, who cited watson's \" heroic efforts to prove the professor and ta wrong \" as the reason for the change. Waite tells the american-statesman that she initially thought watson's c- grade was appropriate because she viewed his theory as far-fetched. Now she enjoys knowing she made a mark on the constitution simply \" by making this fellow a grade he didn't like. \"",

The first diagnosis came back in december, but officials really got worried this month, when two more people from the same school came down with the disease, wtop reports. In all three cases, the patients had the active, contagious form of tb. Now the fairfax county health department is launching an investigation, and trying to identify anyone who may have been in close contact with the patients. The county's health director initially said that the two diagnosed this month were students, but then backed off from that statement, refusing to confirm whether they were staff members or students. Fairfax county is no stranger to tb — it had about 90 cases last year, the washington post reports — but most cases originated overseas, and fewer than 30 cases across the state involved people under age 24.",

Health and school officials said the disease was diagnosed this month in two students at the springfield high school after an initial case was discovered in december. Gloria addo-ayensu, the county's health director, said her department decided to conduct a broad investigation because three cases were found at lee high school within six months. Officials said the investigation could determine whether there are undiagnosed cases among students and the staff. Barbara andrino, a doctor who specializes in tuberculosis for the health department, said tuberculosis can move between people by way of droplets that contain bacteria. \"an individual contracts tuberculosis by breathing bacteria in the air, \" she said. Typical symptoms include a persistent cough, possibly with excessive mucus or blood. Addo-ayensu said about 90 tuberculosis cases were identified in the county last year.

But in spain, she felt a little odd and took a pregnancy test; it came back positive, the herald sun reports. She figured she must have recently gotten pregnant and traveled on, but she then found out from an obstetrician in prague in late august that she was 33 weeks along. She quickly returned home to melbourne, only to find she was actually 38 weeks along ( or possibly more, as re-testing indicated she was overdue ). Days later, she had a healthy baby boy, mason — which was a relief, considering the circumstances. \" obviously, having not known for so long, i was exercising heaps, jumping off cliffs, riding bikes, drinking alcohol, and eating anything and everything, \" she says. \" i had absolutely no real clear symptoms, \" hudson tells the young mummy blog. \" i was still getting regular periods. I wasn't nauseous, no morning sickness, little weight gain. \" ( she was still a size 6 when she flew home, the daily mail reports. ) it wasn't until just after she started her trip — since her boyfriend wasn't coming along, she went off birth control while overseas — that she stopped getting her period and started to suspect they'd gotten pregnant just before she left. Even after getting the positive pregnancy test, \" i wasn't showing at all and had no symptoms, \" she says. In fact, it wasn't until her flight home that she felt her baby kick for the first time. So how is this possible? doctors told hudson she had a tilted uterus and mason was sitting high in her diaphragm, so it wasn't obvious that she was expecting. As whattoexpect.com explains, a tilted or \" retroverted \" uterus leans backward toward your spine instead of forward toward your navel, and it can also sometimes mean that \" your doctor may have trouble finding your baby with a transabdominal ultrasound \" because the baby's \" a bit farther away from those trying to get a peek at him. \" ( this woman had even less time — mere hours — to prepare for giving birth. )",

Renowned stanford expert carlos d. Bustamante found that the \" vast majority \" of warren's lineage can be traced to europe, but he said the test \" strongly supports \" the notion that the oklahoma native has a native american ancestor going back six to 10 generations. The newspaper notes that the results, however, could provide ammunition for both warren's supporters and her critics. On the plus side for her, the results sync with warren's previous explanation that her family lore speaks of a great-great-great grandmother who was part native american. That would make her 1/64th native american. But if the ancestor goes back further, to 10 generations, that would make warren just 1/1,024th native american. ( the globe corrected the two figures after the story's publication. ) warren is expected to run for president in 2020, and she is already using the dna results to push back against a claim made by trump and others: that she made up or exaggerated her native american history to further her career. Warren has denied that, and boston 25 news reports she has released a companion video and website to the dna results. \" i never expected my family's story to be used as a racist political joke, but i don't take any fight lying down, \" she tweeted.",

According to california law, he was to be removed from life support soon after. There's just one problem: \" he's very much alive, \" mom jonee fonseca tells fox40. Fonseca and israel's father, nate stinson, are suing kaiser permanente medical center, claiming that removing israel's ventilator would violate their beliefs as well as the rehabilitation act of 1973, the americans with disabilities act, and the first, fourth, and fourteenth amendments, per courthouse news. \" god is telling me not to let go, \" fonseca writes on a gofundme page seeking $ 50,000 to transfer israel to a hospital in new jersey, which has a religious exemption that allows brain-dead patients like jahi mcmath to remain on ventilators. \" our hearts go out to this family as they cope with the irreversible brain death of their son, \" a hospital rep says. But though israel's heart is still beating, \" three different physicians have administered brain death examinations and each found the results to be consistent with brain death, \" the hospital says in court documents, per the sacramento bee. Fonseca and stinson have submitted a declaration from a doctor who says their son's condition could improve. Fonseca also says a video shows israel moving in response to her touch. However, a pediatrician says such movements are actually \" involuntary reflexes that come from the spinal cord \" and israel's condition is irreversible. A judge has extended a motion to keep israel on life support until may 11 while the parties work to reach a settlement. ( scientists are trying to reverse brain death. )",

        "summary": "Scientists are announcing a breakthrough in the study of fertility. They've learned more about how a sperm cell links to an egg cell, offering hope for future treatments — for both fertility and contraception, nature reports. Scientists already knew of a protein on the surface of a sperm cell that allowed it to \" dock \" on an egg cell; it's known as izumo1. Now, they've pinpointed its partner protein — one on the surface of an egg that connects to izumo1. They're calling this newly-identified protein juno, the name of the roman goddess of fertility, nature notes. After linking to izumo1, the protein is gone in less than an hour, preventing more sperm cells from docking on a fertilized egg. So what does this mean for parents-to-be? \" what we can do is perform a very simple genetic screening test that isn't invasive, \" checking on the condition of the protein in women trying to conceive, says biochemist gavin wright in a video, via the washington post. Those lacking the protein \" can proceed directly \" to having sperm injected into egg cells. As for those who aren't looking to conceive, juno could potentially be manipulated to avoid pregnancy.",

            "The search for survivors continued into the night following a deadly gas explosion wednesday that collapsed two buildings where residents complained of smelling gas for weeks, killing six people. Dozens of people were injured and at least a dozen more are still missing as authorities searched the wreckage with cadaver dogs, sources said. One of the deceased was identified as griselde camacho, 48, a public safety officer at hunter college. A second victim was later identified as 67-year-old dental assistant carmen tanco, who was an active church member and traveled to third world countries to provide dental services. Sources said that a third victim was also identified as rosaura hernandez, 21. The fourth person was found in the rubble at around 12: 30 a.m. Thursday, fdny sources confirmed. Two more bodies were pulled from the rubble early thursday morning, bringing the total to six – four women and two men. \"this",
            "Mr. Louire said he was told not to turn on a cellphone or anything else, and to leave the apartment and the building, at 1652 park avenue. He was in the lobby when he heard the explosion. Elizabeth matthews, a spokeswoman for the utility, confirmed that a customer at 1652 park avenue called to report a heavy gas odor at 9: 13 a.m. Two minutes later, two con ed crews were dispatched, and they arrived just after the explosion. The fire department said it received the first report of a fire at 9: 31 a.m., and discovered on arriving two minutes later that the buildings had collapsed. There were a total of 15 apartments in the two buildings; one had a church on the ground floor, and the other had a piano store. The buildings were five stories and about 55 feet tall, according to buildings department records.",

Slovenia captain jan mursak scored the tying goal with 1: 37 left in regulation and the winner 38 seconds into overtime. No one expected this kind of showing from slovenia, which looked overmatched in the first two periods and is mostly known for having a star in los angeles kings captain anze kopitar. There was no kopitar, though — this is the first olympics since 1994 without nhl players, reports the ap, which offers a detailed rundown of the game. Time ( which rounds up some incredulous internet reaction to the loss ) explains the nhl wasn't into the idea of having to take a three-week olympic break and so it barred its players from participating. This leaves a us team comprised of college players and those who play for leagues other than the nhl. Deadspin's assessment: \" it's a bad, bad loss, even if the group stage doesn't eliminate anyone and only serves to determine the seeding for the knockout rounds. \" after each team's first game, slovakia is atop group b, followed by slovenia, the us, and the russians. The americans face slovakia on friday. The us women are off to a much better start: they bested the russians 5-0 on tuesday.",

        "summary": "Germany hit a new milestone in renewable energy on sunday, generating so much power at one point that customers were essentially being paid to turn on their lights or charge their phones. Quartz reports that around 1pm sunday, about 87 % of the power being used in germany was coming from wind, solar, hydro, and biomass power plants. In 2015, the average was 33 %. There was so much power being produced that the cost of electricity briefly dropped to -$ 149 per megawatt-hour, according to the independent. The high mark in renewable power was credited to a particularly sunny and windy day and the relatively low energy use of a sunday morning. Gas power plants were shut down during sunday's renewable-energy surge, but nuclear and coal plants continued to operate, as it was cheaper for them to produce electricity at a loss than to stop for a few hours, then restart. Sunday shows renewable energy can power a massive economy, thinkprogress reports. Germany — the fourth-largest economy in the world — is a leader in renewable energy despite getting only as much annual sunshine as alaska. In comparison, the us receives about 13 % of its energy from renewable sources every year. Germany is aiming to be powered by 100 % renewable energy by 2050. ( venezuela, meanwhile, is dealing with an energy crisis so pronounced it has cut to a two-day workweek. )",

No money seems to have been stolen, but hackers got names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers, reports the wall street journal. They didn't get more sensitive data such as social security numbers or account passwords. Anyone who did their banking online at chase via computer or smartphone this summer was vulnerable. Hackers were able to get into the bank's servers for about an hour at a time over a two-month stretch before the bank stopped them. So why didn't the hackers try to siphon away money? from the new york times report: \" the lack of any apparent profit motive has generated speculation among law enforcement officials and security experts that the hackers were sponsored by foreign governments either in russia or in southern europe. \" the cyberthieves, however, did get what the times calls a \" hacker's road map of sorts \" — a list of every app and program that runs on the bank's computers. If any have known vulnerabilities, the hackers might be able to get back in before the bank gets everything secured.

        "summary": "It's big news, quite literally. New research indicates that the brontosaurus really did exist, some 112 years after scientists declared the opposite was true. The backstory: paleontologist othniel charles marsh and his team discovered the fossils of two long-necked dinosaurs in the western us in the 1870s and had them shipped to the yale peabody museum. There, in 1877, marsh described the first as apatosaurus ajax; in 1879, he dubbed the second brontosaurus excelsus. But then came the blow: in 1903, paleontologists, having found a third similar \" intermediary \" skeleton, asserted that the brontosaurus and the apatosaurus belonged to the same genus. Since the apatosaurus was named first, it lived on, and the brontosaurus became apatosaurus excelsus. Until now. After what a press release describes as an \" exhaustive \" study, british and portuguese paleontologists say the brontosaurus merits its own genus. Scientific american reports that in its quest to reconstruct the diplodocids ' family tree ( apatosaurus is a diplodocid, which is in the sauropod family ), the team analyzed 477 unique anatomical features of 81 sauropod specimens. Wired explains how nuanced the analysis was, describing a search for \" a neck bone with a slightly different ratio of length to width, or a shoulder blade that's a slightly more square [ shape ]. \" explains researcher emanuel tschopp, \" our research would not have been possible at this level of detail 15 or more years ago. \" those specimens who passed the 20 % threshold in terms of differences were considered a unique genus, and marsh's specimen qualified. Smithsonian reports most of the distinctions are \" subtle \" but quotes tschopp as saying, \" the most obvious and visual feature would be that apatosaurus has a wider neck than brontosaurus. \"",

But with the nation in the throes of the depression and fearing a bank run, fdr blocked their release and most were melted down. A few managed to wander out of the mint, however, including 10 that have been at the center of a decade-long legal contest between a philadelphia family that found them in a safe deposit box and the federal government, which claims the family patriarch stole them. The latest chapter in that fight comes via the 3rd us circuit court of appeals, reports reuters, which ruled friday that the feds must return the coins to joan langbord and sons roy and david. At stake is a little more than the $ 200 face value: a double eagle sold for $ 7.6 million in a 2002 auction. The feds think joan langbord's father, gold dealer israel switt, swiped the coins. Treasury seized them when the langbords found them in switt's safe deposit box in 2003 and tried to authenticate them, notes the wall street journal. But when the langbords filed a seized-asset claim in 2005, the government failed to respond in the required 90 days. \" the government knew that it was obligated to bring a judicial civil forfeiture proceeding or to return the property, but refused, \" wrote a judge. \" having failed to do so, it must return the double eagles to the langbords. \" says a langbord lawyer: \" the langbords are thrilled to receive their property back after fighting to vindicate their rights for over a decade. \"",
