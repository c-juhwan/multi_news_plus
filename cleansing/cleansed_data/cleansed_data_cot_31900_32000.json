On sept. 21, latandra ellington wrote her aunt about prison officer \" sgt. Q \" who, she says, threatened to beat and murder her. Further, he would flip his badge around to obscure his name. Wrote ellington, \" auntie, no one knows how to spell or say this man's name. But he goes by sgt. Q and he works the b shift a.m. \" her concerned aunt called the lowell correctional institution on sept. 30 and talked to an officer who said he would \" look after \" ellington. The next day, the 36-year-old was dead. A private autopsy paid for by the family shows that ellington — who had seven months left to serve — died of blunt-force trauma to her stomach consistent with kicking and punching, according to the family's lawyer. That lawyer — daryl parks, a civil rights attorney whose firm represented the family of trayvon martin — on monday asked eric holder to investigate. \" it's not right that these four children would lose their mom, \" parks says. \" while the trail is very fresh, we believe a federal investigation is warranted. \" the florida department of law enforcement says it's investigating, but already has nearly 200 unsolved prison death cases ongoing. Other florida prison deaths include randall jordan-aparo, who allegedly died of gassing in a confinement cell, and darren rainey, a prisoner with mental-health problems who died in a shower so hot it removed the skin from his body, the ap reports. The herald called the single sergeant who records show has a name beginning with q, but still hasn't heard back.",

On aug. 21, 2017, the us will be treated to a total solar eclipse, which is special for a couple of reasons: it's the first in the continental us since 1979. But whereas the 1979 eclipse was visible only to a relative handful of people, the 2017 version will be the first in 99 years to cross the country, from oregon to south carolina, meaning many more eyes will have the opportunity to catch it, reports the washington post. See an interactive map here, and be warned: plan now if you ' ll need to travel for it. \" it's not too early, we promise, \" notes the post at mnn. Campsites on the route already are booking up, and you can expect the same of hotels as the big day approaches. As for the event itself: \" the sun will disappear for about 2.5 minutes, beginning in oregon about 10: 15am local time, \" notes the post, and viewers in south carolina will get the last glimpse about 90 minutes later. Don't live in salem, ore.; casper, wyo.; columbia, sc; or anywhere else on the \" totality \" path? don't fret: live streams will be available and a partial eclipse will be visible in other parts of the country. To make the most of the day, though, you can travel to one of several events, per astronomy, or book a spot on a tour bus. ( it will look something like this. )",

The former boxer made his debut as a fight promoter on friday, and what he said in a post-fight presser at the turning stone casino in verona, ny, is raising eyebrows: \" i ' m on the verge of dying because i ' m a vicious alcoholic and i've been, um, wow... This is some interesting stuff, i've been, um... I haven't drank or took drugs in six days, \" espn reports an emotional tyson as saying, to applause. \" and for me, that's a miracle. \" the 47-year-old went on to admit to lying about his sobriety in the past and pledge to stick to a sober life in the future. \" i ' m never gonna use again, \" he said. Writing for fox sports, tully corcoran wasn't too startled by the admission: \" tyson always has had a tendency to drop his baggage in the middle of the lobby. His many confessions have tended to come straight out of nowhere, which is probably a big part of the reason people like him now.

He notes that \" it wouldn't be entirely without precedent: larry craig reneged on a resignation announcement in 2007, \" and kornacki tweets an article to that end. Though \" in craig's case, his term was up the next year and he just served out his term and didn't run. Franken's seat isn't up till 2020, \" kornacki acknowledges. Other words: at cnn, chris cillizza is bowled over by a different set of words from franken's speech. These: \" i also think it gave some people the false impression that i was admitting to doing things that in fact i haven't done. Some of the allegations against me are simply not true.

        "summary": "President trump says one of the signature achievements of his first 100 days was the appointment of neil gorsuch to the supreme court. Now he's poised to continue the theme with the announcement of 10 nominees to lower federal courts, chosen with the help of the conservative federalist society and the heritage foundation, per the new york times. Here's a look at coverage: the announcement was expected as early as monday, with a similar batch of nominees to follow pretty much monthly for the near future, reports the times ' adam liptak. He notes that two of the names come from trump's supreme court short list: michigan supreme court justice joan larsen, who clerked for antonin scalia, and minnesota supreme court justice david stras, who clerked for clarence thomas. The story lists the other eight as well. Larsen or stras could yet end up on the supreme court, notes a post at the weekly standard, given that federal appeals courts are a \" farm system \" of sorts for the higher court. That's where eight of the nine current justices came from. Conservative columnist jonathan adler, a professor at case western law school, runs through the names and concludes in the washington post that it's \" as strong a list of nominees as one could hope for. \" politico notes that an unusually large number of vacancies will allow trump to \" remake the federal judiciary. \" buzzfeed counts 129 federal court vacancies, accounting for about 14 % of such judgeships. This is a wise political strategy, writes ed morrissey at the conservative hot air blog, because these judicial appointments will shore up trump's \" right flank. \" conservatives may not agree with all of trump's moves in the white house, but they ' ll tolerate them as long he keeps adding conservatives to the federal judiciary. From the left: \"the trump administration has made clear its intention to benefit from republican obstructionism and to pack the federal courts with ultraconservatives given a stamp of approval by the federalist society, \" says nan aron, president of the alliance for justice. \"we ' ll be scrutinizing the records of these nominees very carefully. \" democrats hoping to oppose any of the nominations have one big problem: they ended the use of filibusters on lower-court nominations in 2013, back when they controlled the senate, notes the wall street journal.",

Rob portman has condemned trump's statements, but avoided saying whether he will continue to endorse trump. It remains unresolved whether he thinks trump's comments in a 2005 video, in which he bragged that his power and fame allowed him to grope women with impunity, disqualify trump from the presidency. On saturday, portman's democratic opponent, former gov. Ted strickland, called portman a \" coward \" for not pulling his support. He said portman's silence makes him complicit in trump's behavior. \" unlike a lot of other republicans including [ ohio gov. ] john kasich, who have the moral courage to disassociate themselves from donald trump, rob portman doesn't have the courage to do it, \" strickland told reporters during a campaign stop in lakewood. \" and that says to me that rob portman is more concerned with his own political survival than he is about what's right and best for america.

            "Every once in a while, a pop star comes along who is so visually magnetic, her music so utterly everywhere, that the world can't take its eyes off her. There's no question who that superstar is right now: her name is robyn rihanna fenty. At 21, rihanna's résumé could turn even a music industry veteran a major shade of green: since jay-z signed her to def jam in 2005, she has scored four number-one hits and has sold more than 12 million albums, a number soon to grow with her just-released album ( untitled as of press time ). Add to that rihanna's self-invented style — a mash-up of paris couture and street punk, and possibly the best-known haircut on the planet — and you have a full-on fan frenzy. With all that attention comes a sky-high platform for doing good, and rihanna's used it wisely: in 2006 she quietly started the believe foundation, a fund that provides educational and medical supplies to needy children, and she has personally helped two leukemia sufferers find the bone marrow matches they needed to live. Of course, it's impossible to talk about rihanna without also discussing the february night the singer was brutally assaulted by her then-boyfriend, pop star chris brown. Rihanna has remained mostly silent about that awful experience. But now, with brown out of her life, she's opening up as a way to speak on behalf of victims of domestic violence.

Worse still, 80 % of those conditions could be labeled serious, disabling, or life-threatening. Specifically: of those whose treatment was associated with risks to the pulmonary system, 65 % had lung problems. Of those whose treatment was cardiotoxic, 56.4 % had heart problems. For example, those who got chest radiation often had scarred or leaky heart valves. Those who got brain radiation had mild cognitive deficits much more typical of older people. ( participants in the study were aged 18 to 60, but the average age was 33. ) time reports that 61 % had endocrine problems in the brain and 48 % had memory problems. Bloomberg reports that 62 % of participants had hearing loss, the second-most prevalent issue after lung problems. Reproductive disorders were also common. Even more concerning: many of the conditions had not been diagnosed prior to the study. One 44-year-old participant, who received radiation at age 16, has a healthy lifestyle ( including biking 120 miles a week ) and had no idea until the study was done that he needed bypass surgery. \" doctors may not be thinking about a heart-valve disorder in someone in his 30s, but if you had radiation to your chest at 10, this is something to think about, \" says one of the study authors.",

According to usa today, the jury in porter's manslaughter trial was deadlocked in december, and trials for the other five officers involved were halted while the appeals court decided if porter would have to testify against them. Now those trials are free to resume. The appeals court didn't explain its ruling, which reverses a lower court's ruling, stating it would release an opinion some time in the future, the ap reports. Porter had requested he not be forced to testify against his fellow officers. A defense lawyer says making him do so while his own case remains unresolved could violate his right to not self-incriminate. Porter's retrial is not scheduled until after the other five trials. The ruling could be especially bad news for officer caesar goodson, who was driving the van at the time of gray's death and faces a second-degree murder charge. During his initial trial, porter testified that gray wasn't wearing a seatbelt in the van, and that it was goodson's responsibility to make sure he was. He also testified that gray requested to go to the hospital, but goodson declined, instead picking up another prisoner and driving to the station.

        "summary": "Northwestern university psychology professor william revelle spent years trying to show there are no real personality types. His latest research published monday in nature human behavior points to the opposite conclusion. Using data from 1.5 million survey respondents, it identifies four clear personality types — average, reserved, self-centered, and role model — based on the character traits of neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. \" i believed there were no types at all, \" but the data \" kept coming up with the same four clusters... At higher densities than you'd expect by chance, \" revelle says in a release. Per inverse, four predominant combinations of traits emerged regardless of the researcher in charge or survey questions asked. To check the results, researchers zoned in on teenage boys, whom they referred to as notoriously self-centered, and found them overrepresented in the corresponding personality type, associated with high extraversion but low openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Underrepresented here, females over 15 are more likely than men to be average — highly neurotic and extraverted but not open — or role model, with high scores in all traits but neuroticism. A type isn't fixed, however. As people age, they tend to move away from being self-centered and reserved and toward the role model category, becoming somewhat more agreeable and conscientious, researchers say.

In roar uthaug's tomb raider, swedish oscar winner alicia vikander plays the daughter of a missing adventurer who falls into a world of trouble on a remote pacific island while trying to trace him. Most critics aren't wowed, but take note that audiences give it a higher score ( 73 % to 50 % ) at rotten tomatoes. Samples: chris klimek calls it a \" crappy \" movie. \" nothing in the film is memorable. Not a shot, a line, certainly not one entire scene, \" he writes at npr. The first act is the \" least yawn-inducing \" but still \" shaky, \" he adds. \" inevitably, there's a dull coda that sets up a sequel, but by that point you ' ll have been vainly searching the frame for the words game over for at least half an hour. \" \" it's not that tomb raider is a bust, but there's nothing here we haven't seen before, \" writes adam graham at detroit news. The promise of an ancient curse wreaking havoc \" wasn't any less silly the previous 5,500 times it was used \" and the script \" feels like the same sort of ancient relic those on the island are trying to excavate, \" graham says. Overall, it \" doesn't add enough value to the property to justify its existence, vikander's presence, or your time. \" \" vikander's sheer desire to act the hell out of her underwritten role is impressive \" and she delivers \" more charisma than the film deserves. \" the problem is that tomb raider focuses on \" a derivative archeological adventure story \" thorned with \" cartoonish villainy \" and too little emotion, writes tina hassannia at the globe and mail. She concludes tomb raider \" clearly works better as a video game than a movie. \" on the opposite side of the fence: david edelstein. Left wondering \" if critics understand that there are gradations in junk culture, \" he calls tomb raider \" a tight, fast, well-made b picture that delivered exactly what it promised. \" the action is \" very good, \" the chase scenes are \" well designed \" and there are \" no dumb subplots, \" edelstein writes at vulture.

But that doesn't mean it looks exactly like him, at least in its current state. Likely painted between 1600 and 1610, the portrait — named for its former owner, the duke of chandos — has been scuffed and scrubbed over centuries so that only a thin layer of paint now remains, reports the art newspaper. It's in such poor shape that the national portrait gallery in london, where the painting is held, is considering cleaning it, which could drastically change our vision of shakespeare. Not only would a cleaning remove a layer of discolored varnish on the painting — restoring its original, vibrant hue — but it might also remove alterations made by early restorers. For example, it's known that shakespeare's beard and hair were lengthened at some point, though the painting hasn't been significantly restored since at least 1856, when it first arrived at the national portrait gallery. \" the original restored works can look very different. You could get a dramatic revelation, \" says a member of the fine art restoration company, per newsweek. The gallery's trustees, who must also consider whether a restoration could damage the fragile painting, plan to decide on its treatment next year. ( shakespeare's grave is missing his skull. )",

        "summary": "Bill cosby will learn his fate at a sentencing hearing this week — and he could be in prison by tuesday night. After a two-day hearing beginning monday in norristown, pa., judge steven o ' neill will have the option of sentencing the disgraced entertainer to anything between probation and 30 years in prison, the guardian reports. Cosby was found guilty in april on three counts of aggravated sexual assault for drugging and molesting andrea constand in 2004. Since cosby has no previous convictions, sentencing guidelines recommend one to four years, but o ' neill is not bound by them. The judge will also have to decide whether cosby should be labeled a sexually violent predator, and whether he can remain free pending an appeal, usa today reports. Prosecutors are expected to portray cosby as a serial predator who belongs behind bars, while cosby's lawyers are expected to point to his achievements and philanthropy, as well as the fact that he is legally blind and 81 years old, the ap reports. Constand and five other accusers who testified at cosby's trial may speak at the sentencing hearing, though the judge has rejected a request to allow statements from some of the dozens of other women who accuse cosby of sexually assaulting them. \" i really do hope he does get prison time. He's responsible for his actions, and this is a way to show he's taking responsibility — whether he wants to or not, \" accuser lise-lotte lublin tells time.

In 1983, jimmy \" superfly \" snuka, one of the world wrestling federation's biggest stars, returned to his hotel room after an event to find 23-year-old nancy argentino \" gasping for air and oozing yellow fluid from her mouth and nose, \" according to the allentown morning call. Argentino died the next day, and an autopsy report, which classified the death as a homicide, stated she had brain injuries and scores of cuts and bruises all over her body. Despite snuka being the only person of interest in the case, he was never charged. That autopsy report was never seen until it was dug up by the morning call as part of a 2013 story on the cold case, a story the ap reports prompted the district attorney to send the case to a grand jury last year. Between the autopsy, snuka's multiple accounts of how argentino was injured — including allegedly telling multiple people he pushed her — and previous allegations of abuse on his part against both argentino and his wife, the grand jury found enough to charge the 72-year-old former wrestler with murder and involuntary manslaughter. \" it's been a long road, \" argentino's sister tells the morning call. \" they did the right thing in the face of all the evidence. \" in his 2012 autobiography, snuka, who was reportedly diagnosed with stomach cancer this month, says argentino's death ruined his life.

With fertility treatments for single women becoming increasingly common, mathilde brewaeys of the vu university medical center chose to study how children raised by 69 single mothers \" by choice \" differed from those raised by 59 mothers in heterosexual partnerships. But while there is an \" assumption that growing up in a family without a father is not good for the child, \" brewaeys found no evidence that is the case, according to a release. Brewaeys says the assumption comes from research on kids of divorce, \" who thus have experienced parental conflict. However, it seems likely that any negative influence on child development depends more on a troubled parent-child relationship and not on the absence of a father. \" that's based on questionnaires answered by moms — each with a child between 18 months and 6 years old — revealing no difference in child development, parent-child relationships, or parental stress based on family structure, per romper. However, single mothers reported wanting and having a greater support network. Interestingly, a study out last month found children of single parents had lower levels of well-being and life satisfaction as adults. ( this single mom dressed up like a dad. )",

Start with this line: griffith \" donated about 3,000 acres for a city park in 1896, shot his wife in the head in 1903, and served two years in prison for assault with a deadly weapon. \" his soon-to-be ex-wife survived, and griffith reportedly came out of san quentin a changed man. He got his inspiration to build the observatory after peering through a telescope one night — \" if all mankind could look through that telescope, it would change the world \" — and his epiphany was to put it not on some remote mountain but near the center of the city, easily accessible to all. By doing so, he played a huge role in opening up astronomy to the public, say his modern advocates. Critics, meanwhile, think he was just trying to buy back his reputation.

He may even walk away with a delegate majority, writes nate silver. A look at the landscape, from the new york times, politico, public policy polling, and the wall street journal: georgia ( 76 delegates ): newt gingrich will almost certainly win, but romney could \" win by losing, \" politico notes: a gingrich win could keep newt in the race, where he ' ll continue to siphon conservative votes from rick santorum. ( plus, romney could still take up to a third of the delegates due to distribution rules. ) ohio ( 66 delegates ): romney has been closing in on santorum here, and though the race is too close to call, some think romney's momentum will propel him to a win. Even if it does not, he will likely take the most delegates, since santorum may be ineligible for 18 of them. Tennessee ( 58 delegates ): romney is also closing in on santorum here, and an upset victory — which is possible — would be symbolically huge for him, showing he holds appeal even in the south. Virginia ( 46 delegates ): thanks to santorum and gingrich not making it on the ballot, romney will almost certainly take all the delegates ( ron paul could snatch three ). Oklahoma ( 43 delegates ): this is the state where santorum looks the strongest, and is poised to win most of the delegates; the latest polls show him with a significant advantage over romney. Massachusetts ( 41 delegates ): romney is looking at a win in his home state, but delegates are distributed proportionally so he won't take quite all of them. Idaho ( 32 delegates ): another all-but-certain romney win, thanks to the large mormon population; he ' ll likely take all the delegates. North dakota ( 28 delegates ): the open caucus means if ron paul is going to win anywhere, he's going to win here: and he's campaigning in fargo tomorrow. ( silver, however, figures the delegate distribution will be about even between santorum, romney, and paul. ) alaska ( 24 delegates ): the candidates have largely ignored the state while campaigning, except paul, who has been airing ads, has raised the most money in the state, and enjoys a strong libertarian base in the state.

        "summary": "A tremor is rippling through the us wheat industry as officials say they are investigating another crop of \" rogue \" genetically modified wheat — this one in montana. The us agriculture department announced the find friday at the same time it declared an earlier so-called \" franken-wheat \" scare in oregon an unsolved mystery, nbc news reports. The latest discovery stretches over one to three acres at a university of montana research center, beside fields where monsanto legally tested genetically herbicide-resistant wheat 11 years ago, the ap reports. Why the concern? because taiwan, south korea, and japan temporarily stopped buying western white wheat from pacific northwestern states after the oregon find last may. A us wheat growers'rep predicts no disruption this time, but an analyst tells reuters that \" some of our customers, particularly in asia \" will likely pull back and take \" a wait-and-see attitude. \" the concern is that the ge wheat — which foreign markets have banned — could mingle with nearby commercial wheat fields ( although there's little evidence that ge seeds are less safe, the ap notes ). Monsanto has alleged that detractors planted the rogue \" franken-wheat \" last time, while critics say earlier ge-wheat testing is contaminating natural crops. ( a farmer has sued monsanto over \" franken-wheat. \" )",

            "Washington ( ap ) — unregulated genetically modified wheat has popped up in a second location in the united states, this time in montana, the agriculture department said friday. No genetically engineered wheat has been approved for u.s. Farming, and the discovery of unapproved varieties can pose a potential threat to u.s. Trade with countries that have concerns about genetically modified foods. Usda said friday that the incident is on a smaller scale than a similar finding in oregon last year that prompted several asian countries to temporarily ban u.s. Wheat imports. The herbicide-resistant wheat was found on one to three acres in montana, while the genetically engineered plants found in oregon were spread over more than 100 acres. And the plants were found at a university research center in huntley, montana, where genetically modified wheat was legally tested by seed giant monsanto 11 years ago. The plants in oregon were found in a field that had never conducted such tests, prompting questions about how they got there. The department said it is investigating the discovery of the montana wheat, which is a different variety than the genetically modified wheat found in oregon. Usda said the wheat would be safe to eat, but none of it entered the market. In a final report also released friday, usda said it believes the genetically modified wheat in oregon was an isolated incident and that",

A new study says adults aged 65 and up self-reported a noticeable increase in falls between 1998 and 2010, reports eureka alert. Queried every two years, the percentage of seniors who said they'd fallen at least once in that time rose from 28 % to 36 % over the 12-year span. Researchers figured on higher fall-rates as the population ages, but lead author christine cigolle of the university of michigan says there's no connection. \" we saw a higher number of falls across all age groups — not just the oldest — and that was unexpected, \" she explains. So why the increase? maybe the elderly are engaging in riskier behavior or are reporting more honestly these days, the study says. Or maybe they're suffering side effects such as dizziness from psychiatric and cardiovascular medications. Another study of nearly 200,000 older adults found that those on atypical antipsychotics were more likely to take a serious tumble and suffer a bone fracture, medscape reports. \" these findings call into question the widespread off-label use of atypical antipsychotic medications \" like quetiapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, the study says. On the bright side, the university of michigan study found no increase in fall injuries. And experts are offering ways seniors can avoid falls, like disposing of throw rugs, lighting the path to the bathroom at night, eating and hydrating well, and boosting muscle mass and balance with proper exercise, healthday news reports.

        "summary": "Fact-checkers raked republicans over the coals during their convention, but democrats haven't exactly been squeaky clean, either. Here are some of the distortions spotted on night one of the convention: julian castro said the romney-ryan budget would \" gut pell grants. \" paul ryan's budget doesn't actually cut pell grants, though it does prevent a scheduled increase in their maximum size and make it harder to qualify for them, the washington post points out. Castro also said that 4.5 million \" new jobs \" have been created under obama. That's from an obama campaign talking point, which starts counting in february 2010, and counts only private-sector jobs — not public-sector ones, which declined. Count them, and start in 2009, and the economy has lost jobs. Castro said romney would raise taxes on the \" middle class. \" but factcheck.org points out that romney has promised not to do so — democrats are basing the statement on a study that implied he would have to. Deval patrick, romney's successor as massachusetts governor, said that by the time romney left office, the state was 47th in job creation. It was 47th overall during romney's term, but when romney left office it was 28th — up from 50th when he was elected — and as politifact notes, this stat, like many romney stats, exaggerates an executive's influence on the job market. One union president said romney had sought a \" government bailout \" for \" his company. \" but factcheck says romney actually negotiated a \" favorable but routine settlement \" with bank regulators for a company he used to work at, and that no taxpayer funds were involved.",

Joshua was unconscious when barnett pulled him from the pond, and he died later at the hospital, the bbc reports.

        "summary": "The landmark nuclear deal with iran isn't as sudden a breakthrough as it might seem. Before the geneva talks, a team of american diplomats hand-picked by president obama held at least five secret meetings with their iranian counterparts starting in march, the ap finds. The american delegations were led by deputy secretary of state william burns and jake sullivan, joe biden's top foreign policy adviser, sources tell reuters, describing how meetings in the gulf nation of oman were hushed up with the use of military planes and service elevators to conceal the presence of american diplomats. The talks were kept secret until september, when the obama administration informed israel, britain, china, france, germany, and russia that it had made significant progress. In israel, however, officials say they knew about the talks long before the us told them. \" we did not know from the beginning, but we knew, we had intelligence that these meetings were happening, \" a senior israeli minister tells buzzfeed. The us secrecy came at the price of annoying some allies. France balked when talks began, the wall street journal reports, when the us showed up with an almost complete framework that one diplomat called an \" american text. \" oman's monarch sultan qaboos played a key role in getting the \" great satan \" and an \" axis of evil \" nation to the negotiating table. He offered to help get the two sides together soon after playing a key role in securing the release of three american hikers seized after straying across the iranian border. At first, american negotiators simply sought a mechanism for continued talks, but diplomacy got a big boost after the june election of hasan rouhani. That the talks predated rouhani's election indicates that he wasn't the real architect of this deal; that would be ayatollah khamenei, the new york times points out. Khamenei indicated in march that he'd be open to talks, and one political adviser to iranian leaders says he suspects khamenei \" helped bring mr. Rouhani to power to make the public ready for a policy change. \" the us ' efforts actually reach back before march, the journal reports; they've been under way for years. John kerry has been involved since before he even became secretary of state, flying to oman in december 2011 to lay groundwork. Kerry also quietly met with his iranian counterpart on the sidelines of the un general assembly this year. The final secret us-iran meeting yielded the framework of the deal signed early yesterday but the negotiating session in geneva still went on for so long that it overlapped with saturday night parties at the city",

But it should help with the \" why me \" question from people who have \" done everything we know can be done to prevent cancer but they still get it, \" says study author bert vogelstein. Vogelstein and statistician cristian tomasetti analyzed mutations involved in 32 types of cancer to estimate that 66 % of the gene flaws are due to random copy errors. Environmental and lifestyle factors account for another 29 %, while inherited genes made up just 5 %. Which is the most common factor differs by cancer, the team says. Estimates from britain suggest 42 % of cancers are potentially preventable with a healthy lifestyle, and the hopkins team says their mutation research backs that idea.",

Other papers found in the building suggest mi6 enjoyed a far closer working relationship with gaddafi's intelligence agencies than has been publicly known, and was involved in a number of us-led operations that also resulted in islamists being consigned to gaddafi's prisons. On sunday, one of the victims, abdul hakim belhaj – now commander of the anti-gaddafi militia in tripoli – demanded an apology from london and washington and said he was considering suing over his rendition to tripoli and subsequent torture. For several years, senior mi5 and mi6 officers have sought to deny that their agencies have been guilty even of complicity in the rendition operations mounted by the us after 9/11, and the subsequent torture of",
            "\" our service has become aware that last weekend lifg deputy emir abu munthir and his spouse and children were being held in hong kong detention for immigration/passport violations. We are also aware that your service has been cooperating with the british to effect abu munthir's removal to tripoli, and that you had an aircraft available for this purpose in the maldives. Our understanding is that the hong kong special wing ( sw ) originally denied permission for your aircraft to land in hong kong to enable you to assume control of abu munthir and his family. However, we believe that the reason for the refusal was based on international concerns over having a libyan-registered aircraft land in hong kong. Accordingly, if your government were to charter a foreign aircraft from a third country, the hong kong government may be able to coordinate with you to render abu munthir and his family into your custody. If payment of a charter aircraft is an issue, our service would be willing to assist financially to help underwrite those costs. Please be advised that if we pursue that option, we must have assurances from your government that abu munthir and his family will be treated humanely and that his human rights will be respected; we must receive such assurances prior to any assistance being provided.

        "summary": "A half-century ago, researchers found two arms in the mongolian desert that clearly belonged to a big dinosaur — they were eight feet long and ended in nasty claws. But that was it, and so they named the mysterious creature deinocheirus mirificus, which roughly translates into \"unusual horrible hand, \" reports the guardian. Fifty years later, researchers have pieced together the rest, thanks mostly to the discovery of two almost complete skeletons. Deinocheirus was indeed big, on par with t-rex. But also factor in the neck of an ostrich, the bill of a duck, and something akin to the hump of a camel, reports bloomberg. \"these new specimens really solve the mystery once and for all, \" says a university of edinburgh paleontologist n national geographic. \"and they tell us deinocheirus was much weirder than anyone could have imagined — a colossal, slow-moving, horse-headed, hump-backed dinosaur that looks like something out of a bad sci-fi movie.\" it was probably a plant-eater for the most part, though it might have scooped up fish or small vertebrates when it had the chance. As for the hump, it wasn't thick like a camel's, and the best guess is that the bony spines coming off the backbone played a role in supporting the animal's massive abdomen and legs.

These people say turkish officials held al-harzi for less than a week at the behest of the u.s. Government, then sent him to tunisia. There, he was kept in military custody until last week, when he was transferred to a jail in preparation for a court trial. It's unclear what role he might have played in the attacks or what he might be charged with. The federal bureau of investigation and the u.s. Intelligence community are working with tunisian authorities, but there has been no deal yet on whether to send al-harzi to the u.s. Or keep him in tunisia where he could be charged under the country's own counterterrorism laws. The tunisians have also not yet allowed u.s. Officials direct access to the suspect. Al-harzi is a member of violent extremist networks in north africa, one u.s. Intelligence officer told the daily beast. This person added that he was also connected to jihadist organizations in the middle east and was headed to syria when he was detained in turkey. The investigation into what happened on the 11th anniversary of sept. 11 in benghazi is complicated by a number of factors. It's an election season, and republicans have accused democrats of trying to cover up a terrorist attack and misleading the public. Democrats",
            "The tunisian government has confirmed it has arrested a 28-year-old tunisian reportedly linked to the u.s. Consulate attack in libya. Tunisian interior ministry spokesman tarrouch khaled said wednesday that ali harzi was in custody in tunis. Khaled tells the associated press \" his case is in the hands of justice. \" he did not elaborate. In washington, the state department had no comment. Earlier this month, defense secretary leon panetta said the u.s. Has been looking into the arrests of two tunisian men being detained in turkey reportedly in connection with attacks on a consulate in libya last month. Ambassador j. Christopher stevens and three other americans died in the attack on the u.s. Diplomatic post in the libyan capital of benghazi on sept. 11."

But a first-of-its kind study suggests that what seems like a happy ending for both fish and fishermen isn't so great for the fish after all, reports bgr. Researchers at the university of california-riverside found that fish caught with a hook in or near the mouth have a significantly tougher time feeding afterward, they report in the journal of experimental biology. As in, the perch in the study sucked in food 34 % slower than perch caught with a net, reports discover. \"we were surprised with how dramatic the difference was, \" says lead researcher tim higham. The finding suggests that catch-and-release poses a risk to a fish's survival, but the researchers say more study is needed to determine whether this adds up to a \" significant impact on survival. \" for example, they need to figure out if feeding improves as the injury heals. Still, if the results are confirmed, it could lead to changes such as smaller hooks or the rethinking of catch-and-release practices for rare fish, per discover.

However, a new study published in the journal of experimental biology suggests that the simple act of catching a fish may be enough to doom it to death, even if it is promptly returned to the water after being de-hooked. The study focused on the damage caused by hooks in the mouths of fish that were previously caught. When hooked, the tissue around the mouth of a fish is often damaged, sometimes severely. The long-held belief that fish don't feel pain in the same way humans or some other animals do is often enough to assuage the guilt of tearing up the lip of a fish, but the study says that's not the real problem. \"using high-speed video and computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ), we asked whether injuries around the mouth caused by fishing hooks have a negative impact on suction feeding performance, \" the researchers write. \"we hypothesized that fish with mouth injuries would exhibit decreased feeding performance compared with controls. \" well, as it turns out, their hypothesis proved to be true. The suction feeding mechanism used by many fish to suck in and secure prey is indeed hampered by injuries to the mouth caused by hooks.

Those who clicked on the link found a july installment of \"the ethicist, \" the longstanding new york times magazine column taken over a little while back by chuck klosterman. The second letter in this particular installment was titled \"my wife's lover, \" and it begins with what, under the circumstances, are some pretty striking opening lines. David haglund david haglund is the literary editor of newyorker.com. \"my wife is having an affair with a government executive, \" it begins. \"his role is to manage a project whose progress is seen worldwide as a demonstration of american leadership. ( this might seem hyperbolic, but it is not an exaggeration. ) \" the letter writer goes on to explain that \"exposing the affair will create a major distraction that would adversely impact the success of an important effort, \" and to ask whether it is ok for him to \"suffer in silence for the next year or two for a project \" he believes \"must succeed, \" or whether he is obligated to acknowledge",

            "When a dear friend's teenage daughter was killed in a car accident, she understandably could not bring herself to erase her daughter's message from the family phone. That was seven years ago. My friend still hasn't changed the message, and i find it very discomforting to hear the deceased girl's voice every time i call. My friend says, ''it's all i have left. \" i want to be supportive, but i worry that preserving her daughter's voice for every caller — be it a friend or a plumber — is unhealthy. Should i say something? linda, philadelphia no, you should not. While i agree that her fixation is mildly unhealthy, your personal discomfort has no bearing on what someone else wants to use as a voice-mail message ( particularly if the content of that message provides her with even a grain of comfort ). Would you chide your friend for keeping too many photographs of her dead daughter in the living room? this message is an auditory version of a high-school picture. She may never get over the death of her daughter. Don't try to make her pretend she has. My wife's lover my wife"

And with american ripper wrapping up its eight-episode run on tuesday, we finally have an answer: the body did belong to holmes. Scientists used dental records to confirm the identity since there was no dna left to test, at least partly due to holmes ' bizarre burial request. He had asked for his coffin to be filled with concrete, buried 10 feet down, then covered with more concrete. This resulted in, among other things, his skull still sporting a perfectly preserved mustache. \" it stank, \" says one university of pennsylvania anthropologist.

        "summary": "Dementia rates are on the rise, and soon, the burden of identifying the disease may fall to primary care physicians rather than neurologists. Unfortunately, imaging tests and spinal taps are expensive, invasive, and just \" not practical, \" the mayo clinic's dr. Ronald petersen tells time. So he has come up with a new strategy: a simple, three-part test that lets doctors identify a person's risk of developing mild cognitive impairment that could progress to alzheimer's disease, the la times reports. The first step: doctors collected data on age, memory issues, family history with alzheimer's, and factors linked to the disease, like smoking and diabetes; they then reviewed basic mental exams and psychiatric evaluations. The second step: they analyzed motor function based on how fast a patient could walk a short distance. Researchers ran the test using 1,449 patients over 70 in minnesota; each factor believed to boost a person's mci risk came with a score, medical xpress reports. Patients with scores in the top 25 % were seven times more likely to develop mci than those in the bottom 25 %. By performing the first two steps for every patient over 65, petersen suggests physicians can better understand changes over time. Only if doctors notice red flags should they complete the third step: a blood analysis that could identify genetic factors, like versions of the apoe gene, linked to alzheimer's. Petersen wants to duplicate the results before recommending the strategy, but he hopes better diagnosis can lead to more participation in clinical trials of dementia drugs.

The study is published in the march 18, 2015, online issue of neurology, the medical journal of the american academy of neurology. \" our goal is to identify people who are at the highest risk for dementia as early as possible \" said study author ronald petersen, m.d., ph.d., chester and debbie cadieux director of the mayo clinic alzheimer's disease research center, cora kanow professor of alzheimer's disease research and a member of the american academy of neurology. \" early detection of individuals at high risk of developing memory and thinking problems that we call mild cognitive impairment ( mci )",
            "Diseases like alzheimer's start years, even decades, before the first symptoms of memory loss shows up. And with rates of those diseases rising, experts say that more primary care physicians — not neurology experts — will have the task of identifying these patients early so they can take advantage of whatever early interventions might be available. \"if we had a simple blood test, a cholesterol test for alzheimer's disease, that would help, \" says dr. Ronald petersen, director of the alzheimer's disease research center at the mayo clinic, \"but we don't. \" but petersen has a potential solution, and according to a new paper released wednesday in the journal neurology, his alzheimer's test has promise. Petersen and his team wanted to develop a test that any physician can administer to patients, without the need for any new technology or expensive equipment."
