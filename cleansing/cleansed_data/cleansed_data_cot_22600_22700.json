        "summary": "Men make up the lion's share of homicide victims, but it's women who \" pay the highest price as a result of gender inequality, discrimination, and negative stereotypes. \" that's according to a new un report out of its office on drugs and crime, abc news reports, and it contains some sobering stats. The key finding: of the 87,000 women killed globally in 2017, 58 % died at the hands of either a romantic partner or family member, which comes out to about 137 women per day, or six or so per hour. The report, which looked at homicide data worldwide through the lens of gender-related killings, was released in tandem with sunday's international day for the elimination of violence against women. Women are most at risk of being killed by someone known to them in africa, which claims a rate of about 3.1 victims per every 100,000 females, followed by the americas, with a rate of 1.6. The risk is lowest for women in europe, where the rate is 0.7. The study says that not enough has been done to both prevent and respond to such crimes, noting that there hasn't been \" tangible progress \" on this front even with programs and laws set up to combat violence against women. \" targeted criminal justice responses are needed to prevent and end gender-related killings, \" says unodc executive director yury fedotov. The study suggests improvements in health and social systems, getting police and the justice system to work together better, and educating men early on how they can help.

This version has been updated with a more diverse cast and a bit more humor, but otherwise it's pretty much the same. Here's what critics are saying: richard roeper sums it up like this for the chicago sun-times: the magnificent seven is a \" rousing, albeit sometimes cheesy, action-packed western bolstered by denzel washington's baddest-of-the-baddasses lead performance, mostly fine supporting work, and yep, some of the most impressively choreographed extended shootout sequences in recent memory. \" however, \" peter sarsgaard wildly overplays his role \" as villain and chris pratt is \" underwhelming. \" fuqua and his multicultural cast succeed in \" updating the story with the crackle of the contemporary without sacrificing the basic plot's lean, compelling simplicity, \" writes cary darling at dfw.com. \" the final, very violent confrontation — which takes up much of the back half of the film — is dizzyingly well-choreographed \" and \" washington's commanding presence helps elevate what otherwise might be ordinary. \" there's \" not much dramatic tension of good versus bad \" due to the pacing of the villainous sarsgaard's appearances, but the film still does justice to the original, writes soren andersen at the seattle times. It's a \" highly enjoyable picture, packed with sweeping western vistas and massive quantities of gunplay, \" he adds. \" count this one as a guilty pleasure. \" tirdad derakhshani, however, was \" sorely disappointed. \" yes, the flick is \" supremely competent, enjoyable, even gleefully fun \" but it's also \" largely forgettable, \" derakhshani writes at the philadelphia inquirer. While the makers of the 1960 film produced \" a creative reconfiguration and reinterpretation \" of seven samurai, fuqua and his team simply \" parrot. \" at least washington is \" brilliant. \"",

        "summary": "A suspect has been nabbed in an arkansas road-rage case that left a 3-year-old boy dead last week. Confirmation comes via the us marshals that gary holmes was arrested in connection with the murder of acen king, who was killed after a man shot at the car he was riding in on monday with his grandmother at the wheel, kthv reports. Cops say holmes, 33, surrendered to little rock police on thursday after his parents and us marshals hashed it out with him so he'd turn himself in without incident, the new york daily news reports. Holmes was booked at the pulaski county jail and charged with capital murder and making a terroristic act. In the incident that killed acen, holmes reportedly didn't like how long acen's grandmother was lingering at a stop sign and honked his horn at her; he allegedly got out of his vehicle and fired at her car after she honked back. She hit the gas and rushed away to a jcpenney parking lot, which is when she discovered acen had been shot in the back seat. Holmes, who could be looking at the death penalty, has been in trouble with the law before, including for domestic battery. Acen's death is said to be the 40th homicide in the city this year, per arkansas online. A gofundme page set up for acen's parents — who \" weren't prepared for this, \" per the family member who created it — has so far raised $ 3,800 of a $ 10,000 goal.

Now a university college london professor has used data from space-track.org to create a video to help us visualize how quickly that space junk has accumulated thanks to space traffic and collisions, reports wired uk. Nasa notes that there have been few disastrous collisions, but it points to two recent ones — a chinese missile test in 2007 and the collision of two satellites in 2009 — that threw 5,000 items of debris into orbit. In his video, lecturer stuart grey first takes us back to 1957, with the launch of sputnik 1 and the space race, reports the orlando sentinel. The few minor objects multiply rapidly, and he has to pan out to view the entire array. Nasa says it works with the department of defense to maintain a \" highly accurate satellite catalog on objects in earth orbit that are larger than a softball, \" and houston and moscow mission controls work together to help avoid debris \" encounters. \" so far, no practical way of cleaning up the junk has emerged, notes cnet.

The huffington post reports outside magazine published an \" obituary \" for the reef on tuesday, giving 2016 as the year it died. And while the article may have had its heart in the right place, coral scientists worry that it will do more harm than good for the great barrier reef, which is still very much alive and in need of saving. That's especially a concern as the story has gone viral, garnering misleading headlines like \" great barrier reef pronounced dead by scientists. \" \"if there's nothing that can be done, let's not do anything and move onto other issues, \" noaa's russell brainard worries people will think. And the great barrier reef could very much benefit from people not moving on to other issues. Recent coral bleaching impacted 93 % of the reef, killing 20 % of it this year, thinkprogress reports. According to the telegraph, fewer fish are living in the reef, and climate change continues to be a threat. It may not be dead, but one scientist says the great barrier reef is \" on life support. \" still, a recent study showed dead portions of reefs can come back if they're protected. Coral scientist terry hughes says a better message would be to let people know that it's not too late if we join together to fight for the great barrier reef.

        "summary": "Ever wonder why flamingos stand on one leg? so did two georgia scientists, and their research has found the birds appear to expend less energy when they do so, the bbc reports. A study published in the biology letters journal examined both live and dead flamingos and explains how living ones appear to put out no active muscle effort while on one leg, but need that active muscle force when on two. When study co-authors young-hui chang of georgia tech and emory university's lena ting headed to atlanta's zoo, they even noticed that as flamingos dozed off while teetering on one leg, they seemed to become more stable, not less, per the atlantic, which also offers an explainer about why the birds ' legs seem to bend in funny directions. Chang and ting examined two euthanized flamingos, and that's when they had what chang says was their \" lightbulb moment. \" they discovered they could even make these erstwhile flamingos stand on one leg with zero outside support, thanks to what they call a \" passive gravitational stay mechanism \" that's achievable if the leg is bent at a particular angle. Trying to switch the cadavers to a sustainable two-legged pose didn't work. The position necessary to achieve the one-legged stance isn't some locking of the joints, either: chang notes that there's a lock in one direction, but \" flexibility \" in the other, when the pose is engaged. \" we call it a'stay ' rather than a ' lock, ' \" he tells the bbc. \" it's more akin to a doorstop. \" another researcher not involved in the study notes this research partly answers the how, but not the when, where, or why of this feat, with his own team suspecting the birds may do so to conserve heat.

            "Conservatives and republicans today suffered their most crushing legislative defeat since the 1960s. It's hard to exaggerate the magnitude of the disaster. Conservatives may cheer themselves that they ' ll compensate for today's expected vote with a big win in the november 2010 elections. But: ( 1 ) it's a good bet that conservatives are over-optimistic about november – by then the economy will have improved and the immediate goodies in the healthcare bill will be reaching key voting blocs. ( 2 ) so what? legislative majorities come and go. This healthcare bill is forever. A win in november is very poor compensation for this debacle now. So far, i think a lot of conservatives will agree with me. Now comes the hard lesson: a huge part of the blame for today's disaster attaches to conservatives and republicans ourselves. At the beginning of this process we made a strategic decision: unlike, say, democrats in 2001 when president bush proposed his first tax cut, we would make no deal with the administration. No negotiations, no compromise, nothing. We were going for all the marbles. This would be obama's waterloo – just as healthcare was clinton's in 1994. Only, the hardliners overlooked a few key facts: obama was elected with 53 % of the vote, not clinton's 42 %. The liberal block within the democratic congressional caucus is bigger and stronger than it was in 1993-94. And of course the democrats also remember their history, and also remember the consequences of their 1994 failure. This time, when we went for all the marbles, we ended with none. Could a deal have been reached? who knows? but we do know that the gap between this plan and traditional republican ideas is not very big. The",

Several israeli officials have lashed out at the us, report cnn and the ap, following new leaks friday that the nsa had spied on four israeli offices — including the prime minister's. \" this thing is not legitimate and not acceptable to us, \" israel's intelligence minister said, given the \" unprecedented \" intelligence alliance the us and israel share. \" it's quite embarrassing, \" agreed the tourism minister, calling for the release of jonathan pollard, an american jailed for life for passing information to israel. But the jerusalem post notes that benjamin netanyahu, his predecessors, and the foreign ministry have kept quiet since friday's report, a \" deafening \" silence that yonah jeremy bob attributes to that tight intelligence alliance; there have been reports of israel helping the nsa snoop on others. In other nsa news: friday's reports also revealed that a host of humanitarian programs, including unicef, the un's development program, and france's medecins du monde were targeted. The leaks came, of course, from edward snowden's master cache. Snowden spoke up recently to slam the presidential advisory panel calling for reforms to the nsa's program, the wall street journal reports. \" their job wasn't to protect privacy or deter abuses, \" snowden said. \" it was to 'restore public confidence. ' \" the senate judiciary committee has announced a special session to hear testimony from that panel, the guardian reports, in an attempt by chair patrick leahy to bring attention to the issue. \" momentum is building for real reform, \" leahy said.",

        "summary": "The image of a \" ferocious-looking \" tyrannosaurus rex with a \" permanent smile \" of huge protruding teeth is taking a hit thanks to one canadian paleontologist, live science reports. Robert reisz says the t. Rex, along with other theropods, actually had scaly lips covering its teeth. \"when we see dinosaurs in popular culture, such as in the movie jurassic park, we see them depicted with big teeth sticking out of their mouths, \" reisz says in a press release, but he believes that isn't so. The key is enamel, which theropods'teeth were known to be covered in. Enamel needs to be kept hydrated, the guardian reports. Otherwise, teeth dry out and become brittle. \" if you have your teeth sticking out, you can't hydrate the enamel, \" reisz says. \" you can't maintain it properly. \" but wait, you say, crocodiles — a relative of dinosaurs — have teeth sticking out of their mouth. Reisz says that's because crocodiles live in the water, which provides the necessary hydration. Before you start picturing a t. Rex with mick jagger's lips, cnn points out that seeing lips on dinosaurs isn't so unusual. For example, the famous velociraptors from jurassic park hid their teeth behind lips. But as for t. Rex, paleontologist zhijie jack tseng isn't so convinced. In comments to live science, he notes that theropods didn't need to worry about tooth quality as much as you might expect because dinosaurs could rapidly replace their teeth. \" t. Rex could chip a tooth or get one stuck in prey, and just replace it. Evolving protection for teeth is not a critical component of how they eat. \" ( for t. Rex, size originally didn't matter. )",

That's what brandon s., 23, has been doing since he started working for google in may, the washington post reports. Brandon got a taste of bay area rental prices during a summer 2014 internship with the company: he told business insider he spent roughly $ 65 a night on the cheapest corporate housing option, a four-person, 2-bedroom place. But he did little but sleep there, eating three ( free ) meals on google's campus, where he also worked out and showered. After debating the pros ( proximity, money savings ) and cons ( \" social suicide, \" upfront costs ), he bought a 16-foot 2006 box truck with 128 square feet of indoor space and 157,000 miles on the odometer. It cost $ 10,000; he pays $ 121 a month for insurance and has installed amenities like a bed, dresser, clothes rack, and bike rack. He says google security hasn't bothered him beyond cross-checking the truck's registration file with the company database. Brandon has a running tally on his blog as to how much he has saved by not spending what he estimated would be $ 2,180 a month in rent. This week he broke even and then crossed into profitable territory. He's saving money on food, too: he doesn't want to keep any in the truck for fear of a rodent infestation, so he still eats most meals on the google campus. He tells business insider he's trying to spend only 10 % of his after-tax income, putting the rest toward student loan debt and investments. But there are certainly some no-fun aspects of his living situation, like battling bugs. ( a female software engineer is also creatively dodging high rents. )",

        "summary": "As of now, the ontario county sheriff in upstate new york doesn't expect to file charges against nascar's tony stewart after he struck and killed a fellow driver at a dirt-track event saturday night, reports the rochester democrat and chronicle. The investigation is continuing into the death of 20-year-old kevin ward, but the sheriff says he sees nothing to suggest that stewart acted criminally. However, he's again asking that witnesses send in whatever photos and videos they have, reports the ap. Investigators also are reconstructing the accident, taking into account track conditions and the dim lighting. In the incident, stewart sent ward's car spinning into the wall, and ward then walked onto the track to confront stewart. Though one car swerved to avoid ward, stewart fishtailed into him. Ward's actions may sound nuts to non-racing fans, but as the new york times reports, it's not that uncommon. In fact, stewart himself did much the same in incidents in 2012 and 1999. Ward's death has triggered a debate about the macho culture of racing, and one quote from driver tyler graves in sporting news is getting heavy traction: \" i know tony could see him. I know how you can see out of these cars. When tony got close to him, he hit the throttle. When you hit a throttle on a sprint car, the car sets sideways. It set sideways, the right rear tire hit kevin, kevin was sucked underneath and was stuck under it for a second or two, and then it threw him about 50 yards. \" sure, racing deaths happen, but this is \" unprecedented \" in that it \" arose from the event, and transpired in the middle of the contest, \" writes john walters at newsweek. He says it's \" ridiculous \" to think that stewart meant to hurt ward, but he adds that neither driver \" exercised enough caution. \" both he and mike lupica at the daily news use the phrase \" road rage \" in their write-ups. The question for prosecutors is whether stewart deserves any punishment.",

It didn't really work — today they have just 10 % cow dna and no discernible cow features.

Louisiana, new jersey, and north carolina each have 100 cities that could be doomed. The guardian explains that those 1,400 locations represent ones where 50 % of the current population \" lives below the locked-in future high-tide level. \" the dates given in the study detail when the cities would be past the \" point of no return, \" not actually underwater, notes the guardian. And some big-name locations are already there. \" even if we could just stop global emissions tomorrow on a dime, fort lauderdale, miami gardens, hoboken, nj, will be under sea level, \" study author benjamin strauss, a scientist at climate central, tells the guardian. Averting the sea-level rise will require emission cuts much deeper than anything politicians are currently considering, he says.",

        "summary": "When alaska teen kaleena pysher learned she was pregnant at 18, she knew firsthand what it would take to have a baby so young — her sister had a child at 14 — and decided adoption was best. The now-19-year-old wanted to give her child good parents and a good education, something she felt she couldn't do, and when she learned a former babysitter was looking to adopt, she knew she had found the right fit. She spent her pregnancy sending the adoptive parents updates. \" i would tell them, ' oh, she has the hiccups today, ' or,'she's moving around a lot today, ' \" pysher tells today parents. But there was something else the teen wanted to give: breast milk. After learning from a home health nurse that \" when a baby is fed breast milk, they are just way ahead of the game \" she realized she wanted to pump and mail the milk to the baby girl. Raylie brooke ( pysher got to choose the middle name ) was born in november, and pysher held her for much of the first 48 hours. But she let her go after 2 days, wanting the baby to bond with her new parents, and spent the next 2 months suffering through cracked and bleeding nipples to pump. \" i just sucked it up and kept going, \" pysher tells alaska dispatch news. Her supply was huge — at one point she was pumping 12 ounces every 2 hours — and one shipment hit 80 pounds. She's now down to pumping twice a day and plans to donate her extra supply to a milk bank in colorado ( alaska doesn't have one ) that sends it to a nicu. She expresses worry about losing touch: \" as long as i ' m still giving them breast milk, they still need me for something. [ the baby ] still needs me. But now that i ' m tapering off... \" but the adoptive parents assure pysher that there will be birthday visits and video chats in the years ahead. ( another touching story: a man's wife left him, but he won't give up his baby with down syndrome. )",

Jeff miller, who proposed the bill, says the funds would help compensate nearly 1,400 veterans of the iraq and afghanistan wars who suffered the \" loss or loss of use of creative organs \" in injuries to their pelvises, groins, or spinal cords, reports the military times. Others are infertile because of paralysis or a traumatic brain injury. Though the two payments of $ 10,000 are to be \" used at the veteran's discretion, \" they would assist families in getting medical treatments like in vitro fertilization or paying adoption fees, says miller, the republican chairman of the house veterans ' affairs committee, per sunshine state news. However, sen. Patty murray, a democrat, says miller's bill \" falls far short of covering the care a veteran and their spouse needs to fulfill their dreams of starting a family, \" murray says. Fertility services including ivf are covered for some injured troops on active duty, but not always for veterans. For example, veteran affairs doesn't cover the cost of ivf ( about $ 12,000 per cycle ) for the spouses of veterans. That's something matt and tracy keil learned after matt was shot in the spine in iraq and left paralyzed from the neck down. \" finding out that ivf wouldn't be covered because we agreed to retire out so quickly, that was hard, \" tracy keil told npr in february. \" don't tell me that his service wasn't good enough for us to have a chance at a family.

        "summary": "The united nations is warning about a possible humanitarian crisis after increased violence against a muslim ethnic minority in myanmar. With the government claiming the rohingya people are migrants from bangladesh with no citizenship rights, security forces in the country have killed hundreds and destroyed their villages, reports the new york times. More than 120,000 rohingya people have fled the country for bangladesh in the last two weeks as a result. Another 400,000 rohingya are trapped in conflict zones in western myanmar, reports the guardian. More: eleven nobel peace prize laureates \" warned of the potential for genocide \" in myanmar in an open letter last year. The recent rise in violence came in response to rohingya militants killing 12 security forces in an attack on a military base late last month. The myanmar military says it responded by killing 370 rohingya fighters, but the exact death toll remains unclear. The ap reports more than 400 have been killed, while the times notes 46 rohingya died last week while trying to cross a river separating myanmar and bangladesh. Those who've escaped alive describe helicopters raining gunfire on western myanmar's rakhine state, where 1 million rohingya people live and have lived for centuries. The guardian reports un agencies, accused by the government on conspiring with the rohingya, are barred from delivering aid. The move not only shows \" a callous disregard for human life \" but puts rakhine state \" on the precipice of a humanitarian disaster, \" says amnesty international. The european union has demanded full humanitarian access in myanmar. It also promised tuesday to provide aid in bangladesh, where border camps are already bursting, per the ap. The bbc says 35,000 people have arrived in the last 24 hours. In response to the \" deadly exodus, \" migrant offshore aid station, which has helped some 40,000 refugees reach europe since 2014, has also moved operations from the libyan coast to the bay of bengal. Editors at the guardian, who describe myanmar's actions as \" almost genocidal, \" point out the \" horrible irony \" in the involvement of nobel peace prize laureate aung san suu kyi.

Henry soto and greg blauert say microsoft failed to warn them about the dangers of the job and failed to provide psychological support. They sued the company in king county court on dec. 30, alleging negligence, disability discrimination and violations of the consumer protection act. The men were customer service workers assigned to microsoft's online safety program, responsible for deciding whether content should be removed or reported to law enforcement. They say they never were told about dangerous psychological impacts of the job, which included viewing child pornography, and were not allowed to turn down the assignment. \"plaintiffs henry soto and greg blauert were not warned about the likely dangerous impact of reviewing the depictions nor were they warned they may become so concerned with the welfare of the children, they would not appreciate the harm the toxic images would cause them and their families, \" they say in the complaint. Instead of providing trained therapists for the safety team, microsoft developed a \"wellness program \" that advised employees who were disturbed by images to take \"walks and smoking breaks \" and redirect thoughts by playing video games, the men say.

            "Seattle ( cn ) — two microsoft employees who had to watch \"horrific images \" of murder, child pornography and bestiality as part of their \"online safety \" job have sued the company after developing post-traumatic stress disorder. Henry soto and greg blauert say microsoft failed to warn them about the dangers of the job and failed to provide psychological support. They sued the company in king county court on dec. 30, alleging negligence, disability discrimination and violations of the consumer protection act. The men were customer service workers assigned to microsoft's online safety program, responsible for deciding whether content should be removed or reported to law enforcement. They say they never were told about dangerous psychological impacts of the job, which included viewing child pornography, and were not allowed to turn down the assignment. \"plaintiffs henry soto and greg blauert were not warned about the likely dangerous impact of reviewing the depictions nor were they warned they may become so concerned with the welfare of the children, they would not appreciate the harm the toxic images would cause them and their families, \" they say in the complaint. Instead of providing trained therapists for the safety team, microsoft developed a \"wellness program \" that advised employees who were disturbed by images to take \"walks and smoking breaks \" and redirect thoughts by playing video games, the men say. Soto says",

A round-up: politico's list of debate details notes that it is scheduled to start at 9pm edt at longwood university in farmville, va., and last for 90 minutes. Elaine quijano of cbs news will be the moderator. To prepare, pence has been debating wisconsin gov. Scott walker, while washington attorney robert barnett has been working with kaine. The two men are so overshadowed by their running mates that this will be \" one of the least consequential vice-presidential debates ever staged, \" according to the guardian. With trump's recent stumbles, pence is likely to be under more pressure than kaine. \" if pence does well, he can stop the bleeding and set up trump for sunday night. If pence is mediocre or is seen to have lost, it will be a long few weeks for trump, \" says lanhee chen, a hoover institution research fellow who helped mitt romney prepare for the 2012 debates. The hill lists five things to watch for, including efforts by kaine to defend clinton's record and by pence to shift the conversation away from trump's tax returns. Politico reports that pence blasted kaine's record as governor of virginia during a speech in the state monday, but signaled that he plans to spend most of his time targeting clinton. \" clinton's record on foreign affairs alone could take up the whole 90 minutes, \" he said. \" and it wouldn't be a pretty picture. \" the washington post takes a look at what makes running for vice president such a \" terrible job \" — and it includes the \" nationally televised gaffe obstacle course known as the vice-presidential debate. \" viewers won't be casting their vote based on the debate, the post notes, but they ' ll be looking out for blunders and for moments like lloyd bentsen's famous \" you're no jack kennedy \" line to dan quayle.

        "summary": "After rapidly rising for three decades, obesity rates in the us are apparently stabilizing — finally, the los angeles times reports. New data shows just a slight rise in obesity rates since 2005, and many experts say this flattening reflects the success of efforts such as healthier school lunches and nutritional information on food packages. Of course, as one nutrition expert notes, \" the bad news is we still have obesity rates that are just astronomical. \" specifically, 35.7 % of american adults were considered obese in 2010. And rates did rise over the same period among specific groups, including black women and mexican-american women, notes the times. The washington post looks at the data and asks a question: if anti-obesity efforts are working, then why a stabilization rather than a drop in rates? time speaks to a cdc director who offers this answer: the trend may be similar to what happened after anti-smoking efforts were launched in the 1950s. In that case, it took more than 10 years to begin to see a decline in smoking rates. \" nutrition programs and physical activity efforts have only just begun to kick in, and haven't had much time to operate. It takes time before the effects of policy change begin to show benefit in terms of behavior changes, \" he says.",

In 2010, about 35.7 % of u.s. Adults — nearly 78 million people — were obese. That's up from 30.5 % in 2000, but not much of a difference from 33.7 % in 2008. Does that mean our attempts at healthy living — giving up the french fries and sodas, and logging endless miles on the treadmill — have been for nothing? not quite. Public health experts say that it may be too soon to see an actual decline in obesity rates, since the nation's efforts to slim down began relatively recently. And while it would be encouraging to see obesity rates in the u.s. Start to dip, experts say the current data are still inspiring — at least the u.s. Isn't getting fatter overall.

        "summary": "In the days after mosul fell to isis, 40 indian construction workers who'd been on assignment on the mosul university campus were kidnapped. Only one, harjit masih, managed to survive after what he says were four days in captivity in june 2014. He was shot in the thigh; the rest, he says, got bullets, mostly to the head. Npr reports the indian government had for years countered that, maintaining some could still be alive. Proof to the contrary has now come: the ap reports that a dirt mound outside the village of badush that had been a rumored mass grave used by isis has turned out to be so. Iraqi authorities began excavating there in the summer after radar indicated there were human remains within, and they unearthed not just those remains. They also found id cards, what npr calls \" non-iraqi shoes, \" and karas, the silver bracelets sikhs wear. Dna analysis has now led to 38 positive identifications, with the last one pending. \" with full proof i can say these 39 are dead, \" sushma swaraj, india's foreign minister, said tuesday. Iraq's forensic director says the men were indeed shot, and that the condition of their remains indicated they'd been buried for a long period, though he didn't offer a date. India's ambassador to iraq says the bodies will be returned home in the coming weeks. The guardian notes swaraj caught flak over the government's delay in declaring the men dead. Her defense: \" it would have been a sin had we handed over anybody's body claiming it to be those of our people, just for the sake of closing files. \"",

Considering jackson's well-documented quest for perfection, michael felt like an affront to his legacy, a shoddy attempt to take money from fans and build on his massive estate."

So report johns hopkins university researchers in the journal radiology after they combed through the results of a longitudinal study following nearly 3,000 men and women for, on average, nearly a decade. It turns out that the heart muscle around the left ventricle — which pumps blood throughout the body — grew larger and thicker over time in men, while in women it tended to stay the same or get smaller. Over time, its volume also decreased more in women than in men, which they call a \" fascinating discrepancy. \" says a senior researcher: \" our results are a striking demonstration of the concept that heart disease may have different pathophysiology in men and women, and of the need for tailored treatments that address such important biologic differences. \" it's the first long-term study that uses mri scans to observe the structure and function of the left ventricle, and because women are so rarely included in heart research, it's the first to observe these differences, notes live science. ( just last year, the national institutes of health announced a policy shift requiring that any studies it funds use both male and female cells, which is in addition to earlier requirements that women be included in clinical trials, reports vice. ) another researcher says their findings pose a host of new questions: \" treatments related to the shape changes may have to be different — like treatment for heart failure might have to be different for men and women.

But the contraction was not quite as much as economists had been expecting. Concern over the weakness of the economy and the deficit have driven up the cost of borrowing for spain, raising fears it will need a bailout.

A report in the financial times on monday said that the spanish government is considering helping the banking industry by allowing them to put bad loans into a government-organised fund. But according to the report it is not clear how much benefit the scheme will have, as government officials say banks will have to match the bad loans deposited with provisions for that debt on their own balance sheets.

            "Image caption protesters across spain demonstrated against cuts in healthcare and education on sunday the spanish economy is officially in recession, according to the latest figures. The national statistics institute said the economy shrank 0.3 % over the three months to the end of march, the second consecutive quarterly contraction. But the contraction was not quite as much as economists had been expecting. Concern over the weakness of the economy and the deficit have driven up the cost of borrowing for spain, raising fears it will need a bailout. Separately, standard and poor's downgraded the credit ratings of nine spanish banks, including santander and bbva. A report in the financial times on monday said that the spanish government is considering helping the banking industry by allowing them to put bad loans into a government-organised fund. But according to the report it is not clear how much benefit the scheme will have, as government officials say banks will have to match the bad loans deposited with provisions for that debt on their own balance sheets. Meanwhile, many spaniards are affected by the crisis. On friday the government said that unemployment hit a record in march of 24.4 %.

Smith-kramer died later at a hospital, while anderson was released from the hospital sunday with a bruised lung and cracked sternum.

        "summary": "Kali hardig, 12, went swimming in a little rock, ark., lake earlier this month — and, in a nightmare scenario, she's now battling a brain-eating parasite. Naegleria fowleri is a microscopic amoeba that gets to the brain through the nose, typically infecting people who go swimming in freshwater, cnn reports. But it's very rare and very deadly: \" ninety-nine percent of people who get it die, \" says a health department official with the state, which has seen just five confirmed cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis between 1962 and 2012. Cnn identifies a sandy-bottomed lake at willow springs water park as the likely source of kali's infection. Another case was linked to the water park in 2010, and the department of health has asked the park to shut down; it complied. The girl's mom tells the christian post, \" i couldn't get her fever down. She started vomiting. She'd say her head hurt really bad. She cried, and she would just look at me and her eyes would just kind of roll. \" kali was admitted to the hospital on july 19 and put into a medically-induced coma. Her mom tells fox 16 she wants to raise awareness of the importance of nose clips while swimming in rivers or lakes. She is confident kali will beat the odds, but abc news notes that just one of the 128 people infected with naegleria fowleri in the us over the last five decades survived. ( swimming proved deadly for another girl — though for a much different reason — last week. )",

A photo making the rounds shows housing authority worker jose rivera minutes after he speared the humongous rodent with a pitchfork at the marcy houses. It's covered in white fur and looks well-fed.

Some reactions to microsoft's preview of windows 10, which will run on a wide range of devices, with apps sold from a single store: the start menu — whose absence was one of the most jarring changes seen in windows 8 — is being welcomed back. \" it is critically important, \" a tech consultant tells the bbc. \" the start menu is perhaps the most important thing that will make the desktop experience familiar to business users, and will help reduce resistance to its installation. \" multitasking appears to have been made easier, with a new task view feature that displays open files and apps and can be used on multiple desktops. This \" worked seamlessly and we were able to quickly and easily switch between multiple applications, \" writes karissa bell at mashable. The system appears designed to please both windows 8 users and the many people who didn't bother upgrading from windows 7. \" the new experience is certainly familiar to windows 7 users, but still seems to provide access to the best of the windows 8 capabilities, \" an analyst tells computerworld. \" of course in the end we will need to see — and use — the experience on a broad set of devices to really understand how well it works. \" the system will be available sometime in the middle of next year, microsoft says, and some features have yet to be unveiled, reports the daily dot. But one analyst tells the guardian that skipping windows 9 may mess up the hit-then-miss pattern of windows launches: \" every other windows launch hasn't worked for them, \" he says. \" we had vista, which was a dud, then we had windows 7, which was great, then we had windows 8. \"",

Un secretary-general ban ki-moon has called for an immediate ceasefire, saying an israeli ground offensive would be a \" dangerous escalation, \" reuters reports. The us has also warned against a ground assault, though an administration spokesman says the us believes \" israel will make its own decisions about the military operations and decisions that it undertakes. \" israel says plans for a ground offensive are \" on hold \" to give truce talks with hamas a chance of success, reports the bbc. \" before deciding on a ground invasion, the prime minister intends to exhaust the diplomatic move in order to see if a long-term ceasefire can be achieved, \" a senior israeli official says. Hamas leader khaled meshaal told reporters that since israel began hostilities with the assassination of military chief ahmed jabari last week, it must be the first to end military operations, the guardian reports. \" a ground invasion will not be a walk in the park, \" he warned. \" we don't have the same military and deterrence capabilities but we have deterred them with our will.

Both men made the news around the same time. On monday, nbc announced that williams would be suspended for six months without pay. The long-serving news anchor had admitted to \" misremembering \" his involvement in the downing of a us helicopter during the iraq war in 2003, and giving a misleading account of coming under fire. The same day, comedian and daily show host jon stewart surprised his studio audience, saying he was moving off the satirical show. \" when god closes a door he opens a window, right? \" said one twitter user, echoing many others. \" maybe #brianwilliams should take over for jon stewart on the @thedailyshow? \" the jokes of social media are, in fact",
            "Jon stewart announced his retirement tuesday — he ' ll step down at some point this year from the the daily show. Comedy central has reportedly confirmed that it will continue the show without stewart. Jessica williams after more than 15 years of stewart, and three years of craig kilborn before him, it's high time the show breaks down the late-night boys club and hires a lead anchor that is not another straight, white, and male comic. There's plenty to pick from in the wake of stewart's departure, from seasoned correspondents to all sorts of interesting comedians. Here are seven badass options. Pros: she's the name on every tumblr user's lips in terms of a replacement. She's had several breakout correspondent moments since joining the show, and can further connect the series to a younger demographic. Cons: she's still very young, and not the most senior woman on the show right now. She hasn't been tested in the anchor position yet, so it's a gamble. Samantha bee she's got years of experience on the show, and even some behind the desk during a recent stewart sick day.

        "summary": "The supreme court has finished hearing the arguments in the proposition 8 case, and prognosticators are busy reading the tea leaves for what it might be thinking. Here's what went down: ruth bader ginsberg, elena kagan, sonia sotomayor, and, perhaps surprisingly, john roberts, peppered charles cooper, the lead attorney for proposition 8, with questions about whether california voters had the authority to appeal a lower court ruling blocking prop 8, usa today reports. Antonin scalia and samuel alito came out sounding \" very hostile to the idea of the court imposing same-sex marriage, \" cnn's legal analyst says, and they were consistently the voices in favor of the same-sex marriage ban. Perpetual swing voter anthony kennedy seemed focused on the harm banning same-sex marriage might have on the children of gay couples. \" the voice of the children is important, don't you think? \" he asked. But scalia countered that having same-sex parents might be harmful to children in the first place. At one point, cooper argued that procreation was a vital state interest, and that same-sex couples don't address it, the washington post reports. Elena kagan replied by asking if, in that case, the state shouldn't allow marriages of people over age 55. \" i assure you, \" she said, \" if both the man and the woman are over 55, there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage. \" clarence thomas, as usual, said nothing. Prognosis of tom goldstein at scotusblog: the court doesn't have the wherewithal to strike down or uphold prop 8, with kennedy seemingly uneasy with either position; he was \" deeply concerned \" that the court could be acting prematurely, with the relative newness of same-sex marriage. Goldstein thinks either roberts will join the liberal justices in declaring that the state doesn't have the standing to appeal, or the justices will fail to reach a majority. Either way, lower court rulings against prop 8 would stand, but nationally the issue would remain up in the air. Theodore olson, one of the high-profile lawyers arguing for marriage equality, had a different take. Asked if the justices would make a broad ruling, he replied, \" based upon the questions that the justices asked \" — here he paused briefly for effect — \" i have no idea. \"",

And that includes \" a failed attempt to bomb times square by a pakistani-american in 2010 that the nypd did not stop. \" what's more, the nypd doesn't seem to have played a big role in most of the busts. \" in several cases, it played no role at all. \" see the full article and a breakdown of the 14 cases here.
