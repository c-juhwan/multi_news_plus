        "summary": "More than two dozen women are accusing a celebrity chef and his business partner of fostering a mad men-type atmosphere they say was overrun by \" kitchen bros. \" an eight-month probe by the times-picayune found 25 current and past employees who document sexual harassment while working at john besh's besh restaurant group, either for one of the new orleans chef's restaurants or for corporate. The women allege female workers were victims of unwanted touching and remarks by male colleagues, and that some co-workers tried to use their power to convince women to have sex — and that when complaints were made, they went nowhere. One woman says she was pressured into a \" months-long \" sexual relationship with besh himself, and that when she tried to stop it, others retaliated. Two related eeoc complaints have been filed against the company since december. In a statement, besh, a 49-year-old married dad, acknowledges a \" consensual relationship \" with a team member. \" i alone am entirely responsible for my moral failings, \" he says, though he denies fostering sexual harassment. A brg rep says the company never received any internal sexual harassment complaints; an hr director just started working there earlier this month. Eater reports on sexual harassment stats in the restaurant industry, with one 2014 study reporting such harassment is \" widespread. \" in a separate statement, a brg attorney says the company has \" revamped our training, education, and procedures accordingly \" after hearing the women's complaints. Other fallout: harrah's new orleans casino has since broken ties with besh's company, and a top chef with besh's group says he was fired after speaking out about the company culture ( though some women say he didn't help matters ).",

Officials say the military is going from floor to floor and room to room in the darkened building searching for surviving militants, the los angeles times reports. Somalia's al-shabab militant group tweeted early today that its fighters \" are still holding their ground \" and their captives are \" still alive, looking quite disconcerted but, nevertheless, alive. \" in other developments: kenya's foreign minister told pbs newshour last night that two or three americans were involved in the attack. She said they were of arab or somali origin, 18 or 19 years old, and had lived \" in minnesota and one other place \" in the us. She said a british woman who had \" done this many times before \" was also involved, contradicting another minister's statement that all the attackers were men. Security officials and soldiers told reuters that a white woman was among the attackers killed, though they couldn't confirm whether she was samantha lewthwaite, the al-shabab-linked widow of a british terrorist. The state department says that it is investigating reports that americans were involved, but \" at this point we have no definitive evidence of the nationalities or identities of the perpetrators, \" the washington post reports. Witnesses say most of the attackers were young and shouted to each other in english. British officials say they will not discuss the identity of the attackers while the investigation continues, reports the bbc. Officials say at least six attackers have been killed and around 10 more captured. The civilian body count stands at 62, but the red cross says 63 people are still unaccounted for. In minnesota, home to america's largest somali community, muslim leaders refused to comment on reports that somali americans were involved in the attack but spoke firmly against extremism, the star tribune reports. The attackers \" do not represent any religion, they do not represent any community, they do not represent any nationality, \" one imam said. \" they are an organized group of criminals who have conspired to kill and destroy innocent lives.

        "summary": "Suspect you're not getting enough sleep? you can now verify whether that is indeed the case. In a study published last month in the journal sleep, researchers claim to have determined exactly how much sleep we need: 7.6 hours for women and 7.8 hours for men. The findings arose from a quest to look at the optimal amount of sleep needed to reduce the risk of \" sickness absence. \" to get to those findings, researchers followed 3,760 finnish participants over a seven-year span and compared their sleep disturbances ( such as early morning awakenings and use of sleeping pills ) with data on illness-related work absences provided by the country's social insurance institution. They then adjusted for a slew of things, like working conditions and education, and arrived at their figures, noting \" direct costs due to sickness absence could decrease by up to 28 % if sleep disturbances could be fully addressed. \" marketwatch cites a 2013 gallup poll that found 40 % of americans don't make it to the seven-hour mark; the average amount of sleep was 6.8 hours. That's actually slightly up from the 6.7 hours poll-takers reported to gallup in 1990 and 2001, but a big drop from how we lived decades ago: in 1942, the average was 7.9. But other recent research suggests the magic amount of sleep might actually be closer to seven hours than eight. Which figure to go with? the cdc might be able to help; it plans to issue new guidelines, possibly as soon as next year. ( in other sleep news, find out why you should nap after coffee. )",

        "summary": "A new legal problem has surfaced for dennis hastert ahead of his wednesday sentencing on financial charges related to payment of hush money over alleged sexual abuse: he never finished the payments, and the accuser has filed a lawsuit. The plaintiff, who says he was 14 when hastert molested him decades ago, wants the remaining $ 1.8 million of the $ 3.5 million he says the former house speaker promised him as compensation, the new york times reports. According to the lawsuit, which refers to the accuser as \" james doe, \" hastert agreed to compensate the man for \" trauma he suffered as a result of the admitted sexual molestation and abuse. \" in the years after the molestation, doe suffered \" severe panic attacks which led to periods of unemployment, career changes, bouts of depression, hospitalization, and long-term psychiatric treatment, \" the suit states. The agreement was made after the former student confronted hastert in 2008. After suspicious transactions attracted the attention of the fbi, hastert claimed he was being extorted by a former student, but investigators recorded a conversation between him and the accuser and decided the agreement did not constitute blackmail. According to the lawsuit, the accuser even suggested bringing in lawyers to draft a formal agreement for compensation, but hastert \" preferred to keep the negotiations strictly confidential, \" nbc news reports. Other accusations of abuse during hastert's days as a high school wrestling coach in illinois will be aired at the sentencing hearing, though the statutes of limitations for sexual misconduct charges expired long ago, npr notes. Prosecutors have recommended a prison sentence of up to six months.",

Police say harlan told them he had \" been present at a murder \" and led them to the house, where minkler's body had been dragged to a downstairs closet. Russian roulette involves \" loading a single bullet into a revolver, spinning the cylinder, and then pulling the trigger, \" a police report states. Harlan told police that after caruso brought out his revolver, he \" never allowed the other participants to handle the firearm or pull the trigger themselves. \" \" we know this wasn't russian roulette, \" minkler's mother, jamie shanklin, tells the las vegas review-journal. \" my kid was shot in the chin, like they were shutting him up. \" police say that after minkler was shot, the other teens didn't call 911 or attempt to render aid — and caruso, who recorded videos of the aftermath of the shooting, used money from the teen's wallet to buy new shoes. Both teens have been charged as adults. Caruso is charged with murder with a deadly weapon and robbery, while harlan faces charges including being an accessory to murder after the fact.",

If you missed the grammys, you didn't miss miley, but you did miss beyonce. Miley's \" wrecking ball \" wasn't nominated, and she apparently \" had no place \" in the show, reports today. No worries: beyonce took the scandalous crown from miley with her risque performance of \" drunk in love, \" which she performed in a thong bodysuit that gave hubby jay-z the chance to pat her derriere.

China started work on fast — the five-hundred-meter aperture spherical telescope — back in 2011, xinhua reports. It's scheduled to be completed this september. But first 9,110 residents living within three miles of the project need to be relocated in order to — in the words of one chinese official — \" create a sound electromagnetic wave environment. \" according to the guardian, such relocations are a \" communist party specialty, \" with millions having been moved in recent decades to make room for infrastructure projects. Relocated residents will receive a little more than $ 1,800 each for their trouble. Once complete, fast will be the largest radio telescope in the world — 200 meters greater in diameter than the current biggest in puerto rico. One scientist on the project explained its size in terms of wine, for some reason, stating that if fast were filled with wine, all 7 billion people on earth could each fill five bottles from it. The chinese government hopes to use the telescope to look for signs of extraterrestrial life and study the origins of the universe. Its size will make a difficult job slightly easier. \" a radio telescope is like a sensitive ear, listening to tell meaningful radio messages from white noise in the universe, \" the guardian quotes a fast scientist as saying. \" it is like identifying the sound of cicadas in a thunderstorm. \" time reports fast will cost $ 180 million. ( maybe we can't find aliens because they don't evolve quickly enough. )",

Giving the film a 96 % rating on rotten tomatoes, critics are singing its praises: \" effervescent, clever and thoughtful, \" coco \" is pixar's best effort since 2015's inside out and also one of its \" most gorgeously animated outings in some time, \" writes brian truitt at usa today.

Among pixar's most musical films, coco sees 13-year-old anthony gonzalez shine as main character miguel. \" the kid can sing like nobody's business, \" writes truitt. Justin chang argues the film is good, not great, missing \" the sense of filmmakers boldly and brilliantly conquering new terrain \" as in inside out. Viewers might also object to the film's \" breathless velocity, \" he writes at the los angeles times.

The \" stunning visuals \" cannot be missed. \" some of the animation in coco is so detailed that it looks photorealistic, \" she writes.

Tuesday's sell-off was sparked by uncertainty over what exactly trump and xi jinping agreed to do in their saturday meeting, and president trump championed optimism in a wednesday tweet, expressing his belief that china will push forward with a cease fire on trade. \" very strong signals being sent by china once they returned home from their long trip, including stops, from argentina. Not to sound naive or anything, but i believe president xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. All subjects discussed! \" the latest: the ap reports china's commerce ministry did say on its website that it would begin \" implementing specific issues on which consensus has been reached, \" but the vague statement included no details. Bloomberg gets a little firmer, reporting chinese officials are getting ready to start importing soybeans and liquefied natural gas from the us again, which it sees as an indication that the administration's claims that china will \" immediately \" start importing some american products again are true. And \" demand for those products is immense, \" notes the wall street journal. Still, questions remain regarding timeline, whether the retaliatory tariffs on those products will be lifted, and how much china will buy. Bloomberg also notes the ministry's statement said china will indeed take part in trade talks within the 90-day \" timetable and road map, \" marking confirmation from china that a 90-day window has been established for the negotiations. Us officials say the 90 days started saturday; china didn't specify a start date. The journal reports on another possible concession that's moving forward: china's supreme court and relevant government agencies this week announced 38 punishments for companies that commit intellectual property theft, a pain point for the us that china has thus far not done much to address.",

            "Let's start by stating the obvious: hillary rodham clinton would be a formidable presidential candidate in 2016. Mrs. Clinton's credentials as secretary of state, as a united states senator and as a politically engaged first lady would be hard for any of her democratic or republican rivals to match. She would have little trouble raising funds or garnering support from the democratic officials, and she might even come close to clearing the democratic field of serious opposition. Mrs. Clinton made some tactical errors during the 2008 campaign — particularly, in her staff's failure to understand the importance of contesting caucus states. But she improved considerably as a candidate over the course of the long primary, and the experience she gained would undoubtedly help her if she were to run again. But if mrs. Clinton runs for president in 2016, one thing is almost certain: she won't be as popular as she is right now. Recent polls show that about 65 percent of americans take a favorable view of mrs. Clinton, while only about 30 percent have a negative one. Those are remarkably high numbers for a politician in an era when many public officials are distrusted or disliked. But part of the reason for mrs. Clinton's high numbers is that, as secretary of state, she has remained largely above the partisan fray that"

            "Grown up and married, certainly, but mature? not by a long shot 'american reunion, ' with jason biggs and eugene levy believe it or not, there are teenagers in this great country who respond to intrinsically hilarious phrases like \"band camp, \" \"stifler's mom \" and \"eugene levy \" with blank, uncomprehending stares. The arrival of \"american reunion \" is no doubt partly intended to remedy this alarming cultural deficit and also to remind former teenagers of jokes that used to make them laugh. Beyond that, this latest installment in the \"american pie \" franchise — the fourth to be released in theaters and the first since \"american wedding, \" way back in 2003 — asserts a claim of paternity, or at least big-brotherhood. You know all those raunchy, regressive comedies about a bunch of dudes driven to excessive partying by their hysterical fear of women and their panicky half-awareness of their own homoerotic impulses?

After 42-year-old le bich-thuy was raped and strangled after leaving rockville's twinbrook metro station in 1994, dna recovered from the scene was found to match dna in the 1989 rape of a 52-year-old woman who'd departed the same station, reports the washington post. But \" i don't think he did this just two or three times. This guy was targeting women in that area for at least five years, \" says sgt. Chris homrock, pointing to one case in which a woman escaped an attempted rapist days before bich-thuy's murder. To finally catch the attacker, police turned to parabon nanolabs, a virginia-based company specializing in dna phenotyping, reports bethesda magazine. Two computer-generated images were created using predictions of the suspect's ancestry, eye color, hair color, skin color, freckling, and face shape. Released monday, they show how the suspect — white, with blue eyes and no freckles — might have appeared at ages 25 and 45. In a statement, per wtop, montgomery county police stress the composites \" are scientific approximations of appearance based on dna and are not likely to be exact replicas of appearance. \" still, anyone who recognizes the man is asked to call the major crimes division. \" we're looking for any new information, anything these images might prompt someone to remember, \" says homrock, noting \" the common theme of these cases is they all start at the twinbrook metro. \" a reward of up to $ 10,000 is offered for information leading to an arrest, reports fox 5.

Perhaps a few weeks or month, back the name sambisa forest meant nothing to many nigerians. Not anymore. It has come to signify terror and home to the terrorist group boko haram. The forest is now a myth for so many people within the lake chad basin who have come to align the complex north eastern vegetation to the home of boko haram instead of the game reserve the colonialist meant it for. The colonial government had marked the forest out as a game reserve! today, sambisa has become one of the strongest bases of the boko haram insurgents who run back into its dark recesses anytime they have finished their slaughter of harmless citizens. Others in this part of the country rightly associate it with wicked and poisonous reptiles such as loud hissing rattle snakes and giant crustaceans crawling underneath the forest vegetation which is not more than sometimes 1.5metres in some areas while some areas could be as high as two metres depending on the size of the shrubs growing in that section.

            "Chicago ( cbs ) — thirteen people were killed and at least 52 others, including a pregnant woman, were wounded in shootings across chicago over labor day weekend, according to chicago police. The latest homicide happened about 10: 45 p.m. Monday in the east garfield park neighborhood on the west side. A group was standing on the sidewalk in the 2700 block of west lexington when someone in a silver minivan opened fire, police said. A 22-year-old man was shot in the chest and taken to stroger hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Another 22-year-old man suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and thigh and was taken to mount sinai hospital, where he was also pronounced dead. Three other people were also shot and taken to mount sinai, police said. A 16-year-old boy was shot in the chest and listed in critical condition; a 17-year-old boy suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and was seriously wounded; and a 20-year-old man was shot in the right arm and buttocks and was also listed in serious condition. Earlier monday evening, two men were killed in a shooting near ogden park in the englewood neighborhood on the south side. About 7: 15 p.m., a 47-year-old man was walking his dog in the 1200 block of west marquette when someone in a vehicle started shooting, striking him in the chest,"

As part of a project to calculate the amount of carbon — essential for the formation of planets and life — that exists between the stars, the astronomers recreated the interstellar dust generated by carbon stars and discovered that the milky way alone holds around 10 billion trillion trillion tons of \" space grease. \" solar wind keeps much of it out of our solar system, but any spacecraft travelling between the stars is likely to arrive with a sticky, dirty coating of carbon. \" this space grease is not the kind of thing you'd want to spread on a slice of toast, \" says study co-author tim schmidt of the university of new south wales. \" it's dirty, likely toxic and only forms in the environment of interstellar space — and our laboratory. \" schmidt tells cnn that the substance is like greasy soot. \" it's not a pure substance, it's not biological, \" he says. \" it would make things dirty like soot would. \" about half the carbon in space is thought to be elemental carbon.

            "There is considerable uncertainty as to the amount of carbon incorporated in interstellar dust. The aliphatic component of the carbonaceous dust is of particular interest because it produces a significant 3.4 μm absorption feature when viewed against a background radiation source. The optical depth of the 3.4 μm absorption feature is related to the number of aliphatic carbon c-h bonds along the line of sight. It is possible to estimate the column density of carbon locked up in the aliphatic hydrocarbon component of interstellar dust from quantitative analysis of the 3.4 μm interstellar absorption feature providing that the absorption coefficient of aliphatic hydrocarbons incorporated in the interstellar dust is known. We report laboratory analogues of interstellar dust by experimentally mimicking interstellar/circumstellar conditions. The resultant spectra of these dust analogues closely match those from astronomical observations. Measurements of the absorption coefficient of aliphatic hydrocarbons incorporated in the analogues were carried out by a procedure combining ftir and 13c nmr spectroscopies.",

Jones, who previously claimed the shooting was a hoax, says he admitted it happened but that kelly purposely omitted the comment. In the recording, kelly promises she won't take jones ' comments out of context. She even says he can review all interview clips to see \" whether we are taking it in context, what you are saying. \" given the backlash to the interview, page six reports kelly has asked families of sandy hook victims to appear; one father has agreed to appear.",

        "summary": "People prone to angry outbursts are more than twice as likely to be infected with a common parasite called toxoplasma gondii, which is often spread through cat feces. So report researchers in the journal of clinical psychiatry, who looked for circulating antibodies to the parasite in 358 adults with intermittent explosive disorder ( ied ), non-ied psychiatric disorders ( psychiatric controls ), or no evidence of any psychiatric diagnosis ( healthy controls ). They found the parasite in just 9 % of those without ied but 22 % of those with it. Toxoplasmosis has been linked to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, impulsiveness, and suicidal behavior, reports the telegraph, but even so this finding surprised researchers. \" we don't yet understand the mechanisms involved, \" coauthor dr. Royce lee of the university of chicago tells live science. \" it could be an increased inflammatory response, direct brain modulation by the parasite, or even reverse causation where aggressive individuals tend to have more cats or eat more undercooked meat. \" indeed, the study establishes an association but not causation, and while the parasite can cause severe neurological problems and death in infants infected through pregnant mothers, it tends to cause far fewer problems in most of the 20 % of americans who've been infected by it. Researchers may next look for the parasite in the brains ( instead of just bodies ) of those with ied, or try treating ied patients for the infection to see if symptoms disappear.

In the study of more than 350 adults, those with a psychiatric disorder called intermittent explosive disorder, or ied, were twice as likely to have been infected by the toxoplasmosis parasite compared with healthy individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. The study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that toxoplasmosis — usually a mild or nonsymptomatic infection from a protozoan parasite called toxoplasma gondii — may somehow alter people's brain chemistry to cause long-term behavior problems. Previous studies have linked toxoplasmosis to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, impulsivity and suicidal behavior. The researchers stressed, however, that they merely have identified an association between toxoplasmosis and rage, and cannot say that toxoplasmosis causes rage — or that people should get rid of their cats, for that matter. \" not everyone that tests positive for toxoplasmosis will have aggression issues, \" said dr. Emil coccaro, a professor and chairman of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the university of chicago, who led the study.

Federally-subsidized school meals must contain a certain amount of vegetables, and now pizza, with its two tablespoons of tomato sauce, can continue to be one of those vegetables.

The latter announced the wrong miss universe in 2015, and at sunday night's oscars, the former made the same mistake during the presentation of the biggest award of the night, per the los angeles times and entertainment weekly. Beatty goofed around and stalled for dramatic effect before handing the best picture envelope to dunaway to read the winner, which she announced as la la land. The team behind that movie headed up to the stage to celebrate the night's big win, and the acceptance speeches began — when suddenly an unexpected followup announcement was made. \" [ actually ] moonlight is the winner...

Beatty had apparently been given the wrong envelope ( the one for best actress, emma stone, for la la land ), and when dunaway was given the envelope, she simply read the movie's name aloud. The players for both movies switched spots, with moonlight's shocked performers and crew taking the stage. \" i love la la land, \" moonlight director barry jenkins said, while kimmel tried to salvage the moment with: \" i blame steve harvey. \"",

Obama will appear with the comedian jimmy kimmel before a star-studded crowd at the white house correspondents ' association dinner, mr. Romney and his allies once again tried to turn mr. Obama's own celebrity against him.

Buzzfeed reports that both cases are ongoing, and notes that the alerts are being rolled out while congress considers two bills that could protect consumers from being sued for online reviews.

These range from classic dodges to'tried and true ways to help yourself get out of a hole. ' keep score. Presidential debates can be interesting and informative. But the language of the debates, and the media/political world's reaction to them, leans on a surprisingly small handful of stock expressions and phrases. With the long-awaited first republican debate on thursday, we thought we'd explain what we ' ll almost certainly hear during and after this debate, as well as in future debates. One maxim for politicians – especially in debates – is that you don't always answer the question that you were asked; you respond to the one that you want asked. So get ready to hear \"the question we should be asking …, \" in the manner of democrat john edwards in 2007, when he was queried about whether he considered russia a friend or a foe. After a perfunctory nonanswer, he honed in on what he wanted to talk about: \"i think the question we should be asking ourselves is, how does american change the underlying dynamic of what's happening in the world? … i think for that to occur, the world has to see america as a force for good again, which is why i talked about leading an effort to make primary-school education available to 100 million children in the world who don't have it. \" this pivot happens so often in debates that there's a name for it: the \"clubhouse turn. \" northeastern university journalism professor alan schroeder, author of several books on presidential debates, traces the phrase's origin to michael sheehan, a debate coach for bill clinton and other democrats. \" 'clubhouse turn'strikes me as a particularly appropriate metaphor to apply to debates, since this is a genre with other parallels to horse racing, \" schroeder said. Another debate maxim is to trivialize unwanted topics by seeking to regain the rhetorical high ground. Hence the popularity of the term \"distraction from the real issues. \" lobbyist jim manley, a former spokesman for democratic sens. Ted kennedy and harry reid, calls it \"a tried-and-true way to help yourselves get out of the hole and on the offensive. \" debaters may despise their opponents, but the trick is to avoid seeming petty.

Linsey malia, 21, of easton, mass., and leah bell of covington, la., were killed saturday when a jet ski crashed into a boat carrying them in copenhagen harbor, reports mass live. Six others, including at least five boaters, were treated for injuries at a hospital and released, reports the copenhagen post, which adds it's illegal to ride jet skis in the harbor. Several people were seen trying to flee the scene on jet skis after the crash, but police say nine people are now in custody, including a 24-year-old man arrested on suspicion of aggravated manslaughter, per the ap. The students were celebrating the end of the spring semester and were to return home over the next week. A relative describes malia, an honors student at stonehill college, as a \" shining star \" who \" made everyone who knew her smile, \" per the boston globe. A professor adds she'd co-authored a research paper that she was to present at an august meeting of the society for the study of social problems. Christ episcopal church identified bell, a student at california's pomona college, as a crash victim on facebook. The post noted her parents have traveled to denmark, where a lawmaker is calling for a total ban on jet skis off the coast. Bell was studying to be a neonatal nurse, and her psychology professor describes how bell \" loved the experience of holding babies, premature babies, of helping families learn to bond with them... It's such a beautiful aspiration that it just makes it more painful to lose her. \" ( an american died while studying in rome over the summer. )",

Tiffany li, a 31-year-old woman accused of killing her ex-boyfriend and the father of her two children last year, is expected to post one of the largest bails in us history thursday, using $ 62 million in property and $ 4 million in cash, reports cbs san francisco. In california, the value of property used as collateral must be twice the bail amount. Li, who has been in jail for about a year, comes from a wealthy family, says a san mateo county district attorney. Her lawyer adds that the property was \" put up by 15 to 20 extended family, friends, business associates, \" and others who believe li is innocent. Prosecutors, however, say a custody battle over the couple's young daughters led li to conspire with her boyfriend and friend to kill keith green last year. Authorities say green was reported missing on april 29, 2016, a day after he met with li to discuss the custody dispute in millbrae, calif., per the san jose mercury news. He was found dead of a gunshot wound two weeks later about 80 miles from millbrae. Given prosecutors ' fears that li could \" flee back to her native china, \" per the ap, she would be kept under house arrest and subject to electronic monitoring if the bail amount is approved by a judge. A jury trial in the case is set for september. ( a judge set this man's bail at $ 4 billion to make a point. )",

        "summary": "President obama's plan to ease the student debt problem is \" simple, powerful, and long overdue, \" writes jordan weissmann at the atlantic. It's also probably doomed. As he spelled out yesterday, obama wants to help students figure out which schools give them the best value, factoring in things like tuition and employment after graduation. Schools with higher rankings would see more federal aid, which would theoretically spur reform and thus lower costs. \" on a broad philosophical level, the proposal would fundamentally rewire the relationship between the federal government and the world of higher education, by introducing at least somewhat meaningful accountability measures for the first time across all sectors of the industry, from the ivy league, to the university of phoenix, \" writes weissmann. The catch? the department of education can come up with any ranking it wants, but tying the results to federal aid needs the approval of congress, and republicans already seem skeptical. Marco rubio, for instance, called such a plan a \" slippery slope \" that would give \" washington bureaucrats \" too much sway over the private sector. The plan is an \" important first step, \" writes weissmann, \" but it's not clear when, or if, it will lead anywhere. \" at business insider, josh barro is more enthusiastic. \" in the case of higher education, the constituency getting its ox gored by cost control will be college professors and administrators, hardly a fixture of republican fundraisers or tea party town halls, \" he writes. \" that bodes well for bipartisan compromise on this issue. \" click for barro's full column, or weissmann's full column.",

Both captured in tunisia in may 1943, they gained momentary notoriety when, moved to act in part by news that schymalla's 60-year-old father had been conscripted to join the withering nazi forces, they managed to escape by boat. Having dug their way under a wire fence just before midnight on a saturday in late october, they set off from algona-branch camp no. 4 near bena, minn. Their plan: follow lake winnibigoshish to the mississippi river to new orleans, where they hoped to catch a ride home, reports the minneapolis star tribune. They had a head start in their journey thanks to the lack of a sunday-morning count; the search began more than 24 hours after their escape. In a 1994 article for minnesota history magazine, historian george lobdell wrote that having been in the state since february, the men knew they needn't fear \" wild animals or indians. \" unfortunately, the three small maps they found in a dictionary \" apparently gave no understanding of the distances involved \" ( as evidenced by the great number of things they packed, including shoe polish and a cigarette-rolling machine ). They made it 20-odd miles south in the first few days, then hit a snowstorm and ultimately took a wrong turn into jay gould lake on friday. There they were spotted by a resort owner who called the county sheriff, and they were ultimately caught hiding in bushes. Their punishment: 30 days in confinement.

A sense of duty compelled him to hatch a getaway plan to get back to the front. When he whispered his intentions to mai, they agreed to make a joint run for it. Mai and schymalla found some unmarked extra clothing in a supply room to replace their prison garb. They each sneaked bacon, bread and sausages from their daily meal allotments and accepted similar gifts from fellow prisoners. Armed with a small map, they realized that lake winnibigoshish connected with the mississippi river.

One letter — detailing how his 60-year-old father and brother had been conscripted to join the beleaguered nazi military — sparked schymalla to make his dramatic jail break. A sense of duty compelled him to hatch a getaway plan to get back to the front. When he whispered his intentions to mai, they agreed to make a joint run for it. Mai and schymalla found some unmarked extra clothing in a supply room to replace their prison garb. They each sneaked bacon, bread and sausages from their daily meal allotments and accepted similar gifts from fellow prisoners. Armed with a small map, they realized that lake winnibigoshish connected with the mississippi river. If they could make it to new orleans, they hoped, maybe a neutral ship would ferry them home. \"the assumptions that led the men to such hopes were absurd, but their small maps apparently gave no understanding of the distances involved, \" historian george lobdell wrote in a 1994 minnesota history"

The driver suffered only minor injuries because a depression in the roof of the car created a space that enveloped her when the car flipped over and landed. It took dozens of safety personnel from multiple agencies about five hours to extricate the girl late wednesday in a remote high desert area west of strawberry. The teen was listed in good condition thursday at a flagstaff hospital while the other two girls, ages 16 and 17, were released, according to yavapai county sheriff's officials. No names were immediately released. Two of the teens had managed to climb up to the road when an ambulance crew responded to a 911 call from a passer-by, said capt. Paul voakes of the pine-strawberry fire district. Rescuers used ropes to go down the cliff or hiked in via a creek bed to reach the upside-down car. The girl was face-down and responders could see only one hand and a foot until using inflation bags and other gear to lift the car, voakes said. \" when we first got there, she was pretty excited as i think anybody would be, \" voakes said. \" we calmed her down. \" voakes",

            "Three teenage girls were rescued after their car careened over a 100-foot cliff in northern arizona and landed on top of the 16-year-old driver after she was thrown from the vehicle, officials said thursday. The driver suffered only minor injuries because a depression in the roof of the car created a space that enveloped her when the car flipped over and landed. It took dozens of safety personnel from multiple agencies about five hours to extricate the girl late wednesday in a remote high desert area west of strawberry. The teen was listed in good condition thursday at a flagstaff hospital while the other two girls, ages 16 and 17, were released, according to yavapai county sheriff's officials. No names were immediately released. Two of the teens had managed to climb up to the road when an ambulance crew responded to a 911 call from a passer-by, said capt. Paul voakes of the pine-strawberry fire district. Rescuers used ropes to go down the cliff or hiked in via a creek bed to reach the upside-down car. The girl was face-down and responders could see only one hand and a foot until using inflation bags and other gear to lift the car, voakes said. \" when we first got there, she was pretty excited as i think anybody would be, \" voakes said. \" we calmed her down. \" voakes",

According to the airline, a chinese couple who were traveling with a tour group became furious when they were seated apart, and instead of calming down when flight attendants were able to seat them together, the woman ordered instant noodles and boiling water and then proceeded to chuck the scalding water on a flight attendant after a dispute over payment, jalopnik reports. Witnesses say the pilot made the decision to return to bangkok after the man threatened to blow up the plane and the woman started pounding on the plane windows and saying she was going to kill herself, the wall street journal reports. Xinhua — which describes the incident as \" the latest scandal to taint the image of chinese tourists abroad \" — reports that the couple and two other passengers involved were arrested after the plane landed in bangkok and had to pay $ 1,500 compensation to the attendant. After the incident last thursday was reported in state media in china over the weekend, authorities issued a statement saying the passengers had been put on a travel blacklist because they \" severely tarnished the image of the chinese people. \"",

Actually, the chance of that last one is remote, but technically possible, and now more than ever. China acknowledged last year that its tiangong-1 lab, launched in 2011, was likely to plunge toward earth this year or next. As the orlando sentinel explains, it's time to start keeping an eye skyward because the 9-ton craft has dropped below 185 miles in altitude, and things will only start accelerating from here. ( you can actually track the craft here; the altitude level fluctuates. ) china has narrowed the time frame of the final descent to somewhere between now and april 2018, and while most of the lab is expected to burn up in the atmosphere, astrophysicist jonathan mcdowell tells the guardian that chunks weighing about 200 pounds could make it through. China says it will alert the un when the craft begins its descent, but the astrophysicist says six or seven hours is the most notice we can expect. Still, it's all but impossible to figure out where any debris might land, given that a tiny change in atmospheric conditions could move it \" from one continent to the next, \" mcdowell says. The odds are in your favor, however. No injuries have ever been reported as a result of falling spacecraft, despite the crashing of the soviet union's salyut 7 space station in 1991 and the fall of nasa's 85-ton skylab in 1979. China might be concerned, however, with what the failure of tiangong-1, or \" heavenly palace, \" means for its progress in the \" new space race, \" per wired.

Randall hackett, 58, and his 28-year-old son-in-law, alexander auerbach, had decided to swim part of the 4-mile distance of crane beach in ipswich around 5pm tuesday, report the salem news and wcvb. Both are strong swimmers, and they were clad in wetsuits, but family members were nonetheless concerned when neither had returned to shore after an hour and a half, per abc news. Shortly after family members reported the pair missing, auerbach was found on the beach around 7: 30pm, about a mile south of the men's starting point, but he said he'd lost track of hackett because of rip currents and heavy fog. For two hours, the coast guard, police, and fire department combed the water before rescuers using an infrared camera aboard a helicopter spotted hackett treading water a quarter-mile offshore, per wcvb. Hackett was plucked from the water around 9: 30pm and returned to the beach, where he walked into his wife's arms. \" the fog was so thick you couldn't even see your hand, \" says hackett, who was taken to a hospital as a precaution. \" i made the decision to try and conserve energy, \" he adds, noting he clung to a buoy for a time. \" i thought i could survive until morning. \" on facebook, police called the rescue \" a tremendous effort … in difficult conditions and rough waters, \" while the coast guard warns water conditions are getting worse as temperatures drop.

        "summary": "Potential good news for kids — and the parents who hate to watch them squirm when faced with a needle. Researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology have developed a technology that could allow childhood vaccines — for everything from polio to measles, mumps, and rubella — to be combined into a single injection, reports the bbc. The idea is that one shot would inject microscopic capsules of vaccine into a person, and those capsules would be designed to break down and release their contents at different times, per the science study. A simpler application would be to deliver one vaccine and its necessary booster shots at one time. In tests on mice, researchers were able to time the release of the booster doses to exactly nine, 20, and 41 days after the initial shot. The concept has not been tested in humans yet. \" for the first time, we can create a library of tiny, encased vaccine particles, each programmed to release at a precise, predictable time, so that people could potentially receive a single injection that, in effect, would have multiple boosters already built into it, \" mit's robert langer says in a release. In the developing world especially, this \" might be the difference between not getting vaccinated and receiving all of your vaccines in one shot, \" adds study author kevin mchugh, whose research was funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation. Much work remains: for one thing, scientists would need to figure out how to keep the doses, normally refrigerated, stable in a warm body, per the guardian. They also are trying to further shrink the capsules so they can be injected directly into muscle, per new scientist. ( a vaccine for the common cold is in the works. )",

The commentary, with the byline \" kim chol, \" said the weapons program is as precious to north korea \" as its own life \" and the \" line of access to nukes for the existence and development of the country can neither be changed nor shaken, \" no matter what china does. It adds that the program will continue even if it means the end of north korea-china relations, though it warns china that such a scenario would bring \" grave consequences. \" other commentaries critical of china have appeared in north korea's state news media recently, but none were so pointed or identified china by name. It isn't clear if north korea would actually give up its ally, which supplies almost all of its external trade and oil imports, but one expert suggests the country could make do with stronger ties to russia and south korea.

        "summary": "Google is shutting down its long-shunned plus social network for consumers, following its disclosure of a flaw discovered in march that could have exposed some personal information of up to 500,000 people, the ap reports. The announcement came in a monday blog post, which marked google's first public description of the privacy bug. Google deliberately avoided disclosing the problem at the time, in part to avoid drawing regulatory scrutiny and damaging its reputation, according to a wall street journal story that cited anonymous individuals and documents. The mountain view, calif., company declined to comment on the journal's report, and didn't fully explain in its blog post why it held off on revealing the bug until monday. As for google+, it will be shut down over the next 10 months, but will remain open for enterprise customers who use it within their companies. When google launched plus in 2011, it was supposed to be a challenger to facebook's social network, which now has more than 2 billion users. But plus flopped and quickly turned into a digital ghost town, prompting google to start de-emphasizing it several years ago. But the company kept it open long enough to cause an embarrassing privacy gaffe that could give congress an excuse to enact tighter controls on data collection. The google plus flaw could have allowed up to 438 external apps to scoop up user names, email addresses, occupations, genders, and ages without authorization. The company didn't find evidence that any of the personal information affected by the plus breach was misused. The timeline laid out by google indicates the company discovered the privacy lapse around the same time facebook was under fire for a leak in its far more popular social network. Facebook's breakdown exposed the personal information of as many as 87 million users to cambridge analytica, a data mining firm affiliated with president trump's 2016 campaign.",

That was apparently the unspoken code at a wedding last sunday in palm coast, fla., where the new york post reports an uninvited interloper caused a scene with a man she claimed was her boyfriend. Per wkmg, deputies say 20-year-old shelby mcdowell snuck into the hammock beach resort to keep tabs on darby johns, who was attending a wedding there as an invited guest and who mcdowell says is her romantic partner. Once there, mcdowell said she saw johns making out with a woman on the dance floor. That woman told cops mcdowell rushed over to where she and johns were, tossed a drink on the pair, then punched her face; johns says they hadn't even made it to the dance floor yet when mcdowell came onto the scene, and he denies kissing the other woman. After allegedly assaulting johns ' companion, witnesses say mcdowell then ran to a resort bathroom — and that's when the wedding party apparently decided to get involved. Mcdowell says a bunch of bridesmaids yanked her out of a bathroom stall by her feet and started hitting her, but the resort manager told police that when he arrived on the scene to break up the brawl, mcdowell was on top of the woman who'd been with johns and was punching her. To make matters more complicated, at least for mcdowell: johns says she's not his girlfriend. Mcdowell was booked at the flagler county jail and faces misdemeanor battery charges, per wpec.

At least 15 cases of sexual assault, including four rapes and one attempted rape, and 15 arrests have been reported since the festival started july 6, drawing attention once more to the sexual violence that's been prominent on organizers ' radar since the 2008 beating death of a young woman, the guardian reports. Five of the suspects are being tied to one alleged attack: the rape of a 19-year-old woman that was reportedly filmed on a cellphone, the new york times reports. One of the men is said to be a recent grad of spain's military police corps, while another is also reportedly a service member. A female police officer says she was molested; a 22-year-old french woman said she was raped in a parking lot bathroom, per the local. Thousands have already taken to the streets in protest, demonstrating against what san fermin mayor joseba asiron last year called an \" intolerable … black stain on san fermin. \" the telegraph notes that last year's event saw only four sexual assault reports total, making this year's increase alarming. But the councilor of pamplona's public safety program says that rise in numbers is only because the city is working so hard to combat sexual violence, making it easier for women to report it and therefore upping the number of attacks cited in the media. \" i don't think what's happening in pamplona is different from what's happening in other cities at festival time, \" he tells the guardian. \" it's just that we've opened up the channels of communication \" and have 3,400 officers on the streets.",

Per marketwatch, gering added that a jury could also conclude that abc wanted to put a \" negative spin \" on the segment even before it started digging into the story. Beef products says hundreds of jobs disappeared when it was forced to shutter three of its four plants after the \" pink slime \" reports, which a company lawyer called \" fake news \" in front of gering in january. Because of south dakota's strict \" veggie hate crime \" laws, which offer triple damages when the safety of a food product is falsely disparaged, abc could be slammed with nearly $ 6 billion in damages. The judge noted that she cleared sawyer because, as the news anchor, she would've ostensibly not had as much to do with research as others working on the segment.",

It contains no material likely to offend or harm \" and \" should be suitable for audiences aged 4 years and over. \" the cost of that classification: more than $ 6,000. But hey, it was money \" well spent, \" says lyne, who created the 10-hour movie — which indeed shows nothing but paint drying on a brick wall — with the sole intention of sticking it to the man, per sky news. Basically any film aiming for a uk release has to be reviewed by the bbfc, which charges $ 145 per review, plus an additional $ 10 and change for each minute the film runs, per the international business times. Because lyne knew examiners would have to watch an entire flick to review it, he started a kickstarter campaign with the goal of creating the longest and most boring movie possible. \" about a year ago, i went to a filmmaker open day held by the bbfc, \" lyne writes in a reddit ama. \" i'd expected to see quite a lot of conflict between the bbfc examiners and the visiting filmmakers whose work was at the mercy of the board, but … most of the filmmakers — even those who'd had trouble with the bbfc in the past — seemed totally resigned to the censorship imposed by the board, even supportive of it, \" he says. \" i think that shocked me into action. \" in the end, lyne raised about $ 8,500 and submitted a 607-minute film for review. Two examiners had to watch the film over two days. But \" examiners are required to watch a very wide variety of content every day, so this didn't phase them, \" a bbfc rep tells mashable.

A tip led authorities yesterday to a \" very remote, narrow road down in a ravine \" on private property, where the 200-square-foot \" hempel hideaway \" was found, owner chris hempel tells the spokesman-review. Someone \" had it tucked back up in the woods on stilts \" and constructed a deck around it, apparently making use of materials from now-dismantled bunk beds inside, adds hempel, who visited the site. \" it's going to be very difficult getting it out of there. \" she says there's some structural damage and much of the family's camping gear and equipment are gone and have been replaced with personal belongings. A stevens county sheriff says police have a suspect but haven't made any arrests. \" we believe the person who stole this cabin, or people who stole the cabin, were planning on living in it, \" the sheriff says, per kxly. Hempel says the suspect is male, but \" i don't think he could have done that job by himself just looking at where it was and how it was set up. \" the cabin was stolen from the hempels ' 20-acre property near nine mile falls sometime after march 21. Krem reports a neighbor saw a trailer carrying the cabin away in broad daylight. \" i was sitting here at my desk and saw the shed go by thinking that somebody got their shed repossessed and found out later that it was stolen, \" she says. \" i didn't think anything of it \" until news of the theft spread.
