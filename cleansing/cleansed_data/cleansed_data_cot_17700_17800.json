Christine archibald, 30, had been living in the netherlands, where fiance tyler ferguson was working. She was hit as the attackers drove into pedestrians on london bridge. Ferguson \" is broken into a million pieces, \" his sister tells the cbc. \" he held her and watched her die in his arms. \" before moving to europe last year, archibald worked in a calgary homeless shelter. Her family says she had \" room in her heart for everyone \" and people can honor her by making their communities better places. \" volunteer your time and labor or donate to a homeless shelter. Tell them chrissy sent you, \" they said in a statement.

President trump has been strongly criticized for what opponents are calling a petty and politicized response to the attack, the washington post reports. In a series of tweets, the president defended his travel ban, criticized london's mayor for telling people to remain calm, attacked \" political correctness, \" and brought up gun control. \" do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? that's because they used knives and a truck!, \" he said. There are four police officers among the 48 injured, including a transport police officer who was praised for his courage after tackling the attackers during their stabbing spree, armed with only a baton, cnn reports. The officer is in stable condition in the hospital with injuries to his head, face, and leg. Experts say the \" ride, hide, tell \" response advocated by british police probably saved lives during the attack, the ap reports. The response, which has been promoted across europe, advises people caught up in a terror attack to run to a place of safety, hide and barricade themselves if fleeing is not an option, and call police when it's safe to do so.

        "summary": "With jpmorgan chase facing scrutiny over its hiring in china, the new york times is raising questions about a worker who is a family friend of a chinese insurance regulator. In june 2012, when jpmorgan was looking for work with chinese insurance firms, ceo jamie dimon met with the regulator, xiang junbo, according to an email and interviews by the times. The translator at the meeting was xiang's family friend, and xiang had been trying for a month to get her a job at jpmorgan. During the meeting, xiang asked dimon to hire her as a \" favor, \" the email said. Dimon reportedly said his company would \" do what we can. \" the applicant ended up with a specially created internship and then a full-time job, insiders tell the times. Following the meeting, jpmorgan was involved in several deals with companies overseen by xiang. A bank spokesman says dimon \" played no role in the hiring decision. \" separately, dimon last year received a 74 % pay raise — in a year when his company forked over $ 20 billion amid federal charges, the washington post recently reported. His $ 20 million pay is now earning criticism from sen. Elizabeth warren. \" jamie dimon got a raise after he negotiated $ 17 billion to pay for activities that were illegal that he presided over. So i ' m not quite sure how this is a deterrent for other ceos, \" she said, per cnbc.",

            "Jamie dimon can do no wrong — at least in the eyes of his board. Even though jpmorgan chase handed the government more than $ 20 billion to settle an array of charges in 2013, the board of directors still raised the chief executive's pay by 74 percent, according to a regulatory filing released friday. The board voted to award dimon $ 18.5 million in restricted stock that will vest over the next three years. Coupled with his base salary of $ 1.5 million, which remained unchanged from the previous year, dimon's total compensation last year was $ 20 million. That's up from $ 11.5 million in 2012, a year in which the board halved dimon's compensation as a reprimand for the $ 6.2 billion trading fiasco known as the \"london whale. \" fallout from the trading losses culminated in $ 1.9 billion in fines paid by the bank to u.s. And british authorities last year. It sparked a shareholder vote in may on whether dimon should remain chairman and chief executive: only 32 percent of investors voted to strip dimon of the dual title. Now the board has cemented that vote of confidence that dimon is every bit the leader he was when he steered the bank through the financial crisis. But a lot has changed since then. In october, the bank suffered its first loss in nearly a decade, reporting a net loss of $ 380 million after setting aside an additional $ 9.2 billion for future litigation expenses. Some of that money was earmarked to settle regulatory investigations into the bank's mortgage securities business. Those probes came to a head in november, when jpmorgan agreed to pay the government $ 13 billion to resolve allegations that the bank knowingly sold faulty mortgage securities that contributed to the financial crisis. The settlement earned jpmorgan the dubious distinction of paying the largest penalty ever dealt to a single company",
            "Following a year plagued by regulatory headaches, jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon's wallet got even fatter — a move that sen. Elizabeth warren, d-mass., questioned thursday. For 2013, dimon was awarded a 74-percent pay raise to $ 20 million by the bank's board even as it grappled with billions in penalties and settlements. \" jamie dimon got a raise after he negotiated $ 17 billion to pay for activities that were illegal that he presided over. So i ' m not quite sure how this is a deterrent for other ceos, \" warren said during a senate banking committee hearing.

That's up from $ 11.5 million in 2012, a year in which the board halved dimon's compensation as a reprimand for the $ 6.2 billion trading fiasco known as the \"london whale. \" fallout from the trading losses culminated in $ 1.9 billion in fines paid by the bank to u.s. And british authorities last year. It sparked a shareholder vote in may on whether dimon should remain chairman and chief executive: only 32 percent of investors voted to strip dimon of the dual title. Now the board has cemented that vote of confidence that dimon is every bit the leader he was when he steered the bank through the financial crisis. But a lot has changed since then. In october, the bank suffered its first loss in nearly a decade, reporting a net loss of $ 380 million after setting aside an additional $ 9.2 billion for future litigation expenses. Some of that money was earmarked to settle regulatory investigations into the bank's mortgage securities business. Those probes came to a head in november, when jpmorgan agreed to pay the government $ 13 billion to resolve allegations that the bank knowingly sold faulty mortgage securities that contributed to the financial crisis. The settlement earned jpmorgan the dubious distinction of paying the largest penalty ever dealt to a single company",
            "Following a year plagued by regulatory headaches, jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon's wallet got even fatter — a move that sen. Elizabeth warren, d-mass., questioned thursday. For 2013, dimon was awarded a 74-percent pay raise to $ 20 million by the bank's board even as it grappled with billions in penalties and settlements. \" jamie dimon got a raise after he negotiated $ 17 billion to pay for activities that were illegal that he presided over. So i ' m not quite sure how this is a deterrent for other ceos, \" warren said during a senate banking committee hearing. During the year, jpmorgan's stock surged nearly 31 percent, slightly outpacing the rise in the s&p 500. — written by cnbc's katie little. Reported by cnbc's eamon javers"

        "summary": "Tonya thomas shot her four children 18 times in tuesday's massacre, and two of them were shot as the gun pressed against their chests, according to the medical examiner's report. She used jacketed, hollow-point bullets, which cause more damage than full-metal jacket rounds, and used a single taurus.38-caliber revolver, which she would have had to reload three times. About 36 minutes passed from when the first shots were reported to 911 until the last shot was heard, florida today reports. ( thomas reportedly smoked a cigarette after killing her children and before killing herself. ) previous reports from the ap and fox news paint a tragic picture of the family's history: joe johnson, father to the murdered children joel, jazlin, jaxs, and pebbles, was arrested after allegedly punching and kicking thomas in 2000. Thomas and the children eventually began living with johnson again, leading the department of children and families to remove the children from the home but return them a month later. The couple worked with a caseworker and investigators said the children appeared \" bonded \" to the parents and healthy, but thomas was arrested in 2002 for allegedly striking johnson. The charge was later dropped. In the months before the shooting, it was not clear how much contact johnson had with the family. In april, authorities were called to the home on three successive days: the first day, thomas said her son threw a bicycle through a window; the next day, she said her son kicked her and punched her as she tried to wake him up for school; the third day, investigators responded to allegations of inadequate supervision. Also in april, son jaxs was arrested for battery against his mother. After she did not pick him up from juvenile detention, child welfare investigators looked into the home situation and saw no signs that the children were in danger. The investigator last spoke to thomas on may 10 and the case was closed may 13, just two days before the massacre. The daughter of a neighbor says the boys had been causing problems on the street, shooting bb guns at another house and threatening to set it on fire. A wrenching account of one of the 911 calls reveals that neighbors weren't sure who was doing the shooting — thomas or one of her kids — and a crying female caller said at one point, \" i knew this was gonna happen. \" she also refused to let the children enter her home, unsure who had the gun. \" get back, you're not coming in our house, \" she can be heard saying.",

Rather, new fathers in the us are now older than ever. Cnn reports the average age of a dad in 1972 was 27.4; the average age in 2015 was 30.9. Meanwhile, the percentage of babies born to dads over 40 went from 4.1 % to 8.9 %, and — as per cbs news — the percentage of births involving fathers over 50 went from 0.5 % to 0.9 %. The oldest father in the study, which looked at records from 169 million births in the us, was a whooping 88 years old. ( the youngest was 11. ) dr. Michael eisenberg says \" it's important for us to pay attention to \" the results of the study and \" what their implications could be for society. \" live science reports children of older fathers are at higher risk of autism, schizophrenia, pediatric cancers, and more due to mutations in sperm that increase with age. Older fathers are also likely to have fewer children, potentially depleting the future workforce. \" i ' m not trying to sound alarmist, but these are issues to think about, \" eisenberg says. But it's not all bad news: older dads are also more likely to live with their children, have a good job, and be involved in their children's lives. Meanwhile, the average age of new mothers is actually increasing slightly faster than that of new dads. ( another study found older dads have geekier sons. )",

Years later, his lawyer, sergei magnitsky, died in prison after accusing russian officials of corruption. With browder's help, several countries would go on to pass the magnitsky act, which targets those who commit human rights abuses in russia, reports the guardian. Having thus infuriated putin, browder says russia is now targeting him with an interpol arrest warrant, accusing him of killing magnitsky. \" it's all very scary … i definitely don't feel safe, \" browder told npr tuesday, noting the warrant — filed through an interpol loophole, per the eu observer — means he could be arrested and extradited to russia if he attempts to cross an international border. For a time, browder worried the us would be among the countries to arrest him after his authorization for visa-free travel to the us was revoked, per cnbc. The change led to objections from republican sen. John mccain and sen. Ben cardin, a democrat. But a trump administration official tells the new york times that the authorization was revoked automatically in response to the interpol notice. It has since been restored.

Young people and pregnant women especially are encouraged to pick up a box. The distribution of iodine, first announced two years ago, is joined by evacuation plans, a website informing people what to do in case of an emergency, and an emergency text system. A spokesperson for belgium's national crisis center says \" citizens must also prepare to help themselves the day something happens. \" belgium's nuclear plants are starting to crack and leak, and there was also a recent incident of sabotage that remains unsolved. The aging reactors are such a concern that belgium's neighbors are starting to act. Last year, a german city near the border distributed free iodine pills to half a million residents. Belgium's interior minister jan jambon says \" there is no specific risk \" from the plants at the moment, but they want to \" properly inform \" the public. A representative for the federal agency for nuclear control adds: \" the new emergency plan has not been issued in response to any perceived threats and does not indicate an increase in the risks associated with nuclear power plants in belgium. \"",

The photo, taken on july 10, 2013 — three months after he and his brother set off two bombs at the boston marathon — offered a rare glimpse into the mindset of tsarnaev, who has shown little — if any — emotion during the trial.

Should the government opt to enter the photo into evidence, it would then be released by prosecutors, sterling confirmed.

But a new one led by silicon valley venture capitalist tim draper has already gotten farther than most. Draper's plan to split california into three separate states of roughly equal population — northern california, from the bay area north to oregon; california, a coastal strip including los angeles; and southern california, stretching north to fresno and south to san diego — has received 420,000 valid signatures of support, enough for the issue to qualify for the november ballot, per the hill. \" this is really happening, \" the san jose mercury news puts it following tuesday's confirmation from california's secretary of state's office. But it won't be easy getting californians on board. Not only did draper previously launch a failed proposal to split california into six, but an april poll showed 72 % of registered state voters oppose his new plan. \" we need to empower our population to improve their government \" because it's \" rotted, \" draper tells the mercury news. He says his plan would fix high taxes, crumbling infrastructure, and overcrowded prisons, and describes the opposition as \" sacramento insiders who want to hold on to their power. \" but even with public support, draper's effort would need to pass the california legislature and congress. And as shifts in electoral college votes could see one of the three proposed states won by a republican, per the los angeles times, democrats will be hard to convince.

Navalny thanked his backers \" for making them release me, \" adding on twitter: \" even if it is temporary, let's use this time to shake up the swindlers. \" meanwhile, the obama administration has weighed in on the conviction, calling it \" politically motivated \" and saying it followed a \" disturbing trend of government actions aimed at suppressing dissent and civil society in russia. \"",

The shooters were a married couple in their 20s and the initial investigation has turned up swastikas and white supremacist paraphernalia, sources tell the las vegas review-journal. The sources say that after shooting the two police officers dead inside a pizza restaurant, the couple stripped them of their weapons and covered them with a cloth showing the revolutionary war-era gadsden flag, which features the words \" don't tread on me. \" at an apartment building being searched by police, neighbors described the couple as \" weird. \" they say the man — who sometimes dressed as peter pan to work as a street performer — rambled about conspiracy theories and spoke of wanting to kill police officers. One neighbor says the man claimed he \" had been kicked off cliven bundy's ranch \" while people gathered to protest a federal roundup of bundy's cattle, although the rancher's wife says there is no connection between the standoff and the vegas shooting. The two slain officers have been identified as alyn beck, 42, and igor soldo, 32.

Lanier expanded the window during which police are looking to know its movements: between wednesday and thursday at 5pm. That's roughly the time at which it was found burning behind a church in lanham, md; nbc washington reports police have said the chain of events leading to the four murders may have started wednesday.

When the thieves started siphoning about $ 100,000 a day from the account, patco says alarms were raised at the bank — but the bank didn't notice or heed them; instead of manually reviewing the red flags, the bank's system just asked challenge questions. The family-owned business didn't realize the problem until nearly $ 600,000 in fraudulent transfers were allowed to go through. The bank was able to block $ 240,000 of the transfers; the company lost the rest of the money. Patco claimed the bank should have used multi-factor authentication, but the bank said it did enough by verifying an authentic id and password.

            "A judge in maine has ruled that a bank that allowed hackers to steal more than $ 300,000 from a customer's online account isn't responsible for the lost money, saying the customer should have done more to protect the account credentials. Magistrate judge john rich sided with ocean bank in recommending that the u.s. District court in maine grant the bank's motions for a summary dismissal of a complaint filed by patco construction company. The ruling was reported monday by bankinfosecurity. The case raises questions about how much security banks and other financial institutions may be reasonably required to provide commercial customers.

            "A judge in maine has ruled that a bank that allowed hackers to steal more than $ 300,000 from a customer's online account isn't responsible for the lost money, saying the customer should have done more to protect the account credentials.

An audio statement on the extremist group's al-bayan radio station says that \" two soldiers of the caliphate \" carried out the sunday night attack; both men, identified yesterday as elton simpson and nadir soofi, were shot dead. The isis statement says: \" we tell america that what is coming is more bitter and harder and you will see from the soldiers of the caliphate what harms you. \" it did not provide details and it's unclear whether the group is opportunistically claiming the attack as its own. Usa today points out isis has never before claimed responsibility for an attack that occurred within the us. Simpson's family released a statement last night through their lawyers expressing their heartbreak. Nbc news has portions of it: \" we are sure many people in this country are curious to know if we had any idea of elton's plans. Without question, we did not. Just like everyone in our beautiful country, we are struggling to understand how this could happen. \" another name grabbing headlines in the attack's aftermath: event organizer and vocal critic of islam pamela geller. The event was held in response to a pro-muslim conference that occurred in garland in january. Geller told the washington post her group was \" prepared for violence \" ( it spent $ 50,000 on security for the 200-invitee event, which was staffed by 40 armed guards ). A subsequent post article observes that \" in tweets immediately after the shooting, geller appeared almost gleeful that she had been right. \" how she put it to cnn yesterday: \" civilized men can disagree.

The sunu band, which was released in august, is a wristband that emits a high-frequency sound wave that bounces off objects and back to the band, where it's translated into a vibration, the washington post explains. The closer an object is, the more frequent the vibration. \" one of my friends calls the device his'sixth sense, ' \" says fernando albertorio, one of the co-creators of sunu. According to mit technology review, albertorio, who is legally blind, has used the wristband to avoid objects while walking, find doorways, identity crosswalk buttons, and even run a 5k race. He says the \" feeling of independence \" is \" amazing. \" the sunu team hopes their invention changes how the visually impaired live. Albertorio says people who are blind can be afraid to go outside, but not only will sunu help them move about safely, it allows the visually impaired to \" blend in and be part of their community, \" unlike a traditional cane. The president of the perkins school for the blind says sunu could be a complementary tool to go along with canes and guide dogs and be especially useful for people who aren't completely blind. Albertorio says \" this is just the beginning. \" sunu eventually hopes to partner with facebook or google maps to give the visually impaired up-to-date information about the area through which they're traveling, including parks, transportation, and restaurants.

Prosecutors said meri woods of clymer, penn., downloaded more than 40 child-pornography images, then delivered the computer to state police and tried to frame her husband, matthew. But matthew was apparently out of the house when the images were downloaded, because she'd had him removed with a protection-from-abuse order, the ap reports. Seems the big point of dispute was over download dates: a police forensics expert testified that matthew was out of the house at the time, while a professor from canisius college in buffalo, ny, said the computer time stamps weren't dependable, the indiana gazette reports. But a jury of six men and six women needed less than two hours to find woods guilty. Now she faces up to nine years in prison and $ 20,000 in fines for sexual abuse of children, possessing child pornography, and lying to law enforcement. She might also have to become a registered sex offender in pennsylvania for 15 years.",

        "summary": "First, they discovered 3,000 skeletons dating back to the great plague. Now archaeologists excavating parts of an ongoing commuter railway project in london have uncovered skulls lined neatly on a roman road — and one lying between the legs of a headless skeleton, the telegraph reports. Other skulls discovered in the area apparently washed over from a nearby cemetery, but this is different: \" these discoveries can't all be explained by the natural environment, \" says jay carver, the project's head archaeologist. A former river running through a cemetery may have carried over some interred skulls, he says, \" but evidence is also mounting to support the theory that this part of london was an execution and display area. \" the nearby discovery of manacled wrists and shackles seems to support that, as does the existence of a now-buried roman amphitheater built in 120ad. After all, gladiators would cut off their opponents ' heads there. On the other hand, forbes reports, maybe these skulls once rested on the shoulders of rebels led by boudicca, the warrior queen of a british celtic tribe that killed roughly 70,000 occupying romans in 60ad. Or maybe celtic pagans, believing that heads contain a life force, cut them off in ritual dedication to the gods, the telegraph says. Whatever the answer, bioarchaeologists will be investigating the skulls for signs of injury or trauma. ( read about a couple that admits to planting goofy skeletons in the colorado river. )",

        "summary": "If you find it hard to doze off on your first night in unfamiliar surroundings, you're not alone — and it may be because you're like a dolphin. In a study published in current biology, brown university scientists found this type of sleep disturbance ( referred to as the \" first-night effect \" ) could be because the left side of the brain stays more alert than the right side, an evolutionary throwback that may have allowed our ancestors to sleep while still watching out for predators, npr reports. \" our brains may have a miniature system of what whales and dolphins have, \" says co-author yuka sasaki, per the telegraph, with the atlantic noting that some birds also have this ability to keep one half of their brain alert ( and even an eye open ) while asleep. The scientists studied the brain-wave patterns of 35 volunteers in a sleep lab, on two separate occasions a week apart, playing sounds in sleeping students ' ears. On the first night, slow-wave activity — indicating deep sleep — was lower in the left side of the brain, meaning it was likely more alert. On the second, the two sides were more closely matched. Scientists cited in the atlantic seem skeptical, noting the small sample size and the trial's failure to account for factors such as gender. Plus, there are outliers: insomniacs, for example, link their own bedrooms to their sleep grief, so they often sleep better when away from home, says a king's college london researcher, per new scientist. Sasaki notes some people, like those who travel often, may actually \" train \" their brains to turn night-guard mode off. In the meantime, researchers say there's not much the rest of us can do. \" if you need to be well-rested for an event, think about arriving two nights early, \" co-author masako tamaki says.

Indycar, struggling to compete with the more popular nascar, was attempting to make its races more exciting by increasing the risks: more drivers, pushed closer together via side-by-side racing, meaning a heightened possibility of collisions. The las vegas race, in particular, was promised to be \"wild \" due to a fast and smooth track, the wall street journal reports. Also increasing the buzz was a dangerous publicity stunt wheldon was taking part in, in which he would win $ 5 million if he could win after starting in last place. Drivers had concerns about the las vegas track, the ap adds: smooth corners encouraged drivers to maintain speed, ensuring that cars would bunch up around corners on the oval track; 34 drivers meant the largest field of the season — and some of them were relatively inexperienced; indycars had not raced on the track since 2000 and had very little time to prepare. In britain, tributes to wheldon were placed in his home village, the ap reports. His family was thanking supporters and remembering wheldon, who \"was born to be a racer and … left us doing what he loved, \" his father said. The coroner has concluded wheldon died of blunt trauma to the head. The other three drivers who were injured in the crash have been released from the hospital, yahoo! sports adds.",

        "summary": "More depressing news on the new york city subway last night, as two police officers were shot while stopping a man moving between cars on the brooklyn-bound n-train, reports the new york times. Two plainclothes cops asked the rider to leave the train with them, but, after initially appearing to do so, the man shot them both — one officer in the back, and the other in the thigh and groin. The former's bulletproof vest prevented more serious injury; he returned fire with seven shots, killing the man. Both cops are in the hospital now, in stable condition. It wasn't the only subway-related story in the times today: the paper also takes a look at the psychological battles that can plague those behind the controls. Dozens of people jump or fall to their deaths on the new york subways each year — 55 in 2012 — and images of the deaths can plague operators, who get three days off when a passenger is killed. Many take more unpaid time off to recover, and some never return to the job. \" as cruel as it makes it sound, for the individual it's over, \" says a former operator whose train killed a man in 1992. \" it's just beginning for the train operator. \" ( the times reports that a third police officer was also shot last night, while off duty at his family's car dealership in the bronx. The gunman and his accomplices were subdued and arrested. )",

It's kind of like a spitting image. \" the golfer claimed he went to a honolulu wine bar with friends, was lured to the parking lot ( under false pretenses ) after going to the bathroom, then beat up, put in a car's trunk, and dumped six miles away in a park, for reasons unclear. But there are some new twists and weirdness: in allenby's telling, a homeless woman came to his aid after seeing a number of men kicking him. Except charade keane told the honolulu star-advertiser yesterday that she found keane one block from the wine bar talking to two homeless men she knew who said allenby had hit his head on a rock. She did say the group began arguing when she arrived, and \" i realized this wasn't well. \" per golfweek, the golfer asked keane to tell the men he'd pay them $ 500 if they would return his stolen wallet and phone. She says the men didn't actually have his things, but asked her to lie to allenby and say they would exchange the items for the money. Keane says that made her realize they needed to split. The golf channel reports allenby has since texted a gc insider, saying, \" i ' m guessing she's getting paid. \" and honolulu police say they have security footage of a man buying alcohol with allenby's credit card. Two lingering questions: from australia's 9news: \" what happened during the three hours between when allenby left the wine bar at 11pm and when ms keane discovered him at 2am \"? and from deadspin: why didn't allenby's friend or his caddie, with whom he was out to dinner at the wine bar, think anything was up when he disappeared for hours while going to the bathroom?",

Mcgill university researchers explain that while men and women tend to go to bed and rise at roughly the same times, women have more trouble staying asleep — because their internal body clocks are dfferent, reports healthday news. \" women's body clock causes them to fall asleep and wake up earlier than men, \" says study author diane boivin of mcgill university in a release. \" the reason is simple: their body clock is shifted to a more easterly time zone. \" researchers came to that conclusion after measuring levels of sleep and alertness in 15 men and 11 women monitored over 36 hours. Female participants appeared more tired and therefore less alert at night than men, meaning they may be \" less biologically suited for night work \" and more likely to suffer work-related injuries, writes boivin. The female sleep signal was also weaker than the male signal at the end of a night, meaning women may have \" a difficult time staying asleep later in the night, \" says a ucla professor. \" perhaps women are predisposed to having insomnia based on their circadian phase. \" the study could also help explain why women tend to be more likely to feel drowsy during the day and more likely to suffer from sleep problems, researchers say.

Boivin shows, in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences ( pnas ), that the body clock affects sleep and alertness differently in men and women. \"for a similar sleep schedule, we find that women's body clock causes them to fall asleep and wake up earlier than men. The reason is simple: their body clock is shifted to a more easterly time zone, \" says the director of the centre for study and treatment of circadian rhythms at the douglas institute, one of the research centres of the ciusss de l ' ouest-de-l ' île-de-montréal. And, she adds, \"this observed difference between the sexes is essential for understanding why women are more prone to disturbed sleep than men. \" a novel experiment in this study, the medical researcher's team compared in 15 men and 11 women variations in sleep"

            "A panel of federal judges struck down north carolina's election districts for u.s. Congress on tuesday as unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders and gave lawmakers until jan. 29 to bring them new maps to correct the problem. The ruling comes in cases filed by the league of women voters and common cause in north carolina stemming from maps adopted in 2016 during a special legislative session. It throws a new wrinkle and more uncertainty into the 2018 election cycle in north carolina a month before candidates were scheduled to file for office. \"we're enormously gratified on behalf of our clients and all voters in north carolina that no one will have to endure another congressional election under an unconstitutional map, \" said allison riggs, senior voting rights attorney for the southern coalition for social justice, which represented some of the challengers. \"the court was clear in demanding a real remedy before the 2018 elections, and we expect the general assembly to respect that order. \" the judges – james a. Wynn, a barack obama appointee to the 4th u.s. Circuit court of appeals, and federal district judges w. Earl britt, a jimmy carter appointee, and william l. Osteen jr., a george w.

After her then-husband ultimately spotted her, four days later, \" clinging to bushes \" 180 feet down the side of a cliff, a coast guard helicopter crew airlifted her from the ridge in what koin calls a \" dramatic \" rescue that made headlines. This summer is also dramatic for the 28-year-old oregon woman, but in a decidedly different way: she has been charged with 96 felonies. Mounce is accused of stealing thousands of dollars from the dallas retirement village, oregon center for nursing, and openroad transportation, the statesman journal reports; she's also accused of stealing the identity of an \" elderly and dependent \" man whom she was caring for, along with $ 5,000 from him. She faces 62 counts of identity theft, 24 counts of criminal mistreatment, and 10 other charges; the charges date from september 2013 until july of this year. Authorities have not said whether there is any link to her disappearance in august of last year, but the polk county district attorney says an investigation into the case began about a year ago, per the polk county itemizer-observer. Authorities at the time said that she appeared to have left her car of her own free will and that they did not believe she had been abducted. She filed for divorce three months later. Of the charges she faces, the dallas retirement village says in a statement, \" we are working closely with the state and polk county attorney's office in their investigation of this individual and former employee....

        "summary": "Raids on a kidnapping operation in china has resulted in the rescue of 92 abducted children, a state-run media organization reports. The kids were rescued along with two women, while 300 gang members were arrested, reports the xinhua news agency, per afp. Kidnappers stole children in yunnan and sichuan provinces, then handed them off to deliverymen who would take them to other regions to be sold, according to the report. The bust happened two weeks ago, with local cops simultaneously hitting 11 different locations, but was only announced today. A gender imbalance due to china's one-child policy means kidnapped women are often sold in remote areas where men are unable to find wives, reuters reports. The policy also means some families will pay money for a male child if they can't conceive one on their own, reports al jazeera. Other kids may be sold to international adoption agencies. The news comes amid increasing public outrage over kidnappings, notes afp, but al jazeera says even a big bust like this one may not put a dent in the trade: some humanitarian agencies say as many as 70,000 chinese kids may be abducted every year.",

A traditional preference for boys, especially in rural areas, and a strict one-child policy have contributed to a rise in the trafficking of children and women in recent years. Kidnapped women are sold to men in remote areas who are unable to find brides due to a sex imbalance resulting from the draconian one-child policy, which has also encouraged sex-selective abortions.

        "summary": "Three years after a 13-year-old california girl was pronounced dead after tonsil surgery, a judge in alameda county has ruled that she may be alive, legally speaking. In an order released tuesday, alameda county superior court judge stephen pulido wrote that despite being declared dead by the county coroner's office in 2013, jahi mcmath may not satisfy the \" statutory definition of'dead ' under the uniform definition of death act, \" the east bay times reports. And a jury will make the determination as to whether she does or not, pulido ruled, reports the san francisco chronicle. It's good news for jahi's family, which is suing ucsf benioff children's hospital for malpractice after the operation in 2013 resulted in cardiac arrest and massive bleeding; she's been on life support since. The decision could have a big financial impact. California imposes a $ 250,000 cap on awards for wrongful-death claims regarding children but no cap on wrongful-injury claims; the court could, for instance, rule that jahi's medical costs need to be covered for the duration of her life. The chronicle has more on a june court filing in which a ucla professor said 49 videos taken by jahi's family over a 2-year period beginning in march 2014 show she is no longer brain dead and is improving, though she has irrevocable brain damage.

Until a more permanent fix is offered, apple suggests users create a short-cut replacement so whenever someone types \" i, \" it becomes \" i \" ( instructions are here ), which is better than gobbledygook. You can also install a third-party keyboard or turn off the predictive text feature. Unfortunately, this glitch isn't the only one ios 11 users have noticed. As quartz reports, the calculator app may not give accurate answers when numbers are added together in quick succession. Apple's watchos 4 also caused crashes when asked about the weather around daylight saving time, per the guardian.",

So indicate a batch of letters and stories that date back 150 years, recently uncovered by bob hirst and the university of california-berkeley's mark twain project, the guardian reports. Some writings were during twain's stint at the san francisco chronicle ( then the san francisco dramatic chronicle ), where part of his job was a 2,000-word column that would be taken by stagecoach to be printed in the territorial enterprise in nevada, the guardian notes. Researchers found about 110 of twain's columns dating from 1865 to 1866; topics ranged from trapped gold speculators to a police chief twain compared to a tail-chasing dog, the ap reports. Some of his harshest criticism was reserved for local cops, who twain suggested should be made out of wax, per the san francisco chronicle. \" wax figures, besides being far more economical, would be about as useful, \" he wrote. Hirst tells the ap, \" this is a very special period in his life. He's utterly free, he's not encumbered by a marriage... And he can speak his mind. \" however, hirst adds, twain was also at a crossroads: he was turning 30, in debt, indulging in alcohol, and not sure what to do next in his career. \" if i do not get out of debt in three months — pistols or poison for one — exit me, \" he wrote in an 1865 letter to his brother, per the washington post.

Two fans in nevada filed a lawsuit in federal court yesterday, claiming they were cheated by manny pacquiao's alleged failure to disclose a shoulder injury before the fight, reports reuters. The fans are seeking class-action status for the $ 5 million lawsuit, which they say they're filing on behalf of themselves and other ticket holders, tv viewers, and gamblers, reports the bbc. A lawyer for top rank, the promotions firm that represented pacquiao, tells cnbc that the suit is \" completely frivolous. \" \" nothing was concealed, and i expect it to be dismissed in due course, \" he says. Floyd mayweather jr., meanwhile, was hit with a $ 20 million lawsuit from ex-girlfriend josie harris yesterday, reports cnn. Harris, the mother of three of the boxer's children, accuses mayweather of lying during a recent interview with katie couric, where he claimed that harris was on drugs and he was only guilty of restraining her during a 2010 domestic violence incident. \" it was not mayweather's'restraint ' of harris that caused her serious injuries, rather it was his beating of her, \" the lawsuit states. Under a plea deal, mayweather served two months in prison for misdemeanor battery.",

Scientists at rutgers university, princeton university, and the woods hole oceanographic institution are reporting in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that, based on the accelerated rate of climate change in recent years, intense floods like the one caused by hurricane sandy will be at least three times more likely by the year 2100 as they are today, and that they could break particularly badly against new york city, making it up to 17 times as likely to experience such a flood by the year 2100. \" the grand answer is that things are going to get worse by 2100, \" one researcher says in a press release. \" it's just a question of how much worse it will get. There is no happy scenario. \" previous research has shown that, using historical patterns in the millennium between 850 and 1850 compared to the late 20th century, there has been a 20-fold increase in the frequency of extreme floods, largely due to rising sea levels. Now researchers report that while historic sea-level rise was largely due to natural events such as gradual land sinking following the ice age, the recent rise is due in large part to human-caused climate change and will make superstorms more common. Area residents tells cbs local that sandy was \" absolutely horrifying \" and \" devastating, \" and the researchers warn that such storms, expected once every 400 years in the year 2000, are likely to jump as high as once every 20 years by the year 2100.

Police intensified their manhunt for an unknown number of suspects still on the loose friday. They shot and killed five people early friday who were wearing fake bomb belts as they attacked the seaside resort of cambrils with a speeding car. Police also arrested four others believed linked to the cambrils attack and the carnage thursday on a famous barcelona promenade. The number of victims stood at 13 dead and 120 wounded in barcelona, and one dead and five wounded in cambrils. Sixty-one people wounded by the van in barcelona remained hospitalized on friday, with 17 of them in critical condition.

Nearly 30 cases of the current outbreak have resulted in hospitalization, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. Sold in various capsules and powders, kratom has gained popularity in the us as an alternative treatment for pain, anxiety, and drug dependence. But the fda has been cracking down on the ingredient, which is made from a plant native to southeast asia. The agency says that kratom has no approved medical use and chemically resembles an opioid, the class of addictive drugs behind the current nationwide epidemic of drug abuse. State and federal officials detected salmonella in a half-dozen samples of triangle's products. But the company refused to allow fda inspectors to access the company's records or discuss the contamination issue, according to an agency statement. The fda notified the company on friday that it had 24 hours to halt distribution and begin its own recall of kratom-containing products, such as raw form organics maeng da kratom emerald green. The fda said it ordered the recall on monday after the company did not respond. This week's action marks the first time the fda has ever formally ordered a food recall. Congress gave the fda that authority in 2011 after a series of high-profile food outbreaks involving peanut butter, spinach and other grocery staples.

Musical wunderkind clara rockmore was accepted into the st. Petersburg imperial conservatory in russia at the age of 4 — its youngest violinist ever, the telegraph reports. But she made her mark on music when she moved to the us in 1921 and took up the theremin, according to vox. Search engine land reports playing the violin had become too hard on rockmore physically ( she had developed arthritis ), but the recently invented theremin required no physical contact to play. Instead, players use their hands to manipulate a magnetic field created by the instrument's two antennas. \" i was fascinated by the aesthetic part of it, the visual beauty, the idea of playing in the air, \" rockmore is quoted on her foundation's website. She was a major force in popularizing the theremin — the world's first electronic instrument — playing as a soloist for the new york philharmonic and others. She also helped léon theremin refine and improve his invention. As vox puts it, rockmore \" was the skrillex of her day. \" the theremin inspired bands like the rolling stones, led zeppelin, and the beach boys and led to the creation of the modern synthesizer. Wednesday's google doodle is not only a history lesson, it's a playable theremin. It took a dozen google employees to create and mimics the sound and look of theremins from rockmore's era. The doodle celebrates what would have been rockmore's 105th birthday; she died in 1998.",

Thousands of protesters, some holding signs denouncing the violence in charlottesville, gathered along fifth avenue ahead of the president's return to trump tower in new york city, the washington post reports. Protesters shouted \" shame \" and \" new york hates you, \" while a smaller group of a few dozen trump supporters gathered near the plaza, chanting \" god bless president trump, \" the ap reports. Police, who kept the rival groups of demonstrators apart, said three arrests were made for disorderly conduct, cnn reports.

In this ad, as a parody of the beastie boys hit \" girls \" plays, the little girls in the commercial put together a rube goldberg-esque chain reaction machine.

As the hollywood reporter notes, to determine whether fair use applies, a judge will consider — among other things — \" the purpose and character of the use. \" which, inspiring though the video may be, is...

In a boston globe opinion piece last week on the spectra energy project, gore called for the stepping up of efforts to stop using fossil fuels and warned of the dangers of running a pipeline through a residential neighborhood that's already close to an open-pit quarry. \" forcing local residents to live with a gas pipeline running underground right next to a place where rocks are regularly blown up with dynamite illustrates the perversity of the power at work here, \" she wrote.

David eisenhauer and natalie keepers, both 19, are accused of plotting to kill 13-year-old nicole lovell and could be sentenced to life in prison without parole when their cases go to trial next march, the washington post reports. Prosecutors haven't said why the freshmen engineering majors would have wanted to kill the teen, though law enforcement sources have told the post that eisenhauer had an inappropriate relationship with nicole, a liver transplant recipient whose disappearance on jan. 27 this year led to a frantic search because she didn't have her medication, nbc news notes. Eisenhauer, who allegedly slit the girl's throat after she sneaked out of her house to meet him, was indicted on charges of kidnapping and first-degree murder, as well as a fresh charge of concealing a body, wdbj reports. Keepers, who has told investigators she was not present when nicole was murdered, was indicted on charges of concealment and being an accessory before the fact. Prosecutors say they're unable to pursue the death penalty against eisenhauer because there's no evidence that he had sexual contact with the girl on the day of the kidnapping, the ap reports. ( police have described eisenhauer as a \" sociopath \" and keepers as a \" sociopath in training. \" )",

So he will celebrate in true political fashion: spending \"downtime, \" as an e-mail invitation put it, at a party at his chicago home with a bunch of strangers who made campaign donations to be there. That party, on aug. 12, will mark another milestone in the transformation of the president and his wife, who once tried to limit the role of politics in their lives and now seem to be increasingly giving themselves over to it. Even some longtime obama fund-raisers expressed surprise over the party's site: the obamas have limited their schmoozing hours in washington, sequester themselves while on vacation and seldom invite many outsiders into the white house living quarters. Until now, they have kept their chicago home mostly sacrosanct, allowing only limited photographs of the interior. The party raises questions about how far the obamas will go in mortgaging their personal appeal for political gain in the months ahead. In poll after poll, voters give mr. Obama higher marks as a person — a trustworthy leader, a committed father — than as a steward of the economy. Aside from their house, how much of themselves are the obamas willing to offer up? consider the shift in mr. Obama's birthday celebrations since he arrived in office in",
