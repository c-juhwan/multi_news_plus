        "summary": "Thousands of years ago some mosquitoes made \" a really good evolutionary move \": they developed a taste for humans. A new study digs into the genes that led to this evolutionary shift, which had many mosquitoes give up on furry forest animals — and it relied on guinea pigs and pantyhose to reach its conclusion. As rockefeller university explains, school researchers studied two types of mosquitoes in rabai, kenya, whose disparate behavior was first observed in the 1960s. Aedes aegypti formosus ( black mosquitoes ) favor forest creatures, while the brown-bodied aedes aegypti aegypti prefer humans. The researchers headed to rabai five years ago, collected mosquito larvae, and confirmed those preferences were still the case after breeding them in the lab. They then began a process of cross-breeding and sorting that ultimately allowed them to identify an odor-receptor gene, or4, that was much more highly expressed in human-preferring mosquitoes. To suss out which odor or4 was homing in on, the researchers had human volunteers and guinea pigs don pantyhose for 24 hours. A machine then sorted out each individual chemical, and one called sulcatone was present only in the stockings worn by humans. But the researchers note that sulcatone alone can't explain the preference; they added sulcatone to guinea pig odor and the brown-bodied mosquitoes showed no increased preference for the odor. Still, the researchers write in nature that \" our results provide a rare example of a gene contributing to behavioral evolution. \" ( meet the parasite that feasts on mosquitoes ' blood. )",

But then, thousands of years ago, some of these bloodsuckers made a smart switch: they began biting humans and hitchhiked all over the globe, spreading disease in their wake. \"it was a really good evolutionary move, \" says leslie b.

We always have water around for them to breed in, we are hairless and we live in large groups. \" to understand the evolutionary basis of this attraction, vosshall and her colleagues examined the genes that drive some mosquitoes to prefer humans. Their findings, published in the november 13 issue of nature, suggest that human-loving mosquitos are attracted to our scent. \"they've acquired a love for human body odor, and that's a key step in specializing on us, \" she says.

But the company now believes the hack was less serious than initially feared, and no credit or debit card numbers were stolen, the bbc reports.

        "summary": "If your initial reaction is one of queasiness, it would be understandable: a new technique announced monday in nature methods essentially allows scientists to make dead mice see-through — by stripping the lipids and water from the animals'tissues. The fat is what makes the tissues opaque; the removal of water is part of a shrinking process that leaves the body as little as 35 % of its original size, which enables it to fit under a microscope, reports nbc news. The result is \" like a transparent plastic mouse that you can bend, \" neuroscientist ali erturk tells the wall street journal, and the implications could be huge. Scientists can currently get a look at the inside of animals with lo-res techniques like mri, or can slice tissue into slivers to view under a microscope. With ultimate disco or udisco, scientists can use fluorescent proteins to \" light up \" specific cells, organs, or systems, providing a high-res, system-wide view. And here's a problem with tissue slicing: popular science explains \" cells are often too long to fit onto a tissue section, \" and so when it comes to studying neurons, \" you are cutting the wires, \" says erturk. \" this will help us a lot with neuroscience, and especially diseases like alzheimer's, parkinson's, or ms and als, where the neural connectivity is lost, \" he tells motherboard. And then there's the time-intensive nature of it: imaging wafer-thin slices of a mouse brain with an electron microscope and putting them together would take 50 years to complete, versus eight days to map a mouse brain with udisco. The slice-approach would take 1,000 years for a human brain, erturk says, and using his technique on the human brain is the ultimate goal. \" so far there is not any approach that even comes close to mapping any part of human brain at individual neuron level. \"",

But it was a smoking gun delayed: clifford tells cnn he initially identified the wreck in 2003 but \" misdiagnosed \" the cannon there; it was only two years ago, after time spent learning about the cannons of columbus ' age, that he \" woke up suddenly in the middle of the night \" realizing what he might have found.

Carell is \" effective \" and tierney \" outstanding, \" but chalamet shines.

She's \" alive onscreen, with several different emotions — guilt, grief, irritation, and more guilt — passing over her face in an instant, \" he writes.

That's it, \" a rep for mendes says. Sounds like the brits just can't — or won't — deal with the fact that their favorite celeb couple, kate winslet and sam mendes, are splitting without acrimony. Juicy rumors started swirling in the u.k. Yesterday that 27-year-old actress rebecca hall is the reason the couple split after seven years. Reports in the daily mail suggest that mendes had become enamored of the very pretty brunette after working with her in his 2006 flick \" starter for 10, \" and even more so when she starred in his bridge project theater company shows in new york and london, which the reports claim made kate uncomfortable. \" when kate found out that sam had grown close to rebecca, she was upset. Rebecca is totally sam's type — a thespian mix of brains and beauty, \" a source \" close to winslet \" told the paper. The only problem: friends of both mendes and hall say it just ain't so. \" yes, they know each other, but that's about it, \" says an insider close to hall, who insists, \" rebecca has absolutely nothing to do with their split. \" in fact, says the source, \" she's friends with kate, too. \"",
            "Kate winslet's split from husband of seven years sam mendes has been a long time coming, a source tells usmagazine.com. Apparently, the relationship first showed signs of trouble while the two -- who announced they were splitting on march 15 -- were filming revolutionary road in 2007. Do kate winslet and these stars look better after their breakups? \" sam told friends kate would talk about the film the moment they woke up, and it was overbearing, \" the source says. Things worsened when winslet, 34, and mendes, 44, took time off in 2009 to be together. See kate winslet's hottest red carpet looks \" they went stir-crazy and argued more than ever, \" the source tells us. The stars finally decided \" it was over \" when winslet agreed to shoot a miniseries, mildred pierce, in new york city even though mendes wanted to remain in london. See 2009's most shocking splits the source says, \" kate told sam, ' your career is not more important than mine. \" for more of the week's hottest new stories, pick up the newest issue of us weekly, on newsstands today!"

We told her repeatedly that we simply cannot afford out-of-state tuition. \" ricci's lawyer tells a different story, saying that the \" nicest thing \" her parents have said about their child is that she's a \" spoiled brat. \" he claims mcgarvey kicked her out and tells the washington post ricci \" desperately wants her family back. \" ( in other tuition news, we've overlooked a major student-debt problem. )",

But it's not because aquarium staff came to the conclusion that it's weird to invite a bunch of people to come watch octopi do it. Rather, they pulled the plug on the event — a feb. 14 mainstay for a decade — because they were concerned the male octopus would eat his mate, komo news reports. Weighing in at 70 pounds, kong was just too much octopus for his female counterparts, who weighed 30 to 40 pounds. \" there's a chance he would see her as food, \" the aquarium's tom carpenter tells crosscut. It could be that kong dodged a bullet: octopi are \" terminal breeders, \" meaning that both males and females of the species die shortly after mating. So instead, the aquarium let visitors watch kong swim around with a diver on valentine's day, and later planned to return him to puget sound. In any event, there's no telling what would have happened had the show been allowed to go on. \" a blind date is a blind date, \" carpenter says, \" and you never know how it's going to go. \" lovemaking itself can be dangerous for the males, too. Researchers in indonesia have observed a female octopus basically strangle her mate during coitus and drag him to her den to eat him. ( on the other hand, this little octopus is a romantic. )",

Each valentine's day the aquarium invites people to watch the sea creatures mate, but seattle aquarium officials tell komo news that this year, the chance to watch some 8-armed nooky has been called off. Aquarium staff say they're afraid that their male octopus - a 70-pound cephalopod named kong - is too big for the females who are 30 to 40 pounds, and he may eat them. So much for romance! instead of mating, kong will be released back into the puget sound monday at noon. Octopuses only live about three or four years and mate once at the end of their lives.

It begins, \" the ninth week of donald trump's presidency began with the f.b.i. Director calling him a liar, \" and doesn't let up. \" our president is a liar, \" writes leonhardt, who ticks off a list of topics he says trump has lied about, including \" obama's birthplace, john f. Kennedy's assassination, sept. 11, the iraq war, isis, nato, military veterans, mexican immigrants, muslim immigrants, \" and his list goes on. On russia, then, leonhardt says don't bother listening to what the president or his aides say, because they're going to lie. Just hope comey or congress ( leonhardt says the onus here will fall on senate republicans ) can uncover the truth. Read the piece in full here. Other takes on the testimony: wall street journal: comey didn't actually say much, other than handing democrats \" the headline they wanted, \" says an editorial. Yes, trump overstated his wiretapping claims, but somebody leaked details of michael flynn's conversations with the russian ambassador, and flynn deflected questions on that. The intel committee should be prepared to declassify more information than usual because \" the public needs to know if there was political canoodling with a foreign government and whether the obama administration used cloak-and-dagger methods for partisan purposes. \" read it here. Washington post: the editorial board roasts house republicans for trying to shift the story to be about leaks and \" slavishly following the cues of the president \" in trying to deflect attention. Read it here. Politico: \" comey's admission of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation, with no endpoint in sight, is a big deal, \" it quotes historian timothy naftali as saying. \" this is not going away. \" the story on how the investigation could \" dog \" trump's presidency is here.

Seven children have been hospitalized with oral cellulitis, an infection that can spread to gum and bone, after a routine pulpotomy or \" baby root canal \" at children's dental group, reports the orange county register. Each patient developed abscesses that took up to six months to materialize, per cbs news. In one case, a 3-year-old boy had to undergo an operation to remove an abscess that was only detected after his teacher noticed his face was swollen. Oral cellulitis is typically eradicated with intravenous antibiotics or surgery but can be life-threatening. Officials suspect water used during the procedure may have been contaminated. They're now contacting 500 other children who had pulpotomies at the clinic since may. \" i have not seen these types of cases in the 10 years that i've been here, \" says an official at the orange county health care agency. \" it's very resistant to treatment and needs to be taken care of quickly. \" however, he says the risk of infection in other patients is low. Just 1 % of patients became infected in a similar outbreak tied to pulpotomies at a georgia clinic last year.

            "( again ) it's crazy enough that we live in a world where someone was paid to photoshop pubes onto a photograph of justin bieber. But it's even crazier that this happened on an ad that was literally made for instagram — a platform that won't even allow pubic hair at all if it's attached to a woman. Instagram exposed its double standard yet again last week when it pulled a photo posted by awesome australian store/blog/styling agency sticks &amp; stones.

They don't like nekkid ladies skiing on a mountain. They do not like them here or there. They do not like them anywhere. Australian online magazine sticks and stones learned this the hard way when it posted an image of two women in bathing suits that partially displayed their pubic hair, prompting instagram to yank its account without warning. Here's the photo in all its ' 70s, full-bush glory: sticks and",
            "If most instagram users are women, why are female bodies the first to get censored? that's what australian online magazine sticks and stones was left wondering after a photo showing women's pubic hair was censored by instagram and its account was deleted. Although it had racked up hundreds of thousands of loyal followers, the agency's latest shoot was enough to cost the company its account. Ainsley hutchence, the agency's director, believes their account would have never been censored if the pubic hair had belonged to a man. \" unfortunately instagram has ruled out natural hair that appears on all bodies of women that don",

Needless to say, there are some major spoilers below. Let's get right to \" eastwatch, \" the fifth episode of season seven: that big reveal came during a reading lesson of sam tarly's partner, gilly. As she works her way through the records in front of her, a distracted sam half-listening, she asks, \" what's an annulment? \" and then proceeds to read out loud about a prince who voided his marriage and legally remarried another woman — that prince being rhaegar targaryen and that other woman being jon snow's mother, lyanna stark, meaning jon snow would now be the rightful heir to the iron throne. Harper's bazaar compiles reactionary tweets to that scene, many focusing on men interrupting women, while cinemablend offers further context. Speaking of other illegitimate sons: gendry ( son of robert baratheon ) is back, and time notes he returned \" in a big way. \" actor joe dempsie, who plays the hammer-wielding character, explains to huffpost where the heck gendry's been since his last appearance in season three. Another possibly big reveal, but also possibly a cersei lie: she's allegedly pregnant with jaime's child, their fourth together. Vulture breaks down why she may be fibbing. Arya broke into littlefinger's room to steal a scroll she saw he had while spying on him, but littlefinger apparently wanted her to find it all along. Business insider reveals what the scroll said and what littlefinger's master plan is, according to showrunner db weiss. How the episode ended: with what the hollywood reporter calls a setting of the stage for the show's \" most important battle yet. \" and that scene involved jon snow and a ragtag group of travelers ( including jorah marmont, gendry, the hound, tormund, and others ) heading beyond the wall to capture … a zombie wight from the white walker ranks.

Researchers at the university of melbourne in australia surveyed 315 same-sex parents, the majority of them lesbians, and found a 6 % higher level of health and cohesion than in the general population, raw story reports. \" that's really a measure that looks at how well families get along, \" says lead researcher simon crouch. He pointed to previous research that same-sex households distribute home and work roles \" more equitably \" than straight households: \" what this means is that people take on roles that are suited to their skill sets rather than falling into those gender stereotypes, which is mum staying home and looking after the kids and dad going out to earn money, \" he says. But roslyn phillips at family voice australia downplayed the study, saying she \" wasn't surprised \" the parents \" all thought their children were doing well, \" and argued that a more effective study would look at the grown-up children of same-sex couples, abc news australia reports. She also noted that crouch is raising two children himself with a gay partner. But crouch responded that he's primarily a doctor and researcher whose \" objectivity...

That includes its stronghold in raqqa, syria, also in danger of falling, along with pockets of mosul. Al jazeera estimates that 100,000 civilians remain trapped in those mosul neighborhoods, making the final push to oust militants complicated.

His mother told detectives etan had a dollar with him so he could buy a soda, and the daily beast points out that the bodega next to the bus stop, where pedro hernandez was a 19-year-old stock clerk, would have been a logical place for him to stop. The neighborhood was a gritty one at the time, and a longtime resident tells the new york times the seedy bodega had a \" hostile \" feeling and was rumored to host cockfights in the basement. So why didn't investigators, knowing hernandez worked at the store, ever interrogate him? that's the question the daily beast raises, though it offers no clear answers. Hernandez, now 51 and charged with etan's murder, says he lured the boy to the store's basement by promising him a soda, strangled him, and threw his body out with the trash. Nypd commissioner raymond kelly says hernandez has not provided a motive, and adds that there is \" no reason at this time \" to suspect hernandez sexually abused the boy, nbc new york reports. One law enforcement source says hernandez had already confessed when etan first disappeared but investigators wrote him off as a \"lunatic, \" but kelly insists that is not true and says police were informed about hernandez's possible involvement only recently. Hernandez reportedly has gone back to the old bodega building, now an eyeglass store, with detectives — but it will be near-impossible to recover any remains. For that and other reasons, the case is far from solved, a law enforcement official tells the new york times. Hernandez \" is lucid, he's persuasive.

The charge comes 33 years to the day that patz disappeared off a soho street in a tragic case that mystified new york city for decades. According to the criminal complaint, hernandez told police he strangled patz and placed him inside a plastic bag, causing his death. His court-appointed lawyer, harvey fishbein, told the court that hernandez is a schizophrenic",
            "Back from london, the police commissioner, raymond w. Kelly, stepped in front of the cameras in prime time thursday evening to announce that the police were accusing pedro hernandez of killing etan patz in 1979. The mayor, michael r. Bloomberg, had weighed in a few hours earlier, declaring that \"we \" had a suspect in custody. That wasn't even the first word of the day: the police commissioner had beaten the mayor to it, issuing a statement at 6: 30 in the morning, before he got on a jet in london. The boy disappeared 33 years ago, the suspect had been in custody for barely a day, after decades of false starts, but already the publicity engine was outracing the actual investigation or filing of charges. \"people heard the word 'confession ' and they think that's it, the case is solved, \" a law"

Kfor explains the married tulsa dentist is to stand trial for the july 2016 death of lincoln lewis, the 19-month-old child of the woman he'd been dating for about a year. Franklin is accused of throwing the toddler to the ground and kicking him; the police report described a \" severe \" injury to the child's head, reports kotv. On monday — in a move that franklin's lawyer had no idea was coming — prosecutors said they were ready to file another charge against him: conspiracy to commit murder. Per a court affidavit cited by the oklahoman, they allege that franklin approached an inmate in the oklahoma county jail and inquired about \" the possibility of killing a witness in the murder case. \" that witness, say prosecutors, was franklin's mistress and the toddler's mother, roxanne lewis randall. Prosecutors say the inmate franklin spoke to was an informant who spoke to investigators. Other informants became involved, with franklin ultimately being given a recordable cellphone by one and allegedly convincing his wife to move $ 300 into the account of another for, he told her, \" spiritually related reasons. \" the affidavit alleges that on friday, franklin placed a call to a third inmate who wasn't incarcerated and provided directions to randall's house and details regarding her security cameras and large dog. The prosecution, which last week offered franklin a plea deal that would have him serve 30 years ( he turned it down ), are expected to push to try the two charges together.

        "summary": "In what the los angeles times describes as a \" rare \" move, social workers have been charged with a crime following the death of a child. Gabriel fernandez, 8, died in palmdale in 2013 after his mother and her boyfriend allegedly tortured him — pepper spraying him, making him eat his vomit, stuffing a sock in his mouth and trapping him in a cabinet, and eventually allegedly beating him to death with a wooden club. Several agencies had looked into abuse claims at gabriel's home in the months before his death, but no one removed him from the home and his case was closed shortly before he died. Gabriel's mother and her boyfriend have been charged with murder and are awaiting trial. Prosecutors say the social workers knew gabriel had a bb pellet in his chest, and had written a suicide note, but never sent him to get a mental health assessment or medical care. Stefanie rodriguez, patricia clement, kevin bom, and gregory merritt have each been charged with child abuse and falsifying public records, felonies that carry a total possible prison sentence of 10 years, cbs la reports. Rodriguez and clement are charged with falsifying the reports so the escalating physical abuse gabriel was suffering was not shown, and prosecutors say supervisors bom and merritt approved the reports when they should have known they were falsified, abc 7 reports. \" social workers play a vital role in society. We entrust them to protect our children from harm, \" the da says in a statement. \" we believe these social workers were criminally negligent and performed their legal duties with willful disregard for gabriel's well-being. \"",

Hamza — a somali-american who attended a local high school but was also enrolled at seattle central college as part of an accelerated state program — fell off the balcony of an apartment near the college, and some in the city's muslim community are now claiming he was beaten and pushed to his death by a white man, per the new york times. The king county medical examiner hasn't released the cause or manner of death, the seattle times notes, but some are branding it a hate crime. Recent attacks in the us and abroad have been exacerbated by statements in the political arena, especially from donald trump, who's said he'd support a database to track muslims and that the us should ban all muslims from entering. Kuow reports hamza's parents say police have put forth a \" minimal \" response, and were told no one had been assigned to their son's case. \" this really … angered the parents — why the police treat this case like it's nothing, \" the manager of hamza's college program says. The seattle pd is imploring the public to \" be patient and avoid jumping to conclusions \" while it investigates. Meanwhile, supporters of hamza's family have set up a facebook page and twitter hashtag of #justice4hamza. \" he was not suicidal, \" hamza's sister tells the new york times. \" i want my brother's investigation to be put on a priority. \"",

They flirted a little — he took two pictures of her, she snapped some of him — and then she and her date went back to the dance floor. \"it was like, one of those things where you're aware of the other person all night, \" she said. \"we would catch eyes every now and then. \" they ran into each other one last time, right as grace was leaving.

        "summary": "A shipwreck in the english channel may have yielded quite a treasure: scientists think they've found a viking sunstone, the mythical navigational aid viking mariners used to locate the sun and traverse the sea before compasses were developed. A crystal found in the wreck of a british ship that sunk off the island of alderney in 1592 could have been used as a sunstone, they say, according to the bbc. Sunstones were once considered \" mystical, \" since they were said to be able to pinpoint the sun's position even through the clouds, but a 2011 study found the stones were actually real. The crystal, an oblong shape about the size of a pack of cigarettes, was found near the navigational equipment. And it's an icelandic spar, the type of crystal scientists say the vikings used, because it can diffract light into two distinct rays. Scientists tested a similar crystal and found it was indeed possible to determine the direction of the sun by finding the point where the rays converge, even after the sun has set. Though the british ship on which the crystal was found sailed long after the viking era, scientists think sunstones continued to be used for centuries as a backup to the compass. As for why no intact sunstone has been found at a viking burial site, scientists think that could be because the crystals shattered when warriors were cremated, the independent reports.",

Biden, whose eldest son died at the end of may, said he wasn't sure if he could devote his heart and soul to a run or if he had the \" emotional energy. \" the biggest factor, he said, is, \" can i do it? can my family undertake what is an arduous commitment that we'd be proud to undertake in ordinary circumstances? the honest to god answer is i just don't know. \" for now, biden appears to be testing the waters in what politico calls a campaign of \" plausible deniability. \" he's been staying away from early voting states, but his schedule for the next week includes a labor day parade in pittsburgh and a stephen colbert interview, as well as official duties. Biden supporters say he still has plenty of time to enter — and upend — the democratic race before the oct. 13 debate. \" everything that happened before the vice president entered the race would be pre-biden and everything once he got in would be post-biden, \" a former biden staffer in iowa tells politico. \" they'd be two different races. \" ( this columnist thinks \" vice candidate \" would be an ideal role for biden. )",

        "summary": "A civil rights lawyer on monday claimed there was \" significant evidence to substantiate \" his client's claim she was raped by a texas state trooper. Two days later, he said the trooper \" should be cleared of any wrongdoing. \" it was an about-face spurred by the release of a bodycam video from 37-year-old sherita dixon-cole's dwi arrest early sunday near dallas, which \" appalled \" authorities say disproves the \" spurious and false accusations, \" per the washington post. Though he'd shared claims that dixon-cole was offered special treatment for sex, then raped while \" steps were taken to obscure video evidence, \" lee merritt found it impossible to argue with almost two hours of footage, reports the fort worth star-telegram. It \" directly conflicts with the accounts reported to my office \" and offers \" no readily apparent evidence of tampering, \" the lawyer now says. Indeed, the camera rolls as dixon-cole is pulled over, asked to perform sobriety tests, handcuffed, and taken to jail. \" outside of personal information being blurred out, the video appears to be in its original form, \" writes journalist shaun king, who amplified dixon-cole's allegations in since-deleted tweets. Though he notes her arrest was \" arguably unwarranted \" as she passed two breathalyzer tests, king now says dixon-cole's apparently false report was \" awful. \" it's unclear if she ' ll face charges. On wednesday, as king revealed dixon-cole was sticking to her story, ellis county's district attorney said his office was still looking into \" what was said and who it was said to, \" per the dallas morning news. For his part, merritt has apologized to the accused trooper and his family, claiming \" full responsibility for amplifying these claims to the point of national concern. \"",

Below are two different views on whether this kind of thing is ok: good move: it's unusual for protesters to target public officials in their private lives, but jessica valenti at the guardian argues that it's justified here. \" when you're talking about the kind of human rights violations the trump administration has unabashedly enacted and defended, there is no public/private line worth honoring, \" she writes. \" when it comes to kids in cages, you're not just accountable for your actions from 9 to 5. \" she flips the argument that the treatment of sanders and the others is uncivil. It's their policies that are uncivil, and members of society are letting them know: \" there's nothing more ' civil'than that. \" too far: the editorial page of the washington post is one of the president's fiercest critics, but it argues that trump officials should be allowed to \" eat in peace. \" justifying the behavior by saying this is a \" special moment \" is a slippery slope. \" how hard is it to imagine, for example, people who strongly believe that abortion is murder deciding that judges or other officials who protect abortion rights should not be able to live peaceably with their families? \" if we follow this path, \" only the most zealous \" will become public servants, and \" that benefits no one. \"",

What you need to know about the 159-page joint comprehensive plan of action, a deal that president obama this morning emphasized \" is not built on trust. It is built on verification \": iran will get rid of 98 % of its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, to a level of no more than about 660 pounds, for 15 years. That ' ll happen by diluting its stockpile or shipping it out of iran, per the guardian. Obama today explained that its current stockpile could fuel 10 nuclear weapons; under the new limitation, iran would have a fraction of what would be required for a single weapon. It will \" remove two-thirds of its installed centrifuges and store them under constant international supervision, \" per obama. The affect of the aforementioned stipulations, per the new york times \" the limits... Would extend, to one year, the amount of time necessary for iran to produce enough weapons-grade material for a single bomb if it should abandon the accord. \" the relief iran will see once the international atomic energy agency has confirmed the country is beginning to take the agreed-upon steps: a lifting of international sanctions related to finance, oil, shipping, and more ( one line references the importation into the us of iranian-origin carpets, pistachios, and caviar ). An arms embargo will also be lifted in future years. \" all these sanctions will snap back into place \" if iran violates the deal, per obama. Iaea inspectors \" will be able to access any suspicious location, \" per obama. The guardian explains that iran can object to an iaea request to inspect a location where undeclared nuclear activity is allegedly happening, but a multinational commission can, through a majority vote, override that. Speaking of votes, obama warned that he \" will veto any legislation [ from congress ] that prevents the successful implementation of this deal....

        "summary": "A gun control bill — though it's not clear which one — is expected to hit the senate floor this week, and the latest republican to threaten it is mitch mcconnell. The minority leader joins a group of gop colleagues, now numbering 13, who intend to filibuster any gun bill that comes to the floor, politico reports. Mcconnell says, through his spokesperson, that if harry reid files a cloture motion, mcconnell \" will oppose cloture on proceeding to that bill. \" meanwhile, things are coming down to the wire for senate democrats, who will have to advance their own gun control bill if they cannot come up with a bipartisan compromise in time, the ap reports. They will meet today to discuss the joe manchin-pat toomey deal, and are expected to reach a decision on which bill to advance in the next couple days. More on the gun control front: some state and local officials are using new taxes as a form of gun control, politico reports. In chicago, there's now a $ 25 tax on all firearms purchases. California, new jersey, nevada, and maryland are all considering new taxes on gun and ammo sales. New york's mayor bloomberg is taking a different tack: he's grading lawmakers based on their gun control stance, much as the nra does. Politicians will be given a grade of a through f, with better grades going to those who are more pro-gun control, the washington post reports. The system could worry democrats from conservative states, who often feel they must vote against gun control measures. Of course, gun rights groups aren't taking any of this lying down, politico reports. In fact, some groups are going after even those republicans who have received an a grade from the nra, in an attempt to make sure they don't even consider a compromise with democrats on background checks. Meanwhile, president obama was in connecticut last night, vowing that he's as \" determined as ever \" to get a gun control bill.",

        "summary": "Turns out that offering patrons lower-calorie options isn't just a good move for waistlines, it's a \" business imperative \" for restaurants, says the lead author of a new study. The report from the hudson institute finds that sales were up 5.5 % between 2006 and 2011 at restaurants that increased their healthy menu choices and down by 5.5 % at those that didn't, reports the wall street journal. It holds true for both fast-food and sit-down restaurants. \" the bottom line is, if restaurants don't get more aggressive behind these low-calorie products, they're leaving sales on the table, \" says the study's author. The results dovetail with new federal rules that will soon require chains with more than 20 stories to post calorie counts. Mcdonald's and others already have begun doing so. The healthier alternatives include smaller portions slices, like the \" skinny slice \" at sbarro, notes the new york times.",

Mizanskey's attorney says the sentence is \" cruel \" and, \" thank goodness, it's relatively unusual, \" and adds that the governor's move sends a \" strong signal \" to the parole board that freedom is appropriate.

Authorities have installed a new device called the \" electronic police \" at intersections in cities in four provinces. Not only does it detect when people are jaywalking, but it snaps photos of the offenders and uses facial recognition tech to pull up their images in the provincial police database, reports rt. Once police confirm a match, the person isn't just flagged for the offense ( they can choose whether to pay a fine, take a safety class, or volunteer with traffic police ). Their photo and personal details, including parts of their id number and home address, are displayed on a large screen for all passersby to see. Facial recognition has already been used in china to catch toilet paper thieves in public restrooms and to predict orders at the fast food chain kfc, reports the afp. But the use of public shaming takes things to a whole new level — one that local police say is proving effective. They say public shaming can go so far as to impact insurance and pension premiums, and police in the city of jinan say they've caught more than 6,200 people crossing at red lights since installing the system in early may ( yes, that's less than two months ), with the number of incidents dropping ten-fold from 200 per day to 20. Jinan is looking to install the system at 50 other major intersections by the end of june, each costing the city roughly $ 15,000, reports mashable.

Her resignation is effective sept. 3. President obama said in a statement that romer's decision was guided by \" family commitments. \" romer has long signaled that her time in washington would be temporary; her husband, economist david romer, has been on leave from his own post at berkeley and their teenage son is due to start high school this fall. Romer is also considered a serious candidate to replace janet yellen as president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco, one of the most important jobs in the fed system. Yellen was recently named vice chairman of the federal reserve. Romer, 51, is one of the nation's leading scholars of macroeconomic history and an expert on the great depression. She was tapped by obama to serve as chief economist for the white house in november 2008 as the newly elected president was devising a response to a global economic panic. Romer was instrumental in crafting the $ 862 billion economic stimulus package that obama signed shortly after being sworn into office. She co-wrote a paper that predicted the stimulus would prevent unemployment rates from rising above 8 percent, a stance that has come under attack by republicans who call the package a failure.
