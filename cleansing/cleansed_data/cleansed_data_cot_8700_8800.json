But for josh dickey, writing at mashable, you ' ll have to wrest his galaxy note 7 \" from my cold, possibly scorched hands \" in a judgment call that even mashable notes is \" obviously questionable. \" rebuking mashable's own deputy tech editor, who has called keeping the phone \" irresponsible \" and \" dangerous, \" dickey offers a major eyeroll, noting that the danger is likely overstated: he compares what he feels is hysteria over it to the same fear that \" gave us bloodletting … m. Night shyamalan's the village, actual tinfoil hats, and tens of millions of tweets about donald trump. \" instead he implores everyone to \" take a math break \" and figure out the chances of one's own galaxy phone bursting into flames. To wit: he notes that samsung has produced about 2.5 million original versions of the phone since it debuted in august, with fewer than 100 reported as having morphed into charred pieces of plastic and glass. He then compares the chance of experiencing such an explosion to those of other \" timeworn calamities \" such as lightning strikes and car accidents and stresses that all the phones that were going to explode probably already have. He then employs a mathematical formula that somehow involves the movie fight club, turning to the 1999 movie's script to come up with his final decision on the phone: \" i ' m keeping it. \" ( read his entire piece to see how ed norton's character helped him out. )",

        "summary": "The party started early on vj day. Though the official announcement that world war ii ended wasn't made until closer to 7pm on aug. 14, 1945, a scientific assessment of the famous photo of the couple kissing in celebration, called \" vj day in times square \" and widely known as \" the kiss, \" reveals the duo actually locked lips before then — at 5: 51pm eastern, to be precise. So reports a team of scientists that includes a physicist and astronomer in the august issue of sky &amp; telescope magazine. While they can't say with certainty who the couple is, they've used clues in the photo, such as shadows and light angles, as well as vintage maps and aerial photos, to determine the precise time photojournalist alfred eisenstaedt captured one of the century's most iconic images. Physicist donald olson says it took four years to sort out, a journey that started in 2010 when an astrophysicist friend and colleague pointed out — in response to a new york times article detailing new evidence about the image — that a peculiar shadow was draping part of the bond clock in the background, reports wired. This isn't the first such mystery olson has solved. He also figured out exactly when ( and where ) van gogh was when he painted \" moonrise \" in 1889, as well as claude monet when he painted his first impressionist work, \" impression, soleil levant, \" in 1872. Olson has even studied military mysteries and says that the uss indianapolis was likely so vulnerable to a japanese submarine in 1945 because it was backlit by a nearly full bright moon, reports the los angeles times.

Eman ahmed abd el aty, 37, was said to originally weigh some 1,100 pounds before undergoing bariatric surgery in india, reports the bbc, which cites local media reports that claimed she had dropped 660 pounds as a result ( her family disputed this in the midst of a dustup with the indian doctors who originally treated her ). A statement from the abu dhabi hospital where she has been receiving care since may described her cause of death as being from weight-related conditions including heart disease and kidney dysfunction, reports the times of india. Abd el aty's family said that prior to her leaving for treatment in mumbai in february, she hadn't left her home in 25 years, and that her extreme weight had forced her to crawl instead of walk by age 11. It wasn't an easy endeavor to transport abd el aty to india, a trip that cost around $ 125,000 and required the aforementioned cargo plane and a custom-modified truck, which she was lowered into by crane. Her uae doctors tell the national, \" her diet was right, and nothing could have been done differently — so we were all very surprised when she started to go downhill over the previous three to four days. \" al arabiya notes she turned 37 earlier this month and was permitted to eat ice cream as part of the celebration.

The mob reportedly broke down two prison gates and stripped down farid khan — a 35-year-old used-car dealer accused of raping a girl \" several times \" in february — before beating him and dragging him more than 4 miles to the local clock tower, where they planned to hang him. Khan reportedly died of his injuries before the group reached its destination, though his body was strung up anyway. Overwhelmed police unsuccessfully tried to gain control of the situation by firing into the crowd ( the times says they were shooting blanks ); at least 20 people were injured, and the crowd retaliated by throwing stones and setting police vehicles on fire. India has been on edge over a banned rape documentary in which filmmaker leslee udwin interviewed one of the men who gang-raped a young indian medical student in 2012. Mukesh singh's remorseless interview and outrageous comments about women have incited protests across india, the bbc reports. But the bbc also flags long-simmering tensions between locals and bengali speakers who are believed to be illegal immigrants from bangladesh: khan was suspected of being bangladeshi, and before he was killed, the mob had been protesting outside a city office about licenses issued to nonlocal shopkeepers, per the times. \" khan's death caused by a barbaric and bloodthirsty mob of over 10,000 was not a result of anger against a rapist: the trigger for such violence was obviously the rape, but within it lies [ an ] issue of territorial pride, \" simantik dowerah writes for firstpost.",

        "summary": "Ten thousand steps. It's easy to remember, and a goal lauded by several wearable fitness trackers, but is it actually a good daily target for fitness? the number is too simplistic and not for everyone, reports the huffington post. For instance, for the extremely sedentary, taking 10,000 steps — which works out to roughly five miles — every day is so lofty a goal it might actually work as a deterrent. And for people who are already active and, say, jogging a few times a week, 10,000 steps could amount to slowing down. Meanwhile, the number is probably too low for kids in general, one exercise researcher says. In a 2014 article, livescience pointed out the cdc doesn't actually specify a step count, but recommends 2.5 hours of moderate activity each week; that translates into roughly 7,000 to 8,000 steps. So where does the number come from? it appears to have originated in japan in the lead-up to the 1964 olympics in tokyo, with one company developing a pedometer called a man-po-kei, where \" man \" means 10,000, \" po \" means step, and \" kei \" means gauge. \" it was a business slogan, like ' just do it ' for nike, but it resonated with people, \" professor catrine tudor-locke tells the bbc. And while there's certainly no downside to shooting for the 10,000-mark, it won't necessarily make you thin. Us news &amp; world report last year flagged a 2008 meta-analysis of nine studies in which overweight or obese participants upped their steps by an average of 4,000 each day. After logging those extra miles for an average of four months, participants lost an average 3.13 pounds, \" an amount that was just barely deemed statistically significant, \" us news observed.

The annual awards ceremony for \" improbable research \" was held last night, the bbc reports, and a cornell university researcher whose study involved hundreds of stings was among the winners. Michael smith, who determined that the shaft of the penis, the nostril, and the upper lip are the worst places to be stung, shared the award with entomologist justin schmidt, who has been stung by scores of species and says the bullet ant delivers \" pure, intense, brilliant pain, like fire-walking over flaming charcoal with a three-inch rusty nail grinding into your heel, \" the guardian reports. Among the other ig nobel winners: austrian researchers determined that moroccan emperor moulay ismael could indeed have sired 888 kids if he had sex every day during his 30-year reign. He had a harem of 500 women, but the researchers determined he would have only needed 65, the ap reports. A trio of dutch researchers determined that \" huh? \" is used in almost every human language. Chilean and us researchers attached sticks to chickens and found the fake tails made them walk like dinosaurs, according to ig nobel-winning paper \" walking like dinosaurs: chickens with artificial tails provide clues about non-avian theropod locomotion. \" the management award was won by researchers who found that business leaders who witnessed natural disasters like earthquakes or floods when they were children were more likely to take risks — but only if they were not at significant risk of harm during the incident. All mammals over 6 pounds or so — from sheep to people to humans — empty their bladders in around 21 seconds, according to the ig nobel-winning \" universal urination theory. \" the lead researcher tells the bbc that the finding means smaller rodents like rats, which pee in under a second, are probably a poor choice for medical research into urination. Un-boiling an egg may sound like one of the silliest projects of the lot, but the \" vortex fluid machine \" used by the winning american and australian researchers has the potential to transform everything from cancer treatments to cheese-making, the guardian notes.

According to philip snider, the journey proved too much for his wife, and she died in a hotel parking lot. But there's no body, and a twisting story. Western tennessee benton county sheriff kenny christopher says philip snider has told two stories of flagged-down ambulances being involved: in one case, he allegedly said emts verified she was dead and drove off; in another they took her body, though he didn't know where. Now, a new version: he reportedly said she died on the way to memphis, that he kept her body in the back of his truck, stayed at a days inn near graceland — police have verified only he checked in — and dumped the 70-year-old's body into the tennessee river from an i-40 bridge on jan. 6. \" he stated to ohio police that he placed her body in two large black plastic bags because she had wanted to be cremated when she passed away, \" christopher said. \" he thought it would be better that he put her in the bags and return her to earth by putting her in the river, \" and said he \" couldn't stand the thought of her being burned, \" per the akron beacon journal. Though snider, 72, reportedly told ohio police that he heard the sound of her body hitting the water, christopher says a search of the area on jan. 9 turned up no body. A second search is planned for this week. Usa today reports no charges have been filed against snider, and hartville and benton county authorities are coordinating on the case. Fox8 reports roberta snider was last seen alive jan. 1 in their ohio home; police were alerted by her brother on jan. 9.",

He wants gun-control amendments addressing both issues added to a spending bill currently being debated by the senate. Politico reports compromise between the parties on either issue is unlikely. Donald trump is meeting wednesday with the nra on the first issue, cnn reports, but republicans want a judge to decide if people mistakenly added to a terror watch list can buy guns, while democrats want that power to lie with the justice department.

All claim they either got to work late or didn't make it there at all between sept. 9 and 12. \" this was just a reprehensible, outrageous situation caused by political motivation, \" says their lawyer, noting that one of her clients had a panic attack amid the gridlock. The controversy will have many days in court ahead, with new jersey democrats vowing to subpoena everybody mentioned in emails about the lane closures on the george washington bridge. The us attorney for new jersey has opened a preliminary inquiry, though some legal experts doubt the scandal could result in criminal charges, the new york times finds. The new york daily news has more on bridget anne kelly, the top christie aide fired for ordering the lane closures. The top adviser, a 41-year-old mother of four, was known for her low-key style, and the abrupt end to her once-promising political career has stunned many. \" the administration doing this doesn't surprise me. Bridget kelly — that does surprise me, \" says the director of the new jersey sierra club. Christie appointee david wildstein of the port authority, who stayed silent when questioned by state lawmakers yesterday, relished his role in the scandal and actually drove over to have a first-hand look at the traffic chaos, sources tell the daily news. \" wildstein is a sociopath, \" one source says. More details could come out today, with 907 pages of documents related to the case set to be released by the state assembly, cnn reports. As nbc news points out, there are still quite a few unanswered questions about the incident, and the documents could shed light on those. One of those questions: what started this? though the supposed reason is that the fort lee mayor refused to endorse christie for governor, many are suspicious of that considering christie didn't ask for or need his endorsement — and no other mayor who refused to endorse christie was \" punished, \" the wire notes. Rachel maddow's theory, offered up last night, is that the whole thing was actually sparked by a feud between christie and democrats in the state senate having to do with new jersey supreme court justice appointments. It started in 2010; details here. Jon stewart, meanwhile, took aim the scandal for the second night running on the daily show, nj.com reports. The new jersey native dubbed christie's apologetic",

Marlowe gets the credit in the upcoming new oxford shakespeare collection of shakespeare's works. For the first new edition of the collection in 30 years, an international team of scholars worked to identify co-authors of shakespeare works. The collection also includes works that shakespeare has been declared the co-author of for the first time, like thomas kyd's the spanish tragedy. Gary taylor of florida state university, one of the new edition's editors, tells the guardian that the1986 edition identified eight of 39 plays as collaborations, and the new edition lists co-authors for 17 of 44 plays. He says the team has \" strongly and clearly \" identified marlowe — who was stabbed to death in mysterious circumstances when he was just 29 years old — as co-author of the henry vi plays, despite his supposed rivalry with shakespeare. \" we can now be confident that they didn't just influence each other, but they worked with each other, \" taylor says. \" rivals sometimes collaborate. \" ( portrait cleaning could drastically change the appearance of the shakespeare we know. )",

        "summary": "High-ranking officials at the fbi and justice department were aware by late summer that investigators had found evidence of the extramarital affair that led to the resignation of gen. David petraeus, the new york times reports. But the law enforcement officials didn't let anybody outside the fbi and justice know about the general's affair with biographer paula broadwell until last week because the investigation wasn't complete, and there didn't appear to be any proof of security breaches, officials say. Lawmakers say they should have been informed much sooner and are demanding a probe into the investigation, but the fbi is defending its handling of the case, the washington post reports. Other tidbits that are trickling out on this monday morning: a source close to the petraeus family fleshes out the timeline a bit more: the affair began last year, about two months into petraeus ' run as cia director; it ended four months ago. Petraeus ' former spokesman tells reuters, \" my understanding is that they mutually determined that it was time to end it. \" the other woman to become a headline name in the brouhaha, jill kelley, said in a statement last night that she and her family has been friends with the petraeuses for more than five years. What was in the emails broadwell reportedly sent kelley? sources tell the new york post they included phrases like \" back off, \" \" stay away from my guy, \" and \" i know what you did. \" the timing of the revelation wasn't so hot for broadwell: the wall street journal reports that her 40th birthday bash, set for last saturday in dc, was canceled. Ouch: in addition to being valedictorian and homecoming queen, broadwell was voted \" most likely to be remembered \" by her high school class. Weird factoid: it turns out broadwell lives less than two miles away from john edwards ' mistress, rielle hunter, in charlotte's dilworth neighborhood, reports the daily beast. To clear up a question many have been asking: unlike in the military, adultery is not a crime in the cia. But because it could lead to blackmail, it can be a \" security issue. \"",

        "summary": "Ok, your baby isn't going to get the finer points of harry potter and the sorcerer's stone, but there are benefits to be reaped from exposure to books even in early infancy. New research presented at the 2017 pediatric academic societies meeting on monday shows that when babies as young as 6 months of age are read to, and especially when that reading is interactive — involving things like pointing and sound effects — their language and literacy skills are higher on their way into elementary school four years later. \" these findings are exciting, \" lead author carolyn cates says in a science daily news release, because the simple act of reading \" has a lasting effect. \" the researchers monitored 250 parent-baby pairs from ages 6 months to 4.5 years, and looked at both quantity ( number of books read, number of reading days per week ) and quality ( whether the parent discussed the book with the child, for instance ). Both quantity and quality predicted the child's vocab up to four years later; reading during the toddler years \" appeared strongly tied to later emergent literacy skills, such as name-writing at age 4, \" per the release. The study builds on previous research on reading and kids: popular science cites a 2014 study that linked how many books are in a house to reading level; 500 books on the shelves were tied to a 2.2-year advance in reading skills over one's grade level. So if you've been invited to a baby shower, maybe bring the baby a book. ( us adults rank middle-of-the-pack on literacy, but third to last on math. )",

Dod spokesman lt. Col. Jb brindle said in a statement that, to \" meet official mission requirements, \" it may be necessary to lock down a \" limited amount of space \" in the new york city building. President trump's wife, melania, and 10-year-old son, barron, still reside at trump tower, and abc news notes the president has suggested he ' ll spend weekends there. Trump has \" personnel and equipment \" he needs at the tower to support his presidential duties, per brindle, including the military staff responsible for keeping the \" nuclear football \" ( the bag with the instructions and codes to ok a nuclear strike ) close to trump, cnn notes. Brindle assures that the department would work through \" appropriate channels \" to make the lease legal. A worker for the company that rents commercial space in the tower tells cnn that floors available for rent run about $ 1.5 million a year. Similar space arrangements have been made for other presidents, including in chicago for former president obama, but the difference is that the trump organization, which owns trump tower, would be profiting from taxpayer dollars. \" i have never heard of a president charging rent to the dod or any other part of the government so they can be near him on his travels, \" richard painter, an ethics lawyer under george w. Bush, tells the chicago tribune, adding he thinks trump should offer a \" very limited amount of space \" free and let the dod rent other space in non-trump-owned properties.

        "summary": "A federal judge has ordered former trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos to report to prison as scheduled, rejecting his last-minute bid to delay his two-week sentence. Papadopoulos is to begin serving his sentence monday, the ap reports. He was sentenced in september for lying to the fbi in the russia investigation. He had sought a postponement of his prison term until an appeals court had ruled in a separate case challenging the constitutionality of special counsel robert mueller's appointment. But in a 13-page opinion sunday, us district court judge randolph moss said papadopoulos had waited too long to contest his sentence. He filed an initial motion on nov. 16, nearly two months after the deadline for appealing his conviction or sentence. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last year to lying to federal agents about his interactions with russian intermediaries during the 2016 presidential campaign. Moss noted that papadopoulos had agreed not to appeal in most circumstances as part of his plea agreement and the judge said the challenge to mueller's appointment was unlikely to be successful in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit. Four different federal judges have upheld mueller's appointment as proper. Responding to the judge's order, papadopoulos wrote in a tweet sunday that he looked forward to telling the full story behind his case. \" the truth will all be out, \" he said. \" not even a prison sentence can stop that momentum. \" ( a roger stone associate is in plea talks with mueller. )",

But while that first shocker drew cheers, this one is drawing fire. Here's what people are saying: in the book version, cersei lannister resists her brother jaime's advances at first, but soon shifts to egging him on in almost porn-worthy fashion: \" hurry, quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime jaime jaime. … yes, my brother, sweet brother, yes, like that, yes, i have you, you're home now. \" this is the second time the show has inserted a rape that wasn't in the books, making it \" hard to shake the idea that game of thrones, the show, doesn't see a problem with pushing a scene from complicated, consensual sex to outright rape, \" writes sonia saraiya at the a.v. Club. Since it's hard to see what statement is being made here, it looks like the show is \" falling into the same trap that so much television does — exploitation for shock value. And, in particular, the exploitation of women's bodies. \" \" i couldn't help wonder if it was yet another instance of rape-as-a-plot-device, \" writes hayley krischer at salon. The writers appear to be using the scene to sever the characters'relationship forever, but \" i can't help but wonder if there could have been another way jaime could crush cersei, emotionally and physically, without having to overpower her sexually with his massive kingsguard armor. \" it may just be a badly shot scene; the episode's director, alex graves, tells alan sepinwall at hitfix that the sex \" becomes consensual by the end, because anything for them ultimately results in a turn-on. \" nikolaj coster-waldau, who plays jaime, echoes that sentiment. \" i think that, for some people, it's just going to look like rape. The intention is that it's not just that, \" he tells the daily beast. \" it's about two people who've had this connection for so many years, and much of it is physical....

One person died and at least 18 others were injured after exhibiting symptoms of the rare illness, which is caused by a nerve toxin created by bacteria, per the cdc. A press release from fairfield medical center has confirmed the one death and says 10 people were moved to other hospitals, five remain in the er at fmc, and three are in icu there, per the ap; most of the affected are middle-aged, a hospital rep tells the dispatch. The hospital adds in its statement that it thinks all those sickened had attended a potluck picnic on sunday at cross pointe free will baptist church. The cdc notes about 15 % of botulism cases annually are foodborne ( the rest are typically related to wounds or found in infants ); the illness isn't contagious. Symptoms include blurry or double vision, slurred speech, and muscle weakness, and — as the hours tick by, and if left untreated — paralysis and even death. One of fmc's doctors tells cnn that though \" in this day and age botulism from food is fairly rare, generally it's canned foods \" that are to blame when it's caused by tainted fare. The cdc has sent an antitoxin to ohio, per the network. The church's pastor notes to food safety news that sunday's gathering wasn't different from others usually held. \" everyone is trying to find the common thread, \" he tells the site. \" my heart is crying. \"",

One blew up immediately upon launch and the other two flew about 150 miles before falling into the sea. Neither of those two landed in japan's territorial waters. While the launches appear to be less ambitious than other recent ones by pyongyang, they still raised tensions and demonstrated kim jong un's willingness to defy international demands that he cease all missile launches, notes the washington post. \"the north american aerospace defense command determined the three ballistic missile launches from north korea did not pose a threat to north america, \" said a spokesman, per the new york times. \"the us pacific command determined the three ballistic missile launches from north korea did not pose a threat to guam. \" the salvo came days after secretary of state rex tillerson praised the north for showing new \" restraint, \" raising hopes for dialogue.",

            "Seoul, south korea — north korea launched several short-range missiles off its coast on saturday, damping hopes in washington and south korea that the country would restrain from provocations to help pave the way for dialogue. The missiles blasted off from a coastal launching site and flew about 155 miles to the northeast before falling into the sea, the south korean military said in a statement. Military officials were analyzing data to determine what type of missiles were used, it said. The launchings occurred in a period of escalating tensions between the government of kim jong-un and the trump administration. American and south korean forces began twice-yearly war games on monday aimed at preparing for a possible attack by the north. The games continue until the end of august. The united states pacific command detected and tracked three short-range ballistic missile launchings, according to a spokesman, cmdr. Dave benham.",

Yoshihide suga told reporters the missiles early on saturday did not fall into japan's territorial waters or the coastal 200-mile economic zone. Japan has previously deployed missile interceptors after north korea threatened to fire projectiles over japan toward the us territory of guam.

            "Seoul, south korea — north korea launched several short-range missiles off its coast on saturday, damping hopes in washington and south korea that the country would restrain from provocations to help pave the way for dialogue. The missiles blasted off from a coastal launching site and flew about 155 miles to the northeast before falling into the sea, the south korean military said in a statement. Military officials were analyzing data to determine what type of missiles were used, it said. The launchings occurred in a period of escalating tensions between the government of kim jong-un and the trump administration. American and south korean forces began twice-yearly war games on monday aimed at preparing for a possible attack by the north. The games continue until the end of august. The united states pacific command detected and tracked three short-range ballistic missile launchings, according to a spokesman, cmdr. Dave benham.",

Yoshihide suga told reporters the missiles early on saturday did not fall into japan's territorial waters or the coastal 200-mile economic zone. Japan has previously deployed missile interceptors after north korea threatened to fire projectiles over japan toward the us territory of guam.

The video isn't crystal clear, however, and the ap reports that peters has told team officials that he slipped while trying to get the player away from the bench. The teen fell to the ice, though he got up immediately. It could get worse for the 36-year-old peters: buffalo police are investigating. \" we are very disappointed in the series of events that unfolded during the ( 15-and-under ) buffalo junior sabres game on saturday, \" said buffalo junior sabres president kevyn adams in a statement. Peters, he added, will remain on suspension until the matter is resolved. During his radio show monday morning — it's called the instigators — peters said he could not discuss the altercation, but added that he didn't do a good job of communicating to his team that fighting in youth sports is \" unacceptable, \" per wkbw. In six nhl seasons, the winger had only 7 points but 650 penalty minutes — though he once told the buffalo news that while he disliked fighting, he viewed it as a \" necessary evil \" to keep his job.",

Ramsay, who notes he met hamed in a \" secret location in turkey, \" says hamed claims isis has been taken over by ex-soldiers from saddam hussein's baath party, the group is moving its base to iraq, and islamic rule has \" totally collapsed. \" when ramsay asked hamed if the files could bring isis to its knees, the deserter said, \" god willing. \" meanwhile, us army col.

Reporters began exploring some of those things at the time and filing public records requests to more fully explore her record. Here's some quick background on the emails and suggestions on what to look for. We're also going to be updating this post, highlighting interesting nuggets, if any, that people come across.

The new york times reports university of houston graduate student zachary turpin found a long-lost advice series titled manly health and training written by whitman under the pen name mose velsor for the new york atlas in 1858. Over 13 entries and 47,000 words, whitman lays out his recipe for \" a perfect body, a perfect blood. \" according to the guardian, this was needed because — as whitman puts it — \" america has mentality enough, but needs a far nobler physique. \" the column touches on everything from diet and footwear to cold baths and naked sunbathing. \" it's sort of an insane document, \" turpin tells the times. \" let the main part of the diet be meat, to the exclusion of all else, \" whitman wrote. He warned against butter, pepper, ketchup, lobster, cucumbers, potatoes, chicken salad, and more, npr reports. He was also a big fan of facial hair. \" the beard is a great sanitary protection to the throat — for purposes of health it should always be worn. \" for sport, he favored dance and bare-knuckle boxing, which will make the us \"a hardy, robust, and combative nation. \" but whitman, famous for his homoerotic poems, warns against spending time \" continually among women. \" he worries \" manly virility \" has been lost to the \" almost insane pursuit of women... For the mere repetition of the sensual pleasure. \" the walt whitman quarterly review has published all 13 entries of manly health and training. ( a lost whitman poem was found in 2014. )",

The act was a simple but impressionable one that resulted in more than 70,000 shares in two days: an 18-year-old shop worker walking a 96-year-old man home from the aldi market, hand in hand, not expecting a thing in return. \" i asked my manager if it was ok to walk him home and he said that was the right thing to do, so i did, \" college student christian trouesdale tells the bolton news. \" then when the gentleman came in a week later, he asked for me and asked if i would do it again and i was very happy to. \" trouesdale admits he's normally a bit shy and doesn't know what to make of all the attention. Facebook comments include, \" you see good people are still around, \" \" well done on your parents for raising a young man to show respect for his elders, \" and, \" outshines all the derogative press for young people. \" brady, who works across the street from aldi, says she was motivated to post the photo for precisely this reason: \" there are so many negative stories about young people, but the positive ones just aren't seen on a large scale. \" but this one is already appearing in the telegraph, the mirror, and manchester evening news.

Garcia came to the us from mexico illegally as an infant, according to reuters. He returned to mexico around age 9, then returned to the us for good at age 17, along with his father, who was then a permanent resident and has since become a naturalized citizen. Garcia's own petition for citizenship has been pending since 1995; he's on track to get his green card in 2019.",

According to haaretz, the rebels were able to turn the bodyguard to syria's national security chairman, and that bodyguard was able to poison a meal served to president bashar al-assad's brother-in-law, the defense minister, interior minister, national secretary to the baath party, an aide to the vice president, and the security chairman. According to rumors, some of them died, but haaretz reports that emergency medical treatment actually managed to save everyone's life. Syria, however, insists no such attempt took place, and somewhat oddly aired its denial on the facebook page of a foreign ministry official ( two mobile phone companies also sent out text-message denials ), reports the new york times. Most of those denials only served to convince many syrians that something had actually happened. And if that's the case, it indicates the rebels are making strides, notes haaretz.

        "summary": "The nra made a surprise announcement thursday that it supported government restrictions on \" bump stocks, \" the devices that effectively turned stephen paddock's semiautomatic rifles into more lethal automatic weapons. The group called on the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives to review its rules on the accessories and determine whether they comply with current law. Coverage on friday, however, suggests what sounds like a major concession may not be so major: full text: the nra statement is here. Big distinction: the nra notably didn't ask congress to ban bump stocks, it asked the atf to review policy, notes the new york times. A common reaction is from democratic sen. Richard blumenthal, who called the nra move a \" highly dangerous and deceptive dodge. \" for one thing, he says, it could take years for any new regulations to take effect, as opposed to quicker law that could come through congress. Savvy move: at cnn, chris cillizza writes that it was smart politically for the nra to try to take this out of the hands of congress, where any outcome is uncertain. \" make no mistake, \" he writes. \" this move on bump stocks is an attempt by the nra to stop a broad public debate on guns before it really begins in earnest. And it almost certainly will work. \" ' admirable ': at the national review, robert verbruggen calls the nra statement \" admirable \" and says it was likely difficult to write. He thinks congress will eventually have to weigh in, and his suggestion is to allow current bump stocks to be grandfathered in, but forbid sales of new ones. No big change: jim newell at slate notes that the nra urged congress in the same statement to pass legislation allowing more americans to carry concealed firearms. The bump stock move is notable but ultimately small beans, he writes. \" the nra's position is to punt a flashy object into an opaque agency process that it can manage, while at the same time instructing congress to pass legislation allowing people to carry guns wherever they want. \" symbolic: philip elliott at time also views the nra move as largely \" inconsequential, \" though he also sees symbolic value. \" at this moment, voters are looking for anything, really, that might suggest they aren't as vulnerable as the blood-soaked vegas strip proved. The nra decided to let them have that one win. \" inventor: the man who came up with the bump stock is jeremiah cottle, an air force veteran, and he told the albany news back in 2011 that the inspiration came to him",

Adams, who had movement in his extremities and flashed a thumbs-up as he left on a stretcher, took a helmet-to-helmet hit from chicago's danny trevathan after catching a short pass. ( you can see the hit here, or here in slow motion. ) trevathan got penalized for unnecessary roughness on the play, though the league is expected to dole out a tougher penalty, perhaps a suspension, this week. \" it wasn't intentional, \" trevathan said after the game, per the chicago tribune. He added that he would try to reach out to adams to make that clear. \" i was just trying to hustle to the ball and do my job. \" at espn, kevin seifert writes that the hit was especially brutal because adams was already being taken down by other bears when trevathan delivered it. The league put in a new rule during the offseason making \" catastrophic \" hits punishable by suspension, and seifert thinks this one easily applies, calling it \" an exceptionally dirty [ hit ], considering adams was no longer making forward progress. \" mark maske of the washington post agrees, and is surprised trevathan didn't get immediately ejected. As for the anthem, players, coaches, and staff from both teams stood and locked arms as it was performed. Home team green bay had asked fans to do the same, though the ap reports it didn't appear that many did.",

According to a new survey of 27,564 americans called the national financial capability study that was put out by the finra foundation, roughly two-thirds of americans aren't able to correctly answer four out of five basic questions about finances. ( you can take the test here. ) the kinds of things most americans don't know? that 20 % interest on a $ 1,000 loan compounded annually results in $ 200 in interest at the end of the year. And the one that tripped up nearly three in four americans surveyed? as interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Even worse, as fortune reports, the percentage of people who are able to pass the test by answering four or five out of the five questions correctly has fallen since the financial crisis, from 42 % in 2009 to 37 % in 2015 — even though the crisis was largely characterized as a warning to better understand basic finances. The good news is that americans as a whole are feeling less strain financially, with 46 % of people having emergency funds in 2015 compared to 35 % in 2009. But a huge number of people, including african-americans, hispanics, women, millennials, and people without a high school education, are actually worse off than before the recession. And racial discrepancies persist: a whopping 39 % of blacks have resorted to high-cost borrowing from, say, pawn shops, compared to 21 % of whites and asians.

But those fake stories and others like them spread more widely on facebook than actual news stories before the election, a new buzzfeed analysis reveals. Specifically, the top 20 fake election stories racked up 8.7 million shares, reactions, and comments in the final three months of the election versus 7.4 million for stories from the likes of the new york times and the washington post. The trend accelerated as election day drew near, and all but three of the 20 top performers were pro-trump or anti-clinton stories. \" i ' m troubled that facebook is doing so little to combat fake news, \" dartmouth political science professor brendan nyhan tells buzzfeed. That may be changing. While mark zuckerberg initially dismissed the idea that fake news might have played a role in election results, he subsequently acknowledged that facebook could do more about the problem. Since then, both facebook and google have moved to restrict such stories via ads, including google barring fake websites from using its adsense advertising program, reports reuters. The washington post, meanwhile, interviews paul horner, one of the leading purveyors of fake stories, who says that \" people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything. \" and he adds this line sure to upset clinton supporters: \" i think trump is in the white house because of me. \"",

        "summary": "Even america's soda-makers agree that people are getting too many calories from their products, and the biggest three have now pledged to cut calorie consumption by a fifth by 2025. Coca-cola, pepsico, and dr pepper snapple group won't actually be reducing the number of calories their products contain, usa today reports, but they plan to step up the marketing of low-calorie drinks and bottled water, introduce calorie counts on soda vending machines and store coolers, and promote smaller portion sizes. An independent third party will keep tabs on the soda giants ' progress, though they won't be penalized if they fail to meet their targets, reports the wall street journal. The plan announced at the clinton global initiative yesterday \" is huge, \" bill clinton tells the new york times. \" i've heard it could mean a couple of pounds of weight lost each year in some cases. \" soft drinks account for around 6 % of the average consumer's daily calories, but clinton says it can be half or more among children in poorer communities. Health advocates, however, are pretty skeptical of the calorie-cutting initiative, noting that soft drink sales have been sliding for years anyway, and the companies have fought hard against efforts to fight obesity by taxing soda or restricting portion sizes. ( a recent study recommended a 12,000-step plan for people who drink a lot of sugary soda. )",

That's per mashable, which offers a condensed breakdown of the daily beast's deeper dive into a startling claim about guccifer 2.0: that the supposed \" lone \" hacker who said he pillaged democratic national committee emails and passed them along to wikileaks was really a military intelligence officer with the russian gru agency. The site says robert mueller has now stepped in to the guccifer probe and recruited the fbi agents who worked on that case onto his own team. The us government hasn't yet confirmed the daily beast claim, but the site says it's a link that, if true, \" would cross the kremlin threshold — and move the [ mueller ] investigation closer to trump himself. \" a researcher at cybersecurity firm threatconnect who worked to help unmask guccifer tells the daily beast it was tough going to track the hacker; all paths led back to a french data center. But it was soon discovered guccifer used a virtual private networking ( vpn ) service with russian headquarters to keep himself anonymous. And one day, apparently, guccifer forgot to sign in using the vpn, leaving his russia-based internet fingerprint on the server logs of \" an american social media company, \" per a source ( the daily beast notes guccifer often used twitter and wordpress ). Us investigators traced the ip address back to grizodubovoy street in moscow — the exact location of the gru agency. It appears the russian officer has also been ided, though sources didn't give the daily beast a name. One person who has admitted he was in contact with guccifer: trump surrogate roger stone.

Per a new survey by the japan family planning association, nearly half of all married couples here haven't had sex for over a month ( and didn't expect to be having any anytime soon ), which is the group's textbook definition of a \" sexless marriage, \" the guardian reports. The survey, which was part of a broader questionnaire for 3,000 people ages 16 to 49, received responses back from 655 married subjects, whose answers indicated that 47.2 % of them were in a marriage sans sex — a substantial difference from 31.9 % in 2004, and a record number. Newsweek lays out some of the possible reasons for the lackluster bedrooms in japan, including a workaholic culture ( more than 35 % of the men surveyed said they were too exhausted to engage in sexual interludes ) and even people opting instead for virtual partners. A psychologist who spoke to the guardian over a decade ago also said that many men \" think of their wives as substitute mothers, not as women with emotional and sexual needs. \" this lack of libido has been partly blamed for the country's low birth rate, which is making some nervous due to a decreasing population and workforce.

The fda says it's the first time it's ever asked a company to withdraw an opioid pain medication \" due to the public health consequences of abuse, \" according to nbc news. Endo international's opana er was first approved by the fda in 2006; a reformulated version of opana er, meant to lessen the potential for abuse, was released in 2012. But the fda, in an 18-8 vote, ruled the benefits of the reformulated version are outweighed by the risk of abuse, largely from crushing and injecting the drug. Endo argues its drug is both safe and effective. Endo states it's evaluating the fda's request. The company sold $ 158 million worth of opana er in 2015. The fda states that if endo doesn't voluntarily take opana er off the market, it will begin the process of withdrawing its approval of the drug. \"i really did not think that the fda would follow through, \" says a woman who lost her 21-year-old son to an opana overdose and later testified before the fda. In addition to being linked to the growing opioid crisis in the us, opana er was blamed for an outbreak of hiv and hepatitis c in 2015 in indiana, the ap reports. Approximately 2 million americans are addicted to prescription opioids. According to the cdc, opioid overdoses killed more than 40,000 americans in 2015 — a record high.",

        "summary": "Some 8 million people have chagas disease, a life-threatening illness passed to humans by \" kissing bugs, \" or triatomines, living in latin america. In the us, few people know about the disease — but the cdc figures that some 300,000 people may be infected here. In countries like bolivia, which has the highest rate of chagas in the world, it's standard practice to screen expectant mothers for the disease, since they could pass it on to their children. But in the us, doctors rarely think to check for the illness, which can cause heart or colon problems years down the line that, left untreated, can kill. But awareness is growing, especially in places like virginia, which one doctor suggests could be \" ground zero \" for the illness in the us, the atlantic reports. The state has more bolivians than any other, and dozens of cases have cropped up in the region. Infants and new cases can potentially be cured, but people with chronic cases may face eventual heart failure or brain inflammation. Yet \" most people can go years without having symptoms, \" an expert tells wtop. About 11,000 people per year die of the disease, but its association with immigration and poverty may be preventing widespread awareness, activists say. ( the disease, which may have contributed to charles darwin's death, has been called the \" new aids of the americas \" and costs the us economy $ 900 million a year. )",

By \" close call, \" it means an instance in which a drone \" came within a few seconds or a few feet of crashing into much larger aircraft. \" most of the incidents took place near new york city or washington while planes were either landing or taking off. Just one example: air traffic controllers say republic airlines flight 6230 was \"almost hit \" by a small drone at 4,000 feet as it was descending toward laguardia. The newly released figures show that sightings by pilots at airports are close to an everyday occurrence now: the faa says it gets about 25 reports a month from pilots of drones in restricted air space. The numbers are rising quickly as small, camera-equipped drones surge in popularity among hobbyists.

Their union claims kaiser has \" refused to address [ their ] concerns … about ebola safety protocols and protective equipment, refusing even to answer questions by the rns. \" the walkout will affect 21 of kaiser's hospitals and 65 clinics in northern california, reports bloomberg. Another 800 nurses at two non-kaiser hospitals in california and 400 at one in washington are planning strikes, and national nurses united will hold a \" day of actions \" in 16 states wednesday. Nnu says 85 % of nurses feel unprepared for ebola, their fears rooted in how ebola patient thomas duncan was cared for in texas last month, reports medical daily. The union, whose contract expired in april, says negotiations have stalled over one issue — patient care — and ebola is part of that. But kaiser insists that staff have been trained and they are following cdc recommendations, blaming union leadership for its lack of preparedness, bloomberg adds. \" we have repeatedly asked [ them ] to work with us on our ebola strategy. They have refused, \" says a kaiser spokesman. Meanwhile, kaiser plans to run its hospitals without the 18,000 rns — the er, pharmacy, and labs will be open, but some appointments may be canceled, the san francisco chronicle adds.
