        "summary": "The maya civilization suffered \" waves \" of war and political instability before its collapse in the 2nd century. The civilization later recovered, but history would repeat itself just a few hundred years later, delivering a final blow, researchers explain in a pnas study offering a clear chronology of the civilization's demise. It's based on 154 radiocarbon dates from charcoal samples along with data from ceramics at the site of ceibal in guatemala which show \" similar patterns \" of warfare around 75 bc and ad 735, reports the international business times. Each was followed by a period of political upheaval, the first of which led into the preclassic collapse of ad 150-300. Ceibal then saw a population decline and many other maya cities were abandoned. But with \" the development of dynasties centered on divine rulership, \" the civilization soon after rallied as power centralized, say researchers at the university of arizona. However, warfare returned a few centuries later, resulting in a new period of political instability. This one led into the classic collapse circa ad 800-950, when ceibal again experienced a population decline, according to a release. But this time, power splintered and the maya were unable to recover. Archaeologists now hope to survey other maya sites for similar patterns of decline that may show why the classic collapse proved fatal. ( this maya pyramid hides two others. )",

Using radiocarbon dating, they have come up with one of the most precise chronologies to date of the events that led to the civilisation's demise. The collapse of the maya civilisation during the classic era, around the 9th century, has been well studied, in part thanks to rich hieroglyphic records. Cities were abandoned and the sophisticated culture fell into oblivion as a result of increased warfare and gradual political decline. In contrast, even though there is evidence that another collapse occurred more than six centuries before, very little is known about it.

            "Significance tracing political change through refined chronologies is a critical step for the study of social dynamics. Whereas coarse chronologies can give an impression of gradual change, better temporal control may reveal multiple episodes of rapid disruption comprised in that span. Precise dating through radiocarbon determinations and ceramic studies is particularly important for the study of the preclassic collapse, which lacks calendrical dates recorded in texts. The high-precision chronology of ceibal revealed waves of decline over the course of the preclassic and classic collapses in a temporal resolution that was not possible before. The emerging understanding of similarities and differences in the two cases of collapse provides an important basis for evaluating the vulnerability and resilience of maya political systems.

Her first cookbook, published in may, reflected that lifestyle: tales from a forager's kitchen included recipes readers could make by foraging wild mushrooms, berries, and other plants from the forest. But the book has now been recalled due to concerns that those recipes could make aspiring foragers sick, buzzfeed reports. One recipe, for example, called for morel mushrooms to be eaten raw; doing so can lead to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, per health officials. Readers and experts alike expressed concern, including in reviews on the book's amazon page; multiple reviewers also pointed out recipes calling for raw elderberries ( they need to be cooked in order not to be toxic to humans ) and unleached acorns ( they're basically inedible by humans if not leached first ). Holmgren initially told buzzfeed her recipes were meant for \" adventurous eaters \" and noted that readers should \" be certain you are 100 % sure of the species and their identification before consumption.... If you aren't 1 million percent sure, do not eat it. \" but now publisher rodale books has formally recalled the book, issuing a statement saying that it takes readers ' concerns seriously and that, along with holmgren, it has \" decided to discontinue the publication and promotion of the book.

One primer in wide circulation today comes from the council on foreign relations. While russia captured the chechen capital in 2000 and theoretically reasserted control over the republic, sporadic violence from various insurgent groups has continued since, it states. One chechen militant, doku umarov, claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on moscow's subway in 2010. What's more, \" experts say there are several ties between the al-qaeda network and chechen groups, \" says the cfr primer. And all of this tells us what exactly? \" not very much, \" writes hayes brown at thinkprogress. \" an ethnicity does not indicate any sort of defined motive or ties to any possible group or groups, \" and \" it is difficult to discern what — if any — ties or sympathies the two brothers have to chechen terrorist groups. \" further, brown points out that chechen groups have historically set their sights on russia, not the us. ( the brothers ' alleged social media accounts suggest they were interested in chechen issues — and the elder reportedly posted a video from an extremist linked to al-qaeda, according to mother jones. ) quartz zeroes in on a statement chechnya president ramzan kadyrov posted today via instagram. Quartz translates it from russian; the key statement: \" any attempts to link chechnya and the tsarnaevs, if indeed they are guilty, are futile. They grew up in the usa, their viewpoints and beliefs were formed there. You must look for the roots of [ their ] evil in america. \" ( quartz, however, notes there's some disagreement about the last sentence; more on that here. ) in addition to the cfr piece, reuters previously published a backgrounder on insurgents in the caucasus region, and politico notes that president obama has avoided the issue of chechnya in deference to russia, much like his predecessors.",

The study looks at 294 cases between 2005 and 2015 in washington state. The patients were 90 % male and the average age was 24. Researchers found 39 % of injuries in those cases were related to shell-and-mortar-style fireworks. Adults accounted for most ( 86 % ) of all shell-and-mortar injuries, while teens were most likely to be hurt by homemade fireworks and children were most likely to be injured by rockets. \"my hands felt warm, \" mike spencer says. \"i looked at them and just saw red. \" spencer was one of the patients in the study. He lost four fingers after holding a mortar over his head in 2015. Hand injuries — along with brain and face injuries — were most common in incidents involving shell-and-mortar-style fireworks. More than a third of people who suffered a hand injury from a firework had to have at least a partial amputation. And researchers say shell-and-mortar-style fireworks can cause even more serious injuries than illegal fireworks, kiro reports. \"just because something is legal doesn't mean it's safe, \" dr.

Through a series of studies, they found that people with low self-esteem see the world in a much better light if they receive a simple physical touch, reports red orbit. In one experiment, a test-giver who handed out questionnaires about self-esteem and death gave some participants a gentle pat on the shoulder and others nothing. Those with low self-esteem who got the pat reported feeling less angsty about death, reports the research digest blog. \"our findings show that even touching an inanimate object — such as a teddy bear — can soothe existential fears, \" says the lead researcher in psychological science. \" interpersonal touch is such a powerful mechanism that even objects that simulate touch by another person may help to instill in people a sense of existential significance. \" to amplify that teddy bear point, they conducted another experiment in which people were asked to estimate the value of a teddy bear from afar. Those with low self-esteem who were reminded of death pegged it at $ 31, compared with $ 17 for those with high self-esteem or those not reminded of death. The first group was apparently pining for a hug, suggest the researchers, who add that they're now looking into \" haptic jackets \" that simulate hugs electronically as a potential therapy for those with depression and anxiety, reports medical daily.

The giant african land snail is a massive mollusk now infesting miami-dade county and threatening other parts of florida. They ooze in large bushes, gnaw through the stucco and plaster of residential homes and consume at least 500 different plants. The rare breeds of the species even carry a parasitic nematode that can lead to meningitis in humans — although no cases of disease transmission have been documented yet. Since september 2011, more than 116,000 of the snails have been found in 20 areas speckled throughout the county. They come from east africa and have been spread throughout the world from the pet trade, both as a food resource and through accidental introduction. They're considered one of the most dangerous and damaging snails — and they're being openly targeted.

            "The largest stretch 8 inches. The oldest live nine years. The busiest lay up to 1,200 eggs. Everywhere they go, people stop to gape. The giant african land snail is a massive mollusk now infesting miami-dade county and threatening other parts of florida. They ooze in large bushes, gnaw through the stucco and plaster of residential homes and consume at least 500 different plants. The rare breeds of the species even carry a parasitic nematode that can lead to meningitis in humans — although no cases of disease transmission have been documented yet. Since september 2011, more than 116,000 of the snails have been found in 20 areas speckled throughout the county. They come from east africa and have been spread throughout the world from the pet trade, both as a food resource and through accidental introduction. They're considered one of the most dangerous and damaging snails — and they're being openly targeted. At the state and federal level, the department of agriculture and consumer services is on a mission to eradicate the snails before they spread through florida, said denise feiber, the public information director of the division of plant industry in gainesville. \"they're a trifecta, \" said feiber, who's traveled to miami several times to help dispose of the snails. \"they're a risk to property, health",

A giant african land snail is seen in this handout picture from the florida department of agriculture division of plant industry taken september 9, 2011. Orlando, florida south florida is fighting a growing infestation of one of the world's most destructive invasive species: the giant african land snail, which can grow as big as a rat and gnaw through stucco and plaster. More than 1,000 of the mollusks are being caught each week in miami-dade and 117,000 in total since the first snail was spotted by a homeowner in september 2011, said denise feiber, a spokeswoman for the florida department of agriculture and consumer services. Residents will soon likely begin encountering them more often, crunching them underfoot as the snails emerge from underground hibernation at the start of the state's rainy season in just seven weeks, feiber said.

        "summary": "A 46-year-old florida woman became a new mom to a healthy baby boy last year via ivf — and though it's not unheard of for a woman to deliver a baby at her age, what's medically remarkable is that belinda slaughter didn't use frozen or donated embryos, but her own 46-year-old egg. And she's the oldest american woman verified to do so, nbc news reports. Son jackson was born in september, the orlando sentinel reports, but the case was just published in a medical journal this month. Slaughter — who had fertility issues — was told she had a 1 % chance of conceiving, but one of the four fresh, fertilized eggs implanted in her uterus latched on. \" i didn't think this was so special, \" slaughter, now 47, tells the sentinel. \" i thought,'there are women older than i am having babies. ' \" she's right. Nbc lists one past success a few years ago — an unverified 46-year-old italian woman. The sentinel lists a couple more: a 59-year-old brit who conceived her child naturally without ivf, and another unverified case in 2011 of a 49-year-old woman who gave birth after using her year-old frozen eggs. But doctors emphasize just how rare a feat this was. Fertility expert dr. Richard paulson remarks that \"in the world of reproduction, nothing gets better with age. \" indeed, slaughter's pregnancy was rife with complications, and she delivered at 31.5 weeks. \" in no way does a woman want to use this example to defer fertility until they are older, \" her doctor says.",

One man died instantly, reports the ap; the other died as medics worked on him. Dutch firm smit salvage is overseeing the recovery of the 610-foot ferry; one line was attached early today and sailors were working to attach a heavier-duty towline. The ap notes that it's not clear if the sailors were killed in that process. Also unclear: where the norman atlantic will be towed once it's secured. Meanwhile, discrepancies in the ship's manifest mean authorities don't know exactly how many people were aboard — or how many might still be missing. Searches are continuing. And there's more trouble in the region's waters: a cargo ship believed to be carrying some 600 immigrants issued a distress call today, reports the ap, and greece is diverting a frigate from the norman atlantic and sending a helicopter in response. The call came from a passenger aboard the moldovan-flagged blue sky m, officials say; the vessel was sailing in bad weather northwest of the island of corfu.",

        "summary": "A major flaw in one of the internet's chief security methods has exposed users ' confidential information to hackers for the last two years, security researchers revealed monday night. The \" heartbleed \" bug affects the openssl security protocol used by some two-thirds of websites to protect sensitive data as it moves back and forth. Major websites are scrambling to fix the problem ( yahoo did so yesterday ), reports the bbc, but experts suggest users change their passwords as soon as they are sure the sites they use are secure — or even avoid the internet for a few days. \" i would change every password everywhere, \" one tells the ap. The bug ( which a cryptographer describes as the \" result of a relatively mundane coding error \" ) allows hackers to pull 64k of memory, at random, from a server — and since the attacks leave no trace, hackers can \" go fishing \" over and over again for sensitive data like passwords and bank details, the verge explains. It's not clear how widely the bug was exploited, but the security hole means the \" little lock icon ( https ) we all trusted to keep our passwords, personal emails, and credit cards safe was actually making all that private information accessible to anyone who knew about the exploit, \" the security team at tumblr wrote in a blog post. For now, users should make sure to log out when they finish using a website, the chief of content delivery network cloudflare tells the huffington post, adding that the bug \" is so serious — it's such a big, bad event — that almost every major service is scrambling to clean it up as quickly as possible \" and most major sites should be patched by the end of the week.

        "summary": "More than 1 in 4 cases of possible sexual and physical abuse against nursing home patients apparently went unreported to police, says a government audit that faults medicare for failing to enforce a federal law requiring immediate notification. The health and human services inspector general's office issued an \" early alert \" monday on preliminary findings from a large sampling of cases in 33 states, reports the ap. Auditors — who scoured hospital, nursing home, and billing records — identified 134 cases spanning 2015 to 2016 in which emergency room records indicated possible sexual or physical abuse, or neglect. In 28 % of the cases, investigators could find no evidence in hospital records that the incident was reported to local law enforcement. That's despite a five-year-old federal law requiring nursing homes to report such incidents to police and other agencies, or risk fines of up to $ 300,000. In one case involving an alleged sexual assault reported to police by a patient's family, a nursing home actually \" contacted local law enforcement in an attempt to keep law enforcement from investigating the incident, \" the inspector general's report said. A nursing home industry trade group says its members know they must immediately report alleged abuse. The american health care association adds it will work with the government to ensure safety. In a statement, medicare emphasized that nursing home safety is a high priority, but it said it will await a complete report before announcing a response.",

The health and human services inspector general's office issued an \" early alert \" monday on preliminary findings from a large sampling of cases in 33 states.

Police say the three women have now been released from the hospital — where berry was photographed joyfully reuniting with her sister — and gone home with family. A 6-year-old child was also rescued, but police did not reveal the child's identity or relationship to anyone in the home; radar describes her as berry's daughter. Three brothers, ages 50, 52, and 54, have been arrested, though only the middle brother, identified by neighbors as former school bus driver ariel castro, is believed to have lived at the home where the women were held captive. Authorities, who plan to hold a press conference on the case this morning, say the women were probably tied up during their years of captivity, the ap reports. A woman whose relatives live on the street tells the plain dealer that castro typically parked his car behind the house, and would lock a gate before entering — through the back door. She described the home as always dark, with at least one window covered with boards. Click for more on how the women were able to escape.",

        "summary": "In 1977, a radio telescope recorded a 72-second signal coming from the direction of the constellation sagittarius. Stunned, the astronomer who observed it wrote \" wow! \" on the readout. Since it couldn't be explained, plenty argued the signal was proof of life beyond our planet. After 40 years, however, a researcher has finally burst their bubble. Antonio paris of st. Petersburg college last year suggested the 1420 mhz \" wow! \" signal actually came from hydrogen gas surrounding a comet — either 266p/christensen or p/2008 y2, which were in the area of the signal at the time but only discovered about 10 years ago, per popular mechanics. So when one passed by earth earlier this year, paris pointed a radio telescope at it. Unlike any other celestial source nearby, 266p/christensen emitted a radio signal at 1420.25 mhz. Paris then pointed his telescope at three other comets selected at random. All appeared to emit a 1420 mhz signal, which hydrogen atoms naturally produce, per the seti institute. A seti researcher told forbes last month that the signal was likely radio frequency interference. But this shows that ' 77's ' wow!'signal \" was a natural phenomenon from a solar system body \" and certainly not a message from aliens, paris writes in the journal of the washington academy of sciences. Or, as the london times puts it, the wow signal just \" officially lost its wow factor. \" ( a coming telescope will be able to view nearby galaxies in \" unprecedented \" detail. )",

            "The question \"are we alone in the universe? \" has fascinated people for centuries. In 1959 two cornell university physicists described how we might answer that question through interstellar communication. Philip morrison and guiseppe cocconi analyzed how two civilizations separated by many light years of space might use electromagnetic radiation to communicate. Electromagnetic radiation is the general term for the more familiar light and radio waves, but also includes gamma rays, x rays, ultraviolet rays, and infrared. All of these forms of electromagnetic rays or waves travel at the speed of light, the fastest possible speed. The only difference between these types of electromagnetic waves is the length or the wave or the \"wavelength. \" since the waves all travel at the speed of light, another way to characterize the wave is by the number of waves received per second. This is the frequency of the wave. Morrison and cocconi considered how well the types of electromagnetic waves passed through interstellar space. While space is usually described as a vacuum, it does contain some gas and dust. Over great distances that gas and dust absorb many types of radiation but radio waves pass through nearly unimpeded. For interstellar communication, a particular range of radio frequencies, \"microwaves \" from 1 ghz to 10 ghz, are particularly good choices. At lower frequencies our galaxy emits prodigious amounts of radio waves",

        "summary": "Oh, the proverbial fountain of youth. As we age, can we somehow tap into it? researchers are exploring this in a literal way as they study the effects of blood from human umbilical cords — which is about as young as it gets — on aging mice. Reporting in the journal nature, they found that mice injected with human plasma from umbilical cords ( several times over the course of weeks ) in late middle age seemed to acquire better memories. The mice preformed better in maze tests, and memory-making genes in the brain fired back up. It's one of the first findings that young blood \" might be having an effect on the brain itself, \" one researcher tells npr. Still, while an outside researcher tells science magazine that these \" are exciting results, \" others note that there are several caveats that temper them. First, they have yet to be replicated in humans. And the protein that seems to be helpful, timp2, happens to be found in higher levels in people with alzheimer's. One leery researcher tells npr that aging isn't about running out of positive things but about accumulating negative things. Introducing new blood may only go so far in counteracting that accumulation, though more research may provide answers. ( some argue umbilical cords shouldn't be cut so fast. )",

She and others say the new finding suggests that this and other factors in young blood may have different, complementary effects on the aging brain. Decades ago in somewhat grisly experiments, researchers found that sewing together the circulatory systems of an old and young mouse so that they shared the same blood supply rejuvenated the old animals. In 2014, as part of renewed interest in this unusual procedure, known as parabiosis, neuroscientist tony wyss-coray's lab at stanford university in palo alto, california, reported that it could mimic some of the brain-boosting effects of parabiosis with injections of young mouse plasma, the cell-free part of blood.

That's what archivists at the national library of norway in mo i rana recently discovered during a digitization project, stumbling across two reels of a long-lost 1927 walt disney movie that was the company's first christmas film, the huffington post reports. Empty socks stars oswald, a precursor to mickey whose relation is obvious once you see the character is basically mickey with rabbit ears. The only other footage that's known to exist of this film is a 25-second scrap of footage housed at nyc's museum of modern art. The newly discovered reels had been kept all this time in a special room with controlled temps and humidity, afp reports. \" at the beginning, we didn't know it was a lost cinematographic treasure, \" an archivist says in a statement. In fact, library staff thought the five-minute, 30-second flick ( with one minute missing in the middle ) was a felix the cat oldie. But after weighing in with an animation historian, they realized they had one of the earliest movies with oswald, created by disney himself and partner ub iwerks. The library has the original — which was provided by the norwegian film institute and probably originated with a private collector — and sent a copy to the walt disney company. But why did oswald fall out of favor with disney? universal wrested rights to the character away during a contract dispute, forcing walt and ub to come up with someone else who stuck around a little longer: the most famous mouse in the world.

        "summary": "Apple today unveiled its latest take on the ipad concept: the ipad air. This new edition clocks in at just 7.5mm thick and weighs a single pound, the verge reports. It's got the same screen as the previous ipad — a 9.7-inch retina display — and the same 64-bit a7 processor and m7 motion coprocessor as the iphone 5s. The design has been subtly tweaked, with the side bezel reduced, but even that modest change represents the first tweak on the device's look since 2011. The air will be available on nov. 1, with prices starting at $ 499 for wi-fi-only versions and $ 629 for cellular ones. Rounding out the ipad line will be a new ipad mini featuring retina display and the a7 processor, starting at $ 399; the original ipad mini, now down to $ 299; and what the verge refers to as the \" geriatric \" ipad 2 for $ 399. Other news from the event: the macbook lines got an upgrade, effective immediately: the 13-inch model is slimming down to just.71 inches thick; it weighs less than 3 pounds and boasts both a longer battery life and an improved intel iris graphics chip, according to gizmodo and techcrunch. The 15-inch model is getting a boost in the processor and memory department as well, and both are having $ 200 shaved off their price tags, putting them at $ 1,300 and $ 2,000 respectively. Apple also announced that the new os x mavericks will be available for download for free later today. It doesn't represent a major visual overhaul the way ios 7 did, 9to5mac reports, but it does have more than 200 new features, including maps, ibooks, improved multiple display support, and more. For those not into portable computers, apple unveiled its new superpowered desktop computer, the mac pro. This small, black cylinder boasts eye-popping specs — like a 3.7ghz quad-core zeon processor, 12gb of dram, and dual firepro d300 graphics with 2gb vram each — for an equally eye-popping $ 2,999 price tag.",

The assad regime was moving desperately to clean up evidence of the recent shelling assault on the city ahead of her arrival; state-run tv showed bulldozers and soldiers cleaning the streets of baba amr, but the new york times describes a more \" violent mopping-up operation \" as well, with mass arrests and occasional executions. Amos says her goal is to \" urge all sides to allow unhindered access for humanitarian relief workers. \" the regime has barred the international committee of the red cross from entering baba amr, citing security concerns, but amos is being accompanied by the red crescent. Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports have syrian tanks moving on to idlib, which some fear could be the next homs. China has also announced that it is pulling its workers out of syria for their own safety.",

In october, wettlaufer was charged in the deaths of eight residents at nursing homes in woodstock and london. In january, she faced six additional charges related to seniors in her care. She worked at the facilities between 2007 and 2014. Family members of wettlaufer's victims were faced with a long and emotional day in court. Some broke down in the courtroom as wettlaufer entered her pleas. Superior court justice bruce thomas told the families, \" i can't imagine the betrayal \" and said their strength dealing with what they saw in court impressed him.

Trump didn't clarify, but he's likely referring to deputy attorney general rod rosentein, who appointed special counsel robert mueller, notes politico. Or he means mueller himself. Earlier, he tweeted that \" after 7 months of investigations &amp; committee hearings about my ' collusion with the russians, ' nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad! \" related: new order: members of trump's transition team were ordered thursday to keep \" any physical and electronic records \" related to the investigation into possible russian collusion, reports the new york times. The newspaper sees it as further evidence that mueller is \" casting a wide net \" in the inquiry's early stages. The order also wants background records on former campaign manager paul manafort; his business partner rick gates; former foreign policy adviser carter page; former national security adviser michael flynn; and longtime trump adviser roger stone.

        "summary": "A 55-year-old family mystery was finally solved this week just hours after the story appeared on canadian television, the cbc reports. In 1962, a woodsman searching for timber in the forest of lutes mountain in new brunswick, canada, found a large white box hanging from a tree by a parachute. Inside the box, david mcpherson sr. And his family found two cameras. A few days later, the canadian military took the box away, and despite promises from the government and two access-to-information requests to the department of defense over the next decades, the mcphersons never saw the box again. Then the cbc reported on the so – called \" thing in the woods \" on tuesday, and within hours tips began coming in from viewers, and soon the mystery was solved. Viewers pointed the cbc to the military communications and electronics museum in kingston, ont., and to declassified documents on the cia website, both of which had photographs of an an/dmq-1 gondola, part of american surveillance equipment used in the 1950s to conduct reconnaissance of soviet russia and communist china as part of an operation called project genetrix. The project was run alongside a \" front \" operation involving weather balloons, and the national reconnaissance office explains that of the 516 camera-carrying high-altitude balloons launched as part of the program, most weren't recovered by the us; \" useful intelligence \" was gleaned from just 34 of them. Though the discovery marks the end of a half-century of wondering for the mcpherson family, it came too late for the man who found the mystery box in the first place. David mcpherson sr. Died 18 months ago. ( read about another mystery that's been solved. )",

It wasn't until he was about halfway up the 455-foot structure that police finally spotted him. Ciesielski kept climbing and reached the top in about eight minutes. Spectacular images on his blog show the surrounding pyramids and ancient dwellings. The view \" was really, really amazing, \" he says. Ciesielski took his time with his descent for safety reasons and was back on the ground in about 20 minutes, he writes. He was then taken into police custody. \" at first, they wanted to take me to the german embassy, but after a while i was released without anything further happening, \" ciesielski says. Officers declined to press charges on the condition that they delete all photographic evidence of his climb. Unbeknownst to police, ciesielski had software that allowed him to recover the deleted images. \" some people were really angry, but i don't care, \" ciesielski says of his climb. \" i didn't destroy anything. I didn't hurt anyone. \" ( giza's pyramids may house secret passages. )",

The government said the civilians evacuated from muadhamiya, an opposition stronghold southwest of the capital, had been \"held hostage by the terrorists, \" referring to armed rebels. Those rescued were to be taken to temporary shelters \"equipped with all basic life needs, \" the official state news service said in a statement. But opposition activists said the residents left muadhamiya in a brokered deal allowing them to escape a relentless government bombardment that has killed many civilians. The district has been under military siege for several months. [ updated 1: 22 p.m. Pdt, oct. 14: on monday, the international committee of the red cross said that thousands of civilians remained in muadhamiya, including hundreds who are sick or wounded and require urgent care. The red cross urged syrian officials to permit the delivery of medical supplies to the suburb and all areas under siege outside damascus. \"all parties must ensure that the civilians remaining in muadhamiyah are protected, that the sick and the wounded receive proper medical treatment, and that those who wish to leave besieged areas can do so safely, \" said magne barth, who heads the icrc delegation in damascus.

The prize, which was given to the global chemical weapons watchdog on friday, \" should have been mine \", assad said, according to al-akhbar newspaper. Assad made the remark \" jokingly \", the daily said, as he commented on the award on friday of nobel peace prize to the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons, which is working in syria to destroy the assad regime's massive chemical arsenal by mid-2014. Al-akhbar also reported that assad had proposed in 2003 that all countries in the region should hand over all weapons of mass destruction. But the newspaper did not say when assad made the comments about the nobel. The opcw and the un have had a team of 60 experts and support staff in syria since october 1, while the civil war rages on. The team started its work after a breakthrough un security council resolution last month ordering syria's chemical stockpile destroyed. The resolution came after a chemical attack in damascus province on august 21 that killed hundreds of people. It also followed us threats to strike assad"

Gabrielle giffords caused few major changes, many think this latest tragedy will also do little to shake up the status quo. \" i think very little will happen because our political leaders are so afraid of the gun lobby, \" one advocate, whose son died in the columbine shooting, told the wall street journal.",

Now, researchers at howard hughes medical institute say a simple blood test can identify every virus you've ever had. From just a single drop of blood, virscan can detect the remains of more than 1,000 strains of 206 viruses that are infecting or have ever infected a patient, discover reports via a science study. The cost: about $ 25, reports redorbit. Essentially, the immune system creates new b cells designed to battle a particular virus; those cells make the antibodies that bind to and inactivate the virus, and identifiable traces of those antibodies remain in the blood — ready to fight the virus again should it return. Previously, doctors could only test for antibodies to one virus at a time. But virscan can search for hundreds of antibody reactions simultaneously, popular science reports. After screening blood from 569 people on four continents, experts found people were exposed to 10 viruses on average; two had antibodies for 84 different viruses. Study author tomasz kula makes clear one advantage of virscan: \" you can look at viral exposures in an unbiased way without having to suspect a particular infection ahead of time. \" that could help patients with undiagnosed diseases, including, for instance, hepatitis c. Kula points out hepatitis c can spur liver damage and cancer, often \" because patients do not show symptoms for many years and so they did not get tested for this particular virus. \" ( read how a college dropout revolutionized blood tests. )",

Using a synthetic representation of all human viral peptides, xu et al. Developed a blood test that identifies antibodies against all known human viruses. They studied blood samples from nearly 600 people of differing ages and geographic locations and found that most had been exposed to about 10 viral species over their lifetime.

In addition to directly causing acute or chronic illness, viral infection can alter host immunity in more subtle ways, leaving an indelible footprint on the immune system. This interplay between virome and host immunity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of complex diseases such as type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma.

Inmates at the prison in monterrey, about 140 miles from the border with texas, include members of mexico's gulf cartel as well as the feared zetas cartel. The outburst in apodaca prison would be the second-largest \" mass homicide \" in the state of nuevo leon's history, after an attack on a casino left 52 dead in august, according to mexican magazine proceso ( link in spanish ). In may, 14 inmates were killed and burned in apodaca's psychiatric area, according to the magazine. Authorities said clashes erupted at around 2 a.m. Local time ( 3 a.m. Et ), after which a fire broke out. Unidentified sources told proceso that gunfire was also heard. However, domene told milenion magazine"

So the owner of a rolls-royce made in england can feel pretty special that his or her sedan is the subject of a rare single-car recall that affects that car alone, the financial times reports. The affected 2015 luxury sedan, which syracuse.com notes typically costs at least $ 300,000, has front-seat air bags that may not meet side-impact requirements ( which, as the telegraph notes, isn't ideal for a car that can reach a top speed of 155mph ). It's apparently the result of \" the incorrect labeling on one of the airbags, \" a rep tells the times. No worries for the owner of the car, which was manufactured on january 23, 2014 — the recall notes a rolls-royce dealer can hook the vehicle up with new air bags free of charge. ( maybe the owner can soup up the car with some of these insane options while it's in the shop. )",

Biological parents to eight children already, cori had spent years as a registered nurse and always loved caring for hospice patients as well as babies in maternity wards, she tells today. Then, after struggling with an autoimmune disorder that forced her to stop working, she realized it would be the perfect time to help what she calls \" hospice babies \" — the ones with grim prognoses whose parents have given up guardianship amid their grief and who spend their final days largely alone, often hooked to ventilators and feeding tubes. \" we invest deeply, and we ache terribly when these kids die, but our hearts are like stained-glass windows... Made of broken glass which has been forged back together, and... Stronger and more beautiful for having been broken. \" the salcherts first brought home baby emmalynn in august 2012. Their foster daughter was missing both the left and right hemispheres of her brain ( only her brain stem was intact ), and she lived 50 days. Cori says she was snuggling emmalynn into her fuzzy green robe \" like a kangaroo \" late one night, when she realized her daughter had died — to the sound of her own heartbeat. Next they had jayden, reports the sheboygan press, a baby who actually overcame his medical issues and, as a thriving toddler, was adopted by a cousin of his biological parents. A week later, after a family discussion that included one daughter saying, \" what if some kid really needs us and you're just sitting here with a broken heart? \" the salcherts brought home baby charlie, who experiences neurological impairments. \" he will die; there's no changing that, \" cori says of her adopted son. \" but, we can make a difference in how he lives, and the difference for charlie is that he will be loved before he dies. \" they call their home a \" house of hope. \" ( this is what it was like for this girl to be adopted at 17. )",

Ahead of wonder woman's release in theaters next month, the superhero film has entered into a promotional partnership with thinkthin, maker of diet products.

Add to that a thinkthin survey identifying invisibility as women's most desired superpower — mary sue argues it highlights a \" hard to ignore \" link between diet messages aimed at women and a desire to have their body disappear entirely — and wonder woman has become an example of the \" unrealistic standards \" women have to deal with: be strong like the amazonian warrior, but make sure you maintain the thin figure that society deems attractive.

That alleged weapon: a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide, which khaw kim-sun is accused of leaving in the trunk of a mini cooper his wife, wong siew-fung, was driving in may 2015, the south china morning post and bbc report. The ball is said to have deflated while in the car, leaking the gas that killed wong and 16-year-old khaw li-ling; the two were found unconscious in the locked car by a jogger. Prosecutor andrew bruce says khaw, a malaysian professor specializing in anesthesiology at chinese university, was having an affair with a student and that wong knew about it but refused to grant him a divorce. Per coconuts, bruce told a hong kong jury thursday that khaw's anesthetist background gave him knowledge of, and access to, the carbon monoxide, and that the student he was having the affair with helped him with the \" research project \" he'd set up as a ruse to get his hands on the carbon monoxide. Bruce adds that co-workers saw khaw filling two yoga balls with the gas, explaining that he wanted to see how it affected rabbits. He later changed that story and told cops he wanted the carbon monoxide to kill rats at his house, though a worker at his home said rats weren't an issue there. The one part of his alleged scheme that went awry, per bruce: although khaw meant to kill his wife, he hadn't expected his daughter to be in the car with her. \" the last thing the accused wanted was for his 16-year-old to die, \" bruce says, per the post.

        "summary": "The man found lying on his back on a patch of grass on the outskirts of manchester on dec. 12, 2015, dead of strychnine poisoning, has finally been identified thanks to an international police investigation. Police believe that the man, identified as 67-year-old david lytton, took his own life, reports the bbc. He'd arrived in the uk via a flight two days prior from lahore, pakistan, though he turns out to be english, and his ties to the area remain unknown. Having been found with no id on him, police initially revealed what they did know: the man had walked into a pub in greefield, saddleworth, in the late afternoon on the 11th, and asked for directions to the \" top of the mountain, \" referring to the nearby indian's head peak. He was only wearing light clothing and slip-on shoes. The guardian reports on a key clue: an autopsy found that that a serious injury to the man's left leg was repaired with a titanium plate exclusively used by a dozen hospitals in pakistan. Speculating that he could have entered the country from pakistan, police checked passenger records from dozens of flights from lahore in the days before his death. They came across a name; an old passport image suggested they were on the right track. A british relative was located and gave a dna sample, and it matched. Lytton had lived in pakistan for a decade, and was known as \" a bit of a loner \" who \" liked his own company. \" police are still investigating why lytton chose to visit saddleworth. Strychnine, used to kill rodents, is more readily available in pakistan. ( this 44-year-old's death in a posh london suburb remains shrouded in mystery. )",

Previously, bp had said the test was inconclusive, the wall street journal notes, but now the company says ignoring it may have been the \"fundamental mistake \" that led to the explosion. It certainly wasn't the only one, however. Workers ignored several other equipment readings as well, the new york times reports, and took the risky step of replacing the heavy mud in the pipe with seawater. The cement meant to seal the well in an emergency also appears to have been contaminated.

            "Oil giant bp plc told congressional investigators that a decision to continue work on an oil well in the gulf of mexico after a test warned that something was wrong may have been a \" fundamental mistake, \" according to a memo released by two lawmakers tuesday. The document describes a wide array of mistakes in the fateful final hours aboard the deepwater horizon — but the main revelation is that bp now says there was a clear warning sign of a \" very large abnormality \" in the well, but work proceeded anyway. The rig exploded about two hours later. The congressional memo outlines what the lawmakers say was a briefing for congressional staff by bp officials early tuesday. Company representatives provided a preliminary report on their internal investigation of the april 20 disaster, which killed 11 workers and continues to spill thousands of barrels of oil daily into the gulf of mexico. The new developments come as president barack obama, working to tame a political storm over the spill, is expected to announce thursday that the government will impose tougher safety requirements and more rigorous inspections on off-shore drilling operations. According to the memo, bp identified several other mistakes aboard the rig, including possible contamination of the cement meant to seal off the well from volatile natural gas and the apparent failure to monitor the well closely for signs that gas was leaking in,",

The testimony may help clear up some of the uncertainties about the day of the accident, including who was making the decisions. But the new information from bp — combined with past testimony by executives, analysis of documents by the new york times and interviews with independent drilling experts — is beginning to paint a picture of a complex operation that went awry just as it was drawing to a close. Photo drilling logs from the deepwater horizon suggest that shortly after midnight on the morning of the explosion, attention had turned to temporarily plugging and capping the well so the rig could disconnect and move to another job.

And for what? the new york times wasn't even impressed with the clothes: \" it's not that they were terrible. They weren't original or risky enough to be terrible. They were just boring. Not ambitious or eclectic or even surprising. Yawn. \"",

        "summary": "In the 1950s, when abortions were rarely sanctioned and only when a committee of doctors approved them, somewhere between 200,000 and 1.2 million illegal abortions were performed every year. One such case in particular grabbed grim headlines across the country: a young woman by the name of jacqueline smith — who wanted to keep her baby — was given a messy illegal abortion in her boyfriend's apartment on dec. 24, 1955. Sixty years later, there are still lessons to learn from her gruesome death, writes gillian frank on slate. The details captured the attention of many: a hospital attendant gave smith, who was positioned on a couch covered in blankets and newspaper, 50 times too much anesthesia via an iv drip made from a broomstick and a bottle. When she died, he and smith's boyfriend cut her body up into small pieces, covered them in christmas wrapping paper, and placed the packets in upper west side trash bins. In her death, the lebanon, pennsylvania-born smith was vilified as an easy woman by some and painted as a lamb in a rough town by others. Lost in the headlines was the larger plight of unwed mothers, the laws impeding access to contraception for both sexes, and the dearth of good sex education, notes frank: \" on christmas eve 1955, jacqueline smith was 20 years old and had her whole life ahead of her. The men who killed her went to jail, but there was no indictment of a society and policies that were also culpable. For too many americans, jacqueline smith's past is still all too present. \" read frank's full piece, which relies on old newspaper accounts and court records, here.",

The case is causing a furor in britain, not least because it has to do with britain's national sovereignty. The european court has stopped the british from kicking abu qatada out of the u.k. And deporting him to jordan, his home country, to stand trial there. Npr's philip reeves has been following the case and joins us from london. Phil, thanks for being with us."

The team scanned the brains of 20 volunteers on the drug and discovered that not only did it increase connectivity between parts of the brain that usually perform specialized functions, many of those areas became involved in visual processing, leading to complex, dreamlike hallucinations and other visual effects, cnet reports. The researchers, whose study is published in the proceedings of the national academy of scientists, say the more \" unified \" brain they witnessed could explain why lsd users describe feeling more at one with the universe, and sometimes report increased well-being even long after the trip is over. \" this is to neuroscience what the higgs boson was to particle physics, \" senior researcher david nutt, once the british government's drug adviser, tells the guardian. He says scientists have \" waited 50 years for this moment, \" but \" enormous hurdles \" have made it difficult to research lsd since the drug was banned in the ' 60s. \" for the first time we can really see what's happening in the brain during the psychedelic state, and can better understand why lsd had such a profound impact on self-awareness in users and on music and art, \" he says. \" this could have great implications for psychiatry, and helping patients overcome conditions such as depression. \" ( the archives of the swiss chemist who invented lsd have had a \" long, strange trip. \" )",
