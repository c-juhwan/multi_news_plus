        "summary": "Now that critics have landed on actor stephen fry's head like a ton of bricks for suggesting women hate sex because they don't often screw strange men in bushes, at least one brit journalist is wondering, well, do women loathe sex? in fact, insists steve connor in the independent, fry is right in suggesting that men usually have more sexual relationships than women. That's because women, being more invested in the few offspring they create, tend to seek stable relationships with responsible males who can provide healthy genes and a nurturing home life, he adds. Men, on the other hand, are more evolutionarily driven to sow as many wild oats as possible to spread their genes as widely as possible. As for enjoying sex, the genders aren't so far apart. One \" mystery of human sexuality \" is the female orgasm, notes connor. \" humans may be one of the few species where females actually enjoy sex physically as much as males. \" there's no further word from fry, who has apparently quit twitter in a snit over the flap triggered by interview quotes he claims were taken out of context. Who cares what fry thinks anyway, snorts the telegraph. Asking fry, who is openly gay, to offer his views on female sexuality is like \" simon cowell turning up to conduct the royal philharmonic orchestra. \" ( women apparently don't hate bad sex.

        "summary": "East coast residents who made the most of a paralyzing weekend blizzard face fresh challenges as the workweek begins: slippery roads, spotty transit service, and mounds of snow that buried cars and blocked sidewalk entrances. For many, the weekend extends into monday because of closed schools and government offices. Officials were cautioning against unnecessary driving even as they expected some commuter trains to be delayed or canceled. The storm dropped snow from the gulf coast to new england, with near-record snowfalls tallied from washington, dc, to new york city. At least 30 deaths were blamed on the weather, with shoveling snow and breathing carbon monoxide together claiming almost as many lives as car crashes. More on the \" snowzilla \" aftermath: federal offices will be closed monday, and virginia's state workers were told to stay home. Schools from washington to the jersey shore gave students monday off. New york's transit authority says almost all mass transit services will be running in time for the monday morning rush hour, including nearly 80 % of the long island rail road. In washington, dc, authorities warn that it could be days before some streets are cleared, the washington post reports. Police chief cathy l. Lanier says drivers who venture out and get stuck will be fined $ 750 — and people may also be fined for walking in the streets. The house has declared a snow week and won't start voting again until feb. 1, while the senate will be back on wednesday, reports the hill. Nearly 12,000 flights were canceled over the weekend, and major airlines canceled hundreds more flights for monday. Along with clearing snow and ice from facilities and equipment, the operators of airlines, trains, and transit systems had to figure out how to get snowbound employees to work. Congressional leaders say they were saddened to learn of the blizzard-related death of capitol police officer vernon alston, politico reports. The 44-year-old, who had been on the force for 20 years, died of a heart attack after collapsing at his delaware home on saturday. Saturday's 26.6 inches of snow in new york city set a single-day record, though in washington, the records were less clear: the post reports that the official total recorded at reagan national airport is inaccurate because the snow-measuring device ended up getting buried in snow.",

So report researchers out of sweden in the journal plos medicine in finding that women whose bmi increases by two or more units — amounting to a roughly 12-pound gain in women of average height — between their first and second pregnancies pass on considerable risk to their second-born child. Scientists analyzed data on more than 525,000 second-born babies and found that the risk for all negative outcomes goes up, including seizures, a severe breathing condition involving choking on meconium, and asphyxia. And it all adds up with obesity at \" epidemic proportions, \" including among pregnant women. \" encouraging women to normalize bmi before pregnancy and to avoid weight gain between pregnancies is likely to be an important measure to improve infant health, \" the researchers note in a press release. In fact, the risk of babies born with a low apgar score rose sharply by between 33 % and 78 % when born to a woman who'd gained this much weight between pregnancies, the researchers found. The increase in risk was most pronounced among women who were at a normal weight, or bmi of less than 25, at the start of their first pregnancy and then gained weight between the two, reports medical daily. It adds that the study is \" strong \" in that it analyzes so many births and outcomes, but notes that the authors don't know how much weight was gained during pregnancy or when women gained weight between pregnancies.

A study released this week found that more women than men are now affected by the disease, while the reverse was true just two years ago. The condition is associated with a wide variety of health risks, from chronic diseases to reproductive problems — and in a new study published june 7 in plos medicine, researchers from the karolinska institutet in sweden found that gaining weight between pregnancies further complicates mothers ' and infants ' health. Already, research suggests that women who are overweight and obese during pregnancy face greater risk of certain complications, including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia.

A study released this week found that more women than men are now affected by the disease, while the reverse was true just two years ago. The condition is associated with a wide variety of health risks, from chronic diseases to reproductive problems — and in a new study published june 7 in plos medicine, researchers from the karolinska institutet in sweden found that gaining weight between pregnancies further complicates mothers ' and infants ' health.

But there's something special about hers: they're tiny, and the first part of an envisioned tiny home village where low-income detroiters can not only find safe and affordable housing, but work to achieve the otherwise impossible-seeming dream of homeownership. Fowler is the executive director of cass community social services, whose tiny homes project has thus far erected those well-equipped and well-built homes ( see a video tour here ) on seven of the 25 vacant lots that cnbc reports ccss bought from the city for $ 15,000. The houses cost about $ 50,000 each to build. Those now living in them ( 122 applied for the first seven homes; those chosen have an average annual income of just under $ 12,000, reports the christian science monitor ) pay $ 1 per square foot — meaning somewhere between $ 250 and $ 400 — plus cover electricity. They also participate in a homeowners association and take home maintenance and financial literacy classes. But what's so especially unique about the program is that after paying the rent for seven years, they will own the home outright. As for the genesis of the idea, the death of fowler's mother made her consider the subject of inheritance and, as the monitor writes, \" how the poor often miss out on what can be an important economic safeguard. \" now, \" you can earn as little as $ 750 a month and be a homeowner in seven years, \" she tells cnn.",

        "summary": "Sarah palin's troubled eldest son is in an alaska jail after his second domestic violence arrest in two years. Track palin was arrested saturday on a felony charge of burglary and misdemeanor charges of assault and mischief, ktuu reports. According to court records, all the charges against the 28-year-old, who was arraigned sunday morning, involve domestic violence. The charges, which suggest palin injured or attempted to injure somebody while committing burglary, appear to stem from an incident in wasilla, palin's hometown, the los angeles times reports. Palin, who spent a year in iraq while serving in the army, was arrested last year after allegedly punching and kicking his girlfriend before threatening to shoot himself. The case was resolved under a plea deal in a special court for veterans, with palin convicted of misconduct. \" given the nature of actions addressed last night by law enforcement and the charges involved, the palins are unable to comment further, \" family attorney john tiemessen said sunday, per reuters. \" they ask that the family's privacy is respected during this challenging situation just as others dealing with a struggling family member would also request. \" ( after the 2016 arrest, sarah palin suggested he was suffering from ptsd. )",

        "summary": "The british-built beagle 2 began its fall to mars on dec. 19, 2003. It was expected to land on the red planet on christmas day and begin its search for alien life ( its name is a nod to charles darwin's hms beagle ). But it was never heard from again. Now, high-resolution images snapped over the last two years by nasa's mars reconnaissance orbiter show the probe essentially just where it ought to be, within three miles of its target landing location, the bbc reports. It also appears intact. So what happened? the theory based on the images is that one or two of the probe's four \" petals \" holding its solar panels didn't deploy, perhaps due to a bad bounce or an airbag \" not separating sufficiently from the lander, \" mission manager prof. Mark sims says. \" without full deployment, there is no way we could have communicated with it as the radio frequency antenna was under the solar panels. \" the bbc now calls it \" one of [ the ] most glorious near-misses in the history of british exploration, \" and uk space agency scientists say the mission needs to be relabeled \" a great success. \" as sims puts it, the beagle 2 achieved a trio of feats: landing on mars, managing to enter its atmosphere, and being the first \" controlled landing \" on another planet. The bbc reports the probe can't be brought back to life, but \" this is not the end of the story, \" says sims. \" we will do more imaging and analysis. \" the discovery is bittersweet as it follows the death of principal investigator colin pillinger last year. He \" would be putting in his grant application to go and fix it, \" a researcher says, per the telegraph. His daughter adds, \" he would love that this could inspire that next generation to do beagle 3. \" ( in more mars news, click for a recent \" oh my gosh moment. \" )",

Yesterday's shooting was one of three so-called \" insider attacks, \" which the taliban claim proves its powers of infiltration. In paktia, an afghan police guard was shot during a firefight with nato troops. And in tirin kot, an afghan policeman apparently drugged then killed seven fellow officers.",

At the conservative hot air blog, allahpundit thinks the media is \" hyperventilating \" given that boehner has said much the same before. \" today's comments are boehner's way of preempting obama and signaling to the public that he's not opposed to all deals involving more tax revenue, just ones that involve rate hikes. His problem is that obama ' wins ' a stalemate here because inaction means the current rates will lapse automatically. \" the hill doesn't see boehner as being conciliatory, either. Rather, he has \" moved swiftly to claim an equal mandate with the president, \" it writes, and he's still not budging on higher tax rates. Boehner also shot down harry reid's hope to get this settled in the lame-duck congress.

Police say hollis daniels, a 19-year-old man who lived on campus, was arrested near lubbock municipal coliseum at 9: 35pm local time, almost two hours after he allegedly shot the officer at campus police headquarters and fled on foot, the lubbock avalanche-journal reports. The school says daniels, from seguin, near san antonio, was first taken into custody when police found drugs and drug paraphernalia after being called for a welfare check. Daniels was being processed for jail when \" he produced a weapon — it has yet to be determined the details of that — and mortally wounded one of our officers, \" says university police chief kyle bonath, per nbc news. Sources tell kcbd that daniels ripped off the slain officer's body camera after the shooting, but it was found about an hour after he was arrested. Texas tech president lawrence schovanec thanked the lubbock police department and other agencies that helped apprehend daniels, the daily toreador reports. \" the family of the deceased officer will be in the prayers of the entire texas tech community, \" he said. \" in the coming days, we ' ll be offering our full support to that family. \"",

Both zuckerberg and sandberg distanced themselves thursday from one of the more controversial aspects of the story — that facebook hired a republican opposition research company that tried to link anti-facebook protesters to george soros, reports the guardian. \" look, i learned about this reading in the new york times yesterday, \" zuckerberg said. \" as soon as i learned about this, i talked to our team and we're no longer working with this firm. \" the original investigative piece said that sandberg oversaw facebook's response to the russian hacking and thus was responsible for hiring the firm, definers public affairs. But she suggested an underling did the hiring. \" i did not know we hired them or about the work they were doing, but i should have, \" she wrote in a statement. \" i have great respect for george soros — and the anti-semitic conspiracy theories against him are abhorrent. \" the president of soros ' open society foundation called facebook's participation in the effort to go after soros \" reprehensible \" and \" frankly astonishing. \" ( a facebook exec's public support of brett kavanaugh didn't sit well with critics, either. )",

The 19-year-old had dismissed her mother's ultimatum to go to therapy and found herself out on her own, with $ 20 to her name at the time, she tells outsports. Her parents stopped paying her car insurance and other bills, dumped all her childhood items — stuffed animals, awards — into her car, and instructed her to not talk to them or her siblings again. Her mother texted her, \" you disgust me, \" she tells the buffalo news. Scheck buckled down, got two jobs, and relied on the kindness of her girlfriend, justyna wilkinson, and friends, who offered her food and the books she needed to study. The fundraiser set up by hausladen proved a success — it's at over $ 100,000 as of saturday — but there was one problem, per nbc news: under ncaa rules, if the girls accepted the outside funding, they wouldn't be eligible to be on the team anymore. The girls decided scheck's schooling was too important, so they accepted that fate. Last week, though, the ncaa posted some good news. \" emily scheck can retain her eligibility and continue to receive gofundme donations that assist her with living and educational expenses, \" the group tweeted, noting ncaa rules allow for waivers if a student has a \" significant life event. \" canisius college also said it will help scheck however it can. Her family, meanwhile, insists they accept scheck and just want her home. \" it's a private family matter, \" her father tells the news. \" we love our daughter. \" scheck remains wary.

        "summary": "Rebecca hardy jumped a fence and entered a backyard on thursday in port huron, mich., where she was mauled by two dogs and later died. It's been a mystery why the 22-year-old entered the yard, but the oakland county medical examiner's office has now ruled her death a suicide, the port huron times herald reports. No details as to what's behind the ruling have been reported. After hardy entered the yard, a witness tried to stop the dogs — a pit bull and a pit bull-husky mix — from attacking her and then alerted the dogs ' owner to what was happening; the owner eventually got the dogs off of hardy, but she died at a hospital after extensive facial and neck injuries. The two adult dogs were euthanized friday, along with a puppy also owned by the same person, after the owner gave consent. But he later rescinded that consent, and three puppies who had not yet been euthanized were saved. The three-week-old puppies are currently with an animal rescue organization foster family, being hand-fed, the times herald reports. Hardy's fiance lives on 10th street, where the house with the dogs is located, and he previously speculated she may have been trying to cut through the yard to get from an alleyway behind the house to 10th street. He lives just a block from the house, cbs detroit reports, and the huron daily tribune says hardy lived with him, along with their 18-month-old daughter. ( this equally unusual suicide involved a reptile. )",

Though james had a number of health issues, including sleep apnea, epilepsy, and hearing and sight problems, his parents say he \" wasn't a fragile boy. \" but he did need his breathing monitored because of the sleep apnea, which can cause life-threatening breaks in breathing, the guardian reports. After the operation, james was conscious and was able to talk to his siblings on facetime. His father left his room in the pediatric intensive care unit in the wee hours of the morning, and at 1: 15am, the equipment monitoring his vital signs was turned off. The report found that staffers who shut off the equipment did not consult with superiors. James was found to be unresponsive at 3: 58am, and the report concludes that he ultimately died of brain damage and cardiac arrest as a result of the equipment being turned off. A lawyer calls it a \" huge, unforgivable error \" — and adds that it's also not clear how long it took hospital staff to call for a resuscitation \" crash \" team after discovering james; it could have been as long as 20 minutes. James ' parents are pursuing legal action against portland hospital, which the evening standard notes is the uk's largest private children's hospital. His mother calls the boy's death \" completely heartbreaking, \" per the bbc. ( a pastor was charged in his toddler granddaughter's pneumonia death. )",

        "summary": "A new study raises concerns for those who indulge in potent forms of marijuana. Researchers out of king's college london and rome's sapienza university studied brain scans of 56 patients who had reported an episode of psychosis and 43 healthy volunteers. They found that those who regularly smoked high-strength cannabis showed small changes in the region of the brain that sends messages between the left and right sides, reports the guardian. The alteration in this region, called the corpus callosum, \" reflects a problem in the white matter that ultimately makes it less efficient, \" says neurobiologist paola dazzan. The brains of people who had never used cannabis or smoked less potent forms looked normal, leading researchers to conclude that high-strength versions, like skunk, may damage nerve fibers. The uk times reports the damage is similar to the effects of a concussion. \" we don't know exactly what it means for the person, but it suggests there is less efficient transfer of information, \" dazzan says, per yahoo. So what's doing the damage? dazzan believes it's the thc in cannabis; less potent varieties contain 2 % to 4 % thc, while more potent forms contain 10 % to 14 %. The chemical acts on the cannabinoid receptors found in the corpus callosum, according to a release. Though researchers haven't proven cannabis is responsible for the changes, \" it is extremely important to gather information on how often and what type of cannabis is being used, \" dazzan says. \" these details can help quantify the risk of mental health problems and increase awareness of the type of damage these substances can do. \" ( potent pot also raises your psychosis risk. )",

Smokers also have the option of growing up to six marijuana plants in their home — or joining clubs that can grow up to 99 plants a year. The push for legalization was spearheaded by president josé mujica, who says he is against drug consumption but wants to take the business away from violent drug cartels. To prevent drug tourism, only residents will be allowed to buy weed legally and the government has promised to take steps to stop people from exporting legally-bought marijuana to neighboring countries, the bbc reports. \" this won't be a weed-for-all country, \" mujica says.",

He was at a dock in maryland wednesday evening when he heard a mayday call, grabbed a crew, and rescued 22 people, including 14 children, whose boat had sunk in a remote area about 35 minutes north of him, wbal reports. The school group's boat went down after hitting a submerged object in a restricted area around bloodsworth island, which the navy used as a bombing range for more than 50 years. Shockley arrived to find the shivering group on the sunken boat's canopy, more than half a mile from shore. He managed to squeeze them all on his boat and get them to safety, where some of them required medical attention. Shockley tells the washington post that he thought he would be rescuing a fishing party of two or three people. \" i just couldn't imagine it. Seeing children sit on top of the boat like that, \" the waterman says, adding that the tide \" runs hard \" in that area and the situation could have easily been a disaster.

Marco rubio was the only candidate to field a question on flint, which he claims democrats turned into a partisan issue. \" all of us are outraged by what happened, \" the washington post quotes rubio. \" i don't think someone woke up one morning and said, ' let's poison the water system. ' \" rubio credited michigan gov. Rick snyder for taking accountability for the crisis. Earlier thursday, a flint mother filed a lawsuit against a handful of government employees and corporations she believes are responsible for poisoning her four children with lead-tainted drinking water, according to michigan live. Critics immediately jumped on rubio's statements on flint. \" rick snyder poisoned thousands of children, and marco rubio's biggest concern is that people are blaming snyder for it, \" a thinkprogress editor tweeted. \" i don't think the issue w/ #flintwatercrisis is somebody thought about poisoning kids. It's that nobody thought about how not to, \" added a hillary clinton staffer. After rubio's answer to the flint question, the debate moved on to discussing detroit's failing schools.",

        "summary": "Scientists might be able to predict how long you ' ll live based on... What your friends think of you. So says a study published in psychological science, in which researchers found that subjects whose friends viewed them as more conscientious and open tended to have longer lives. The men seen as the most conscientious had a 30 % lower mortality risk than average; the women considered the most emotionally stable and agreeable had a 15 % lower risk. How come you can't just rank yourself to predict when you ' ll die? as pacific standard explains, \" your friends ' beliefs about your traits are, when averaged, more reliable than your own. \" ( researchers found a weaker connection between mortality and how men assessed themselves, while women's self-assessments were actually inaccurate at predicting longevity, psych central reports. ) not only might you be biased, the way you see yourself could change based on external variables. Other studies that have linked personality traits to health and mortality are more limited than this one, because they have relied on subjects rating their own traits. So, in this case, researchers used data from the kelly longitudinal study, in which 300 young married couples were assessed starting in the mid-1930s. Part of the study involved three to eight friends of each couple answering questions about their personalities. Researchers then compared those results to death records ( or confirmation, in some cases, that the subjects had not yet died ) for all but seven of the subjects. Of course, it should be noted that the friends ' assessments were taken decades ago — when, the huffington post notes, people may have had different ideas about what it means to be an \" agreeable \" and \" emotionally stable \" woman. ( another recent study found that optimism is good for your heart. )",

The targeted offices span 49 states. The exception: delaware, which has only one post office for every 12,000 people. About 2,500 of those that may close will be replaced by a \" village post office \": one postal clerk in a local shop, gas station, library, or other community building. \" village \" sites would only offer basic services; for example, passports and money orders would not be available, the washington post reports. Most of the offices targeted for closure bring in less than $ 27,500 annually but cost more than $ 100,000 to run. The planned closures could save $ 200 million per year, a drop in the bucket compared to the $ 8 billion the agency is expected to lose for the second consecutive year. Over the next decade, postal officials will review half of its 32,000 post offices for closure. For many in small communities, the idea is devastating: \"it's part of the culture of the town, \" says one chevy chase resident. \"it has a small-town kind of feel. \" click for more upcoming changes from the postal service.",

The los angeles times points out that even though the walt disney co. Recently reported \" better-than-expected profit, \" an online survey funded by labor groups of employees at disneyland park in anaheim, calif., as well as at california adventure park located on the same disneyland resort property, found that nearly three-quarters of the workers said they don't make enough money to pay for basic expenses like rent, gas, and groceries. The \" working for the mouse \" poll also reports that 11 % of disneyland resort employees have said they were homeless or without a place to sleep at some point over the past two years. For workers with young kids, that number rises to 13 %. The survey, conducted by occidental college's urban &amp; environmental policy institute and the nonprofit economic roundtable, was paid for by nine labor groups pushing for higher wages. In addition to citing a 15 % drop in the average wage from 2000 to 2017, from $ 15.80 an hour to $ 13.36, the survey notes \" erratic work schedules, \" long commutes — the new york times says many employees live further inland, where it's more affordable — and an \" extraordinary pay gap \" between top management and the rank and file. What keeps some employees on board: the lack of other jobs, perks like free park tickets, and even disney nostalgia from their own childhoods. Disney officials say, by their own numbers, workers make, on average, $ 17.80 an hour; a company rep calls the survey \" inaccurate, \" \" unscientific, \" and \" paid for by politically motivated labor unions. \"",

            "Rielle hunter has some artistic differences with the photographer who shot her sexy photos for gq. But she is apparently a fan of this new exhibit at the guggenheim. Today a reader spotted her and john edwards there getting cultured. Writes our eagle-eyed spy: john edwards and rielle hunter on line, appropriately enough, for contemplating the void at the guggenheim at around 1pm today. They looked sporty and well-matched. Nobody seemed to be noticing them. This sighting backs up the spine-shivering enquirer report that edwards proposed to hunter. But fyi, the whole \" nobody noticing them \" thing was the new tino sehgal performance art piece. It's called what we wish would happen regarding john edwards and rielle hunter in real life."

        "summary": "It's sound advice that anyone thinking about grad school should be \" fully funded, \" writes megan mcardle at bloomberg. That is, your tuition should be covered by a research or teaching stipend. After all, if a ph.d. Program accepts you without such funding, what that really means is the school is \" willing to take your money, but not willing to invest in you. \" the problem, oddly, is that being fully funded is often \" not nearly enough, \" writes mcardle. She uses this spreadsheet on student debt to make the point. On it, students explain how they managed to pile up six-figure debt. The reasons vary: for some, \" the money didn't last as long as required to actually complete and defend their dissertation, \" often because the students got married or had kids. Or they had to pay for travel. Or they lived in cities with an especially high cost of living that swamped their stipend. Meanwhile, the interest on their undergrad debt piled up. The spreadsheet is likely skewed toward those with debt problems, notes mcardle, but it still serves up a valuable lesson: \" it's not enough to have funding. You also need to have a time frame, and a budget, that fits the funding on offer. \" click for the full post.",

Dumb move or one long overdue? take your pick: bad move: the us oversaw icann to ensure a free internet.

Raul fernando gomez cincunegui had crossed from his native uruguay into chile, but after his motorcycle broke down he set off on the return voyage on foot, reports the afp. He ended up instead getting turned around in a snowstorm. Gomez survived on rats caught using a homemade trap, raisins, and supplies he found in a shelter located some 9,318 feet above sea level, though he is said to have lost 44 pounds in the process, reports the daily telegraph. Argentine officials found him in that shelter, which they reached via helicopter, while in the northwestern province of san juan observing snowfall levels, reports the bbc.

House lawmakers took off for their august recess yesterday after refusing to consider a five-year measure to aid america's stricken farmers, reports the new york times. Instead, they passed a stopgap $ 383 million disaster aid bill to help some livestock producers hit hard by this summer's devastating drought, along with a modest group of farmers. A bipartisan five-year farm measure has already made it through the senate, which refused to take up the house's measure. The house disaster package, which provides assistance to cattle and sheep farmers but not to pork or poultry operations, \" is a sad substitute for what is really needed — a long term farm policy, \" complained the ranking democrat on the house agriculture committee. The committee's republican chairman urged his colleagues to \" go home and discuss the drought in that 65 % of united states that is suffering \" before coming back with the momentum to pass a farm bill, politico reports.",

Stabenow took to the senate floor to say that lawmakers would instead work informally over the august recess to try to put together a new measure to present to congress when it meets in september. The white house would have considered the house measure, but she resisted, senate aides said. Photo ms. Stabenow, who worked for months to arm-twist resistant senate colleagues on both side of the aisle to usher her bill through her chamber, said she would begin meeting with house agriculture leaders on thursday night. \"i am extremely hopeful that we can get together around what really needs to be done, which is a five-year farm bill, \" she said. The failure to advance the farm bill or the emergency aid was all the more striking given the extent of the continuing drought, with county after county across the nation having been declared an agricultural disaster area.

The hastily assembled livestock bill — adopted 223-197 — promises some political cover for republican candidates in farm states. But it quickly stalled thursday night in the senate where the agriculture committee leadership is demanding that the house first deal with the larger farm bill. Story continued below \"by refusing to bring up the farm bill, house leadership is doing what congress always does — kicking the can down the road instead of coming together to solve problems, \" said sen. Debbie stabenow ( d-mich. ), who chairs the senate agriculture panel. \"if congress does not pass a farm bill, there will be no reform, direct payments will continue, we ' ll lose the opportunity for major deficit reduction and we ' ll deliver a real blow to our economic recovery. \" indeed, this continued impasse over the much larger five-year measure remains a serious liability for the gop going into november's elections.

            "Moments after the house passed its bill, ms. Stabenow took to the senate floor to say that lawmakers would instead work informally over the august recess to try to put together a new measure to present to congress when it meets in september. The white house would have considered the house measure, but she resisted, senate aides said. Photo ms. Stabenow, who worked for months to arm-twist resistant senate colleagues on both side of the aisle to usher her bill through her chamber, said she would begin meeting with house agriculture leaders on thursday night. \"i am extremely hopeful that we can get together around what really needs to be done, which is a five-year farm bill, \" she said. The failure to advance the farm bill or the emergency aid was all the more striking given the extent of the continuing drought, with county after county across the nation having been declared an agricultural disaster area. Advertisement continue reading the main story the farm bill, which has historically appealed to members on both sides of the aisle, was one of a series of measures that fell victim to partisan fighting — and occasionally infighting — in recent weeks. On thursday, a bipartisan cybersecurity bill that would have established standards for the computer systems that oversee the country's critical infrastructure was stopped by a filibuster as some leading republicans yielded to",
            "One lawmaker labeled the bill a ' bovine bailout. ' house passes drought, disaster aid with its five-year farm bill relegated to the back pasture, the house headed home for august after narrowly approving a stopgap $ 383 million disaster aid package to help tide over cattle and sheep operations affected by this summer's severe drought. The hastily assembled livestock bill — adopted 223-197 — promises some political cover for republican candidates in farm states. But it quickly stalled thursday night in the senate where the agriculture committee leadership is demanding that the house first deal with the larger farm bill. Story continued below \"by refusing to bring up the farm bill, house leadership is doing what congress always does — kicking the can down the road instead of coming together to solve problems, \" said sen. Debbie stabenow ( d-mich. ), who chairs the senate agriculture panel. \"if congress does not pass a farm bill, there will be no reform, direct payments will continue, we ' ll lose the opportunity for major deficit reduction and we ' ll deliver a real blow to our economic recovery. \" indeed, this continued impasse over the much larger five-year measure remains a serious liability for the gop going into november's elections. The disaster package \"is a sad substitute for what is really needed — a long term farm policy, \" said minnesota"

        "summary": "A phone call between donald trump and pakistani pm nawaz sharif took place on monday, and pakistan's press office took a most unusual step afterward: it released on wednesday what appears to be a transcript of what trump said, the washington post reports. \" appears \" comes into play because the dialogue certainly seems to be in trump's distinct voice, but there are no quotation marks included. Per the news office, trump called sharif \" a terrific guy \" who's \" doing amazing work, \" said \" pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people, \" and mentioned he'd love to visit such a \" fantastic country. \" he also reportedly said, \" i am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play. \" trump's office didn't confirm with cnn whether that interpretation was accurate, putting out a statement that simply said the parties \" had a productive conversation about how the united states and pakistan will have a strong working relationship in the future. \" but experts in these types of calls say they're usually more formal, and cnn's david gergen notes the president would usually have a press aide and/or national security advisers by his side during the call — probably important with a president who's blasted pakistan in the past. Time calls the alleged conversation \" reckless and bizarre, \" laying out the complex, tense relationship between nuclear powers pakistan and neighboring india. \" the … president-elect's ill-considered words could have serious regional and global consequences, \" it notes. Forbes agrees, stating the conversation illustrates \" he shows no awareness of the issues. \" and the new republic rails on trump for continuing \" to speak to foreign leaders on a personal line and without preparation, \" adding, \" with one phone call, donald trump might have upturned america's relationship with both pakistan and india. \" ( gingrich thinks trump's tweets need oversight. )",

        "summary": "President obama was full of confidence during a state of the union address last night that some pundits are calling a \" victory lap, \" celebrating his most progressive policies and outlining an ambitious vision for the future. \" we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on earth, \" he said. \" it's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come. \" some reactions: \" obama was speaking not just to the present but to the future, to the 2016 presidential elections and even beyond, \" writes the new york times editorial board. \" by simply raising the plight of the middle class ( and, looming behind it, the larger issue of economic inequality ), he has firmly inserted issues of economic fairness into the political debate, \" they write, describing his rhetoric as \" combative, even defiant in parts \" — but his proposal was far from radical. The president, with an \" unabashed pitch for expansive government action on the economy, scientific research, infrastructure, education, and the environment, \" made it clear he is committed to \" cementing a liberal legacy \" and will fiercely fight any attempts by the gop-controlled congress to roll back his achievements, writes juliet eilperin at the washington post. The fact that most of obama's proposals have no hope of passing congress wasn't lost on jonah goldberg at the national review, who saw the speech as a well-delivered but unimpressive rollout of obama's \" golden oldies. \" it's one thing to claim to be against cynicism when you're a \" rookie politician, \" he writes. \" it's quite another to start the sixth year of your presidency cynically trolling the opposition with proposals you know cannot pass while decrying the political gamesmanship and partisanship of your opponents. \" some analysts compare last night's obama to the obama of 2004 or 2008, but jamelle bouie at slate looks back a lot farther. Obama's \" confident, assertive liberalism, \" he writes, strongly recalls the immediate postwar period when \" democratic governance was broadly popular and ascendant \" and president truman made it clear in his sixth sotu address that government \" has a place in securing prosperity and protecting ordinary people. \" the \" liberated and victorious \" obama of last night reminded adam kirk edgerton at the huffington post of 2008, but while he found the speech \" surprisingly moving, \" he thinks obama has left it far too late to be remembered as a great liberal president.

        "summary": "As the story goes, before queen elizabeth's 1953 coronation, britain asked france if it might borrow the storied bayeux tapestry. The answer was no. Heinrich himmler was also unsuccessful in transferring it to nazi germany. The 220-foot-long tapestry, which is on permanent display in bayeux, france, has not left that country in some 950 years. That looks set to change. Multiple outlets are reporting that upon his arrival in the uk thursday, french president emmanuel macron will announce that the tapestry will be loaned to england, though not for a few years and only if tests show the 11th-century tapestry — which details the norman conquest of england, complete with king harold dying with an arrow in his eye — can be safely moved. There is some speculation that the tapestry was actually created in kent, england, reports the guardian, and the times of london writes the decision to loan it \" would be a huge gesture towards les anglais \" — and a fraught one, as bright light, extreme temperatures, humidity, and moths could ruin it. The bbc reports a british museum believes it was commissioned in the 1070s by the half-brother of william the conqueror; the historical trail doesn't start until 1476, when it appears on an inventory of bayeux cathedral. One interesting line of speculation: whether the uk will loan france something equally impressive. One member of parliament suggests temporarily parting with the rosetta stone, which was likely uncovered by the french — specifically by soldiers of napoleon in egypt.

But santorum has actually proven to be pretty good at counterattacks, and his team is confident — one adviser mocks romney as easy prey because he sticks to \" pavlovian \" responses.

What elevates the argument occurring in spokane, wash., isn't just that a lawsuit was involved — but that it was sealed. The los angeles times has the story, in which homeowner 1 happens to be spokane county superior court judge michael price, who alleged his neighbor's cat wasn't deterred by the fence between the two homes and was making his back porch reek of urine and unusable. Price reportedly sought a restraining order against jennifer tanaka-fees in order to restrain her cat, and that became the lawsuit, which has been settled — and the whole thing was sealed in november. Now ucla law professor eugene volokh is trying to reverse that after learning about the case from tanaka-fees ' lawyer. He tells the times he \" found no justification for the sealing, \" which he sees out of step with the first amendment. A hearing on volokh's motion to unseal the case records hit a roadblock friday when judge patrick monasmith, who originally sealed them, recused himself over a conflict of interest with price's attorney, bob dunn, reports the spokesman-review. A new judge will be put on the case. In the meantime, the spokesman-review quotes dunn as saying the records needed to be sealed to keep price's address from vengeful criminals whom price has sentenced. \" he's presided over some of the most notorious murder cases in spokane county in the past few years, \" dunn said.",
