Abc australia says the 17-year-old was surfing with her dad near the kelp beds surfing break, off of esperance, at the same beach where a surfer suffered serious injuries from a shark attack in 2014. The girl was attacked around 4pm while her mom and sisters watched from the shore, perthnow notes. Paramedics tried to help her on the beach, but she was soon taken to a local hospital in critical condition, and died of her injuries, per local cops. Although police haven't said what kind of shark may have killed the teen, perthnow says a local shark-watch site flagged two sightings nearby of great white sharks ( perhaps the same one ) in the week before the attack.

The body of sebastian woodroffe was found in a shallow grave saturday in the ucayali region of peru's amazon by police who began searching for the 41-year-old after a video was posted to social media that showed him being dragged on the ground with a rope around his neck until his body goes limp. One early theory, according to local media and a police officer who spoke with the guardian, is that he was killed over the murder of olivia arévalo, an octogenarian shaman from the shipibo-konibo tribe who was shot dead thursday. Woodroffe's body was buried a little more than half-a-mile from the site where she was killed, and he was thought to be one of her clients. But while one potential motive being investigated is that arévalo's son owed woodroffe money, another theory is that the same son owed money to a gang member who pulled the trigger. And the ap says authorities have \" backed away \" from reports that woodroffe is even a suspect. The bbc reports woodroffe had been in peru previously to try the hallucinogen ayahuasca, and that he was looking to start a new career involving the use of \" plant medicine \" in drug addiction treatment. The guardian cites a years-old indiegogo campaign that helped fund a trip from his vancouver island home to peru; on the campaign page he referenced a relative's alcohol addiction and wrote, \" traditional detox centres have a 5-8 % success rate. Unacceptable. \" the cbc reports woodroffe, who was apparently also killed thursday, leaves behind a 9-year-old son.",

For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the urls for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl ( and therefore we never got to them ).

        "summary": "The cdc warned american hospitals last year to keep an eye out for the emergence of a possibly fatal, drug-resistant yeast infection, and now the agency's fears may be realized. Cdc officials tell the washington post that 35 patients in the us have been stricken with candida auris, a fungus that can cause bloodstream, wound, and ear infections, with another 18 people harboring the microbe without becoming ill. Some strains of the pathogen don't respond to the three main classes of antifungal drugs, and based on the small number of cases health officials have had the chance to review, 60 % of patients hit with c. Auris have died ( though the agency notes many of those patients had other serious medical issues they were contending with ). The fungus is contagious and durable, especially in health care facilities, where it can stick around on furniture and other equipment for months. The first c. Auris strain was reported in 2009 in a japanese man, and it has since spread around the globe, including to colombia, india, israel, kenya, kuwait, pakistan, south korea, venezuela, and the uk. The first us case was reported in 2013, and the cdc's latest report places 28 of the incidents in new york state, with other affected states including new jersey, maryland, massachusetts, and illinois. Cdc acting director anne schuchat said at a recent briefing that \" scary, \" \" difficult to combat \" drug-resistant microorganisms are on the rise, per the post. Some good news is that c. Auris hasn't morphed yet into new strains, and most people's chances of contracting it are very low, with it only affecting \" the sickest of the sick, \" says cdc infectious disease specialist tom chiller.

Epipen, a device that delivers a dose of epinephrine that can stop an extreme allergic reaction, has been credited with saving the lives of children for whom a peanut or a bee sting could be fatal. But drugmaker mylan has hiked the price of the device by nearly 500 % over the past few years, cbs news reports, and parents and doctors aren't happy. \" when epinephrine only costs a few cents, but they're going up to $ 500, personally i don't think that's ethically responsible, \" allergy specialist dr. Douglas mcmahon told nbc news. \"patients are calling and saying they can't afford it. \" ( mcmahon is seeking fda approval for his own device that he says will cost $ 50. ) twice in her seven years, ellie henegar's life was saved with an epipen, but her parents were stunned last year when the bill came to $ 600, they told cbs. Compare that to 2009, when the bill was about $ 100 for the same two-pack of epipen. While insurance covers varying degrees of the cost, not everyone is lucky enough to have a plan that does, nbc notes. With a near monopoly, mylan has little incentive to cut the price, bloomberg reports. In fact, mylan execs considered dumping the aging product in 2007. Instead, they launched a marketing campaign that turned the device into an essential, donating epipens to schools and dropping $ 35 million on tv ads. A law passed by congress in 2013 requiring schools to stock epinephrine devices also boosted sales, which last year totaled $ 1 billion. Mylan contends it has made a \" significant investment \" to improve the device and offers coupons. \" it's a totally established brand name with little competition, \" bloomberg's robert langreth tells cbs. \" that gives them freedom to raise the price every year. \"",

            "In a 2007 purchase of medicines from merck kgaa, drugmaker mylan picked up a decades-old product, the epipen auto injector for food allergy and bee-sting emergencies. Management first thought to divest the aging device, which logged only $ 200 million in revenue. Then heather bresch, now mylan's chief executive officer, hit on the idea of using old-fashioned marketing in part to boost sales among concerned parents of children with allergies. That started epipen, which delivers about $ 1 worth of the hormone epinephrine, on a run that's resulted in its becoming a $ 1 billion-a-year product that clobbers its rivals and provides about 40 percent of mylan's operating profits, says researcher abr &#124; healthco.

        "summary": "An old-school form of discipline remains popular in alabama. The education department's office for civil rights has found that almost 19,000 children — 2.5 % of the state's students — got paddled in public schools during the 2013-2014 school year, reports al.com. Boys get hit more than girls, and black children were paddled at a disproportionate rate compared to whites. It's a long-standing ( and legal ) disciplinary tradition in the state that locals don't seem terribly motivated to change: the national education association wants the practice banned, but the alabama education association has stayed mum — despite the fact that it's illegal to paddle an adult in the state, per an opinion piece on al.com. Unicef's \" violence against children \" report doesn't exactly support paddling enthusiasts, noting that studies have linked corporal punishment to poor mental health, social issues, and academic problems. And many educational and child advocacy groups, including the american psychological association and the american academy of pediatrics, agree it's ill-advised. But a 1977 supreme court decision ruled corporal punishment was not cruel and unusual and that schools could decide whether to use it — and in 1995, alabama lawmakers gave public schools the right to do so. Most of the states that allow paddling ( 21 states reported it in the 2013- ' 14 school year ) are in the south. ( fifty years of spanking studies analyzed here. )",

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease ( chd ) — which the mayo clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation — yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the new england journal of medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with chd between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \" it's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off, \" lead researcher dr. Sripal bangalore at the new york university school of medicine tells the new york times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports medical news today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124 % more deaths, 136 % more strokes, and 117 % more heart attacks, meaning these chd patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with chd whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further. ( yo-yo dieting is bad for women's hearts in general. )",

            "Coronary artery disease develops when the major blood vessels that supply your heart with blood, oxygen and nutrients ( coronary arteries ) become damaged or diseased. Cholesterol-containing deposits ( plaque ) in your arteries and inflammation are usually to blame for coronary artery disease. When plaque builds up, they narrow your coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. Eventually, the decreased blood flow may cause chest pain ( angina ), shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack. Because coronary artery disease often develops over decades, you might not notice a problem until you have a significant blockage or a heart attack.

        "summary": "New parents will do almost anything to relieve their little ones'teething pain — but one thing the fda says they shouldn't do is give their babies homeopathic teething products, live science reports. In a sept. 30 statement, the fda warns these \" natural \" tablets and gels found in some chain drugstores and online can pose medical risks to infants and young children, from constipation and agitation to more serious issues such as breathing problems and seizures. \" teething can be managed without prescription or over-the-counter remedies, \" says janet woodcock, director of the agency's center for drug evaluation and research. Per the national institutes of health, homeopathy is an alternative ( and little-proven ) type of medical treatment that works on the theory that using tiny amounts of natural substances that usually cause ailments can actually help treat them. And for years, the fda has been on the case of homeopathic teething tablets and gels, which aren't evaluated or approved by the agency: in 2010, it sent out an alert about hyland's teething tablets, which contained \" inconsistent \" amounts of belladonna ( also known as deadly nightshade ), popular science reports. So what else are desperate parents to do? per live science and the american academy of pediatrics, everything from hard, unsweetened teething crackers to pacifiers, clean wet washcloths, and refrigerated ( not frozen ) teething rings can work as soothers. In advance of the fda's announcement, cvs announced it was pulling all homeopathic teething products, while hyland's issued a statement saying its products are safe, per drug store news.

Cnnmoney reports that while it's pricey, gold is a popular choice in consumer electronics for being corrosion resistant yet excellent at conducting electricity. ( silver is a superior conductor but corrodes easily. ) in march, apple unveiled an experimental bot called liam, which can disassemble an iphone in 11 seconds and sort its parts for recycling.

Why? it's not just about the odd collision; whale-watching seems to stress out the whales, nature reports following a symposium in scotland. When they spot a boat — whose operators know where the preferred feeding grounds are — the whales may opt to skip a meal or hurry away. In iceland's minke whales, the rush to escape looks a lot like an effort to flee a predator, with heavy breathing and a boost in speed, researchers say. Meanwhile, dolphins in new zealand — whose numbers have been dropping, researchers find — appear to be focusing on dodging tourists rather than eating. As for a solution, some areas suggest a distance boats must keep from the creatures, but the standards aren't usually officially required. \"whale-watching is traditionally seen as green tourism, \" says a us wildlife biologist. \"the negative is the potential for disturbance. That disturbance is a worry because we don't want to do 'death by 1,000 cuts.

Vanessa williams-grey, head of the responsible whale watch program at the whale and dolphin conservation society, told the bbc in 2011 that the industry could be harmful to marine mammals. \"badly run trips can translate into all sorts of negative reactions from the whales, \" said williams-grey. \"they can stop resting or increase their respiratory rate. If they are using more energy, this will have an impact on their health. \" other scientists champion whale"

Two researchers from baylor university recently published a study after looking at the break habits of 95 workers to identify a better break. \" what we found was that a better workday break was not composed of many of the things we believed, \" researcher emily hunter says in a press release. For example, it turns out, midmorning — not afternoon — is the best time for a break. \" you should pace yourself, similar to how plants should be watered early in the day before getting distressed from a long day in the sun, \" hunter tells the huffington post. Second, don't use the time to run errands. Breaks should be composed of an activity you enjoy — even, counterintuitively, if it's work-related. ( like some kind of \" passion project, \" in the words of huffpo. ) finally, the researchers found frequent, smaller breaks are ideal over a singular, longer break. \" unlike your cellphone, which popular wisdom tells us should be depleted to 0 % before you charge it fully to 100 %, people instead need to charge more frequently throughout the day, \" hunter says. While they didn't identify an ideal break length, the huffington post reports previous studies have shown as little as five minutes away from work can improve productivity. By following their advice for better breaks, researchers say employees will experience less mental and physical burnout. ( others say a lunchtime walk will cure your work woes. )",

In a new study, researchers from baylor university found, our health, productivity and job satisfaction can suffer when we don't make good use of the time we take to step away from work-related activities. For the study, researchers asked 95 employees to record all the breaks they took over the course of a workweek, which added up to a total of 959 breaks, or an average of two breaks per person each day.

Priced its initial public offering at $ 10 per share on thursday afternoon — the high end of the expected range for the deal, signaling strong investor demand for the maker of social games. Reuters zynga ceo mark pincus introduced new games at the company's san francisco headquarters on oct. 11. Zynga znga, +10.45 % will begin trading on the nasdaq on friday morning under the ticker symbol znga. Late thursday, the company priced 100 million shares at $ 10 per share. It had previously filed papers with the securities and exchange commission to sell its shares at a range of $ 8.50-$ 10 apiece. Zynga is the latest in a series of high-profile internet ipos this year that has included social network linkedin corp. Lnkd, +1.19 % and online daily deals site groupon inc. Grpn, +1.67 % social networking giant facebook inc. Is expected to debut next year, though some rumors have indicated that the company could make its initial filing within the next few weeks. Scott sweet of ipo boutique said his clients were surprised with the zynga pricing, given that past deals in the internet and social networking space priced above their filed range. \"we were expecting above-range pricing. Certainly this deal had more demand than jive software, \" sweet said, referring to a provider of social networking software that debuted earlier this week after pricing its ipo at $ 12 — above its expected range of $ 8-$ 10. Sweet added, however, that zynga took \"a sensible approach \" in not trying to get too much money too soon — leaving the door open for a possible secondary offering down the road. He said he was \"very pleased \" with the pricing. Underwriters for zynga have been granted an additional 15 million shares to cover over-allotments. Morgan stanley and goldman sachs are the lead",

            "San francisco ( marketwatch ) — zynga inc. Priced its initial public offering at $ 10 per share on thursday afternoon — the high end of the expected range for the deal, signaling strong investor demand for the maker of social games. Reuters zynga ceo mark pincus introduced new games at the company's san francisco headquarters on oct. 11. Zynga znga, +10.45 % will begin trading on the nasdaq on friday morning under the ticker symbol znga. Late thursday, the company priced 100 million shares at $ 10 per share. It had previously filed papers with the securities and exchange commission to sell its shares at a range of $ 8.50-$ 10 apiece. Zynga is the latest in a series of high-profile internet ipos this year that has included social network linkedin corp. Lnkd, +1.19 % and online daily deals site groupon inc. Grpn, +1.67 % social networking giant facebook inc. Is expected to debut next year, though some rumors have indicated that the company could make its initial filing within the next few weeks. Scott sweet of ipo boutique said his clients were surprised with the zynga pricing, given that past deals in the internet and social networking space priced above their filed range. \"we were expecting above-range pricing. Certainly this deal had more demand than jive software, \" sweet said, referring to a provider of social networking software that debuted earlier this week after pricing its ipo at $ 12 — above its expected range of $ 8-$ 10. Sweet added, however, that zynga took \"a sensible approach \" in not trying to get too much money too soon — leaving the door open for a possible secondary offering down the road. He said he was \"very pleased \" with the pricing. Underwriters for zynga have been granted an additional 15 million shares to cover over-allotments. Morgan stanley and goldman sachs are the lead",

        "summary": "The world is becoming more egalitarian, with men doing a much larger share of things like cooking and childcare these days. \" it's seen as socially admirable and masculine for a man to be on diaper duty or to sous-vide a steak, \" writes jessica grose, whose own husband handles half the midnight baby feedings. \" but there are no closet organizing tips in the pages of esquire, no dishwasher detergent ads in the pages of gq, \" and her husband hasn't scoured a single toilet during their six-year relationship. Cleaning, she writes for the new republic, is the \" final feminist frontier. \" she shares a few theories as to why ( cleaning just isn't fun, laundry detergent is still marketed as a women's product ) but ultimately posits that society's instinct is to blame the mess on the woman. \" unfortunately, the notion that women will be the first to be judged for a messy home and the first to be commended for an orderly one isn't much of an incentive for men to pick up a mop, \" she writes. But in new york, jonathan chait sees something else at work: women simply have higher cleanliness standards. The underlying assumption is \" that there is a correct level of cleanliness in a heterosexual relationship, and that level is determined by the female. I think a little cultural relativism would improve the debate. My wife and i... Settled — fairly, i think — on a home that's neater than i'd prefer to keep it, but less neat than she would. \" click for grose's full column or chait's response.",

In a phone interview, arlie hochschild, the author of the outsourced self and the foundational feminist text on women and housework, the second shift, makes the argument that a women's desire for a clean home has deeper origins than just marketing. Cleaning, hoschild says, is not simply physical work. It's emotional work. \"letting the house go is in a way letting something deeper go. … you get a sense of safety in an orderly home, \" hochschild says. But assuming both parties care about creating a sense of safety in the home, why does it fall to women? i suspect that women are more driven to keep a clean house because they know they — before their male partners — will be judged for having a dirty one.

            "Photo: roadside attractions jessica grose has an interesting piece for the new republic observing — and also decrying — that husbands may be catching up with childcare and even cooking, but still do way less housework than women. ( \"when it comes to housecleaning, \" she writes, \"my basically modern, egalitarian marriage starts looking more like the backdrop to an updike short story. \" ) grose casts around for explanations, but does not consider a possibility that probably explains a big part of the gap: women in general just have higher standards of cleanliness than men do. People who care a lot about neater homes spend more time cleaning them because that makes them happy. And while i agree in general that domestic life requires more gender equality, the housework problem has a partial solution that's simpler and more elegant: do less of it. Viewing housework inequality as entirely a phenomenon of exploitative men free-riding off of female domestic labor makes sense only if you think men derive equal enjoyment from a cleaner and neater home. If that were the case, men who lived by themselves, or with other men, would have to keep their own homes tidy until they could conscript a wife or girlfriend to do their cleaning.

Instead, iowa state university researchers who studied infrared light emitted by the star in the cygnus constellation believe that the likeliest explanation is the \" destruction of a family of comets, \" which caused dramatic changes in the light observed by the kepler telescope as the fragments and debris cloud moved past the star in a long, elliptical orbit. The team didn't actually look for alien structures, but they were able to use the infrared data to rule out possibilities including a massive collision nearby, the washington post reports. The seti institute has also investigated the star, and found no trace of the radio signals that would suggest extraterrestrial technology was present, cnn reports. But even without aliens, nothing like what is happening around kic 8462852 has ever been seen before and astronomers want to learn more. \" this is a very strange star, \" lead researcher massimo marengo said in a nasa press release. \" it reminds me of when we first discovered pulsars.

In a study published in nature neuroscience, scientists say these m1 and m3 clusters control cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and reasoning, per the daily express. \" traits such as intelligence are governed by large groups of [ genes ] working together — like a football team made up of players in different [ positions ], \" study co-author dr. Michael johnson says, per the guardian. By figuring out how these \" players \" work together, scientists could perhaps boost cognitive abilities by simply flicking the equivalent of a master switch. And based on other findings in the study linking mutations of those same genes to cognitive impairments, research in this area may be lead to treatment of cognitive issues that accompany neurodevelopmental diseases such as epilepsy, dr. Johnson notes, per the guardian. Researchers analyzed \" huge sets of data \" taken from samples of mouse and human brains, the paper notes, as well as info from a previous health study and genetic data from volunteers ( both healthy ones and those with autism and other intellectual disabilities ) who took iq tests. Not only did they find evidence for the disparate gene networks — they also found that the same genes that apparently contribute to the intelligence of healthy subjects damaged cognitive abilities if they were mutated. \" eventually we hope that this sort of analysis will provide new insights into better treatments for neurodevelopmental disease … and ameliorate or treat the cognitive impairments associated with these devastating diseases, \" johnson says. Not everyone is thrilled with the idea of flipping a switch to play around with intelligence functioning. \" genetics is the science of inheritance, not pre-determinism, and there is no substitute for hard work and application, \" a university of kent genetics professor tells the express.

Experts say that rather than being one disease, clinical depression is a collection of different disorders with one common symptom – that of low mood. Over the next five years, scientists will study individual groups of people who have known depression risk factors such as a family history of low mood, early life problems such as being born underweight or psychological trauma in childhood. Participants will asked to complete new questionnaires on their mental health and resilience. A subset will also be invited to attend a new clinic visit in aberdeen or edinburgh, which will include mri brain imaging.

Niels hoegel, 40, was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 for those crimes, but prosecutors voiced their belief that the nurse had killed many more while working at clinics in oldenburg ( from 1999 to 2002 ) and delmenhorst ( from 2003 to 2005 ), reports the ap. Now police are giving a sense of just how many more: at least 84. Hoegel said at trial that he wanted to play the hero and drugged his patients so that he could then resuscitate them and win praise. Except a commission established three years ago to determine the breadth of his crimes has found that many patients ended up receiving lethal doses of drugs that brought on heart failure or destroyed the circulatory system. The bbc reports that 134 bodies have been exhumed and tested for traces of the drug, but \" it is simply not possible to say how many people were killed, \" per oldenburg police chief johann kuhme. That's in part because many of his patients were cremated. The afp quotes chief police investigator arne schmidt as describing the death toll as \" unique in the history of the german republic. \" there is \" evidence for at least 90 murders, \" he said at a press conference, \" and at least as many [ suspected ] cases again that can no longer be proven. \" kuhme faulted the clinics for having \" hesitated to alert authorities, \" saying the death toll could have been much lower if they had. New charges against hoegel will likely be filed next year. ( this nurse says she would get a \" red surge \" before killing one of her patients. )",

Its findings: the president and his estate could save more than $ 1 billion. Experts commissioned by the times postulate the benefits would mostly come from the elimination of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. Under the current estate tax, trump's estate would take a 40 % hit following an assets transfer after his death. In what it called a potential \" bonanza \" for trump and his cabinet members, bloomberg last year estimated trump's family would save $ 564 million by dumping the estate tax; the times figures it closer to $ 1.1 billion, minus new york state taxes. Getting rid of the amt, which made up about 80 % of trump's income tax payment in the 2005 return, could save him more than $ 31 million.

We know the president understands he is putting democrats in a terrible spot. We know because he did nothing after the aurora, co shooting in the midst of a political campaign. He had to wait so he wouldn't spook voters. Now he will put the democrats on the line. Senators baucus, begich, hagan, johnson, landrieu, and pryor — all democrats from very pro-second amendment states who are up for re-election in 2014 — will be in jeopardy when, not if, the president overreaches. In all the talk that has happened and will happen, the press and the general public seem willing to ignore the actual purpose of the second amendment. The amendment is not about sports. It is not about recreation. It is not about hunting. It is only partly about defending yourself from a criminal.

More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \" geek index, \" reports the guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \" if you look at who does well in life right now, it's geeks, \" says magdalena janecka at king's college london. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal iq scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the bbc frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the uk. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32 % more likely to earn at least two a's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in translational psychiatry. They calculate that 57 % of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. \"our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those 'geeky'traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves, \" janecka tells newsweek. \" men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of 'geekiness.

Ms. Figueres, who described the trump administration's decision to withdraw as a \"vacuous political melodrama, \" said the american government was required to continue reporting its emissions to the united nations because a formal withdrawal would not take place for several years.

Figueres, the executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change until last year, said the bloomberg group's submission could be included in future reports the united nations compiled on the progress made by the signatories of the paris deal. There are 195 countries committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions as part of the 2015 agreement. Still, producing what mr.

But the toronto star reports that it could be months before forensic tests determine how the babies died and whether andrea giesbrecht was their mother. Employees of the u-haul facility opened the locker when giesbrecht stopped making payments, and a court appearance late last month might shed light on why she fell behind.

Then the 43-year-old austrian will ride a specially designed capsule into the stratosphere and take a leap over southeastern new mexico. The key for baumgartner is to jump head-first and reach maximum speed so as to avoid an uncontrolled flat spin — which could cause brain damage and possibly kill him, the daily mail reports. Within 40 seconds he hopes to reach 700mph, and hit the speed of sound at around 100,000 feet. Ultimately he intends to land near roswell.

( ap photo/ben margot ) ( associated press ) oakland, calif. ( ap ) — the golden state warriors somehow withstood lebron james ' latest brilliance on the nba finals stage. A costly blunder by j.r. Smith and a disputed foul call involving james himself sure helped. Stephen curry scored 29 points and the warriors capitalized on smith's mistake that sent the game into overtime, overcoming a 51-point performance by james to beat cleveland 124-114 in game 1 on thursday night. The game nearly over, james jawed with both curry and klay thompson, then tristan thompson and draymond green tangled moments later and made contact. After replay review, tristan thompson received a flagrant 2 foul and ejection with 2.6 seconds left.

An airport hobbled by only one suitable runway, a ruined port whose main pier splintered into the ocean, roads blocked by rubble, widespread fuel shortages and a lack of drivers to move the aid into the city are compounding the problems. About 1,700 people camped on the grass in front of the prime minister's office compound in the pétionville neighborhood, pleading for biscuits and water-purification tablets distributed by aid groups. A sign on one fallen building in nazon, one of many hillside communities destroyed by the quake, read: \"welcome u.s. Marines. We need help. Dead bodies inside! \" haitian officials said the bodies of tens of thousands of victims had already been recovered and that hundreds of thousands of people were living on the streets.

It's all part of the budget airline's blueprint to wrest trans-atlantic market share away from larger airlines such as lufthansa. Norwegian has 100 boeing 737 max jets on order, with the first five set to arrive in 2017, the telegraph notes. These planes are capable of flying over the ocean, but are more fuel-efficient and smaller, which would make them a better size for smaller airports like the one in birmingham, england. Regulators would have to agree to the plan and set up customs stations at those us airports that don't currently handle international flights, but kjos says he's sure that won't be an issue. A round-trip ticket will likely cost around $ 300 once all the fees are factored in, but that's still cheaper than the $ 500 or so that norwegian's flights in and out of busier airports run, nbc notes.

Experts say the lone star tick appears to be spreading from its home base in the southeastern us. Whereas other ticks can spread ailments such as lyme disease, the lone star tick is bothersome because it is believed to trigger a potentially life-threatening and apparently lifelong meat allergy with its bite. The tick doesn't technically make people allergic to meat, but rather to a sugar molecule found in red meat known as alpha-gal. This alpha-gal allergy has typically been limited to the southeastern us, where the lone star tick is prevalent, but no more, reports wired. Cases — in which the consumption of meat can result in hives, difficulty breathing, or death — have been reported in minnesota, new hampshire, pennsylvania, and new york, per inverse. Long island has seen at least 100 cases in the last year. Researchers suspect the spread of the allergy coincides with the spread of lone star ticks, though it's also possible that other ticks are responsible. Either way, \" the nuisance level [ for lone star ticks ] is much higher than the black-legged tick, \" an expert tells the weston forum. \" it is aggressive and very abundant. \" researchers are currently studying the effect of a lone star tick bite on mice to determine why it triggers the allergy.

            "It's any barbecue-lover's worst nightmare: you go to bed after enjoying a juicy burger or a smoky rack of ribs, only to awaken, covered in sweat and hives. You've become allergic to meat. An increasing number of meat lovers in the united states and around the world have had this horrific experience in recent years, and it's all because of a tiny parasite. The culprit, the lone star tick, spreads this potentially life-threatening allergy through its bites. Researchers don't know exactly how the tick spreads the allergy, but they have identified which component of meat causes the allergic reaction. Mammal meat — pork and beef — contains a sugar called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose ( alpha-gal for short ), and in people with the allergy, alpha-gal triggers an immune response that includes a massive release of histamines, much like your body would respond to other allergies. Wired reported that in 2004, university of virginia immunologist thomas platts-mills, ph.d., identified the alpha-gal connection after examining blood work from people that experienced strange reactions not to meat but to a cancer drug called cetuximab. People in the southeastern u.s., they found, were 10 times more likely to be allergic to this effective cancer drug. Further investigation showed that the region was also home to people with meat allergies. Since cetuximab and",

In the last decade and a half, thousands of previously protein-loving americans have developed a dangerous allergy to meat. And they all have one thing in common: the lone star tick. Red meat, you might be surprised to know, isn't totally sugar-free. It contains a few protein-linked saccharides, including one called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, or alpha-gal, for short. More and more people are learning this the hard way, when they suddenly develop a life-threatening allergy to that pesky sugar molecule after a tick bite. Yep, one bite from the lone star tick — which gets its name from the texas-shaped splash of white on its back — is enough to reprogram your immune system to forever reject even the smallest nibble of perfectly crisped bacon. For years, physicians and researchers only reported the allergy in places the lone star tick calls home, namely the southeastern united states. But recently it's started to spread. The newest hot spots? duluth, minnesota, hanover, new hampshire, and the eastern tip of long island, where at least 100 cases have been reported in the last year.

But the knicks center is never more passionate than when speaking out about his home country of turkey. And in recent years, as turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has amassed more and more power, kanter has emerged as one of erdogan's louder and more prominent critics. Kanter's decision to be vocal has come at a cost. Out of caution, he has not visited turkey in years, and in may he was detained for hours at an airport in romania after the turkish government canceled his travel documents. On wednesday, turkey's state-run news agency reported that prosecutors were seeking more than four years in jail for kanter on charges that he has insulted erdogan on twitter. It should be noted that kanter has 526,000 followers on twitter, giving him a sizable audience when he has something to say."

Gupta tried to clear things up yesterday on cnn, admitting he may have mixed details up during the chaos. \" there were many children, many people in the hospital, \" he said, per the guardian. \" when you report on these kinds of situations, you take lots of different bits of information and you consolidate it and in the end you tell the story. \" the neurosurgeon who performed the surgery on the older girl also tells the paper that gupta wasn't asked to help, as gupta claims, but that he harangued staff until they conceded; the surgeon also says he never gave permission for gupta's team to film the operation.

Meanwhile, the director of the gpi isn't buying gupta's \" things were so crazy \" excuse. \" a pretty grave mistake was made, \" she tells the guardian. \" the excuse that things were chaotic shouldn't hold up for any journalist, especially when that journalist is also performing a medical operation. \" cnn notes it's investigating, adding, \" journalism is not brain surgery.

            "Cnn has launched an investigation into claims that one of its star correspondents misled viewers in a report showing his emergency medical intervention on an earthquake victim in nepal. Dr sanjay gupta, an acclaimed neurosurgeon and the network's chief medical correspondent was reporting on the devastating 7.8 magnitude quake that killed more than 8,000 people in the poor south asian country in april, when he participated in an emergency operation on a victim. In both a report and interviews with cnn anchors, gupta said he had been involved in an intervention which had saved the life of an eight-year-old girl suffering from major head injuries. Gupta was shown inspecting scans of what were said to be the girl's skull prior to the surgery, and then in the operating theatre at the bir hospital, in central kathmandu. His actions, which came only two days after the tremor, were widely reported across the world. The girl was said to be suffering from a life-threatening blood clot in her brain. The accuracy of gupta's report has now been challenged in an investigation by the global press institute, an independent organisation that trains journalists in the developing world and publishes their reports. After speaking to doctors involved in the incident as well as patients and their families, the institute reported that gupta had actually helped with an operation on a different patient – a 14-year-old – and that the eight-year-old named in the report had not sustained any serious injuries. The institute also reported that cnn had published a text story before the video segment aired that correctly described the girls ' injuries.

Apple, as usual, isn't saying anything, but the mercury news talks to one industry observer who predicts that steve jobs would take a 30 % cut from subscriptions, plus 40 % from any ads generated by the newspaper apps. And remember this is all speculation, warns the columbia journalism review. Because of apple's obsession with security, we have to rely on thinly sourced stories like this one to get our fix of company news. \" and if you want my guess ( pure speculation — labeled as such! ) i'd say newspapers won't give steve jobs 30 % cut, \" writes ryan chittum. \" far be it from me to overestimate the business prowess and intelligence of newspaper executives, but surely they're not so dumb as to give him nearly a third of a recurring revenue stream. \" ( for more ipad doings, click here. )",

            "I've criticized press coverage of apple quite a bit. But i have to acknowledge something: the company's nsa-like secrecy makes it a bear to cover, and readers really want to read about apple ( me, too! ). Those factors don't excuse weak coverage, but they complicate providing good coverage. Today, as an example, we have this san jose mercury news story reporting that apple is about to launch a digital newspaper-subscription service. First, the sourcing is thin and unclear. There's nothing but the old passive-voice attribution in the lede: apple is expected to announce soon a new subscription plan for newspapers, which hope tablets like the ipad will eventually provide a new source of profits as media companies struggle with declining print circulation and advertising revenue. And the second paragraph makes us doubt the accuracy of the first, relying as it does on speculation ( at least as far as we know ) from an outsider. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Read this and understand why it's spla-ig vs. Spla-io. Adding to this web: a post at the conversation suggests that a third man, paul malong, might hold the real power in the country. Kenya's ambassador says the latest fighting was set off by a bogus facebook post by machar's spokesman saying machar had been arrested, even though the vp actually was in a security meeting with the president. The star of kenya explains. The spokesman, however, says he made the post after violence had started, fearing that a plot to detain or harm machar was underway. The us has ordered non-essential employees to evacuate, and several other countries were doing the same. The bbc has details. Few details were released on the new us troops, but they're from the us africa command's crisis response force, reports the marine corps times. They ' ll protect employees staying and help those leaving do so safely. In addition to reports of more than 200 people killed, the renewed fighting has displaced about 36,000 people, says the un.

Aid workers in the nation face huge problems, but a 28-year-old from san diego hasn't lost hope. See npr.",

Cops don't know most of the details, but they say it started with a dispute of some kind in one of the nearby hotels, then spilled into the street, reports the las vegas sun. When the range rover caught up to a maserati at a stop light, shots were fired from the suv that sent the maserati crashing into a taxi, which exploded upon impact. Three people — the maserati driver, the taxi driver, and a taxi passenger — were killed, and three others were injured, reports the la times. Police are hoping to piece together more details by interviewing a passenger in the maserati, who was injured in the melee. Earlier reports that gunfire came from both vehicles as part of a moving shootout were incorrect. The ap collects this quote from a tourist visiting from manchester, england: \" this doesn't happen where we come from, not on this scale. We get stabbings, and gang violence, but this is like something out of a movie. Like die hard or something. \"",

Seasonal allergies include symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, itchy eyes, runny nose and scratchy throat. Snyderman says most allergy sufferers can feel better by avoiding the allergens. She recommends that people run early in the morning when the dew keeps the pollen from releasing into the air, for example. \"most people can avoid the allergies by avoiding the problem, \" she said. \"[ a ] voiding a lot of outdoor activity when the pollen is stirred up in the air [ can help ]. \" here's a list of the top 10 cities — interestingly, all in the south — that are the worst offenders: 1. Louisville, ky. 2. Memphis, tenn. 3. Baton rouge",

While reporting on the epidemic of car break-ins in sanfrancisco, inside edition crew members watched as a man broke into a bait car fitted with hidden cameras. Reporter lisa guerrero began wednesday's report by parking a car near san francisco's alamo square with a designer purse and $ 250 speaker in full view. It wasn't long before a man smashed a rear window and grabbed the items, which had hidden gps trackers. The purse, thrown to a female companion who slipped away at a subway station, was eventually found in a trash can, but guerrero discovered the speaker still in the man's hand, reports the san francisco chronicle. \" five million people are gonna see you steal that, \" guerrero told him. When he dropped the speaker and walked away, guerrero went to interview a neighborhood resident whose surveillance camera captured the burglary, which he described as a daily occurrence. But guerrero returned to the crew's suv to find \" we actually got hit twice in one day. \" the same surveillance camera spotted thieves smashing two of the vehicle's windows and making off with \" thousands of dollars worth of equipment, \" guerrero said.

Jean johnson, grandmother of 31-year-old university of minnesota medical student ashley hasti, tells the star tribune that the couple married in 2011 and split up around a year later, but they didn't get a divorce because hasti couldn't afford one. Her body was found in her st. Paul home after cops at ucla found a note from sarkar asking them to \" check on my cat \" and giving his minnesota address. Police found her name on a list in sarkar's apartment and realized she could be in danger. Johnson says her granddaughter was a \" kind, beautiful, giggly girl \" and she doesn't know if there was any tension between her and sarkar. Lapd chief charlie beck says that sarkar drove from minnesota to los angeles and was probably in town for a \" couple of days \" before killing ucla professor william klug and shooting himself in klug's office, the los angeles times reports. The chief says sarkar's car hasn't been found yet and it's not known whether he committed other crimes between minnesota and california. Beck says investigators believe sarkar, who made online postings accusing former mentor klug of stealing his work, had planned to kill another ucla professor but couldn't find him. That professor \" is fine \" and was aware sarkar had issues with him, beck says. On thursday night, hundreds of students and faculty members gathered at ucla to mourn klug, known as a kind and dedicated professor who did his best to help students, including sarkar, the ap reports. \" bill was so much more than my soul mate, \" his wife, mary elise klug, said in a statement. \" i will miss him every day for the rest of my life. \"",

But in the wake of alleged poisoning and cyber-attacks, russia looms large. \" russia has embarked on a systematic effort to explore and exploit western vulnerabilities, particularly in some of the non-traditional areas of cyber, space, undersea warfare, \" he says. But he opposes any notion ( perhaps like french president emmanuel macron's ) that would weaken the military strength of nato. He says the \" center of gravity of european security \" should hold fast. \" in my experience, we should reinforce success. \" russian foreign minister sergei lavrov derided carleton-smith's remarks while visiting lisbon, radio free europe reports. \" we cannot influence the british government's decisions as to whom they trust to head its armed forces, \" says lavrov. \" i hope they check the appropriateness of such decisions. \" ( russian trolls apparently whipped up a frenzy over vaccines. )",
