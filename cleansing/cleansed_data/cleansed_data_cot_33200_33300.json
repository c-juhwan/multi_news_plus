        "summary": "Here's one tangible result from today's supreme court ruling that struck down a key part of the voting rights act: texas is going to require voters to have photo ids \" immediately, \" says state attorney general greg abbott. \"redistricting maps passed by the legislature may also take effect without approval from the federal government, \" he adds, according to dallasnews.com. Prior to today's court ruling, the state was one of nine that needed to clear such changes in advance with the feds. Not any more, or at least not until congress comes up with a modern formula to determine which states and localities need that kind of \" preclearance. \" the prospects of that happening in this congress? slim to none, reports the washington post. As a result, dmv offices in texas will begin issuing free photo ids to anyone who needs one — people without drivers ' licenses, for example — as of thursday. Without them, people won't be able to vote. The state passed its voter id law in 2011, but the obama administration blocked it from going into effect — citing the voting rights act — and it's been hung up in the courts ever since. In fact, an appeal is pending at the supreme court, but the state thinks it now has the right to move forward. ( the aclu concedes that the state has a \" very strong argument. \" ) critics say voter id laws in general discriminate against minorities and low-income voters. Now, it appears that the only legal challenges to them in texas and elsewhere will have to come after the fact, once they've been implemented, reports the new york times.",

        "summary": "He may not be as famous as tutankhamun, but ancient egypt's pharaoh senebkay may have experienced a death more fitting of a king. Woseribre senebkay, whose reign likely dates to roughly 1650bc, was savagely killed in battle, according to an analysis of his remains. That would make him the first egyptian pharaoh confirmed to have died in such a way, per egypt's ministry of antiquities, which reports the earliest pharaoh previously given this cause of death was seqenenre tao, who likely ruled a century later. In senebkay's case, 18 wounds that penetrated all the way to the bone tell the following tale: based on the direction and angle of the bone markings, archaeologist josef wegner tells discovery news senebkay was likely riding a horse or chariot when \" assailants first cut his lower back, ankles, and feet to bring him to the ground. \" blows to the skull followed, and those injuries \" show the distinctive size and curvature of battle axes, \" he adds. Interestingly, we have only been aware of senebkay's existence since last year, when a wegner-led expedition found his remains in a looted tomb; texts that remained declared that he was \" king of upper and lower egypt, woseribre, the son of re, senebkay. \" after piecing together his skeleton, the researchers initially thought senebkay lived into his mid- to late-40s; they've since amended that to between 35 and 40. Wegner says the pharaoh's body was mummified well after his death, indicating he died far from home. It's possible he was fighting northern egypt's hyksos kings. If that's determined to be the case, he would be \" the first warrior king who fought for liberation, \" a researcher tells the luxor times. ( just discovered in egypt: a mystery queen's tomb. )",

He survived, but he had a long, hard recovery and came out of the experience \" wanting to burn [ the world ] down … angry and bitter, \" as the free press describes his outlook. Music helped pull him out of his anger, and he decided after a brief career in the music industry to help other young people, performing and giving away his music for free.

Nancy holten was born in the netherlands but has lived in switzerland since she was 8; she'd like to gain swiss citizenship, which her children have, but despite meeting all legal requirements, her application was denied a second time in november. It seems the residents of gipf-oberfrick who had input on holten's application didn't want to give her what one local frames as the \" present \" of swiss citizenship \" if she annoys us and doesn't respect our traditions. \" among other things, the 42-year-old has campaigned against cowbells, which she says are too loud and heavy to be humanely draped on cows. She has also spoken out against hunting and racing piglets, reports the local. In some swiss municipalities, locals cast votes when a person applies for a passport, explains the independent. When she first applied in 2015, 144 out of 206 residents said no. A spokesman for the gipf-oberfrick administration says that voters didn't reject her application because she's against cowbells, but because she's against them so vocally. And some residents were apparently vocally against her, with holten telling swissinfo.ch that people began clapping when her denial was announced. She admits she's been \" too strident, \" but says she isn't \" attacking... Traditions \" and merely wants to look out for animal welfare. Holten has appealed the decision. ( a study actually determined what cows think of cowbells. )",

Bernie sanders is the only one of the candidates to have a favorable score, though 62 % of poll respondents didn't give an opinion on the senator because they didn't know much about him. Sanders is followed by marco rubio, barack obama, hillary clinton, martin o ' malley, rand paul, and scott walker. Walker fared only slightly better than voldemort, the noseless villain from harry potter, who in turn outranks mike huckabee, ted cruz, jeb bush, rick santorum, chris christie, and donald trump, in that order. Trump, who 71 % viewed unfavorably, scored a negative 56, far worse than christie's negative 26. A cnn poll last week found potential voters have the most unfavorable impression of clinton since 2001, with many doubting whether she is honest and trustworthy.

Lava flowing from fissures on the big island has expanded the coastline by some 700 acres, the equivalent of more than 500 football fields, reports cbs news. At least one new peninsula is believed to have formed near the town of kapoho in the last few days. Per the washington post, a tiny island roughly 20 feet by 30 feet materialized thursday, perhaps as a result of underwater pressure pushing a submarine lava flow to the surface. The land mass has since joined up with the rest of the big island, which \" continues to grow larger and larger every day, \" per hawaii news now. Though \" it may very well not survive long enough to support life, \" university of hawaii volcanologist michael garcia expects the expanded coastline to remain if the eruption continues for some time, per the post. Lava has now covered 12.5 square miles of the island and destroyed 706 homes, per cnn and cbs, and the threat continues. A \" collapse explosion event, \" which released energy equivalent to that of a 5.3 magnitude earthquake, that struck at kilauea's summit around 1: 45am wednesday was followed by an increase in lava flowing from the vent known as fissure 8. It \" produced a small overflow threatening homes on nohea street and additional overflows downstream on both sides of the channel, \" according to the us geological survey.",

            "When tiffany scanlon and megan marx signed up for the australian version of abc's hit dating show, \"the bachelor, \" they were hoping to find love with male model, richie strahan. What they found, however, was each other. \"i met tiffany in a very strange situation. Well... We were kind of dating the same guy, \" marx wrote in a post on instagram monday. \"from that first cocktail party, it was like this instant calibration between souls, as if we had known each other once before. Friendship ripened into something bolder, trust in a very strange situation was formed, and now every adventure we have rivals the other – and continues to make plans for itself. \" the instagram post confirmed what fans had been speculating about for weeks: marx, 27, and scanlon, 30, are more than just co-stars or friends. They are in a romantic relationship that both feel may stand the test of time. \"meeting megan this year felt like destiny, \" scanlon recently gushed in a post of her own. \"i know we will have many more adventures for many years to come. \" megan marx via instagram and marx took the occasion of scanlon's 30th birthday this week enthuse about the positive effect their relationship has had on her life: \"she is so confident in the ocean and in every adventure, as if every new experience is a winning of the lottery somehow; a chance to grow and learn and develop... She's helped me to disintegrate many of the ideals i've has that were harmful ( about relationships, about career and 'stability ' ) and for that i feel set free. \" one of 25 women vying for the same man's heart, tiffany scanlon departed the show in the third episode. And in a move that now seems quite telling, scanlon – who received the show's coveted \"first impression rose \" – actually volunteered to leave the show, crushing the man at its center",
            "Today @megan.leto.marx took me on a flight over the #abroholosislands for my 30th bday present! it was truly mind blowingly spectacular and with my favourite person in the world. This photo sums us up perfectly, me bossing megan to pose for a photo and her trying to ruin it but failing because she's too beautiful! meeting megan this year felt like destiny.

That changed in a big way on jan. 13, when he posted this series of tweets about his korean heritage and suddenly became twitter famous, reports yahoo news. Lee once worked as a staffer in the obama white house, and in one of the tweets, he explains that he visited the oval office on his last day in 2011, and obama greeted him by saying \" hello \" in korean. Official photographer pete souza captured lee's delighted reaction, and lee then recounts how fellow white house staffer ( and actor ) kal penn teared up when lee told him about the exchange. \" think about what you just said, \" he recalls penn saying. \" how incredible that is. On your last day of work at the white house, after your years of service, the first african-american president greeted you in your parents ' native language. I started crying too. \" lee, who was leaving the white house to go study in south korea, says his parents \" could never have fathomed \" such an encounter. Both worked multiple jobs and \" made incalculable sacrifices \" for their son, and he wraps up by declaring \" what a beautiful, incredible nation of immigrants we are. \" his tweets were set off by a report that president trump pressed a korean-american woman, a new york native, about where she was from during an intelligence briefing. \" that struck a chord with me, \" lee writes. Whatever the impetus, lee's initial twitter post has been liked more than 150,000 times, and the washington post rounds up some of the reaction, which generally boils down to a sentiment expressed in this tweet: \" omg i dont even know you and i love you gary lee. \" ( this teacher's viral tweet revealed how deep first-graders are. )",

Like many before, it was combative and vague and quite popular. \"so much fake news is being reported, \" trump wrote — perhaps referring to reports that he had complained of immigrants from \"shithole countries, \" or perhaps rebutting the previous night's nbc news report that he once called a career intelligence analyst a \"pretty korean lady. \" the 2,559th tweet did reasonably well, by trump's standards.

Syed rizwan farook and his wife, tashfeen malik, \" were equipped... And they could have done another attack, \" san bernardino police chief jarrod burguan said thursday. This after what the los angeles times calls a \" veritable armory \" was discovered at the couple's residence in redlands: 12 pipe bombs, 2,000 9 millimeter handgun rounds, 2,500.223 assault rifle rounds, and hundreds of tools that \" could be used to construct ieds or pipe bombs. \" and while motive remains unclear, unnamed law enforcement officials tell cnn that farook is believed to have been radicalized and in communication with people who were being looked at by the fbi. An unnamed source doesn't go quite that far in speaking with the lat, saying they're still trying to determine \" if the motive was something inspired by a terrorist organization or directed by a terrorist organization, or whether [ farook ] was self-radicalized, \" but that consensus is growing that a \"combination of terrorism and workplace \" motivation might be at play. More new details: farook reportedly met malik in 2013 while in saudi arabia. He was participating in the hajj, an annual pilgrimage that muslims are to take at least once. That trip raised no red flags, and neither of their names are on any fbi radicalization list. The two fired as many as 75 rifle rounds during the county health department holiday party, per cnn. They later fired about the same amount at police. In addition to the pipe bombs found in the home, three were found on the scene, bundled together. They did not detonate. The lat references court records related to 2006 divorce filings to paint a picture of a turbulent home life endured by farook. His mother described her husband as \" negligent and an alcoholic, \" and verbally and physically abusive, and cited instances where her children had to \" save \" her.",

Instead, he lived a full life that came to an end last thursday at age 91 due to kidney failure, reports the new jersey record. The last jewish survivor from the polish town of szadek, peck was liberated in 1945 before marrying another holocaust survivor and moving to new jersey, where he eventually bought an upholstery business. But he was frustrated \" that the american citizens he met did not have an inkling of the horrors which holocaust survivors had experienced at the hands of the nazis, \" author maya ross wrote in the recent biography abe-vs-adolf. \" the american jews didn't believe us... The way they killed us, the way they treated us. They didn't want to hear a word about it. It was too terrible for them to believe so we shut up. I shut up for years. \" that eventually ended, and to raise awareness, peck began speaking at schools and community functions. He was later invited to talk at colleges across the us and europe, according to his obituary. \" he felt if he survived, he could tell people about the horrors the nazis perpetrated, \" his son says. He wanted people \" not to stand for any injustice in the world. That was a core piece of his legacy. \" and though peck lost 83 of 89 family members in the holocaust, per the washington post — he said the day he watched his father die of pneumonia was the worst of his life — he managed to live a happy life. \" i made many good friends and they tell me that i am a nice guy! \" he said.

The ap observes that the squalid, muddy camp \" had begun taking on an image of semi-permanence, \" with falafel shops and other stores popping up.

The study also finds that after our teenage years, our tastes move away from the mainstream until we're about 30. Kalia explains this as a result of two factors: first, we're finding new, less radio-friendly material to listen to, and second, we're going back to the hits of our teenage years — which aren't so big anymore. One other intriguing finding: men's taste moves away from the mainstream more than women's.

Streaming music service spotify has identified 42 as the age when many of its users rediscover the joys of current pop music, as part of research into how their tastes mature over time. \"during the teenage years, we embrace music at the top of the charts more than at any other time in our lives. As we grow older, our taste in music diverges sharply from the mainstream up to age 25, and a bit less sharply after that, \" explained the company on its insights blog. \"we're starting to listen to 'our ' music, not 'the ' music.

Whether the demands of parenthood and careers mean devoting less time to pop culture, or just because they've succumbed to good old-fashioned taste freeze, music fans beyond a certain age seem to reach a point where their tastes have \"matured \".

The study, published in the american journal of public health, is the first one to break down problematic drinking by county, usa today notes; it scrutinized drinking patterns in adults 21 and over from 2002 to 2012, pointing out the locales that make the short list of binge-drinking hot spots. Wisconsin's menominee county is no. 1 on the list ( 36 % of adults there binge drink ), while madison county in idaho ( which boasts a large mormon population ) does the least guzzling, with a mere 5.9 % rate. Binge drinking, as defined by the cdc, is alcohol consumption that brings one's bac up to at least 0.08 % in one sitting — about five or more drinks for men in two hours or so, or four or more drinks for women. In 2012, 18.3 % of people in the us were considered binge drinkers, the press release notes. The study points out areas in new england, the west, and the midwest as having particularly high problem-drinking rates, though differences within individual states are wide-ranging as well — a fact that scientists say calls for more locally-focused alcohol programs. But it's women who are hitting the bottle harder than usual: the binge-drinking rate for females rose 17.5 % between 2005 and 2012, while the men's rate increased 4.9 %. Heavy drinking ( 15 or more drinks per week for men, eight or more for women ) is also experiencing rising rates, with nevada's esmeralda county taking the lead with a 22.4 % rate.

        "summary": "Some 52 feet below the surface of the baltic sea sits what the media is calling \" sweden's atlantis \" — though that is just a bit of an overstatement. While it's not a lost island, or even a lost village, it's a site that holds \" one-of-a-kind \" 11,000-year-old relics. Project head björn nilsson explains that what he and his fellow divers have found isn't an actual village, per se, because the stone age-era people who once used the found items were nomadic. But it could be \" maybe one of the oldest settlements from the first more permanent sites in scania and in sweden full stop, \" just a temporary one at that, he told the local last month. A press release from nilsson's södertörn university explains that between 11,000 to 9,000 years ago, the forested landscape would have slowly evolved into a lagoon and then part of the baltic sea, \" and all the tree and bone pieces are preserved in it, \" says nilsson. As the local reports, it's believed the items were discarded in the water ( discovery news terms the site \" some sort of dump \" ). And the preservation that followed, nilsson says, is \" world-class. \" what his team has uncovered so far during its planned three-year excavation effort at the bay at hanö: animal horns, tools, ropes, and a possible harpoon carved from bone. As for the incredible preservation of items like rope, the archaeologists have gyttja sediment to thank: it forms as peat starts to decay, and has resulted in low oxygen levels. ( previous dives in the area surfaced another remarkable find. )",

After authorities called rodriquez looking for the girl, she said he dropped her off an hour's walk from her house and told her to tell her parents she had been with a friend. He was later arrested, paid a $ 15,000 bond, and was released. ( in missouri, police say a man kept a teenage girl captive in his home for weeks. )",

Calling the nation's immigration laws a \" disgrace, \" trump at a tuesday rally in west virginia zeroed-in on tibbetts rather than comment on the conviction of former campaign manager paul manafort or the guilty plea by his former fixer, michael cohen, which both happened earlier that same day. \" you heard about today with the illegal alien coming in very sadly from mexico, \" he told the crowd at the charleston civic center. \" and you saw what happened to that incredible beautiful young woman. \" president donald trump speaks a rally at the charleston civic center on aug. 21, 2018 in charleston, west virginia. Spencer platt / getty images iowa's two republican senators, sens. Chuck grassley and joni ernst, meanwhile said in a joint statement: \" too many iowans have been lost at the hands of criminals who broke our immigration laws. We cannot allow these tragedies to continue. \" and former republican house speaker newt gingrich has declared on fox news that \" if mollie tibbetts is a household name by october, democrats will be in deep trouble \" come election day. Another fox news contributor, former gop congressman jason chaffetz, has declared that tibbetts'death would resonate with voters far more than the investigations into"

The ap reports horace roberts was released from prison oct. 3 and fully exonerated monday in the death of terry yvette cheek, the co-worker with whom he was having an affair. Her strangled body was found alongside a highway in riverside county, calif., in april 1998, next to what seemed like telltale clues: roberts'truck and a lorus wristwatch believed to be his. Prosecutors argued he had killed cheek after she threatened to put an end to their relationship and he was convicted of second-degree murder in 1999 and sentenced to 15 years to life. Now, prosecutors say dna evidence indicates cheek's husband, googie harris, and nephew were behind her murder — and that's not all. That \" classic murder case \" quote comes from justin brooks, director of the california innocence project, which has worked for 15 years to secure roberts ' freedom and believes harris purposefully left behind clues that would implicate roberts. \" i guess [ harris ] was getting the ultimate revenge, \" brooks tells the washington post. Roberts had lied about the affair when confronted by police, and prosecutors seized on that, even though he had an alibi for the night: he called cheek a number of times from a pay phone near his house when she didn't show up as she was supposed to. Dna tests performed on the watch and cheek's fingernails in 2013 and 2017 were key to roberts ' exoneration. Harris and joaquin leal are being held on $ 1 million bail. The press-enterprise reports roberts could seek restitution of roughly $ 1 million from the state. ( a man who never golfed was freed from prison thanks to the game. )",

He feels like a symbol, \" like a dolphin for save the ocean, \" says lucitante, but \" i ' m sure i ' ll never feel like i ' m doing enough. \" the cofán struggle with westerners goes back hundreds of years, when european diseases likely killed off thousands. Then, in the 1960s, oil companies began drilling in a cofán village, forcing a general retreat; deforestation, oil spills, and sickness followed, along with a lawsuit including the cofán as plaintiffs. The cofán protected a swath of land, but also persuaded an idealistic us college student to take 10-year-old lucitante to seattle and raise him. Adaptation to america was tough, but helping the cofán may be harder: lucitante, subject of the documentary oil &amp; water, wants them to have better schools, stronger homes, and a drone to monitor illegal mining and logging.

The update, however, is likely to make the law school's approach more similar to the university-wide policy adopted in july that lowers the burden of proof to a \" preponderance of evidence \" — an update that some harvard law faculty bemoan as lacking \" the most basic elements of fairness and due process, \" reports businessweek. The education department not only concluded that harvard's law school was not ensuring a fair and prompt review of sexual assault allegations, it also highlighted two cases in which the school did not \" appropriately \" respond to complaints of sexual assault, reports the washington post. In one instance, the complainant wasn't allowed to participate in the appeal process at all, and it took the school more than a year to make a decision, which it ultimately reversed. Harvard claims it has addressed some of these issues during the four-year investigation, including launching a task force to \" recommend ways to more effectively prevent gender-based discrimination. \" ( the education department recently found that two in five schools are ignoring sexual assaults altogether. )",

The baltimore sun and washington post report on probes now in the works after the city's public defender released the video last week, taped by the officer's own camera. In the footage, the officer, identified as richard pinheiro, is seen in the jan. 24 incident placing a soup can with a plastic bag in an alley. He then walks to the street, turns on his bodycam, and says, \" i ' m gonna check here. \" he walks back to the can; the plastic bag is shown to contain white capsules. The camera automatically tapes for 30 seconds, sans audio, before it's activated, which is what captured the alleged drug-planting; cnn notes a possible reference to those 30 seconds can be heard on the tape. Footage after that came when pinheiro flicked the camera on. Baltimore police commissioner kevin davis notes an investigation is ongoing and says there's more footage from the incident offering \" other perspectives. \" he also floats the possibility that pinheiro and two other cops seen in the video were \" re-creating \" their drug bust — which an aclu lawyer tells the sun would still be \" potentially criminal. \" an attorney for the public defender's office, who says bodycam footage is \" meaningless \" if officers can switch it on and off, is also upset that state prosecutors still called pinheiro as a witness in an unrelated case after the drug-planting allegations had been revealed; he's said to be a witness in more than 50 other active cases. Cops say one officer ( presumably pinheiro ) has been suspended and two others placed on administrative duties.

But a month ago, princess charlotte elizabeth diana hadn't yet entered the world, and now takasakiyama natural zoological garden is fielding a \" barrage of complaints \" about a public vote to also name its new macaque charlotte, the bbc reports. It's a tradition for the first macaque born each year at the oita zoo to have its name chosen by the public. Though voting took place over more than a month, a zoo official tells the afp that \" charlotte \" had zero votes before the princess's name was announced on monday. But between that name revelation and the discovery of the female macaque's birth on wednesday, \" charlotte \" jumped to the lead with 59 out of 853 votes, reports the kyodo news agency. Japanese citizens complained the name disrespects england's royal family and that their fellow japanese wouldn't like it if the brits named a monkey after a member of japanese royalty. This moniker madness could have been avoided if the zoo had simply chosen one of the other contenders that emerged during the vote, such as kei ( for well-known japanese tennis ace kei nishikori ) or elsa ( a tip of the hat to the frozen character ). The zoo now says it's stepping back to consider other names. \" we deeply apologize for causing trouble to many people over the naming of the first baby [ monkey ], \" a zoo statement said, per the ap. \" we take these opinions seriously. \" a zoo rep tells the ap he hasn't heard of any complaints from british citizens yet.

Robots patrolling more than 3,250 feet below the weddell sea have discovered underwater storms are helping thaw antarctic ice as they drive warm water toward polar ice shelves. Essentially, researchers knew warm waters were melting the ice but hadn't a clue how they were getting to it; warmer water is typically found far below the ocean's surface, reports the bbc. Now researchers have zeroed in on the storms, which are made mostly of cold water but carry trapped water from warmer latitudes at their center, the christian science monitor reports. Dolphin-like drones made 750 dives to sample water temperature, salinity, oxygen levels, and fluorescence over two months in 2012 to find the storms, or \" swirling eddies. \" but the storms are hard to predict. In fact, \" this is our first glimpse at just how variable these currents are, \" a researcher explains. \" unless you understand how the temperature of currents is changing from day to day... Then you can't understand what the long-term heat transport is. \" the team will set the robots loose on the drake passage in the coming weeks to learn more about the antarctic ice melt, the los angeles times reports.

The twitter tv ratings dig deep into the data to find out not just how many times a show was mentioned on the social media service, but also how many people saw those tweets, reports the new york times. For instance, one episode of grey's anatomy garnered 225,000 tweets, but they were potentially viewed by 2.8 million different twitter accounts. But perhaps the most notable thing about the ratings is that they show twitter chatter and tv viewer numbers aren't necessarily related. Of the top 10 tweeted-about shows for september 23 to 29, only one — the voice — made the top 10 for actual viewers. Football, the big bang theory, and ncis are what people were watching — yet shows like breaking bad, jimmy kimmel live, and dancing with the stars had more people talking, reports variety. \" if your show is creating conversations on twitter, it is more valuable, and you should get credit for that, \" says a twitter spokesperson, per the wall street journal.

File - in this aug. 19, 2015 file photo former subway restaurant spokesman jared fogle leaves the federal courthouse in indianapolis following a hearing on child-pornography charges. Ten victims of fogle,... ( associated press ) the $ 100,000 checks were hand-delivered to each of the 10 victims or their parents over the last several weeks, with each signing a form saying they had received the money and that it is intended to benefit that particular victim, assistant u.s. Attorney steven debrota told the associated press on thursday. Debrota said he's handled only one other case in which restitution was paid to victims before sentencing in nearly a quarter-century of prosecuting child porn cases. By the time a federal judge sentences fogle on nov. 19 to a minimum of five years in prison, debrota said prosecutors expect to have either presented $ 100,000 checks to fogle's four other victims or have plans in place to disburse those funds to them. That money will pay for mental health counseling, medical care and other needs the 14 victims might have now or in the future to help them recover from the trauma. Three adults and seven minors had received their checks as of thursday. Debrota said that money will help them \" go on with their lives and put them where they should have been had none of this happened. \" fogle agreed on aug. 19 to plead guilty to one count each of travelling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor and distribution and receipt of child pornography. Prosecutors have agreed not to seek a sentence of more than 12½ years in prison and fogle agreed not to ask for less than five years. Carol hepburn, a seattle attorney who has helped several child porn victims pursue restitution, said the vast majority of restitution orders in those cases are never fully paid.

            "Indianapolis ( ap ) — ten victims of former subway pitchman jared fogle have received a total of $ 1 million in restitution since he agreed to plead guilty to child pornography and sex-crime charges, and his four other victims could receive their checks by the time he is sentenced next month — a move prosecutors said is rare. File - in this aug. 19, 2015 file photo former subway restaurant spokesman jared fogle leaves the federal courthouse in indianapolis following a hearing on child-pornography charges. Ten victims of fogle,... ( associated press ) the $ 100,000 checks were hand-delivered to each of the 10 victims or their parents over the last several weeks, with each signing a form saying they had received the money and that it is intended to benefit that particular victim, assistant u.s. Attorney steven debrota told the associated press on thursday. Debrota said he's handled only one other case in which restitution was paid to victims before sentencing in nearly a quarter-century of prosecuting child porn cases. By the time a federal judge sentences fogle on nov. 19 to a minimum of five years in prison, debrota said prosecutors expect to have either presented $ 100,000 checks to fogle's four other victims or have plans in place to disburse those funds to them. That money will pay for mental health counseling, medical care and other needs the 14 victims might have now or in the future to help them recover from the trauma. Three adults and seven minors had received their checks as of thursday. Debrota said that money will help them \" go on with their lives and put them where they should have been had none of this happened. \" fogle agreed on aug. 19 to plead guilty to one count each of travelling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor and distribution and receipt of child pornography. Prosecutors have agreed not to seek a sentence of more than 12½ years in prison and fogle agreed not to ask for less than five years. Carol hepburn, a seattle attorney who has helped several child porn victims pursue restitution, said the vast majority of restitution orders in those cases are never fully paid. She said she hopes the disgraced spokesman's wealth and quick restitution to his victims will have no impact on the length of his sentence. \" i would hope that justice is equal for those who have money as well",

Washington/austin president barack obama will meet texas governor rick perry on wednesday to discuss a surge of latin american young people crossing the u.s.-mexico border that has put the two leaders at odds with each other. Perry's office welcomed the meeting, to take place in dallas on the governor's turf, in a tuesday statement that said they would discuss the humanitarian and national security crises along the southern border. More than 52,000 unaccompanied minors from guatemala, el salvador and honduras have been caught trying to sneak over the u.s.-mexico border since october, double the number from the same period the year before. Many are fleeing extreme poverty, gangs and drug violence, as well as responding to rumors spread by smugglers that children who reach the u.s. Border will be allowed to stay. On sunday the governor sharply criticized the obama administration for not moving more quickly to address the problem. \" they either are inept or don't care, \" he told abc news. Perry has called for national guard troops to be sent to the border to help stem a surge of central american nationals entering the united states illegally. On monday, white house aide valerie jarrett wrote to invite perry to take part in a session to discuss the border situation with local faith leaders and elected officials in dallas on wednesday.

Obama asked congress on tuesday for $ 3.7 billion to deal with the border crisis.

        "summary": "Three kurdish women were found dead at a paris pro-kurdish center early today, and france's interior minister is calling it an execution. The three activists were shot; local media reported they were shot in the head, but police would not confirm that, the ap reports. One of the victims is sakine cansiz, a co-founder of militant separatist group kurdistan workers party or pkk. The other two victims are fidan dogan, who worked in the kurdish institute information center and was a kurdistan national congress representative, and activist leyla soylemez. The three were last seen inside the building yesterday afternoon; police forced their way inside after a member of the kurdish community found the doors locked, the bbc reports. \" there is no doubt this was politically motivated, \" another employee of the institute says, according to reuters. Turkey and the pkk have been in conflict since 1984, as the pkk demands autonomy for kurds in turkey, but talks recently started between turkey and imprisoned pkk leader abdullah ocalan. A turkish official says the murders appeared to be the result of \" an internal feud \" within the militant group.",

The bodies of sakine cansiz and two others were found on thursday. France and turkey both condemned the killings. The motive for the shootings is unclear. Some 40,000 people have died in the 25-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk. However, turkey has recently begun talks with the jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan, with the aim of persuading the group to disarm.

There has been a tacit agreement between the pkk and the turkish government that no such high-profile attacks would be carried out against either senior pkk members or senior members of the government. During the 1980s, there were some attacks believed to be from within the turkish state against members of the militant armenian group asala, but there have been no political assassinations targeting the pkk.

The simple fix: scientists left cotton balls laced with a mild pesticide for the birds to take, and the finches happily wove them into their nests. Result: nineteen of 20 nests with the cotton balls were free of the blood-sucking parasite, which has been blamed for declining finch populations of late, reports university herald. The pesticide is permethrin, which reuters explains is mild enough to treat head lice in humans. It has no effect on the birds or their offpsring, but it kills the larvae of the parasitic flies known as philornis downsi. \" this parasite is not historically found in the galapagos islands and, therefore, darwin's finches have not had enough time to evolve defenses against the parasites, \" says one of the researchers. One of his colleagues struck upon the idea when she saw the birds stealing bits of a laundry line for their nests. ( read about another pacific island discovery involving a 63-year-old bird. )",

            "The late-night host received the news just before going on air tuesday. Kellyanne conway found herself in the hot seat on late-night tv on tuesday. Late night's seth meyers interviewed conway tonight, just after news broke that intelligence officials briefed donald trump and president barack obama about allegations that russia has \" compromising \" information about the president-elect. Conway told the host that \" nobody has sourced it \" yet, which was her concern, and that the fbi still is confirming the reports. According to those reports, top intelligence officials told trump and obama about an unsubstantiated report claiming russia had compromising personal and financial information about trump. The report's most graphic allegation details how, in moscow, trump supposedly witnessed prostitutes perform \" golden showers \" for him at the ritz-carlton hotel, on a bed where obama and his wife had stayed during one of their trips to russia. \" as an american citizen, \" added conway, \" we should be concerned that intelligence officials leaked [ this report ] to the press, \" but meyers reminded her that the press was reporting about trump being briefed on the issue.

        "summary": "The trump white house thinks the previous administration went overboard on rules about greenhouse gases, and it's about to make its third big move to correct that. After earlier moves on carbon dioxide pollution from autos and coal plants, this time it's all about methane, reports the new york times. The epa is expected this week to unveil its proposal to weaken rules on how companies track and repair methane leaks, giving them more time to do both, reports the wall street journal. Separately, the interior department is poised to roll back a restriction on the venting of methane at drilling sites. Environmentalists say the upshot will be that more heat-trapping methane will be released into the atmosphere, while industry leaders say it's needed relief from unnecessary red tape. \" it all depends on who you trust, \" kathleen sgamma, president of the western energy alliance, tells the times. The obama \" administration trusted environmentalists. This one trusts industry. \" a former member of that obama administration has a different view: \" they're taking them down, one by one, \" says former epa official janet mccabe, referring to the obama-era rules on climate change. The hill reports that the two biggest sources of methane emissions are natural gas drilling and the raising of livestock. It notes that over the summer, the epa exempted farmers from a rule requiring that they report methane emissions from cattle. ( maybe seaweed can help with the latter? )",

            "The trump administration is poised to roll back existing regulations on methane gas as early as this week, the new york times reported monday. The proposal would weaken an obama-era requirement that companies must monitor and repair any methane leaks, according to documents the times reviewed. The new rule is anticipated to allow for far more air pollution and leaks of the gas. The proposed rule would be the third major step the environmental protection agency ( epa ) has made this year to change the way air pollutants are regulated. Advertisement since january, the agency has taken strides to roll back two capstone obama-era rules that aimed to regulate tailpipe emissions from cars and carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. While methane only makes up about 10 percent of greenhouse gases, according to the epa, the methane rule was key to the obama administration's push to lessen the impacts of climate change. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, can be a dangerous fume. The two largest contributors of methane are leaks from natural gas systems and the raising of livestock. In july, the epa signed off on another rule exempting farmers from reporting methane emissions from cattle. The rule came from just-passed legislation that exempted farmers from having to report emissions derived from animal waste and other pollutants. The interior department's bureau of land management announced in february that it too would be looking to replace a regulation from former president obama that would limit the amount of methane allowed to be emitted into the air through drilling. The byproduct typically occurred due to venting or burning off the fuel. The times said the final version of the rule is expected to be released in coming days.",

        "summary": "Cue the locusts: some 30 million of the insects descended on egypt over the weekend, in a development that had the country's agricultural ministry scrambling to deploy insecticide-spraying helicopters to contain the outbreak. The main swarm appears to be centered around giza, near southern cairo, where ynet reports that many residents were burning car tires to ward off the pests. Meanwhile, the times of israel reports that egypt's ag minister was pleading with residents to let authorities deal with the infestation: \" the armed forces and the egyptian border units are trying to battle the swarm, \" he said. \" i ask the families living in the area afflicted with the swarm to not light car tires. It doesn't drive the locusts away, it only causes damage. \" the locusts have neighboring israel on alert, notes the ap, adding that its agricultural ministry today set up an emergency hotline and is asking israelis to use it to report sightings. Today, however, the egyptian government is claiming that it has eradicated up to 95 % of the locusts around cairo, reports the egypt independent, though it acknowledged it's still investigating reports elsewhere. A cairo professor noted that the un told the country about the coming swarm in november, but its warnings were brushed off.",

        "summary": "You'd think our pumpkin latte obsession would have to be pretty bad to warrant a study on their sales, but it turns out most of us like a taste only about once every season. Market research firm npd group reviewed fall and winter receipts from some 35,000 diners last year to find 72 % of people who indulged in a pumpkin latte did so only once; 20 % bought two, while 8 % bought three or more, reports the chicago tribune. You might be surprised given that pumpkin flavor appears in everything from yogurt to beer and at places like dunkin'donuts and mcdonald's. But it turns out the real perk to having a pumpkin drink on the menu is that it brings in new customers who keep coming back. Still, it doesn't hurt that those who do buy the limited-edition drink spend more than those who avoid it: pumpkin latte buyers paid out $ 7.81 on average, compared to $ 6.67 for other consumers. People who bought another seasonal beverage, the white mocha, spent even more: $ 8.37 on average as opposed to $ 6.84 for buyers who purchased something else. The higher tallies tended to involve food purchases, notes npd group. \" we do see more chains trying to drive visits with these special limited-time offers, \" says warren solochek of npd group. \" it gives chains a chance to talk about themselves. \" while the study focused on beverages, solochek notes seasonal food items, like the mcrib at mcdonald's, likely enjoy similar success. While the short offer period limits how many times consumers will actually get a taste, \" one thing the mcrib does is generate a ton of positive press for mcdonald's, \" he says. \" it's one of those promotions that mcdonald's does really well. \" ( until recently, starbucks ' pumpkin latte didn't include real pumpkin. )",

            "Chicago, september 22, 2015 — it's that time a year again for falling leaves, football games, and the annual tradition of limited-time offer ( lto ) pumpkin specialty drinks. Turns out that it's one of the favorite times of the year for foodservice operators who offer the limited time drinks because their business benefits in more ways than one, reports the npd group, a leading global information company. The seasonal beverage offers can spur additional purchases by established customers, bring in new customers, draw customers from competitors, and stimulate business during slow periods, according to research from npd's checkout tracking™, which harvests receipts from more than 35,000 diners to track consumer purchase behavior. An analysis of the purchase cycle of pumpkin spice latte buyers reveals that these lattes are likely considered to be an \"indulgent�? purchase, and the vast majority of these purchasers, 72 percent, did so just once. About 20 percent of pumpkin spice latte customers purchased the item twice, and about 8 percent made three or more purchases during the offer period. In addition to increasing visits and visit frequency, seasonal beverages also produce higher checks, npd found. During fall and winter 2014, the average check for pumpkin latte buyers was $ 7.81, compared with $ 6.67 for non-buyers. Similarly, the average check for buyers of a white mocha, another popular seasonal beverage, was $ 8.37, compared with just $ 6.84 for non-buyers. Consumers ' purchase of food items in addition to the beverage contributed to the higher check average, according to the checkout tracking analysis. To determine the impact of limited-time offers on visit frequency, npd also examined the purchase cycle of a seasonal shake offer at another major chain. The data revealed that these shake purchasers tended to be the restaurant's most loyal customers, with higher purchase frequency rates, especially during the promotional period. Shake buyers made 5.7 visits in the two-month period before the limited-time offer, and then made an additional visit during the limited-time offer period. Meanwhile non-shake buyers made only 4.7 visits prior to the promotion and 4.4 visits during the limited-time offer. \"considering the battle for traffic share in the restaurant industry, it's critical to offer unique, craveable menu items that attract both new customers and keep current ones"
