        "summary": "Your instagram account may know you're depressed before you do, according to a new study out of harvard and the university of vermont. The daily dot reports researchers taught a computer to analyze aspects of instagram photos, such as colors, brightness, and faces, then set in to analyzing nearly 44,000 posts from 166 people. The instagram users in the study took a clinical depression survey and were asked about any history of depression, according to fortune. Cnn reports the computer program was able to correctly detect depression from a person's instagram account 70 % of the time. That's better than humans looking at instagram photos and better than the success rate of general practitioners diagnosing depression. Researchers found the instagram posts of depressed people tended to be less saturated, darker, and more blue. Depressed people tended to use the inkwell filter most often ( non-depressed people preferred valencia ) and got more comments on their posts ( non-depressed people got more likes ). Depressed people also posted more photos of faces but had fewer faces per photo. Because the computer program was able to detect depression in instagram users before the were even diagnosed with it, researchers believe it could be a new way to screen people for depression before they start showing more serious symptoms and get them help earlier. ( this party drug may soon treat depression. )",

A clark county prosecutor — who plans to have howell extradited back to indiana — tells the ap that howell and the girl's brother are members of the same car club and that the girl attended a car event with howell. Afterward, howell offered to drive the girl to the home of a family friend but first stopped at a forested area, where howell molested her, the prosecutor says. The girl's mom went to police two days later and howell was interviewed on june 7. Police say he admitted to fleeing indiana \" due to his concerns over existing or pending criminal charges \" after he was found early sunday with a loaded assault rifle, taser, hood, magazines, handcuffs, and 15 pounds of explosive chemicals that \" posed a grave danger to both persons and property, \" per the los angeles times. He faces up to 16 years if convicted of child molestation, and more than nine years if convicted of felony weapons charges, including possession of explosives on a highway, possession of an assault weapon, and possession of high-capacity magazines. Howell — who friends describe as a gun enthusiast — was convicted of misdemeanor intimidation in april after allegedly pulling a gun on a neighbor and wasn't allowed to have weapons or leave indiana.

Authorities say sandusky, a former state prison guard who knew the girls through dating their mother, tried to persuade them that what he was doing was normal, saying \" it's not weird because he studied medicine, \" but asking them not to show his messages to anybody. Sandusky, like his mother, dottie, loyally supported his father through his trial for the sexual abuse of 10 boys, the times notes.

Wyatt, who previously called cosby's trial a \" public lynching, \" accused judge steven o ' neill of being part of a \" sex war \" and linked the sentencing to the treatment of supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh.

Cooking food yourself is typically cheaper, so why the exception here? mcardle cites a post at kcet that explains what's going on: supermarkets use chickens that are about to hit their sell-by expiration date for those rotisseries. In fact, they do it not just with chicken but with many of the offerings in the prepared-food department. Underhanded? no, writes mcardle. It's actually kind of brilliant. Instead of taking a loss on the still-fine food, the stores cook it up and serve it hot. \" this is the sort of thing that no one talks about when they talk about innovation — and yet, it's a major way in which our economy has become more efficient over the last few decades, \" she writes.

Seventy-six-year-old farmer vernon hugh bowman has lost his supreme court battle with monsanto over his use of patented soybean seeds, the new york times reports. The court upheld an $ 84,000 lawsuit brought against bowman by the agribusiness giant for growing and saving its seeds without paying a fee. Bowman had obtained the seeds from a grain elevator intended for animal feed, and argued that a doctrine called \" patent exhaustion \" allowed him to do as he pleased with the grain once he had purchased it. This may be true if he wanted to eat the seeds, but justice elena kagan ruled that it does not extend to growing more seeds and replanting them without paying monsanto for their use. But this case was about more than a few soybeans. Other industries with self-replicating products — from biotechnology to software — were paying close attention to see if their patents would remain safe, usa today reports. But kagan warned the outcome of this one case did not necessarily assure their futures. \" our holding today is limited, \" she wrote. \" we recognize that such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent, complex, and diverse. In another case, the article's self-replication might occur outside the purchaser's control. Or it might be a necessary but incidental step in using the item for another purpose. \"",

For non-angelenos: this is a big deal, hence the nicknames \" carmageddon \" and \" carpocalypse. \" some of the most amusing developments: some businesses are offering discounts to woo customers tempted to stay home, the wall street journal reports. A pet photog who makes house calls will give you 20 % off with her \" 4-0-fido \" deal. A tattoo shop on a sure-to-be-clogged thoroughfare is offering 15 % off. One restaurant will serve a $ 40.05 four-course meal; a bar is offering $ 5 irish car bombs and cadillac margaritas. Jetblue ran a \" fly over the 405 \" special — $ 4 one-way tickets between burbank and long beach, a 40-mile, 20-minute trip. That sold out in less than four hours, the los angeles times notes, but you can still snag a $ 150 luxury helicopter ride over the traffic snarl, the wsj adds. Best tweet? @latimestot quotes jay leno: \" 2 days til carmageddon closes the 405 freeway &amp; u wont be able to go anywhere. As opposed to when the 405 is open &amp; u cant go anywhere. \" in truth, the los angeles times notes, the 405 has been under construction for centuries, and it traces its evolution dating back to a spanish explorer who rode through in 1769. Is there mayhem in the works? the la weekly seems to think so. One \" after-hours bicycle mob \" may be planning a \" 4pacolypse \" ride on the empty freeway, while officials are also worried about skateboarders. And one group says it's filming a \" top secret \" flash mob publicity stunt. That's not all: watch two of the best viral videos, in the gallery.",

Thousands marched toward the nyse shortly after 7: 30am in an attempt to block it on the movement's two-month anniversary. Protesters chanted \" get your corporate id out. This is a police state \" and \" god bless america \" at wall street workers as they passed through police checkpoints, notes dnainfo. Though some workers had difficulty getting in, the stock exchange opened at 9: 30am per usual; protesters rang a \" people's bell \" outside. Later in the day, protesters plan to head to subway stations to \"listen to a singular story from one of our hardest-hit and most inspirational neighbors, \" fliers for the event say. Next, it's a march to manhattan's foley square, where a protest is backed by major unions; then on to local bridges to \"demand that we get back to work rebuilding our country's infrastructure. \" officials say they expect \"tens of thousands \" of protesters.

Attorneys for the convicted gunman, daniel green, say the original trial was rife with problems that only now are coming to light, the charlotte observer reports. To recap, green and larry demery were teenagers when they were tried for murdering 56-year-old james jordan — whose son was an all-time great nba player — during a 1993 carjacking in south carolina. In the high-profile trial, demery became a witness for the state and accused green of pulling the trigger. With physical evidence apparently supporting demery, both were found guilty and eligible for parole in 20 years, but green got an added 10 years for conspiracy. Now demery is up for parole consideration, and green's attorneys are claiming that: the trial's jury forewoman broke the rules by conducting her own investigation of the murder. Other jurors may have violated orders by reading or seeing accounts of the case. A state forensics expert admits that her testimony about blood in the car ( which supported demery's version of events ) was shaky, and she destroyed the only existing blood sample from james jordan on a supervisor's orders. The editor of a local native american newspaper said that during a jail interview, demery admitted to pulling the trigger. The first person the killers called from james ' car phone was a cocaine dealer who happened to be robeson county sheriff hubert stone's out-of-wedlock son, but the jury wasn't allowed to hear about the sheriff's connection. Details about that could undermine \" the entire jordan investigation, \" the attorneys say. A judge is likely to rule on the attorneys'request sometime after the end of april, says bleacher report.",

        "summary": "There's a whiff of desperation in the air over tonight's vice presidential debate — and a hint of controversy, too. The desperation, of course, comes from the blue team, which is desperate to halt the momentum mitt romney gained in the first debate, and expects joe biden to be especially aggressive in attacking paul ryan. The controversy? a conservative site has dug up evidence that president obama may have attended moderator martha raddatz's wedding. Here's what you need to know: the daily caller has found that obama had attended the first of raddatz's three weddings, back in 1991 — he was a harvard law classmate of groom julius genachowski, who he later named to head the fcc. But the la times is not impressed, writing snarkily that \" most of us in the political press have become far too complacent to backtrack even one wedding into the past of the debate moderators. \" everyone is expecting biden to come out swinging. One biden staffer tells politico that the vp is \" eager to draw the contrast — and very capable of doing so. \" ryan himself told a radio station yesterday that he expects biden to come at him like a \" cannonball, \" according to usa today. Expect biden to go on the attack when it comes to ryan's medicare plan in particular. Cnn also wonders if biden will bring up social security. Ryan has advocated moving the funds into private investment accounts, an idea democrats usually attack profitably — but obama appeared to take it off the table in the first debate, saying he suspected he and romney had \" a somewhat similar position. \" ryan's team also expects biden to bring up romney's 47 % gaffe, and they tell the wall street journal that they've specifically been prepping a response to it. On ryan's end, everyone's wondering just how wonkish he ' ll be. Cnn worries he ' ll get \" bogged down in arithmetic, \" but politico suspects it could be his \" greatest asset, a rope-a-dope tactic that will take voters into the policy weeds. \" of course, all this sound and fury might not signify much. \" by tradition, the vice presidential debates have been like the vice presidency itself: well-publicized but largely inconsequential, \" quips the washington post, noting that gallup studies found they'd never had a significant impact on the race.",

Two sisters, denise and micheline lévy, aged 10 and 9, clutched dolls — one pink, one blue — as they were led away to auschwitz. A gendarme grabbed the dolls and flung them to the ground, le parisien reports, via the telegraph. A shopkeeper picked them up and gave them to the grandmother of frédérique gilles, a 38-year-old schoolteacher, who has now donated them to the shoah memorial, the holocaust museum in paris. The dolls were among 200 items put on display sunday, out of 19,000 objects collected by volunteers. In many cases like the lévy sisters, they are all that remain of the deported. For two generations, gilles ' family minded the dolls. \" but nobody ever played with them, \" she told the paper. \" we knew their history. \" they tried to find out what happened to the lévy sisters, but turned up no clues. Gilles said it seemed wrong to keep the dolls. \" we wanted to give them to a museum, or a place of memorial. \" it was difficult to let them go, she added, \" but it was the best thing we could do for the memory of those little girls. \" over the past two years, volunteers for the shoah memorial criss-crossed france collecting a trove of objects belonging to those deported, including photos, a jersey emblazoned with a star of david, a violin case, and fading slips of paper noting the jews in hiding stacked in a little red box, reports telerama. \" some preferred that we borrow the objects … so they could pass them on to their children, \" shoah curator lior lalieu-smadja told telerama. \" we understand their choice but, unfortunately, we know that quite often this evidence will be lost. \"",

Sources say the show pressured the armstrongs to live beyond their means — they were actually millions in debt and being sued by investors — and also pressured them to ramp up the drama in their relationship. Radar reports that armstrong told a friend, days before his death, that reality tv had ruined his \" entire life. \" but armstrong's ex-wife blames estranged wife taylor, from whom armstrong was getting divorced. \" she's bad news and she drove him into this, \" the ex tells radar. \" i don't think it was the show.

        "summary": "Here's something else not to like about lice, mosquitoes, and fleas. An insecticide used to kill them — pyrethroids — might be linked to behavior issues in children as young as 6, a french study suggests. The researchers, noting the effects the chemical had on the nervous systems of insects, wondered how it affected humans, notably children. They tested the urine of about 300 pregnant women and, six years later, their children, according to the study published in occupational &amp; environmental medicine. Children with the highest levels of pyrethroids in their urine were three times more likely to have behavioral problems than kids with lower levels. The problems might be external ( kids being defiant or disruptive ) or internal ( a reluctance to ask for help ) depending on the specific type of pyrethroid they were exposed to, the study said. \" the pesticide class studied are considered'safe ' pesticides and this study is cause for concern as to how safe it really is, \" says a child psychatrist at lenox hill hospital in new york city who reviewed the findings, per healthday news. But he cautions that the study finds only a correlation, not cause and effect. Along those lines, a doctor at johns hopkins characterizes the study as preliminary and says it should be followed up by further research, reports yahoo. Still, a pediatric behaviorialist not involved with the research recommended that pregnant women use \" common sense \" when using insecticides and look for products that don't contain pyrethroids.

            "A disturbing new study has linked a common chemical found in head lice treatments to behavioral difficulties in children. The research, which was published in the journal occupational &amp; environmental medicine, found that children who had higher levels of certain pyrethroids — which are synthetic chemicals used in insecticides like head lice treatments and some mosquito repellents — in their system were more likely to display abnormal behaviors at age 6 than those who didn't. Pyrethroids work by damaging the nerves of insects, killing them in the process, and scientists wanted to see if they had a negative impact on children as well. ( permethrin, an active ingredient in the most popular drugstore lice treatments, is a pyrethroid. ) for the study, the researchers measured levels of five pyrethroid metabolites in the urine of women in the early stages of pregnancy and, later, in their 6-year-olds to see if there was a link between being exposed to the chemical in utero and childhood, and behavior that could suggest neurodevelopmental damage. Nearly 300 women filled out a questionnaire about socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, their child's behavior, and various things their child had been exposed to. Psychologists visited the families at home to do behavioral assessments of the children, and also took urine and dust samples. Behavior was rated using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire, a validated behavioral screening test for children, with a focus on altruism ( how social children are ), internalizing disorders ( the inability to share problems and ask for help ), and externalizing disorders ( being defiant and disruptive ). Three of the pyrethroid metabolites showed up most often in the urine of mothers and their children: trans-dcca, cis-dbca, and cis-dcca. Here's what researchers determined: mothers with higher levels of cis-dcca in their urine during pregnancy were more likely to have children with a higher risk of internalizing behaviors. Higher levels of another metabolite, 3-pba, in the children's urine was linked with a higher risk of externalizing behaviors. Overall, children with the highest levels"

Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at eureka alert.

Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of mrsa, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes medical daily. \" we already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive, \" says lead author laura crotty alexander of uc san diego. It's a double-whammy: smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

Snyder lays blame on the michigan department of environmental quality, which told residents the water was safe to drink, though some homes showed toxic lead levels. The department admitted it didn't get the necessary chemicals to treat the corrosive water. Residents have now filed three lawsuits at the federal, state, and municipal levels.",

Investigators say jessica kumala, 27, arrived early at a cafe in central jakarta and ordered an iced coffee for friend wayan mirna salihin, 27 — who soon showed up to join kumala and a friend. Mirna apparently took a sip, complained it tasted bad, fell over convulsing, and later died at a hospital. \" jessica's statement is highly inconsistent with the facts we have gathered, \" says chief detective krishna murti. He added that police have assembled 20 witness statements and re-enacted the crime. \" we can ignore the suspect's testimony in this case according to the criminal code, \" he tells the jakarta post. But kumala reiterated her innocence this week after being grilled by police for the fifth time, the jakarta globe reports. \" i do not know where the cyanide came from, \" she says. \" i just want to help police and mirna's family reveal who was behind all of this. \" her uncle and lawyer, yudi wibowo, says his niece is innocent and doubts mirna died from cyanide poisoning. He adds that mirna tasted the coffee herself, something kumala denies: \" i suffer from a stomach disorder and the coffee is too strong, thus i did not taste it, \" she says. Wibowo also denied rumors that his niece was having an affair with mirna's new husband. Mirna and kumala had studied together in australia, apparently at a college of design in sydney.",

Breitbart told nbc tuesday that if weiner wants to open himself to further investigation, \" there are a lot of women \" who could come forward. Asked directly if he considered the purported unpublicized picture an insurance policy, breitbart replied, \" i don't like to think of it that way. \" ___ online: http://apne.ws/mcwgly",

            "What we can only assume is the worst couple of weeks in rep. Anthony weiner's life continues. Andrew breitbart appeared on the opie and anthony show on sirius radio this morning in the latest stop on his \"i told you so \" tour and showed the hosts, anthony cumia and gregg \"opie \" hughes a picture that he said he wouldn't release; a fully uncensored photo that purports to be of weiner's genitals. Breitbart showed the picture on his cell phone which he passed around. Unsurprisingly, the hosts quickly snapped a shot of the screen and tweeted the image out to numerous news outlets. So, yeah, the picture's out there now. It will be interesting to see how much this picture affects the story. After all, everyone's basically already seen weiner's penis albeit covered by underwear. And the photo doesn't add any new indiscretions. However, it's quite possible that seeing an actual pornographic, fully nude image will be enough to put the final nail in the coffin. One interesting detail is that this image will not be allowed on television which means people, in all of their curiosity, will look it up online, making them more actively involved in the story. That's something that could affect how strongly they feel about weiner and the scandal either"

A massachusetts state police helicopter spotted a body floating in the merrimack river in neighboring tyngsboro on sunday morning. A positive id is pending, but cops said they believe the body is jacob's. \" our thoughts and prayers are with jacob's family, friends, classmates, \" nashua police wrote on twitter. Cops were investigating why the sewer cover was open. They described a steep drop into a storm drain that links to a water treatment plant. During heavy rains an overflow system discharges water directly into the river. A frantic search began saturday morning after a passerby spotted the open sewer and beside it a baseball cap and umbrella believed to be jacob's. Surveillance video confirmed the teen was in the area, wmur reports. Jacob's family searched storm drains across the city, hoping perhaps he was trapped inside one and would hear their shouts. \" maybe he might have fallen in and he's just hanging on, and maybe he's too cold to yell, \" his uncle, darren blouin, told wmur. Devastated family and friends recalled jacob, who recently turned 16, as a good kid who avoided trouble and liked video games. \" jacob is a sweet boy with a great heart, \" family friend lauren comeau told the boston globe. \" he is his father billy's whole world. \" ( a freak hammock accident killed this teen. )",

Several cars caught fire, and local media showed images of what appeared to be a fire outside one of the buildings overlooking the prophet's mosque. The number of casualties was unclear, though reuters reports three bombers and two security forces officers were killed. The sprawling mosque is visited by millions of muslims from around the world each year during pilgrimages to mecca. The area would have been packed with pilgrims for prayer during the final days of the muslim holy month of ramadan, which ends in the kingdom on tuesday. Also monday evening, a suicide bomber and a car bomb exploded near a shiite mosque in eastern saudi arabia, several hours after another suicide bomber carried out an attack near the us consulate in the western city of jiddah. Neither of those two attacks killed anyone but the bombers. The possibility of coordinated, multiple attacks across different cities in saudi arabia on the same day underscores the threat the kingdom faces from extremists who view the western-allied saudi monarchy as heretics and enemies of islam. Saudi arabia is part of the us-led coalition fighting the islamic state group in iraq and syria. The violence follows attacks in iraq, bangladesh, and turkey.",

Voter turnout in the city has been declining for a long time and sank to just 27 % in a mayoral primary this may, according to the philadelphia citizen, which is offering the prize in its \" 2015 philadelphia municipal election voting lottery. \" the group says it will randomly select one of philadelphia's 1,686 voting divisions when the city votes in local elections on nov. 3, and will hand a $ 10,000 check to the first voter who emerges at a selected time, the philadelphia inquirer reports. The citizen says the funds will come from the pamela and ajay raju foundation civic group — and the giveaway is completely legal. On its website, the citizen, which was co-founded by former philadelphia daily news editor larry platt, admits that the plan is \" sorta icky \" — and that a similar giveaway in a los angeles school district was condemned as a \" superficial pseudo-solution \" to civic malaise — but says \" desperate times call for desperate measures, \" and the lottery isn't the only scheme underway to try to boost voter turnout. \" it's kind of a cockamamie scheme, \" platt tells the daily news. \" i want to give away money to see if we can get people to vote. \" ( low turnout isn't just a philadelphia problem: the \" abysmally low \" turnout nationwide last year was the worst since world war ii. )",

        "summary": "In the second massive us vehicle recall in the space of a week, general motors is recalling around 1 million pickups and suvs because of a power-steering software defect that causes a crash risk. The recall affects the 2015 models of the chevrolet silverado 1500, gmc sierra 1500, chevy suburban and tahoe, gmc yukon, and cadillac escalade, reports the wall street journal. The company says the glitch, which can cause the vehicles to briefly lose electronic power steering, has been a factor in at least 30 accidents and two injuries, but no deaths that it is aware of. When the steering assist is lost and suddenly returns, \" the driver may have difficulty steering the vehicle, especially at low speeds, \" according to a national highway traffic safety administration release. Gm says dealers will update the power steering module software free of charge, reports reuters. The journal notes that software glitches, while generally easier to fix than mechanical ones, are rapidly rising as a source of recalls — increasing an average of 30 % every year between 2013 and 2016, according to one study.

Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a kitkat. Even if that's the case, the european union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce kitkat knockoffs, the guardian reports. Nestle, which makes kitkats, has been fighting cadbury ( and then mondelez, which ultimately bought cadbury ) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The bbc notes that nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and wednesday's decision by the european court of justice essentially tells the eu trademark office it now has to \" reconsider \" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the eu intellectual property office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the kitkat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per reuters. The brand name itself of \" kitkat \" is not being contested. ( atari accused nestle of ripping off one of its popular video games in an ad for kitkat. )",

The european court of justice has thrown out an appeal by the chocolate bar's maker, nestlé, which argued that it owns the shape of the teatime treat.

French prosecutors said a terrorism investigation was opened, though authorities did not announce a motive for the bloodshed. The city is home to the european parliament, which was locked down after the shooting. It was unclear if the market — which was the nucleus of an al-qaeda-linked plot in 2000 — was targeted. The prefect of the strasbourg region said the suspect was previously flagged as a possible extremist. The gunman has been identified and has a criminal record, according to interior minister christophe castaner; one official says he was wounded by soldiers guarding the market. Gendarmes went to the suspect's home to arrest him earlier tuesday, before the attack, but he wasn't there, morisse said. They found explosive materials, he said. French military spokesman col. Patrik steiger said the shooter did not aim for the soldiers patrolling in and around the christmas market, but targeted civilians instead. Several of the people wounded were in critical condition, the interior minister said. President emmanuel macron adjourned a meeting at the presidential palace tuesday night to monitor the emergency, his office said, indicating the gravity of the attack. In multiple neighborhoods of strasbourg, the french interior ministry urged the public to remain indoors. Local authorities tweeted for the public to \" avoid the area of the police station, \" close to the city's well-known christmas market, which is set up around the city's cathedral during the holiday season and is a popular gathering place.

In the 17th century, it was an indisputable fact: boston puritans canceled christmas for 22 years, and those caught celebrating were hit with a fine, mental floss explains. A court order in 1659 warned against \" observing any such day as christmas or the like, either by forbearing of labor, feasting, or any other way \"; the ban remained until 1681. Working was required, and concerned puritans actually sent out town criers to yell, \" no christmas! no christmas! \" at the time, however, holiday celebrations were quite different from today's. For instance, the practice of \" wassailing \" saw less-wealthy colonists seeking food and drink from their richer counterparts — and when they didn't get it, things could get violent. The rev. Increase mather, meanwhile, was troubled by holidays spent \" playing at cards, in revellings, in excess of wine, in mad mirth, \" he wrote in 1687, as slate and the massachusetts travel journal have noted. In 1681, governor sir edmund andros ended the ban — but it wasn't until the late 19th century that christmas celebrations got popular in the area.",

With their campaign for the phrase \" merry christmas \" in stores and their brief boycott of target, religious advocacy groups like the alliance defense fund and the american family association are trying to prove him right. Gibson begins his book with an ode to the christmas of his youth and says that he's defending traditional public celebration of the holiday from bullying aclu lawyers and other secularists who are perpetrating a \" liberal plot to ban the sacred christian holiday, \" as the subtitle of his book puts it.

That adds to the tally of about 50 unmarked confederate graves found in the same part of the cemetery last year — a section known as yankee square that was originally created as a place to bury union soldiers, though their remains were exhumed and moved in 1866, fox news reports. The team's goal is to match up the graves with the \" detailed \" undertaker's notes that were made at the time, allowing the archaeologists to identify the soldiers buried there with markers noting each man's military unit and when he died. \"it's always been an unsatisfying answer for me to say, ' we know your ancestor is here somewhere, but we don't know exactly where, ' \" the cemetery's assistant director told the news &amp; advance earlier this month. The graves are shallow ones, and the team has only needed to dig about 10 inches below the surface — not to the point of reaching a body, but until a red clay patch appears amid the orange dirt. The red clay indicates the presence of a body, as the deeper, darker dirt that was dug out to create the graves was often used to cover the body. \" we can see any time that a hole or disturbance is put in the ground because the soil's not the same, \" says one team member. The team has also determined that that crisp outlines of the graves indicate that they haven't been disturbed since they were made. But it did make two mysterious discoveries: some graves were placed perpendicularly over older graves, and others had a circle-shaped brown patch on top of them — perhaps the remnants of a patch of flowers.

Steve mnuchin told abc's this week that nfl owners should create a rule forcing players to stand for the anthem and that athletes \" can do free speech on their own time, \" politico reports. The treasury secretary said the issue isn't race or free speech but \" respect for the military and first responders. \" \"i wish that some of these players that get on one knee to protest this country and all the sacrifices that make it great would get on both knees and thank god that they live in the united states of america, \" mediaite quotes mike huckabee as saying on fox news'sunday morning futures. The former arkansas governor said liberals only defend athletes attacking the country, not those praying for it. Karl rove told fox news sunday that trump should have picked a better battle or at least a better tactic, mediaite reports. \" he could have come away the winner, \" the former white house adviser said. \" instead, he is walking away from this a loser in the minds of the american people. \" a better move would have been to be an \" aspirational figure \" reminding people what's good about the country, rove said. Rex ryan, who introduced trump during a rally last year, said on sunday nfl countdown that the president's comments are \" appalling. \" \" lemme tell you: i ' m pissed off. I ' ll be honest with you. Because i supported donald trump, \" cbs sports quotes the former nfl coach as saying.

        "summary": "Secession is all the rage these days, and the latest movement is taking shape in maryland. The western maryland initiative, a group led by scott strzelczyk, is looking to break off the five western counties from the rest of the state, the washington post reports. Garrett, allegany, washington, frederick, and carroll counties are more rural; their residents are mostly white, earn less than their fellow marylanders, and are largely republicans in a very blue state. With about 650,000 residents, they make up just 11 % of the state's population; that's about the size of dc, notes think progress. Strzelczyk envisions a state — called western maryland or west maryland, reports the sentinel — with more \" personal liberty, less government intrusion. \" he's personally pro-gun, anti-department of education, and ok with medical marijuana. \" if you don't belong in [ the democratic ] party, you ' ll never have your views represented \" in maryland, says strzelczyk. \" if we have more states, we can all go live in states that best represent us, and then we can get along. \" ( he doesn't want to move to another state, however. ) but secession is notoriously difficult to achieve, and the sentinel points out that the 3,000 people who have \" liked \" the group's facebook page make up fewer than 1 % of the area's 407,000 registered voters. Political experts say the effort isn't likely to see results, and strzelczyk knows he has a ways to go — his effort doesn't even have a website yet. ( when it comes to possible secession, northern colorado's attempt is currently the furthest along. )",

        "summary": "Think carbs are a dieter's enemy? it turns out restricting one's fat intake leads to a 68 % greater loss of body fat than restricting the same amount of calories through carbohydrates in obese adults on strictly controlled diets — and this is in spite of the fact that a low-carb diet reduces insulin and increases fat burning. So says a physicist turned metabolism researcher at the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases who wanted to test a mathematical model he devised that projected similar results. Reporting in the journal cell metabolism, kevin hall says that while many believe that cutting carbs reduces fat faster, none had actually tested the impact of cutting carbs while keeping fat at a base line or vice versa. So he checked 19 consenting non-diabetic adults with obesity into to a metabolic ward for two 2-week periods, controlling and accounting for every single bite they ate. As his model predicted, people lost more body fat when their dietary fat was restricted than when carbs were, even though a low-carb diet does indeed burn more fat. But his model also predicted that in the long term, these differences would become less pronounced for diets that have the same number of calories, according to the press release. \" over the long term, it's pretty close, \" hall says. He used data from dozens of controlled feeding studies from decades of nutrition research to develop the model, but he cautions that the study is both small and highly controlled, meaning people's unrestricted diets may cause them to eat differently. \" the real world is more complicated than a research lab, and if you have obesity and want to lose weight, it may be more important to consider which type of diet you ' ll be most likely to stick to over time, \" he tells the national institutes of health.

Six scientists and one government official face charges of manslaughter for allegedly failing to provide adequate warning of imminent disaster to locals after the region was struck by more than 400 low-magnitude tremors in the months preceding a major quake. The group of experts met in 2009 to analyze the risk posed by the seismic activity, but didn't find cause to raise alarm. Six days later, a major quake devastated the central italian city of l ' aquila and killed 309 people, reports the afp.

The 41-year-old artist with als, or lou gehrig's disease, held the gathering to say goodbye before becoming one of the first californians to take a lethal dose of drugs under the state's new doctor-assisted suicide law for the terminally ill. \" for me and everyone who was invited, it was very challenging to consider, but there was no question that we would be there for her, \" said niels alpert, a cinematographer from new york city. \" the idea to go and spend a beautiful weekend that culminates in their suicide — that is not a normal thing, not a normal, everyday occurrence. In the background of the lovely fun, smiles and laughter that we had that weekend was the knowledge of what was coming.",

To perform the tests, the researchers report in the american journal of drug and alcohol abuse, participants were asked to read the newspaper or pray after being shown the images. Participants reported some craving following seeing the images, but less so after having prayed, while mri data showed changes in parts of the prefrontal cortex that controls attention as well as in regions thought to control emotion. \" this finding suggests that there appears to be an emotional response to alcohol triggers, but that it's experienced and understood differently when someone has the protection of the aa experience, \" says senior author marc galanter, who published a book on alcoholics anonymous earlier this year. He goes on to suggest that the reduction in cravings in aa members correlates to the amount of time that has elapsed since one's so-called \" spiritual awakening, \" which aa describes as taking a different attitude toward drinking. In previous research, participants asked to pray every day for four weeks drank about half as much as those who were not. ( see why some have been challenging the 75-year hegemony of aa. )",

        "summary": "A clinic run by michele bachmann's therapist husband has collected $ 137,000 in payments from a program lashed by the gop presidential candidate: medicaid. Those payments are on top of an additional $ 30,000 in government grant money for employee training at marcus bachmann's clinic. The clinic, which advertises \" quality christian counseling \" for a range of mental health issues, also participates in a state subsidized health insurance program, notes msnbc. Revelation of the health care payments — in addition to some $ 260,000 in subsidies for a wisconsin farm owned in part by the bachmanns — is proving an embarrassment to the tea party candidate who rips such \" big government \" aid on the campaign stump. When minnesota's governor signed a law earlier this month expanding medicaid coverage to more state residents, bachmann railed that \" even more welfare recipients \" would be added to the \" welfare rolls at a very great cost. \" she's \" giving hypocrisy a bad name, \" says the executive director of health care advocacy organization families usa. \" it's clear when it feathers her nest she's happy for medicaid expenditures. But people that really need it — folks with disabilities and seniors — she's turning their backs on them. \" bachmann was not immediately available for comment, but has insisted neither she nor her husband have personally benefited from government subsidies going to the clinic or family farm.",

The university of tennessee researcher has found one particular caribbean species that apparently hunts together. Dinets'study in the animal behavior and cognition journal details his research on chilabothrus angulifer, or the cuban boa, which tennessee today notes is the country's largest resident predator on land and which apparently hunts fruit bats in sinkhole caves in a coordinated way. Dinets observed the snakes for eight days in the caves of desembarco del granma national park, where he had noticed they would hang from the ceiling near the entrance at dawn and dusk, ready to pounce when the bats flew in and out of the caves. But it wasn't just random positioning. The snakes hunkered down in close proximity to each other, in seemingly strategic locations, so when the bats tried to pass, they were trapped by a \" hissing, snapping curtain \" of boas, as sciencealert puts it. What signified coordination and not just a shared preference for one location: no snake positioned itself in the same \" segment \" twice. Dinets also notes that one to three snakes were present for each hunt; only two boas failed to catch a bat, and both were hunting solo. When successful, it took one boa an average of 19 minutes to catch a bat, but three only 6.7 minutes. What's unclear is how rare this is: there are 3,650 snake species, but the natural hunting habits of just a handful have been studied. \" it will take a lot of very patient field research to find out \" if others hunt like this, too.
