        "summary": "It's not the usual occupation involved with an fbi reward: airline mechanic. But the agency's miami office is offering $ 10,000 to anyone who can help it track down ociel valenzuela-reyes, who is wanted in connection with the 1996 crash of a valuejet plane that killed all 110 people on board, reports the miami herald. Valenzuela-reyes isn't accused of deliberately bringing down the plane. Rather, investigators think he mishandled oxygen generators in the plane's cargo hold — specifically, they didn't have safety caps — which caused a fire to break out. The pilot reported the blaze soon after takeoff and crashed in the everglades before being able to return to the airport. Valenzuela-reyes was criminally charged in 1999, but \" he fled before trial, \" says miami special agent jacqueline fruge, who has led the investigation since the plane went down, per an fbi release. \" we want closure. \" one theory is that valenzuela-reyes is living under a false identity in santiago, chile, where he has family. The new fbi poster was being circulated in that country as well as in the us. Valenzuela-reyes also has connections to atlanta through his ex-wife and children.",

Valujet flight 592 had taken off from miami international airport on may 11, 1996, when the pilot reported a fire in the cargo area about 10 minutes into the flight. The plane was returning to the airport when it pitched nose-down into the shallow, marshy waters of the everglades. Fruge vividly recalls video taken by responders in the hours after the crash — the eerie calm of the crater, the jet fuel, and the enduring image of shoes in the surrounding sawgrass and muck. \"it just went to pieces, \" she said.",

He may be in chile and may travel to peru, argentina, brazil, and bolivia, and other south american countries. He has ties to georgia in the united states of america. Caution: mauro ociel valenzuela-reyes is wanted for his alleged involvement in the crash of valujet airlines flight 592 in 1996. On may 11, 1996, flight 592 crashed in the florida everglades, killing all 110 people on board. Investigation led to the indictment of an aircraft repair facility in florida, and three of its employees, in connection with improperly packaged chemical oxygen generators that were loaded on flight 592 and signed off by company employees despite lacking safety caps. Valenzuela-reyes is the final employee wanted in connection with this incident. On april 6, 2000, a federal arrest warrant was issued for valenzuela-reyes in the united states district court, southern district of florida, after he was charged with disobedience and resistance to lawful order and command of the united states district court for the southern district of florida, and failure to appear for trial. Valenzuela-reyes was previously charged on july 13, 1999, with conspiracy to make false statements to the federal aviation administration and the department of transportation; false statements to the federal aviation administration and the department of transportation; and causing the transportation of hazardous material."

We meant to pay respect, not to offend. — spaghettios ( @spaghettios ) december 7, 2013 but some suggested that the spaghettios flap may have increased its brand awareness anyway: yeah, yeah, keep laughing, but i bet you guys hadn't thought of @spaghettios in years until yesterday. — seph barker ( @seph_barker ) december 7, 2013 while others simply noted the sad irony inherent in the whole thing: twitter has spent the last 12 hrs talking about @spaghettios. Humanity is doomed. — clara jeffery ( @clarajeffery ) december 7, 2013 campbell soup company, which owns spaghettios, did not return a request for comment from the huffington post.",

Now, however, a research team has gone further, naming eight specific genes — six of them newly identified — that play a role in your coffee intake, the ap reports. In a paper out today in molecular psychiatry, the researchers explain that two of the newly found genes deal with how your body metabolizes caffeine; two are connected to its psychoactive properties, the harvard gazette reports. The other two new genes haven't been biologically tied to caffeine — or even coffee — at all, the ap reports; they're connected to cholesterol and blood sugar. The identified genes don't account for a huge proportion of your habits: they're responsible for about 1.3 % of how much you guzzle. Still, that's comparable in size to the known role of genetics in alcohol and tobacco use, says head researcher marilyn cornelis. One's culture could play a more significant role, the gazette notes, and the researchers think there may be more related genes out there. The study's data combined information from many previous studies, covering about 120,000 people.",

The amendment, which calls for men and women to have equal rights under state and federal law, was approved by 35 of the necessary 38 states when the deadline passed in 1982, cnn reports. Nevada finally approved it in 2017 and advocates hope it will finally be added to the constitution if one more state ratifies it, though five states have rescinded their original ratifications, meaning there could be a legal battle even if the magic number of 38 is reached, reuters reports. The amendment failed in virginia's legislature earlier this year. The measure passed the illinois house with a single vote to spare in a victory that npr calls a \" stark turnaround \" for the home state of conservative phyllis schlafly, an anti-feminist activist who campaigned against the era in the ' 70s. \" years in the making, yesterday's vote in illinois brings us one step closer, \" says lenora lapidus, director of the aclu women's rights project. \" we look forward to more progress being made, and ensuring that women are explicitly protected against discrimination. \" with calls to revive the amendment growing stronger amid the #metoo movement, democratic rep.

Per marketwatch and fortune, a complaint filed by the girl scouts of the usa on tuesday in new york federal court revolves around the word \" scout \" ( and variations of it, like \" scouts \" or \" scouting \" ) and argues that the boy scouts of america — whose boy scouts program for 11- to 17-year-olds will soon be called scouts bsa as it starts to admit girls — is making things confusing by using \" scouts \" in different forms without the gender-specific \" boy. \" cited in the complaint as an example: a marketing campaign introduced by the bsa earlier this year that used the tagline \" scout me in. \" usurping \" scouts \" only helps \" marginalize the girl scouts movement, \" the trademark infringement suit says, by leading people to think the girl scouts ' programs or services are \" not true or official'scouting ' programs, but niche services with limited utility and appeal. \" the complaint adds that this murkiness is leading some parents to either mistakenly believe the girl scout and boy scouts have melded together, or caused some to sign their daughters up for girls programs in the bsa when they meant to sign up for the girl scouts, which the ap notes has seen a recent drop in membership. The bsa says it's \" carefully \" checking out the suit, which seeks monetary damages and an injunction on any trademark breaches, and that it thinks \" there is an opportunity for both organizations to serve girls and boys in our communities. \" ( lead content has spurred a recent boy scouts recall. )",

The 52-member senate gop caucus will be presented with the bill thursday morning in what majority whip john cornyn says is the \" start of the process \" of getting 50 votes to pass it, using budget reconciliation to avoid democratic filibusters, politico reports. Cornyn says some senators will agree immediately to vote for the legislation and there will be \" very detailed \" efforts to address the concerns of those who need to be won over. Senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, however, faces what the washington post calls an \" open revolt \" from senators on both ends of the spectrum. Sen. Rand paul says the plan sounds like \" obamacare light, \" while moderate senators, especially those from states that accepted obamacare's medicaid expansion, worry that the senate legislation makes even deeper cuts to medicaid funding than the house version. Sources tell the hill that two other issues likely to complicate the gop's path to 50 votes by alienating moderates are language defunding planned parenthood and the bill's predicted failure to include a $ 45 billion fund for treatment of opioid addicts.

They've given the third and final installment of the film series a lousy 13 % rating on rotten tomatoes, complaining mainly about a lack of passion in a film that's supposed to be about kinky sex between characters anastasia and christian. More on fifty shades freed, which follows 2017's fifty shades darker, based on the novels by el james: after taking viewers on a trip through france, \" fifty shades freed suddenly turns into a thriller \" and \" the filmmakers are equally as incompetent at this genre as they are at generating erotic heat in christian's playroom, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. He calls the film the \" most painful \" of the series and \" two hours of cruel and unusual punishment \" throughout which dakota johnson and jamie dornan \" look as bored as we are. \" kate taylor is no more kind at the globe and mail. \" the franchise's hint of self-deprecation \" is gone and \" romance-novel boilerplate that sounded clichéd on the page becomes outright laughable \" on screen, she writes. The sex is no better, \" less erotic \" than in earlier movies. Apparently to make up for that, there's \" a lame kidnapping plot that could barely fill a network cop show on an off night, \" taylor writes. \" did someone say ' freed ' already? yes, please. \" gary m. Kramer disagrees at salon. \" the film seems to have an intentional sense of humor \" and is both romantic and sexy as it includes \" the only truly erotic scene in the entire trilogy, \" one that involves ice cream. Overall, fifty shades freed is \" actually really mostly pretty good \" and the best of the series, he says. \" there is a whole season full of soap operatics in store for viewers here and that is partly what makes it so enjoyable. \" sure, fifty shades freed is the \" least aggravating \" film of the trilogy, but that doesn't make it a good movie, james berardinelli writes at reelviews. Among his complaints: there's no \" steam \" to the sex scenes, johnson and dornan lack chemistry, and the plot just isn't compelling.

Mike leavitt was utah governor for 10 years and chose romney to run the 2002 olympics. He also served as epa administrator and then health secretary under george w. Bush, cnn reports. But salon notes that leavitt may be an odd choice, given that his consultancy, leavitt partners, has won contracts to help establish obamacare — including a $ 1 million deal two weeks ago. And the confidence doesn't end there, per maggie haberman. Writing for politico, she notes that romney has thus far opted not to team up with an \" all-seeing adviser \" a la karl rove. Instead, sources tell her the man behind the man is... Romney himself. Supporter/former sen. Jim talent explains that the candidate \" likes a pretty horizontal organization where there's a number of different inputs into him. \" haberman reports of a \" ceo-structure \" to romney's campaign, which relies on input from a core group: campaign manager matt rhoades, ad-maker stuart stevens, and longtime advisers beth myers and eric fehrnstrom. Some tell haberman that the group approach is better than appointing an \" overlord, \" but she notes that ' nomination narratives are full of cautionary tales about candidates who couldn't see the proverbial strategic forest because they obsessed over every decision, creating a leadership vacuum. \"",

After months of rumors, ufc president dana white announced the sale to a group led by hollywood talent agency wme-img — which boasts ufc stars like ronda rousey as clients and has ari emanuel as its co-ceo — on sunday night, reports the ap. The deal marks a major milestone for the global entertainment brand, bought by casino owners lorenzo and frank fertitta in 2000 for just $ 2 million, reports the new york times. Taking advantage of social media marketing, distribution partnerships, and licensing deals, they transformed the brand into one that brought in $ 600 million in revenue last year. The fertitta brothers will retain a minority interest in the company while white, their high school buddy, will continue running the ufc. Though the sport was once referred to by john mccain as \" human cockfighting, \" the ufc now has more than 500 athletes under contract, hosts some 40 events each year, and is broadcast in 156 countries, per the ap. \" we've been honored to have ufc and a number of its athletes as clients and couldn't be happier to take our relationship to this next level as the organization's owner and operating partner, \" emanuel says. \" ufc has experienced tremendous growth over the last decade and we are looking forward to helping the organization and its athletes identify new opportunities to develop and further establish their global footprint. \" private equity firms silver lake partners, which owns wme-img, and kohlberg kravis roberts are backing the deal along with michael dell's investment firm.",

But that's exactly what happened at the university of alberta in canada, reports the cbc. School officials say they lost about 13 % of their ice core samples — part of the canadian ice core archive — when a $ 4 million freezer system soared to about 100 degrees fahrenheit. ( it should have have been about 40 below zero. ) not only did the freezer fail, but so did a monitoring system designed to alert officials of temperature changes. Luckily, a high-heat alarm at the facility was finally triggered, and researchers were able to stem the damage. One quirk helped greatly: much of the ice had been in an adjacent freezer unit — but only because a tv crew was planning to do a show about the ice and the lighting was better in that one. \" for every ice-core facility on the planet, this is their no. 1 nightmare, \" glaciologist martin sharp tells the edmonton journal. \" when you lose part of an ice core, you lose part of the record of past climates, past environments — an archive of the history of our atmosphere. \" the effect on research is unclear, though the globe and mail characterizes it as \" disappointing but likely not crippling. \" the entire collection amounts to nearly a mile of ice and provides a snapshot of climate change in the canadian arctic going back 80,000 years. About 600 feet of ice was lost in the snafu, though no single core was fully destroyed. The samples were extracted over the last 40 years. School officials promise a thorough investigation of what went wrong and better safeguards to prevent similar glitches. ( scientists are searching for 1.5 million-year-old ice. )",

It adds that the deal essentially \" turns turkey into the region's refugee camp. \" in return, turkey will get $ 6.6 billion, quicker hearings on possible eu membership, and the possibility of visa-free travel throughout the eu. According to the wall street journal, eu countries will take one legally processed syrian refugee — up to 72,000 — from turkey for every refugee returned attempting to enter greece. Eu leaders say they want to stop the \" human suffering \" of migrants who are paying smugglers to get them from turkey to greece by sea. More than 350 migrants and refugees have died making the trip this year. Critics of the deal, including many human rights groups, say it will only increase the suffering of migrants, as well as possibly violating both eu and international laws. Turkey doesn't hold to the geneva convention when it comes to refugees. \"turkey itself is a human-rights-abusing country, \" the director of human rights watch in germany tells the post. \" parts of turkey are now like a war zone. How does this make turkey an appropriate country to manage refugees? \" in order for the deal to be lawful, greece will have to offer individual hearings for any migrants who continue to make it that far, which will require a lot of manpower, reuters reports.

President trump, in a move that could affect millions of women, is planning to get rid of the requirement for employers to cover birth control in their health plans, the new york times reports. Trump plans to allow exemptions for any employer that has moral or religious objections to paying for birth control. This would fulfill a campaign promise he made to conservative groups, but it would result in large numbers of women losing contraception benefits that they now receive at no cost. The trump administration argues that the mandate could lead to \" risky sexual behavior \" among young people — and that the government already runs programs that subsidize birth control for low-income women. The issue was at the heart of the hobby lobby legal battle, which resulted in a supreme court ruling that allowed exemptions only for companies with very few shareholders. The national women's law center says it will challenge the trump administration move in court. For women who lose coverage, \" it means choosing between preventive care like contraceptives and paying their rent, their mortgage, electric bill, \" mara gandal-powers, senior counsel at the center, tells the washington post.",

The rules significantly widen the range of employers and insurers that can invoke religious or moral beliefs to avoid the aca requirement that birth control pills and other contraceptives be covered by insurance as part of preventive care. Administration officials and their allies on the right downplayed the impact of the change on american women, while women's rights and civil liberties groups portrayed it as a massive, discriminatory act. The rules, among the president's many moves to dismantle obama-era initiatives, fulfill a pledge that he made as a candidate to appeal to social conservatives and that he amplified this spring through an executive order to expand religious liberty. Loosening the contraception mandate is the administration's most concrete manifestation of that pledge.

        "summary": "The signature red spot we see in pictures of jupiter could fit three earths next to each other — in the late 1800s. The great red spot is getting smaller, and the reason is a mystery, reuters reports. It was some 25,000 miles across in the late 19th century; by 1980, it had shrunk to some 14,500 miles across, not even big enough to fit two earths. Now, new hubble space telescope photos released thursday show it has dwindled to a diameter of about 10,250 miles. It's long been an oval, but as it shrinks it's becoming more and more circular, a hubble press release notes. The spot is the solar system's biggest storm, with winds measuring hundreds of miles per hour. Scientists have been aware the spot has been getting smaller since the 1930s, but the release notes that in 2012 amateur observations revealed that shrinkage rate is accelerating, and now stands at about 621 miles per year. One theory as to why: it seems \" very small eddies are feeding into the storm, \" says a nasa scientist who plans to study their motion. \" we hypothesized that these may be responsible for the accelerated change by altering the internal dynamics of the great red spot. \" hubblesite offers another theory: \" some unknown activity in the planet's atmosphere may be draining energy and weakening the storm, causing it to shrink. \" ( another recent nasa find: a square \" hole \" spotted in the sun. )",

        "summary": "Japan's prime minister shinzo abe cruised to re-election victory sunday on a promise to take a hard line against pyongyang, and he says the country will now \" dramatically show counter-measures against the north korea threat. \" abe said monday that action against north korea will be discussed with president trump when he visits japan next month, the bbc reports. His liberal democratic party and its coalition ally now hold 313 of the 465 seats in the lower house of japan's parliament. That's a big enough majority to pass an amendment to the country's us-crafted post-wwii constitution, and abe plans to do so by formally recognizing the country's military in the document for the first time. The constitution currently has a \" pacifist clause \" that limits the country's military to a self-defense role, and changing it to allow a more robust military would still require approval in a national referendum, usa today notes. Abe, whose popularity sank to just 30 % in the summer but rebounded as the nation fretted about threats from north korea, is expected to continue his policy of closely aligning with the us, the ap reports. Abe has also promised action on what he says is the country's second big crisis, after north korea: an aging and shrinking population. \" the problem is progressing by the minute, and we cannot afford waiting around, \" he said monday. ( in 2015, abe's party reinterpreted the constitution to allow the military to fight in overseas conflicts. )",

        "summary": "A group of dedicated researchers have discovered a seventh position used by mating frogs and toads, and it's — in scientific terms — super gross. A study published tuesday in peerj describes the new position, the dorsal straddle, as \"a loose form of contact in which the male sits on the dorsum of the female prior to oviposition but without clasping her. \" basically, the male frog gets on the female's back without putting his front limbs on her, according to the ap. The male releases his sperm onto the female's back after 13 or so minutes and leaves. She lays her eggs then lets the male's sperm run down her back to fertilize them. The dorsal straddle was observed in bombay night frogs, and it was a \" very challenging experience, \" researcher sathyabhama das biju tells live science. Bombay night frogs only mate in india's western ghats over flooded streams during monsoon season. So researchers spent eight hours a night for 40 nights standing in streams, filming frog sex, and trying to keep their infrared cameras dry. It could take hours for just one frog couple to mate, as they repeatedly fell into the water and would have to climb back to their original position to continue mating. All that work — and sexual innovation — was largely for naught, as 12 of the 15 fertilized egg clutches recorded by researchers were promptly eaten by other animals. At least the bombay night frog and its dorsal straddle might get an urban dictionary entry out of it. ( meet the world's first known venomous frog. )",

Mounir el-motassadeq, convicted of being an accomplice in the us attacks, is being deported to his native morocco, the bbc reports. He had served almost 15 years in prison, nearly his entire sentence. He was being transported under heavy security, and was accompanied by several police officers on his commercial flight to morocco, but once he gets there it's not clear what will happen to him. Motassadeq was friends with mohammed atta, who allegedly flew one of the hijacked planes on 9/11, and other members of the hamburg cell of al-qaeda that orchestrated the attacks, but he has long denied involvement. Deutsche welle has an extensive look at the cell and how motassadeq got involved. Motassadeq, who arrived in germany to study engineering at age 19, admitted to the aforementioned friendships as well as to having spent time at an afghanistan al-qaeda camp in 2000; he also signed atta's will. After investigators found that he had power of attorney over a bank account owned by one of the other alleged 9/11 pilots and that he had arranged a bank transfer for some of the cell members who underwent flight training in the us, prosecutors labeled him as the cell's treasurer. He maintained, over five years of trials involving convictions, appeals, and overturned verdicts, that he was simply doing favors for his friends and had no knowledge of the impending attacks. He was ultimately found guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and being an accessory to murder, and received the maximum sentence. He was released early in exchange for agreeing to be deported, the ap reports. He can be arrested if he ever returns to germany.

        "summary": "The attorney for a woman who, as a teen, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide told the massachusetts supreme judicial court on thursday that his client was \" trying to help another troubled teen with a very difficult mental-health situation \" the boston herald reports. The actions of michelle carter, now 22, may have been \" misguided, \" daniel marx argued during oral arguments at carter's appeal hearing, but \" she certainly didn't kill \" conrad roy iii, who committed suicide in 2014 by filling the cab of his pickup truck with carbon monoxide in a kmart parking lot. During carter's initial trial, prosecutors said that she had persuaded roy to kill himself in text message exchanges and later told him via phone to \" get back in \" to the pickup as it was filling with toxic fumes. Assistant district attorney shosana stern on thursday told the court that carter knew she had \" significant \" leverage over roy and steered him toward suicide, the ap reports. As justices consider the case, they will be weighing two main questions, a new england law professor tells boston.com. First, was there enough evidence for the judge to find carter guilty? second, does a conviction based on her words, \" rather than anything she did directly, \" violate the first amendment? \" legally, it always struck me as a reach, a stretch by the prosecution to charge this manslaughter, \" daniel medwed, another law professor, tells the website. Carter was sentenced to 15 months in prison, but the sentence has been on hold pending appeal. It may be months before the court makes a ruling, wbz4 reports.",

What a rigged deal, \" trump, who initially said holt did a \" great job, \" told a campaign rally in new hampshire thursday. \" what's going on in this country is so sad. But it will change. Remember nov. 8th. \" in other coverage: politico reports that trump's campaign has ignored the advice of senior republicans and is now targeting bill clinton's infidelity, including the issue on a list of talking points sent to surrogates. Sources say the campaign is in turmoil after a disappointing debate performances and aides are looking at ways to change the conversation, including a possible last-minute trip to israel. Trump himself brought up bill clinton's impeachment at a campaign rally in new hampshire thursday, the ap reports, but analysts say the bill strategy could backfire, especially with women voters. \" the whole notion of trying to get hillary clinton to pay for bill clinton's infidelities is just strategically a bad choice, \" says gop strategist katie packer. The new york times looks at why ohio, long seen as the key swing state to win, is starting to fade in importance. The state is older and whiter than average, making it promising territory for trump, and clinton hasn't been there in weeks, focusing instead on florida, colorado, and north carolina, fivethirtyeight reports that polls since the debate show that clinton has had a post-debate bounce that puts her 3 to 5 points ahead of trump nationwide — not a huge gain, but a big enough one to give her plenty of electoral college routes to victory. The washington post reports that according to the new york state attorney general's office, trump's charitable foundation never got the state registration it needs to solicit donations from the public, meaning it could be ordered to stop raising funds and even return money it has already raised. Charity law experts say they are surprised that the trump charity appears to have made a blunder typically seen at much smaller foundations.

A new study has found teens in 2010 were eating more vegetables, getting more exercise, drinking less soda, and watching less tv than they were in 2001, the new york times reports. The study of 35,000 young people aged 11 to 16 found they were eating fruits and vegetables nearly twice as often, drinking 20 % fewer sugary beverages, and the number of times they exercised for an hour or more had gone up from 4.33 days per week to 4.53 days per week, think progress reports. And between 2005 and 2009, the teens ' average bmi went down. So that's the good news. The bad news is that the teens still weren't meeting the federal recommendations for an hour of exercise a day, while they did manage to fit in at least two hours a day watching tv, chatting online, and playing video games, the times reports. The study also found younger teens tended to get more exercise and eat more healthfully, with their habits growing unhealthier as they got older. And black and hispanic teens were behind white teens in almost every category, even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors.",

        "summary": "A big milestone came in the fight against aids yesterday, when the fda approved the first drug meant for hiv prevention — but there are quite a few issues to consider. Truvada, which has been on the market for years as a means of treating those who already have the virus, can now be marketed as a preventative drug as well. It's been shown to be highly effective — it can lower a person's chances of getting hiv by 90 % if taken correctly, npr reports — but it must be taken every day, and some experts worry patients won't use it correctly, the ap notes. Others worry that people on truvada will stop taking other preventative measures — such as limiting sexual partners and using condoms, the most reliable way to guard against hiv infection. The drug is most effective for people at high risk ( like an hiv-negative person in a relationship with an hiv-positive partner ) who take it consistently, and it must be coupled with regular hiv tests, counseling, and other preventative measures. \" it's not just, ' here's a pill, take it, and you're rendered protected, \" says a researcher. Another concern: truvada, which costs almost $ 14,000 a year, may not be accessible to one of the highest-risk groups — people without health insurance.",

Every december, he gives his aptly named wife, holly, a kmart receipt for her birthday. On it are listed hundreds of transactions, all the layaway account balances he's paid off at his local store. \" she said it was the best birthday present ever, \" he said. In 2011, it was 260 accounts to the tune of nearly $ 16,000. In 2012, it was more than 320 accounts and $ 18,000. This year he plans for a repeat. \" it's not passing out christmas hams or turkeys, \" said wilson. \" they have to pay at least 10 percent... This is something people have thought about and made an investment in. \" here's how it works.

Officials in cook county — which includes chicago, and is america's second most populous with around 5.2 million people — say the goal is to steer repeat offenders toward treatment instead of jail, the chicago tribune reports. \" the methods in which we are handling low-level drug cases here in cook county are simply not working, \" state's attorney anita alvarez told nbc, estimating that her office dealt with 15,000 misdemeanor marijuana cases last year. Under the current system, \" we continue to see the same individuals revolving in and out of our criminal justice system with no meaningful impact or outcome and at a significant cost to taxpayers, \" alvarez said. The overhaul — which was welcomed by a chicago police spokesman and the county sheriff's office — also applies to possession of small amounts of drugs including cocaine and heroin, which alvarez says accounted for around 10,000 of the 40,000 felony cases her office handled last year, the tribune reports. After she announced the overhaul yesterday, alvarez said she had no idea of the date's significance for pot smokers, reports the chicago sun-times. \" april 20 to me is just that, april 20, \" she said. \" i had no clue what 4-20 meant. \"",

Agents executed search warrants at two locations — a brick bungalow and an apartment in chicago's south side — on oct. 16, reports the chicago sun-times. No criminal charges have been filed, though police suspect individuals inside accessed far more celebrity email and apple icloud accounts than previously thought. An ip address in one home, traced to emilio herrera, 30, was used to access 572 unique icloud accounts — an average of six times each — between may 2013 and aug. 31, 2014. Nbc news reports herrera has not been identified as a suspect. The same computer made nearly 5,000 attempts to reset 1,987 other icloud passwords of \" celebrities, models, or their friends and families, \" according to federal records. Another 330 icloud accounts were accessed from a computer at the apartment. The initials of just 19 celebrities whose accounts were accessed are listed in the newly uncovered documents, including a.s., c.h., h.s., j.m., o.w., a.k., e.b., j.l., and a.h., reports the new york daily news. Known victims include christina hendricks, hope solo, olivia wilde, anna kendrick, jennifer lawrence, and amber heard. Records list another 11 celebrities as having accounts \" accessed or attempted to be accessed. \" an affidavit describes an fbi interview with j.l., in which she became \" very distraught. \" she \" stated she was having an anxiety attack and was visibly shaken, \" an agent wrote. Documents also note several victims were locked out of their accounts before the leaks and reset their passwords with provided instructions.

One tells the story of a time stewart screamed in a producer's face and threw a newspaper at her, only to later apologize and explain, \" sorry, that's bad jon.... I try not to let him out. \" there are more such tales of stewart's angry side in the book, forbes reports, and rogak notes, \" i ' m surprised that people are surprised by [ the angry side ]. You look at his delivery on the show, and i can see the seething anger in stewart. \" stewart also once screamed at seth macfarlane, the new york daily news reports. The book recounts how stewart called the family guy creator after macfarlane joked about stewart returning to his show during the hollywood writers'strike. \" who the hell made you the moral arbiter of hollywood? \" stewart reportedly yelled. Macfarlane once talked about the experience with piers morgan, calling it \" an odd hollywood moment. \" but, hey, the book also reveals that stewart lets staffers bring their dogs to work, the washington post reports.",

She follows him from his early days growing up in new jersey, through his years as a struggling standup comic in new york, and on to the short-lived but acclaimed the jon stewart show. And she charts his humbling string of near-misses―passed over as a replacement for shows hosted by conan o ' brien, tom snyder, and even the fictional larry sanders―before landing on a half-hour comedy show that at the time was still finding its footing amidst roiling internal drama.

Previews on what to expect: their personalities could not be more different, she the \" stiff headmistress, \" he the \" great salesman, \" reports the new york times. But observers quoted in the piece note that \" odd couples \" often end up great partners. Indeed, sometimes \" opposites attract, \" says may herself, per newsweek. This is a dicey trip for may, explains an analysis at politico. Britain needs strong ties to the us, especially post-brexit, which means she ' ll have to make nice with a man who is \" loathed \" by many in her home country. In a speech thursday night to republican lawmakers in philadelphia, may urged the us not to ditch the iran nuclear deal and to support nato, reports cnn. She also issued this line: \" the days of britain and america intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over. But nor can we afford to stand idly by when the threat is real and when it is in our own interests to intervene. \" the guardian's assessment of that speech: may knows a strong relationship is vital, but she ' ll talk tough when necessary. So what will they talk about friday? the big issues will be trade opportunities once britain exits the eu, intelligence cooperation, and the fate of nato ( which trump has called \" obsolete \" ), reports the bbc. Marketwatch lays out three more specific topics: taxes, welfare benefits, and airport privatization. Details here. May plans to give trump a quaich as a gift.

Per the new york times, four sources noted to be \" current and former american officials and saudis close to the royal family \" have said the erstwhile crown prince, 57-year-old mohammed bin nayef, has been banned from leaving the grounds of his jiddah palace and the kingdom overall. The alleged confinement is also said to extend to some family members: one of bin nayef's married daughters was reportedly confined to home ( her spouse and child could leave ). A saudi official notes the mandate happened right after bin nayef lost his royal standing to his younger cousin, 31-year-old mohammed bin salman, king salman's son. Sources say bin salman guards now patrol bin nayef's palace. \" it's an indication... Mbs does not want any opposition, \" a source tells the times, using bin salman's nickname, adding bin nayef likely wasn't planning any trouble. Saudi state media has been trying to depict a smooth transition, even putting a video on loop showing mbs kissing the hand of his older cousin, who then offers him well wishes. A senior saudi official blasts the times article, telling reuters the report is \" untrue, completely false, and baseless \" and that bin nayef may seek legal redress against the paper. \" his royal highness … and his family [ are ] moving freely and hosting his guests unrestrictedly, \" the official says, adding nayef has left his home \" on a daily basis \" since his demotion. However, while another saudi official denies it's \" house arrest, \" he seems to acknowledge there are restrictions, per the guardian, adding, \" it's just in the changeover period.

The researchers think yes, but not everyone is convinced. \"what can be shown is that dogs seem to want an owner's attention when there is attention being given out, \" the author of inside of a dog tells the times. \"this study confirms that. \" the dogs did not, however, push for an owner's attention when it was being directed at a children's book or plastic jack-o ' -lantern pail, reports usa today. The researchers conclude that the dogs were experiencing some form of jealousy that does not belong solely to the human psyche, one that may stem from early competition for a caregiver's attention to secure important resources such as food and affection, reports healthday via us news &amp; world report.

Their families decided that when they grew up they would live together and have children. Child marriages, outlawed in india in 1929, are still common in many parts of the country, especially in rural and poorer communities, afp said. A unicef report says 47 percent of married women in india wed before age 18. Unicef also says 40 percent of the world's child marriages take place in india. \" i was unhappy about the marriage, \" sargara, now 18, told afp. \"i told my parents who did not agree with me, then i sought help. Now i am mentally relaxed and my family members are also with me. \" girls married off in infancy often remain in their parents ' homes until they reach puberty and then are taken amid great celebrations to their husbands ' families, afp said."

        "summary": "Poop comes in all shapes and sizes, but one kind of marsupial produces oddly symmetrical, six-sided feces that have had scientists scratching their heads. Patricia yang, a mechanical engineering fellow at georgia tech, decided she needed to get to the bottom of why wombats expel poop cubes — the only known species to do this organically — and so she and her team set out to study the australian marsupial's digestive system to try to solve the mystery, phys.org reports. Yang presented their findings at the annual meeting of the american physical society's division of fluid dynamics, explaining that the researchers examined the insides of two wombats that had been euthanized after being hit by cars in tasmania. \" we opened those intestines up like it was christmas, \" study co-author david hu says, per science news. The \" gift \" they found inside, per cnn, was the discovery that as the feces of the wombat — which can produce up to 100 poop cubes each night — moves into the last 8 % of the animal's intestine, it shifts from a liquidy state to a solid, morphing into cubes about three-quarters of an inch in length. The scientists then inflated a balloon inside the intestine to find that the soft tissue of the wombat's intestinal walls were quite elastic, allowing the cubes to form. The reason that perhaps underlies the blocky excrement? wombats, which don't see so well, stack their stinky poop to mark their turf and let other wombats know where they are. If the poop specimens are shaped like cubes, they won't roll away. ( an aussie pol used his vacation time to help wombats. )",

What people aren't waiting to do, however: freak out about the official loss of much of their privacy online once the bill bucking the obama-promoted regulations is signed. Vox explains what this decision will mean to the typical american internet user, while gizmodo takes a more proactive privacy stance, discussing in depth how users can hide their browsing history from isps, including via a virtual private network, or vpn. More on this technology from around the web: lifehacker dives into the ins and outs of what a vpn is, the encryption technology behind it, and how it works as a \" middleman between you and the internet \"; further advantages and drawbacks are explored by fortune. Who's not so sure vpns are a sure bet to protect your digital privacy: wired, which notes resorting to using such a system effectively puts \" the burden of privacy entirely on consumers. \" if you do decide to spring for your own private network, don't cheap out, tnw advises. Otherwise, you may get exceedingly sluggish service. As a matter of course, those inexpensive versions \" suck. \" interest in vpns is definitely on the upswing. Torrentfreak looks at the numbers regarding web searches for the term.",

One exchange with the lead writer of the miss america pageant telecast questioned whether 2013 winner mallory hagan was \" preparing for her new career … as a blimp in the macy's thanksgiving parade, \" and questioned whether the people on the email chain were the only ones who hadn't engaged in sexual relations with her. \" it appears we are the only ones! \" haskell replied.

In fact, people's cognitive styles \" can be a better predictor of what music they like than their personality \" — such as how neurotic or conscientious they are — the study's lead author, a trained jazz saxophonist, tells popular science. To study this, the researchers had more than 4,000 volunteers complete the empathy quotient and neo personality inventory-revised and listen to and rate 50 music excerpts from a library of 26 sub-genres that aimed to mitigate cultural or personal ties to certain songs. They then calculated each person's scores across five \" music \" dimensions — mellow, unpretentious, sophisticated, intense, and contemporary — and found that cognitive style influences the very genres of music people like ( empathizers drift toward \" mellow \" and \" unpretentious \" music like soft rock and blue grass, while systemizers prefer \" intense \" music like punk rock and heavy metal ). Even within genres they found differences. Those who scored high as empathizers drift toward music that has low energy or great emotional depth, while the systemizers tend toward music that is high energy or positive. Top songs among empathizers? jeff buckley's \" hallelujah \" and norah jones ' \" come away with me. \" the systemizers far prefer vivaldi's \" concerto in c \" and metallica's \" enter the sandman. \" ( check out how ' 80s metalheads turned out. )",

Study 1 examined the links between empathy and musical preferences across four samples. By reporting their preferential reactions to musical stimuli, samples 1 and 2 ( ns = 2,178 and 891 ) indicated their preferences for music from 26 different genres, and samples 3 and 4 ( ns = 747 and 320 ) indicated their preferences for music from only a single genre ( rock or jazz ).

Introduction the empathizing – systemizing theory developed by autism researcher simon baron-cohen proposes that on a level below normal personality there are individual differences in the wiring of the brain that result in two different modes a person may process information: empathizing and systemizing. The theory developed out of baron-cohen's work with autism where he hypothesized that the autism spectrum is an expression of extreme systemizing, he also adapted it into the extreme male brain theory of autism. E-s theory, particularly its connection to gender differences, is controversial. The systemizing quotient ( sq ) was developed by baron-cohen, richler, bisarya, gurunathan, and wheelwright ( 2003 ) and the empathizing quotient ( eq ) was developed by baron-cohen and wheelwright ( 2004 ) for use in research and to substantiate empathizing –"

            "Why do we like the music we do? research has shown that musical preferences and personality are linked, yet little is known about other influences on preferences such as cognitive styles. To address this gap, we investigated how individual differences in musical preferences are explained by the empathizing-systemizing ( e-s ) theory. Study 1 examined the links between empathy and musical preferences across four samples. By reporting their preferential reactions to musical stimuli, samples 1 and 2 ( ns = 2,178 and 891 ) indicated their preferences for music from 26 different genres, and samples 3 and 4 ( ns = 747 and 320 ) indicated their preferences for music from only a single genre ( rock or jazz ). Results across samples showed that empathy levels are linked to preferences even within genres and account for significant proportions of variance in preferences over and above personality traits for various music-preference dimensions. Study 2 ( n",
            "You truly believe that kanye is the best musician on the planet. Is it simply a matter of taste, or is something else going on? although there's no doubt that music preferences change over time and are shaped by social factors like what our friends listen to and where we live, research has shown that our musical preferences is closely linked to our personality — from how conscientious to how neurotic we are. But are there other psychological mechanisms at play? surely there is an explanation that might explain why some songs have us scrambling to skip the next track while others trigger us to hit to the repeat button. In a study published today in the journal plos one, a team of psychologists the university at cambridge show that our thinking style plays a much bigger role than we had realized. Specifically, people with high levels of empathy typically have different preferences when",

What did ava duvernay manage with an all-star cast and a $ 100 million budget? here's what critics are saying about a wrinkle in time: though he applauds actors zach galifianakis and gugu mbatha-raw, joe morgenstern calls a wrinkle in time \" a magical mystery tour minus the magic and mystery, and a great disappointment, \" at the wall street journal. He argues moviemakers \" lacked an original vision \" and fell to \" illustrating the book … yet never found its emotional essence, or the intimacy and spontaneity to convey it. \" the writing is sub-par, too, he says. It just \" feels a little empty, \" as josephine livingstone puts it at new republic. Whereas the book conveyed a \" dreaminess, \" the art direction in this disney flick, and its heavy reliance on cgi, allow for elements \" so bright and polished … that they look videogame-ish, \" livingstone writes. \" the magic just never arrived \" and \" the kid in me left the theater sadly disappointed. \" not bruce demara. A wrinkle in time is an \" emotionally charged, tension-filled and ultimately satisfying \" film, boasting \" splendidly rendered \" special effects, \" sumptuous \" cinematography, \" beautifully detailed \" settings, and a \" sublime \" musical score, he writes at the toronto star. All that is topped by \" the wonderful and surprisingly mature performances \" of deric mccabe, levi miller, and storm reid, he adds. Reid is \" simply outstanding. \" ann hornaday agrees the young actors \" more than hold their own \" opposite powerhouses reese witherspoon, mindy kaling, and oprah winfrey. Indeed, they help present a \" pleasing \" ad­ven­ture that stands \" as a clarion call for young people rising up against the forces of cynicism, corruption and wanton cruelty. \" such value overpowers the film's \" convoluted leaps and hurried lack of logic, \" hornaday writes at the washington post.",

The lawsuit calls boucher's actions \" unnecessarily cruel, malicious, willful, wanton \" with total disregard for paul's \" rights, life and liberties. \" the lawsuit charges that paul has \" been deprived of his enjoyment of life \" and left with an increased likelihood of injury and disease. It also asks to prevent boucher from contacting the paul family or boucher \" will continue... The pattern of stalking and harassment. \" boucher pleaded guilty to assaulting a member of congress and was sentenced this month to 30 days in jail and fined $ 10,000. \" to the best of my knowledge, sen. Paul has not",
            "Days after sen. Rand paul filed a civil lawsuit against the neighbor convicted of assaulting him, the senator is now facing a counter lawsuit. Dr. Rene boucher was sentenced to 30 days in prison earlier this month for tackling sen. Paul and fracturing multiple of paul's ribs in november 2017. Sen. Paul filed a civil lawsuit against boucher on monday for damages from pain and suffering. On wednesday, boucher's attorney filed not only a motion to dismiss part of paul's lawsuit, but also a counter suit that claims sen. Paul should owe compensation to dr. Boucher. According to the complaint, boucher is seeking \" all compensatory and punitive damages permitted by law, \" citing the \" intentional \" actions of the paul family. The counter lawsuit also names sen. Paul's wife, kelly, and the rivergreen homeowners association. The complaint states that the pauls were in violation of the homeowners association's by-laws while repeatedly piling up \" unsightly \" debris, tree limbs, mounds of trash and other waste near boucher's property. Photos presented in the complaint allegedly show the piles of brush after the november 2017 assault. See below: the complaint also states at least two members of the homeowners association knew of the pauls ' violations, but failed to to act on them. According to the deed restrictions and/or"

The photographers, make-up artists, groomsmen, marriage license, and officiant were all outside the peninsula when police shut off access, but the bride, groom, and bridesmaids were downtown at the double tree inn. So mysinger and houdek went on abc news 4 with their desperate plea for an officiant to marry them — and city councilman mike seekings, who happened to be touring the area and see the broadcast, offered to help. \" there couldn't be anything more exciting than being part of that, \" seekings said. Hannah summer saw the coverage and tweeted an offer to photograph their big day free of charge. \" it's kind of a once-in-a-lifetime experience, \" the photography student said. She also got her roommate to be the second photographer and a member of a local a capella group to dj, and then the military stepped in and sent a humvee to get the groomsmen, who were stranded on the isle of palms. The couple moved their outdoor wedding to a ballroom just in time to pull the whole thing off. Even the wedding attire, which the couple described as \" dress to impress! \" on the knot, managed to mostly stick to the script, with a few rain boots. \" with everyone just putting everything together we appreciate it so much, and it feels great to finally call this man my husband, \" says the new mrs. Houdek. ( even a fire didn't stop this couple from tying the knot. )",

The contracts were awarded to companies from alabama, arizona, mississippi, and texas. Officials say four more contracts for prototypes of non-concrete barriers will be awarded next week. The decision was originally expected in june, but the process was slowed down by objections from companies that failed to be chosen as finalists. Officials say that the companies building the prototypes will not necessarily be the ones chosen to build the full version of the border wall, which has been criticized as unnecessary by democrats and others worried that fema funding might be cut to pay for it, the new york times reports.

        "summary": "A philadelphia judge says meek mill will stay in prison because he's a \" danger to the community. \" common pleas judge genece brinkley on friday denied a motion to allow the 30-year-old rapper to be released from a pennsylvania correctional facility on bail, reports the ap. Mill's attorney says they plan to appeal her ruling, saying it continues a \" long pattern of unfair treatment. \" nbc philadelphia, which notes the ruling was released monday, reports mill's team also wants brinkley to recuse herself, saying she took on an \" essentially prosecutorial \" role in the case and once asked the rapper to name-drop her in a song. Her decision comes after the state superior court last week told her to act \" without further delay \" on a 2-week-old request to free the rapper. Mill was sentenced last month to two to four years for violating probation on a roughly decade-old gun and drug case. Mill's probation officer and a prosecutor had recommended he not be jailed. The washington post notes most of his probation violations are related to him leaving pennsylvania without getting the court's ok or touching base with his probation officer. His imprisonment has sparked backlash in opinion pieces, rallies, billboards, and bus ads. The inquirer reports jay-z twice halted a friday show in philly to talk about the case, saying, \" if you see a young man put on probation for 11 years since he was 19 years old, that man is being stomped by the system. That man is in jail for doing wheelies and breaking up a fight, \" referring to probation-violating incidents brinkley referenced during sentencing in november.",

But after meyer lost consciousness, the pair eventually realized he was no longer breathing. They were too scared to call an ambulance or go to a hospital because they were also high on meth and xanax, berry told police, so they took the selfie and then moved meyer from the front seat to the back seat because he started to smell bad, police say. Then, berry told cops, she and prier drove around \" looking for a place to dump the body \" and, upon finding a rural driveway that apparently seemed suitable, \" pushed the body out of the vehicle onto the ground. \" police were tipped off about the selfie while investigating meyer's death, the joplin globe reports.
