        "summary": "When you need a little extra oomph during a workout, try swearing. Researchers from the uk's keele university report via the british psychological society that people perform better on tests of physical endurance when they curse. Specifically, 29 people around age 21 took part in a cycling test, and 52 people around age 19 took a hand-grip test. They were all tasked with choosing a neutral word to describe a table, such as \" wooden \" or \" brown, \" and then a curse word they might utter if they hurt themselves, reports the guardian. They were instructed to repeat each of those words in two separate tests in a steady, even tone, and, sure enough, they were stronger when muttering the curse word. \" we're not telling people something they don't already know, but we're verifying that in a systematic and objective way, \" says researcher richard stephens. \" i think people instinctively reach for swearwords when they hurt themselves and when they're looking for an extra boost in performance. \" previous research has suggested that swearing also gives people a higher tolerance to pain, but exactly what's going on remains unclear. In the endurance tests, for example, people's heart rates didn't rise when cursing, suggesting that a \" flight-or-fight \" response wasn't at play. \" we have yet to understand the power of swearing fully, \" says stephens in a sciencedaily news release. ( swearing is linked to honesty, too. )",

        "summary": "A ballistics expert yesterday seemed to back up juan francisco lopez-sanchez's claim that he fatally shot kate steinle by accident at san francisco's pier 14 in broad daylight in july. During a preliminary hearing, the former chief of the san francisco police crime lab said the gun the undocumented mexican immigrant claimed to have found on a bench \" was pointed at the ground \" when it went off, sending a bullet ricocheting off the pier walkway before striking steinle, 32, in the back as she walked about 100 feet away, reports the san jose mercury news. \" you couldn't do this on purpose, \" the ex-chief added out of court. He told a judge the weapon, a.40-caliber semi-automatic pistol recovered from san francisco bay, has no safety switch and needs little force on the trigger to fire, reports abc7. Prosecutors agree the bullet ricocheted but say the shot was intentional and imply lopez-sanchez was perhaps just \" a lousy shot. \" the prosecution's firearms expert says lopez-sanchez could have still been aiming at steinle at the time. San francisco's chief medical examiner on wednesday said the bullet was traveling at an upward angle when it lodged in steinle's abdomen, reports abc7. \" it is an atypical entrance wound, which to me has a lot of significance, \" he said. \" this is anything but a classic entrance wound. \" tourist photos show lopez-sanchez was at the waterfront at the time of the shooting. He later confessed to firing the gun. Judge brendan conroy will ultimately decide whether he should face a murder trial; the preliminary hearing will continue sept. 3.",

In a statement provided friday to the ap, powell said he emailed clinton describing his use of a personal aol account for unclassified messages while leading the state department under president george w. Bush. Powell says he told clinton his use of personal email \" vastly improved \" communications within the department, which at the time he says did not have an equivalent internal system. The statement comes in the wake of a new york times report that says powell encouraged clinton to use a private server for non-classified emails. The times account is based on a forthcoming book by joe conason, who describes a dinner with clinton, powell, and other former secretary of states early in her term. At the dinner, \" powell told her to use her own email, as he had done, \" writes conason in man of the world: the further endeavors of bill clinton. The statement from powell's office says he has no recollection of saying that, only of writing the email, per politico. Powell said the fbi may have obtained a copy of his memo to clinton during its year-long investigation into clinton's use of a private email server to handle sensitive information during her time as secretary.

The afghan taliban, acknowledging mullah mansour's death for the first time, announced wednesday that he will be succeeded by one of his deputies, mawlawi haibatullah akhundzada. The bbc reports that unlike mansour, akhundzada is an uncontroversial choice who has, until now, served more as a religious leader than a military commander and has issued most of the group's fatwas. Akhundzada is believed to be a member of the powerful noorzai tribe from kandahar, which analysts say will make it easier for him to unite the group. The bbc puts the new leader's age at somewhere between 45 and 50, though reuters reports that it's closer to 60. He is a former aide to mullah omar, according to taliban sources, and like that leader, he is notoriously camera-shy. On the same day akhundzada was named as the group's leader, the afghan taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that hit a minibus carrying court employees in kabul that killed at least 10 people, the ap reports. ( president obama described mansour's killing as an \" important milestone. \" )",

Drone strike at the weekend. Within an hour of the announcement of haibatullah akhundzada's appointment, a taliban suicide bomber attacked a shuttle bus carrying court employees west of the afghan capital, kabul, killing up to 11 people and wounding several others, including children. The new taliban leader was named in a united nations report last year as former chief of the sharia-based justice system during the taliban's five-year rule over afghanistan, which ended with their ouster in 2001. Sirajuddin haqqani, head of a feared network blamed for many deadly bomb attacks in kabul in recent years, and mullah mohammad yaqoob, son of taliban founder mullah mohammad omar, will serve as deputies.

The cdc says the red eyes are caused by \" chlorine binding with sweat, urine, and other waste from swimmers, \" creating irritants that can spread from the water to the air as the amount of waste in the pool increases, kfor reports. This makes eye irritation especially bad at many indoor pools, according to the cdc, which says pool operators should make sure there's plenty of fresh air circulating when there are plenty of swimmers. Dr. Michael beach, a man the cdc describes as its \" foremost expert on waterborne illnesses, \" tells women's health that the cdc thinks swimming is a \" fantastic activity \" and the agency wants to keep it that way by keeping people healthy. That means advising them not to pee in the pool — and to have a good shower before getting in, especially if they happen to be battling diarrhea. \" we have a new parasitic germ that has emerged that's immune to chlorine, \" continues beach, explaining that it's spread through people — and not just babies — swimming when they have diarrhea. \" we've got to keep it out of the pool in the first place. \" and if you think you're quasi-protected thanks to the dye that supposedly changes the color of the water when someone pees in it, well, it's a \" complete myth, \" beach adds.

            "Chloramines are a type of combined chlorine that form in water and then off gas into the air above the water. Most city, county, and state health departments limit the amount of combined chlorine in the water to 0.4 ppm or less. Chloramines can build up in the water, which means they can build up in the air if there is not enough fresh air surrounding pools and other places people swim in chlorinated water 1. This is particularly true for indoor aquatic facilities where air handling systems are not bringing in enough fresh air and exhausting enough chloramine-polluted air, which is common during winter months when heating costs increase.

The mayor said the metal posts — which will replace temporary concrete barriers in some places, making it easier for pedestrians to get around — will be installed in locations including times square beginning later this month, abc7 reports. \" these bollards will make sure vehicles can never come into places where pedestrians are, \" he said. The city says the permanent barriers, including concrete planters as well as bollards, will be installed over the next few years at a cost of around $ 50 million. Officials say installing the bollards in some of new york's busiest areas will be complicated because of the amount of infrastructure below ground, the new york times reports. \" if you want to make them so they can really stop a vehicle, they need to go some distance into the ground, \" says transportation commissioner polly trottenberg.

The state is offering a $ 1 million purse to anyone who can come up with a way to keep interloping asian carp out of the great lakes, michael eckert reports for the port huron times herald. The pesky fish, which the michigan department of natural resources describes as having the ability to cause \" economic, ecological, and human health harm, \" may be placing a $ 7 billion fishing industry at stake, as well as $ 38 billion from tourism and water recreation, per the dnr's \" invasive carp challenge \" page. Eckert has a couple of proposals of his own, though based on the column's tone, it doesn't appear he expects either one to be scooped up. One option, he says: fill the chicago sanitary and ship canal that connects the mississippi river basin to the great lakes — and which basically serves as a conduit for the carp to infiltrate — with sand ( an option others have suggested as well ). But eckert notes that those opposed to the plan cite the increased transportation costs for some local businesses that would result. His second plan, and probably more of a long shot: convince lansing to give up its annual revenue to pay anglers to take the carp out. \" it worked for wolves, \" he says. Meanwhile, the lansing state journal discusses a documentary by two filmmakers who grew up in the region on all of the different invasive species in the great lakes.

        "summary": "\" this is the biggest accident we have had in years in this region, \" said a german police rep of a deadly head-on collision involving two regional trains around 7am local time today. German police say the death toll in bad aibling, bavaria, has risen to nine, with the ninth body still being removed from the train; another 150 were injured, including 50 severely. All survivors have now been taken to safety and investigators are beginning to look through the wreckage. The guardian reports that the drivers of both trains are dead, and it's as of yet unclear why they were simultaneously using the same stretch of track in opposite directions. Further complicating matters, the stretch of line on which the two trains crashed is squeezed between the mangfall river on one side and a forest on the other, which is making rescue operations very difficult. The ap reports that rescue helicopters were carrying people on a rope across the mangfall to ambulances waiting on the other side, four hours after the two trains crashed head-on. Local media reported that the rail line is used by commuters going to munich for work; the city is located about 40 miles from the accident site. Usually schoolchildren also take the trains, but they are currently on winter vacation.",

Fraser, 35, has apparently claimed the world record for the \" greatest height catching a grape in the mouth \" at 101 feet, reports the valley news, though guinness world records still needs to confirm the feat, which could take weeks. While the world record for the longest self-thrown grape catch is a distance of 69.5 feet, no one had ever attempted to seize a record for the highest catch, so the new hampshire resident decided to be first. Using walnut-sized grapes dropped from a hot air balloon at an airport in thetford, vt., fraser succeeded tuesday in catching one dropped from 75 feet, then another from 101 feet. \" i really wanted 100 feet, so to get 101 was really cool, \" says fraser, who only realized the extent of his talent while seeing the blue man group as an adult. \" in the show, they were throwing marshmallows at the crowd trying to get people to catch it, and nobody was catching it, \" he says. \" then they threw one at me and i caught it. \" then he caught another. Fraser now hopes his skill will nab him another world record soon: he's tried to beat the world record for the greatest distance grape catch in the mouth using a sling slot — a video shows a man succeeding at over 354 feet — but has so far failed. Getting pummeled with grapes hurt \" so bad, \" he says. \" i felt like i was being punched in the face. \" ( this odd record involves a very long pizza. )",

Some of the 7,000 counter-protesters confronted a small group of \" alt-right \" protesters who had originally intended to gather for a \" no to marxism in america \" rally that was called off two days earlier, the daily californian reports. Anti-fascist and anarchist protesters attacked when joey gibson of the right-wing group patriot prayer arrived with a handful of supporters, reports the los angeles times. His group called off a \" free speech \" rally in san francisco a day earlier amid plans for counter-protests, including one involving dog poop.

The rate — based on an outbreak from october 2013 to april 2014 during which 66 % of the population was infected — \" means you have a 99 % chance of having a normal baby, \" an expert says, per the new york times. That's remarkable considering a child born to a woman with rubella in early pregnancy has a 50 % risk of birth defects, per the guardian. However, researchers caution that the rate of microcephaly tied to zika may vary greatly depending on the outbreak and location. Researchers identified eight babies born with microcephaly from september 2013 to july 2015. Previously, about two cases per 10,000 newborns was the norm. Though the mothers weren't tested for zika, seven cases were discovered around the end of the outbreak between march and july 2014 and \" such temporal clustering strongly supports the proposed association \" between zika and microcephaly, researchers say. \" it's still a large public health problem, \" a researcher notes. \" severely small heads is only'the tip of the iceberg, ' as many other birth defects are now studied as potentially correlated with zika's infection, too, increasing the burden of disability and devastation that these babies could be facing, if they survive, \" a doctor adds, per live science.

Many are billing this as the first law of this nature down under, though nitschke performed his first assisted death in 1996, during a brief period of legality in the country's northern territory. As a young medical school graduate, nitschke found himself drawn to the world of euthanasia and the work of dr. Jack kevorkian, the most famous euthanasia proponent in the united states. Inspired by kevorkian's death machine, nitschke set out to create an updated version that he called \"the deliverance. \" the machine was rudimentary, comprising only a laptop hooked to an iv system, but it worked. A computer program would confirm a patient's intent to die and then trigger a lethal injection of barbiturates. It successfully ended four lives before australia repealed the bill that legalized euthanasia in 1997.

Newsweek spoke with the 70-year-old doctor immediately after the state of victoria in australia, his home country, voted this week to legalize euthanasia. Many are billing this as the first law of this nature down under, though nitschke performed his first assisted death in 1996, during a brief period of legality in the country's northern territory. As a young medical school graduate, nitschke found himself drawn to the world of euthanasia and the work of dr. Jack kevorkian, the most famous euthanasia proponent in the united states. Inspired by kevorkian's death machine, nitschke set out to create an updated version that he called \"the deliverance. \" the machine was rudimentary, comprising only a laptop hooked to an iv system, but it worked. A computer program would confirm a patient's intent to die and then trigger a lethal injection of barbiturates. It successfully ended four lives before australia repealed the bill that legalized euthanasia in 1997. But ending legal euthanasia \"didn't stop people from coming to me saying that they wanted to die, \" said nitschke. \"i've spent the last 20 years fighting for the legislation that just passed. \" nitschke has aided in hundreds of what he calls \"rational",

        "summary": "Archaeologists parted the sands in california to excavate one of the last remnants of old-time hollywood: a giant plaster sphinx from the set of cecil b. Demille's the ten commandments. The director buried props from the epic movie ( the 1923 silent black-and-white version, not the 1956 charlton heston blockbuster ) in the guadalupe-nipomo dunes after the film wrapped. Among the props: 21 plaster sphinxes that were 12 feet tall and weighed 5 tons each. Archaeologists in 2012 managed to unearth the head of a sphinx they uncovered. Short on time, they left the body behind, and hoped to pull it out of the sands this time. What they were able to retrieve came out in pieces, but they also happened upon a nearby and largely intact sphinx before the $ 120,000 dig ended on monday, kcet reports; that sphinx will hopefully join the previously discovered head at a nearby cultural center. Demille went all out in building the \" monumental \" set, hiring 1,500 workers to toil for six weeks re-creating an ancient egyptian metropolis, kcet notes. Leading up to the gates of \" pharaoh's city \" were four enormous ramses ii statues, as well as the sphinxes. \" this was all before the age of computer-generated images — you wanted a big city, you had to build a big city, \" says peter brosnan, a filmmaker working on a documentary about the legendary demille set. Archaeologists had to dig out the sphinx slowly enough so its surface would dry, but quickly enough so it wouldn't crumble from air exposure, the lompoc record reports. But why did demille bury the artifacts? brosnan speculates the director didn't want the expense of carting everything out of the area, and that he balked at the idea of anyone else using the set after he left the dunes.

Filkins notes the interrogations zubaydah was subjected to were so extreme that cia agents asked for \" reasonable assurances that [ zubaydah ] will remain in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life. \" on tuesday the ap reports he sat \" expressionless \" in a short hearing tasked with determining whether he should remain at gitmo, where he has been for the last decade. It was zubaydah's first public appearance since his capture, with the initial 10 minutes of the hearing aired live in a secure room at the pentagon to journalists and others. The ap reports the government no longer maintains, as it once did, that zubaydah was a senior al-qaeda leader at the time of this capture; the cia detainee profile on him now says things like he was \" generally aware \" of the planned 9/11 attacks. Detainees cannot speak at their review hearings, and a statement read on zubaydah's behalf conveyed his \" desire to be reunited with his family and begin the process of recovering from injuries he sustained during his capture. \" the guardian suggests his knowledge of cia torture is a huge barrier to release.

The new york daily news reports michigan cops tracked jain down after seeing a video he posted on youtube that got into using re-created fingerprints to unlock phones. Without getting into specific details about the still-underway investigation, jain and his phd student assistant fill fusion in about the unusual investigative method. The victim had been arrested at one point, so police were able to give jain a scan of his fingerprints; because it wasn't clear which finger the victim used to unlock his samsung galaxy s6, jain will work up all 10. One particularly pesky complication: readers rely on the conductive nature of human skin, so jain has to add a \" micron level coating \" with tiny metallic pieces to the plastic fingers to make them conductive. Mashable reports he's been testing a variety of conductive materials. Whether this type of technology could be used on living suspects is another matter: fusion notes it gets \" murky, \" especially with fifth amendment protections for \" contents of the mind \" ( a memorized password ), but not for \" tangible \" corporeal evidence such as fingerprints. As far as the legal implications of breaking into the dead man's phone, any info found that could link the victim to any crimes wouldn't matter anyway as he's now deceased. It would a different story if cops wanted to break into the ( ostensibly living ) murderer's phone, notes 3dprint.com. Jain expects to have the fingers ready for police in a few weeks.

In a rare case of \" thunderstorm asthma, \" strong winds near melbourne on monday sent massive amounts of rye grass pollen into the air, making it difficult for many to breathe, reports the bbc. Ambulance victoria took more than 1,870 calls — six times the daily average — in just five hours during the storm, including 800 related to asthma or respiratory issues. One 15-minute span averaged a call every 4.5 seconds, reports 9news. \" it was extraordinarily busy, it was unprecedented, \" a rep says, adding that many calls came from people who \" had never had asthma before. \" the high number of calls meant wait times were longer than usual. Asthma sufferer hope carnevali, 20, waited 30 minutes for an ambulance, reports the herald sun, and she eventually died, as did three others, including an 18-year-old two days before his high school graduation. The ambulance service says it \" will carry out a full clinical review. \" the bbc notes 10 % of australians have asthma, but rye grass pollen is usually too large to get into lungs. Rain from the storm, however, would have broken down particles that were then whipped up by the wind.

The red cross says land-rights issues hindered its efforts, but reporters found other problems, like lengthy bureaucratic delays, changes in staffing, and a full year in which nothing happened. \" they never had a real plan for what they wanted to do in housing, \" says lee malany, who was in charge of the organization's haiti shelter program. He says red cross leadership, including ceo gail mcgovern, seemed more concerned with publicity than project details. Npr and pro publica look at the struggling haitian community of campeche, part of a port-au-prince neighborhood where the red cross promised to spent $ 24 million on rebuilding — but residents say it never happened. The red cross reacted with an email that accused reporters of \" creating ill will in the community, which may give rise to a security incident. We will hold you and your news organizations fully responsible. \" the red cross also says it provided haitians with temporary housing, rental assistance, clean water, vaccinations, sanitation, and other services ( but won't give details on projects or expenses ). A press conference about the report got heated in haiti this week, pro publica reports, and npr says there may be a congressional hearing. Click to see the red cross ' full response.",

Bowe bergdahl may have been suffering from when he decided to walk away from an army base in afghanistan in 2009, the washington post reports. The condition is known as schizotypal personality disorder. It's similar to schizophrenia, but less severe. According to military.com, symptoms include \" paranoia, incorrect perception of and interpretation of events, magical thinking, eccentric dress and speech, and extreme social anxiety. \" it can also include delusions and hallucinations, though unlike with schizophrenia, the person with the condition can be made to understand the difference between those and reality. An episode of the podcast serial released on friday reveals bergdahl was diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder by an army forensics psychiatrist last year. People with schizotypal personality disorder are prone to psychotic episodes, especially while stressed. Bergdahl claims he believed his commander was going to send his platoon on a suicide mission to purposefully get them killed when he left the base unarmed in the middle of the night. He says he planned to walk to another base and report his commander. Instead, he was captured by militants and held for five years before being freed in a prisoner swap. He's been charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Prior to enlisting in the army, bergdahl had failed in the coast guard because of his inability to \" adjust. \" one psychologist who met with him after he was freed tells military.com \" the ball was dropped \" in allowing bergdahl to enlist in the army. His court-martial is scheduled for august.",

            "Bowe bergdahl's belief about his brigade commander was a paranoid symptom of his \" schizotypal personality disorder, \" a serious mental health condition diagnosed last year by an army psychiatrist, the podcast \" serial \" revealed on its friday program. Friday's podcast was the second of a two-part episode that explored bergdahl's motivations in walking off his afghanistan combat outpost in 2009. The u.s. Army sergeant was recovered in a controversial 2014 prisoner swap after five years of torture, starvation and isolation by his taliban captors. Symptoms of the personality disorder, experts say, include paranoia, incorrect perception of and interpretation of events, magical thinking, eccentric dress and speech, and extreme social anxiety. Personality disorders usually become apparent after adolescence and are difficult to treat. \" it really does tell the story of bowe -- unfortunately, you know? \" said michael valdovinos, a psychologist who was part of the debriefing team that met with bergdahl after the soldier's recovery. Valdovinos -- who podcast host sarah koenig said had bergdahl's permission to speak about him -- was critical of how the army allowed the soldier to enlist in 2008 after he'd washed out of coast guard boot camp two years earlier, diagnosed with \" adjustment disorder with depression. \" \" somewhere, the ball was dropped, \" valdovinos said. Yet dr. Elspeth cameron ritchie, a forensic psychiatrist and formerly the psychiatric consultant to the army surgeon general, told the program that bergdahl's waiver was not unusual or especially alarming. She said the army relies on recruits to self-report problems -- which bergdahl apparently did -- and that any interview with a psychiatrist usually wouldn't determine a recruit's mental fitness. The stress of basic training tests a recruit's suitability, she said, and bergdahl did well. Bergdahl was, by all accounts, an odd young man, from an isolated, home-schooled background, steeped in romantic ideas about principled warriors. Civilian friends described him as gentlemanly and protective, but they also found that he had unrealistic expectations and was prone to making severe judgments when disappointed. His platoon mates also noticed his unusual behavior -- he removed his mattress to sleep on the bed frame and smoked a pipe instead of hanging out with the rest of them. But no one anticipated that he'd walk off the base because doing so was so foolhardy and presumptuous and a betrayal of his fellow soldiers. \" he broke this intimate bond that we all share with each other,",

That's the plight of 23-year-old rivka, 22-year-old tziporah, 18-year-old tzvi, and 15-year-old racheli herzfeld, four siblings from teaneck, nj, who are fighting what fox news calls a \" mystery illness \" that's weakening their muscles and progressively robbing them of their ability to walk, as well as plunging their family into at least $ 100,000 in debt. What makes it even more frightening is that doctors haven't pegged exactly what the disease is, notes the record, despite many tests over the past decade. \" it is a little bit concerning that we've done all this testing and still cannot really figure out what it is, \" one of the geneticists who's worked with the family tells fox. The herzfelds ' mom, esther, says the kids \" were all just … normal and fine, and seemingly healthy \" when they were born and were active and played sports as they got older. But when tziporah was 11, she started falling in gym class, and a neurologist initially diagnosed her with charcot-marie-tooth disease, an inherited disorder. Her brother and sisters also eventually started exhibiting symptoms, but tests for cmt on all four came back negative. Students at the school where esther teaches found out about their predicament and started crowdfunding to raise money for a customized van, home renovations, and medical bills for the herzfelds; a local synagogue and others have also helped financially. In the meantime, despite their condition — the girls walk slowly and carefully because they can't get up if they fall, and tzvi now uses a motorized wheelchair — the kids remain determined to find some answers. \" a question mark isn't really doing it for me, \" rivka tells the record, while esther notes, \" we believe in miracles because we don't have any options. \" read about their perseverance at the record and fox news.

Among those arrested: a retired sheriff's deputy charged with distributing child pornography and a special needs teacher's assistant who was trying to arrange sex with two kids, per the los angeles times. \" the perpetrators in these cases come from all walks of life, \" said arnold. The common thread, however, was the internet. \" it has become the preferred playground for child sex predators, \" arnold said. Investigators often posed as minors online to lead predators to stings; the washington post cites the cases of an army solider who was arrested after showing up to meet what he thought would be a young girl for sex and a former substitute teacher who was nabbed during what he thought would be a meeting with an 8-year-old boy. Still, \" we can't arrest our way out of the problem, \" arnold added. \" parents and children need to have frank conversations about how to stay safe in cyberspace. \" ( a huge child-porn sweep in new york last month led to the arrest of a police officer, a paramedic, a rabbi, a nurse, and a boy scout leader. )",

Then it's a vamp-out-of-water story. Soon it's a gung-ho comedy.

But it's \" terribly familiar and fatigued \" — \" a postgothic pastiche of undercooked camp and overproduced effects. \" as for depp's performance, he just mushes together \" bits and bytes of former roles. \" the movie is \" all dressed up with nowhere to go, an elegant production without a central drive, \" agrees roger ebert in the chicago sun-times.

Related coverage: nasa has compiled a time-lapse video of the developing storm, named jonas. Nbc news has a good breakdown of what's expected where. At slate, meteorologist eric holthaus digs into the forecast, noting how unusual it is that \" all the major weather models are already locked in so far in advance. \" which means: it's coming for sure, and it's going to be big.

How much? dc is bracing for 2 feet ( more in the suburbs ), philadelphia 12 to 18 inches, and new york city and long island 8 to 10 inches. See the national weather service for updates. The new york times has begun a live blog with updates on the storm. It could be dc's worst storm in a century, notes mashable. On that note, the washington post looks back with old photos at the infamous knickerbocker storm of 1922, dc's deadliest to date.

More specifically, they think that some male dinosaurs did so as part of a mating display to woo females, study authors say in a post at phys.org. The evidence? telltale scrape marks from claws etched into 100-milliion-year-old sandstone in colorado, reports discovery. Some were more than 6 feet long, and researchers at the university of colorado denver ran through several possible explanations. Digging for water? nope, it was plentiful in the area back then. Digging for food? nope, these were meat-eating theropods not interested in roots. And then the scientists zeroed in on the similarity to a mating ritual of modern birds known as \" nest scrape display, \" reports live science. \" during the breeding season, the males start to get excited and show off to their mates by scratching to say, look, i can build a nest! \" says co-author martin lockley. \" and they get so excited that they scratch, and move along and scratch again — they make dozens or hundreds of scratches in a short period of time. \" lockley's team realized the scratch marks they were seeing at sites well-traveled by dinosaurs bore these hallmarks. A paleontologist not involved with the study tells the christian science monitor that the theory makes sense. \" considering that modern birds are descended from mesozoic theropod dinosaurs, it shouldn't be surprising that birds ' ancient relatives would have done this, too. \" ( one of the biggest raptors ever was just found in the us. )",

Anthony david montoya, 18, a contract worker from hollis, oklahoma, died at a remote drill site accessible only by helicopter, according to hecla greens creek mine and authorities. Mine officials said workers receive training on how to deal with bears because of the large number in the area. Alaska state troopers said montoya was mauled by the three bears, all of which were killed before they arrived. It was not immediately clear who killed them. Montoya worked for idaho-based timberline drilling, which provides core drilling services at greens creek, the mine said in a release. His body was being taken to the state medical examiner's office for an autopsy. The silver mine is on admiralty island, which is about 18 miles ( 29 kilometers ) southwest of juneau and where an estimated 1,500 brown bears roam, said stephen bethune, a biologist with the alaska department of fish and game. Tours to the island that's largely uninhabited by people tout bear-viewing possibilities. The island also has the world's highest density of nesting bald eagles, according to the department. Its only permanent community is angoon, which is accessible by plane or ferry. However, run-ins with bears on admiralty island are fairly unusual, bethune said, noting there was a nonfatal attack within the past three years. Mike satre, manager of government and community relations with the mine, said employees and contractors receive training on bears. Workers are taught, for example, ways to prevent bear encounters, including proper disposal of food. Bear spray is available to carry between buildings and trained personnel use bean bags to scare away bears from established areas. The mine also has videos on bear behavior.

        "summary": "Smarter teens are twice as likely to smoke marijuana and drink alcohol than their classmates, new research out of britain shows, but they're far less likely to smoke cigarettes than their lower-scoring peers, the telegraph reports. London researchers who tracked pot, booze, and tobacco use among 6,000 young britons from ages 11 to 20 reported differences in age groups. During their early years, clever kids were less likely to smoke cigarettes but more inclined to drink. Pot use at this age was not statistically significant, time reports. But by their late teens, the smart set was 50 % more likely to sample pot or use it regularly. Ditto for drinking alcohol. Writing in bmj open, the researchers concede that while the \" role of academic ability in determining patterns of substance use is not clear, \" they speculate that brainy kids may be more curious about new experiences and winning acceptance from adults. High-scoring kids are more likely to come from more affluent families with access to alcohol and parental warnings against tobacco use, per the telegraph. But the continued use of alcohol and marijuana into early adulthood appears to rule out the theory that teens are merely experimenting. The findings are \" broadly consistent with the evidence base \" among adults, the authors say. There has been a downward trend in pot and alcohol use among teens, researcher dr. James williams tells the telegraph. He says that understanding substance use patterns \" can inform public health policymaking and help target interventions for those in high-risk groups. \" ( teen pot use dipped in this state after legalization. )",

After trump on saturday appeared to reference a recent terror attack in sweden, leading to much confusion over what he was talking about since the last terror-related incident in the country happened in 2010, the white house has since clarified that trump was referring, in general, to what he says are rising crime rates in sweden that may or may not be tied to immigration. Swedish authorities quickly responded that crime rates are falling, not rising, and that they'd be happy to discuss with trump both the challenges and the successes of their open-door policy on refugees. On monday, swedish authorities and trump were both still tweeting about the situation: trump's tweet: \" give the public a break - the fake news media is trying to say that large scale immigration in sweden is working out just beautifully. Not! \" the tweet from former swedish pm carl bildt: \" last year there were app 50 % more murders only in orlando/orange in florida, where trump spoke the other day, than in all of sweden. Bad. \" the washington post says some of the police officers featured in the documentary that trump may have been referencing, which looks at a possible link between crime and immigration in sweden, have said their quotes were taken out of context in the film. But on fox &amp; friends monday, tucker carlson, whose interview of the filmmaker who made the documentary may have been the fox news segment trump saw that started all this, said the president is right to raise questions about immigration policies in europe. \" the president ought to be precise in what he says, \" carlson acknowledged, but europe's immigration policies haven't \" worked very well at all.... So what are the lessons that we should draw from this?... They can't do it, how are we gonna do it? \"",

Although bin salman is never heard directly ordering khashoggi's assassination on the intercepts, sources say he can be heard mulling over ways to get khashoggi back to riyadh. The cia also based its conclusion on the fact that the crown prince is, in effect, the ruler of a kingdom in which nothing big happens without his ok. \" the accepted position is that there is no way this happened without him being aware or involved, \" a us official tells the post. One particularly critical phone call, said to have been made at bin salman's direction, was one placed by his brother, khalid bin salman, to khashoggi, in which khalid told the journalist he should head over to the saudi consulate in istanbul to get his marriage papers, and that he'd be ok doing that. Arab news reports that khalid is pushing back on those claims, ripping into the post on twitter for publishing such a \" serious accusation \" that he says \" should not be left to anonymous sources. \" \" as we told the washington post the last contact i had with mr.

Made the assessment based on the crown prince's control of saudi arabia, which is such that the killing would not have taken place without his approval, and has buttressed its conclusion with two sets of crucial communications: intercepts of the crown prince's calls in the days before the killing, and calls by the kill team to a senior aide to the crown prince. The c.i.a. Has believed for weeks that prince mohammed was culpable in mr. Khashoggi's killing but had been hesitant to definitively conclude that he directly ordered it. The agency has passed that assessment on to lawmakers and trump administration officials. The change in c.i.a. Thinking came as new information emerged, officials said. The evidence included an intercept showing a member of the kill team calling an aide to prince mohammed and saying \"tell your boss \" that the mission was accomplished. Officials cautioned, however, that the new information is not direct evidence linking prince"

Christian kroenes, who extensively interviewed pomsel for last year's documentary film, a german life, confirmed the news, per the afp. In the film, pomsel described how she joined the nazi party in 1933 only so she could work at german national radio, after previously finding work with a businessman and a lawyer, both of whom were jewish, reports the bbc and washington post. She then worked as goebbels'secretary from 1942 to 1945, when goebbels and his wife poisoned their six children and committed suicide, reports deutsche welle. \" i will never forgive goebbels for what he did to the world or for the fact that he murdered his innocent children, \" pomsel said in 2011. But in a german life, she said she \" knew nothing \" of the holocaust at the time. Instead, she believed jews were moved to territory in czechoslovakia that was annexed by germany in 1938. Those who now claim they would've done more to help jewish people were kidding themselves, pomsel added. \" the whole country was as if under a kind of a spell, \" she said. \" i could not put up resistance. I was too much of a coward. \" after a german life was released, pomsel explained she had finally decided to speak out in the hope \" that the world doesn't turn upside down again as it did then, \" per the times of israel.",

The turboprop monoplane carrying agnelli — who was traveling from sao paulo to a wedding in rio with his wife, two grown kids, and their spouses — crashed into two homes shortly after an afternoon takeoff in clear weather, killing all six plus the pilot.

Vale sa, the company agnelli helped propel to the top of its game, said in its own statement that it was filled with \" immense sadness. \" nicknamed \" iron man, \" agnelli — who took over vale's helm in 2001 after spending most of his career in banking — was renowned for his tough negotiations, what deutsche welle calls \" cutthroat instincts, \" and for bringing vale into asian markets, particularly china, the new york times reports. Under his watch, he propelled vale to become the second largest mining company on earth, and the largest iron-ore producer — increasing the company's value from $ 8 billion to a staggering $ 150 billion in just seven years, per a book on latin america's \" emerging multinationals. \" he had even catapulted onto a 2013 harvard business review list of the best-performing ceos in the world, appearing in the top five alongside the likes of steve jobs and jeff bezos. But agnelli clashed with then president luiz inacio lula da silva over the number of workers agnelli had fired during the great recession, and things didn't get better under rousseff, who ultimately forced agnelli out of vale in 2011.

The article noted that a group of \" prominent computer scientists and election lawyers \" ( including j. Alex halderman, director of the university of michigan's center for computer security and society ) had told hillary clinton's camp that she should ask for a vote recount in three swing states — michigan, wisconsin, and pennsylvania — based on \" persuasive evidence \" they'd found that suggested results there \" may have been manipulated or hacked. \" but vox's andrew prokop checked out the evidence, and he found that \" there's not much \" to the claim. For instance, the group notes that clinton got less votes in wisconsin counties that used e-machines versus paper ballots, but that \" proves nothing, \" writes prokop. Wisconsin neighbors iowa and minnesota also leaned trump ( and they use only paper ballots ); and michigan similarly uses paper ballots. Prokop also wonders why, if clinton's people received this news some five days ago, no recount request has been filed, with deadlines fast approaching. \" that seems to suggest they did not view the analysis as credible, \" prokop writes. Read the entire vox explainer here, as well as numbers wonk nate silver's \" very quick analysis \" on his twitter feed, new york times data-cruncher nate cohn's assertion that evidence is \" weak, \" and halderman's own medium post on the matter.",

        "summary": "A set of dubious honors for the volume of ice covering the arctic: it hit a record low in 2010, according to researchers, breaking the 2007 record — and those same scientists say this year may be a record-breaking one, too, reports the alaska dispatch. Since researchers began measuring arctic ice by satellite in 1979, it has steadily shrunk, down some 30 % over the past 32 years. In 2007, the arctic sea ice area hit a low of 4.13 million square kilometers; with two weeks remaining in this year's melt season, the area stands at 4.6 million square kilometers, reports reuters. \" given all the uncertainties and margins for error, it's tough to declare a single year a'record, ' \" wrote the team in their paper. \" however, the 2010 september ice volume anomaly did in fact exceed the previous 2007 minimum by a large enough margin to declare it a new record. \" the 2007 low resulted from driving winds that pushed ice against the greenland coast and high pressure that removed clouds and allowed more sun to melt the ice, reports the independent. This year, the ice is believed to be more dispersed, but its total area will approach that recorded in 2007.",

            "Ice breaks away from a frozen coastline near the norwegian arctic town of longyearbyen april 23, 2007. 500 miles from the north pole the minimum summertime volume of arctic sea ice fell to a record low last year, researchers said in a study to be published shortly, suggesting that thinning of the ice had outweighed a recovery in area. The study estimated that last year broke the previous, 2007 record for the minimum volume of ice, which is calculated from a combination of sea ice area and thickness. The research adds to a picture of rapid climate change at the top of the world that could see the arctic ocean ice-free within decades, spurring new oil exploration opportunities but possibly also disrupted weather patterns far afield and a faster rise in sea levels. The authors developed a model predicting thickness across the arctic ocean based on actual observations of winds, air and ocean temperatures. \"",
            "Some researchers believe that the actual volume of sea ice in the arctic has already fallen to a record minimum this summer. The extent of the arctic covered by sea ice this summer has also continued to decline – a trend seen since 1979 when the first satellite measurements were collected. Although satellites are good at measuring the surface area of ocean that is covered by the floating sea ice, it is not so easy to assess ice volume, which requires accurate measurements of ice thickness over wide regions. Satellites have produced clear evidence that the sea-ice extent – the area covered by at least 15 per cent of ice – has fallen consistently and significantly each summer over the past 30 years. Since 1979, sea ice extent in summer has fallen by around 30 per cent, according to satellite data. Walt meier, of the us national snow and ice data centre in boulder, colorado",
            "The total volume of arctic sea ice shrank last fall to the smallest amount ever observed during the age of satellites, according to a new study that used a ultra-sophisticated computer modeling program that incorporates ocean observations, submarine data, and space-age monitoring. But that 2010 record -- discussed in a research paper still in press and reported around the world by a reuter's dispatch from a greenpeace icebreaker -- may be already threatened by this year's polar meltdown. New estimates by the same team of scientists at the polar science center of the university of washington appear to show ice volume is now plunging faster than it did at the same time last year when the record was set. As of july 31, the last time numbers were crunched and posted online, the volume of sea ice appeared to be about 2,135 cubic miles -- more than 50 percent lower than the average volume"
