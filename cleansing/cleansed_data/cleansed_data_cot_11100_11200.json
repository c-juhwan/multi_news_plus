When gawker pulled the same stunt on trump himself, he responded in much different fashion: trump turned the phone's greeting into a campaign ad, as nbc's frank thorp demonstrates on twitter. In fact, trump is now tweeting the number and encouraging people to call. \"with your help and support, together we can make america truly great again, \" says trump in the message. \" visit me at twitter @realdonaldtrump and check out my campaign website at www.donaldtrump.com hope to see you on the campaign trail.

Nbc charlotte reports that the family was napping on wednesday — his grandfather says the boy and his mother were on the couch in front of the tv, and his wife was in a bedroom — when logan apparently left the house and got into the car, along with his dog. Logan's mother thinks she was asleep no more than a half-hour before waking up and finding him gone, wsoc reports. She eventually noticed her car's blinkers were flashing and found him, trapped and unconscious, in the car; the dog was dead. The grandfather suspects the time that elapsed was even less: \" anywhere from 15, 15 to 20 minutes, if that. \" he tells the herald online that the car was locked but the child had learned how to unlock the doors; he suspects the door was too heavy for logan to push open once inside.

Police departments scrambled to find out who was behind the emails, and it was ultimately deemed a hoax, but experts say \" hoax \" doesn't mean \" not damaging. \" that's because even if financial extortion wasn't the actual goal, the suspects still caused disruption. Even more worrisome, some fear it could have been a test run to gauge law enforcement's reaction — and that such disruption could be used in the future to force police to expend resources, making them vulnerable while a \" secondary more potent attack \" is carried out. More on what we know: read the emails: the police department in cedar rapids, iowa, and cybercrime expert brian krebs have both posted full examples of the emails that are circulating. In both messages, the sender tells the recipient to not take it personally and that \" this is just a business. \" they also stress: \" we are not terrorists. \" explosives and wallets: in fact, several versions are making the online rounds. The threats mainly vary in the type of explosives they mention, and there are different \" wallets \" to which recipients are supposed to send their cryptocurrency.

        "summary": "It's completely legal for people in georgia to take photos and videos up women's skirts without their knowledge, according to a 6-3 court of appeals ruling this week. The atlanta journal-constitution reports the ruling stems from an incident in which a grocery store clerk was caught taking multiple cellphone videos up a female shopper's skirt. The court of appeals threw out his conviction, finding his behavior was \" reprehensible \" but not technically illegal thanks to the current wording of georgia's privacy laws. It urged the legislature to fix the law, but the legislature doesn't meet again until 2017. \" so we're going to have six months or so where these creeps can run around doing this stuff, \" sen. Vincent fort tells wcgl. There have been similar cases in dozens of states, mic reports. Many privacy laws, as in georgia, make it illegal to photograph women in private areas, such as bathroom stalls and dressing rooms, but totally fine to do it in public, regardless of how invasive the photo is. In 2014, a judge in washington dc ruled women have no \" reasonable expectation of privacy \" in public. A lawyer in california tells mic the problem is that \"the law can never keep up with changing technology. \" fort says he ' ll move to correct georgia's law and stop upskirt perverts as soon as the legislature reconvenes.",

Otherwise, taking an invasive photo of a woman's body in public is still considered fair game. Although multiple men have been arrested across georgia for sneaking photos up women's skirts, the judges ruled in the recent case of brandon lee gary, a publix store clerk who was accused of taking upskirt photos of a female shopper, that criminal \" invasion of privacy \" laws only protect victims if the crimes take place somewhere that isn't visible to the public. \" no law currently exists which criminalizes gary's reprehensible conduct, \" the ruling says.

What it turned into was an ugly mess, as some 200 supporters of indigenous rights surrounded the restaurant and started banging on the windows. The sydney morning herald reports that the scene grew so unruly that gillard's security decided she needed to be removed from the building. And as some 50 police pushed a path through the crowd to a waiting car, she stumbled and lost a shoe. The ap describes gillard as \" distressed \" but uninjured; she later said she's made of \" pretty tough stuff. \" the herald says the angry crowd was spurred on by comments abbott made earlier about it being time the semi-permanent aboriginal tent embassy \" moved on. \" the mess of tents erected in the capital serves as a home base for those protesting australia day, which marks the day the first fleet of british colonists landed in sydney in 1788; many aborigines refer to it as invasion day, a nod to the fact that the land was settled without a treaty.",

        "summary": "The decision by saudi arabia, egypt, the united arab emirates, and other arab nations to sever ties with qatar on monday reflects a long-standing dispute between qatar and its regional neighbors. In fact, a similar fallout happened in 2014, but monday's events mark a \" severe escalation \" that could eventually alter the balance of power in the region, per an analysis at the bbc. Nations aren't just pulling diplomats, they're cutting off land, sea, and air travel, and qatar relies heavily on imports for its survival. Here's what's happening: terror accusations: the official saudi press accused qatar of supporting \" terrorist and sectarian groups \" such as isis, al-qaeda, hamas, and the muslim brotherhood. Qatar denies supporting militant groups and says there's no \" legitimate justification \" for the moves. More broadly: \" the feud — the most serious in decades among some the region's most key western allies — has been simmering for years as qatar increasingly flexed its political muscle across the region, including backing the muslim brotherhood, \" per the washington post. The saudis also accuse qatar of backing its arch-rival, iran. Bogus article? two weeks ago, a qatari news report quoted qatari emir sheikh tamim bin hamad as criticizing saudi arabia and praising iran, among other things. Qatar later claimed its news websites had been hacked, but the article seems to have been a factor leading to monday's actions, reports the atlantic. Trump's visit: another factor could be president trump's recent visit to saudi arabia, notes the new york times. Generally, analysts think the saudis feel more emboldened under trump, with one analyst saying the \" moves reflected a ' bullishness ' prompted by the trump administration's stances — on the confrontation with iran and on a willingness to look the other way on human rights violations. \" us military: qatar is home to the al udeid air base, where 11,000 us personnel are stationed and from which attacks on isis targets are launched, notes the ap. Trouble with the base could complicate us military strategy, and secretary of state rex tillerson has offered to mediate. Big shift? the base, however, may no longer be enough to keep qatar in the us ' good graces, writes david roberts at the bbc. Other gulf states might offer to replace it. \" the argument to president trump may be compelling: with us help, qatar might be persuaded to evict hamas leadership from doha and genuinely cut back on funding islamist groups.

The professors say that leading taliban members have concluded that the \" war is not winnable, \" and they're willing to make concessions in return for a share of political power, reports the guardian.

Here's what they're saying: according to andrew o ' hehir at salon, lucy is \" 2001: a space odyssey remade as a eurotrash action film, \" which, in fact, \" will make you dumber than you were already. \" if one thing can be said of besson, though, it's that \" he understands the virtue of forward momentum, \" o ' hehir writes. \" does it make sense? not at all. Is it boring? not that either. \" as for mick lasalle at the san fransisco chronicle, the flick \" is crazy, but in the best way. \" besson \" never slows down, never falls in love with sequences at the expense of story, keeps his running times down and always remembers that it's all about emotion. \" meanwhile, \" johansson deserves some kind of credit for somehow not looking ridiculous. \" besson delivers \" a brazenly mindless thriller \" that \" achieves new levels of absurdity, \" writes elizabeth weitzman at the new york daily news. It's not bad as \" bombastic summer entertainment, \" but besson \" is so limited in his vision, \" that lucy \" resembles a gorgeous robot more than a fascinatingly evolved human being. \" at the detroit news, tom long writes that the flick is \" completely nuts, \" while besson has \" gone pretty much full schizo. \" still, \" lucy has something to frustrate everyone, but just enough chutzpah to delight a demented few. \" at the same time, \" it does raise all sorts of questions you rarely find in a shoot-out flick. \"",

The handouts — pulled from a state database that teachers can upload material to — instructed the highland high school students to go on $ 5 date, and offered a list of advice from the opposite sex that the handout noted students should \" try and follow. \" on the girls'sheet: \" if you think you're too fat, keep it to yourself, \" and \" eat the food you order; don't waste his money. \" the boys, meanwhile, were told to \" say what you're going to order \" at a restaurant \" so she will have a guide in ordering. \" a rep for the utah board of education says all materials in the \" purposes of dating \" section have now been removed: \" they're inappropriate. \" principal chris jenson acknowledges that there's \" no doubt \" there is gender bias in the materials, while oxborrow, who the east idaho news reports is a therapist, accused the state of \" evidence-based misogyny \" and says the material \" puts our kids at risk \" at a time when they're sorting out their identities.

        "summary": "Newborns can pick out their mother's voice in their first days of life, and while the stimulating sound of mom's voice has long been connected to the early emotional and social development of children, little is understood neurologically. Now researchers report in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that they are finally \" showing the biological circuitry underlying \" the mechanism at play. \" we didn't realize that a mother's voice would have such quick access to so many different brain systems, \" lead author daniel abrams says in a stanford medicine news release. \" it's exciting to see that the echo of one's mother's voice lives on in so many brain systems, \" senior author vinod menon adds. To explore this more closely, researchers performed fmri scans on 24 healthy kids between the ages of 7 and 12 while each child listened to short audio clips of less than one second of nonsense words spoken by their biological mother as well as two women they did not know, reports live science. Not only were the children able to pick out their mother's voice 97 % of the time, but when hearing their mothers, they exhibited greater activity in several brain regions, including, as live science notes, those related to emotions, facial recognition, and, perhaps tellingly, rewards. And because this brain activity can predict a child's social communication skills, researchers say they intend to use this \" neural fingerprint \" to study the brains of kids with social communication issues such as autism.

Authorities say bo dukes helped a friend remove the body of tara grinstead from her home, then brought it to his uncle's pecan farm near fitzgerald and burned it, reports the atlanta journal constitution. Dukes isn't charged in the actual killing. Prosecutors say his friend, ryan duke, killed the 30-year-old grinstead — his former history teacher — in an apparent robbery, then asked dukes to help him get rid of her body. Grinstead's disappearance had remained a cold case for 11 years before a tipster came forward. Charred remains were found on the farm in february, around the time duke was charged with murder, reports wrbl. Dukes ' girlfriend, brooke sheridan, identified herself as the tipster last month, telling cbs news that dukes told her about the murder and the disposal of the body. \" i felt like i was gonna be sick. I didn't know who i was staring at, \" sheridan said, adding that putting grinstead's family at peace \" was more important than his freedom. \" dukes is charged with concealing a death, hindering the apprehension or punishment of a criminal, and tampering with evidence, per the macon telegraph.

        "summary": "Artificial light — and reduced access to sunlight — has put our biological clocks in need of fresh batteries. A new study explains that our fondness for an electric glow has messed with our sleep hormones, making us stay up later than evolution intended in exchange for a lack of alertness in the morning, the bbc reports. But don't fret — pitch a tent. A week-long camping trip can expose you to 400 % more sunlight than normal, helping to reset melatonin levels — the hormone that makes you sleepy — the study in current biology suggests. While melatonin levels should naturally rise in the early evening and wane in the morning, artificial light makes them peak later and last longer — that's why you may feel groggy when you wake up, science news reports. But after a week under the stars — electronic devices and flashlights not permitted — eight individuals found their levels coordinating with the rising and setting sun. Like a roof over your head but want the same results? replace a light bulb with an open window, and go outside more often. Even the dim light of a cell phone can mess with your internal clock, says the study's lead researcher.",

A new york man who claims baltimore illegally razed a home he owned there managed to get his case — which actually centers around a filing deadline, not the demolition itself — all the way to the supreme court.

Now he's back, and he wants his case, which was dismissed in january after the court didn't hear from him, well, heard. Chen now has a lawyer representing him ( former us solicitor general paul clement, a supreme court veteran ), and a document filed yesterday outlines the \" unfortunate series of circumstances \" that occurred. It reads in part that after checking his case's status in late october 2014, \" petitioner left his new york home for a business trip to california. Although petitioner had planned to be in california only for a short time, he suffered from a slip-and-fall injury that postponed his return to new york until late january. \" he hadn't arranged to have his mail forwarded, and he wasn't aware he could check his case status online. He returned to new york on jan. 22, and was \" surprised and dismayed \" to learn his case had been accepted but dropped 13 days prior.

        "summary": "It's been a year since the catholic church chose jorge bergoglio as its new pope, and while pope francis marks the anniversary with a low-key, week-long spiritual retreat with cardinals and bishops — he characteristically traveled there by bus — here's a look at how he's been doing over the last 12 months: people love francis: the first non-european pope in 1,000 years hasn't had trouble fitting in. Italian opinion polls give him the highest popularity of any recent pope, while the us approval rate sits at 55 %, even as the un has ripped the vatican a new one, the wall street journal and the bbc note. That's not to mention his 11 million followers across his various twitter accounts, the huge crowds, and pilgrims flocking to rome in record numbers. Compassion: his high standing could have a lot to do with the compassion he's shown divorcees, those who've abandoned mass, gay people, and jews and muslims, even though his views don't always get a lot of support from traditionalist cardinals. No deep change: but has anything really changed? a bbc correspondent notes francis has given us that perception — whereas predecessor pope benedict called homosexuality \" intrinsically evil, \" francis has said he's not one to judge — but it has been \" a change of style rather than of substance. \" as for the catholic church's stance on birth control or the celibacy rule for priests, there doesn't seem to be any budging. Still, e.j. Dionne notes in the washington post that francis ' first year has been \" an anti-imperial papacy \" from the start. \" he has not altered church doctrine, but his shift in emphasis has been breathtaking, \" and his ability to move beyond gay marriage, birth control, and abortion, shows his stance is \" primarily with and for the neediest. \" his overhaul of the congregation for bishops and appointment of \" outsider \" cardinals to advise him on church reform stands out, too, and shows a move toward a horizontal church, inspired by jesuits. \" liberals who would like to see significant doctrinal shifts from francis should alter their expectations, \" write lizzy davies and sam jones for the guardian. \" but that doesn't mean there will be no change at all. \" next up: the vatican bank will be at the heart of pope francis'reforms and he hasn't ruled out closing it for good.

But that doesn't mean the 94-year-old former ruler, who was ousted in a military coup last year, won't have a say in the outcome. At a surprise news conference sunday, mugabe announced that he would not support the man who replaced him as president after the ouster and who represents his own zanu-pf party, reports the bbc. \" i cannot vote for those who tormented me, \" said mugabe, referring to incumbent emmerson mnangagwa. The comments could make a difference: polls suggest a tight race between mnangagwa, 75, and his 40-year-old challenger, a pastor and lawyer named nelson chamisa, reports reuters. Mugabe's comments prompted mnangagwa to fire back: \" it is clear to all that chamisa has forged a deal with mugabe, we can no longer believe that his intentions are to transform zimbabwe and rebuild our nation, \" he said. The guardian, meanwhile, reports that long lines have been reported at polling stations throughout the country. \"this is a critical moment in zimbabwe's democratic journey, \" says ellen johnson sirleaf, the former president of liberia who is leading an international observer mission for the election. \" the elections today provide an opportunity to break with the past. \"",

Joe manchin of west virginia. That has changed in a big way, with major media outlets now weighing in. Some coverage: cnn points out an interesting contrast: one of the most vocal critics of mylan is sen. Amy klobuchar of minnesota — because her own daughter needs epipens for severe allergies. She now finds herself challenging a company run by the daughter of a colleague. Bloomberg sees evidence of \" lawmakers tiptoeing around the usual washington blame game \" in deference to manchin, with senators calling out mylan but hesitating when it comes to demanding that bresch herself testify. Democratic sen. Richard blumenthal, chair of the judiciary panel, insists that bresch's family connection will have no bearing on things, per the new york times. It's not the first time mylan has put manchin in an \" awkward \" spot, notes the washington post. He previously spoke out against a tax break called an \" inversion \" after mylan incorporated itself in the netherlands. Bernie sanders, for one, tied the controversies together in a tweet. The intercept has deeper background, noting that manchin himself put in a word with mylan's then-ceo in 1992 to get his daughter an entry-level job. She eventually became the company's chief lobbyist and played a role in shaping laws that have helped mylan. A post at consumer affairs heaves a sigh: \" manchin is expected to keep a low profile as the storm rolls through congress and dissipates, as many observers now think it will. After all, senatorial courtesy generally takes precedence over consumer protection. \" mylan took steps on thursday to make the drug cheaper for some.",

        "summary": "Two inmates escaped from a swiss prison last night, in a daring escape that police suspect was orchestrated by the pink panther gang. One of the two escapees, milan poparic, was a member of the international ring of jewel thieves, three of whose members have now broken out of swiss prisons in as many months, the afp reports. The other was convicted kidnapper, arsonist, and money-launderer adrian albrecht, himself a jailbreak veteran. Blick.ch noticed that the 52-year-old previously escaped from the same prison in 1992. While the prisoners were in the yard for an exercise period, a pair of armed accomplices rammed a van into the prison gate and barbed wire. They then set up ladders to allow the escapees to climb over the prison fence, laying down a barrage of cover fire with automatic weapons. Finally, they set fire to the van and drove off in a separate vehicle. Amazingly, no one was hurt in the escape.",

            "A bosnian from the \" pink panther \" gang of international jewel thieves escaped from a swiss prison in a dramatic break-out involving a fellow inmate and two armed accomplices, police said friday. Milan poparic, who was serving a sentence of almost seven years for a 2009 robbery at a jewellery store, is the third \" pink panther \" to escape from a swiss prison since may. Along with convicted swiss kidnapper, arsonist and money-launderer adrian albrecht, poparic broke out of the orbe prison in western switzerland on thursday evening, local police said in a statement. During an exercise period, the accomplices rammed a gate and barbed wire with a van, before using ladders to create an escape route across the prison's fence. They set fire to the van and made off with poparic and albrecht in a second vehicle. Prison guards came under constant automatic weapons wire to stop them foiling the escape, but no-one was injured. Police said they had launched a manhunt involving more than a dozen patrols from various swiss law enforcement agencies, as well as their french counterparts -- orbe lies just 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) from the border with france.

Such is the plan of the future library, which wired describes as \" part working library, part conceptual art project, part investment in unborn generations of readers. \" created by scottish artist katie paterson in 2014, the library will ask an author to hand over a new work — unread by anyone except the author — each year until 2114. Only then will a vault at norway's deichman public library open for future readers, allowing the manuscripts to be printed on paper from 1,000 spruce trees specifically planted two years ago for that reason. The authors can write about anything and \" in a way, it's very pure, \" says mitchell, author of 2004's cloud atlas and the second author to submit a work after atwood in 2015. \" it was a bit tough, erasing it from inside the wastepaper bin on my laptop, \" but \" in a weird way, this work is safer than all of my other books put together. Chances are, no copies of cloud atlas will still be around 100 years from now, \" he says. Sjon, an icelandic author who will present the third work next june, acknowledges that his language, now spoken by 330,000 people, might be gone by then, too.

On the morning of jan. 25 he left his $ 900,000 home in palm beach gardens, fla., for that walk, with a camera in his gated country-club community recording him at 5: 53am. At 6: 30am, the camera picked up the sound of a gunshot. Abrahamson was dead. It was assumed to be murder, but there was no indication of a struggle and no weapon or shell casing. The palm beach post reports there was just one unusual clue at the scene: a very thin line of blood that ran from the wound in his heart to his shoulder. But when police accessed abrahamson's email, they found something else: he had purchased two weather balloons, though no one they interviewed thought he had any interest in weather balloons, weather, or aerial photography. His internet history gave up more secrets: he had emailed the seller four times asking about things like burst altitude; his google maps history revealed a jan. 23 visit to an industrial supply store where police learned he had bought a 40-cubic-foot helium tank; internet searches regarding suicide dated to 2009. The washington post reports one february 2017 search read, \" can you have a gunshot suicide with no weapon present? \" what police described as a \" far-fetched \" but \" plausible \" theory formed: that abrahamson attached a gun to the balloon, ran a string from the trigger to his finger, and shot himself, with the balloon carrying away the weapon and the string dragging that line of blood across his sweatshirt. Using a simulator, they determined the balloon could have carried a gun north of the bahamas and into the atlantic. By early march, they had closed the case, ruling it a suicide.",

The artist painted a life-size mural of jobs, whose biological father was a syrian native, at a migrant camp in calais, reports the guardian. It depicts jobs as a migrant himself, carrying an early model apple computer, along with a bag of belongings slung over his shoulder. \" we found out about the presence of this artwork on friday and have decided to protect it, so it is not damaged, \" says a spokeswoman for the city of calais. Authorities will shield it with glass or plastic panels, reports reuters. Banksy generally doesn't comment on his work, but he made an exception in this case: \" we're often led to believe migration is a drain on the country's resources but steve jobs was the son of a syrian migrant, \" says the artist's statement. \" apple is the world's most profitable company... And it only exists because they allowed in a young man from homs. \" fair enough, but issie lapowsky at wired thinks banksy is missing a crucial point. Sure, there may be some jobs-like people among the refugees, but millions of others affected won't go on to change the world.

        "summary": "The man who took a huge gamble to bring you hand soap via pump has died at 77. Robert taylor wanted to clean up the mess bar soap left in the soap dish, and so his company, minnetonka, introduced softsoap in a pump-topped plastic bottle in 1978. But in order to stave off competitors who he expected to quickly reproduce his creation, taylor took a big risk: he ordered 100 million hand pumps — to the tune of $ 12 million — and kicked off a $ 7 million ad campaign. His order was enough to overwhelm production facilities for more than a year, delaying the likes of procter &amp; gamble and sealing his own success, the new york times reports. The los angeles times puts a price tag on that success: he sold softsoap to colgate-palmolive for $ 61 million nine years later; unilever snatched up the rest of minnetonka for $ 376 million two years after that. He founded and later sold a total of 14 consumer products businesses, and grabbed calvin klein's floundering cosmetics line in 1980. He notably brought the fragrance obsession to the public via mini-movie ads that made waves; an nyt columnist at the time said they were \" nearly as steamy as r-rated movies. \" the lat speaks to daughter lori lawrence, who recounts childhood evenings with her father spent concocting \" soap puffs, \" balls of soap they cooked in their kitchen's oven. She shares this sweet remembrance: after her evening bath he'd say, \" tomorrow's a new day. There's always a new formula. \" taylor died of cancer on aug. 29.",

            "Sex has long been at the heart of marketing. Pretty women decorated coca-cola calendars back in the 1890's. But sexual themes -- particularly involving the undraped body -- are being used by madison avenue as never before to cut through commercial clutter and grab the consumer's attention. And if advertising trends in europe, where sexy ads often appear first before migrating to the united states, are any indication, americans are going to see ever more daring ads on television, in magazines and even on billboards in coming years. Some of the ads would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. Their increasing presence now underscores the risks of using sex, skin and shock to sell products and is raising fundamental questions in the advertising industry about taste, image and marketing strategy. Consider these examples, which are just a sampling of what has been appearing of late: * a spot for a lever brothers soap uses peek-a-boo shots of men and women lathering their stomachs, chests and legs. * the camera in a commercial for the shower massage, made by teledyne water pik, ogles a nude muscular man from a variety of angles. * a print ad for obsession, one of calvin klein's fragrances, features a naked man and woman standing face to face on a swing, pressed together from the waist"

A new study reveals that people speak in higher-pitched voices when they're speaking to someone they see as higher status. Writing in quartz, the researchers say that men and women who viewed themselves as dominant usually spoke in a lower pitch and were less likely to change it. \" a deep, masculine voice sounds dominant, especially in men, while the opposite is true of a higher-pitched voice, \" says co-author viktoria mileva per science daily. She says raising the pitch of your voice to an interviewer \" may be a signal of submissiveness, to show the listener that you are not a threat, and to avoid possible confrontations. \" people who saw themselves as prestigious, meaning people look up to them, were less likely to vary their voices at all. In the study published in the journal plos one, researchers asked 48 people to answer questions via webcam posed by three would-be employers rated as appearing dominant, prestigious, or neutral. Questions such as \" introduce yourself \" elicited a less dramatic change of voice than \" how would you approach your boss to discuss a problem? \" the researchers concluded that people \" subtly manipulate \" their voices depending on social context without realizing they're doing it. \" the more dominant you feel, the less you need to worry about other people's dominance, \" they write in quartz. \" at the same time, the more prestigious you feel, the more calm and relaxed you may be. \" ( another tip: the sound of your voice matters more than email. )",

Los angeles county sheriff's capt.

The move is an about-face, as tmz reports that police initially declined to open a criminal investigation after a new york times story that the 42-year-old settled a legal notice of intent to sue filed by bennett, who's now 22, for $ 380,000. That was shortly after she said last october that movie mogul harvey weinstein raped her. Bennett says in the notice that he had sex with argento at the ritz-carlton hotel in marina del rey, calif., in 2013. The age of consent in california is 18, per the times. Investigators have learned no police report was filed at the time, harris said. In a statement to the ap on monday, a lawyer for bennett said the actor \" does not wish to comment on the documents or the events \" at this time, noting bennett would take \" the next 24 hours, or longer, to prepare his response. \" representatives for argento didn't respond to a request from the ap for comment.",

The rooms app, currently available only for iphone, lets users create rooms to chat about whatever interests them. Not only do users not have to use their real name, but they can choose different handles for different rooms ( making it pseudonymous rather than anonymous ). They also don't need to have a facebook account to use rooms, explains the guardian. If you do have a facebook account, the two will never interact, per rooms ' privacy statement. As for how you get into a room you haven't created, techcrunch reports that each room will have an individual qr code that the creator can share — with just a few friends, or much more publicly. To keep trolls at bay, moderators have the ability to ban users. \" early users have already created rooms for everything from beat boxing videos to parkour to photos of home-cooked meals, \" a product manager explains in a blog post. \" there's even a room called ' kicks from above'that showcases photographs of cool shoes in cool places. \" people who create a room can add a cover photo, choose the room's colors, filter messages, and more. But like on facebook, standard guidelines apply regarding abusive behavior or vulgar material, and facebook can take down rooms. An android version is planned for early 2015.",

When an earthquake occurs, voids along a geological fault widen suddenly, pressure plummets, and the water held inside turns to steam. Meanwhile, the gold and silica in that water end up on local surfaces, scientists in australia suggest. It's not much gold, but it can build up over time, livescience reports. The phenomenon can cause gold to \" precipitate almost immediately, \" researchers say, per afp. And even the smallest earthquakes may be capable of initiating the process. \" given that small-magnitude earthquakes are exceptionally frequent in fault systems, this process may be the primary driver for the formation of economic gold deposits, \" says one of the researchers.

The gold is formed when a tremor splits open a fluid-filled cavity in the earth's crust, causing a sudden drop in pressure, according to a team of australian researchers. This, in turn, causes the fluid to expand rapidly and evaporate, and any gold particles that had been dissolved in it to \" precipitate almost immediately \", said a nature press release. \" repeated earthquakes could therefore lead to the build up of economic-grade gold deposits. \" the researchers said much of the world's known gold was derived from quarts veins that were formed during geological periods of mountain building as long as three billion years ago. The veins formed during earthquakes, but the magnitude of pressure fluctuations or how they drove gold mineralisation were not known. For this study, researchers used a numerical model to simulate the drop in pressure experienced in a fluid-filled fault cavity during an earthquake. In so doing, they answered a long-standing question about the world's gold resources -- how the metal becomes so concentrated from a highly dissolved state to a solid, mineable one.

The model provides a quantitative mechanism for the link between gold and quartz seen in many of the world's gold deposits, said dion weatherley, a geophysicist at the university of queensland in australia and lead author of the study. When an earthquake strikes, it moves along a rupture in the ground — a fracture called a fault. Big faults can have many small fractures along their length, connected by jogs that appear as rectangular voids. Water often lubricates faults, filling in fractures and jogs. About 6 miles ( 10 kilometers ) below the surface, under incredible temperatures and pressures, the water carries high concentrations of carbon dioxide, silica and economically attractive elements like gold. Shake, rattle and gold during an earthquake, the fault jog suddenly opens wider.

The ex-new mexico governor went up against both clinton and trump in two may polls, and while trump and clinton hovered within 3 points of each other in both polls — clinton got 38 % to trump's 35 % in a morning consult survey released tuesday, while trump came out with 42 % to clinton's 39 % in a fox news poll conducted may 14-17 — johnson walked away with 10 % in both matchups. And fivethirtyeight doesn't think these polls are necessarily may outliers, citing a monmouth university poll from march that gave clinton 42 %, trump 34 %, and johnson 11 % in a three-way runoff. Morning consult notes that percentage is nearly twice as high as what johnson got in most 2012 tracking polls when he ran against president obama and gop nominee mitt romney. And vox notes that if the experienced johnson is picked as the libertarian nominee at his party's convention in orlando, fla., this weekend — along with william weld, an ex-massachusetts governor who could become johnson's running mate — the libertarian ticket \" could have a real opportunity this november to run a real race against two of the least-liked presidential candidates in recent history. \" what fivethirtyeight also says johnson has in his favor: history, via other third-party candidates who did fairly well nationally ( e.g., george wallace and ross perot ). And the washington post says the case for a third-party candidate is growing. But fivethirtyeight also adds johnson only won 1 % of the national vote in 2012 and that he still needs to secure the nomination.

The new york times reports the lawsuit against dr. Jan karbaat, who died last month at 89, was filed friday in the netherlands. Karbaat ran the sperm bank out of his house from 1980 to 2009, when it was forced to close for not meeting storage standards. It's estimated 10,000 children were conceived at the clinic, but because of poor record keeping, the identities of the donors aren't considered legally reliable. Karbaat is said to have fathered 60 children while running the clinic, according to the afp. The plaintiffs in the case say they noticed a physical resemblance between karbaat and themselves or their children — but not to their supposed donors, the telegraph reports. One woman says she visited karbaat in 2010 and was readily told by the elderly doctor she was probably \" a kid of mine. \" a lawyer for the plaintiffs says \" it feels like they were raped. \" the plaintiffs are suing to have a posthumous dna test conducted on karbaat, his personal belongings, or his family. \"it's a fundamental right to know where one came from, \" the plaintiffs ' lawyer says.

Wearing \"fangs \" can take a frightening turn, as a woman painfully found out after her \"devil teeth \" became stuck and required an emergency visit to the dentist. Anna tew, who lives in mobile county, alabama, bought the accessory for about $ 3 to complete her zombie costume and applied the glue that came with the product, wkrg reported. With a bridge of spiky fangs attached to her upper jaw, the look was perfect for a halloween event on friday night. But when it came time to take out the fake teeth, they wouldn't budge. Tew tried to remove them until 2 o ' clock that morning, with the situation becoming ever more painful. Finally, she made an emergency appointment at a dentist. Tew, who did not reply to a today request for comment, described what happened next to wkrg. \" he talked about drilling.

        "summary": "Aspirin is already used for pain relief and as a treatment for cardiovascular disease and even cancer, medical news today reports — and now a new study published in plos one finds it could also be useful in the fight against alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. The central factor in the new findings: salicylic acid, the \" primary breakdown product of aspirin, \" per a press release. An enzyme called gapdh, if put under stress due to a lack of oxygen being delivered to the brain, can enter the nucleus of neurons, and once there it leads to cell death. Gapdh is believed to play a big role in diseases including alzheimer's, parkinson's, and huntington's, and one anti-parkinson's drug blocks the enzyme from entering the nucleus. The new study finds that salicylic acid binds to gapdh and also bars it from entering. Further research found that both a lab-synthesized derivative and a natural derivative of salicylic acid ( the natural derivative comes from the herb licorice ) bind to gapdh even more tightly, and do an even better job at blocking its entry into the nucleus and causing cell death. As such, \" salicylates may be of therapeutic value in the treatment or even prevention of several widespread and devastating neurodegenerative diseases, \" the study states. Adds the senior author, \" a better understanding of how salicylic acid and its derivatives regulate the activities of gapdh... Coupled with the discovery of much more potent synthetic and natural derivatives of salicylic acid, provide great promise for the development of new and better salicylic acid-based treatments of a wide variety of prevalent, devastating diseases. \" ( if you're over 50, here's why you should take aspirin. )",
