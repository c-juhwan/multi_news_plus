In a surprise revelation in the new york times, stewart cops to a stealth \" boot camp \" he's been running for a couple of years to help former service members break into the tv industry and, in some cases, into employment with stewart's own show. The intensive five-week \" crash course \" that teaches everything from editing to talent booking meets once a week in the evenings to accommodate veterans with full-time work schedules; the program wraps up with a career fair that has succeeded in placing some students in actual tv jobs. The unemployment rate for veterans in 2014 was 5.3 % — 7.2 % for vets who've been on active duty at any time since 9/11, the bureau of labor statistics notes. But vets drawn to the entertainment industry may have a hard time breaking in since they spent prime learning years with the military instead of in the studio, and because they may be perceived as too rigid for such a \" creative industry, \" a board member of the veterans in film and television industry group tells the times. The host had been keeping the program on the down-low to keep show superfans out, among other reasons, but now that he's leaving the show, he hopes other tv programs will follow suit. \" this is ready to franchise.

Such dangers included insanity, impotence, epilepsy, acne, poor posture, and blindness, in kellogg's view. Among his tips: avoid all \" exciting and irritating food, \" wrote the seventh day adventist. \" a man that lives on pork, fine-flour bread, rich pies and cakes, and condiments, drinks tea and coffee and uses tobacco, might as well try to fly as to be chaste in thought. \" he also invented a few grain breakfast cereals \" as healthy, ready-to-eat anti-masturbatory morning meals, \" reports mental floss. Brother will, who managed the sanitarium's books, helped him invent corn flakes but wanted sugar on them to help them sell — an addition john refused to accept. Meanwhile, john suggested more severe anti-masturbatory practices, like running a wire through boys ' foreskins to curb erections and burning the clitoris with carbolic acid to keep girls ' fingers away. Today we know the health benefits of self-love, like reduced depression, lowered prostate-cancer risk, and a better immune system, the conversation notes.

            "In 1993, steven spielberg's schindler's list brought to the screen a story that had gone untold since the tragic events of the holocaust. Oskar schindler, a nazi party member, used his pull within the party to save the lives of more than 1000 jewish individuals by recruiting them to work in his polish factory. Here are some facts about spielberg's groundbreaking film on its 25th anniversary. 1. The story was relayed to author thomas keneally in a beverly hills leather goods shop. In october 1980, australian novelist thomas keneally had stopped into a leather goods shop off of rodeo drive after a book tour stopover from a film festival in sorrento, italy, where one of his books was adapted into a movie. When the owner of the shop, leopold page, learned that keneally was a writer, he began telling him \"the greatest story of humanity man to man. \" that story was how page, his wife, and thousands of other jews were saved by a nazi factory owner named oskar schindler during world war ii. Page gave keneally photocopies of documents related to schindler, including speeches, firsthand accounts, testimonies, and the actual list of names of the people he saved. It inspired keneally to write the book schindler's ark, on which the movie is based. Page ( whose"

Specifically, boston researchers found that women who gave birth after age 33 were twice as likely to live to 95 than women who were done having kids at 29, reports medical daily. So what kind of effect should this have on a young couple's family planning? not much, the co-author of the study in the journal menopause tells the boston globe. \"women shouldn't delay child-bearing based on this study, \" says thomas perls. But he hopes it will get people to stop second-guessing women who become pregnant in middle age. \" critics say they ' ll be too old to care for their teens or help raise their grandchildren, \" says perls, \" but i would wager that these women are aging exceptionally well. \" one caveat: the extra longevity doesn't apply to women who use ivf or other technologies to get pregnant. So what's going on? researchers think that women who are able to get pregnant and conceive at older ages have \" genetic variants \" that slow down their own aging, reports counsel &amp; heal.

Now, an arrest in a case that has been major news in the netherlands and that involved a massive dna undertaking. The guardian reports that as the 20th anniversary of nicky's death approached, dutch officials in may 2017 put out a request: that roughly 20,000 men in the limburg area where nicky was killed submit their dna that october as part of a mass testing program. More than 14,000 did, reports the bbc. Jos brech was not among them: the nl times reports he left in october to hike in france's vosges mountains, reportedly telling his family he'd submit his dna upon his return. Except he didn't return, and his family reported him missing in april. But the dna trail still led to the 55-year-old survivalist and former scout leader. Dna that brech's relatives provided showed the killer — who left his dna on nicky's pajamas — was related to one of the donors, which helped authorities zero in on brech. They were able to recover a sample of his dna from his home and confirmed it was a match, which earned him a spot on europol's most wanted list last week. The guardian reports police received a tip from a dutch national who had seen the police photos and was visiting a commune-like community on the outskirts of castellterçol, spain, some 30 miles north of barcelona, that brech was there. He was arrested sunday and will be extradited to the netherlands. Brech's name was known to police: he was stopped two days after the murder while in the area and was questioned, but police deemed him no more than a passerby.

The democrat and chronicle reprints its two original articles about the case: bowie and three other people ( iggy pop, a bodyguard, and a rochester woman ) were allegedly found with about a half-pound of marijuana; bowie ( who gave police his actual last name, jones ) paid bond for all of them after they spent a few hours in jail. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment a few days later, and the charges were basically dismissed when a grand jury decided not to indict him in may. As buzzfeed explains, the ultra-glam mugshot wasn't taken in the wee hours of the morning bowie &amp; co. Were arrested, but rather when bowie arrived at his arraignment. The 28-year-old star walked \" silently... Through a crush of fans, police, and reporters \" — and about six suspected prostitutes also awaiting arraignment — on his way into court, ignoring everyone \" except for one teenager who got his autograph as he stepped off the escalator, \" the d&c article noted. As open culture recounts, bowie was \" looking dapper in his thin white duke clothing \" at the arraignment — \" a gray three-piece leisure suit and a pale brown shirt, \" with a \" matching hat \" that he carried, per the d&c. An auction house employee found the mugshot years later while going through a retired rochester police officer's estate, and his brother sold it on ebay for $ 2,700 in 2007.",

She had to be put on oxygen, \" and darren's like, ' it was out of focus; we've got to do it again. ' and i was just like, ' go f --- yourself. ' \" some of the crew ultimately made her an off-set \" kardashian tent \" where she could watch her beloved reality tv and escape from the darkness of the film, which comes out sept. 15. And yet despite all that, lawrence and aronofsky ended up dating after filming wrapped; they're still together a year later. Aronofsky lauds lawrence's \" raw, natural talent \" as being something akin to what michael jordan had going for him, while lawrence says that, after a year of interacting with the director as \" just a human, \" she recently watched the final cut of mother! and was reminded \" just how brilliant he is. \" he does not, however, understand her reality tv obsession — \" i wasn't involved in that, \" he says of the kardashian tent — which is a part of her personality he finds \" so vastly disappointing, \" lawrence says. Despite their age difference ( she is 26; he is 48 ), the relationship seems to work. \" i've been in relationships before where i am just confused. And i ' m never confused with him, \" lawrence says. But that's hardly all she discusses in the wide-ranging interview, which also covers the leak of her personal photos and hollywood's gender pay gap. Full interview here.",

        "summary": "Stacie dunn got called to her daughter stephanie's kentucky high school last week because she needed a scarf — not because the teen's neck was cold, but because the school said she was dressed inappropriately. Her offense: an exposed collarbone. Stephanie's wardrobe malfeasance is just the most recent flareup about woodford county high school's dress code, implemented in 2005 and protested by students ( one even made a documentary about it ) who say it's outdated and sexist, wtvq reports. The code mandates, among other things, that shorts and skirts fall to at least the knees, button-down shirts can only have the top button open, and shirt necklines can't go beneath the collarbone. School administrators, meanwhile, say the code provides an objective way for teachers to enforce appropriate attire without having to make judgment calls. \" the whole idea behind the dress code is to make sure you have a safe learning environment, \" the superintendent tells today.com. Gender-bias charges come in, according to dunn, because girls aren't allowed to show too much skin \" because it may distract their male class mates, \" which dunn calls \" ridiculous. \" in stephanie's case, even the scarf her mom brought wasn't enough to keep her in school because the principal reportedly didn't like how she wore it, though dunn admits stephanie also gave the principal \" attitude \" and has since apologized. One commenter on facebook writes, \" what [ was ] she supposed to wear?? do they expect you to break out a burka for school??? \" meanwhile, an amended dress code — which would allow crew-neck shirts and wide-strapped tank tops — was presented by the student who created the documentary at a monday night meeting at the school, lex 18 reports. Faculty say a committee will meet again sept. 21 and that any code changes won't take effect till january.

Chef rene redzepi is clearly among that group. When his noma restaurant in copenhagen received the first of four best restaurant in the world awards in 2010, redzepi hoped to bring his entire team to the award ceremony in london. Dishwasher ali sonko, however, couldn't make the trip, so his colleagues each wore a shirt depicting his face as they accepted the award, reports the bbc. When noma won again two years later, sonko was granted the honor of giving the acceptance speech. Now redzepi has found a new way to honor the 62-year-old dishwasher who has worked at noma since it opened 14 years ago: by making him a part owner. The surprise announcement came as noma closed its original location. Redzepi plans to launch a new restaurant and urban farm in a different neighborhood in december after first opening a pop-up restaurant in mexico, reports eater. \" it's great construction project, but what's it all worth if we do not have employees? \" says redzepi, per the copenhagen post. \" ali is noma's soul. \" in addition to sonko — who has 12 children and is originally from gambia — noma manager james spreadbury and service director lau richter were also named as partners in a move redzepi described as \" one of the happiest moments of my time at noma. \" other employees will receive \" a piece of the walls \" of the original noma location, redzepi writes on instagram.

Legal experts doubt it will work, but is it right? is it smart politics? does it even make sense? here's what people are saying: \" the prince of orange is mostly right about the problem, if not the time frame, \" writes dana milbank at the washington post — the executive branch has been gaining power \" for a generation or more. \" but that's because congress'dysfunction has created a power vacuum, and boehner actively perpetuates that dysfunction. He should try legislating instead of litigating. Besides, \" obama is a pretty bad dictator, \" arit john at the atlantic wire observes. Despite the republican perception that \" king obama i was trying to govern without congress, \" obama is actually on pace to issue fewer executive orders per term than any of the past three presidents. But, as philip bump at the washington post points out, obama has taken a lot of executive actions, a broader term including things like official memos and instructions to departments. It's executive actions that boehner is objecting too, and \" that's a much different — and much bigger — battle. \" nbc news sees this as a political move designed \" to prove to the gop base that party leaders in washington are prepared to throw the kitchen sink \" at obama ahead of the midterms. The wall street journal applauds boehner, arguing that obama's \" flagrant contempt for regular political order \" is so egregious that the speaker had to involve the courts. \" far from a partisan caper, this implicates the foundation of the us political architecture, \" its editors write. And they're guessing boehner's case isn't as dubious as it's being portrayed. \" we doubt he'd wager the house's reputation, and his own, on a novelty lawsuit that the courts wouldn't hesitate to toss as frivolous. \"",

What they're saying: theron, who gained 50 pounds for the role of marlo, delivers a \" bold, gutsy, glamour-free performance \" — her best since 2011's young adult, also from cody and reitman, writes adam graham at the detroit news. Equally refreshing is the film itself. It's a \" gloves-off comic-drama about the pressures and difficulties of motherhood … that is rare in its brutal honesty, \" graham says. Cody wrote the film after having her third child, \" and the fact that this is such a personal story shines through from the very beginning, \" writes christy lemire at rogerebert.com. \" it's at once intimately detailed and narratively ambitious. And it's surprisingly profound, sneaking up on you with understated yet wholly earned emotion by the end. \" theron and mackenzie davis as tully are both good, lemire adds. \" they have tremendous chemistry from the get-go. \" but it's theron who \" holds the movie in her hands and gives it to us like a gift; one we accept with joy, \" writes moira macdonald at the seattle times. \" her marlo, tough and smart and pushed nearly to the breaking point, is someone we know; maybe someone we were, \" she adds, calling the film an \" ode to motherhood and tart reminder that it isn't all smiles and sunshine. \" tully \" transforms itself from a garden-variety tale of harried parenthood into something stranger, more honest and even magical, \" writes michael o'sullivan at the washington post. While he doesn't give away how this happens — \" it involves one of filmdom's great bits of storytelling trickery \" — he says \" the choice is a bold and thrilling one. \"",

        "summary": "A long-range study on how parents discipline their kids shows a clear trend: spanking is down and time-outs are up. The georgetown researchers looked specifically at national surveys involving mothers with kindergarten-age kids and found that modern parents across all income levels report spanking their children less than their counterparts in 1988, reports live science. For example, the percentage of average-income mothers who endorsed the idea of spanking dropped from 46 % in 1988 to 21 % in 2011. At the same time, the overall percentage of mothers who backed non-physical time-out punishments rose from 41 % to 81 %. One researcher not involved with the study cautions that what parents say they do may be different than what they actually do inside their home. Still, \" parents seem to be using more reasoning and nonphysical discipline strategies with children, which is in line with what the american academy of pediatrics recommended in 1998, \" says lead researcher rebecca ryan, per healthday. Generally speaking, the lower the income, the more likely mothers were to endorse physical discipline. About a third of those in the bottom 10 % of incomes backed the idea in 2011, and 25 % had actually spanked their kids in the previous week. Still, the researchers say in the american academy of pediatrics that \" changes have occurred at all socioeconomic levels, producing for some behaviors a significant reduction in socioeconomic differences. \" ( a previous study mades the case that spanking backfires in terms of discipline. )",

        "summary": "President trump's first budget proposal appears to have little chance of getting past the people who actually control federal spending. The sweeping spending cutbacks were denounced as extreme thursday even by trump's republican allies in congress. The cuts to domestic programs are \" draconian, careless, and counterproductive, \" rep. Hal rogers, former chair of the house appropriations committee, said in a statement. \" we will certainly review this budget proposal, but congress ultimately has the power of the purse. \" the washington post interviewed several gop lawmakers and found that while they were ok with the concept of funding increased military spending with cuts elsewhere, none would endorse the trump budget. A roundup of coverage: the wall street journal reports that some of trump's deepest proposed cuts would hit the areas where his support is strongest. He wants to scrap funding for the appalachian regional commission, an agency fighting poverty across a region where 399 out of 420 counties chose trump over hillary clinton. Paul ryan described trump's proposal as just the beginning of the budget process. \" do i think we can cut spending and get waste out of government? absolutely, \" the house speaker said. \" where and how and what numbers, that's something we ' ll be figuring out as time goes on. \" sen. John mccain gave a blunt assessment of the proposal's chances in the senate, the hill reports. \" it is clear that this budget proposed today cannot pass the senate, \" he said, adding that whatever plan congress comes up with must include enough money to \" rebuild the military. \" politico lists six surprises it found in the trump budget, including increasing funding for the census bureau and for dealing with the opioid addiction crisis. Researchers weren't expecting much from trump's budget, but they were still taken aback by the scale of the proposed cuts, the new york times reports. \" as to climate change, i think the president was fairly straightforward: we're not spending money on that anymore, \" white house budget director mick mulvaney said. Medical research was also cut in a move denounced by the american society of clinical oncology. \" now is not the time to slow progress in finding new treatments and cures for patients with cancer, \" the association of cancer specialists said in a statement. The san francisco chronicle reports that one of the cuts causing the most anger is the proposal to strip meals on wheels of federal funding. The group described cuts as \" exasperating, \" though most of its funding comes from corporate and individual donations. Marketwatch columnist diana furchtgott-roth has",

The problem-plagued musical has also been delayed yet again, this time until \"early summer 2011, \" according to the show's blog. Taymor has been replaced with philip william mckinley, who directed the boy from oz, and the script will be revised by roberto aguirre-sacasa, who has written for the spider-man comic books. Despite the official party line ( taymor's \"previous commitments \" make her unable to stay with the show now that it's been delayed for the sixth time ), friends and colleagues tell the new york times she was actually pushed out after all the negative reviews came out last month, and because she refused to make changes to the show. Another source tells the new york daily news that bono himself, who wrote the score along with u2 bandmate the edge, wanted taymor out, presumably because she hired a non-u2 musical consultant to help with the score.",

Counterfeiting has taken off in the country, which has overtaken colombia as the largest source of fake us currency in the last two years, the ap reports. The phony money typically finds its way into the us, argentina, venezuela, or ecuador, via false-bottom suitcases, books, and food; it's even ingested. Over the past decade, $ 103 million in fake us dollars \" made in peru \" have been seized — nearly half since 2010. \" it's much more profitable than cocaine, \" an investigator says, noting that after expenses a counterfeiter can earn $ 20,000 in real money for every $ 100,000 in fake bills; three times that amount can be produced in 5 days. One thing that sets peru apart is its process: while most other counterfeiters use sophisticated inkjet printers, peruvians finish each bill by hand. \" once a note is printed they will throw five people ( on it ) and do little things, little touches that add to the quality, \" says a secret service agent. Still, the bills do have what globalpost calls a \" fatal flaw \": they're made from low-quality paper that comes apart when exposed to water.

        "summary": "The city of stockton, calif., will today file for bankruptcy, becoming the largest city in the us ever to do so, the san francisco chronicle reports. Stockton, a river port and agricultural city of nearly 300,000 about 90 miles east of san francisco, became a victim of california's housing crash. During the mid-2000s economic boom, the city — long mired in poverty — attempted to reinvent itself, building a new marina and sports complex, fancy hotel, new housing tracts, and promenade on credit. Today, those posh areas are blocks away from dangerous, violent neighborhoods, the los angeles times reports, and the rate of foreclosure is the second-highest in the nation. \" all that's left is sadness, \" said the town's retired fire chief after last night's 6-1 council vote in favor of bankruptcy. The city cut the police department by 25 % — and last year saw a record-setting 58 homicides; there have been 31 so far this year, the bbc reports. The fire department was cut by 30 %, and other city employees by 40 %. Employee pay and benefits, once perhaps overly generous, were also cut. Stockton also has the state's second-highest rate of violent crime and an unemployment rate higher than 15 %. Many city buildings have been repossessed, including city hall. \" wells fargo bank took over a few parking garages that the city owned, \" says one local. \" now they own the building city hall is in. You might well call it wells fargo town. \"",

His story instantly went viral, he started work on a book with malcolm gladwell's literary agent, and actor russell brand even joked that he \" looks a lot like jesus. \" but there appears to be more to the story, and price may be more shrewd than purely altruistic. Bloomberg business reporter karen weise, over the course of profiling price's decision to raise salaries across the board, learned that price's brother and gravity shareholder lucas price served him with a lawsuit before the april pay hike announcement, on march 16, alleging \" burdensome, harsh and wrongful \" actions. So while dan price has suggested that the lawsuit is the result of the pay hike — lucas price stands to earn less because more profits are going toward salaries — it may actually have been a brilliant marketing move to make dan price out to be the good guy and thus help his chances of beating the lawsuit. The suit also asks that dan price buy out lucas'shares, but with less profit, that's tougher to do. Oh, and dan price told weise that he was served two weeks after he made the announcement. Dan price's response to her questions about the inconsistency between court records and his version of the timing? \" i am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise. \" ( he repeated this four times. ) he has, however, denied allegations about to be made public by his former wife through tedx that he beat and even waterboarded her during their marriage. In a statement to the guardian, the company said weise put forth \" reckless accusations and baseless speculations that are unequivocally false. \"",

There's also the possibility of expanding a tracking system for homeless people, new centers for them to store belongings and use social services, and anti-poverty measures, says garcetti.

The case revealed chilling texts in which the couple talked about the beatings and at times seemed to make light of them. In one, the girl's mother wrote that she was ready to perform \" soren-cide \" because her daughter was apparently misbehaving. Phillip gleason's defense argued that the iraq war veteran was suffering ptsd and traumatic brain injury, which the prosecuting attorney called a \" slap in the face to every veteran. \" phillip gleason took photos and video of the injured girl, writing in one text, \" she will suffer my rules, \" and in another, \" i just knocked the [ expletive ] out of her, \" per the herald. Authorities say soren's mother made no attempt to stop the beatings, even buying cream to cover up the injuries, reports the charlotte observer. She says she is \" not a monster \" and that soren was the \" joy \" of her life. One of the first responders who held soren's hand as she died choked up when asked to describe the girl's injuries during sentencing. \" soren endured a living hell, \" he said.

( 1: 29 ) paris -- serena williams called off her grand slam comeback because of a chest muscle injury on monday, pulling out of the french open shortly before she was supposed to play maria sharapova in the fourth round. \" it's extremely disappointing, \" williams said during a news conference at roland garros. \" but also, i made a promise to myself and to my coach and to my team that if i ' m not at least 60 percent or 50 percent, then i probably shouldn't play. \" williams, who has won 23 grand slam singles titles, said she can't serve because of a problem with her right pectoral muscle. Her voice trembled a bit as she explained that she will get an mri and consult with doctors before figuring out what she will do next. Her coach, patrick mouratoglou, said in an interview that an ultrasound revealed the injury to the muscle, but the extent wasn't clear. \" the fact that i physically can't serve at all is a good indication that maybe i should just go back to the drawing board and stay positive, \" williams said, \" and try to get better and not get it to a point where it could be a lot worse. \" williams, 36, was competing at a major tournament for the first time in 16 months -- and for the first time since giving birth to her daughter last september. Williams said her chest began hurting in her third-round singles victory over 11th-seeded julia goerges on saturday. \" it was really painful, \" williams said, \" and i didn't know what it was. \" despite that, williams played in a doubles loss alongside her sister venus on sunday and tried to limit the pain by taping up the muscle. But nothing was effective enough that williams thought she could continue in paris. Her withdrawal allows sharapova, a two-time french open champion, to move into the quarterfinals.

Netflix says that's because they typically face slower network connections, rather than overcharge fees, once they've hit their data limit.

        "summary": "Police in north carolina have arrested a 31-year-old man accused of the creepy crime of sucking a woman's toes in walmart, reports the smoking gun. How did he manage it? fox carolina reports that michael brown allegedly convinced a woman shopping for shoes that he was an aspiring foot doctor and could help her find the perfect pair. \" at one point the suspect took the victim's foot, put it into his mouth and sucked the victim's toes, \" says the police report. When the woman rebuffed him, he got nervous and offered to pay for her groceries, she says. A detective in lincolnton tells the new york daily news that brown tried a similar trick on a woman at a different walmart, telling her he was conducting a survey of women's feet. She got away from him before anything happened. It turns out that brown is on the state's list of registered sex offenders over a 2001 conviction of a similar nature. He got out of prison for that one in 2004. After his arrest yesterday, brown remains in custody on assault charges.",

A million copies of grey — essentially fifty shades of grey told from the perspective of bdsm's most notorious fictional fan, christian grey — are now available on bookshelves all because james says fans \" asked … and asked … and asked \" for a look into grey's head. The title was already the top pre-order book of the year on amazon's kindle, and the ebook version released at midnight is currently no. 1. James only announced the book in an instagram post earlier this month, exposing what reuters calls \" one of the best-kept secrets of publishing. \" james claims \" christian might have some surprises in store \" for fans, but the book doesn't live up to that claim, reports the ap. It starts with a flashback to grey's childhood before he meets virginal student anastasia steele and wonders how her skin might look \" pink and warmed from the bite of a cane. \" he also reveals he ran a background check on her, per the guardian. Oh, and there's plenty of praise for steele's sexual prowess in what the ap calls driving \" him lustily nuts \" over the way she bites her bottom lip.

        "summary": "The 2004 disaster film the day after tomorrow depicted a world devastated by climate change — including tornadoes, flooding, and, surprisingly, a modern ice age that freezes the northern hemisphere. All hollywood exaggeration, right? scientists said so at the time, but now a professor has run the film's basic theory through a respected climate model and produced interesting results, says science world report. In the movie, a major northward current in the atlantic ocean collapses and spawns environmental havoc. And while the collapse of this current — called the atlantic meridional overturning circulations ( amoc ) — is unlikely, it would apparently cause global cooling, even if global warming continues at its current rate. This according to sybren drijfhout, a professor from england who ran the idea through the \" the max-planck institute's state-of-the-art climate model, \" tech times reports. Seems a 20-year collapse of amoc would cause global cooling, at least for a while: \" the planet earth recovers from the amoc collapse in about 40 years when global warming continues at present-day rates, but near the eastern boundary of the north atlantic ( including the british isles ) it takes more than a century before temperature is back to normal, \" he says, per a press release. Published in scientific reports, drijfhout's study describes heat flow between the ocean and the atmosphere, which some have used to explain the recent \" climate hiatus \" or relative reduction in global warming temperatures. ( yet \" off the chart \" temperatures are still breaking records worldwide. )",

The $ 3.99 trillion plan for the budget year that begins oct. 1 is founded on higher taxes both for the wealthy and corporations; some money will come from closing loopholes, usa today reports. The budget aims \" to bring middle-class economics into the 21st century, \" the white house says. Among its key points: that $ 3.99 trillion in spending meets with projected revenues of $ 3.53 trillion, for a deficit of $ 474 billion, or 2.5 % of gdp. The ap reports the plan doesn't zero out the deficit over the next decade, but the administration maintains that various actions on health care, immigration, and taxes would trim the deficits by about $ 1.8 trillion over that period, leaving the red ink at manageable levels. Indeed, the goal is a \" sustainable \" deficit below 3 % of gdp, politico reports. Companies like general electric and microsoft would face a one-time 14 % tax on what's thought to be $ 2.1 trillion in profits \" piled up abroad, \" reuters reports; firms would owe 19 % on foreign profits in the future. Sequestration spending ceilings would end, usa today reports, and domestic and military spending would climb by 7 %, with infrastructure and education seeing benefits. Some $ 3 billion would go to science and math education. The bill would also cover two years'tuition for some community college students at a cost of $ 60 billion over 10 years. Also put forward: an up-to-$ 3,000 child care tax credit. The plan also puts forward $ 14 billion for upping cybersecurity, proposes paid-leave programs, and calls for $ 1 billion put toward a \" fully democratic \" central america. Though much of the plan will be distasteful to republicans, obama has included significant boosts for gop priorities like defense, politico reports, calling the bill an \" opening bid in a long hostage negotiation. \"",

        "summary": "Yawning doesn't mean you're bored, it just means you've got one big, hot brain in your head, according to a study published tuesday in biology letters. The atlantic reports researcher andrew gallup had his students go online to collect videos of animals yawning ( not a hard task considering yawning animals are the dang cutest ). He then found he was able to predict the brain weight and the number of brain cells in the cortexes of various animals based on their yawn length. \"we were just really blown out of the water, \" gallup tells the atlantic. \"it's such a strong predictor. \" perhaps surprisingly, body and mouth size had nothing to do with yawn length. The explanation for brain size correlating to yawn length comes from a theory first proposed by gallup in 2007, stat reports. He argues animals yawn to cool their brains, according to the washington post. If that's true, it stands to reason that larger brains would require a larger yawn to cool. And it explains why humans ' yawns, at 6.5 seconds, are the longest yawns in the animal kingdom, beating out those of gorillas, lions, elephants, and more. However, not all scientists are convinced yawning serves a cooling function, and some point to its contagiousness as evidence of a sociological function. Gallup isn't swayed. \"whether yawning functions specifically to cool the brain can still be debated, but there is no debate on whether yawning has thermoregulatory consequences, \" he says. ( men are less likely to catch a yawn. )",

Yawning might also kick the brain out of its so-called default mode — a sort of background humming-along state — and into a paying-attention state by increasing the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, a 2014 paper found.

        "summary": "\" for them, halloween truly is a night of horrors, \" says an activist and attorney who's filed a lawsuit in california. The horror janice bellucci is fighting: that of a chula vista sex offender whose rights she says are being violated by having to participate in a statewide program that keeps trick-or-treaters away from sex offenders ' homes on halloween, the los angeles times reports. As part of operation boo, an initiative run by the state's department of corrections and rehabilitation for more than 20 years, local law enforcement does sweeps on known sex offenders on oct. 31 to make sure they're complying with special restrictions, including a 12-hour curfew in which they must stay indoors; a ban on halloween decorations, candy, and outdoor lighting that may attract kids; and opening their doors only for law enforcement. Bellucci's biggest bone of contention, however, are signs like \" sorry, no candy \" that she says sex offenders must post to alert kids to stay away. She tells ktxl the signs not only violate sex offenders ' first amendment rights by \" compelling \" them to speak about their status — the signs also put them ( and the people they live with ) in harm's way. \" people who are on the registry do not have the right to posses a firearm, much less to use one, so really they are sitting ducks, \" she tells the station. Although there's no mention of the signs on the program's site — and a rep tells the times they're not mandated — bellucci says the requirement exists in san diego county, a fact she says she confirmed with her client's parole officer. She adds to the times of san diego, \" the facts are, there are no reports in california of a sexual assault upon a child who goes trick-or-treating. \" but at least one registered offender who spoke to nbc san diego doesn't have a beef with the signs. \" i kind of understand where they're coming from, \" he says. \" it helps keep [ kids ] away so there's less chance of children saying something happened. \"",

The controller can later be heard telling the delta captain to report his mistake. \" just knowing that there were two aircraft of that size headed to the same intersection at the same time … this could have been catastrophic, \" a commercial pilot tells cbs chicago.

Knowing the house would need to be torn down — only licensed contractors who had signed a legal waiver were allowed inside — phares listed it for $ 200,000, or $ 25,000 less than a nearby vacant lot recently sold for. The result was a bidding war. Phares got 41 offers from developers and homebuyers over the next 10 days. A development firm ended up buying the 65-year-old home for $ 427,000. And if any of that sounds vaguely evil, at least for prospective home buyers, the seattle times also reports the median home price in seattle last month was a \" devilish \" $ 666,500. That's a 15.9 % increase over last year and an incredible 74 % increase since 2011. Home prices are rising faster in seattle than almost anywhere else in the us. And according to my northwest, there's no evidence they ' ll reverse course anytime soon with high demand and relatively few homes. Phares says he thinks bidders are \" just taking hail marys \" on properties at this point. \"that's not sound, and that's not sustainable, \" he tells the times.

According to the telegraph, the civil engineering student at the university of west london was trapped in his apartment on the 14th floor of the 24-story building after getting separated from his older brother, omar. His brother made it out of grenfell and was being treated for smoke inhalation, but not mohammad. \" he survived assad, he survived the war, only to be killed in a tower block in london, \" says a friend. Officials have confirmed that 17 people have died so far in the massive blaze that consumed the public-housing tower tuesday night, though, officials believe the death toll could rise into the hundreds. As for the reports that residents fruitlessly complained about fire safety concerns, the guardian has some more specifics: among other things, they complained about the placement of pipes and boilers, the absence of a fire-alarm or sprinkler system, and piles of trash in common areas.",

Epidemiologists in new york city are using information from the craig spencer's metrocard and credit cards to help trace his movements, reports the guardian.

It would be possible to get ebola from a bowling ball if someone \" left blood, vomit, or feces on a bowling ball, and the next person to touch it did not even notice, and then put his fingers into his eyes, nose, or mouth, \" he writes, but mucus and saliva aren't highly infectious until a patient is much too ill to even consider bowling.

        "summary": "Cyberbullying is a huge problem among teens — and an alarming new study finds that sometimes, kids inflict the bullying on themselves. Researchers surveyed almost 5,600 us students between the ages of 12 and 17, and around 6 % reported they had engaged in what researchers are calling \" self-cyberbullying \" or \" digital self-harm, \" per a press release. That means those children had anonymously posted hurtful content about themselves, or sent themselves hurtful messages to which they could then respond; it can happen via texting, email, social media, video games, web forums, and more, healthday reports. \" it's a new phenomenon, and this is definitely happening, \" the study's lead author, sameer hinduja, tells usa today. Boys are more likely to engage in the practice, with 7 % reporting they'd done so compared with 5 % of girls. Nearly half of the children who'd engaged in digital self-harm gave reasons ranging from wanting attention to a desire to appear victimized so they could justify bullying others. Some reported feeling self-hate, depression, or having suicidal thoughts; others said they were bored or did it in an attempt to make fun of themselves. The biggest risk factor for self-cyberbullying was having been a victim of cyberbullying or in-person bullying from others in the past; other risk factors included identifying as gay, having depression symptoms, having engaged in physical self-harm, having stolen something or seriously hurt someone else physically, and having used illicit drugs. The research was partly inspired by the suicides of an english 14-year-old and a texas 15-year-old who'd been harassed online; in both cases, officials ultimately found they'd sent themselves harassing messages, study co-author justin patchin explains in a blog post.",

Republican bevin wins kentucky governor's race matt bevin's triumph comes less than 2 years after an embarrassing defeat against mitch mcconnell. Republican matt bevin easily won kentucky's governorship on tuesday as the gop made major inroads in a state that had stubbornly resisted the party at the state level even as it voted reliably republican in federal contests in recent years. Bevin, a self-funding investment manager, rode a late surge of outside support from national republicans to defeat democrat jack conway, 53 percent to 44 percent, according to the associated press. Bevin will become just the second republican to inhabit the governor's mansion in frankfort in more than four decades. Story continued below polls prior to the vote showed a close race, with most surveys giving conway, the state's sitting attorney general, a slight advantage. Bevin's victory capped a successful night for republicans, who picked up four of the six independently elected statewide positions despite going into tuesday with just one gop officeholder. Their victories included ousting state auditor adam edelen, who was thought to be democrats'top pick to challenge gop sen. Rand paul next year. It also marked a stunning political turnaround for bevin, who has spent $ 7 million trying to win elected office between this run and his failed 2014 senate primary against now-majority leader mitch mcconnell. In 2014, he lost the primary to mcconnell by 25 percentage points and was mocked by fellow republicans as an \" east coast con man \" and a supporter of cockfighting. He entered the governor's race just hours before the filing deadline and won a may primary against two more establishment-oriented republicans by a mere 83 votes. Mcconnell even took to the senate floor on wednesday morning to congratulate his one-time rival. \" i remember when the republican nomination was hardly worth having in kentucky, \" mcconnell said. \" we used to have to beg people to run. So it says something when we see spirited competition for it, which we had in the primary back in may. The governor-elect and i certainly are no strangers to spirited competition, but we're also conservative kentuckians happy to see some change coming to frankfort. \""

In 2014, he lost the primary to mcconnell by 25 percentage points and was mocked by fellow republicans as an \" east coast con man \" and a supporter of cockfighting. He entered the governor's race just hours before the filing deadline and won a may primary against two more establishment-oriented republicans by a mere 83 votes. Mcconnell even took to the senate floor on wednesday morning to congratulate his one-time rival. \" i remember when the republican nomination was hardly worth having in kentucky, \" mcconnell said. \" we used to have to beg people to run. So it says something when we see spirited competition for it, which we had in the primary back in may. The governor-elect and i certainly are no strangers to spirited competition, but we're also conservative kentuckians happy to see some change coming to frankfort. \"",

He's hit a wide range of topics, but one tweet in particular drawing attention is actually a retweet of a supporter's eclipse joke. It shows an image of trump gradually coming closer to one of president obama, until trump's finally replaces it. \" the best eclipse ever! \" is the caption. On other topics: mitch mcconnell: trump addressed reports of his supposedly sour relations with the senate majority leader, tweeting that \" the only problem i have with mitch mcconnell is that, after hearing repeal &amp; replace for 7 years, he failed! that should never have happened! \" different messages: he mocked the \" fake news \" in two tweets for calling attention to the different tones of his recent speeches. \" well, there was afghanistan ( somber ), the big rally ( enthusiastic, dynamic and fun ) and the american legion - v.a. ( respectful and strong ). Too bad the dems have no one who can change tones! \" james clapper: he went after the former national intelligence director, who on wednesday questioned trump's fitness for office. \" james clapper, who famously got caught lying to congress, is now an authority on donald trump. Will he show you his beautiful letter to me? \" he wrote. Debt ceiling: trump blamed mcconnell and paul ryan for the looming problem because he says they refused his request to tie legislation for an increase in the ceiling to a veterans affairs bill that easily passed. \" they didn't do it so now we have a big deal with dems holding them up ( as usual ) on debt ceiling approval. Could have been so easy-now a mess! \" he wrote.

On april 15, a goose flew into a transformer, bringing down electrical lines and trapping the bus. Authorities say the driver, 60-year-old patricia ryan, asked if one of the five students onboard would get out and move a power line off the bus. The 11-year-old, identified by wtae as tyler cunningham, volunteered. But when he grabbed the power line, it burned his hand. \" it shocked me, \" he says. \" it got me like right there, on the thumb. \" tyler got back on the bus, and ryan asked him multiple times if he was ok. But when authorities arrived to free the bus, ryan allegedly kept mum on the student's injury. The school district later learned of the incident. Which was caught on security video and by the bus's radio, from the other students who had been onboard. The school removed ryan as a bus driver, and she has since been charged with endangering the welfare of a child and reckless endangerment. Tyler's parents want her license taken away, as well, the new york daily news reports. \" i never intended to hurt anyone, \" ryan tells the tribune-review.",

According to rt, the bipartisan bill, which passed the judiciary committee in january, would tweak the 1976 foreign sovereign immunities act, nullifying the immunity granted to some countries when terror attacks in the us are involved. If passed, the bill could allow the families of sept. 11 victims to bring the saudi royal family and saudi charities, who they believe funded the attacks, to court. Saudi arabia claims it would need to sell its us assets if the bill is passed, lest the us government freeze them. Some economists are skeptical the saudi government would follow through on the threat, as it would destroy its economy. The obama administration, warning it could lead to legal retaliations by other countries, has been trying to stop congress from passing the bill. It's a move that's upsetting some families of sept. 11 victims. \"it's stunning to think that our government would back the saudis over its own citizens, \" the times quotes a woman whose husband died in the world trade center as saying. Meanwhile, obama is also deciding whether or not to declassify 28 pages of a 2002 report allegedly containing information tying saudi officials to the sept. 11 attacks, fox news reports.
