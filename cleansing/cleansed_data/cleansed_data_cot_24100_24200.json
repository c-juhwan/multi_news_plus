        "summary": "\" bad choices were made, \" said st. Louis county police chief jon belmar in a morning press conference following last night's police shooting of a teen in berkeley, mo., a town bordering ferguson. \" this individual could have complied, he could have ran away, he could have dropped the gun, \" says belmar, who declined to id the dead 18-year-old. But belmar did describe the victim, a black male named by local media as antonio martin, as being \" known to law enforcement \" due to prior weapons and stealing charges. Some footage taken by surveillance cameras at the mobil station where the shooting occurred has now been released. The video does not show the shooting itself, ending at the point where the suspect allegedly draws his weapon. ( abc news describes it as \" inconclusive, captured from the side of the building a considerable distance away. \" ) belmar says the deceased \" produced a pistol with his arm straight out, pointing it straight at the officer kind of from across the hood, \" per the st. Louis post-dispatch. The officer then fired \" what we think is three shots, \" says belmar, who notes one round struck the suspect. A \" defaced \" 9mm gun was recovered and contained five rounds in the magazine and one round in the chamber. Belmar said the 34-year-old officer in question is a white male and a six-year veteran of the berkeley force who was responding to a report of a theft. His dashboard cam was likely not on because it's activated by the police cruiser's red lights, which were off, says belmar; the chief adds that the officer had been handed a body camera during his shift but wasn't believed to be wearing it. Belmar says st. Louis county prosecuting attorney bob mcculloch has assigned a prosecutor to the case.",

Ahead of sunday's anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, the new york times spoke to judge alvin k. Hellerstein, who oversaw civil lawsuits filed by the family members of dozens of 9/11 victims. None of the cases ever went to trial and although some families wanted to hold the airlines and others accountable and air information in public instead of reaching a settlement, the judge says he has no regrets about the outcome. In other coverage: in his weekly address on saturday, president obama praised the country's resilience and vowed that \" america will never give in to fear, \" the guardian reports. \" we're still the america of heroes who ran into harm's way, of ordinary folks who took down the hijackers, of families who turned their pain into hope, \" said the president, who will deliver remarks at a pentagon memorial service on sunday. Npr speaks to vaughn allex, a former american airlines ticket agent who has been haunted for 15 years by the fact that he checked in two of the hijackers who arrived late for their flight at dulles international airport. They crashed the plane into the pentagon and allex says he blamed himself for the attack for many years and he has never been able to get over the guilt. Nbc news looks at new york city's only homicide on 9/11 that was unrelated to the attacks. The nypd could only spare one officer that day to investigate the shooting death of recent polish immigrant henryk siwiak. Investigators still hope to crack the case someday. Time looks at the story behind falling man, one of the most haunting photos from 9/11. The man seen falling from the twin towers has never been identified. The new york daily news reports that a mattress store in texas says it will be closed indefinitely amid the backlash from a tasteless 9/11 ad. Miracle mattress owner mike bonanno says there will be \" accountability actions \" for those behind the ad. He says the company will make a donation to a memorial fund. The cbc looks at the \" 9/11 truth \" conspiracy theories, which are still going strong 15 years after the attacks. Analysts say such movements tend to thrive in times of uncertainty.",

According to wtvr, 26-year-old mohamed jalloh, a us citizen from sierra leone, joined the army national guard in 2009; he was honorably discharged in 2015. He allegedly quit after hearing a lecture from a radical muslim cleric. The fbi believes jalloh first made contact with isis during a trip to west africa in 2015, nbc washington reports. An investigation into jalloh started in march after an isis member introduced jalloh to a government informant posing as an isis operative. That isis member, now dead, was planning an attack in the us and believed jalloh and the informant would help. In april, jalloh allegedly told the informant he was thinking about conducting an attack similar to the one on fort hood in 2009, saying he wanted to do a \" nidal hasan type of thing. \" officials say that same month he was asked by isis if he wanted to take part in an attack and responded, \" i really want to. \" \" sometimes you just have to take action, \" nbc quotes jalloh as allegedly saying during a recorded conversation. In may, officials say jalloh told the informant he wanted to plan an attack for ramadan, which ended tuesday, and tried to send $ 500 to isis. He was seen buying an assault rifle on saturday ( the gun was disabled before it left the store ). Jalloh's arrest was the culmination of a three-month sting.

Per a study published in plos one, these proteins are like replicas of a person's dna, which is more prone to degradation over time and due to exposure; plus, the dna found in hair is of the mitochondrial kind ( originating only from the mother ) instead of the nuclear kind ( from both parents ). By adding this type of testing to one's forensics arsenal, we could soon see hair protein testing take the place of dna testing not only on shows like bones, but also in real-life labs. \" currently forensic science is very dependent on dna, \" lead author glendon parker tells popular science. \" but analyzing proteins can add information that can help make a case stronger. \" the scientists looked at hair samples from 76 men and women ( 66 of european descent, five from kenya, and five african americans ) and six sets of remains from the 18th and 19th centuries and discovered nearly 200 protein markers that could differentiate one person from another. When they then compared the protein ids to those culled from dna in subjects ' blood, they made a match 98.3 % of the time. It takes less than three days to do a hair protein analysis and will likely cost about as much as dna testing, the researchers say. Drawbacks to this experiment: the study's small sample size, as well as the fact that a large chunk of hair is currently needed to do an analysis, the washington post and quartz report. But researchers are hopeful for its potential. \" i don't think it's an overstatement to say it could be a game-changer, \" says christopher hopkins, director of the forensic science graduate program at the university of california-davis.

            "Human identification from biological material is largely dependent on the ability to characterize genetic polymorphisms in dna. Unfortunately, dna can degrade in the environment, sometimes below the level at which it can be amplified by pcr. Protein however is chemically more robust than dna and can persist for longer periods. Protein also contains genetic variation in the form of single amino acid polymorphisms. These can be used to infer the status of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism alleles. To demonstrate this, we used mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics to characterize hair shaft proteins in 66 european-american subjects. A total of 596 single nucleotide polymorphism alleles were correctly imputed in 32 loci from 22 genes of subjects'dna and directly validated using sanger sequencing. Estimates of the probability of resulting individual non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism allelic profiles in the european population, using the product rule, resulted in a maximum power of discrimination of 1 in 12,500.",

            "President obama and first lady michelle obama earned just over $ 600,000 in 2012, far less than they took in during 2011, according to their tax return, released by the white house on friday. The obamas reported an adjusted gross income of $ 608,611 during the election year, more than $ 180,000 less than they grossed for the previous year. They paid $ 112,214 in federal taxes, an effective rate of 18.4 percent. In 2011, they paid an effective tax rate of 19.2 percent. The release of the first couple's tax return comes with far less fanfare than a year ago, when the president spent the week before tax day advocating for the buffett rule, which would set a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on those earning more than $ 1 million annually. The obama campaign quickly followed up on the release of the returns of the president and vice president joe biden by calling on republican presidential candidate mitt romney to release his tax returns, something he resisted doing throughout the campaign. This time around, though, the closest thing to controversy is the president's commitment to write a check back to the treasury department for five percent of his $ 400,000 salary, in a sign of support for federal employees facing furloughs because of sequestration. Biden, who grossed just over half of what the president did, has said he will share the pain of sequestration that his office's staff face, but has not yet detailed what that would mean. ( also on politico: obama's top 5 fights with his base ) the drop in the obamas ' income last year is largely due to smaller earnings from sales of the president's books, from $ 441,000 in 2011 to $ 259,000 in 2012. With the fall in income came smaller charitable contributions in 2012. In all, the obamas gave just over $ 150,000 -- 24.6 percent of their gross -- to 33 charities. The biggest single contribution was $ 103,871 to the fisher house foundation, to which the president has committed to contribute proceeds",

In accordance with the legislation that i signed into law last december, i have certified and notified congress that the requirements for repeal have been met. 'don't ask, don't tell ' will end, once and for all, in 60 days — on september 20, 2011.

Or trying to report, as he bursts into uncontrollable laughter just a few seconds into the taping. \" burning behind me is 8-1/2 tons of heroin, opium, hashish, and other narcotics, \" he says in the most serious voice he can muster, before the smoke overtakes him and he emits a high-pitched, manic-sounding giggle. The cameraman can't help chuckling with him as he tries ( unsuccessfully ) two more times to wrap up his report. The video, which sommerville called \" don't inhale, \" was believed to have been shot in an undetermined location in the middle east, news.com.au reports. The now-deleted tweet ( said to have been taken down due to copyright issues, the telegraph reports ) reportedly read, \" dear tweeps, it's been a year of bullets &amp; bloodshed. You've earned a xmas laugh, at my expense. \" a bbc spokesman tells the telegraph that sommerville put the video up \" in the spirit of a blooper \" and that \" it was filmed four years ago — it hasn't been seen before and was never broadcast. \" it's not the first time sommerville has attempted to add levity to his often super-serious stint: yesterday he tweeted a photo of a suitcase stuffed with tea cakes, christmas ornaments, and earl grey tea, commenting, \" i ' m often asked by celebrity magazines, etc, what i pack for my travels in war zones.

        "summary": "The modern american spends too much time staring at screens and not enough socializing — right? that's what popular books like bowling alone and alone together have argued, but rutgers professor keith hampton put that theory to the test by filming people in public spaces, the new york times magazine reports. In fact, he filmed public spaces in new york, philadelphia, and boston where a sociologist had filmed in the 1960s and ' 70s, and compared the two. And lo and behold, we're actually less alone than before. Among the findings and reactions: cell phone use was fairly low, 3 % at one location and 10 % at another, the study found. And users tended to be alone, rather than ruining group dynamics by using cell phones with friends. Public interaction is higher today than in the old films. Today, 24 % of people hanging around outside the metropolitan museum of art are alone, but it was 32 % back in 1979. Sherry turkle, author of alone together, concedes that hampton may be right about public spaces, but says his study ignores the destructive effects of technology in the home. Hampton's most surprising finding: more women are out in public than before. \" i mean, who would've thought that, in america, 30 years ago, women were not in public the same way they are now? \" he says. \" we don't think about that. \" back to the bad news: a kent state university study finds that cell phone use gives students greater anxiety and lower gpas, 23abc news reports. \" i will say, it does distract me and i guess that could affect my gpa, \" says one student.",

Andrew lepp, an associate professor in the college of health and human services, and jacob barkley, an associate professor of exercise science, discovered high-frequency cell phone users tend to have a lower grade point average. The researchers surveyed 500 randomly-chosen university students about how often they use cell phones. On average, the students reported using their phone five hours each day. \" our low cell phone users have an average gpa of about 3.2 on a 4.0 scale, and our high cell phone users had an average gpa of 2.8, \" barkley said. In addition, their six-month study revealed that those spending a higher amount of time on smart phones experienced more anxiety and less happiness in their lives. \" they have a fear of missing out if they're not connected to the network, \" lepp explained. Nick green, a 22-year-old ksu junior, was not surprised by the study. He said he sometimes reaches for his phone when he starts to drift in large lecture halls. \" i will say, it does distract me and i guess that could affect my gpa, \" green said.

Almost 3,000 years ago, the ruler of sheba, which spanned modern-day ethiopia and yemen, arrived in jerusalem with vast quantities of gold to give to king solomon.

He was killed less than a block from a police station, in what police believe was a case of mistaken identity ( neither daquan boyd nor the friend he was with, who was also shot, belong to a gang ). Boyd was one of six people to die in the city between friday night and early yesterday morning. But last night brought with it another shooting, not fatal, of a 7-year-old boy who was struck by two stray bullets while putting away his bike. The tribune reports that a group of people had been arguing with the driver of a car nearby; one of them fired a gun, hitting tyvion jackson on his left side. He is expected to make a full recovery. But in the face of mounting gun deaths comes a change from springfield: gov. Pat quinn yesterday signed into law a bill that he says is \" going to help all of us be safe. \" effectively immediately, illinois becomes the eighth state in the country to require that its gun owners contact police ( within 72 hours ) if their guns have been lost or stolen.

Report co-author david murphey says he wants the public to \" realize there's more to it than the adults themselves. \" children with an incarcerated parent can suffer from a lack of contact with that parent and fear of visiting them in prison, but also from societal stigma, according to the ap. \" if your parent is a soldier overseas, everyone says, ' oh, you're brave, ' \" one expert says. \" when your parent is in prison … you're not viewed in the same heroic way. \" the christian science monitor reports more than 5 million children have experienced having a parent incarcerated — three times more than earlier estimates that only looked at children who had a parent currently locked up. \" most research finds negative outcomes for these children, such as childhood health and behavioral problems and grade retention, \" murphey tells usa today. \" children who grow up with a parent in prison are more likely to suffer from poor mental and physical health in adulthood. \" child trends is fighting for a number of changes, including better communication between children and their incarcerated parents and child-friendly visiting areas and practices in prisons. The ap reports even something as small as allowing children to hug their locked-up parents can have a big impact.",

Dash, a fox news contributor until early last year, has filed paperwork to run for a house seat as a republican in california's 44th district, the sacramento bee reports. The seat, which has been in democratic hands since 2012, is currently held by rep. Nanette diaz barragan. The district, which includes carson, compton, north long beach, and watts, is predominately hispanic and voted for hillary clinton by a massive 83 % -12 % margin in 2016, the hill reports. Dash, 51, has been known as a conservative voice since she endorsed mitt romney in 2012, cnn reports. She later wrote a memoir: \" there goes my social life: from clueless to conservative. \" she first floated the idea of a run for congress early this month, when she tweeted an image of a \" dash to dc \" campaign button. On monday, she tweeted: \" formal statements coming. For those mocking for the district i live in... Open your minds.

        "summary": "It's a pretty extreme case of a disgruntled employee: the times of india reports 37-year-old dhan singh bisht was arrested last week after allegedly stealing $ 96,000 from his employer after being miffed about how a previous heroic gesture was rewarded. That employer, reema polychem private limited in azadpur, tasked bisht with occasionally collecting money from clients; while once transporting roughly $ 110,000, robbers descended on him. Though the hindu reports his neck was injured and he needed 14 stitches, he managed to fend them off — and rather than receive a cash reward as he had expected, his employer gave him only a t-shirt as thanks, per the times. New delhi police allege bisht then hatched a plan to make off with the next money pick-up his employer asked him to make and say he engaged friend yakub hasan to assist him. In late august, bisht was sent to retrieve $ 96,000, and police say he contacted hasan, who picked him up and drove him to a specified location in exchange for about $ 5,500, the majority of which hasan allegedly deposited into his bank account. Bisht reportedly turned off his phone and hid out for several days, then rented a home in burari, north of delhi, and \" lavishly \" decked it out, per the hindu. A sept. 21 tip led police to hasan, and bisht was subsequently arrested as well.",

Their goal, police say, was to keep five elite high schools and three colleges in montgomery county, pa., constantly stocked with drugs — they allegedly called it the \" main line takeover project, \" cbs philly reports. One of the alleged ringleaders, 18-year-old timothy brooks, \" said this was important to him because he remembered not always being able to buy marijuana when he was in high school, \" according to investigators. Brooks graduated from the haverford school, a $ 35,000-per-year, all-boys prep school, in 2013; his alleged co-ringleader, 25-year-old neil scott, was a 2008 grad of the school. Police say scott had drugs shipped from california to his haverford apartment; he sometimes also used his parents ' paoli house or brooks ' parents ' house in wealthy villanova to deal the drugs. The nine dealers, ages 17 to 29, who allegedly worked beneath brooks and scott were told to move at least one pound of marijuana per week, police say, and the da says the pair \" were using very traditional business practices, \" including discount incentives and lines of credit, to push their product, according to the philadelphia inquirer. They also allegedly moved cocaine, hash oil, and ecstasy. Police seized a stash of those drugs, plus $ 11,000 in cash, two ar-15 rifles, one handgun, and a lot of ammo. \" this is a huge story because of the prestige of the schools involved, \" one of brooks ' friends tells the washington post. \" i knew he was into some sketchy stuff, but i had no idea he was a drug kingpin. \"",

        "summary": "Has a notorious international murder mystery been solved? maybe not, but there is a compelling new theory in the case of swedish prime minister olof palme, reports the new york times. On feb. 28, 1986, palme went to a movie in stockholm with his wife and was shot point-blank from behind as they left. He died at the scene. A minor criminal, christer pettersson, was convicted of the crime shortly after, but won release on appeal, and died in 2004. Over the years, the police questioned an estimated 10,000 people in connection with the crime, and according to the bbc, 134 people have claimed to be the killer. An assortment of shadowy factions — including the cia, arms dealers, apartheid loyalists – were suspected of the crime at various times. Enter freelance journalist thomas pettersson, who has been investigating the murder for 12 years. He has a new theory, as reported in filter magazine ( link is in swedish ). Pettersson lays out considerable circumstantial evidence that stig engstrom, who happened upon the scene within minutes of the crime and testified as a witness in pettersson's trial, murdered palme. Engstrom appears to have had opportunity and motive, pettersson says. He also had weapons training and access to a firearm similar to the one used in the crime, lied to investigators, fit the police profile of the killer, and seemed to bask in the attention his proximity to the case brought. Engstrom can't defend himself — he committed suicide in 2000. But his former wife ( they divorced in 1999 ), believes he's innocent. \" he was not that kind of person, that's for sure, \" she told expressen, per the bbc. \"he was too much of a coward. He wouldn't harm a fly. \" pettersson has delivered his findings to the police.",

Binns, 42, was able to stop 32-year-old sunita hazra, who was returning from the summit, but he soon realized she was out of oxygen. That's when the british ex-soldier — awarded a medal for bravery for his work finding ieds in afghanistan, which left him blinded in one eye — made his decision: forgo the summit and help the woman. Handing over his spare oxygen bottle, binns clipped hazra to him and began descending with his sherpa guide. They \" came across another man from her team who was also in distress, \" and binns \" clipped the man onto himself as well, \" an acquaintance tells the hindustan times. But when a storm hit, binns had to abandon the man, who \" kept collapsing. \" binns eventually made it to his camp, where he gave hazra his sleeping bag and used a flask of ginger tea to try to warm her frostbitten right hand before her sherpa arrived to help her descend. At one point, binns says he heard the male climber calling in the distance, \" but i was too exhausted to go back out. I literally collapsed and fell asleep. \" he was later told the man had been rescued, but binns came across his body while descending the next day. \" i am immensely proud that i helped sunita, \" but \" i truly regret not being able to do anything more for him, \" binns says of the man. \" i owe my life to him, \" says hazra of binns, noting he has allowed her to \" return home to see my child. What else can i say? \" ( this climber's wife died in his arms on everest. )",

The sensational claim prompted the miami herald to look back on the obituary it ran for rebozo when he died in 1998. It noted that the two men were friends for more than 40 years and that rebozo would frequently visit the white house. \" they were inseparable — you just can't imagine how close two men could be, \" recalled one gop campaigner. \" it was as if bebe had the key to unlock richard nixon's soul. \" among the book's other allegations: that nixon beat his wife, and that rebozo was given a bedroom at the white house during nixon's presidency.

        "summary": "Bill clinton did an interview with nbc news to plug the new novel he's written with james patterson, but the former president spent a good deal of time instead talking about his old behavior in light of the metoo movement. In the sometimes testy back-and-forth with craig melvin, clinton defended his decision not to resign amid the monica lewinsky scandal and acknowledged that he has not personally apologized to her. Clinton said he has publicly apologized to lewinsky ( nbc played a 1998 clip of him doing so ), but not privately. \" i've never talked to her, \" he said when pressed on the point by melvin. Clinton also said he was correct not to resign. \" i think i did the right thing. I defended the constitution. \" later, clinton asked melvin if he thought john f. Kennedy should have resigned and accused the reporter of presenting a biased picture of him. The ap describes clinton as \" both vague and combative \" during the interview. This might be an example of vague: asked how he \" would have approached the accusations differently \" today if he were president, clinton responded, \" well, i don't think it would be an issue because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts. If the facts were the same today, i wouldn't. \" and he seemed to bristle at comparisons to president trump. \" a lot of the facts have been conveniently omitted to make the story work, i think partly because they're frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the oval office and his voters don't seem to care. \" he added that he doesn't think trump has gotten a \" pass \" on the allegations against him, but trump \" hasn't gotten anything like the coverage that you would expect. \"",

The so-called \"manx \" comet, named after a breed of cats without tails, was made of rocky materials that are normally found near earth.

However, it is expected that volatiles in ice-rich bodies should be able to sustain cometary activity for up to 1000 perihelion passages ( 3 ). Furthermore, models for the number of oort cloud comets that enter the inner solar system and subsequently fade predict a large number of dormant isotropic long-period comets that are not seen ( 7 ).

The odd-looking c/2014 s3 was spotted 18 months ago through the pan-starrs telescope. Most comets are bright with brilliant tails of evaporating ice, and started life in the oort cloud on the solar system's edges. But c/2014 s3 looks as dark and rocky as an asteroid, and has a stubby tail made mostly of dust. \"i had never heard of such a thing. We wondered,",
            "Cape canaveral, fla. ( reuters ) - astronomers have found a first-of-its-kind tailless comet whose composition may offer clues into long-standing questions about the solar system's formation and evolution, according to research published on friday in the journal science advances. The so-called \"manx \" comet, named after a breed of cats without tails, was made of rocky materials that are normally found near earth. Most comets are made of ice and other frozen compounds and were formed in solar system's frigid far reaches. Researchers believe the newly found comet was formed in the same region as earth, then booted to the solar system's backyard like a gravitational slingshot as planets jostled",
            "A new kind of comet that is nearly tailless has been discovered — and the surprises don't stop there. The new comet recently returned from the edge of the solar system but may have originated much closer to the sun, scientists say. In fact, it may even reveal clues about the building blocks of earth. Given the nearly tailless appearance of this new comet, the scientists named it a manx object, after manx cats, which are mostly tailless. \" i always tell my students that science is 99-percent hard work, sometimes tedious, because the details really matter, \" said study lead author karen meech, an astronomer at the university of"

        "summary": "Oysters may have a new no. 1 menace in the sea: plastic. A troubling new study finds that oysters feeding on microplastics quickly develop serious reproduction problems, scientists report at phys.org. In their study, researchers grew pacific oysters in a lab and exposed them to the type of microplastic particles they would encounter in the ocean. Because these particles were the same size as the phytoplankton the oysters typically consume, the creatures gobbled them right up. After two months, the oysters were producing 41 % fewer offspring, and those offspring grew more slowly than normal. Even the male oysters'sperm moved more slowly, reports science. Why this happens is unclear: it may be because the plastic is causing hormonal problems or, more simply, is gumming up digestive systems and making it more difficult for the oysters to consume food and thus get energy. The results should be seen as \" an early warning system \" about the rising amount of microplastics in the ocean, say the french and belgian researchers in their study, published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. What's more, the dangers can be applied to other \" marine bivalves \" that feed in the same way as oysters, reports discovery. These microplastics are used in cosmetics and other industrial practices and commonly enter the ocean when products get flushed, notes smithsonian, which frames the problem this way: oysters will appear on many a valentine's day plate because of their supposed aphrodisiac powers, but the creatures are imperiled by the products used by couples primping for that same meal. ( the study follows a different one predicting that the world's oceans will have more plastic than fish by 2050. )",

        "summary": "Europeans have dined on dogs, foxes, badgers, and wild cats, a new study says — although admittedly it's been a while. Researchers base this on ancient small-carnivore remains discovered in a spanish cave, the telegraph reports. Dating back 3,100 to 7,200 years, the remains show signs of human bite marks, cut marks, breaks, and evidence of culinary processing ( like being defleshed and boiled ). Early humans apparently used the cave at atapuerca to shelter sheep flocks, but had to eat too, and may have downed dogs and cats during famines: \" it's one of the possibilities, \" says researcher patricia martin. \" however, in some asian cultures dog meat is considered a rich source of protein or as a delicatessen meat. \" she says early humans may have also killed these animals to \" obtain the skin. \" either way, she adds, cave dwellers may have grabbed these wild carnivores by chance because catching them was so hard. The 24 fossils offer the first tooth-mark evidence of humans consuming such animals, the study says, but the catalan institute of human paleoecology and social evolution mentions earlier finds pointing to consumption of similar animals on mediterranean islands like cyprus during neolithic times. An odd side-note: \" dog consumption is sporadic but occurs repeatedly in time, \" says martin, \" whereas the consumption of small wild carnivores is more limited in time. \" ( for another ancient find, read about a shipwreck that yielded \" atlantis \" metal. )",

Engineers discovered in may that another of the telescope's gyroscopic wheels had gone on the fritz, meaning it could no longer remain steady enough to collect images of stars in its hunt for other planets. Nasa has now given up trying to fix the problem, but it hopes that the $ 600 million telescope can be repurposed through old-fashioned ingenuity, reports the los angeles times. The agency is asking scientists to submit suggestions over the next month. \" it's very common, \" says a penn state astronomer. \" oftentimes you design a spacecraft with everything you want to do but inevitably, at some point, something won't work. And then you have to figure out, what do we do? \" ideas include using the telescope in a different way to study asteroids and comets. What's more, it will take scientists another three or four years to analyze data already collected by kepler, which has found 135 confirmed planets and 3,500 possible candidates since it launched in 2009. \" we expect the most exciting discoveries will come in the next years, \" says a kepler scientist.",

The city is doing nothing wrong by limiting its own involvement in immigration enforcement, while trump is overreaching by trying to make cities do the work of the federal government, mayor ed murray and city attorney pete holmes said wednesday. The goal of the lawsuit, filed in u.s. District court in seattle, is to have the executive order declared unconstitutional, murray said at a news conference, accusing the trump administration of waging \"a war on cities. \" \"our lawsuit is staying true to our values, \" the mayor said. \"we value civil rights, we value the courts and we value the constitution. \" seattle is suing the federal government, mayor ed murray announced today. He said the executive order by president trump violates the constitution by trying to make local governments enforce federal law.

Purpose. Interior enforcement of our nation's immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the united states. Many aliens who illegally enter the united states and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety. This is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the united states. Sanctuary jurisdictions across the united states willfully violate federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the united states. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the american people and to the very fabric of our republic.

For the next few weeks, the spacecraft will continue to take photos of pluto to capture different angles. The majority of the time, however, the spacecraft will be sending back data and images to earth, a process that will take about 16 months to complete.

( photo: none, johns hopkins university applied ) flying by pluto was the goal, but the new horizons spacecraft isn't stopping anytime soon — or at least that's what the team of scientists and engineers hopes. After a nearly 10 year journey, the new horizons spacecraft snapped unprecedented photos of the dwarf planet and collected data to send back to earth. For the next few weeks, the spacecraft will continue to take photos of pluto to capture different angles. The majority of the time, however, the spacecraft will be sending back data and images to earth, a process that will take about 16 months to complete. With scientists saying all signs point to the spacecraft being in full health, the team has its sights set on further discoveries. Alan stern, the principal investigator of new horizons, said the spacecraft has enough power to keep going until the mid-2030s. By that point, it will be roughly 9.3 billion miles from the sun, he said. \" we have a chance to go further and explore the deep reaches of the heliosphere,",

But completing the solar system's planetary family portrait is just a small part of the spacecraft's journey — it's already explored jupiter and is now destined to probe a mysterious zone of icy objects called the kuiper belt. In fact, mission leader and planetary scientist alan stern says new horizons may have decades ' worth of exploration left in it, thanks to its long-lived nuclear power source. Pre-pluto homework before its personal rendezvous with pluto, new horizons swung by jupiter for a gravitational speed boost. This shaved almost 4 years off its travel time, to a total of 9 1/2 years. New horizons did a little science while it was in the jovian neighborhood, too. For example, its cameras caught the tvashtar volcano exploding on jupiter's third-largest moon, io. It also made about 700 other observations, giving new horizons the opportunity to test its suite of seven scientific instruments. Now, about 8 years later, new horizons is completing what's arguably the most popular leg of its trip — zooming past pluto and its moons, of which there are at least five.

A man named hjalti sigurjon hauksson was sentenced to five years in prison in 2004 for repeatedly raping his stepdaughter starting when she was 5 and continuing for 12 years, the guardian reports. An icelandic law allows convicted criminals to \" restore their honor \" and regain some rights. One requirement of the law is a supportive letter from a close friend. Benedikt sveinsson, father of benediktsson, was that close friend for hauksson. Benediktsson allegedly learned of his father's letter in july — the prime minister says he was \" in shock \" — but the government didn't disclose it until this week when forced by a parliamentary committee. The bright future party called the whole situation a \" serious breach of trust \" and pulled out of a coalition with benediktsson's independence party and the reform party. Benediktsson had been relying on that center-right coalition to hold a one-seat majority in the government. \" we have lost the majority, and i don't see anything that indicates we can regain that.

Mrsa is resistant to most types of antibiotics, and the league, the team, and the nflpa are trying to figure out why bucs players are falling victim. \"this underscores the need for a leaguewide, comprehensive and standardized infectious disease protocol, \" says demaurice smith, executive director of the union. Mrsa infections have cropped up before in the nfl over the last decade, notes the new york times, in part because of the ideal conditions for it: it's a physical game that causes cuts and bruises, which the players then bring into the locker room.

        "summary": "Arachnophobes, rejoice! a new study suggests a cure to your fear of spiders is just two minutes away. The only problem is that it involves being near a tarantula. Reporting in biological psychiatry, university of amsterdam scientists say they built an experiment out of the idea of reconsolidation — that memories can be strengthened or weakened when activated, reports treehugger. Previous research showed a fearful memory could be forgotten if a drug was administered when that memory was activated, per a release. So researchers exposed 45 arachnophobes to a tarantula for two minutes, then gave each a dose of beta blocker propranolol, used to treat high blood pressure and heart conditions, or a placebo. Those given propranolol saw drastically reduced \" avoidance behavior \" and increased \" approach behavior \" over the next year. In other words, they were less likely to dodge spiders and more likely to go near one. \" here we show for the first time that an amnesic drug given in conjunction with memory reactivation transformed avoidance behavior to approach behavior in people with a real-life spider fear, \" says study author merel kindt. Though more research is needed, the scientist suggests the same technique could be used on patients suffering from anxiety disorders and ptsd. These individuals \" receive multiple sessions of cognitive behavioral treatment or daily drug intake with a gradual ( and often temporary ) decline of symptoms, \" kindt says. \" the proposed revolutionary intervention involves one single, brief intervention that leads to a sudden, substantial and lasting loss of fear. \" not interested in hanging around a tarantula? atlas obscura reports the london zoo is helping people overcome their fear of spiders with group hypnosis.

        "summary": "A new lawsuit claims a teen inmate at rikers island died in solitary confinement while begging for medical attention. The family of andy henriquez says he complained of chest pain for seven months before he was found dead of a ruptured aorta last april at 19. \" he used to say ' i don't feel right, my chest hurts, i feel like i can't breathe, ' \" another inmate said in a deposition; a second inmate said that henriquez \" was screaming all day and all night \" before his death. Henriquez's mom, sandra de la cruz, is now suing corizon, the company that provides health care to the inmates, telling dnainfo new york, \" they should have taken him to the hospital. \" instead, henriquez was given hand cream — prescribed to an incorrect name — plus an anti-inflammatory drug and a muscle relaxant, court documents show. Henriquez, who had been in the jail for three years awaiting trial for murder and gang assault, was diagnosed with joint pain near his heart at least eight times over seven months. Yet the rikers clinic never ordered a cardiac exam or follow-up testing that might have uncovered henriquez's torn artery — \" a gross departure from proper medical standards, \" an expert explains in documents from the suit. The family's lawyer adds, per the new york daily news, that rikers ' conditions \" are deplorable. \" meanwhile, corrections officers admit checks that were supposed to be scheduled every 15 minutes were not completed correctly on the day of henriquez's death. They say they heard no cries for help, though one of his fellow inmates heard differently. \" they said, ' look, we took you yesterday. The doctor said you're fine, ' \" he testified. That night, henriquez died. ( another rikers inmate died following a week alone in his cell. )",

Lazo tells the efes news agency in chile that this case is \" extraordinarily rare, \" reports the independent. A study published in 2000 in the sao paulo medical journal defined just how rare: the phenomenon happens in just 1.5 % to 1.8 % of the abdominal pregnancies that occur — and the incidence of those are 1 in 11,000. \" there have been less than 300 cases in 400 years of world medical literature, \" per the study. It looked at those recorded cases and found that two-thirds of the diagnoses happened in women over 40, with the \" period of fetus retention \" ranging from four to 60 years. As with other cases, the chilean woman was unaware of the presence of the fetus.

The white house will dole out $ 4.7 billion in direct aid to help make up for their reduced profits, reports bloomberg. Most of that, $ 3.6 billion, is designated for soybean farmers, who have been especially hard hit by penalties imposed by china. As the wall street journal notes, other farming groups aren't thrilled with their totals. The national corn growers association, for instance, says the $ 96 million earmarked for corn growers won't come close to making up for their financial losses this year, which the group estimates to be around $ 6 billion. Producers of pork, cotton, sorghum, dairy, and wheat also are in line for money. Farmers can start applying sept. 4, roughly the start of harvest season. \" today's aid announcement gives us some breathing room, but it will keep many of us going only a few months more, \" says zippy duvall, president of the american farm bureau federation. \" the real solution to this trade war is to take a tough stance at the negotiating table and quickly find a resolution with our trading partners. \" in addition to the $ 4.7 billion, the usda will spend $ 1.2 billion to buy commodities such as pork, apples, and nuts to help keep prices stable, reports usa today. If the trade disputes aren't resolved by december, the usda says a second round of direct payments will be considered.

See that site or the star-telegram to view box's graphic, nearly three-minute video of the expletive-filled showdown between howard and his neighbors, which box says started after she and howard threw an old mattress into a dumpster in the alley behind their abilene home. Neighbors john miller, 67, and his son michael miller, 31, apparently didn't like that, and the mattress suddenly reappeared back in the howards ' yard. Howard dragged it back to the dumpster, and that's when both millers emerged into the alley, shirtless, and box started taping the dispute. As the three men exchange curses and death threats, the elder miller grasps a handgun, while michael miller holds onto a shotgun; howard is unarmed, until he's handed a baseball bat by his brother, box says. The argument escalates, box steps between her husband and john miller, and then howard says: \" c ' mon, shoot me! \" two shots are heard, and then michael miller is seen on the video firing more shots. Box screams as she rushes over to howard, now on the ground ( blurred out in the video ), \" for a second i thought he was going to be ok, but he didn't make it, \" she tells the star-telegram. The millers have been charged with murder but are currently free after posting $ 25,000 bail. \" this is something that i consider a private matter between me and the state of texas, \" john miller tells the washington post.

At the international astronautical congress in australia on friday, musk opened up about spacex's progress on its bfr ( big f****ing rocket ) that he hopes will carry humans to mars by 2024. \" if you build a ship that's capable of going to mars, what if you take that same ship and go from one place to another on earth? \" he asked, per space.com. Think new york city to shanghai in about 40 minutes, and la to toronto in 24 minutes. Coverage on this and other musk-related news, including some involving his successful mother: maybe like this: here's a video animation showing a bfr carrying travelers from new york city to shanghai in 39 minutes at speeds of 18,000mph. Buckle up: musk did not comment on the turbulence to be expected when exiting and entering the atmosphere on a bfr, which will be roughly 30 feet wide by 350 feet long, per the bbc. Musk expects work on the first bfr to begin next year. The goal is to have two cargo ships travel to mars by 2022, with two cargo ships and two crewed ships following in 2024. How realistic? well, don't hold your breath about all this. ( musk wants a base on the moon, too. ) \" even the most ardent fans of musk and his ambitions... Cannot really believe the bfr will land humans on mars seven years from now, \" writes eric berger at ars technica. \" we don't. \" but musk's 40-minute presentation had enough \" tidbits of plausibility \" to make discounting his vision entirely seem \" foolhardy. \" elon's mom: musk's mother is 69-year-old maye musk, who is a dietitian and nutritionist with two master's degree. She also happens to have 50 years of modeling experience, and she just became a new covergirl model, only the latest achievement in an impressive run of late. The new york times has a q&a with her. No family privileges: asked if she's scored a new tesla 3 yet, she tells the times, \" i ' m at around 300,000. Even though i have good connections, i can't jump the line. \" ( her son, of course, also is ceo of tesla. ) business insider quotes a cousin of elon musk's who confirms that being related to the ceo brings no special favors when it comes to teslas. $ 50 million challenge: as of friday, the clock is ticking",

On jan. 6, 1999, curtis, 12, and his 13-year-old sister catherine shot and killed their father's girlfriend sonya nicole speights as she worked on a jigsaw puzzle; the brevard, fla., siblings fled into the woods and were located the next day. Jealousy was initially floated as the motive ( their father intended to wed speights ). A grand jury determined they should be charged as adults; rather than risk life in prison, they pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were handed 18-year sentences, of which they had to serve a mandatory 85 %. As florida today explained it in a january article, that meant no testimony and no trial — and no revelation of what the paper describes as \" easily verifiable \" sex abuse allegations. Catherine said in a 1999 interview they were both abused — \" to the point where i would throw up \" — by a male relative who was living with them. The children allegedly intended to kill him and their father as well. That part of the plan never came to pass. Fast-forward to today: now 29, curtis is an ordained minister who, as the miami new times puts it, has \" never driven a car or sent a text message. \" and a former inmate tells florida today curtis is exiting into a \" world of trouble \" — a reference to the second part of the siblings'sentences: probation for life ( which means, among other things, no drinking to excess ). \" they ' ll never make it unless they're pure to the core. \" as for catherine, a correspondence with a pen-pal turned into marriage in 2013.

The agency recently introduced additional security measures including pat-downs and full-body scans that create an image of the traveler's naked body.orlando sanford international has received \" some complaints \" about tsa personnel and decided to take advantage of tsa rules that allow an airport to use private contractors, crews said. \" this isn't us saying, ' we hate the tsa, we want to go private, ' \" crews told aol news. \" we are taking advantage of a tsa program. \" seventeen other airports, including jackson hole, wyo,.

The push is being led by a powerful florida congressman who's a longtime critic of the transportation security administration and counts among his campaign contributors some of the companies who might take the tsa's place. Furor over airline passenger checks has grown as more airports have installed scanners that produce digital images of the body's contours, and the anger intensified when tsa added a more intrusive style of pat-down recently for those who opt out of the full-body scans.

Though four suspects were arrested monday, they had initially been cleared by a travel agency that employs them, reports the press trust of india, per abc australia. When questioned, the men reportedly told investigators they were being falsely accused, noting the woman had voluntarily traveled with them to the taj mahal a day after the alleged assault. However, a police rep says the victim \" helped us collect clinching evidence \" upon her return to india. The woman also told police that the men threatened to release a video of the assault and claimed to have raped other female tourists, reports the express.

The 22-year-old, who had gone to saudi arabia to marry his fiancee, was one of three volunteer security officers killed in an attack on a shiite mosque on friday, and officials say he saved hundreds of lives by keeping the suicide bomber out of the building, ksn reports. The attack — the second deadly saudi mosque blast in a week — involved a suicide bomber dressed in women's clothes who blew himself up when he was challenged by guards, the new york times reports. Isis has claimed responsibility for both attacks. Alarbash, an electrical engineering major, had planned to return to his studies in kansas this fall, ksn reports. The other two volunteer guards killed in the attack were his brother and their cousin, according to his father, who says the trio died as heroes. In wichita, students and staff members describe alarbash as an \" amazing \" guy who always went out of his way to help others and was very excited about his upcoming wedding. \" i think the way in which he passed away shows a lot about the person, \" the director of the university's engineering career center tells cnn. \" he was definitely a pleasure to work with. \" ( to keep isis out, the saudis have been building a 600-mile \" great wall. \" )",

Politico explains: huntsman \" didn't want to stand in the way of the candidate most likely to beat barack obama and turn the economy around, \" says one campaign official. \" that's mitt romney. \" and huntsman's handful of south carolina voters will likely switch to romney — even a small number of extra votes could help romney clinch the win — which is why huntsman, who wants to be seen as a team player since romney will likely be the nominee, will exit now rather than after the south carolina primary. Huntsman also saw a better chance to control the coverage of his exit by getting out now. If he waited until after the primary, his withdrawal could be overshadowed by rick perry's anticipated departure. By leaving now, huntsman departs on the high note of his new hampshire third-place finish, which came after a surge in the polls. Even so, that finish was \" too little too late, \" says one official, and the campaign didn't have any money for tv, radio, or direct-mail ads this coming week. There was no fundraising bump after the new hampshire primary, huntsman himself was reluctant to loan the campaign more money, and even his father was wary of providing any additional funding to a pro-huntsman super pac. Nate silver concurs with politico's assessment that huntsman's exit will help romney. In the new york times, he compiles the results of seven recent public policy polling surveys and finds that 32 % of huntsman supporters named romney as their second choice. Next up was ron paul, whom 15 % picked as a second choice. ( but 24 % of huntsman backers were undecided. ) in a bit of irony, huntsman's exit came on the very day south carolina's biggest newspaper, the state, endorsed him.",

Romney is far more appealing than any of the other choices, former utah gov. Jon huntsman is more principled, has a far more impressive resume and offers a significantly more important message.

Unesco has postponed a decision to put the 133,000-square-mile coral reef system on its \" world heritage in danger \" list, giving the australian and queensland governments a year to curb mining and development in the region, the wall street journal reports. The reef is the only living organism that can be seen from space, and is home to 400 varieties of coral and 1,500 types of fish. \" the great barrier reef is an iconic environmental asset and the australian government is absolutely committed to the protection of the reef and our oceans, \" says australia's environment minister, adding the government has now committed $ 200 million to rescuing the reef. However, unesco says it needs to do more, including curbing planned port expansions and reducing agricultural run-off, reports the guardian. The conservative state government admits squabbles with the more liberal federal government have delayed the creation rescue plan, but one was finally approved monday, which the state environment minister says already addresses unesco's concerns, the australian reports.",
