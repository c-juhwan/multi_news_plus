The death rate in canada was 44 % lower than among americans on medicare and medicaid, and 77 % lower than americans with no insurance, the new york times reports. But among americans with private health insurance, there was no difference in death rates. Canada has universal health care coverage. \" it seems people with no insurance have the worst outcomes compared to canadians, lead researcher dr. Anne l. Stephenson tells the times. \" that was the largest difference seen, \" cystic fibrosis is a progressive genetic disorder that causes lung infections and eventual respiratory failure. Median life span of patients in canada is 50.9 years, versus 40.6 in the us, per the cbc. Writing in the annals of internal medicine, researchers examined the medical records of nearly 6,000 canadians and 45,500 americans suffering from cf between 1990 and 2013. They found the overall death rate in canada was 34 % lower than in the us. Lung transplants can extend life, and canadians were more likely to receive new lungs at a rate of 10.3 % compared with 6.5 % in the us. Diet also was credited with a spike in longevity, with canada recommending a high-fat diet rich in cheese, fish, and nuts for cystic fibrosis sufferers since the 1970s, a decade ahead of the us. The findings show the need to stengthen medicare and medicaid programs \" that provide thousands of people with cf with access to care and treatments, \" co-author dr. Bruce marshall tells cnn.

However, players interviewed by the fbi tell the times that agents aren't just interested in whether such sites might be trafficking in what amounts to inside information: they're also investigating whether draftkings accepted or even encouraged bets from states and countries where the contests are banned. On a public forum, a draftkings exec may have told players how to make bets from places where the games aren't allowed. A man who's filed a class-action lawsuit — one of three alleging draftkings or fanduel committed fraud — says he submitted money even though the operation of daily fantasy sports sites is banned in his home state of louisiana. \" we have no knowledge of the specifics of any federal investigation but strongly disagree with any notion that our company has engaged in any illegal activities, \" draftkings says. An exec adds the company will comply with any new regulations should they come, per the boston globe. New york's attorney general has given draftkings and fanduel until thursday to submit internal data, including player records, \" algorithms that determine the fantasy pricing for athletes, and details on their policies to prevent fraud, \" reports the wall street journal.

Of these — typically towels associated with children, larger families, multiple uses, higher humidity, and diets containing meat — 37 % contained e.

According to propublica, new guidelines were issued in a june 8 internal memo to replace obama-era mandates. Under obama, certain complaints — such as colleges mishandling sexual assaults or racial disparities in discipline at schools — would automatically trigger an expanded investigation to look for patterns and broader problems. These larger investigations led to new policies centered on civil rights at public schools and universities. But a department of education spokesperson says under the obama mandates, the time it took to close cases \" skyrocketed \" and the backlog of cases \" exploded. \" she says the goal now is to speed up the process to give \" every complaint the individualized and thorough consideration it deserves. \" under the new guidelines, local officers will have the freedom to decide whether or not to pursue complaints — a second memo specifically highlights complaints regarding transgender students — and certain types of complaints will no longer trigger a broader investigation, the los angeles times reports.

Media matters has turned up a new claim that o'reilly lied about what he saw while covering civil war in el salvador in the 1980s. On dec. 2, 1980, early in the war between the government and the farabundo martí national liberation front, members of the national guard raped and killed three american nuns and a layworker. O'reilly said at least twice that he saw it happen. \" i've seen guys gun down nuns in el salvador, \" he said on his talk-radio program in 2005. On the o'reilly factor in 2012, he said he told his mom, \" i was in el salvador and i saw nuns get shot in the back of the head. \" o'reilly has also said he only arrived in the country in 1981. In his book, the no spin zone, o'reilly said he arrived in el salvador \" a few weeks \" after he became a cbs news correspondent in 1981. On a 2002 episode of the o'reilly factor, he again said, \" i went to el salvador in 1981. \" in a 2009 interview on hamptons tv, o'reilly outright said he arrived \" right after \" the killings. Though a single nun, among others, was killed by government troops on jan. 17, 1981, a religion professor says that after that, \" no priests or nuns were killed in el salvador for more than eight years. \" in a statement to mediaite, o'reilly says reporters were shown \" horrendous images of violence \" and \" that's what i am referring to when i say ' i saw nuns get shot in the back of the head. ' \" a fox news rep calls the accusations \" nothing more than an orchestrated campaign by far left advocates. \"",

In what it hopes will eventually nab it a world first, china on monday launched its queqiao ( aka \" magpie bridge \" ) satellite, per state media, putting it one step closer to being the first country to land on the so-called dark side of the moon, the guardian reports. So far, no probe has ever successfully made it to the part of the moon we never get to see, mainly because of communications issues: signals from a probe on the dark side wouldn't make it all the way back to earth due to interference from moon rock. By entering the moon's orbit about 282,000 miles from earth, however, queqiao will serve as a middleman between the chang ' e 4 lander-rover china plans to send to the dark side later this year and stations back on earth, space.com notes. Set to a rousing musical score, a video of queqiao's assembly to its rocket, followed by its launch, was disseminated by state media on monday. Two smaller satellites also went along for the ride, with a mission to collect radio astronomy data. This endeavor is a smaller part of china's larger initiative to make inroads in space exploration on the level of the us or russia, who've long dominated the field. When chang ' e 4 heads to the moon at the end of 2018, it will be carrying seeds for potatoes and a cabbage-like plant for a \" lunar mini biosphere \" test, per the guardian, which adds china has big plans to send humans to the moon within the next 15 years or so.

        "summary": "With many americans wondering where all the money is, they might want to check the pockets of the new trump cabinet. Quartz reports the 17 people donald trump has selected for his cabinet or cabinet-level posts have a combined wealth of more than $ 9.5 billion. That's more money than the bottom one-third of american households — all 43 million of them — have total. In fact, it would take 120,000 median american households — with a worth of $ 83,200 — to equal the wealth of just the four richest members of trump's cabinet. The guardian calls it \" the most brazen embrace of big money since the 1980s. \" and it's not just happenstance. \"i want people that made a fortune! because now they're negotiating for you, ok? \" salon quotes trump as saying during a rally last week. He's certainly getting them. Quartz reports the level of wealth in his cabinet is already \" unprecedented \" with some spots still left to fill. Critics warn this is a prelude to trump enacting policies that benefit the richest of the rich to the detriment of middle- and lower-class americans. \"this is a class that dines on lobster steak and caviar every night, \" a democracy for america spokesperson tells the guardian. \" they're not figuring out how to put food on the table. They're figuring out how to make a few more millions before they go home at night. \"",

After two sips from a glass of wine engelien brought her, pina tells kiro 7 she blacked out and awoke partially naked in bed in engelien's hotel room, where engelien was on the phone. Later deemed unfit to fly, engelien told a confused pina on a flight back to seattle that she'd gotten drunk and come on to him, according to pina, who didn't mention an alleged rape when questioned by airline officials. But pina says she did report it to a union rep and hr official days later after finding a \" handprint bruise \" on her thigh. She says she later learned a flight attendant had seen engelien in a hotel hallway with glasses of wine and a woman seemingly in danger. Pina says a lawyer hired to investigate a possible breach of airline policy banning pilots from consuming alcohol before a scheduled flight also told her a security video showed an \" incapacitated \" pina trying to fight off engelien's attempts to get her in his hotel room. Her lawsuit places liability on alaska airlines and doesn't go after engelien. Pina says she's open to a separate criminal case against him, but she says she initially didn't report him to police because \" i thought telling my company and my supervisor is all i needed to do. \" alaska airlines describes the matter as \" an open and active investigation. \"",

That's because mars would have had plenty of the minerals that are best at forging rna, which is one of the key components of life and is believed to have predated dna. On earth, those minerals would have dissolved into the ocean ( water is \" corrosive \" to rna, adds space.com ). But life could have formed on mars, then headed here on meteorites, suggests us scientist steven benner; he's not the first to propose such a theory, the bbc notes. The investigation centers on how atoms were arranged to form rna, dna, and proteins. Benner says minerals containing the elements boron and an oxidized form of molybdenum were central to the process — but at the time, earth was probably incapable of supporting enough of such minerals. He tells space.com that analysis of a martian meteorite revealed the presence of boron on mars, and \" we now believe that the oxidized form of molybdenum was there, too. \" as such, \" the evidence seems to be building that we are actually all martians; that life started on mars and came to earth on a rock, \" says benner. \" it's lucky that we ended up here, nevertheless — as certainly earth has been the better of the two planets for sustaining life. \" click for more on how nobody really wants to head back there.",

        "summary": "Florida anglers who allegedly filmed themselves brutally dragging a shark behind their boat at high speeds are now facing felony charges. Robert benac, 28, michael wenzel, 21, and spencer heintz, 23, have been charged with aggravated animal cruelty in florida for the video that surfaced five months ago, reports the bradenton herald. The video went viral after it was emailed to renowned shark fisherman mark quartiano, who posted it to instagram while condemning the men's actions, reports the miami herald. The men in the video can be heard laughing as the shark is violently whipped around. One also laughs as it sounds like he points out the shark is nearly dead. The florida fish and wildlife conservation commission then launched an investigation that culminated in this week's arrests. \" as we've said since this video and other images came to light, these actions have no place in florida, where we treasure and conserve our natural resources for everyone, \" says fwc chairman bo rivard in a release. Gov. Rick scott denounced the shark's treatment as \" inhumane \" and said he was sickened by the video. Fwc investigators say they were able to identify the men thanks in part to people who knew them and came forward. Benac and wenzel face additional misdemeanor charges of using an illegal method to take a shark. In poring over the men's social media postings, investigators also uncovered clips of anglers firing guns at sharks.",

        "summary": "\" men have a better sense of direction than women. \" so goes the headline on a press release outlining a new study from the norwegian university of science and technology. The fact that men excel at certain spatial tasks, the release says, is well established. The goal of the study was to determine whether testosterone is the reason. Phase one involved 18 men and 18 women using a joystick and goggles to perform 45 navigation tasks, each with a 30-second time limit, on a 3d maze. They were hooked up to an fmri machine that recorded their brain activity. The results: the men relied more on cardinal directions ( north, south, east, west ) took more shortcuts, and completed 50 % more tasks than the women. And, researchers found, men and women use different parts of their brains — the hippocampus and frontal areas, respectively — for \" wayfinding \" tasks. \" in ancient times, men were hunters and women were gatherers. Therefore, our brains probably evolved differently, \" researcher carl pintzka theorizes. \" in simple terms, women are faster at finding things in the house, and men are faster at finding the house. \" in phase two, a new group of women were given a drop of testosterone and then asked to perform the navigation tasks. Researchers hoped they would complete more tasks. That didn't happen, pintzka says. However, their knowledge of the maze's layout improved and they used the hippocampus more … like the men. The ultimate goal of the research, pintzka says, is to gain more understanding about alzheimer's disease, which, per cnbc, affects many more women than men. Men's prowess when it comes to navigation — and putting together furniture — isn't necessarily cause for gloating. After all, women still live longer, are more likely to graduate college, and are better investors. ( but a bit of bad news, women also are outpacing men when it comes to obesity. )",

        "summary": "The government in kiev appears to have today blocked all international flights into, and many flights out of, the ukraine's restive east in the wake of yesterday's violence and in anticipation of violence ahead of friday's holiday commemorating world war ii. At least 20 flights out of kharkiv, the east's largest city, and donetsk, the regional capital, have been canceled, the new york times reports. Authorities also yesterday said they'd set up vehicle checkpoints around kiev to guard against attacks. Kiev now estimates that 30 pro-russian militants were killed in yesterday's fighting outside slovyansk, along with four ukrainian soldiers. The separatists also shot down a military helicopter there — the fourth they've notched in recent days — although both its pilots survived, the washington post and guardian report. The government has also sent special forces to odessa. As the situation intensifies, western leaders are making some dire assessments: germany's foreign minister warned that ukraine is on the brink of outright war. \" the bloody pictures from odessa have shown us that we are just a few steps away from a military confrontation, \" he told reporters, noting that the conflict had reached a pitch \" that a short time ago we would not have considered possible. \" germany is advising its citizens — and particularly its journalists — to evacuate from ukraine's south and east, the ap reports. The council of europe is meeting today in vienna, though without much optimism. \" you cannot expect miracles, \" austria's foreign minister said, according to the bbc, but he said he expected the leaders to strongly back ukraine's may 25 presidential election. Indeed, francois hollande warned in a television interview that should that election not take place \" there would be chaos and the risk of civil war. \" at the moment, however, everything is quiet in the east and south, reuters reports, as both sides bury their dead. \" they shoot at us. Why? because we don't want to live with fascists? \" demanded one man at a kramatorsk funeral for a woman allegedly killed by ukrainian forces.

Ribeiro is said to be trying to copyright the dance and wants the two companies to stop using it in their games, per nbc. Meanwhile, instagram sensation backpack kid, who's known for doing \" the floss, \" is also suing the gaming companies for using his own moves, as is rapper 2 milly for the \" milly rock. \" ( at least no one appears to be getting hurt doing these dances. )",

The winslow pd warned residents in a facebook post monday not to leave purses or other valuables in their cars, and to report the incident to police if they are asked to cash a check for a stranger. \"it is believed that these folks have worked their way up to maine, \" says the police post. Three male alleged members of the gang who were arrested in florida friday have also been tied to gang-related car burglaries in louisiana over the past few weeks, wgno reports.

        "summary": "North korea today \" completely scrapped \" the armistice that held a tenuous peace on the peninsula for six decades, reports the washington post, even as american and south korean troops began the large-scale military drills pyongyang had warned them to abandon. The north is playing up its unpredictability, saying in a state-run newspaper today that with the armistice gone, \"no one can expect what will happen next. \" further heightening tensions: the red cross hotline the north uses to communicate with seoul has gone dead. \" we called at 9am and there was no response, \" explains a south korean official of the line, which it tries daily. The north has also threatened to cut off its hotline with un troops — and to nuke the united states. North korea, which is planning huge military exercises of its own, claims the us-south korea drills are a move to launch a nuclear war. Analysts believe pyongyang isn't capable of launching a nuclear strike on the us even if the regime was deranged enough to try. But some kind of attack along the disputed sea border with south korea is seen as a more realistic possibility, reports reuters. As threats fly back and forth, some south koreans are openly discussing obtaining nuclear weapons of their own. Pyongyang's nuclear test last month, its third, \" was for south korea what the cuban missile crisis was for the us, \" a professor at the korea national defense university tells the new york times. \" it has made the north korean threat seem very close and very real. \" the hotline-closing and scrapping of peace pacts have recent precedents, but the mood in seoul is tenser than it has been after previous outbursts from pyongyang, the bbc finds. North korea's tone is more belligerent, and people fear the regime is more willing to back its threats up with action. If pyongyang was enraged by fresh un sanctions last week, today will be more of the same as the un examines its appalling human rights record, the new york times reports. An investigator will present a report that is expected to lead to an inquiry into possible crimes against humanity.",

From what investigators can piece together, ornella and david steiner and their 9-year-old son, enzo, set out to walk a 4.6-mile-loop trail at the white sands national monument on tuesday but only took two 20-ounce bottles of water among them when authorities recommend a gallon each, cnn reports. The park recommends hiking during cooler hours, but the family set off at around 1pm on a day when temperatures topped 100f and failed to sign in at the entrance to the trail, which goes up and down through sand dunes and offers no shade whatsoever. The county sheriff tells the alamogordo daily news that ornella turned back first after slowing down but told the other two to continue. She died of heat-related illness on the way back to the car, and david also collapsed some 2,000 feet later and died after becoming disoriented, the sheriff says. He notes the boy, who was found alive next to his father's body, told police his \" father and mother would take one drink while they made the child take two swallows of water. \" the sheriff tells cnn that park employees on a routine patrol found ornella's body first, then searched for the father and son after looking through her camera for clues and seeing a photo of the two at the park entrance.

Anti-mine campaigner cindy mccain, wife of sen. John mccain, detonated the mine from behind a wall of sandbags. \" in a country like mozambique, the people have lived in fear most of their lives and children have been born in fear, \" she said later when handing medals to workers from the demining group halo. \" this gives the country back its land and the children can be safe now. \" decades of conflict left tens of thousands of mines strewn across the country, killing or maiming hundreds of civilians every year — even after the civil war ended in 1992 — and some had thought it would take centuries to rid the country of them, the new york times reports. In a statement, halo says its workers, using both manual and mechanical methods, had cleared 171,000 land mines over 22 years, helping communities to farm safely and helping the country to start rebuilding infrastructure and developing its economy. The group says mozambique's mine problem seemed unsolvable as recently as 2007 and it hopes the success will show other heavily mined countries the way forward.

It's a cottage industry that's now moving out of the cottage and into storefronts and online to offer platonic ( read: nonsexual ) snuggling for \" therapeutic \" purposes: the journal cites \" academic research \" that explains the \" physical and emotional perks to touch, \" including increased levels of the bonding hormone oxytocin, decreased heart rate, and stress reduction. Where cuddling gets controversial: snuggle pros aren't licensed, and some people are wary that such a service could lead to more \" unsavory \" customers seeking out sexual encounters, the journal notes. Businesses often have rules in place to keep things on the up-and-up: clients sign contracts noting what's acceptable cuddling, security cameras keep tabs, and lounge chairs are used instead of beds so customers don't get the wrong impression. Apparently there's a market for these services: the founder of the cuddle comfort website — \" the first and only website for finding a cuddle buddy \" — says it has 18,000 members; a proprietor of the free cuddlr app claims up to 10,000 people are using his service daily to find cuddle partners, according to the journal. However, caitlin dewey wrote previously for the washington post that she tried cuddlr and was \" severely creeped out \" — and that such services may lead to lawsuits or sexual assaults. \" people will use a geolocation app for sex, full-stop, \" she says. \" and no amount of small print or cautionary help text will change that. \" ( men can get more snuggly by using a \" cuddle spray. \" )",

Arthur buckel, 38 — who was eligible for parole in less than three weeks, per nj.com — was discovered missing from the bayside state prison unit of ancora psychiatric hospital in hammonton during a 6am headcount, reports the asbury park press. He was serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault, drug possession, and burglary, and was previously convicted of the aggravated manslaughter of a 10-month-old infant, whom a prosecutor says he hit \" out of frustration when the baby wouldn't stop crying. \" police believe buckel drove a stolen 2015 chevrolet silverado 60 miles north to a cvs pharmacy in barnegat, where surveillance video showed him buying gum and food on wednesday. Buckel — who also worked as a janitor in the prison, per nbc philadelphia — wasn't found at relatives ' homes nearby and hasn't surfaced since, police say, though they believe he may still be in the area. Dogs are helping with the search, made difficult by recent rain. A coast guard helicopter with a thermal imaging camera has also been employed. Authorities describe buckel as white, 5-feet-9 inches tall, 180 pounds, with light blue eyes, facial hair, and a small tattoo under his left eye. He was last seen wearing a bright yellow jacket and khaki pants. A police rep says buckel likely isn't armed but should be considered \" dangerous. \" area schools opened thursday with police officers on guard.",

        "summary": "A man's death while in police custody on the las vegas strip is making headlines, in part because of an officer's use of a neck restraint. Police say the incident began when the man approached two officers inside the venetian hotel and casino about 1am sunday, reports the ap. The officers say he was acting erratically, claiming that people were after him, and took off outside. They followed, spotted him trying to get into someone's pickup, and used a stun gun on him, but the officers say the man continued to fight them. One officer then punched him multiple times and used \"a department approved control technique called the lateral vascular neck restraint, \" per a police statement cited by the las vegas review-journal. The man, who was unarmed and has not been identified, lost consciousness and was pronounced dead at a hospital about 1: 40am. The incident is drawing comparisons to the death of eric garner in new york city, who could be heard telling police \" i can't breathe \" while in a chokehold. The department, however, says the restraint used is not a chokehold because, when deployed properly, it does not block a suspect's airway. Instead, it restricts the flow of blood to a person's brain by \" compressing arteries in the neck, \" per the washington post, which digs into the semantics via the national law enforcement training center. In short, the restraint is meant to be a safer alternative to a chokehold, though the aclu in nevada isn't making such distinctions. \" the incident of a man dying in police custody today is one more reason why the use of chokehold practices must stop, \" says the group's executive director. \" too many people have died as a result of this type of excessive force. \"",

            "Lateral vascular neck restraint ( lvnr ® ) the lvnr ® is the number one law enforcement system of neck restraint -- standing, kneeling or on the ground. If your agency is now using or considering the use of neck restraints for officer safety and subject control, then the copyrighted and us patent office registered nletc/kcmo pd lvnr ® is the one method you need to assess. It has been extensively field and medically tested and has proven to be safer, more effective, and less controversial than any other known neck restraint method. That is why the nletc/kcmo pd lvnr ® is the predominant method of neck control, and is now being adopted nationwide by those law enforcement agencies that teach ground defense/control systems. Agencies and trainers should avoid the use of single-level, or time limit approved neck restraint methods since their use has resulted in all the claims of excessive force, death, and resultant litigation involving neck restraint use. Combined arm, neck and body controls are not as effective for most officers as the direct, rear, neck-specific compression which requires minimum physical effort for lvnr ® vs. Maximum physical exertion for other methods. Our statistics show that 50 % of all subjects will cease resistance at level one with low-level compression on the sides of the neck; 25 % will comply at level two with medium compression on the neck;",

Neruda died in 1973 and was exhumed 40 years later; in late 2013, forensic test results showed no chemical agents in his bones. Now, an initial report drafted by spanish researchers and seen by reuters similarly finds no indication he was murdered. In reporting chile's reopening of the investigation, the bbc in january explained that a new round of tests would zero in on whether \" chemical agents caused any cellular or protein damage \"; the aim of prior testing was to look for remnants of poison. Reuters explains that three types of protein were identified in neruda's remains by universidad de murcia forensic experts: two proteins could be related to advanced prostate cancer; the experts were less sure about the other, but the report suggested it could have a natural source ( perhaps an infection, or something that arose from how his body was handled post-mortem ). The case isn't closed: an expert panel will weigh in, and a genomic analysis has yet to be completed.",

It had been put back to work during world war i in 1917, but was no match for the gigantic passenger ship. Now, a century later, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the coast guard have announced that they found the wreckage 150 miles northwest of los angeles during a routine survey, reports the ap. While all on board were rescued that day, the guard paid homage to the ship and its crew. A remotely operated vehicle caught footage of what remains of the ship last fall — mainly a steel skeleton covered with white anemones, reports live science. Historic photos helped researchers match the 11-foot bronze propeller and other features. While sea life has eaten away at the ship's hull and decks, a six-pound gun is still mounted at the starboard bow. The ship will likely be left alone, due in part to the us sunken military craft act of 2004, which prohibits disturbing or moving any part of the vessel. A coast guard commander calls the ship \" a symbol of hard work and sacrifice of previous generations to serve and protect our nation. \" ( some believe there's a shipwreck to be found in a california desert. )",

Officials said tuesday while announcing its discovery that strong currents and an abundance of sediment would make moving the ship too difficult.

        "summary": "Three years after winning the prestigious gold medal at the van cliburn international piano competition, pianist vadym kholodenko suffered the deaths of his two young children, for which his estranged wife has been charged with capital murder. It's just the latest tragedy to befall a cliburn winner, scott cantrell writes at the dallas morning news, citing what is known as \" the cliburn curse. \" in minor cases, the so-called curse resonates in the form of a pianist failing to live up to expectations or falling into a career slump. More ominous, though, is that three of the 16 winners since the competition began in 1962 have died at an early age. Steven de groote, winner of 1977 cliburn, for example, died from a complication of aids in 1989. He was 36. That same year, alexei sultanov won the gold medal in what one judge labeled \" a tremendous scandal. \" he was left partially paralyzed by a stroke in 2001 and died in his sleep in 2005 at age 35. Then in december 2014, 1985 winner josé feghali shot himself following a battle with depression. He was 53. \" some performers thrive for years in this rat race, but others become burned out and resentful. Lengthy periods away from home take tolls on families and relationships, too, \" writes cantrell. \" we didn't see a lot of vadym in moscow when he's traveling a lot, \" wife sofya tsygankova — a once-competitive pianist, per the washington post — told the fort worth star-telegram in 2014 after moving to texas. \" we wanted to be together, with vadym, to be a family. \"",

In the competition's preliminary round, vadym kholodenko, a 26-year-old native of ukraine, blew through a piece by the minimalist composer john adams, then turned to sergei rachmaninoff's piano sonata no. 1 in d minor — a challenging work that typically exceeds 30 minutes and grapples with the devil's influence on our lives.

Per the gossip site, his kids weren't there and didn't know the burial had occurred until yesterday. Why norway? neither kasem nor wife jean kasem has norwegian roots, and speculation in august was that jean was potentially trying to make it difficult to have the body exhumed to dodge his children's abuse accusations against her. Tmz runs with that thread, noting that the lapd is investigating following a police report filed by the kids that alleges their dad developed a fatal infection when jean moved him from california to washington state.

John kasich during his presidential bid is unconstitutional and will do \" irreparable injury \" to planned parenthood and its patients, a federal judge ruled friday the law effectively defunded planned parenthood by banning funds from the state's health department from going to any organization that provides abortions, nbc reports. But the funds in question weren't for abortion, but for programs including cancer screenings, std prevention, reduction of infant mortality, and sexual health education. Ohio \" cannot condition funding for these programs based on a recipient's exercise of the right to free speech or association outside of these programs, \" the judge ruled. \" this law would have been especially burdensome to communities of color and people with low income who already often have the least access to care this law would have made a bad situation worse, \" iris harvey, president of planned parenthood of greater ohio, said in a statement, per the ap. \" politicians have no business blocking patients from the care they need — and today the court stopped them in their tracks. \" ohio says it plans to appeal the ruling made by us district judge michael barrett, who was appointed by george w. Bush. ( in june, the supreme court struck down texas'tough restrictions on abortion clinics. )",

Though the government has yet to outline specific penalties for disobedient kids ( and parentdish notes there may not be any ), this bill isn't necessarily an empty threat: bbc news reported in 2005 that, thanks to a then-new law, married spanish men actually faced legal sanctions for refusing to do their share of the housework. Whatever may be in store for unruly spanish children, improved safety may be part of the country's vision — this law is just part of a wider child protection bill that would see the creation of a list of pedophiles who aren't allowed to work with kids.",

        "summary": "Wendy davis finds herself at the center of a firestorm this week, after being forced to admit that she'd embellished or omitted some details of what's generally been depicted as an inspiring personal biography. If you've missed the fracas, here are the cliffsnotes: the original story: davis has always said she was divorced at 19, and she raised two daughters in a mobile home, before eventually attending texas christian university and then harvard. But on sunday the dallas morning news reported that davis actually divorced at 21, not 19, that she lived in the mobile home for only a few months before moving into an apartment, and that she'd soon thereafter gotten a lot of financial help from her second husband, jeff davis, who helped her pay for college, and took care of her kids while she attended harvard. When they divorced, jeff won custody of the kids, and wendy was ordered to pay child support. \" a lot of what she says is true, \" jeff davis says. \" the first 21 years were about working one, two, and three jobs, trying to get through, raising a kid. … she got a break. Good things happen. \" davis'response: \" my language should be tighter, \" davis acknowledged in an interview with the paper. \" i ' m learning about using broader, looser language. I need to be more focused on the detail. \" when likely gubernatorial opponent greg abbott released a statement saying she \" systematically, intentionally, and repeatedly deceived texans, \" davis responded by saying the attacks wouldn't work \" because my story is the story of millions of texas women who know the strength it takes when you're young, alone, and a mother. \" the reaction: \" if anything, the fact that we are only just learning the ' fuller version ' of davis ' biography says less about her than it does about the media that have lavished her with adoring coverage, \" writes andrew stiles at the national review, noting how slow some outlets were to report on the story. But these \" fabrications \" aren't \" the sort of egregious falsehoods that have ended political careers. \" besides, a host of politicians, from marco rubio to elizabeth warren, to president obama himself have run into similar biographical embarrassments, points out nia-malika henderson at the washington post. \" the bottom line is this: people who liked wendy davis before the more complicated story of her background emerged will like her all the same.

For his part, seeger says \" it is required by law \" to set money aside until medical liens are worked out, and \" the majority had $ 0 deducted from their awards \" by liens. Yet other class-action settlements, like one related to the 9/11 attacks, apparently had such protections for victims. Meanwhile, plaintiffs like gordon can appeal their finding for an extra $ 1,000. \" i ' m not giving up, \" she says, \" because my mother deserves this money. \" ( even youth football can hurt memory later in life, one study says. )",

The hill reports that sen. Lindsey graham, a prominent, frequent, and vociferous trump critic, defended trump's use of \" pocahontas, \" saying politicians need to be able to take jokes. \" you know she started all of this, \" he told reporters. \" i don't refer to her as pocahontas. I can see why she would be offended, absolutely, \" he said. \" but given this contest, if this bothers you, you need to get out of politics. \" the washington post has more on gop reaction to the controversy, which comes as the uproar over trump's judge remarks was just beginning to die down. \" get used to it, \" pollster whit ayres says to his fellow republicans. \" this is your life for the next five months. \" in a cnn interview friday, mitt romney denounced trump and said he was seriously considering voting libertarian. \" trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny, all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of america, \" warned romney. \" mitt romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog, \" tweeted trump on saturday morning. \" now he calls me racist, \" he added, \" but i ' m the least racist person there is. \"",

The credit rating agency downgraded 15 major financial firms today in a move that is sure to hurt their bottom lines and rattle markets, the new york times reports. Moody's knocked credit suisse down by three levels, morgan stanley by two, and left bank of america and citigroup just two ranks above junk, reports bloomberg. Jpmorgan and goldman sachs also went down two notches. The downgrades are a major blow to banks, which are already struggling to deal with regulations, a struggling us economy, and a sovereign debt crisis in europe. But moody's was determined to be rigorous after going easy on financial firms before the financial crisis. Affected banks will face higher borrowing costs and damaged core business in areas like derivatives. They will also go on offense, trying to convince customers that moody's has overreacted: \" we believe the ratings still do not fully reflect the key strategic actions we have taken, \" said morgan stanley in a press release.",

        "summary": "Bad news if your mother was obese or overweight while she was pregnant with you: you're more likely to die young, according to a new study. Researchers looked at health records for more than 37,000 people born in scotland who are now between the ages of 34 and 61, and found that those born to obese women were 35 % more likely to die before age 55, the bbc reports. They also had a 29 % higher chance of experiencing heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular issues, usa today reports. The effects were more modest, but still increased, among those born to overweight women; the results held up regardless of the baby's weight at birth. The study is particularly important now, one ob/gyn explains, because obesity during pregnancy has increased 70 % in the us over the past 10 years. But researchers aren't sure why the effect is seen. It could have something to do with genes, or with \" overnourished \" fetuses developing problems while in the womb. But there could be other factors as well, such as whether the babies grew to be overweight themselves or whether shared poor diets in childhood played a role, according to us news &amp; world report.",

The two people killed were today named as mayci breaux, 21, and jillian johnson, 33.

There is still no evidence tying williams to the murder, but snyder says authorities have a \"strong circumstantial case \" against him. Snyder says todd's daughter was \" around \" for the murder of her mother, though no other details were given.

        "summary": "President trump and chinese president xi jinping arrived separately at palm beach international airport on thursday, causing major traffic headaches for locals, but more importantly heading to mar-a-lago to meet for the first time, the palm beach post reports. While trump is warning everyone to temper expectations for the meeting — a prelude to more serious discussions down the road, he says — it's unlikely the visit will end without both presidents addressing north korea and trade. Here's what else you need to know: trump wants to be aggressive with xi during their first private meeting, especially when it comes to north korea and the trade deficit, the new york times reports. But just how aggressive is a matter of \" fierce debate \" among white house advisers. Reuters reports that the two presidents couldn't have more different personalities, and the biggest concern among the chinese is that the \" stormy \" trump will do something to publicly embarrass the \" measured \" xi. In an impressive gimmick, the bbc literally runs down the abcs of the trump-xi meeting. For example b is for \" bashing \" while z is for \" zero sum game. \" ( it couldn't come up with anything for y, though. ) usa today reports there will be no golf played during xi's visit to mar-a-lago. The chinese president hates golf, believing it represents \" corruption, cronyism, and the excesses of capitalism. \" contrary to popular belief, trump actually has the upper hand in this week's meeting, according to the hill. Not true, argues the guardian, which reports xi \" holds all the cards. \" while the meeting between xi and trump isn't expected to have an impact on financial markets, one investment strategist tells forbes \" anything can happen \" thanks to trump's well-known \" animosity for china. \"",

He's a professor at the university of california, san diego school of medicine and school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences. \" so we thought -- what if we take advantage of left-behind skin chemistry to tell us what kind of lifestyle this person has? \" dorrestein said in a university news release. Dorrestein and colleagues took swabs from four areas on the cellphones of 39 healthy adults. \" by analyzing the molecules they've left behind on their phones,"

Hundreds of women were victimized in the case, campus security director skip homiak says. The suspect is ex-doctoral candidate javier mendiola-soto, now expelled; he has reportedly acknowledged downloading some 1,500 videos of victims, some of whom were recorded multiple times, homiak notes. Counseling has been made available to all the victims, he adds, per the news journal. Mendiola-soto, 38, only used two cameras, but he moved them all over campus over a two-year period, says homiak. A woman spotted one of the cameras last month, he notes. The suspect also allegedly put cameras in a goodwill store and in his own bathroom; he reportedly had female roommates. Mendiola-soto, of mexico, has been charged with 21 counts of privacy violation, and he's had his visa revoked, cnn reports. He's likely to be deported to mexico as a result of prosecution after he's served any sentence, homiak says.",
