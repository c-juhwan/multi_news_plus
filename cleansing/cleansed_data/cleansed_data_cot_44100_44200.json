The entries show a yearning for freedom but also demonstrate the amount of control phillip garrido wielded over her, reports msnbc. \" how can i ever tell him i want to be free, \" she wrote at one point. \" free to come and go as i please.... Free to say i have a family. I will never cause him pain if it's in my power to prevent it. Free. \" another entry, from 2004: \"it feels like i ' m sinking.... This is supposed to be my life to do with what i like... But once again he has taken it away. How many times is he allowed to take it away from me? \" dugard, now 29 and with two children fathered by garrido, was moved last week to a safe house within driving distance of the antioch, calif., residence where she was imprisoned. A church has offered to pay her rent for a year, sources tell the contra costa times, but dugard is still strapped, and unlikely to get much aid from the state. \"let's be praying for them, \" one church member says. \"it's as bad a situation as we've seen. \"",

            "New court documents give an eerie glimpse of jaycee dugard's 18 years in captivity at the hands of alleged kidnappers, with diary entries by her painting a picture of growing despair. \" it feels like i ' m sinking. I ' m afraid i want control of my life... This is supposed to be my life to do with what i like... But once again he has taken it away, \" dugard writes in a july 5, 2004, entry. \" how many times is he allowed to take it away from me? i ' m afraid he doesn't see how the things he says makes me a prisoner. \" the journal entries are included in court documents filed thursday by the el dorado county district attorney to oppose a motion by phillip garrido's lawyer for information on the current whereabouts of dugard, who is in seclusion. Dugard was abducted from the street where she lived in south lake tahoe, calif., on june 10, 1991, when she was 11 years old. Prosecutors allege phillip garrido and his wife, nancy, kept the girl in their hidden backyard compound, where she was sexually assaulted and imprisoned for the next 18 years. Garrido allegedly fathered two children by dugard during her ordeal. Dugard, now, 29, was found by police in late august. She and her children have been staying at a secret location, and prosecutors say she does not want any further contact from the garridos. Acting as a family? public defender susan gellman has asked the district attorney to provide photos of dugard's daughters, videos of interviews with the girls, and permission to talk with dugard in preparation for trial. Gellman's court request claims the garridos, dugard and her two daughters acted as a family in recent years. \" they took vacations together; they went to the library together; they ran a family business together, \" the defense motion said. \" the children home schooled. They kept pets and had a garden. They took care of ailing family members together. They had special names for each other. \" however, the district attorney's response filed thursday paints a different picture, saying dugard and her children were not part of a \" family, \" but rather captives. Phillip garrido is seen with his court appointed attorney, susan gellman, during his arraignment on 29 felony counts stemming from the abduction of jaycee dugard, in the el dorado superior court in placerville, calif.",

The troubled actress allegedly ran a red light and then stopped in the middle of a los angeles intersection around 3: 30am sunday; a chp officer pulled her over and found that she couldn't complete field sobriety tests, a spokesman tells the new york daily news. She was arrested for driving under the influence of a stimulant, tmz reports; sources say that stimulant was adderall. The sources say a doctor prescribed it, but that bynes was \" out of it \" and \" disheveled \" when she was arrested. Sources also tell the gossip site bynes has been smoking quite a bit of marijuana lately and has gone off her medications for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Her parents apparently let their conservatorship over her lapse, thinking she was doing better, but others believe this is not the case and say \" things started going haywire \" since she moved out of their home. She is still on probation for a reckless-driving conviction.",

He says he was aiming to beat the record set last year: a $ 47.30 frap with a mere 40 shots and a long list of additives ( from mocha drizzle to caramel brulee topping to strawberries ) that raised the price while seriously lowering the taste. How andrew managed the feat: he says he got the baristas at the unidentified starbucks to agree to help him break the record, and he brought a mammoth glass to help him in that quest, a 128-ouncer. Seattle weekly talked to a starbucks rep who was unaware of the feat but points out that pictures from andrew's twitter feed reveal his location as dallas. \" this type of beverage order is totally excessive and not something we encourage people to do, \" she says. \" nor is it safe. \" to wit, consumerist estimates that andrew's drink contained 4.5 grams of caffeine, and points to a 2012 popular science article that suggested 10 grams of caffeine could kill an adult.

Police say alexandria duval, 37, was driving a ford explorer that went through a rock wall, plunging 200 feet onto rocks on may 29. She was flown to a hospital in critical condition, while her passenger, sister anastasia duval, was pronounced dead at the scene, reports the ap. Prosecutors say the crash was no accident. Witnesses saw the twins arguing in the suv with \" the passenger pulling the hair of the driver, who appeared to be in a rage, \" per kitv. One witness says alexandria then accelerated into the rock wall from a dead stop, per khon. Vehicle records show she made no attempt to brake, investigators say. Authorities add alexandria duval was attempting to flee hawaii when she was arrested friday on second-degree murder charges. Her lawyer, however, says she was only \" making plans to return home to attend her sister's funeral. \" he adds his client — who has pleaded not guilty to murder and is being held without bail — \" did not try to harm herself or the person she most loved and was closest to in the world, \" and the accident was only a \" heart-shattering \" tragedy.

They studied 121 people who had taken cannabis at least once, reported paranoid thoughts sometime during the past month, and had not been diagnosed with a mental illness. Then, in a random and blind test, two-thirds received an intravenous dose of thc ( equivalent to a \" strong joint, \" medical news today notes ) while the rest got a placebo. Then paranoia was comprehensively tracked, and half of the subjects who'd received thc experienced it, compared to 30 % of those who got the placebo. \" that is, one in five had an increase in paranoia that was directly attributable to the thc, \" the researchers write. The study shows that \" paranoia isn't tenuously linked to thc: for a significant number of people, it's a direct result. \" the researchers also found that the thc produced other negative mental health effects, including anxiety, negative thoughts, and lowered mood. Oh, and it also caused \" anomalous experiences \" like echoing thoughts and a distorted sense of time, sounds, and colors. Trying to make sense of those experiences while already in a vulnerable state ( thanks to the lowered mood ) could lead to the paranoia, the researchers suggest. The good news? subjects ' paranoia decreased as the drug left their bloodstream. ( cannabis is also genetically linked to schizophrenia. )",

In england and wales about 13.5 % of 16 to 24 years olds have used cannabis in the past year, and almost one in three people will try it at least once during their lifetime. Of the 6.4 % of adults aged 16-59 who reported using cannabis in the past year, over 40 % said they used it at least once a month. Given that a significant chunk of the population are consuming the stuff, it is perhaps not surprising that most people believe the risks involved in getting stoned are more or less equivalent to the risks from getting drunk. Us president barack obama seems to be one of them: \"i smoked pot as a kid, and i view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that i smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life, \" he explained to the new yorker. \" i don't think it is more dangerous than alcohol. \" certainly many people use cannabis without adverse effects, and indeed with",

The opposition \" rejects lending legitimacy to a referendum that will definitely lead to more sedition and division, \" says a spokesman. The proposed constitution isn't actually much more religious than the old one, according to outside experts — but opposition activists say it paves the way for any islamist parliamentary majority to limit individual rights. More demonstrations are planned for tomorrow and friday, even as morsi offered a carrot: he today rolled back a wide-ranging tax increase on items ranging from soda and beer to cigarettes and oil — levies that were announced only yesterday, reports the financial times.

Bloomberg reports that the semi-automatic weapons are out of stock at many walmarts across the country, including those in pennsylvania, kansas, and alabama. Walmart sells about 10 types of the rifles, though it removed a description and photo of the bushmaster ar-15 — the gun used at sandy hook elementary — from its online store after the shootings. Guns are big money-makers at walmart, but the chain doesn't disclose exact numbers. ( one of its black friday sales was $ 50 off a sig sauer m400, putting it at $ 867. ) in addition to the surging gun sales, bloomberg says prices of handgun magazines are rising quickly on ebay. Four glock magazines were going for $ 118 today, up from $ 45 the day before the shooting. Shooter adam lanza had a glock with him, too.

The building is near, but not in, the pentagon; the mail was addressed to defense secretary jim mattis and adm. John richardson, the chief of naval operations. After the poison was detected, all mail received at the mail-screening facility monday was put under quarantine, a pentagon spokesperson says. The fbi took possession of the envelopes in question and is leading the investigation, including conducting further tests, the wall street journal reports. The mail initially caused suspicions because it contained a sticky substance, per a defense official. Also tuesday, a package addressed to ted cruz's houston campaign headquarters caused a lockdown, the ap reports. A spokesperson for the republican senator says the package was opened in the lobby and two people — not members of cruz's staff — were exposed to a \" white powdery substance \" and taken to a hospital. Their conditions were unknown. The fire department tweeted that all tests for hazardous substances came back negative. The lockdown has since been lifted.",

Emergency personnel found makayla, who lived nearby with her mother and older siblings, \" lying on the ground with a gunshot to the chest, \" mccoig says. When the boy's mother was told what happened, \" she slammed the door, locked it, and we never seen her after that, \" the neighbor adds, per the guardian. Makayla's mother, meanwhile, says the boy had a history of \" just being mean to her. I had to go to the principal about him, and then he quit for a while. \" the superintendent of a juvenile detention center says the \" very tiny \" boy, who weighs about 55 pounds, is being kept in a regular \" pod \" with other juveniles aged 12 to 17 until a hearing oct. 28, reports cnn. He's the youngest person to be held there on a murder charge during the superintendent's 44-year career. \" it is the most pitiful case on both sides, \" he says. Meanwhile, a heart-wrenching photo on twitter shows one of makayla's puppies on her porch, apparently waiting for her to come home.",

        "summary": "A record 6 feet of snow has dumped down on boston in the past few weeks, and today looks to show that there's more where that came from. It's gotten so bad that the city has reached out to the general public and scientists alike for fresh ideas on what to do with all the piles of plowed snow — some of which reach 40 feet into the freezing sky, reports city lab. \" we're not at a public-safety concern yet, but we will be if we keep getting snow like this, \" boston mayor martin walsh warned on monday. These piles of snow in vacant lots, or \" snow farms, \" can hang around until spring, while melting machines that filter out street debris and redirect the melt toward storm drains are costly, not to mention require lots of gas to run. A leading idea being debated is to go back to the days of yore and dump the snow straight into boston harbor. While some say all the salt shouldn't be poured into the water, local environmental agencies and even oceanographers tend to agree that there's not enough to seriously impact the water's salinity — less than 1 % of what's already in the water has this year been dumped onto city streets, and the folks at popular science are all for this old-school alternative. And while cnbc reports that boston area snow plowers are making a killing this year, all the snow is putting quite a dent in the local economy, especially hitting small-business owners who see considerably less foot traffic. One estimate suggests that a single-day shutdown costs the city $ 265 million, no matter where that snow ultimately goes. ( even the wind was gusting at up to 70mph in parts of massachusetts. )",

After burying four of the bodies in the saddleworth moor, the pair became known as the moors murderers. But brady never revealed where 12-year-old victim keith bennett's body was buried, and the boy's elderly mother passed away without ever knowing his final resting place. As his health began failing, brady continued to deny requests to reveal the whereabouts of the body. \" i would beg him to do the right thing on his deathbed and tell us where keith is, \" terry kilbride, whose brother john was also murdered by brady, told the sun hours before brady's death. The head of the local cold case unit tells the bbc brady's death will \" not change \" the effort to find keith's remains. Prior to his death, brady was in poor health, with chest and lung problems. He recently made headlines for demanding his right to die. His multiple appeals to be removed from a hospital and placed in prison in his native scotland, where he wouldn't be force-fed through a feeding tube, were refused.

The russian leader has approved the sale of an s-300 surface-to-air missile defense system to iran in an $ 800 million deal that russia's foreign minister says was made in a \" spirit of goodwill in order to encourage progress in the talks, \" reports the new york times. Sources tell reuters that russia has also started supplying iran with grain and construction materials under an oil barter deal that could be worth up to $ 20 billion. Russia agreed in 2010 to suspend the sale of the missile system, which military experts say would make it very difficult for the us or israel to strike iranian nuclear facilities. A senior us marine corps aviator tells the daily beast that the s-300 would be a \" game changer \" for modern aircraft like the f-15. \" that thing is a beast and you don't want to get near it, \" he says. The white house has objected to the sale, which analysts see as part of a pattern of moscow renewing ties with regimes hostile to the us.

Moscow russia paved the way on monday for missile system deliveries to iran and started an oil-for-goods swap, signaling that moscow may have a head-start in the race to benefit from an eventual lifting of sanctions on tehran. The moves come after world powers, including russia, reached an interim deal with iran this month on curbing its nuclear program.

Covers reports oddsmakers had the patriots as 10-point favorites when betting opened last sunday. The spread was down to 9 points most places wednesday morning, according to cbs sports. Then word got out that brady hurt his throwing hand when he collided with a running back during practice wednesday. Cue the chaos. Brady didn't practice thursday and didn't make any throws during friday's practice — at least not while media was present, yahoo sports reports. He was, however, seen wearing a glove on this throwing hand — something he stopped doing for performance reasons years ago, according to the boston herald. By thursday evening, most sportsbooks had dropped the patriots to 7.5-point favorites. One bookmaker even took the patriots off the board for a time to allow \" due diligence \" around brady's injury. If new backup quarterback brian hoyer is forced to replace brady as the starter sunday, oddsmakers say the patriots would still be favored — but not by much. Patriots running back dion lewis, at least, says that won't happen. He tells phil perry of nbc sports boston that \" nobody's really worried. \"",

Raymond reinke's crimes drew national attention when at least one yellowstone visitor caught his interaction with a bison on video. Reinke, of pendleton, oregon, pleaded guilty during a federal court appearance in mammoth, wyoming, where cases from yellowstone park are heard. Us magistrate judge mark carman sentenced him to 60 days in jail for harassing wildlife, 60 days for interfering with law enforcement, and 10 days for disorderly conduct. He was given credit for 21 days served. Reinke, 55, is banned from grand teton, yellowstone, and glacier national parks for a five-year probationary period during which he is not allowed to drink alcohol. His planned chemical dependency treatment is now court-ordered. \" i ' m sorry to the buffalo. He didn't deserve what i did to him, \" reinke said, per abc fox montana.",

The bbc and guardian had earlier reported that the 72-year-old bosnian croat — an ex-military commander convicted four years ago of persecuting and killing muslims during the bosnian war in the mid- ' 90s — disrupted his appeals hearing after he heard his 20-year sentence in prison would be upheld. \" i am not a war criminal, \" he reportedly yelled upon hearing the news, just after he got up from his seat and appeared to drink something from a tiny glass or bottle. His attorney then cried out: \" my client says he has taken poison. \" the bbc reports a \" state of confusion \" in the courtroom followed, as the judge immediately halted proceedings and medical help was called for; the ap notes cops, emergency services personnel, and what looked to be firefighters with oxygen tanks were all on the scene. The new york times cites an anonymous tribunal official who said praljak's body was taken off court premises after he was pronounced dead; croatian state tv said he died at a hospital in the hague, per un-ided sources said to be close to praljak. The un tribunal is the same one that last week sentenced ratko mladic to life in prison for his own atrocities during the war. Praljak, one of six former bosnian politicians or military bigwigs set to hear their appeal verdicts wednesday, was accused of crimes that included destroying a centuries-old ottoman bridge in mostar, per the independent.

It's been used to justify austerity pushes around the globe. But reinhart and rogoff have always refused to actually reveal their data, and now a new paper has found that they excluded years of inconvenient data and made various other errors and weird choices that, when corrected, show that average gdp actually comes out positive, writes alex pareene at salon. \" this is important — it should in fact be a big deal — because reinhart and rogoff have been the ultimate authorities \" for austerity fans, he writes. \" it is sort of shocking, to me, that respected economists can release a widely cited paper without just putting their damn excel spreadsheet online. \" reinhart and rogoff have tried to defend themselves, but not very convincingly, writes josh barro at bloomberg. \" it is reminiscent of the ' fake but accurate'defense of the forged memos \" questioning president bush's national guard service.

But a new working paper from economists at the university of massachusetts says reinhart and rogoff's findings are created by bad methodology. They seem to have a point. Thomas herndon, michael ash and robert pollin say that the reinhart-rogoff finding of sharply lower average growth in high-debt countries rests on three errors: a bad weighting method, inexplicable exclusion of data from certain countries and years, and an excel coding error. After fixing those problems, they find that \"average gdp growth at public debt/gdp ratios over 90 percent is not dramatically different than when debt/gdp ratios are lower. \" yesterday's defenses from reinhart and rogoff are most notable for what they do not contain: a defense of the methodology that herndon and his colleagues criticize.

But she also said they accurately reflect the thoughts of the commander, lt. Col. Jerry b. Killian, and other memorandums she typed for him about mr. Bush. \" the information in them is correct, \" the woman, marian carr knox, now 86, said in an interview at her home here. \" but i doubt, \" she said, pausing, \" it's not anything that i wrote because there are terms in there that are not used by guards, the format wasn't the way we did it.

            "Ken rogoff and carmen reinhart have become known for warning that debt-to-gdp ratios over 90 percent are linked to poor economic growth. But a new working paper from economists at the university of massachusetts says reinhart and rogoff's findings are created by bad methodology. They seem to have a point. Thomas herndon, michael ash and robert pollin say that the reinhart-rogoff finding of sharply lower average growth in high-debt countries rests on three errors: a bad weighting method, inexplicable exclusion of data from certain countries and years, and an excel coding error. After fixing those problems, they find that \"average gdp growth at public debt/gdp ratios over 90 percent is not dramatically different than when debt/gdp ratios are lower. \" yesterday's defenses from reinhart and rogoff are most notable for what they do not contain: a defense of the methodology that herndon and his colleagues criticize. Instead, they make two",

The saga began when the 21-year-old allegedly stole $ 15,000 from a friend in florida, and police later saw him hit a car at an intersection — while driving a stolen lexus. Police gave chase when he sped off and hit the highway to boca raton; he eventually ended up on a dead-end road, the sun sentinel reports. That's when police say he promptly crashed into a fire hydrant, hit an officer's car twice, then got stuck in mud. After breaking away from cops on foot, he ended up at candace noonan's back door, wpbf reports. Claiming to be a thirsty landscaper, pinedo-velapatino asked for water. And while noonan obliged, he sprawled on her living room floor to play with her cats. \" it was odd, very odd. He was stroking my cat. It almost looked like he either was on drugs or he was mentally handicapped, \" she tells the station. He eventually fled as cops closed in, ending up in a canal nearby, where police fished him out of the water. Pinedo-velapatino now faces a slew of charges and claims he stole the money to pay his mom back, the palm beach post reports.

The purpose of the threat was to \" make an officer think twice before shooting so fast and killing an unarmed person, \" she added. A police department spokesman wouldn't comment on the observer's threat, but did say the shooting was under investigation. Police chief william mcmanus tells cbs news that officers were following scott, who was wanted on felony drug and weapons warrants. Officer john lee approached scott as he was walking away from his car. Lee told scott to raise his hands. Scott spun around, and lee, fearing for his life, fatally shot him in the chest, says the chief. Lee is on paid administrative leave.",

Rather than \" hunkering down \" with congressional leaders behind closed doors for weeks — a strategy that damaged him in 2011 — aides tell the new york times that obama will travel outside of dc in an effort to ramp up public support for his plan, which combines spending cuts with higher taxes on the rich, with the ultimate goal of breaking through dc's partisan gridlock. ( john boehner seems like he might be agreeable to that. ) talks are scheduled to begin friday, but obama will meet with corporate executives on wednesday in an effort to regain support in the business world, and will take his case to the public sometime after thanksgiving. Many business leaders are looking for a budget compromise similar to what obama favors, and the president thinks he can use them to convince congressional republicans to see things his way. Both the times and bloomberg note that on yesterday's talk shows, republican lawmakers voiced a newfound openness to working with obama, even including the possibility of raising taxes without actually increasing tax rates for the wealthy.

A twitter user was among the first to draw attention to numerous misspellings ( jamaica plain is jamaca plain, for instance ) on one shirt displaying a map of boston neighborhoods, but that was just the beginning. The shirt also omitted the mission hill neighborhood and replaced chinatown, downtown, and a few other neighborhoods with a single non-existent one dubbed \" central, \" reports boston.com. Perhaps worst of all, it spelled southie as southy, notes boston.com. Misspellings were also found on two other boston neighborhood shirts in target's \" local pride \" line. One even mentions cambridge, which is its own city across the charles river from boston, reports the boston globe. A rep for target says all of the \" incorrect boston items \" will now be removed from target stores and its website. \" we apologize for any disappointment that this may have caused, \" the rep says, adding, \" we love to be able to carry products that are reflective of the local community. \" this isn't target's first misstep with bostonians. In 2015, it drew flak for asking a new york artist to design boston-themed shirts, per the globe, which found that one of the shirts that came out of that partnership has, yes, a typo on it.

It was shut down when the soviet union collapsed; the new incarnation is not nearly as big a deal... And it also has nothing to do with the website mccain wrote for, pravda.ru, which is actually more like a tabloid. Amusingly, mccain's rep tells politico the senator submitted his piece to both pravdas and was hoping both would run it. Alas, that was not to be. But on to the column itself, headlined \" russians deserve better than putin. \" in it, mccain argues that he is actually \" more pro-russian than the regime that misrules you today \" because he respects russians ' \" dignity \" and \" right to self-determination. \" he takes issue with the russian government's hard line on dissenting opinions: \" they punish dissent and imprison opponents. They rig your elections. They control your media. \" he's also not happy with the country's anti-gay laws or the pussy riot debacle.

Two more patients died in hospitals following the evacuation of the rehabilitation center at hollywood hills on wednesday, bringing the total number of dead to eight. Three patients died at the facility earlier wednesday, while three others died in hospitals. The deceased ranged in age from 71 to 99 and their causes of death are not yet clear. But the medical director at a hospital across the street from the facility, where evacuees were taken, says most were treated for \" respiratory distress, dehydration, and heat-related issues, \" per local 10. He adds at least 12 other patients are in emergency care. The rehabilitation center has been barred from admitting patients as agencies investigate. Hollywood police are also conducting a criminal investigation. The facility has previously faced issues regarding care and safety and a pending lawsuit claims employees \" failed to properly monitor and supervise the care and treatment \" of a patient who suffered infections, sepsis, and dehydration, report the washington post and miami herald.

The area has been dry for days but heavy rains are expected to hit soon, potentially driving water levels up, thwarting rescue efforts, or even flooding the dry spot the boys fled to after heavy rains cut them off from the cave system's exit on june 23, the bbc reports. \" we are racing against time before we found them, \" chiang rai governor narongsak osotthanakorn said early thursday. \" now we are racing against water. \" experts believe waiting for the waters to recede could be the safest option, but that could take months. The boys are getting diving lessons and unless efforts to find a shaft in the jungle above the cave succeed, rescuers are expected to try to get the boys out within days, starting with those best able to make the difficult journey through narrow tunnels. The military has been running hundreds of pumps in an effort to lower the water level enough for the boys to simply walk out, though one major chamber remains flooded to the ceiling, the guardian reports. Rescuers are also trying to install an internet cable so the boys can communicate with their parents. \" it's like he has been given a new life, \" the mother of a 16-year-old in the cave tells the ap. She says if he makes it out, she will never let him go near a cave again.",

Both the ukraine government and pro-russian separatists have denied responsibility. A ukraine official asserts that a missile system known as a buk launcher brought down the plane, and he alleges that russia supplied it to separatists. The ap reports seeing something similar to a buk system this week in separatist-held territory, but that's not exactly damning proof — a weapons expert points out that ukraine forces also have buk systems. It will take a while for investigators to make an official determination, though cnbc cites unconfirmed reports that the plane's black-box data recorder has been found, which should speed things up. Meanwhile, joe biden, who said the plane was \" blown out of the sky, \" spoke to ukraine president petro poroshenko and offered us help with the investigation, reports reuters. Poroshenko is calling the plane crash a \" terrorist act, \" notes the new york times, though president obama used the phrase \" terrible tragedy \" to describe it in his initial comments. No word yet on whether any americans were among the 298 people aboard. All are feared dead.",

            "Swimsuit-clad model kate upton dives and floats, not in water, but through the air for a new spread in sports illustrated. Upton flew on a zero gravity corporation flight to model new bikini and one-piece fashions in weightlessness for sports illustrated's 2014 swimsuit issue, which hit newsstands today ( feb. 18 ). Upton's weightless experience shows what it might be like to model while in outer space, according to zero-g officials. \" the zero-g experience was really exhilarating for everyone involved, \" mj day, editor of the sports illustrated swimsuit issue, said in a statement. \" we have been almost everywhere in the past 50 years with si swimsuit, but we have never done anything like this. It was certainly the most out-of-the-box shoot. Once again, kate surprised us all with how she handled modeling in weightlessness. \" [ fun in zero gravity: a weightless photo gallery ] in a video taken during the shoot on march 18, 2013, upton can be seen floating through the air as photographers and the crew work to capture the model posing gracefully on the other side of the aircraft. The magazine unveiled the photos online and announced them via twitter @si_swimsuit. \" one small step for swimsuit, one giant leap for mankind, \" someone adapting astronaut neil armstrong's famous words as he stepped on the surface of the moon for the first time, said at the end of the sports illustrated video. Zero-g passengers experience weightlessness as pilots flying the company's modified boeing 727 fly in parabolic arcs while thousands of feet above earth's surface.

Liu, the country's most prominent political prisoner, was first put behind bars in 1989 in connection with the tiananmen square pro-democracy protests. His fourth and last prison sentence, for inciting subversion thanks to his work advocating for more human rights and political reforms in china, began in 2008, buzzfeed reports. He was awarded the nobel in 2010. Liu, who had been hospitalized for advanced liver cancer that was diagnosed in may, died of multiple organ failure. China had said he was receiving the best care in the country and that he wasn't medically cleared to travel abroad for treatment, but doctors had recently disagreed. The white house had renewed calls for liu's release this week, the guardian reports. He died in a hospital in china, still under police custody, making him the second nobel peace prize winner to die while in custody. Friends, supporters, and fellow activists are expressing their grief over his death, with some calling for liu's wife, liu xia, to be allowed to leave china, the ap reports. She was put under house arrest after liu won the nobel, despite having been convicted of no crime; china was angered by the prize being awarded to liu. Liu was a visiting scholar at new york's columbia university when he returned to china in may 1989 to join the movement challenging the communist party; his first prison sentence lasted almost two years. He was detained again in 1995 after writing a plea for political reform, then again later that year for co-authoring another paper regarding problems in china. That sentence lasted three years.",

        "summary": "Over the past few decades, tornadoes have been shifting — decreasing in oklahoma, texas, and kansas, but spinning up more in states along the mississippi river and farther east, a new study shows. Scientists aren't quite certain why, the ap notes. The study, which looked at changes since 1979, found everywhere east of the mississippi, except the west coast of florida, is seeing some increase in tornado activity. Tornado activity is increasing most in mississippi, arkansas, tennessee, louisiana, alabama, kentucky, missouri, illinois, indiana, wisconsin, iowa, and parts of ohio and michigan, per a study in the climate and atmospheric science journal. The four deadliest states for tornadoes are alabama, missouri, tennessee, and arkansas, per the noaa. There's been a slight dip in the great plains, with the biggest drop in eastern and central texas. Even with the decline, texas still gets the most tornadoes. The shift may be deadly, as the area with increasing tornado activity is bigger and home to more people, per study lead author victor gensini. He adds that in those places, more people live in vulnerable mobile homes, and tornadoes happen more at night. Gensini and tornado scientist harold brooks examined \" significant tornado parameters, \" a measurement of the key ingredients of tornado conditions that looks at differences between wind speed and direction at different altitudes, how unstable the air is, and humidity. The more of those three ingredients, the more likely tornadoes will form. Overall, there's a slight increase in tornado activity, but it's not nearly like what's happening in the east, gensini says. Why is this happening? \" we don't know, \" he says, though \" this is super-consistent with climate change. \" ( how rv parks are affected. )",

The target audience: the 14 million visitors who flock to the 850-year-old landmark each year, a huge chunk of them from the us. \" the cathedral is a big part of paris ' history but also a big part of american history in the city, \" michel picard, the head of the friends of notre dame foundation, told the local in june. The foundation, created last year by the archbishop of paris, gained tax-exempt status in the us in may, and the charity is planning a fundraising trip next spring to several us cities, including boston, chicago, and la. The french government contributes about $ 2.4 million annually for the upkeep of the double-towered edifice, an amount that can't fund the major restoration needed. A \" stone cemetery \" of toppled masonry is a testament to the \" serious risk \" the cathedral is facing if repairs don't happen soon to the worn and degraded exterior, picard tells reuters. Otherwise, \" we ' ll risk seeing parts of the exterior structure begin to fall, \" he says. Time looks at two reasons for the deterioration: traffic-related \" pollution is the biggest culprit, \" per the architect in chief of historic monuments in france. The other is a bit counter-intuitive: victor hugo's the hunchback of notre dame drew attention to the building's then-deteriorating condition and spurred an 1844 restoration — but low-quality materials were used that haven't withstood the test of time.

The newspaper quotes a vietnamese political analyst who sums things up thusly: \"invasion is in their blood, and resistance is in our blood. \" while all that boat-ramming hasn't changed the fact that the oil platform is still in place, the wall street journal reports that beijing would be making a mistake if it thinks vietnam will let the issue quietly go away.

Here are some of the topics up for discussion, the significance of the gathering and the players. — hot topics: china's growing assertiveness in the south china sea is expected to top the agenda, with a standoff between chinese and vietnamese ships near the paracel islands putting a fresh spotlight on long-standing, bitter maritime disputes. There are conflicting territorial claims over the waters, which hold tremendous strategic importance as one of the world's biggest shipping lanes. They are also rich with fish, and huge oil and gas reserves are believed to lie beneath the seabed. Though the stakes are high, foreign ministers who gathered saturday ahead of the summit went no further than issuing a statement expressing concern and urging restraint by all parties.

Last week, it crawled through the south china sea, pulled by heavy-duty tugs, and parked in one of the most sensitive spots possible, about 17 miles off a speck of an island claimed by both china and vietnam. The vietnamese, at times embraced in brotherly communist party fealty by china, were taken by surprise.

            "Naypyidaw, myanmar ( ap ) — myanmar hopes its first-ever hosting of a summit of southeast asian leaders on sunday will help showcase progress made since the country emerged from a half-century of military rule. Here are some of the topics up for discussion, the significance of the gathering and the players. — hot topics: china's growing assertiveness in the south china sea is expected to top the agenda, with a standoff between chinese and vietnamese ships near the paracel islands putting a fresh spotlight on long-standing, bitter maritime disputes. There are conflicting territorial claims over the waters, which hold tremendous strategic importance as one of the world's biggest shipping lanes. They are also rich with fish, and huge oil and gas reserves are believed to lie beneath the seabed. Though the stakes are high, foreign ministers who gathered saturday ahead of the summit went no further than issuing a statement expressing concern and urging restraint by all parties. Tensions on the korean peninsula and thailand's political crisis also expected to be on the table. — the host: this is the first time myanmar is hosting a summit of southeast asian heads of",
            "Beijing — it is the pride of china's state-run oil industry and the nation's first deepwater drilling rig, a vessel as big as a football field and as tall as a 40-story building, with a $ 1 billion price tag. Last week, it crawled through the south china sea, pulled by heavy-duty tugs, and parked in one of the most sensitive spots possible, about 17 miles off a speck of an island claimed by both china and vietnam. The vietnamese, at times embraced in brotherly communist party fealty by china, were taken by surprise.

        "summary": "Minneapolis cops are seeking three white male suspects after a monday night shooting that injured five near a \" black lives matter \" protest outside the fourth precinct police station, reports the minneapolis star tribune. Per black lives matter rep miski noor, \" a group of white supremacists showed up at the protest, as they have done most nights. \" the new york times cites witness reports that the suspects — some say two white men and one asian man — were masked; bystanders claim the trio was wearing bulletproof vests, and noor says one man was \" shouting the n-word, \" per the new york daily news. She notes the group \" opened fire on about six protesters \" after they tried to move the group away. The suspects fled, and a police rep says the five victims were taken to local hospitals for non-life-threatening injuries. \" i am obviously appalled that white supremacists would open fire on nonviolent, peaceful protesters, \" the minneapolis naacp president tells the star tribune. The protesters have camped out in front of the police station since the fatal shooting of 24-year-old jamar clark earlier this month, the star tribune notes. But while the interloping group reportedly made previous appearances, a community activist describes the scene as becoming \" really chaotic, really fast \" and notes that when he heard what sounded like firecrackers, he thought, \" surely they're not shooting human beings. \" the minneapolis chapter of black lives matter has renounced the shootings as \" white supremacist terrorism, \" per the daily news. Meanwhile, in a statement issued through rep. Keith ellison's office, clark's brother thanked those who've supported his family, but notes that \" in light of [ the ] shootings, the family feels out of imminent concern for the safety of the occupiers, we must get the occupation of the 4th precinct ended and onto the next step, \" the ap reports.

        "summary": "Donald trump says he has gone where no gop presidential nominee has gone before with promises of paid maternity leave and federal subsidies for child care. Accompanied by his daughter, ivanka, trump unveiled his plan in a speech outside philadelphia on tuesday evening, the wall street journal reports. His campaign says the estimated $ 2.5 billion cost of providing six weeks of paid maternity leave through unemployment benefits will be covered by reducing waste elsewhere in the program. He promised to make child care tax-deductible for couples making less than $ 500,000, and give \" spending rebates \" of up to $ 1,200 to lower-income families. A roundup of coverage: npr takes a close look at the plan — which also includes special savings accounts for caring for children and elderly relatives — and at how the trump campaign says it will pay for it. The funding plan involves \" comprehensive tax and economic reform, \" according to a campaign spokesman. The washington post notes that trump's paid maternity leave looks a lot like the \" baby ui \" plan that bill clinton supported in 1999, which the bush administration rolled back in 2003. Fiscal conservatives aren't happy about what they see as an expansion of government spending, though the new york times reports that social conservatives are pleased that trump's plan includes tax credits for stay-at-home moms. \" my opponent has no child care plan, \" trump said. Politico, however, notes that hillary clinton's plan includes 12 weeks of paid maternity leave, to be paid for by raising taxes on the rich.",

        "summary": "With the first presidential debate just days away, mitt romney is taking aim at the deficit, an issue even more important than job creation to independent voters, according to a wall street journal poll. He told voters at a rally in ohio yesterday that despite his tax-cutting plans, they shouldn't \" be expecting a huge cut in taxes because i ' m also going to lower deductions and exemptions. \" romney plans to cut all income tax rates by 20 % and lower the corporate tax rate to to 25 % from 35 %, but his staffers describe the plan as a tax reform, not a tax cut, and argue that it will not significantly increase the deficit. President obama, meanwhile, is pushing \" economic patriotism \" ahead of the debate, the ap reports. In a new ad airing in seven battleground states, the president outlines an economic plan he says will create a million new manufacturing jobs. Some conservative mormons are doing their own debate preparation, according to an email obtained by buzzfeed. The email — not officially sanctioned by the church — is circulating in at least four states and urges mormons to fast and pray for romney for 24 hours to ensure he will be blessed in the debates, which start wednesday. In the debates, romney needs to be assertive and \" draw a sharp contrast between a romney recovery and obama stagnation, \" newt gingrich tells politico. \" if he is as assertive and direct with obama as he was with me in the two florida debates, he ' ll be fine, \" gingrich says. \" he's got to go in there, not be hostile but be assertive, clear, and direct, and not back off. \"",

The independent reports david nutt — who was fired by the british government after claiming horse riding was more dangerous than ecstasy — developed about 90 compounds of something he's calling \" alcosynth \" and is testing out two for wide-scale alcohol replacement, which he says will happen by 2050. \" they ' ll dispense the alcosynth into your cocktail and then you ' ll have the pleasure without damaging your liver and your heart, \" nutt says.

        "summary": "A new study suggests a relatively easy way to gauge whether people are more likely to wind up with an alzheimer's diagnosis as far as 18 years down the road: memory and thinking tests. A study out of the rush university medical center in chicago tracked more than 2,000 people with an average age of 73 who did not have an alzheimer's diagnosis when the study began, explains healthday news. They took mental skills tests every three years over a nearly two-decade span, and it turns out that those who scored low on the tests had a greater chance of being diagnosed with alzheimer's. At the time they took the tests, though, they showed no obvious symptoms of looming trouble, save for those low test scores. What's more, the eventual alzheimer's patients showed progressively worse results in the testing. \" the changes in thinking and memory that precede obvious symptoms of alzheimer's disease begin decades before, \" says kumar rajan, author of the study in neurology. He says the findings should be interpreted generally — that low test scores shouldn't be used to predict an individual's risk. But such tests might someday become a routine part of health maintenance for those in middle age, notes time. For those who fare poorly, it might be wise to try to take preventative efforts. Rajan plans to next study what some of those efforts might be, perhaps even simple things such as crossword puzzles or increased social interaction. ( in the meantime, those who snore might be at greater risk, too. )",

        "summary": "Scientists have long been baffled by a lack of triassic period fossils from large, herbivorous dinosaurs known as sauropods near the equator. A new study offers some illumination: it suggests a hot, unpredictable climate and high carbon dioxide levels kept some of the world's first dinosaurs away — and may shed light on our own issues with climate change. Researchers first analyzed ancient sedimentary rocks in new mexico, which would have been much closer to the equator as part of the supercontinent pangea some 215 million years ago, reports livescience. In separating carbon isotopes from fossilized organic matter, they identified significant and rapid changes to the ecosystem and atmospheric co2 levels — which were four to six times those of today. Pollen and spores suggested available plants varied in quantity based on the frequent changes, while fossil charcoal showed evidence of wildfires every few dozen years that wreaked havoc on vegetation. The combined factors suggest an environment too unstable for sauropods until about 30 million years later, though small, carnivorous dinosaurs did populate the area. \" the conditions would have been something similar to the arid western united states today, although there would have been trees and smaller plants near streams and rivers and forests during humid times, \" study author jessica whiteside explains in a press release. Eerily, she writes at the conversation that \" rapid climate swings and extremes of drought and intense heat driven by increasing atmospheric co2 levels have as much ability to alter the vegetation supporting modern human populations as they did for the large plant-eating dinosaurs in the triassic. \" whiteside adds we can expect \" profound challenges to human sustainability in the future if we experience the high co2 conditions predicted to develop in the coming 100 to 200 years. \" ( scientists made an incredible discovery inside \" crap \" dino fossils. )",

That's because the bill doesn't touch the debt ceiling and kicks the sequester can down the road. What you ' ll need to brace yourself for: the debt ceiling: another crisis isn't too far off — late february or early march. That's when the government, which hit the $ 16.394 trillion debt ceiling yesterday, will have finished eating through the roughly $ 200 billion of extra borrowing the treasury department has readied via \" extraordinary measures. \" cnnmoney reminds us what happened last time around: s&p downgraded our credit rating, the stock market shuddered, and we wasted $ 1.3 billion in taxpayer dollars. Sequester: the bill that's now in the house's hands would kick the can down the road on $ 110 billion in automatic cuts to the budgets of the pentagon and many domestic agencies. Next deadline? two months. The budget: the government is supposed to enact a new budget when the fiscal year begins, on oct. 1. But it's been years since that timeline has been met, with congress instead relying on \" continuing resolutions, \" described by cnnmoney as a \" fancy way of saying ' band-aid solution. ' \" the expiration date of the current \" band-aid \" is march 27. And if we make it through those, we're still not done: quartz writes that two more issues will pop up a year from now, per the new bill. The so-called \" doctor cliff, \" the 27 % cut in medicare payments to doctors, has been delayed a year. Jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed were extended for a year, and quartz expects \" america will still have a large cohort of long-term unemployed when the current extension expires. \"",

Politico notes that his dominance extended to evangelicals, who chose him over ted cruz 57 % to 30 % in pennsylvania. With 118 bound delegates at stake, trump won at least 105 — putting him around three-quarters of the way to the necessary 1,237 — with five going to john kasich and one to ted cruz. His haul includes all 17 bound delegates in pennsylvania, though the state's 54 unbound delegates could complicate his path to the nomination, the hill reports. In his victory speech, trump attacked hillary clinton instead of his gop rivals, calling her \" crooked \" and saying the \" only card she has is the woman's card. \" \" if hillary clinton were a man, i don't think she'd get 5 % of the vote, \" he said.

The proposal would reportedly raise about $ 44 million a year ( as a flat surcharge, rather than a per-text fee ), and it would be retroactive for five years.

From there, over $ 1 million of it went to east asia and back to appear legitimate — an international route that made it harder for the rcmp to trace. But trace it they did. According to court documents, most of the money returned to canada as a loan to vancouver-based hoi fu enterprises ltd. The loan came from a chinese company that, via intermediaries, bought canadian dollars from a supposed hong kong company that had received the montreal money. And presto, hoi fu received about $ 764,000 in loans to help pay a big new mortgage. Luckily, macewan recovered over 92 % of lost funds, in part by suing hoi fu and seizing money from the bank. The school also set up anti-phishing measures to avoid getting fooled again. \" we knew we were at fault... And we accept that, \" a school rep tells the cbc. No arrests have been reported in the case. ( in another story, the so-called \" affluenza \" mom has been charged with money laundering. )",

Help would soon arrive, he thought. But what the pair ended up going through in the ocean soon brought his fears to the forefront, notes the guardian, with a 21-hour ordeal that included mcmahon's life vest getting punctured ( meaning he had to tread water and swim ), jellyfish stings, and being circled by a shark as rescue choppers and search planes passed them by, unable to see them due to the waves and sun glare even though they flew over the two at least 10 times. And it was a long, cold night in the water for the pair, who barely knew each other before their flight. They each credit the other with their survival — uemoto says mcmahon kept her calm, while mcmahon says it was uemoto who encouraged him to keep going when, in the middle of the night, he was freezing, plagued by cramps, and ready to give up. \" just hang on to my ankles, \" she told him, which he did while she kept them both afloat for more than an hour. The next morning, a new round of rescuers flew overhead, and this time a us coast guard helicopter spotted them. \" it wasn't our time, \" mcmahon now says. \" we just both knew we were going to go back and just be a family. \" both tell khon2 — which notes they were treated for minor injuries, as well as hypothermia and dehydration — that they plan to keep piloting for mokulele airlines.",

They ' ll have to consider which members could survive the political liability that comes with making hard decisions ahead of the 2012 elections. They ' ll also have to decide whether to choose members that are typically loyal to party ideology or are more interested in compromise. Once the group is selected, they have until thanksgiving to draft a plan to create $ 1.2 trillion in savings. Seven of the 12 members would have to approve the plan to send it to congress. The full congress can then either approve the plan or allow across-the-board cuts to security and entitlement programs to kick in. Cbsnews.com special report: america's debt battle sen. Ben nelson, d-neb., one of the senators who voted against the debt limit package tuesday, said this morning he wouldn't serve on the super committee if asked, the hill reports. \" they're not going to [ ask ], and if i voted for it and they asked me to, i still wouldn't serve on it, \" nelson said on the nebraska radio show klin news talk. The senator predicted the committee will get hung up in partisan gridlock and suggested that creating such a committee was the wrong approach to policy making. \" i don't think we can take politics out of every difficult decision, \" he said. \" i don't like to cede away or give away my responsibility, and certainly i don't like to authorize a group of my colleagues to do what i was sent to washington to do. \" two other senators, republican sen. Saxby chambliss of georgia and democratic sen. Mark warner of virginia, expressed their skepticism about the new super committee on tuesday"

Chuck schumer as saying. The legislation, which was passed by a 98-2 vote, seeks to punish russia for its meddling in the us election and actions in ukraine and syria. Nbc news reports the sanctions target russian individuals who give weapons to the assad regime, violate human rights, or are involved in the defense and intelligence industries. They also target russia's shipping, mining, and railway industries. If the legislation passes the house, it would head to trump for signing. The white house hasn't weighed in on the legislation but says it's \" committed \" to the existing russian sanctions. The trump administration had considered lifting russian sanctions in the past, and secretary of state rex tillerson opposed the new legislation, worrying it could hurt the us ' ability to have a \" constructive dialogue \" with russia. Regardless, gop senators believe trump would sign it, with sen. Bob corker saying: \" look, this bill is going to become law. \" the two dissenting votes were sen. Rand paul and sen. Bernie sanders.

        "summary": "A man in custody in colorado has confessed to fatally shooting 19-year-old natalie bollinger, but he claims her death was still suicide, according to arrest documents seen by nbc news. According to an arrest affidavit, joseph michael lopez, 22, told investigators that he shot the teen after answering a craigslist ad in the \" women seeking men \" section titled: \" i want to put a hit on myself. \" he claimed he answered the ad because he had suffered from depression and thought he could help the teen, but he ended up shooting her after he couldn't talk her out of the \" suicide. \" lopez, who's being held on suspicion of first-degree murder, said he prayed with bollinger before shooting her with a 9mm gun that she'd given him. He said she told him he could keep the gun as payment. Bollinger's body was found dec. 29 in a wooded area in adams county, east of boulder. The previous day, her boyfriend told police that she was missing and his glock 9mm pistol was gone, the ap reports. According to an autopsy, she had a \" potentially lethal \" level of heroin in her system when she was killed. Days earlier, she had sought a protection order against a man she said had been stalking her, people reports. Investigators connected lopez to the case through more than 100 text messages exchanged on the night she died. Police haven't confirmed whether the ad seeking a hit man was actually placed. Friends and relatives say bollinger had suicidal thoughts in the past, but some say she'd been happy recently and had applied for a job the day before she died. ( this man's teen wife was murdered in front of him — at his request. )",

Though the film \" may not accomplish everything it sets out to do, \" monica castillo appreciated that it embraced trauma and survivor's guilt as an \" explicit subject \" as opposed to ignoring such real-life struggles. Aiding this story line, curtis delivers a \" moving \" performance, her character's instability \" palpable, \" castillo writes at npr. Rex reed was not impressed.
