Claire foy, who won a golden globe and two screen actor guild awards for best actress for her portrayal of queen elizabeth ii in the first two seasons of the netflix show, was paid less than male co-star matt smith, who played husband prince phillip, executive producers revealed tuesday, per usa today. Foy, 33, whose only major acting credit prior to the crown was a role in bbc mini series wolf hall, pulled in $ 40,000 per episode, according to variety. Smith, 35, who rose to fame on the bbc's doctor who, received more ( the amount hasn't been disclosed ) because he was seen as a more established actor, reports the new york times. However, show runners say the issue will be rectified as the crown moves into its third season with an entirely new cast, with 44-year-old olivia colman taking over for foy. \" going forward, no one gets paid more than the queen, \" says suzanne mackie, creative director of left bank pictures, which produces the crown. Usa today notes netflix only purchased rights to air the crown and wasn't involved in salary decisions. ( michelle williams might have some advice for foy. )",

Just ask robert de niro, or david letterman, or katy perry. Stars with brand names are more in demand than ever as dozens of competing outlets search for anything that will help a show stand out from the pack. The new business models that govern streaming services have also had the effect of raising upfront payments to top talent because traditional forms of generating a profit from a hit series — through international sales and off-network syndication — are no longer an option.

All three major nyc-area airports saw flights falling behind schedule yesterday and, as the washington post puts it, air traffic controllers \" never caught up, \" with delays clocking in at between one and three hours. Backups at those three airports have the unfortunate tendency to reverberate, and delays started hitting miami, los angeles, and charlotte in the latter part of the day. Why? air traffic controllers — 1,500 of them — went on furlough; tsa and customs furloughs also caused backups at some airports. About 10 % of all air traffic controllers will be off each day until october, and the faa predicts one-third of passengers will experience delays during that time. Here's some really awful context: airlines for america reports that the faa estimates delays could hit 6,700 flights a day; last year's worst travel day saw 3,000 flights delayed due to weather.",

The problem, explains vice news, is that the only way for dispensaries to legally get pot for the next 18 months is via wholesale liquor distributors, who secured the exclusive right via a november ballot measure. But of the seven liquor distributors to have applied for a license to restock dispensaries, zero have \" met the application requirements. \" that's where the statement of emergency, signed friday by gov.

It says the emergency regulation is needed to allow the department of taxation to figure out whether limiting licenses to liquor dealers will result in an insufficient number of pot distributors in the state. This is a real concern, because without pot sales, \" the state will not realize the revenue on which the state budget relies. \" indeed, the las vegas sun reports the first four days of sales brought in $ 500,000 in tax revenue, with the six-month tax estimate set at $ 30 million. The whole thing has been a bit of a saga: in mid-june, liquor distributors won a preliminary injunction banning the state from handing out licenses to other entities, reason notes. As for how pot sales have happened to date, dispensaries were able to stock up pre-july 1. But \" some establishments report the need for delivery within the next several days, \" a rep for the department said in an email to the reno gazette-journal friday.",

Pink custom glasses were ordered. \" a week later we picked up the glasses and she tried them on for a quick second in the office to make sure they fitted properly, \" sinclair tells local 12. \" then we decided to go out to eat... And then this was her reaction of her first time being able to see our faces. \" \" her reaction: ) melts my heart, \" reads part of the caption to the video, which sinclair posted to facebook june 6. That reaction starts with a bit of squirming as the glasses go on, but then piper breaks out into some serious grins as she stares at her mom. Dad then calls her name and she turns her head, seemingly spots him, and turns her head side to side, beaming again. Sinclair says she was \" choking back tears of joy \" as she watched, and she's been similarly \" blown away \" by the reaction to the video, which she hopes will help generate awareness about infant eye health. As for how piper is doing, she's crawling and is getting better at wearing her glasses — though she likes to chew on them.

Based on testimonials from parents, orrin devinsky of nyu's comprehensive epilepsy center set out to find proof that epilepsy could be treated with cannabidiol ( cbd ) — and he says he did. In a 14-week study, 60 kids and teens with a severe form of epilepsy known as dravet syndrome were given doses of cbd and saw their number of monthly convulsive seizures fall from 12 on average to about six, reports live science. Three patients saw their seizures stop entirely, the researchers say in the new england journal of medicine. One downside: almost all patients who took cbd reported side effects, including vomiting and diarrhea, per scientific american. ( cbd doesn't get users high. ) but 62 % of caregivers said the condition of the child in their care improved overall. That's compared to 34 % of caregivers of children who took a placebo, who went from having about 15 monthly seizures to about 14. Given this study and others, devinsky says it's \" medieval \" that marijuana is deemed a schedule i substance under the controlled substances act. Drugs in this category have \" no currently accepted medical use, \" according to the drug enforcement administration, but that's \" simply untrue, \" he says. \" to put cbd as a schedule i drug violates scientific data and common sense. \" ( more on cbd and epilepsy here. )",

        "summary": "One doesn't usually think of a cookbook as \" lavish and erotic, \" but that's how the guardian is describing a reissue by taschen of a famous cookbook first published in 1973. Described by food and wine as \" more hieronymus bosch than anthony bourdain, \" salvador dali's les diners de gala is a 12-chapter compendium of the artist's surreal imagery, as well as 136 often-unconventional recipes, some culled from paris'top restaurants at the time, notes kottke. And by \" unconventional, \" we mean such concoctions as conger eel of the rising sun and frog pasties ( the guardian features a recipe for the latter ), in chapters with titles like \" deoxyribonucleic atavism, \" aka the veggie section. The art is similarly bizarre, including ( and it's easiest to quote the guardian ) a \" desert scene in which a telephone receiver is suspended on a twig over a melting plate holding two fried eggs and a razor blade. \" dali, who died in 1989, and his wife, gala, were known for throwing sumptuous dinner parties — konbini notes food would be brought in on gold platters to costumed guests — and the original edition of the cookbook is a collector's item, with only about 400 copies said to remain. Readers will also get a taste for edibles that were among dali's favorites and those he found unforgivable, including spinach, which he describes as \" that detestable, degrading vegetable. \" per the cookbook's description on amazon, where it's now available for preorder, dali issues just one warning in the book's intro: \" if you are a disciple of one of those calorie-counters who turn the joys of eating into a form of punishment, close this book at once; it is too lively, too aggressive, and far too impertinent for you. \" ( on the other end of the spectrum: a recipe book by ibm's supercomputer chef. )",

Officials want people to come forward if they have information. \"there are indications at the crime scene that this was not a random act, \" tedesco said at a news conference wednesday afternoon. \"we are certainly appealing to people in the community that would have any knowledge as to what may have transpired there to contact us as soon as possible. \" the chief did not release the names of the victims, as additional family members are still being contacted, nor did he comment on whether any weapons were found or if there had been a forced entry.

        "summary": "Libyan protesters are fighting to keep control of the areas they've taken as they increasingly clash with pro-gadhafi forces. The latest: the two sides are fighting over a key oil installation and airstrip, the ap reports. They are located on the coast of eastern libya, most of which is held by the rebels, but today gadhafi supporters took back the oil facility as the rebels continued to fight. In the same area, pro-gadhafi forces also retook control of a port and bombed an ammunition depot controlled by the rebels. The bombing is one of many airstrikes launched by libyan forces against the rebels, all of which reportedly target only weapons facilities. But some air force pilots have refused to fly after they claim they were ordered to bomb civilians. Loyalists yesterday were able to push rebels back from some of the western towns near tripoli, but protesters managed to hold onto zawiyah, the city closest to the capital. Gadhafi's forces were able to reclaim control of two other towns near tripoli and threaten a third, but rebels held on to three other areas near the capital. Two us warships entered the suez canal this morning en route to the mediterranean, the ap adds. Defense secretary robert gates ordered the uss kearsarge, which has 42 helicopters on board, and the uss ponce to move closer to the libyan coast. Even so, gates downplayed the possibility of america's military intervening, noting that it's not a good time for the us to enter into another middle east war, the new york times reports. He and adm. Mike mullen distanced themselves from comments by hillary clinton that a no-fly zone was an \" active consideration. \" a bbc un correspondent says other leaders also appear to be reluctant to impose a no-fly zone over libya.

Researchers say that by 2050, the arctic ice sheet will be weak enough for cargo ships to take the northern route between the atlantic and pacific oceans without the aid of icebreakers, the guardian reports. Ships with just moderate ice protection will be able to sail directly over the north pole, making it a lot faster and cheaper to ship goods from china to europe. Scientists, who studied seven different climate models, say it's too late to cut carbon emissions enough to prevent the change, the telegraph reports. As big business spies new arctic opportunities, environmentalists are campaigning to create a sanctuary in the region. The arctic \" is melting because of our use of dirty fossil fuel energy, and in the near future it could be ice-free for the first time since humans walked the earth, \" greenpeace's save the arctic petition states. \" this would be not only devastating for the people, polar bears, narwhals, walruses, and other species that live there — but for the rest of us too, \" because the region's ice helps cool down the world by reflecting sunlight.",

            "Ships should be able to sail directly over the north pole by the middle of this century, considerably reducing the costs of trade between europe and china but posing new economic, strategic and environmental challenges for governments, according to scientists. The dramatic reduction in the thickness and extent of late summer sea ice that has taken place in each of the last seven years has already made it possible for some ice-strengthened ships to travel across the north of russia via the \" northern sea route \". Last year a total of 46 ships made the trans-arctic passage, mostly escorted at considerable cost by russian icebreakers. But by 2050, say laurence c. Smith and scott r. Stephenson at the university of california in the journal pnas on monday, ordinary vessels should be able to travel easily along the northern sea route, and moderately ice-strengthened ships should be able to take the shortest possible route between the pacific and atlantic oceans, passing over the pole itself.

            "Ships should be able to sail directly over the north pole by the middle of this century, considerably reducing the costs of trade between europe and china but posing new economic, strategic and environmental challenges for governments, according to scientists. The dramatic reduction in the thickness and extent of late summer sea ice that has taken place in each of the last seven years has already made it possible for some ice-strengthened ships to travel across the north of russia via the \" northern sea route \". Last year a total of 46 ships made the trans-arctic passage, mostly escorted at considerable cost by russian icebreakers. But by 2050, say laurence c. Smith and scott r. Stephenson at the university of california in the journal pnas on monday, ordinary vessels should be able to travel easily along the northern sea route, and moderately ice-strengthened ships should be able to take the shortest possible route between the pacific and atlantic oceans, passing over the pole itself.

In the washington post, dana milbank agrees that cruz is all about ambition — but he says republicans like cruz aren't risking their necks in the shutdown debate. In fact, they're \" doing what's necessary to survive in a political system gone mad. \" thanks in large part to district mapping, few gop house seats are \" even marginally competitive, \" and conservative-dominated primaries are the only threat.

Reporter michael barbaro tweeted that the accusation was \" factually inaccurate, \" and that women named by trump's office were among the dozens of women interviewed for the piece. In other trump news: in yet another tweet, trump said a washington post story about potential vp candidates was wrong. He said most of the candidates named were not being considered. President obama didn't name trump in his commencement address at rutgers university on sunday, but it was obvious whom he was talking about with his denunciations of \" anti-intellectualism, \" wall-building, and misplaced nostalgia for the \" good old days, \" the washington post reports. Obama also warned that \" ignorance is not a virtue. \" \" it's not cool to not know what you are talking about, \" he said. \" that's not keeping it real or telling it like it is. That's not challenging political correctness. That's just not knowing what you are talking about. \" reuters reports that in an interview that aired on monday in britain, trump said he probably wouldn't have a good relationship with prime minister david cameron, who called his remarks on muslims last year \" divisive, stupid, and wrong. \" \" i hope to have a good relationship with him, but it sounds like he's not willing to address the problem either, \" said trump.

        "summary": "When you're hacking up a lung and it's not getting better, you know you're going to have to visit the doctor. What you ( and even the doctor ) often don't know is whether that antibiotic rx you may get is going to work, simply because it's often hard to tell the difference between a viral and bacterial infection. But a study published in plos one says that may all change with a blood test that can quickly differentiate between the two, the bbc reports. And if memed's immunoxpert proves to work as scientists say it does, it could not only get antibiotics more quickly to patients with bacterial infections ( the only ones antibiotics work on ), but also cut down on patients who don't have bacterial infections from taking them. That's big, because overuse is linked to widespread antibiotic resistance. The study in israel examined some 1,000 patients, scrutinizing the body's immune response to the sickness and honing in on protein trails that are activated depending on whether an infection is viral or bacterial. In particular, levels in blood of one protein called trail significantly shot up in subjects who had been infected with viruses, while it dropped in patients with bacterial illnesses. The ceo of memed says the test works — a post at eurekalert touts \" highly accurate results, with sensitivity and specificity greater than 90 % \" — and offers results within two hours for most patients, per the bbc. \" it is not perfect and it does not replace a physician's judgment, but it is better than many of the routine tests used in practice today, \" eran eden says.

Contrary to studies suggesting drinking in moderation might actually be good for you, the latest in the british medical journal determined that middle-aged moderate drinkers who consumed between eight to 12 shots, bottles of beer, or small glasses of wine per week were more likely than light or non-drinkers to suffer a decline in language ability over a 30-year period, reports usa today. Perhaps most concerning, moderate drinkers were also three times more likely than non-drinkers to experience a shrinking of the hippocampus, which is responsible for memory. In the study of 527 brits, mostly middle-class men, researchers found that 35 % of non-drinkers had experienced hippocampal atrophy after 30 years, compared to 65 % of moderate drinkers and 77 % of participants who drank the most, reports the guardian. As hippocampal atrophy may be linked to dementia, moderate drinking, then, could be tied to future memory loss, reports cnn. Researchers, who expected light to moderate drinkers to be protected from cognitive decline, were \" surprised, \" co-author anya topiwala explains. \" these are people who are drinking at levels that many consider social drinkers, so they are not consuming a lot. \" while researchers took age, sex, social activity, and education into account, experts caution that other factors, like diet, may play a role.

Irving rothman says he's amassed several clues, one being that swift, an anglican minister, studied hebrew at trinity college before going on to publish his iconic book in 1726, reports the houston chronicle. The book chronicles the travels of lemuel gulliver, who at one point is captured by 6-inch-tall people on the island lilliput. Here gulliver encounters a \" nonsense \" language built off of 22 letters, just like hebrew. And one phrase, \" borach mivola, \" shouted while gulliver imbibes liquor, could be a variant of the hebrew \" baruch, \" or \" blessed, \" with \" mivola \" being related to the hebrew \" mivolim, \" or \" complete defeat. \" and the \" gnea yahoo, \" swift's term for irrational, wild creatures, could be built off a hebrew variant of god — yahveh — where \" gnea, \" if read right to left, as hebrew is, sounds like \" ayn, \" or \" not. \" \" those beasts are the opposite of god, \" rothman concludes, while \" gulliver is a human being achieving saving grace, a hope not accorded to the yahoo. \" ( how old is the old testament really? )",

The former vp takes particular issue with trump's response to the violence in charlottesville, declaring that the president \" proclaimed a moral equivalency between neo-nazis and klansmen and those who would oppose their venom and hate \" and \" emboldened white supremacists with messages of comfort and support. \" biden also mentions trump's pardon of former sheriff joe arpaio and concludes that trump's \" contempt for the u.s.

I called 58 facets and they charged about half what others charged for a battery replacement, so this was a no-brainer pick as they've got excellent reviews to top it off. When i walked in the store, rick asked if i wanted a cup of tea. It caught me off guard and i thought he was being sarcastic. I was about to request a cappuccino. Fortunately i was able to keep my occasional douchebag tendency in check and politely declined. Rick changed the batteries out while we chatted with karen about all the businesses that have come and gone over the years here on main st. These folks are really nice, and i felt like an asshole for using their yelp deal to pay for their already ridiculously cheap battery replacement charge.

Path's limit is in keeping with the work of evolutionary anthropologist robin dunbar, who famously theorized that you can only maintain close relationships with 150 people — and of those, you probably only trust 50 of them, npr notes. Developed by a former facebook exec and a napster co-founder, the photo-centric service's founders believe that facebook users aren't divulging everything to their 5,000 friends, and will share more if their number of connections is limited — though they're not pitching it as a facebook replacement, but as something meant to \" ride alongside \" other networks. It launches as an iphone app that allows users to find friends using email addresses or phone numbers, then snap, post, and tag photos to create a \" path \" of your life, the los angeles times reports.",

The attempted suicide charge stems from a 2006 arrest at a new delhi protest and subsequent hospitalization.

Having heard a farmer's story about moles digging up bits of pottery on the land, the amateur archaeologist tells the guardian he had a hunch that something important lay beneath, and when the parcel went on the market in 2004, he bought it. Now, it looks like his bet is paying off: he believes his land is sitting atop the lost city of trellech — wales ' largest city in the 13th century, reports the bbc — and the guardian reports his theory is starting to gain traction. Wilson, a former toll collector who got his undergrad degree in archaeology, estimates the project has cost more than $ 200,000, funded in part through donations ( you can be an archaeologist for a day for $ 61 ). With help from some 1,000 volunteers, wilson says he has so far discovered eight buildings, and he intends to spend 2017 working on the remains of what he believes is a manor house surrounded by a moat. In 2006, he told archaeology.org that excavating the field \" will probably take about 50 years, so basically the rest of my life. \" as for the history of the site, it was founded by the de clare family in the 1200s as a hub that produced iron weapons and armor, and its population exploded. Per wilson, in just 25 years it grew to 10,000 people — a quarter of london's size, though wilson points out it took london 250 years to amass its 40,000 people. The bbc reports the de clares'settlement is thought to have been destroyed in 1296. ( read about the seven biggest archaeology finds of 2016. )",

Over the past 15 years he and a hardy band of volunteers have painstakingly unearthed what they believe are the remains of a sprawling medieval city",
            "Conversations: field of dreams volume 59 number 5, september/october 2006 an enthusiast was so convinced that a farmer's plot hid a medieval city, he bought it. Stuart wilson made headlines when excavations made a convincing case for the identification of the \" lost \" city of trellech, a large medieval welsh city that professional archaeologists had been seeking for decades. But what was as newsmaking as the discovery was how the 27-year-old former toll collector, who holds an undergraduate degree in archaeology from york university, made it. Archaeology talked to wilson, an active member of his local archaeology society, about taking big risks and staking independent claims. ( courtesy stuart wilson"

Well, the guardian and washington post have obtained top-secret documents submitted to and approved by that court that outline the rules and limits placed on the program. How reassuring they are may depend on your level of skepticism. The glass half private reading: the documents outline many steps the nsa must take to be sure its would-be target is a foreigner, including reviewing all available data on the target and checking him against a huge database of phone numbers and email addresses known to belong to americans to make sure he is a non-united states person. If the target enters the us, surveillance is halted immediately, even if the target is not a us citizen. The glass half spied on reading: the nsa doesn't check each target with the court or anyone else; it gets broad authority to spy on anyone it feels meets its criteria, and if it has no data on a target's location, it can assume the target is overseas. It can retain any \" inadvertently acquired \" domestic communications that contain intelligence or info on criminal activity, and it can keep data that could involve us persons for up to five years. The court issues broad, bulk warrants; one seen by the guardian was only a paragraph long and unburdened by legal rationale. And any foreigner is fair game to be targeted, whether suspected of wrongdoing or not. The guardian also points out that these rules only apply to the chunk of nsa activities authorized by the foreign intelligence surveillance act. The bulk seizing of call records occurs under the patriot act. Civil liberties groups are among those not calmed by the disclosures. \" what's most striking about the targeting procedures is the discretion they confer on the nsa, \" says a brennan center for justice exec.

        "summary": "Seniors who indulge in a morning lie-in may want to take note. A new study found that older adults who slept more than nine hours a night were at double the risk of developing alzheimer's and other neurological disorders, the new york times reports. The red flag was limited to those who increased their sleeping time with age. But for those sleep-lovers who have always enjoyed lazy mornings curled under the covers, there was no increased risk. Senior author dr. Sudha seshadri of boston university says the change in sleep patterns is likely a symptom rather than a cause of dementia. \" we're not suggesting you go wake up grandpa, \" he tells the times. In the study, researchers tracked 2,457 people over 60, average age 72, for 10 years. They write in the journal neurology that those who began sleeping longer than nine hours had smaller brain volumes, took longer to process information, and showed signs of memory loss, reports the telegraph. Seshadri theorizes that sleeping was a \" compensatory mechanism \" as the body tries to rid itself of a toxic protein called beta amyloid. A buildup of this protein in the brain causes plaques in alzheimer's sufferers. About 7 % of people over age 65 develop some form of dementia, per the telegraph. While there is no cure, early intervention and meds can lead to treatments that can slow the onset. \" persons reporting long sleep time may warrant assessment and monitoring for problems with thinking and memory, \" says study researcher dr. Matthew pase. ( heartburn meds have been linked to a higher risk of dementia. )",

It's a twisted tale: prosecutors say the man who pulled the trigger — alfred everette, convicted of murder in 2014 — was promised a cut of the insurance money from raine and her future third husband, james raine, before james ' own murder in mississippi in 2011. Police say emma raine is also a suspect in that case, though no charges have been laid. Raine has pleaded not guilty in smith's death and faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted. The trial could begin as soon as wednesday. Police allege raine hired everette, james raine's adoptive brother, to shoot smith, 38, outside his new orleans home. Police say his wife was likely inside and witnessed the shooting, but called a friend instead of 911, per the inquisitr. James raine was similarly shot inside his home in 2011 while his wife was apparently out of town. During everette's trial, prosecutors also described the death of raine's first husband, leroy evans, in 1994 as suspicious.

Authorities say that the pastor's wife, emma raines, agreed to pay everette $ 100,000 for the hit. The case is like something out of a movie. Pastor ernest smith's death is one of three dead men who were connected to emma raines. Raines has not been convicted in any of the deaths as of now. The prosecution asserts that emma raines hired hitman terry everette to murder smith outside his home in new orleans back in 2006. Court records show that everett waited for the clergyman to arrive at his home at 11: 30 p.m. As the victim tried to walk toward his front door, everette got out of his vehicle and shot the man in the torso two times. The fallen pastor tried to make it inside his house, where emma raines was waiting, but he dropped dead before he could reach help. Police say she most likely witnessed the man's shooting death and called",

Scientists say copper might be the culprit, per research published in the international journal of cosmetic science picked up by the telegraph. The dastardly process: copper found in pipes ( or in your hot water tank ) leaches into water; wash your hair with it, and over time the metal will build up in the strands ' outer layers, where it amplifies the creation of cuticle-destroying molecules. That translates into weaker hair, which makes it more susceptible to things like split ends and fly-aways. If you dye your hair, the effect is worse, they say. The \" they \" in this equation is noteworthy, though: they're researchers with procter and gamble, which just so happens to be working on creating copper-fighting hair dyes. They looked at hair samples from women living in various parts of the globe, and found that everyone seemed to have it in their hair, at varying levels. \" you often can't see the effects under the microscope, which is why we believe copper has been largely missed as a source of damage, \" says the head scientist at pantene. Quirky side note: the daily mail reports that a 2012 poll of 2,000 brits found women endure 26 years of bad hair in their lifetime.",

Even as he turns his attention to the search for alien life, hawking says we should think twice before making any efforts to communicate with alien civilizations, sciencealert reports. Any civilization advanced enough to contact earth is likely to be \" vastly more powerful [ than us ] and may not see us as any more valuable than we see bacteria, \" hawking says. He explains that an alien civilization arriving at earth could use its vast technological advantage to take advantage of our planet in the same way columbus exploited the native americans. Hawking made the comments in a new video, stephen hawking's favorite places, which can be viewed on curiositystream. One of hawking's current projects, breakthrough listen, is dedicated to scanning the nearest million stars for signs of alien life, the guardian reports. That project's first major target is kic 8462852, an irregular star that astronomers have theorized may be home to an alien \" megastructure. \" \" as i grow older i am more convinced than ever that we are not alone, \" hawkins says in the film. \" one day we might receive a signal from a planet...

As macabre as it was, police immediately suspected more graves remained hidden, given the unsolved disappearances of multiple women of similar backgrounds ( linked to drugs and prostitution ) between 2005 and 2006.

At least one body has been fully excavated. \" we certainly understand and are concerned this might be one of the six to eight missing women, \" albuquerque mayor tim keller tells koat. \" there's enough there to cause concern, \" adds police chief michael geier, noting the scene gave him the feeling of \" deja vu. \" the journal describes the similarities between the two sites as \" striking. \" still, authorities haven't found evidence linking the find to the west mesa murders.

Feed them, keep them warm, with no utility bills, \" the company's michael reynolds tells the guardian. By contrast, he adds, \"really, all government housing is junk. \" but what's an earthship? according to inhabitat, it's a \" low-cost home that strives for self-sufficiency... Built primarily with recycled materials. \" earthship biotecture has built earthships for people in need in several countries, such as haiti, india, and sierra leone. Now it is building one on canada's first nations reserve. According to the calgary herald, the reality for many reserve residents is overcrowded, sub-standard housing. Take francine doxtator, for instance. She lives in a leaky trailer, \" ravaged by mice and black mold, \" with her disabled daughter and five grandchildren. Soon, however, doxtator and her family will be the first first nations family to move into an earthship. \" i still don't believe it's happening, \" she tells the guardian. The $ 57,000 house, funded by earthship biotecture, contributions, and fundraising, will include solar panels, a cistern to collect rainwater, and hundreds of old tires that will \" create a dense thermomass \" for temperature regulation. Local volunteers will help build it. The hope is to eventually have a local team that can help others build earthships of their own. But, one of the volunteers tells the guardian, strict building codes may be a hurdle, as well raising the money to build an earthship in the first place. As excited as she is for her new digs, doxator does have one concern: \"i just hope it doesn't look like a flintstones house in the end. \"",

Albert woodfox has been in solitary confinement for 43 years, though he could be released from louisiana state penitentiary as early as friday. Since 1972, woodfox has spent 23 hours a day in a tiny cell that can be crossed in just four paces, the los angeles times reports, but how he ' ll cope on the outside isn't clear. In a piece last year, time reported prisoners in long-term isolation are subject to panic attacks, paranoia, disordered thinking, anger, and compulsive actions, like incessant pacing or cleaning, while their basic cognitive functions dim. They also have a hard time sleeping at night. \" without stimulation, people's brains will move toward stupor and delirium — and often people won't recover from it, \" the magazine reported, noting many are \" incapable of tolerating their new environment \" when eventually released. Already, woodfox is battling \" serious health problems caused or made worse by his years of close confinement, \" a rep for amnesty international says. Both amnesty and the united nations agree his treatment has been \" inhumane, \" reports time. As many as 80,000 us inmates may be in solitary confinement at any one time, reports christian science monitor, though some states are working to reduce that number amid higher rates of reoffending and suicide among the isolated. Still, some say solitary confinement serves a purpose. \" for some people, solitary confinement is the only responsible way to incarcerate them, \" says a criminal sentencing expert. However, he adds, \" solitary confinement is something that ought to be used as a last resort, because i don't think it promotes mental health, so you're not creating better citizens \" upon release.

        "summary": "The theory that king tut's tomb also holds the remains of his stepmother, the legendary queen nefertiti, has tantalized egyptian archaeology for nearly three years. But after two scans with ground-penetrating radar proved inconclusive, national geographic reports that third major scan is underway at the tomb in luxor's valley of the kings, and it has exclusive photos of the operation. The scan will search the walls of tut's tomb for signs of a hidden chamber and is expected to take about a week, reports cbs news. Several weeks of analysis will then follow. Egyptologist nicholas reeves believed he saw telltale signs — traces of sealed entrances in the north and west walls of tut's tomb — in a 2015 scan. It's also been determined that the north wall was initially painted a different color than the others, while paintings on the wall also follow a different pattern than those on the others. This might suggest the wall — where infrared thermography found temperature variations — was built some time before the others. But though experts said a 2015 scan indicated chambers present behind the north and west walls, a second scan in 2016 found nothing. The third scan, being led by the polytechnic university of turin, aims to settle whether any voids in the rock exist. If so, archaeologists would then begin the next phase of seeing what's inside them. ( tut's dagger is out of this world, literally. )",

        "summary": "If you ever visit gourmet grocers or italian markets, you've probably seen it: imported nutella, straight from italy, sold in a glass jar at multiple times the price of the canadian-made stuff found in most us supermarkets. And perhaps you've wondered: is it really any different? many devotees insist that it is — a blind taste test at serious eats, for example, found that the discrepancy was immediately obvious, with the north american variety tasting \" like sugar, \" and the italian one tasting \" like hazelnuts. \" jim webster at the washington post wanted to get to the bottom of the matter, so he sat down with two jars and italian pastry guru alex levin. The story details their epic quest to break down all the tangible and intangibles of both nutellas. Turns out the ingredients are identical — equal amounts of sugar, hazelnuts, protein, total fat, and more. Both are more than half sugar and thus sweet. The only difference they could suss out was that the north american version, using \" palm oil, \" boasts that it has no trans fat, while the italian version, made with \" vegetable oil, \" doesn't mention trans fats. The imported has a firmer texture and \" sticks to your mouth a little more, \" perhaps providing at least the sense of a more intense flavor by lingering on the palate longer. \" we can't, and don't claim to have solved anything, \" webster writes, but they theorize that the fda's trans fat rules necessitated a change in recipe. After all that, webster says he's still a nutella fan and will keep a jar ( \" probably domestic \" ) in the pantry. But levin whipped up a homemade batch in minutes, and that's going into the rotation.",

Ever since i heard about nutella, the chocolate-hazelnut spread that originated in between-world wars italy, i've been a fan. In mid-1980s america, it was hard to find. Not every supermarket carried it. Obtaining it was a quest, and luck helped. I had to ration it. And no one can prove that i used to hide it when visitors came over. A lot of foods have cult followings, and demand for nutella has resulted in its becoming nearly ubiquitous. As it celebrates the spread's 50th year, maker ferrero rocher reportedly sells about a half-billion pounds across more than 70 countries. There's no more rationing, though there probably should be, because, frankly, my teeth have started to hurt. But maybe there's a way i can avoid cutting back:",

But it's presenting the dc region with a dangerous double-whammy — the ground is sinking at the same time that sea levels are rising because of warming temperatures, say the uv researchers. The study confirms a long-held theory on why sea levels around dc are rising faster than any other stretch along the coast, reports the washington post. \"right now is the time to start making preparations, \" says lead study author ben dejong. \"six extra inches of water really matters in this part of the world. \" he and his team drilled dozens of boreholes around the chesapeake bay to figure out what's happening. The culprit is an ancient ice sheet that covered much of north america, then retreated, and the land is oh-so-slowly settling back into place.

Members of both groups had similar levels of education and cognitive performance.though none of the subjects exhibited any outward signs of dementia, the brain scans revealed that the 11 people whose mothers had alzheimer's had lost significantly more gray matter over the 2-year period than the 10 people whose fathers had the disease and compared with the 32 people with two healthy parents. That cell loss was especially pronounced in two areas of the brain – the left precuneus ( which plays a role in episodic memory, among other functions ) and the left parahippocampas gyrus ( which is involved in encoding and retrieving memories ).other regions that took a hit were \"the anterior cingulate, the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, the right hippocampus, right precuneus, and posterior cingulate, \" according to a study in the march 1 edition of the journal neurology the brains of those whose fathers had alzheimer's disease were essentially the same as those of subjects with no family history. Only having a mother with the disease appeared to influence the degree of brain atrophy.the researchers said they don't know why alzheimer's appears to be more aggressive when inherited from one's mother instead of one's father. Perhaps it's related to mitochondrial dna, which is inherited only from one's mother and which may be responsible for faulty glucose metabolism in brain tissue affected by alzheimer's, they wrote."

Now, however, he's in a legal battle with a developer and would-be neighbor that threatens to make public details about his personal life and finances, reports the new york times. It's a little convoluted, but russian-born developer mircea voskerician accuses zuckerberg of reneging on a promise to introduce him to silicon valley contacts, and one of his court filings demands details about zuckerberg's personal finances. Team zuckerberg, meanwhile, accuses voskerician of extortion and says he's \"going out of his way to embarrass mr. Zuckerberg and pressure those around him. \" as bloomberg previously reported, this began when voskerician sent zuckerberg a letter in 2012 saying he was under contract to buy a property next to zuckerberg's and planned to put up a home with a direct view of zuckerberg's home. However, he said he'd be willing to sell zuckerberg part of the property to buffer his privacy. After negotiations, zuckerberg eventually bought voskerician's rights to the entire property for $ 1.7 million, then paid the owners another $ 4.8 million for the lot, reports business insider. Voskerician says he could have gotten a better deal but took the offer because of zuckerberg's promise. Bloomberg says one 2013 email, from zuckerberg assistant andrea besmehn, could be key: \"i just had a quick chat with mark on this issue — and he said he does remember saying that he would help this guy in a 'light ' way. Is there a way when we chat with him that we can find out a way for us ( not necessarily mark ) to help him with something small? also... We ' ll have to manage this carefully because we don't want to give an inch and then... \" zuckerberg had to give a deposition wednesday. \" stay tuned, \" advises venturebeat. \" zuckerberg's life might become a lot less private in the next few months.

On thursday, a ninth circuit court of appeals in california ruled against bikram choudhury, the founder of bikram yoga, who was attempting to copyright his sequence of 26 yoga poses, nbc news reports. According to the los angeles times, choudhury — who didn't invent the poses, which are thousands of years old — claimed he alone had the right to decide who could teach them in the order he first published in 1979. Choudhury has threatened multiple lawsuits against yoga studios in the ensuing years, often with the studios caving or settling out of court. But one florida studio fought back. Thursday's ruling was in support of evolation yoga's right to teach the 26 poses in any order they like, including choudhury's sequence, nbc reports. The court compared it to a cookbook — in that the cookbook itself can be copyrighted but not the recipes inside of it — and also to surgery. \"the copyright for a book describing how to perform a complicated surgery does not give the holder the exclusive right to perform the surgery, \" the times quotes from the judge's decision. Evolation's lawyer called the ruling \"a very big victory for yoga studios and practitioners everywhere. \" choudhury was instrumental in yoga taking off in the us in the ' 70s, but he's been a controversial figure.

But that riverside sign's history has been a fraught one: it was stolen and never recovered, reports cnn, and the replacement has been on the receiving end of more than 100 bullets over the years. A fresh sign went up in june and sat there, unscarred, for 35 days. On july 26, four bullet holes blighted the sign once more. One bullet pierced the word \" mother, \" in a sentence referencing mamie till mobley's desire \" not to bury her son \" but return him to his hometown chicago. Patrick weems, co-founder of the emmett till interpretive center, says the very nature of the sign's location suggests the shooting was intentional: one has to travel about two miles down a dirt road to get to it. In the wake of the incident, weems says he's accepted an offer to have a fourth sign made, for free and out of steel, which is superior to the metal that's previously been used. Till's case was closed in 2007, but the justice department reopened the case earlier this year after receiving \" new information. \" the doj didn't elaborate, but the development followed the 2017 publication of a book that quotes till's accuser, carolyn bryant donham, as admitting she made up the worst parts of her story.
