        "summary": "With two home runs last night against the detroit tigers, minnesota twin jim thome became the eighth ballplayer ever to hit 600 out of the park. Perhaps most remarkable about this feat is that he achieved it without steroids — unlike many of the other top sluggers of his era, writes tom verducci in sports illustrated. Indeed, \"gentleman jim \" has \"so mastered humility that he has lasted all these years through the thorniest era in baseball history with nary a whiff of controversy or negativity. \" thome played during \"the height of the steroid era, \" from 1995 to 2003, verducci notes. All of the top seven home run hitters from the period have been linked to steroids except thome. Though he's the eighth to join the 600 home run club, he's the fifth to achieve that distinction steroid-free. \"the strongest thing i put into my body is steak and eggs. I just eat. I ' m not a supplement guy. Steroids are not even a thought, \" he once told si.

If there was ever any doubt that thome is a hall of famer, just look at the company he has joined by entering the 600 club: sammy sosa, alex rodriguez, ken griffey jr., willie mays, babe ruth, hank aaron and barry bonds. It's unlikely that, in this new-found era of meticulous drug testing, there will be any additional outbursts of 600-home run sluggers in the next decade similar to what we've seen in recent years. It's simply too hard of a task to accomplish. It requires consistency, health, luck and flat-out skill, all of which are rare to find collectively in a baseball player.

Brown, 46, was freed from a different prison yesterday and the pair embraced surrounded by cheering family members when they were reunited at a sister's home in fayetteville, reports the charlotte observer.

        "summary": "\" american association of poison control centers issues warning about reemerging synthetic drugs. \" that's the title of a strongly worded press release issued yesterday about \" spice \" following an upsurge in hospital visits and calls to state poison control centers due to the drug. Those centers received 1,008 reports of adverse reactions to spice during the first 22 days of april, compared to 892 reports over the first three months of the year. That's a total of 1,900 calls; all of 2014 saw a total of 3,680. The synthetic substance resembles pot but isn't really anything like it: it's treated with chemicals — like pesticides and rat poison — can be 100 times more potent than marijuana, and can cause extreme anxiety, violent behavior, and delusions, the washington post reports. Mississippi, new york, and alabama — which has seen 462 spice-related hospital visits in the past month — have each issued alerts; arizona, florida, new jersey, and texas have also seen a spike in spice cases, the new york times reports. A law enforcement official tells mississippi's sun herald he'd gladly see pot legalized in his state if it meant the spice market would be wiped out as a result, though he thinks spice users wouldn't give up the drug for pot. Another official tells the herald spice is the \" most dangerous \" drug he's ever seen because it can kill almost instantly, and a few of this year's cases have indeed ended in death. The times notes it's unclear whether the bump in spice-related medical cases is due to increased usage or the distribution of a more dangerous variation of it. The press release notes spice's ill effects were first reported in the us in 2009.",

        "summary": "Seth meyers debuted as the newest late night host last night, and critics seem to agree: he did a fine job. There was no huge \" wow \" moment, but neither did he embarrass himself, and the franchise appears to be in capable hands. Some of the things reviewers are talking about: it was very low-key. Meyers had, arguably, the least stressful launch of anyone who's ever taken over a late night show, as tim goodman points out in the hollywood reporter. And he kept things very down-tempo, with none of the razzle-dazzle that marked jimmy fallon's tonight show debut, writes meredith blake in the los angeles times. Most agree meyers'transition into the slot was smooth. It had an old-fashioned feeling. None of the jokes or comedy bits were very original, writes brian lowry in variety. But there was also a throwback tone that some reviewers appreciated: meyers \" constantly held up pictures — real pictures, printed out, \" writes darren franich for entertainment weekly. \" i don't think he said the words'twitter ' or ' facebook ' once in the whole hour. \" it also felt familiar. Numerous reviewers note that \" late night meyers \" — particularly during his monologue — was essentially identical to \" snl ' weekend update ' meyers. \" he's \" still yelling like a fake newscaster, not talking like a real host, \" franich writes. His monologue was \" full of rapid-fire one-liners about the day's headlines, \" blake writes, while goodman found it \" staccato and hit and miss. \" in the new york daily news, david hinckley agrees that the delivery was \" stiff, \" but \" the jokes themselves were pretty good. \" and in usa today, robert bianco writes, \" you get a lot of jokes per minute from meyers, and on monday at least, most of them worked. \" he chose good guests. Critics unanimously agree: meyers has undeniable rapport with his first guest ( and former \" weekend update \" co-host ), amy poehler — and both she and meyers were also great at riffing with bandleader and fellow snl alum fred armisen. Meyers ' chemistry with poehler put him at ease, and when second guest joe biden came on, poehler practically acted as \" co-host, \" lowry writes. Biden is \" also no stranger to tossing off quips without nerves, \" goodman writes, and he knows poehler from his guest bit on parks and recreation — so the three of them had a fun, \" freewheeling \" talk, franich writes. It \" seemed to be an actual conversation",

The crash was a tragic accident, alexandria duval's defense attorney, birney bervar, said in his opening statement.

A witness cleaning a family gravesite on the highway shoulder told police that he heard a woman screaming in the vehicle and that the passenger was pulling the driver's hair and the steering wheel. Anastasia duval was in the passenger seat and was killed; her sister was arrested. A judge later ordered alexandria duval released after finding no probable cause for a murder charge. She traveled to new york state and was arrested months later in albany after a grand jury indicted her. Duval didn't testify. \" i ' m disappointed, \" maui county prosecuting attorney jd kim said after the verdict. \" the facts clearly show it was at least reckless behavior. \" \" you can't imagine losing your twin sister in that kind of catastrophic, tragic accident, then being charged with causing the death of your sister, which she didn't, \" bervar told the maui news. \" she's extremely relieved. \" the sisters, born alison and ann dadow near utica, ny, operated popular yoga studios in florida before they changed their names.

Experts recommend that people worried about eye damage print off an amsler grid and use it to check for vision problems. University of waterloo optometry professor ralph chou tells npr that symptoms won't be apparent for at least 12 hours. After that, he says, people might experience \" blurred vision, where the very center of the vision might have a spot, or multiple spots, that were missing in their vision — that were very, very blurred. Around it, there might be some clear spots. \" he says people worried about damage should see an optometrist, and that while wearing sunglasses won't mitigate the damage, it will make vision more comfortable during recovery. Buzzfeed has rounded up tweets from people complaining about sore eyes after the eclipse. \" my eyes melted, \" claims one person.",

According to a lawsuit seeking more than $ 1 million in damages that the couple filed against texas toyota of grapevine and toyota motor north america, tim gautreaux, 29, handed over his phone to the salesman because he had his application for pre-approved financing saved on an app. The salesman gave the phone to his manager, 44-year-old matthew luke thomas — and thomas allegedly stole nude photos of claire gautreaux, 27, off the phone, the fort worth star-telegram reports. The phone was out of sight for just five minutes, per cbs dfw. When tim gautreaux got his phone back, he opened it to see a year-old photograph of claire \" in a compromising stage of undress, \" per the lawsuit. He then opened an app that saves deleted emails, and saw that an email with financial info had been sent to thomas — but two other emails, which included photos of his wife getting in and out of the bath, had been sent to a swingers ' website. \" these actions have caused the gautreauxs to suffer humiliation and mental anguish, particularly because they do not know who has seen these photographs or may see them in the future, \" said one of their lawyers, gloria allred, per the dallas news.

Which would've been quite alarming, considering the recent hubbub around trump's alleged russia ties — except, as the washington post points out, the dispatch isn't a real paper. And neither are a handful of other \" news \" websites concocted as a promotional ploy for 20th century fox's a cure for wellness, its new gore verbinski mystery-horror flick that opens friday. The marketing scheme backfired, however, fooling many on social media ( including some well-known tweeters ) and leading 20th century fox to issue a statement calling the idea \" inappropriate on every level. \" buzzfeed on monday first made the big reveal about the fakery, which included a slew of phony anti-trump stories, such as the president pulling government support for california after the oroville dam flood because of its pro-immigrant stance. Regency enterprises, one of the film's production companies, tried to explain in a statement, noting the movie was \" about a ' fake ' cure that makes people sicker \" — ostensibly justifying the whole fake-news approach. ( some of the stories prodded readers to react by tweeting their thoughts along with #acureforwellness. ) marketing and ad experts don't agree it was a wise move: richard edelman, ceo of edelman, tells the new york times the tactic is \" perverse \" and \" counterproductive. \" 20th century fox now agrees, noting in its statement, \" in this case, we got it wrong. \"",

The study focused on the high-risk communities within a 700-mile northern california-to-washington stretch of coastline that would be affected by a cascadia subduction zone earthquake. Researchers found that nearly 5,600 additional residents — or another 6 % of the population — would make it to safety in time if they walked to higher ground at a speed of 3.4mph rather than 2.5mph. At 2.5mph, 21,562 residents would be at risk, physorg reports; the researchers put the population of the communities that could be affected by a csz quake at 94,872. Researchers noted that the first tsunami wave from a csz quake would likely hit california and oregon within 15 minutes. \" just by getting people to move faster, you can save thousands of lives, \" lead author nathan wood tells the seattle times. But others are pretty much doomed, per the times, which reports that the study shows many of those living in ocean shores, wash., and seaside, ore., wouldn't be able to evacuate in time even at the faster speed. In these cases, the research team suggests building strong-walled vertical evacuation centers and launching emergency preparedness campaigns. ( some towns are already heeding this advice. ) the pacific northwest seismic network notes that the csz has produced 9.0-magnitude quakes in the past and tends to release a quake at intervals of 400 to 600 years; its last major one was in 1700.

But that leaves 193 bones still to be found, as an archaeologist puts it. In its latest mission in its three decades of searching for earhart, the international group for historic aircraft recovery ( tighar ) will use forensic dogs to search nikumaroro for bones, reports national geographic. As the human body is made up of 206 bones, \" there's real potential for there to be more bones there, \" says tighar archaeologist tom king. The expedition, which departs from fiji on saturday and will also include an underwater search for earhart's plane, per kval — \" is less of a shot in the dark than any expedition we've had, \" says king. Tighar's search for earhart has long focused on nikumaroro based on the theory that earhart got lost on her way to howland island while circumnavigating the globe 80 years ago. The tighar team, including four border collies trained to locate human remains, is expected to arrive at the coral atoll 1,000 miles to the north of fiji in early july. As the dogs have found burial sites as old as 1,500 years, age won't be an issue, but heat could be. \" the dogs are not effective when the ground temperature is over 80 degrees, \" says one of the dog's handlers, though she's optimistic they ' ll be able to pick up scents.

That's what scientists led by the university of aberdeen conclude after observing how mice shed extra weight. In a molecular metabolism study, pointed out by the telegraph and daily record, researchers explain how male mice with increased appetite and reduced physical activity were able to shed extra weight with obesity medication. However, the same medication failed to show much transformation in female mice. \" what we have discovered is that the part of the brain that has a significant influence on how we use the calories that we eat is wired differently in males and females, \" researcher lora heisler explains in a release. Brain hormones called pomc peptides help regulate appetite, physical activity, energy expenditure, and body weight. Male mice who took obesity medication meant to boost the production of pomc peptides enjoyed reduced appetite, as well as increased energy expenditure and physical activity. But female mice saw only their appetite affected. Since most obesity medications in the us target the pomc neurons, researchers say women aren't fully benefiting from treatment. \" currently there is no difference in how obesity is treated in men and women, \" yet the female obesity rate is double that of men in some parts of the world, heisler notes. She adds the study could change how doctors tackle obesity and lead to \" new sex-specific medications. \" ( one possible treatment: freeze-dried poop. )",

It is easier for women to gain weight than men because part of the brain is \" wired differently \" in males and females, a scottish study has found. Researchers say hormones responsible for regulating appetite, physical activity and energy expenditure work differently in the sexes. The discovery could change the way obesity is tackled through targeted medication, experts at the university of aberdeen believe. Working with teams from the university of cambridge and the university of michigan, they used a mouse model to study the sex difference in weight gain driven by differences in physical activity and energy expenditure. During the study, researchers were able to transform obese male mice with increased appetite and reduced physical activity into lean, healthy mice, but the same transformation did not occur in the female mice. The project was led by professor",
            "For many people preventing weight gain can seem like an uphill struggle but scientists led by the university of aberdeen have discovered why it may be even harder for women. Research by the team, led by professor lora heisler from the rowett institute of nutrition and health, could now pave the way for a difference in how obesity is tackled between the sexes. The study was primarily funded by the wellcome trust and bbsrc and is published in the journal molecular metabolism. Leading scientists at the university of aberdeen, university of cambridge and university of michigan used a mouse model to uncover a sex difference in weight gain driven by differences in physical activity and energy expenditure.

        "summary": "It's a huge blow for johnson &amp; johnson, and a huge win for the family of a woman who blamed the company's products for her ovarian cancer. In st. Louis on monday, a jury awarded $ 72 million to the family of alabama's jacqueline fox: $ 10 million in actual damages and $ 62 million — $ 1 million for every year that she lived — in punitive damages, courthouse news reports. Fox, who died in october but testified in a video deposition, said she used the company's talc-based baby powder and shower to shower products for feminine hygiene for 35 years. The family's lawyers said the company covered up evidence the products could cause cancer and the jury agreed, finding johnson &amp; johnson liable for fraud, negligence, and conspiracy, reports reuters. The evidence included internal memos that lawyers argued showed that johnson &amp; johnson was aware of the link between talc and ovarian cancer for more than 30 years but covered it up. Fox's son, marvin salter, became the plaintiff after her death. He tells the st. Louis post-dispatch that johnson &amp; johnson was a company name he had trusted. \" my reaction was disbelief, \" he says. \" how can a company have known about this relationship between talc and ovarian cancer since the 1970s and not disclosed it? \" fox's case was the first to go to court, but there are around 1,200 similar ones in missouri and new jersey. The company says \" the safety of cosmetic talc is supported by decades of scientific evidence \" and it plans to appeal the ruling.

The 78-year-old is currently on trial, charged with felony sex abuse for allegedly having sex last may with his wife, donna, in a nursing home a few days after he was told she wasn't able to consent to intimate relations, the new york times reports. Donna, who died in august, suffered from dementia, with nursing home staff noting she no longer remembered her daughters ' names, how to recall everyday words, or how to eat certain foods. \" you could see that donna had alzheimer's.... She was just in her pleasant little world, \" a nurse from concord care center testified yesterday in garner, per the quad-city times. The center allows residents to have consensual sex, but henry, who wed donna in 2007, was told in a may 15 sit-down with center staff and donna's daughters that donna was unable to consent to sex due to her deteriorating mental state, kimt reports. On may 23, donna's roommate complained about henry's visit, and a surveillance camera shows henry leaving the room that day and dropping what's reported to have been donna's underwear in a hamper; henry was arrested shortly after his wife died a few months later. Although experts cited by the times suggest dementia patients can benefit from such intimacy, dr. John brady, the nursing home's physician, compared a patient's receptive responses to sexual advances to those of a baby responding to love from its mother, the des moines register reports. \" i don't believe an infant makes an informed decision, \" brady testified, per the register.

        "summary": "A new study suggests that ancient mars not only had an ocean, it experienced a tsunami unlike anything we've seen on earth, reports cosmos. The study in the journal of geophysical research — planets identifies a 75-mile-wide crater in the north as the likely source, reports the bbc. The scientists theorize that an asteroid smashed into the planet 3 billion years ago, creating the lomonosov crater and triggering the tsunami. Researchers point to \" thumbprint terrain \" — so named because it resembles ridges on a human thumb — on the planet's parched surface whose geological formations suggest massive water movement, reports the christian science monitor. \" it was a really large-scale, high speed tsunami, \" says french researcher francois gostard. The initial wave from the impact would have been nearly 1,000 feet high, with waves about 300 feet high crashing ashore hours later. Previous research has suggested that mud flows or glacier movements are responsible for the thumbprint, but \" it's very hard to conceive of any other process other than a tsunami \" that could have etched out these precise formations, says gostard. The existence of an ancient martian ocean is actually still debated, which is what american co-author stephen clifford finds most intriguing about the tsunami evidence. It means \" there must have been an ocean present in the northern plains, \" he says. \" that's the key point here — it indicates that there was a substantial amount of water in residence on the martian surface. \" ( maybe even a mile deep? )",

A charcoal drawing of a nude mona lisa that has been sitting in a museum north of paris for 150 years is now believed to be the work of the master himself, not one of his students as earlier thought, the bbc reports. The conde museum sent the portrait, which is known as the \" joconde nue \" and can be seen here, to the louvre for testing and discovered that it was older than thought, dating from da vinci's lifetime, and was likely created in his workshop. Researchers believe the sketch may have been da vinci's preparation for painting a nude version of his masterpiece. According to accounts from the time, da vinci painted a nude mona lisa that disappeared two years after his death in 1519. \" it's possible, though there's no certainty, that this was the preparatory drawing for the painted joconde nue, \" conde curator mathieu deldicque tells the times of london. \" we don't even know if that portrait was really painted but there's a strong probability that it was. What has tipped us off are retouches. There are little clues. \" da vinci was left-handed and some of the cross-hatching was done by a right-handed person, but those touches could have been added after the work was created, researchers say.

        "summary": "Fungal diseases have hit species including frogs and bats, and now one is taking a toll on north american snake populations, national geographic reports. Some 30 snake species in 15 us states and canada have been hit hard by snake fungal disease, though rattlesnakes appear to be at particularly high risk, notably the endangered eastern massasauga. The disease causes lesions and blisters that when spread to a reptile's head can result in starvation. Since snakes hunt rodents, which spread ticks and parasites, their absence could lead to other problems. \" this is especially important now, with talk of this being one of the worst lyme disease years that we've had in a long time, \" biologist jonathan kolby tells national geographic. Fungal diseases that have also afflicted other animal populations remain mysterious. The disease is caused by o. Ophiodiicola, a fungus identified in snakes as far back as 1880, though the fatal lesions began to appear only in 2000, per the bbc. How the pathogen spreads is unclear. \" we don't know where exactly they came from or why they suddenly appear to be more virulent, \" kolby says. Another expert points to habitat destruction or cooler, wetter spring climates that drive snakes underground for longer periods where they are more vulnerable to infection. Kolby is concerned the us could be the source of the disease, which has also been spotted in captive snakes in england, australia, and germany. The pet trade may be spreading the pathogen unknowingly via clothing and boots, per healthy pets. ( it turns out snakes are not \" solitary and stupid. \" )",

Afterward, it can be reused 20 times with no significant decline in quality, phys.org reports. What's more, \" this rewritable paper does not require additional inks for printing, making it both economically and environmentally viable, \" says a researcher. Instead of ink being used to create words and images, the new printing process works in what you might call the opposite way. The \" paper \" ( actually a film made of glass or plastic, engadget reports, though a paper version is in the works ) comes in red, blue, and green, and the printing process bleaches it where text doesn't appear, instead of adding ink where it does. Exposure to oxygen eventually \" erases \" the text by returning the bleached sections to their original color, but not before the paper has served a purpose: \" the printed letters remain legible with high resolution at ambient conditions for more than three days — long enough for practical applications such as reading newspapers, \" the researcher notes. Heating can speed up the erasing process to as little as 10 minutes.

The drug, also known by the brand name aromasin, is currently used to help prevent recurrences of breast cancer. But the findings suggest that women at higher risk because of family history or other reasons could take the drug to stop breast cancer from occurring altogether, notes the new york times. The side effects were minimal. \"this is a major step forward, \" says an expert at the memorial sloan-kettering cancer center who was not involved in the research. Others cautioned that a three-year study is too short to draw long-term conclusions about the practice of giving healthy women — they're just at risk, not diagnosed — a drug for years on end. Aromasin costs $ 300 to $ 400 a month, but pfizer's patent expired in april, and the price is expected to come down significantly, notes the los angeles times.

A police spokesman told reporters that the bomb squad was called in after suspicious items were found in the man's car, and officers are investigating \" items of interest \" inside the theater, where there are still bodies, including that of the shooter, the daily advertiser reports. Five things to know: police say at least seven people were injured, some critically, ranging in age from their teens to their 60s, reports the new york times. One victim who underwent surgery is \" not doing well, \" a police spokesman says. The shooting occurred at a 7: 10pm showing of the romantic comedy trainwreck. Star amy schumer tweeted: \" my heart is broken and all my thoughts and prayers are with everyone in louisiana. \" gov. Bobby jindal, who traveled to the scene, said he had spoken to two teachers who acted heroically after the man began shooting, apparently at random, 20 minutes into the movie, the ap reports. One teacher jumped in front of another, probably saving her life, jindal says, and the second teacher was able to ring the fire alarm to alert moviegoers despite having been shot in the leg. Police say there were around 100 people in the theater when the man opened fire, and he was dead by the time they got there, cnn reports. A witness in a neighboring theater says he heard \" gunshots after gunshots, \" which he thought was part of a movie until alarms started going off. The shooting comes three years to the week after james holmes killed 12 people in a colorado movie theater, the ap notes.

The study, published in the journal critical social work, isn't talking about \" lifestyle \" vampires, who might wear fake fangs or don a black cape, but rather true vampirism, which \" centers on claims of needing extra energy \" — that would be blood — \" regularly in order to sustain health. \" dj williams, who's studied self-identified vampires for almost a decade, interviewed 11 individuals from the us and south africa who say they need to drink others ' blood for this reason, reports reuters. After quizzing them about their psychiatric backgrounds, careers, and social lives, he found them much like everyone else. Though some have a habit of cutting into the chests of willing donors to ingest a small amount of blood — a non-fatal procedure — they also \" work regular jobs and participate in the broader communities in which they live. \" one standout point, williams says: they're generally unwilling to visit a therapist or doctor though they may face \" stress, various health issues, relationship difficulties, \" and other struggles just like the rest of us. Many so-called vampires worry they ' ll be labeled a psychopath, or \" perhaps wicked, and not competent to perform in typical social roles, such as parenting, \" the study notes. Real vampires feel they had no choice about their identity, with some saying they wish they were free of their condition. \" most vampires believe they were born that way; they don't choose this, \" williams tells reuters, and his study encourages \" helping professionals... To become more aware of their own social and cultural positioning so that these do not unintentionally harm clients whose backgrounds and beliefs differ. \" curious how many vampires walk among us? williams suspects there are thousands.

The islamic state, which controls territory in syria and iraq, has already beheaded two american journalists and one british aid worker in recent weeks in what it said was reprisal for u.s.

The city's been locked in a well-documented downward spiral, but whose fault is that? here are what some pundits are saying: racism and corporate greed were the main culprits, argues mark binelli at the guardian. Detroit suffered from \" a history of abandonment, neglect, isolation, and outright hostility born directly out of racial tensions that have historically divided detroit from its predominantly white suburbs, \" from betrayal by the big three automakers, \" those pioneers of job outsourcing, \" and from the financial collapse and jobless recovery wall street has authored nationwide. There are two lessons here for other governments, the detroit news warns: first, \" debt does matter, \" even though washington seems desperate to pretend it doesn't. Second, the city \" lost focus on its core mission, which should have been providing essential services to residents. … a government that focuses on serving its taxpayers first is less likely to lose its tax base. \" \" we should never blame the victims, \" writes rochelle riley at the detroit free press, but retired city employees \" have spent years counting on detroit city officials to forever keep promises \" that they clearly couldn't. The pension crisis — retirees outnumber current workers 21,000 to 9,700 — has been \" a financial tsunami that began heading for detroit years ago. Yet not a word from retirees. Where were y ' all? \" daniel hannan at the telegraph notes the striking similarity between detroit and ayn rand's fictional dystopia starnesville. And in real life, as in atlas shrugged, the culprit was \" leftist administrations \" that have \" spent too much and borrowed too much, driving away business and becoming a tool of the government unions. \"",

' \" it's a line from joanna connors ' national geographic september cover story, which follows 21-year-old katie stubblefield as she becomes the youngest person on the planet to receive a face transplant. A photo within the article depicts those words exactly, giving credence to connors ' opening line: \" this story is difficult to look at. \" but she asks the reader to continue with her on a deep dive that weaves together stubblefield's journey with reflections on what our face says about who we are and background on how such a surgery is even possible. Stubblefield lost her face by her own hand: as an 18-year-old high school senior dealing with medical issues, her mother's job loss, and a breakup, she impulsively shot herself in the face with a.308-caliber hunting rifle in 2014. Her brother kicked in the bathroom door and found a girl who connors writes \" could have walked off the cover of seventeen magazine \" now without her nose, mouth, and much of her jaws; her eyes remained but no longer aligned; she had suffered traumatic brain injury. Her life was saved in memphis and she was transferred to the cleveland clinic in ohio, where 15 specialists \" patched her face \" ( connors explains how ). Then, a new face was found: that of adrea schneider, who had died from a drug overdose. On the morning of may 4, 2017, schneider's face was removed and transplanted onto stubblefield in a 31-hour operation that involved a crucial decision mid-way through. Connors tracks the surgery in detail, as well as the months that followed. Read the full story, which is the product of years of reporting, and see many photos here.",

The mayor is preparing to announce an ambitious 10-year plan to make computer science education available in all the city's public schools, reports the new york times, which notes that under 10 % of the city's schools offer such programs now and that only around 1 % of students actually go through them. Chicago and san francisco have announced similar initiatives, but they face the same problem new york will: a huge shortage of people qualified to teach it. New york believes the plan will involve training around 5,000 teachers, some of whom will teach computer science exclusively, per the times. The $ 81 million project will include private funding. \" the difficulty is getting enough teachers who are trained in it, and trained well enough to make it a good introduction to computer science, \" the director of computing outreach at georgia tech's college of computing tells the times. \" and if you are well-trained in computer science, you can make a lot more money in industry than [ in ] teaching. \" de blasio is expected to announce the plan at a school in the bronx today, where he ' ll also roll out other initiatives aimed at low-income students, including extra reading specialists to help struggling early learners, the wall street journal reports.

Bernanke also gave little satisfaction to liberal critics. This meeting tested what the fed was willing to do when the economy was merely muddling along, and the answer that came back: nothing new. Asked several times why the fed had paused if jobs are a problem and inflation is not, mr. Bernanke offered a description but not an explanation: the fed is willing and able to do more, he said, just not right now. The fed's economic forecasts do not have a particularly",

Among the factors hillary clinton will need to consider in a running mate are whether the us is ready for an all-female ticket and whether she wants a \" rising star or a seasoned hand. \" it's actually a conversation that has been going on for some two years, \" and truthfully, longer, \" writes chris cillizza of the washington post. Per the times, clinton \" cares less about ideological and personal compatibility than about picking a winner \" who will create a sharp contrast to the republican ticket. Both the times and the post are floating these five names as possible clinton running mates: sherrod brown: the senator from ohio could help \" secure the buckeye state, \" per the times. But, the post notes, picking him puts a sought-after senate seat in play. Julian castro: the federal housing secretary, says the post, complements clinton \" in virtually every way, demographically speaking. \" tim kaine: the senator from virginia speaks spanish and plays harmonica, per the times, but may be \" too obvious a pick to make a splash. \" amy klobuchar: an \" up and coming star, \" per the post, the senator from minnesota may be the female that the clinton campaign has said will be on its shortlist of possible vps tom perez: the labor secretary is \" well regarded in liberal circles, and he's hispanic, \" the post notes. On the downside, he's unknown, has no foreign policy experience, and isn't \" young or handsome, \" a politico profile observes.

But pruitt had also been dogged for months by a seemingly unending string of ethics scandals that spawned more than a dozen federal and congressional investigations. He was forced out following a series of revelations involving pricey trips with first-class airline seats and unusual security spending, including a $ 43,000 soundproof booth for making private phone calls. He also demanded 24-hour-a-day protection from armed officers, resulting in a swollen 20-member security detail that blew through overtime budgets and racked up expenses of more than $ 3 million. Pruitt also had ordered his epa staff to do personal chores for him, picking up dry cleaning and trying to obtain a used trump hotel mattress for his apartment. He had also enlisted his staff to contact conservative groups and companies to find a lucrative job for his unemployed wife, including emails seeking a chick-fil-a franchise from a senior executive at the fast-food chain. Pruitt's job had been in jeopardy since the end of march, when abc news first reported that he leased a capitol hill condo last year for just $ 50 a night. It was co-owned by the wife of a veteran fossil fuels lobbyist whose firm had sought regulatory rollbacks from epa.",
