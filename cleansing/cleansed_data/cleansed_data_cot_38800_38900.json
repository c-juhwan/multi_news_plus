Members of the top hat-wearing inner circle announced the \" forecast \" at sunrise, just before 7: 30 a.m. Tuesday.

            "By charles roop february 2, 2016 welcome to february. It's the month where couples frantically search for the perfect gift and restaurant reservations, or face the threat of sleeping in the dog house ( i ' m working on it, babe! ). It's also the time where people in punxsutawney, penn. And across the country wait to see a groundhog's shadow. The legend of punxsutawney phil, the rodent of such desire, began a long time ago not in the united states, but in europe, according to the the punxsutawney groundhog club's website. It stems from early christians in europe and associated with candlemas day. If the sun made an appearance on that day and an animal ( usually, a hedgehog ) cast its shadow, it would call for six more weeks of bad weather. They called that extra length of bad weather a \"second winter. \" pennsylvania's german settlers found out that the land was full of groundhogs, which resembled the european hedgehog, according to the club's website. They figured that the rodent was intelligent enough to hide once it encountered its shadow, thus signaling a longer winter. And the legend continues to this day on february 2. Appearances of the groundhog were usually private, but a newspaper posted punxsutawney's appearance in 1886. Since then, the groundhog has been an attraction that has brought thousands of people to see him. It's written on the club's website that phil"

        "summary": "Twins are rare, occurring in roughly 2 % of all pregnancies. Of those, monoamniotic twins — in which the babies share both a placenta and amniotic sac — are even more uncommon, happening in fewer than 1 % of all instances of twins. But what makes an iowa woman's pregnancy absolutely singular is that she was pregnant with monoamniotic twins without knowing it. As whotv reports, shelby magnani was having stomach pains, particularly a \" sharp pain \" on her left side, so she went to a walk-in clinic. \" they said, ' we think you might be pregnant, ' \" she tells the station. \" they told me i was six months [ along ] and told me to get down to the er \" for an ultrasound. That's when the ankeny woman and fiance james croskey learned it was twins. This type of pregnancy is highly complicated: the mortality rate is about 50 %, with the biggest worry being that the umbilical cords could get tangled in such a small space — the children's hospital of wisconsin likens the cords to a garden hose, explaining that if they \" flatten or bend, the supply line can be damaged or cut off, \" impeding development or even causing death. Dr. Jennifer krupp explains that \" we bring the patients into the hospital at 24 to 26 weeks, so we can monitor the babies several times a day. \" but as whotv reports, magnani \" missed out on the worst part of having monoamniotic twins: the worry. \" how fast it happened: on oct. 6, croskey posted on facebook that he was throwing a huge halloween party; three days later, he posted a request for a ride to mercy hospital — followed by an album of his girls. The identical ava and anna entered the world via c-section on thursday, weighing 4 pounds, 6 ounces and 3 pounds, 12 ounces, respectively. Though they ' ll need to stay in the nicu, they're expected to be fine. ( another woman recently gave birth hours after learning she was pregnant. )",

            "Birth defects in monochorionic twin a birth defect or anomaly is a medical term meaning irregular or different from normal. Anomalies occur more frequently in identical twins than in other pregnancies. What are the different kinds of twins? monochorionic twins are identical twins who share one placenta. This occurs in approximately 70 percent of pregnancies with identical twins. Monochorionic-monoamniotic twins are identical twins who share both a placenta and an amniotic sac. Monochorionic-diamniotic twins are identical twins who share a placenta but not an amniotic sac. Dichorionic twins each have their own placenta and amniotic sac. This occurs in approximately 30 percent of pregnancies of identical twins. All fraternal ( non-identical ) twins also are dichorionic twins. Problems that can affect the health of monochorionic twins include: prenatal diagnosis of monochorionic twin anomalies doctors typically detect monochorionic twin pregnancies during a routine prenatal ultrasound. The best images are visible when ultrasounds are conducted prior to 14 weeks of pregnancy. This is when the structures of the placenta and amniotic sac are most visible. The ultrasound will show a single placenta supplying blood flow and two fetuses with a single, thin dividing membrane if they are monochorionic twins. At this point, the ultrasound may also show if there is one amniotic sac or two. If there are two, physicians will look to see if there are differences in the amount of amniotic",

        "summary": "Napa valley was once known for its cheap wines. Today it's one of the best wine regions in the world — due in part to peter mondavi. The wine pioneer who helped put california wines on the map died at his home in st. Helena on saturday, says a family rep. He was 101. During more than half a century running charles krug winery — which his italian-immigrant parents bought in 1943 — mondavi adopted sterile filtration, the use of cold fermentation for white wines, and was the first in napa to import french oak barrels for aging, earning him a lifetime achievement award from the napa valley vintners trade group, report the ap and los angeles times. He is also in the culinary institute of america's vintners hall of fame. Mondavi's reign as president and ceo of charles krug winery wasn't without controversy. For a time, mondavi ran the winery with his brother, robert. After a fistfight in 1965, however, robert was removed from management and went on to create his own robert mondavi winery, reports the wall street journal. Like many napa wineries, the robert mondavi winery was eventually bought out, but peter mondavi was proud to say that the charles krug winery remained within the family. It's now run by his two sons, though mondavi retained the titles of president and ceo until last year. He said his energy into old age was thanks to good genes, hard work, pasta bolognese, and a glass of cabernet sauvignon each day.",

And now those teams have unearthed bits of industrial sewing machines dating back to the 1800s at the stockton street site, suggesting a sewing factory may have once occupied the land where the chinese americans citizens alliance now sits, reports the new historian. And while rusty sewing machines may not sound sexy, adrian praetzellis of the anthropological studies center at sonoma state university calls the find \" unprecedented, \" saying these pieces could be our only clues to life in that specific area more than a century ago. The university is among half a dozen archaeological consultants working at the city's many construction sites, and dana shew, an oral historian and archaeologist at sonoma state, will now study the merchant file for the site's former address, 1018 stockton st., to try to scare up the names of those who once used the machines. Found 8 feet below street level, the current hypothesis is that the machines were in the basement of a chinatown factory that was likely felled by the 1906 earthquake or the ensuing fire that leveled much of the area, reports the san francisco examiner. \" there's very little that remains of chinatown prior to the [ 1906 ] earthquake, so this is basically the last remains of the earliest chinatown, \" says praetzellis.

Among the opposition's biggest complaints: that the 60-day deal doesn't bring enough \" stability \" to the middle class or to doctors and that it would give obama ammunition for his state of the union address, allowing him to \" wag his finger \" at congress.",

Various opposition groups threw their support behind him today, none more significant than the controversial muslim brotherhood. Elbaradei addressed the throngs at a rally in downtown cairo, despite the curfew that exists in name only, reports reuters: \" i ask of you patience, change is coming in the next few days, \" he said. \" you have taken back your rights and what we have begun, cannot go back. \" in a separate interview with cnn, he said mubarak could save the country by leaving immediately. The development came as the military increased its presence in cairo and elsewhere — including flyovers by fighter jets — but again took no steps against protesters. At one point, jubilant demonstrators lifted a captain in uniform onto their shoulders, notes the new york times. The hated police remained awol, though the interior ministry said they'd be redeployed tomorrow. As for the closely watched muslim brotherhood, leslie gelb at the daily beast warns that any rise in power for the mb would be \" calamitous for us security \" given the group's support of \" hamas and other terrorist groups. \" and if it does gain control, \" it's going to be almost impossible for the people to take it back, \" he warns. \" just look at iran. \"",

        "summary": "The doomed south korean ferry had 46 lifeboats, but according to a report from cnn's south korean affiliate ytn, just one was deployed as the ferry sank yesterday. Cnn has not independently confirmed the report, though video from another network shows at least 12 survival capsules, which house the lifeboats, remained attached to the ferry. Who did apparently make it off the ship in a lifeboat? the captain, who coast guard officials say boarded one just 32 minutes after the accident was reported, according to abc news. The latest developments: another big problem: the initial orders issued over the pa system were for passengers to don a life jacket but remain in place rather than try to escape, which may have been a fatal mistake. A crew member explains to the ap that no immediate evacuation order was issued because officers were attempting to stabilize the vessel after it started to tilt. He says an evacuation order was given by the captain 30 minutes later, but he wasn't sure if it went out over the pa; some survivors say they never heard it. The delayed evacuation order also likely kept lifeboats from being deployed, the ap notes. One survivor says passengers couldn't break the windows, and thus got stuck inside rooms. Maritime police are still working under the assumption that some survived. A coast guard spokesperson says divers ( there are more than 500 on the scene ) intend to pump oxygen into the ferry, but right now, strong currents are keeping them from doing so. Rain and low visibility are also hampering the search, the wall street journal reports, but there is a plan to raise the submerged ferry out of the water with help from a private shipping company. Cnn also has more of the wrenching text messages sent from trapped passengers to their loved ones. \" there are a few people in the ship, \" one student wrote to his mother, \" and we are not dead yet, so please send along this message. \" however, it's not clear when the messages were sent. The journal says some were allegedly sent early this morning — but it also notes that some of the messages tell of corpses in the halls. Another passenger speculates in a text sent to his brother, \" the ship got hit by something. \" but officially, the cause of the accident remains unknown, though survivors say there was a loud thump before the boat began to tilt. The ferry captain, who could face charges of negligence and accidental homicide, has only apologized and said he is \" deeply ashamed. \"",

        "summary": "The first turn that took malaysia airlines flight 370 off course was made through a computer system, not by manual operation of the plane's controls, reports the new york times, citing \" senior american officials \" involved in the investigation. Officials say the \" seven or eight keystroke \" change was entered into the flight management system, located on a pedestal that sits between the pilot and co-pilot, leading investigators to take a harder look at the two men. It's not clear whether the route was changed before or after the plane took off. Experts say whoever made the change would have to be familiar with boeing aircraft, and it is far-fetched to think a passenger could have programmed the new route. More: china says it has begun searching a huge chunk of territory for any trace of the flight — but an investigation has turned up no sign that any of the 153 chinese nationals on board had anything to do with the jet's disappearance. At a press conference in malaysia today, china's ambassador told reporters that beijing had \" conducted meticulous investigation into all the [ chinese ] passengers, and did not find any evidence for sabotage activity, \" the guardian reports. The chinese announcement significantly shortens the list of possible suspects, and will probably dampen speculation that uighur separatists were involved, cnn notes. As the search continues along vast northern and southern arcs from the plane's last known location, the us says it has removed the navy ship uss kidd from the effort, reports the bbc. Officials say the ship, which has been searching the andaman sea, was taken off the search because \" long-range patrol aircraft \" are more suitable for searching the expanded search area.",

But then donald trump came along and moved into the oval office, a fact that winfrey says has made her rethink her original assessment. \" i thought, ' oh gee, i don't have the experience, i don't know enough. ' … and now i ' m thinking — oh, \" she told rubenstein, who added \" it's clear \" that a resume packed with government know-how is no longer required for the job. Variety reports that what wasn't clear was oprah's seriousness on the matter, though it notes she was an active participant in barack obama's two presidential runs, taking part in fundraisers and rallies. She was also a hillary clinton supporter, though she said in october she didn't make more noise on that front because she didn't think anyone would hear her over all of the \" disgusting vitriol, \" per the huffington post.

In november, bradley moss sued his former fiancee, amy bzura, for the return of said engagement ring after their planned october nuptials did not come to pass, though no explanation for calling it quits was given; that suit is still pending. Now, bzura's family has filed its own lawsuit against moss ' family over the whole mess, and the new york post has the details. It seems that on oct. 28, 2016, the night before the wedding, a brawl erupted at the rehearsal dinner in manhattan. For reasons not clear, moss ' parents did not want bzura's brother to make his toast, and moss ' father even threatened to kick him out, the lawsuit declares. The mother of the groom got involved, and then the groom's brother hit the bride's brother, per the suit. The groom's dad, while being held back by the father of the bride, allegedly attempted to charge the bride's brother. The bizarre night ended with moss'dad threatening to cut his son out of his will and the family business if he went through with the wedding, and moss ' mom calling guests to let them know the wedding was off, according to the lawsuit. The reason for the new suit: bzura's dad says he was footing the bill for the $ 325,000 wedding, and that once it was canceled, moss'dad agreed to pay for the $ 89,919 portion that covered his son's 79 guests — but hasn't actually paid up yet. The moss ' lawyer says the suit is \" bogus, ' while a blogger at jezebel marvels: \" this story still takes the worst rehearsal dinner cake, then smashes that cake on the ground. \" and cosmopolitan is curious about the brother's toast that never was: \" what the hell was adam going to say?! \" ( this wedding went on, but then the salmonella kicked in. )",

( it's not an \" iwatch, \" though, just apple watch. ) the device will start at $ 349 and be available early next year. ( that's about $ 100 higher than the competition, notes the wall street journal. ) buyers will have a choice between stainless steel or 18-karat gold, along with all kinds of bells and whistles. Sample: the watch will buzz your wrist when it's time to make a turn while walking, reports gizmodo. Here's one quick assessment, via henry blodget of business insider: \" apple watch best of smart watches so far, but zero interest, especially given need for iphone to make it work, \" he tweeted. Before the watch — the company's first major entry in a new product category since the ipad's debut in 2010 — ceo tim cook introduced the company's larger phones, the iphone 6 and the iphone 6 plus. They won't just have bigger screens; they ' ll have a new, horizontal viewing mode to take advantage of the larger display. The iphone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen and starts at $ 199 with a two-year contract. The iphone 6 plus has a 5.5-inch screen and starts at $ 299. Both will ship on sept. 19. Apple also introduced a system for using the phone to make credit card payments at retail stores, called apple pay. ( it will work with the watch, too. ) today's event included a live performance by u2, whose new album, songs of innocence, is going out for free on itunes.",

            "Let's run down the list of things we expect today. It's a sure bet apple will show a new iphone, and nearly a sure bet it will show two of them. What's more interesting than seeing a slab of hard sapphire or glass is how apple intends to use the extra real estate. Is it just bigger apps, or will there be some intuitive functionality no one has thought of yet? it's highly likely apple will show a watch. While it's been reported that the wearable might come in two sizes, it's a safer bet to presume apple will show one prototype today. I'd call it a flag-plant so that apple can say it pulled the wraps off of a new category in 2014, even if it can't ship until next year. Will geoff and joanna get to hold it and try it, or will it be behind some barrier? the logical expectation for the big white building is that it is a \"connected home \" type of demo — or an apple museum. But an \"apple home of tomorrow \" is much more interesting. People need to see how something like homekit works, not just talk about gadget design. And apple will probably give more insight into healthkit too. ( dr. Oz is there,"

But a little more work — or even a lot — is required first, afp reports. The company, spaceport sweden, is building a unique vessel that combines a space shuttle with an airplane. And director karin nilsdotter is already counting the customers who will trek to the town of kiruna: \" even if it's too early to give any figures, market studies show there is potential for 14,000 travellers after 10 years of business, \" she says. But she says the technology \" isn't fully developed yet \" and competitors like virgin atlantic are already launching test flights in the us. A few things are going for her, however: kiruna has a 60-year history of space research, there's little air traffic to clutter things up, and wide-open spaces within sweden ensure there's no red tape with other countries. Still, the head of a space research and rocket site in town offers a cautionary note: \" in a few years there may be commercial space flights, but it will take longer than people think. \"",

Phillips'shop refused to make a cake last year that was blue on the outside and pink on the inside after scardina revealed she wanted it to celebrate her transition from male to female. She asked for the cake on the same day the us supreme court announced it would consider phillips ' appeal of the previous commission ruling against him. In that 2012 case, he refused to make a wedding cake for same-sex couple charlie craig and dave mullins. The supreme court ruled in june that the colorado commission showed anti-religious bias when it sanctioned phillips for refusing to make the cake, voting 7-2 that it violated phillips ' first amendment rights. But the court did not rule on the larger issue of whether businesses can invoke religious objections to refuse service to gays and lesbians. ( much more on both cases here. )",

The act will be punishable of up to 1 year in prison, a $ 1,000 fine, or both. One in 8 internet users in the u.s.

Some theories: blame the soviets. During the cold war, the eastern bloc sunk untold money and energy into high-profile figure skating, writes scott beaulier — totally blotting out the swedes, finns, norwegians, danes, and icelanders. Blame world war ii. The conflict canceled the winter games for 12 years, and scandinavians just lost interest, posits jc bradbury. Too much ice. Ice occurs naturally up there, tyler cowen writes, so there's little need to build the indoor rinks where the top skaters hone their craft year around.

They found the baby, later named katheryn deprill, just hours old, wrapped in a maroon shirt and lying on top of a plastic bag. Deprill's mother was never found, and the infant was adopted and raised happily. But deprill always wondered about her birth mother, and on march 2 she launched a public search via facebook for her, which netted almost 33,000 shares. Little did she know that about six months ago, her birth mother had launched her own search. When she heard deprill was looking for her, she got in touch with a lawyer — and the two women met at his office monday, the morning call reports. \" it was pure shock to see it was actually her standing there, \" says deprill, now 28. \" the first thing i got was my hug that i wanted. \" then, she got answers. Her birth mother ( who remains publicly unidentified ) explained that she was raped and impregnated while on a family vacation in a foreign country at 16. She hid the pregnancy from her family and gave birth in secret, in her bedroom, at 17. She then brought deprill to burger king because she knew someone at the crowded restaurant would find her. \" she did not want to throw me away, \" deprill tells wfmz. \" she was a kid in high school, \" explains the birth mom's lawyer. \" back then, you couldn't just go to a hospital and drop the baby off, no questions asked. \" deprill has said she's not interested in pressing charges — she described her feelings after meeting her birth mom as \" pure joy \" and said she forgives her \" 110 %, absolutely, \" the ap reports — and the two plan on continuing their relationship.",

The tour — \" first folio! the book that gave us shakespeare \" — kicks off this week with copies going to notre dame university, norman, okla., and eugene, ore. First folios will be on display at each tour stop for three to four weeks, per the folger library, and only a max of six will travel ( in custom-built traveling cases ) at any one time. The folger library has the largest collection of shakespeare materials, according to the eugene register-guard, and npr notes that first folios are kept on a lower level of the library. To reach them, one must go through a fire door, a heavy safe door, an alarmed door, yet another door, and then take an elevator down to a vault.

The upshot of the report is that the cia was the culprit behind more than half of the ufo sightings logged in the 1950s and 1960s. As venturebeat reports, the cia tested its u-2 spy planes at 60,000 feet, an altitude that seemed impossible for man to reach at the time — leading observers, specifically pilots, to suspect it wasn't man up there at all. Venturebeat highlights a portion of the report that explains that in the mid-1950s, most commercial airliners stuck below 20,000 feet; military aircraft kept it below 40,000 feet. \" consequently, once u-2s started flying at altitudes above 60,000 feet, air-traffic controllers began receiving increasing numbers of ufo reports. \" the cia actually cross-checked the ufo reports with its flight records, it noted in the document, but in instances when it verified the ufo was really a u-2, it stayed mum. The report was part of documents declassified in 2013 that famously detailed the existence of area 51 in nevada.

        "summary": "To further attempts to impose longer waiting periods and more stringent restrictions, abortion opponents have long used the argument that women suffer negative mental health after undergoing the procedure. That theory may have just been quashed by a new study that indicates 95 % of women who've had an abortion felt their decision was the right one — both immediately afterward and three years later, think progress reports. In research published in plos one that tapped data from the turnaway longitudinal study, scientists from the advancing new standards in reproductive health think tank followed 956 women who sought abortions in 21 states and interviewed them every six months for five years. The study is said to be the first in the us to follow women who had abortions ( and those denied them ) over time, as well as study differences between women who received first-trimester abortions and those who received them later. Not only did the overwhelming majority of women feel ok with their choice to end the pregnancy, but relief was the emotion they felt most after three years. Emotional intensity overall was reduced as time passed, whether those feelings were positive or negative, the study notes. Women who reported the most negative emotions were those who had ended planned pregnancies ( i.e., after finding out the fetus had serious health defects ) and those who lived in communities where abortion was more stigmatized, think progress notes; meanwhile, women who were working or in school while pregnant felt most comfortable with their decision, per the study. Perhaps most surprising, researchers found \" no differences in emotional trajectories or decision rightness between women having earlier versus later procedures. \" ( scotus recently quashed north carolina's attempt to force women to listen to \" narrated ultrasounds \" before getting an abortion. )",

        "summary": "Many scientific discoveries can be attributed to a happy accident — the discovery of penicillin thanks to moldy petri dishes, for instance. Might our mounting plastic crisis be solved similarly? one scientist and amateur beekeper in spain has discovered that the larvae of wax moths, which live on beeswax and thus frustrate bees and their keepers, appear to have quite the appetite for plastic, not to mention the highly unusual ability to digest it, reports the guardian. As the scientist explains in the journal current biology, the grubs that she removed from one of her hives and then tossed in a plastic bag chewed their way out in minutes. These critters are often bred as fish bait, and the times of london notes the irony: worms that usually lead to the demise of fish may point toward a way of saving their habitat instead. Scientists have previously discovered that certain bacteria and fungi can break down polyethylene in the lab, but the process takes a long time, measured in months, reports the los angeles times. In a world where americans alone generate 33 million tons of plastic a year, less than 10 % of which we recycle, per the epa, that's not going to cut it. The new study raises the possibility that scientists could unleash the worms on waste in the oceans and elsewhere, though more research is needed. For example, if the worms ate their way through the plastic simply to escape, that's one thing. \" but if they're munching it to use as an energy source, it's a completely different ball game, \" says a cambridge researcher. ( this whale was found with 30 plastic bags in its stomach. )",

First kaufman's brother michael, who presided over the new york city event, revealed that he's not sure whether his famous comedian brother really died of cancer at the age of 35 in 1984 ( conspiracy theories have long held that he faked his death ). Michael said he found, among andy's things, plans to fake his own death; he also claimed to have received a letter from andy in 1999 saying he had a wife and daughter and wanted to remain in hiding and live a normal life. In the letter, he asked michael not to reveal anything while their father was still alive; he just died this summer. A month after their father's death, a young woman contacted michael to confirm andy was still alive and was her father, michael continued. She said kaufman liked to watch the awards he inspired from afar. So monday night, michael asked if the young woman was in attendance... And she ( apparently ) was: a 24-year-old woman came onstage and claimed her dad is, in fact, andy kaufman. \" he just wanted to be a stay-at-home dad, \" she said. \" that's why he wanted to leave the showbiz... He's just pretty much a great dad, and raised us. \" sure, the whole thing sounds like a kaufman-esque hoax, but one attendee wrote on facebook that it seemed \" as real as any reality that i've seen, \" though it was certainly \" a mindf ---. \" and a lifelong kaufman friend — who saw kaufman's body at his funeral — tells the hollywood reporter, \" this was not a prank. \" ( update: turns out, the \" daughter \" is an unrelated actress. )",

It was 1987, and he'd quit his day job five years prior. His writing career was going well, but his first \" flurry of public success \" brought along with it quite a few distractions; in nearly a year, he'd written just the opening chapter of a new novel. Though conventional wisdom dictates novelists should only write for about four hours at a stretch before \" diminishing returns set in, \" he and his wife decided that for four weeks, he \" would do nothing but write from 9am to 10: 30pm, \" six days a week, with three hours off per day for meals. No mail, no phone, no visitors, no cooking, no housework allowed. \" in this way, so we hoped, i'd not only complete more work quantitively, but reach a mental state in which my fictional world was more real to me than the actual one, \" he explains. He wrote freehand, and he didn't worry about details like the style, whether the plotline contradicted itself at times, or even whether the writing was any good. He just wanted to get the ideas flowing, and when the four weeks were over, the novel was basically done. ( he notes that before embarking on the four-week period, he'd done much of the research required for the book, and after, he took more time \" to write it all up properly. \" ) the full piece is worth a read. Meanwhile, in the present day, ishiguro weighed in on his nobel win: he told the bbc the honor is \" flabbergastingly flattering, \" but also added he was initially unsure what he was hearing was real: \" i thought that in this age of false news, it was perhaps a mistake. \"",

When it comes to the writing of novels, however, the consensus seems to be that after four hours or so of continuous writing, diminishing returns set in. I'd always more or less gone along with this view, but as the summer of 1987 approached i became convinced a drastic approach was needed. Lorna, my wife, agreed. Until that point, since giving up the day job five years earlier, i'd managed reasonably well to maintain a steady rhythm of work and productivity. But my first flurry of public success following my second novel had brought with it many distractions. Potentially career-enhancing proposals, dinner and party invitations, alluring foreign trips and mountains of mail had all but put an end to my \"proper \" work. I'd written an opening chapter to a new novel the previous summer, but now, almost a year later, i was no further forward. So lorna and i came up with a plan. I would, for a four-week period, ruthlessly clear my diary and go on what we somewhat mysteriously called a \"crash \". During the crash, i would do nothing but write from 9am to 10.30pm",

            "Many people have to work long hours. When it comes to the writing of novels, however, the consensus seems to be that after four hours or so of continuous writing, diminishing returns set in. I'd always more or less gone along with this view, but as the summer of 1987 approached i became convinced a drastic approach was needed. Lorna, my wife, agreed. Until that point, since giving up the day job five years earlier, i'd managed reasonably well to maintain a steady rhythm of work and productivity.

Potentially career-enhancing proposals, dinner and party invitations, alluring foreign trips and mountains of mail had all but put an end to my \"proper \" work. I'd written an opening chapter to a new novel the previous summer, but now, almost a year later, i was no further forward. So lorna and i came up with a plan. I would, for a four-week period, ruthlessly clear my diary and go on what we somewhat mysteriously called a \"crash \". During the crash, i would do nothing but write from 9am to 10.30pm",

Capitol police confirm that a \" gyro copter with a single occupant \" landed of the pilot's own accord — though most definitely without permission to fly in restricted airspace.

Rep. Mike mccaul, chair of the house homeland security panel, tells the ap that capitol police were ready to shoot him down if he'd gone much closer. \" he's not a suicide bomber, he's a patriot, \" a friend of hughes'tells the tampa newspaper. Hughes apparently hatched an idea about a year ago to deliver letters to every member of congress via his aircraft. \" as i have informed the authorities, i have no violent inclinations or intent, \" hughes wrote on his website, thedemocracyclub.org. \" an ultralight aircraft poses no major physical threat — it may present a political threat to graft.

        "summary": "In what's being called a supply \" red alert, \" a part of the colonial pipeline that transports gas from houston to new york — serving about 50 million people in 13 states daily, per cnn and the wall street journal — has been shut down since sept. 9, when a 250,000-gallon spill was discovered in a rural part of alabama. The pipeline's operator isn't sure what caused the leak, which reuters says is the biggest spill along the pipeline since 1996. The pipeline should resume full operation next week. Despite alternate methods of getting gas to the southeast and east coast, there will still be a shortage. \" you're going to see some places without gasoline, \" says tom kloza, an oil analyst with oil price information service. There are already gas-carrying ships lugging barrels from the gulf coast to new york, and kloza says more tanker trucks will probably be sent out as well. But any method other than a pipeline is usually more costly, so even if gas does make it to a particular east coast station, consumers will likely have to pay more at the pump, with those in georgia, alabama, tennessee, north carolina, and south carolina expected to be among the first to reach deeper into their wallets. Gas prices usually drop in the early fall as stations switch to winter-blend gas, but consumers in hard-hit states may now instead see an average hike of anywhere from 5 cents a gallon to 20 cents a gallon, fuel analysts estimate. Meanwhile, markets further north, at the end of the pipeline, may not be hit as hard because they can get their gas elsewhere, says kloza.",

The discovery by university of british columbia scientists has prompted a health advisory to inuit people in the region who eat the whale's meat. Researchers say it is an example of how the warming of the arctic is allowing the freer movement of pathogens. Icier conditions in the past acted as an obstruction to infectious agents. \"ice is a significant ecological barrier and it influences the way in which pathogens can be transmitted in nature and your risk of exposure, \" said molecular parasitologist michael grigg. \"what we're finding with the changes ongoing in the arctic is that we're getting new pathogens emerging to cause diseases in the region that haven't been there before, \" he told bbc news. The ubc marine mammal research unit scientist was speaking here at the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science ( aaas ). Toxoplasma gondii is ubiquitous at lower latitudes, and many people carry it with no ill effects. But it is a danger to pregnant women and individuals with weak immune systems.

        "summary": "The news about zika virus just got a bit worse: researchers in brazil have found that a more common mosquito than previously thought can carry the virus, which may hamper efforts to stop its spread. The primary transmitter of zika, which has been linked to birth defects and other maladies, is a species called aedes aegypti. Now, scientists in a lab have been able to infect the culex quinquefasciatus mosquito — a more prevalent species, the guardian reports. Whether or not culex quinquefasciatus, which is 20 times more common in brazil than the other species, can actually transmit the virus is still unclear. Scientists injected the mosquitoes with rabbit blood infected with zika. The virus made its way to the insects'salivary glands, which means transmission to humans may be possible. Zika has been linked to microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in abnormally small heads and brains. In brazil, more than 5,600 cases have been reported since october. Last month, it was reported that two of nine american women who had tested positive for zika have had abortions. Two of the women had miscarriages, and another birthed a child with microcephaly. The women had recently traveled to countries where the virus is rampant, according to reports. On thursday, health authorities in san francisco confirmed a case of the virus in a non-pregnant person, kron reports. Earlier in the week a pregnant woman in napa county, calif., was diagnosed with zika. Both had traveled to central america at some point.",

Rosalind arden says could have \" far-reaching implications for understanding human health and disease, \" scientists from the london school of economics and the university of edinburgh set out to understand the link between intelligence and health by studying … dogs. Per the independent, 68 border collies performed a series of cognitive tasks ( a \" dog iq \" test, if you will ), and scientists found not only did dogs who did well on one task tend to also have high performance on others, but that canines also develop dementia in a way similar to their two-legged owners — meaning study findings could potentially be applied to humans as well, notes phys.org. Scientists carrying out the study, published in the intelligence journal, had the dogs — whom a press release refers to as \" mensa mutts \" — tested on navigational skills, how quickly they could find hidden food, if they could gauge differences in food quantities, and how well they could follow a human pointing gesture. The dogs who performed above average on one test not only performed well on others — they also tended to complete the tests faster. \" just as people vary in their problem-solving abilities, so do dogs, even within one breed, \" arden says. \" this is significant because in humans there is a small but measureable tendency for people who are brighter to be healthier and live longer. \" which could eventually help figure out the true tie-in between intelligence and health, with so-called \" dognitive epidemiology \" perhaps even leading to treatments for dementia in humans. Why it may have been easier to conduct an intelligence test on dogs than on humans: researchers didn't have to control for \" confounding \" factors such as lifestyle choices ( e.g., smoking ) and socioeconomic status. Plus, \" dogs are excellent for this kind of work because they are willing to participate and seem to enjoy taking part, \" a university of edinburgh research fellow tells phys.org.

Nasa, however, apparently mistook it for another space bag with no trace of moon dust. It was eventually put up for auction and purchased by carlson in february 2015. She sent it to the johnson space center for testing, at which point nasa officials realized what had happened and refused to return it. A federal judge on friday ruled that was illegal, per collectspace, and carlson took possession of the bag on monday.

It \" could really use a different name, \" he writes, because lots of people still equate it with feeling a little blue and think sufferers simply need to buck up. \" i've said it before, and i ' ll say it again: dismissing the concerns of a genuine depression sufferer on the grounds that you've been miserable and got over it is like dismissing the issues faced by someone who's had to have their arm amputated because you once had a paper cut and it didn't bother you. \" at salon, joanna rothkopf sounds a similar theme. People don't realize that major depression is not only real, but it \" carries the heaviest burden of disability among mental and behavioral issues, \" she writes. People might dismiss it as a condition partly because the best diagnostic tool is a conversation, not an x-ray, writes lara salahi at boston.com. And yet it has physical manifestations: one reason depression is so debilitating is that it \" suppresses a key hormone that can damage neurons in the brain in areas critical to maintaining memory and reasoning, \" she writes. Hence, the difficulty for some to just \" snap out of it. \" as williams proved, depression \" can be masked by laughter, and — unlike hollywood — in some cases, there are no happy endings. \" ( click to read about williams'related battle with addiction. )",

        "summary": "The va's office of the medical inspector routinely dismisses the agency's deficiencies as harmless to patients ' health — even though that is patently and obviously untrue, according to a new report from the office of special counsel that turned up a host of disturbing new allegations against the va. According to the report, there are more than 50 pending whistleblower cases from veterans affairs employees, representing \" more than a quarter of all matters referred by osc for investigation government-wide, \" the report says, according to cnn. Specific allegations in the new report include:: one patient spent more than eight years in a brockton, mass., psychiatric facility before he even received a comprehensive evaluation or any medication assessments. Another veteran, admitted to the facility in 2005, didn't have a single note on his chart until seven years later. The omi viewed these as \" harmless errors. \" the medical center in jackson, miss., was found to have committed a host of infractions, including unlawfully prescribing narcotics, using unsterile medical equipment, and scheduling appointments in \" ghost clinics \" that had no actual providers, resulting in veterans not receiving treatment. The va has refused to acknowledge that these things affected veterans ' health or safety a fort collins, colo., facility would frequently cancel appointments, then reschedule them without consulting the patient. When the patient asked to reschedule, the appointment was marked as canceled at the patient's request. At the time of the report, almost 3,000 veterans were unable to reschedule appointments. Staff at the fort collins facility were also explicitly told to alter wait times to make them look shorter. Two employees were allegedly reassigned after refusing to \" zero out \" wait times. The omi said it could find no evidence that any of the colorado activities endangered patients ' health or safety. A pulmonologist at a montgomery, ala., facility tried to pass off notes from past providers as current readings for more than 1,200 patients. Omi once again couldn't say if this endangered patients. A whistleblower in grand junction, colo., said the facility's drinking water had elevated levels of legionella bacteria, and that standard maintenance procedures to fix that problem were never performed. Omi found no substantial danger to public health. The list goes on — you can read about them all in the osc's letter to president obama ( pdf here ). The va's acting secretary responded with a written statement saying he was \" deeply disappointed \" by both the allegations and \" the failures within va to take whistleblower complaints seriously, \" and promised to accept the osc's recommendations, the wall",

Justices will determine the validity of a 2008 law that has allowed the government to keep a closer eye on international communications, the new york times reports. Activists, lawyers, and journalists say the law has given the government license to stick its nose in their phone calls and emails. Officials argue that the plaintiffs haven't suffered damages that give them clear grounds to sue; a us appeals court disagreed. In other high court news: justices won't hear the case of a boston university student who was fined $ 675,000 for illegally downloading and sharing 30 songs, the ap reports. A federal judge called the fine unfairly large, but an appeals court approved it. Justices unanimously agreed that his parents ' immigration status couldn't protect a man from deportation for crimes. Carlos martinez gutierrez was brought to the us as a kid by his parents, who immigrated legally. The court also unanimously ruled that children conceived through artificial insemination after the biological father's death weren't entitled to government survivor benefits.",

        "summary": "It's probably not good for anyone to take a deep gulp of polluted air, but for pregnant women it could have a particularly significant effect — including maybe even upping the risk of having an autistic child, bloomberg reports. A harvard study published yesterday in environmental health perspectives says that women exposed to high levels of air pollution during their third trimester had about double the risk of giving birth to a child with autism. The research makes use of a study of more than 116,000 american nurses that began in 1989, along with the epa's air pollution data, nbc news reports. Of the 1,767 kids born to the nurses from 1990 to 2002, 245 of them were diagnosed with autism, bloomberg notes. The causes of autism remain a mystery for the most part, with scientists debating the roles that both genes and environmental factors play. \" there [ have ] to be gene and environmental interactions, \" the chairwoman of the lerner research institute's genomic medicine institute ( part of the cleveland clinic ) tells bloomberg. \" i suspect the fetus already had the weak autism spectrum disorder genes, and then the genes and the environment interacted. \" this study isn't the first one to make the pollution/autism link, but it's \" among the strongest studies to date, \" a director from advocacy group autism speaks tells nbc. Although it's hard to avoid pollution if you live near a big city or industrial factory — and fine particulates can drift hundreds of miles from their source, bloomberg notes — the study's authors recommend pregnant women stay away as much as possible from cities beset by pollution and not exercise outside near traffic-heavy areas.",

Vern miyagi says tests of the sirens ( listen here ) will join pre-existing tests of a steady siren tone beginning friday and continuing on the first business day of each month, report usa today and the washington post. Residents of the islands — who can learn more from public service announcements and community meetings — are also advised to store provisions that will last two weeks in case of a nuclear attack or natural disaster. Miyagi says it's important to plan for every possibility, even one that would give residents a 15-minute warning of a nuclear attack. Some residents tell abc news the siren could help them get to safety, while others say they would be sitting ducks regardless. Either way, the siren \" makes this threat even more real, \" as one woman puts it. Though north korean officials have referred to an attack on the us as \" inevitable, \" miyagi has attempted to calm fears by stressing that an attack remains unlikely. But he's competing with reports that north korea has continued to conduct missile engine and fuel tests in the aftermath of its last missile test on sept. 15, per the new york times. Radio signals detected by japan could also indicate a missile launch is being planned, reports reuters.",

North korea has not conducted a missile test since sept. 15. The hiatus has raised cautious hopes in the region that the country might want to de-escalate after a series of missile and nuclear tests earlier this year and instead focus on bracing its economy for the pain expected to result from fresh sanctions.

It was one of more than 130 rockets militants have launched into israel since the attack began, but the first to inflict casualties. Other developments in the burgeoning war: at least five civilians have been killed in israel's assault, but in an effort to reduce such casualties israel says it showered leaflets over gaza warning residents to stay away from hamas targets. For that matter, israel sent a warning to hamas as well: \" we recommend that no hamas operatives, whether low levels or senior leaders, show their faces above ground in the days ahead, \" the idf tweeted. But 400 angry mourners took to the streets anyway to bury hamas military chief ahmed jabari, the ap reports. \" god is great, \" they chanted. \" the revenge is coming. \" egyptian president mohamed morsi said his country stood by the palestinians, and against \" aggression that negatively affects the security and stability in the region. \" egypt's foreign minister spoke with hillary clinton, urging \" immediate us intervention \" before \" matters escalate out of control, \" the ap reports. Palestine has asked the un security council for help. In a closed-door meeting of the council, un observer riyad mansour said that \" war crimes are being perpetrated by israel against the palestinian people, \" and that \" the international community must act. \" but while susan rice expressed regret for the injury of civilians on both sides, she said the us \" strongly condemns \" palestine's almost daily barrage of rockets into israel, which \" does nothing but set back the palestinian cause. \" israel's attacks have already destroyed most of hamas'stockpile of fajr rockets, which could reduce the risk of escalation, nbc news reports. With a range of 47 miles, the rockets threatened tel aviv and other central israeli cities. If one hit tel aviv, israel would surely respond with ground troops. Israel, meanwhile, declared a state of emergency for people closer to the conflict; schools were closed within 25 miles of the border, and residents were warned to stay within a hundred yards of bomb shelters. \" people won't be outside, \" a resident of sderot said.",

Obama emphasized that he plans to act on his own when necessary, reports the new york times. ( he \" declared independence from congress, \" says the story. ) politico and the hill also emphasize this angle in their coverage. The full text is out, via the washington post. A sampling: obama said he will \" direct the treasury to create a new way for working americans to start their own retirement savings: myra. \" he calls it \" a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg, \" and one that guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in. \" details will be fleshed out tomorrow. The economy is growing, he says, \" and those at the top have never done better. But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many americans are working more than ever just to get by — let alone get ahead. And too many still aren't working at all. \" \" what i offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class. \" he said he ' ll work with congress but will use executive action when he sees fit. ( as with his plan to raise the minimum wage of federal contract workers. ) \" today, women make up about half our workforce. But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an embarrassment. A woman deserves equal pay for equal work.... It's time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a mad men episode. \" he defended obamacare, saying that \" more than nine million americans have signed up for private health insurance or medicaid coverage. \" he also pleaded with republicans to resist the urge for \" another 40 \" futile votes to repeal it. Army ranger cory remsburg got a long standing ovation when introduced by the president.

Subsequently, 21 people had to be preemptively treated for rabies exposure. Per the greeley tribune, 20 of those treated were potentially exposed after visiting the woman's home hoping to catch a glimpse of the baby animal.

The positive result meant the woman, and all 20 of her friends who were eager to see the baby raccoon, had to be treated.

Moscow ( reuters ) - russia could speed up delivery of anti-aircraft missiles to syria if the west intervenes, but also floated the idea of suspending the shipment, russian media reported on friday, as moscow set out its negotiating position ahead of peace talks. A russian arms industry source was quoted by interfax news agency as threatening to hasten delivery of the hotly-contested s-300 missiles if the west were to impose a no-fly zone or israel were to launch new air strikes. However the source also \" did not exclude that the delivery of the s-300 to syria could be frozen for a period of time \" interfax reported, comparing the move to the delivery of another weapons system that was suspended by moscow. Russia's arms industry is firmly controlled by the state, and it is unlikely the unidentified source would be authorized to speak without the blessing of the kremlin. Russia and the west are staking out positions with parallel threats to arm the warring sides ahead of a peace conference next month, the first attempt in a year by the global powers on either side in syria's civil war to look for a way to end it.

        "summary": "The man accused of driving his car into counter-protesters in charlottesville on saturday, killing 32-year-old heather heyer, threatened his disabled mother on more than one occasion, according to police records seen by usa today. Records show that police were called to the kentucky home 20-year-old james alex fields jr. Shared with his 49-year-old mother, samantha bloom, nine times between november 2010 and february 2013. On one occasion, dispatchers said the mother was in a wheelchair and was very frightened by her son's threatening behavior. In a 2010 call, the mother said her son had smacked her in the head and put his hands over her mouth after she asked him to stop playing video games. She was \" not assaulted tonight but he is being very threatening toward her, \" an incident report from 2011 reads. \" the mother is in a wheelchair and doesn't feel in control of the situation and is scared. \" records state that on other occasions, fields brandished a 12-inch knife and spat in his mother's face. Bloom has told reporters that fields moved out after they moved from florence, ky., to maumee, ohio, but he left his cat with her before he went to virginia. In other developments: the cincinnati enquirer reports that there were troubling events in fields ' family going back to before he was born. In 1996, five months before he was born, his father died in a car crash. The driver of the vehicle he was in was charged with murder after leaving the scene to go back to a bar. In 1984, when mother samantha bloom was 16, her father killed her mother and then himself. Alt-right leader richard spencer refused to condemn fields ' actions monday, the washington post reports. \" this man could have lost control because he felt in danger and slammed on the accelerator and unintentionally killed someone, \" he said. Spencer, who said his group will return to charlottesville, slammed president trump's condemnation of white supremacists as \" kumbaya nonsense. \" a charlottesville judge denied fields bond monday on charges including second-degree murder. The judge named local attorney charles weber to represent fields after the court was told that the suspect made $ 650 every two weeks for security company securitas and couldn't afford a lawyer, cnn reports. Securitas says fields has been fired. A former classmate tells the ap that on a school trip to europe in 2015, he clashed with fields after fields said he hated the french and was only on the trip to visit the german \" fatherland. \" \" he just really laid on about the french being lower than us and inferior to us,",

        "summary": "Britain and the rest of the united kingdom are supposed to exit the european union in 2019, but the current round of brexit talks is getting hung up on a geographic snag: how to create a border between ireland and the uk. The times of london reports that ireland wants the post-brexit border to be the irish sea, which separates the land mass of britain, wales, and scotland from the land mass of ireland. Simple enough. The problem is that there's one more component of the uk, that being northern ireland, which, for brexit purposes, is located inconveniently within ireland's land mass. As sky news points out, once brexit takes effect, this will be the only land border between the uk and the rest of europe. ( see this map. ) british prime minister theresa may's idea is to create a high-tech \" soft border \" between northern ireland and the republic of ireland, using video surveillance and the like. But irish prime minister leo varadkar doesn't think it's workable and might inflame old tensions between northern ireland and his republic. He instead wants the border to be drawn at the sea, with customs checks moved to ports, per the telegraph. An official from northern ireland calls that \" absurd \" because it would put a border between northern ireland and the rest of the uk. Ireland's foreign minister similarly dug in: \" what we do not want to pretend is that we can solve the problems of the border... Through technical solutions like cameras and pre-registration and so on, \" says simon coveney. \" that is not going to work. \" as of now, no solution is in sight.",

While china hasn't fully outlined what it will do, \"i think they have indicated that they're going to suspend or cancel or postpone a series of … military-to-military engagements, \" a state department official said in a transcript on the department's site. China responded to requests for comment by saying that \"the wrong actions by the us in the taiwan strait will inevitably harm us-china relations, \" including military exchanges. But analysts expect it to stop short of fully severing military ties with the us. The blow to relations comes even as tensions are rising between the us and nominal ally pakistan. Why do we bring this up? because pakistan made a point of praising china today as its \"all-weather friend, \" according to reuters.",

            "Islamabad pakistan warned the united states on tuesday to stop accusing it of playing a double game with islamist militants and heaped praise on \" all-weather friend \" china. Prime minister yusuf raza gilani, speaking exclusively to reuters, said any unilateral military action by the united states to hunt down militants of the haqqani network inside pakistan would be a violation of his country's sovereignty. However, he side-stepped questions on the tense relations with the united states and offered no indications of any steps pakistan might take to soothe the fury in washington. The outgoing chairman of the u.s. Military's joint chiefs of staff, admiral mike mullen, last week described the haqqani network, the most violent faction among taliban militants in afghanistan, as a \" veritable arm \" of pakistan's isi spy agency and accused islamabad of providing support for the group's september 13 attack on the u.s. Embassy in kabul. \" the negative messaging, naturally that is disturbing my people, \" gilani said in the interview from his office in islamabad. \" if there is messaging that is not appropriate to our friendship, then naturally it is extremely difficult to convince my public. Therefore they should be sending positive messages. \" since mullen's comments, pakistan has launched a diplomatic counter-attack and attempted to drum up support from its strongest ally in the region, china. Pakistani officials have been heaping praise on china since its public security minister arrived in islamabad on monday for high-level talks. \" we are true friends and we count on each other, \" gilani said in separate comments broadcast on television networks after talks with meng jianzhu on tuesday. The military, pakistan's most powerful institution, said it appreciated beijing's backing. Army chief general ashfaq kayani thanked meng for china's \" unwavering support. \" ' all-weather friends ' china and pakistan call each other \" all-weather friends \" and their close ties have been underpinned by long-standing wariness of their common neighbor, india, and a desire to hedge against u.s. Influence across the region. \" they ( the pakistanis ) are trying to use their diplomatic options as much as possible to defuse pressure on them. They hope china will help them in this crisis, \" said security analyst hasan askari rizvi.
