Singer ted nugent, who has been slammed himself for diatribes against barack obama and who has visited the current white house as a guest of president trump, phoned into fox news on friday to play down comparisons between himself and griffin for inflammatory comments he made in the past about obama, mediaite reports. In his call to fox news specialists, nugent clarified a 2012 statement he'd made that he'd be \" dead or in jail \" if then-president obama won reelection and one in 2007 in which he said obama could \" suck on my machine gun. \" \" i did not threaten anybody's life, \" he insisted to the fox news crew, backing up what he'd said on conservative radio host ben ferguson's show on wednesday, when he noted, \" to compare what i said... We're talking apples and grenades here, \" per the hill. The \" dead or in jail \" quote was simply an expression of his fear of big government, he told fox, while the machine gun statement was an \" outrageous metaphor \" on gun control. \" i did nothing to harm anyone, \" he said. \" [ griffin ] came out with symbolism that was truly vile. \" he did concede to ferguson he'd \" recommended \" hillary clinton be hanged for her \" certainly treasonous \" actions concerning benghazi, media matters notes.

        "summary": "The weird new fight regarding the senate gop's health care plan is one of semantics. Democrats insist that republicans are slashing medicaid, while republicans say that medicaid is actually increasing. Witness president trump's tweet on wednesday: \" democrats purposely misstated medicaid funding under new senate bill - actually goes up, \" he wrote. Kellyanne conway and newt gingrich have made a similar case. So who is right? in the wonky world of budget parlance, both sides can make a case. Explanations: he's right, but...: \" in a literal sense, \" trump is correct, explains a wonkblog post at the washington post. Under the gop plan, the total amount spent on medicaid would grow, slowly, from 2017 to 2026. \" but the accounting he uses to show medicaid spending is wildly divergent from the way budget analysts, policymakers and many lawmakers account for spending levels. \" it's all about what is considered \" baseline. \" the numbers: the cbo says that under current law, the federal government would spend $ 4.62 trillion on medicaid through 2026. Under the senate bill, spending would be $ 770 billion less. \" opponents of the gop bills call that a cut, \" says the fact-checking blog politifact. \" the cbo calls that'reductions in outlays. ' gingrich is saying it's an increase. \" after a lengthy assessment, the site rates gingrich's claim \" half true. \" it previously gave conway a \" mostly false \" rating. Reductions vs. Cuts: the cbo projections \" take into account policies that would be changed by the bill, as well as factors such as how much the population is expected to grow and age, and how quickly medical costs are rising, \" notes usa today. \" democrats argue that the senate plan should be compared to current law — and that reductions in planned spending amount to cuts. \" one analogy: a story at fox news calls attention to this tweet by former white house press chief ari fleischer: \" your salary today is $ 50k. Your boss promises it will be $ 100k in 10 years. Instead, u get $ 75k. Did you get a $ 25k raise or a $ 25k cut? \" fewer enrollees: abc news explains one reason why medicaid costs would be lower under the gop plan: \" medicaid would see 15 million fewer enrollees over the next decade, the cbo said. Enrollment would decline from two groups — people who are currently eligible for medicaid and people who, under the aca, would be eligible in the future as more states continue to expand medicaid.",

Now the uk is scrambling to retrieve roughly 20,000 citizens from the sinai peninsula — a plan that reuters says has been \" thrown into chaos \" by logistical holdups. The easyjet airline says egypt has prevented at least seven of its rescue planes from landing in sharm el-sheikh, though two flights have been allowed out, the bbc reports. \" the situation for uk flights in sharm el-sheik remains fluid, \" easyjet said in a statement, adding it was working with the british government \" at the highest level \" to resolve the situation, per reuters. Four other airlines that make direct flights between the locations report their planes should be able to come and go just fine, reuters and the bbc note. Meanwhile, president obama made remarks thursday that were somewhat in line with britain's thoughts on the plane crash. \" i think there is a possibility that there was a bomb on board, and we're taking that very seriously, \" he said in a kiro radio interview, per npr. Egypt and russia note they haven't been given any intelligence involving a bomb from either the us or britain, cnn reports. \" i don't reject any conclusion.

Npr reports on the utah republican's push to undo the bears ears national monument created by barack obama during his last days in office. It was a highly controversial move that bans new development ( think oil, cattle grazing ) across its 1.3 million acres. The bears ears inter-tribal coalition pushed obama to use the power granted to him under the 1906 antiquities act to make the land a national monument, and the president did exactly that. Bishop wants trump to strike the move, or reduce bears ears'scope. But as npr reports, undoing a national monument so big wouldn't just be unprecedented — it's also unclear if trump can do it. The act gives congress alone the power to undo a designation, giving presidents just to power to designate. \" legally, it's untested, \" said interior secretary nominee ryan zinke during his senate confirmation hearing. Bishop isn't the only one asking, though: on friday utah governor gary herbert signed house concurrent resolution 11, which asks trump to undo the monument. Fox13 relays some hearsay: herbert says he heard trump could make a move on the monument this coming week.

( associated press ) philadelphia ( ap ) — bill cosby has performed in public for the first time since a sex abuse scandal embroiled him in 2015, telling stories and honoring old friends in his hometown on monday as a retrial looms in his criminal sexual assault case. The 80-year-old entertainer took the stage monday night at a philadelphia jazz club for his first show since may 2015. His last comedy tour ended amid protests as about 60 women were coming forward to accuse him of drugging and molesting them over five decades, something he has denied. Cosby arrived at the club on the arm of his spokesman andrew wyatt. He wore a gray hoodie printed with the phrase \" hello friend, \" something his late son, ennis cosby, often would say. Cosby is scheduled for an april 2 retrial on charges he drugged and molested a woman at his suburban philadelphia home in 2004. He has pleaded not guilty and remains free on bail. His first trial ended with a hung jury last year. Jury selection for his retrial will start march 29. Cosby's spokesman notified reporters of the comedy performance about two hours before he was to take the stage at the larose jazz club. The show was part of a program honoring jazz musician tony williams. The performance is cosby's latest step back into the spotlight he's mostly shied from since his december 2015 arrest",

        "summary": "Want to quit smoking or alleviate depression? in a few years you might be taking the psychedelic \" magic \" in magic mushrooms — if the fda ever agrees, the new york times reports. Researchers from john hopkins university suggest the fda should reclassify psilocybin — the psychedelic drug in hallucinogenic mushrooms — to a schedule iv drug, meaning it can serve a medical use and isn't likely to trigger addiction or abuse. It would be like sleeping pills, but not a simple prescription: \" we believe that the conditions should be tightly controlled and that when taken for a clinical reason, it should be administered in a health care setting \" under professional guidance, study co-author matthew johnson tells fortune. Published in neuropharmacology, the study looks at psilocybin data going back to the 1940s. \" in the 1960s, they were on the cutting edge of neuroscience research and understanding how the brain worked, \" says johnson. \" but then it got out of the lab. \" research stopped partly because the hippie counterculture embraced mind-altering drugs like mushrooms and lsd, but a recent cultural shift has seen professionals adopt \" microdosing \" to increase productivity, and consumers — particularly women — use psychedelics to alleviate anxiety and depression. And while psilocybin poses some health risks, johnson says in a press release it's safer than other surveyed drugs. But don't hold your breath: fda approval could take more than five years.",

You can expect hillary clinton, bernie sanders, martin o ' malley, jim webb, and lincoln chafee on stage, with joe biden still a wild card. Some related developments: biden's lectern: cnn isn't just figuratively holding a spot for the vice president if decides to join the debate — it has a sixth lectern set aside. Right now, however, most analysts don't expect biden to participate, reports the hill. The wild card: if one emerges, it's likely to be webb, according to the washington post. The former virginia senator has \" idiosyncratic \" views that don't fit the usual mold. He's to the left on some things ( an early opponent of the iraq war ) and to the right on others ( the confederate flag issue is \" complicated, \" he says ). Sanders: his challenge will be to come off as a plausible candidate for the general election, not just a darling of progressives in the primary. \" it's one thing to be a prophet in the wilderness, \" a political scientist tells usa today. \" it's another to be presidential. That's sanders ' challenge. \" clinton: a new national poll has her in front at 46 %, ahead of sanders at 27 % and biden at 16 %, reports cbs news. If biden doesn't run, her lead over sanders only widens. As a result, she's not expected to attack her opponents aggressively but to focus on laying out her own message.",

Police say their mother, elaine yates, took kimberly and kelly yates from rhode island in 1985 amid a custody dispute when they were 3 years old and 10 months old, respectively. Acting on an anonymous tip, police located the trio in the houston area. Elaine yates was arrested monday and is facing child-snatching charges, wcvb reports. The girls ' father, russell yates, says he's not interested in seeing her prosecuted because \" that ain't gonna help her, me, or anybody else at this point, \" but says he hopes to see his daughters soon. Heavy and the providence journal have background on the complicated case: three weeks prior to her disappearance, elaine yates reportedly found her husband with another woman on the family boat. He later acknowledged hitting elaine during a fight about the incident, though he said she attacked him first. Russell yates was awarded custody when elaine failed to appear at the custody hearing held months after her disappearance with the children. The year after their disappearance, russell yates sued elaine's mother, believing she knew where they were; the woman ultimately did not give up any information and spent eight days in jail as a result. Russell and elaine yates were formally divorced in 1996. The journal recently re-posted an extensive 1988 article on the case. ( a man abandoned as a newborn found his family after 39 years. )",

Reporter adam entous writes that trump last year considered taking the unprecedented step of revoking former president obama's security clearance as friction between the current and past administrations escalated. Trump, however, says he never even considered such a move. In the story, entous writes that \" some of the new president's advisers \" — nobody is named — suggested that obama be denied the access to intel briefings that all former presidents have. Others in trump's circle disagreed — especially then-national security adviser hr mcmaster — and trump sided with mcmaster's camp, according to the article. Not so, says the president. \" fake news, of which there is soooo much ( this time the very tired new yorker ) falsely reported that i was going to take the extraordinary step of denying intelligence briefings to president obama, \" he tweeted tuesday morning. \" never discussed or thought of! \" trump also took note of former national intelligence director james clapper's statement over the weekend that brennan's anti-trump \" rhetoric \" has \" become an issue in and of itself. \" in another tuesday tweet, trump wrote: \" even james clapper has admonished john brennan for having gone totally off the rails.

            "Just before noon on january 20, 2017, john brennan, the outgoing c.i.a. Director, drove to the home of a former colleague to watch donald trump take the oath of office. President obama's most trusted intelligence advisers had come together as spectators for the first time after eight years in government. No group had access to more u.s. Secrets about the role that the russians played in the 2016 election and their mysterious contacts with the trump campaign, fuelling their collective concerns about trump becoming president. As trump delivered his inaugural address, the mood at the viewing party darkened to \"one of great worry, \" one participant recalled. Brennan found the president's message \"disgraceful, \" a view that he thought, as a career intelligence professional, he would keep to himself. The next day, trump delivered a campaign-style speech at c.i.a. Headquarters in langley, virginia, and brennan's phone lit up with text messages and e-mails from former agency colleagues who, like him, were outraged. After going to the gym to burn off steam, brennan drafted a statement decrying trump's \"despicable display of self-aggrandizement, \" which nick shapiro, his former deputy chief of staff at the c.i.a., e-mailed to news organizations. Brennan had told shapiro that he intended to spend his time working with the universities that he attended as a young man and wanted to avoid becoming a focus of attention. But trump has a way of forcing people to think about which side they are on and what they are prepared to do about it. To be sure, intelligence officers have political and policy views of their own. But they are instructed and trained from their first day of joining the c.i.a. Not to let those views affect their intelligence work. Michael morell, who served as acting c.i.a. Director after a long career as an analyst at the agency, said that he liked to tell new recruits, \"leave your political views in your car in the parking lot. Don't bring them in the building. \" while the u.s. Military's culture discourages officers from expressing political views in public after they retire, \"there is no similar ethos in the intelligence community, there is no instruction book \" for former intelligence professionals, morell told me, \"so you're left to figure it out on your own. \" brennan worked in the obama administration for eight years, as a top white house counterterrorism adviser",

        "summary": "Rupert sanders ' live-action ghost in the shell — a remake of the japanese animated film of the same name, based on manga — follows a cyborg named major. Tasked with beating up terrorists for a government task force, she slowly begins to uncover her true identity. Here's what critics are saying: \" fans of the comics should appreciate how faithful this remains to the original plot, \" writes edward douglas at the new york daily news. \" a few sequences are recreated masterfully, and some fresh strokes fill the gaps and enhance the original animated story. \" but though scarlett johansson's major \" is suitably robotic, \" the scenes in which she's not beating someone up are pretty dull, douglas writes. Justin chang credits johansson on \" a near-perfect piece of acting. \" but he can't help but notice the film's \" half-apologetic, half-defensive pose, \" perhaps its reaction to criticism over the casting of a white actress to play a traditionally japanese character. That said, the film does have \" an emotional surge that its 1995 predecessor lacked \" along with \" staggering \" visuals, he writes at the los angeles times. \" your senses will be deeply and thoroughly ravished. \" barry hertz is on the same page regarding johansson. She \" does a better job than anyone could reasonably hope, \" he writes at the globe and mail. It's just too bad she's \" trapped in sanders'soulless production. \" it's \" a product born out of a desire to erase virtually any trace of its foreign origins \" and \" an inert, insulting appropriation of what is one of the 20th century's most influential works of pop art, \" he writes. As brian truitt puts it, \" the interface might be cool, but the inner workings just don't compute. \" not only \" a minefield of political incorrectness, \" the film is also \" a defective mess with lifeless characters, \" he writes at usa today. And though it raises interesting themes \" of identity, amorality and what makes for a life worth living, \" it \" too often reverts to unsatisfying action set pieces before digging too deep. \" ( some have complained about the film's \" whitewashing. \" )",

Witness accounts say that the teen walked up to the table with the five victims, pulled a gun from his pocket, and began shooting. It remains unclear why, but most stories quote students who say he was distraught after breaking up with a girl. One tells the seattle post-intelligencer that he had recently gotten into a fight with another boy over a girl. \" he was very upset about that, \" she says.

And if you and i don't do this, then you and i may well spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it once was like in america when men were free. \" — ronald reagan, march 30, 1961 president reagan's words, spoken 52 years ago this weekend, still ring true, with one modification. If we don't defend our freedoms now against the onslaught of president obama's policies, we won't have to wait until our sunset years for american freedom to be a distant memory. These days washington careens from crisis to crisis, most of them manufactured.

            "Photo: alex c. Glenn/upi/landov liz cheney's op-ed in today's wall street journal is an important and alarming document. She is not a marginal figure — she served as deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs in the bush administration. More important, she is a very close ally of her father's and the two have exhibited every sign of sharing a worldview in essentially every particular, which suggests that something very much like her brain held, depending on your point of view, either the second most powerful or the most powerful job in american politics for eight years. And she ( and thus, by extension, her father ) is obviously stark raving mad. Even after four years of bug-eyed right-wing paranoia, cheney's op-ed stands out for its utter dearth of the slightest whiff of perspective or factual grounding. President obama, she tells us, \"is the most radical man ever to occupy the oval office. \" he has \"launched a war on americans'second amendment rights. \" he does not want the economy to grow. ( \"he believes in greater redistribution of a much smaller pie. \" ) obama \"seems unaware that the free-enterprise system has lifted more people out of poverty than any other economic system devised by man \" — which is odd, because obama is always saying things like \"business,"

        "summary": "Not one, but three new studies emerged this week in a scientific journal seeking to explain the still-puzzling internet phenomenon that is the dress. \" there will be dozens and dozens of papers about it over the years. This is just the beginning, \" wellesley professor bevil conway tells the los angeles times. The pieces in current biology are united in the idea that we all see the dress differently because we make different assumptions about the color of the light illuminating it, the la times reports. \" you have in your head an internal model of what the colors of the world are, and that helps you resolve ambiguities, \" conway notes. Your brain isn't getting enough information from the bad picture of the dress that was circulating, he tells the new york times, \" so the brain has to turn to the internal model and say, 'hey, guru, what do you think is going on out there? ' \" also among the findings: brains that think the dress is being colored by a blue sky will ignore blue; the dress, for them, is white and gold. But if we're perceiving the dress as being lit by an orange incandescent bulb, it's a blue and black dress that we see ( which is correct, given normal lighting, the la times reminds us ). Overall, a study finds, 57 % of people see blue and black, 30 % see white and gold, and 11 % see blue and brown, according to a poll of 1,400 people ( 2 % see other colors ). Women and elderly people have higher odds of seeing a white and gold outfit, while men and younger folks tend to see the actual colors of blue and black, according to the same study, led by conway. Researchers theorize that could be because women and older people are awake more in the daytime, so they have more of a tendency to assume a blue sky is affecting their perceptions. There's also the possibility that bluish shadows are coming into play, notes a study led by michael webster of the university of nevada, reno. That gets us into the habit of ignoring the color blue. In fact, when researchers replaced the blue with yellow, people stopped disagreeing about the color, with most clearly seeing the yellow: \" when you see a bluish tint you attribute it to the light, and when you see a yellowish tint you attribute it to the object, \" webster says. That study found participants were evenly divided in seeing white and gold or blue and black, the new york times reports. As for that frustrating",

        "summary": "Bump stocks can turn a semiautomatic weapon into a firearm that shoots at nearly the speed of a machine gun, and a \" machine gun \" is what the devices will be considered going forward. Npr reports the trump administration on tuesday announced a ban on the attachments, a move facilitated by the devices'reclassification as \" machine guns \" — they ' ll then be covered by the federal law that prohibits the guns. It ' ll take about 90 days for the regulation to go into effect, and it doesn't just impact the sale of new devices: those who possess the attachment — tens of thousands are estimated to exist — will need to destroy them or hand them over to the atf before the 90 days are through. The move is the culmination of president trump's march announcement that the devices would be banned; 14 of them were infamously attached to weapons found in the hotel room from which stephen paddock unleashed the october 2017 las vegas massacre. The wall street journal reports the justice department says the redefinition has passed a legal review that attorneys with the atf participated in — notably, as the atf in 2010 determined bump stocks weren't machine guns. The doj says it is ready to fight any legal challenges that may arise, and they almost certainly will. The ap reports gun owners of america vowed to file a suit. The washington examiner's take is that the move is the right one, but not one that will really impact future mass shootings, as the devices reduce a gun's accuracy. The las vegas shooting was a special case due to the shooter's distance ( 1,200 feet ) and angle ( shooting from above ).",

        "summary": "Apparently fannie mae and freddie mac feel enough time has passed since the subprime mortgage crisis: the government-supported mortgage guarantors say they ' ll back mortgages with as little as a 3 % down payment, cnn money reports. Both agencies hope to encourage first-time homebuyers who may be having a hard time raising the current 5 % minimum or the more traditional 20 % down payment to pony up for a place through their programs, the ap reports. Fannie mae will start backing the fixed-rate loans, which will apply to first-time buyers and refinances, on dec. 13, with freddie mac following suit by march 23. There's a high borrowing bar, though: buyers must purchase private mortgage insurance, or pmi; boast a credit score of at least 620; be willing to provide documentation for all income, assets, and jobs; and attend home ownership counseling sessions. The mortgage insurance industry and supporters of low-income families are most pleased with the government initiative, especially since recent data from the national association of realtors shows that only 29 % of home purchasers are first-time buyers — significantly below the historical 40 % rate, the new york times reports. But others are wary that the programs may again open the financial floodgates to another crisis by leaving borrowers without an ample cash cushion vulnerable to default. A cato institute economist tells the times that \" you're essentially underwater when you walk away from the table \" after closing costs and that this \" is not a situation we should be trying to get people in. \" still other experts think the programs might not make much of a difference anyway, since rigid borrowing criteria and lack of demand are bigger issues than not being able to fork over a down payment.",

The infant recovered, but police say the child \" appeared to be in a great deal of stress \" after spending 40 minutes in the locked car on a day when the temperature was near 90, reports nj.com. After the baby's mother returned to the car, with two children in tow, police charged her with endangering the welfare of a child. She was released pending a court appearance, and the baby was released into the custody of the father. \" i recognize the civilians who took immediate action to rescue this child, for they truly saved a life, \" says the police chief.",

        "summary": "The details surrounding the shooting of ibragim todashev, friend of boston bombing suspect tamerlan tsarnaev, continue to be tweaked: though officials said yesterday that todashev was unarmed when he was shot, today a slightly different version of the story is emerging: the new york times reports that todashev first knocked an fbi agent to the ground by tossing a table at him, then ran at him with a metal pole ( possibly a broomstick ) before being shot and killed. The times cites a senior law enforcement official, and calls his account of the incident \" the most detailed to date. \" citing a government official, usa today reports that todashev overturned the table, pushed the agent into a wall, and came at him with a pole. In this telling, the metal pole was \" about the size of a broom handle. \" cbs boston has basically the same story, citing multiple law enforcement officials. Cbs boston adds the interesting detail that todashev reportedly flipped the table as the agent looked down to read a text. It was apparently a message from the state trooper who was also in the room; he thought todashev was growing agitated, and wanted to mention that to the agent without todashev's knowledge. All three accounts agree that todashev ran at the agent again after the first few shots were fired, prompting the agent to shoot again, and that the agent required stitches for his injuries. Meanwhile, todashev's father abdulbaki publicized pictures ( which have not been authenticated ) of his son's dead body, said to have been taken by a friend, and accused the fbi of an \" execution-style \" killing, the ap reports. He claims todashev had six gunshot wounds to his torso and one to the back of his head. He maintains his son was \" 100 % unarmed, \" and says he was \" tortured. \" his theory: \" maybe my son knew something, some information the police did not want to be made public.

The missile test took place during 10 days of naval exercises near the straits of hormuz, which iran recently threatened to close if met with sanctions from the west on its oil exports. Tehran had promised to develop its own long-range surface-to-air missiles after a deal to buy them from russia fell through last year. Today's announcement is likely designed to show that progress is being made, the guardian reports; iran wants the missiles to deter against an attack from the us or israel against its nuclear program. Development of a fuel rod is a feat many in the west believed iran wasn't capable of pulling off, reports the wall street journal. Ironically, sanctions against the nation may have sped the development of the rod, which is necessary for a nuclear reactor. Because iran could not purchase rods, the country was forced to develop one locally. Click for more on the new nuclear fuel rods.",

Prosecutors allege that wasila tasi ' u, who comes from a poor, rural family in the north of the country, laced her husband umar sani's food with poison - perhaps because she regretted the marriage in april. She is also accused of the murder of three other people, who are said to have died suddenly after eating the same meal prepared for a post-wedding celebration in the village of unguwar yansoro. But the trial has angered activists who claim a girl who married a man more than 20 years her senior should be treated as a victim. The case was opened yesterday with testimony from a seven-year-old child who says she was given money and sent to buy the poison on the same day sani died. Prosecutor lamido abba soron-dinki's first witness was a girl identified as hamziyya, who was living in the same house as tasi ' u and her husband at the time. Hamziyya was identified as the sister of sani's ' co-wife ', referring to a woman the deceased farmer had married previously in a region where polygamy is widespread.

        "summary": "We may like to think that we are indescribably complex emotional creatures, but computer scientists at brigham young university are finding that they can accurately predict one side of ourselves — our dark, angry side — simply by tracking the way we move a mouse while on a computer. \" using this technology, websites will no longer be dumb, \" lead researcher jeffrey jenkins says. \" websites can go beyond just presenting information, but they can sense you. They can understand not just what you're providing, but what you're feeling. \" reporting in the journal mis quarterly, the researchers say this ability could enable web developers to, say, fix the parts of web experiences that consistently frustrate the masses. To test this, jenkins and colleagues engaged dozens of computer users in three experiments, reports ars technica. First, they randomly antagonized 65 mechanical turk users and monitored their cursors; the more frustrated users moved their cursors more sporadically and, counterintuitively, more slowly. Next they randomly annoyed 126 different participants on a mock e-commerce site and found that they spotted the frustrated users with 82 % accuracy. Finally, they asked 80 participants to report their emotions while using an online tool, and this is where they were able to gauge the level of negative emotion, too. Jenkins has already patented the tech, and is working on extending it to touchscreens. Fine, so long as it's not used \" for evil things like an orwellian dystopian future where our every emotional whim is monitored by the government, or advertisers, \" warns the daily dot.

Per the ap, a justice department filing indicates prosecutors are admitting they may have been wrong about the assertion that butina peddled sex in exchange for a job or influence. The filing says the mistake boils down to a literal misinterpretation of text messages sent to and from butina, though \" even granting that the government's understanding of this particular text conversation was mistaken, \" there is enough other evidence to keep butina in custody. While russian foreign minister sergey lavrov has called the accusations against butina false and pressed the state department to release her to russia immediately, the recent filing says the 29-year-old remains a suspect and a flight risk who may not be granted bond. Per the guardian, a lawyer for butina recently slammed federal prosecutors over the sexual allegations he characterized as a sexist smear. \" the impact of this inflammatory allegation, which painted ms. Butina as some type of kremlin-trained seductress, or spy-novel honeypot character, trading sex for access and power, cannot be overstated, \" the attorney, robert driscoll, wrote in a filing. Driscoll has denied his client is a russian agent and butina has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and to acting as an unregistered foreign agent.",

It is, of course, when measured as distance above sea level. But define tallest as the point on the planet closest to space, and ecuador's 20,702-foot mount chimborazo takes the top slot, with everest banished from the top 20. Chimborazo's peak sits 3,967 miles from the center of the earth, while everest is a full two miles shy of that. Chimborazo's nearness to the equator is why: though the earth is a sphere, it's not a perfect one, and it \" bulges slightly around its waistline, \" per the times, giving the andean peak an advantage that the himalayas, thousand of miles north of the equator, don't enjoy. Jeopardy master ken jennings shared some trivia about chimborazo with conde nast traveler in 2012. He, too, pointed out the inactive volcano's supremacy over everest, but noted that when it comes to sheer elevation, some three dozen mountains are taller than it in south america. Jennings notes that one could also argue that neither everest nor chimborazo take the cake: hawaii's own mauna kea rises 33,478 feet from its base, but much of that base is under the sea. As for chimborazo's reputation, the times sees it as a vastly easier mountain to climb than everest, with the whole process taking roughly two weeks to everest's eight. That said, at the guardian, amateur climber kevin rushby recounts his struggle to summit chimborazo — he hallucinated green rabbits when he reached the top.",

The prince is inviting dubai's biggest real estate developer emaar properties, chaired by mohammed alabbar, to team up with his investment firm kingdom holding on the project. \" right now we are discussing and evaluating the possibility of building a one-mile ( 1.6-kilometre ) tower, \" alwaleed told reuters by telephone late on monday. \" we also need good partners. I invite emaar and mr. Alabbar to join forces with us and see how we can build the ultimate one-mile tower somewhere in the world. \" alwaleed did not say how the project would be financed if it went ahead, or when it might be completed. He said the cost had yet to be decided. But his ambition reflects the growing confidence of many gulf companies as they expand overseas, aided by booming economies and rising asset prices in their home countries. \" i am now inviting the major cities of the world like shanghai, moscow"

        "summary": "Where are men and women ok with being touched? perhaps not surprisingly, it has everything to do with who is doing the touching, report researchers at oxford university this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. A handy body map — 1,368 men and women were asked to color in areas of the body where touching from a particular type of person was ok, and the map resulted from their answers — accompanying their study paints a pretty clear picture: for instance, most men and women are perfectly fine being touched anywhere by romantic partners, and almost every body part is off limits when it comes to strangers, while women are more comfortable being touched by others in general than men. But how do we feel for all those people who fall in the categories in between? subtleties begin to bubble up when factoring in other relationships, from parents and siblings to cousins and friends, and \" it gets weirder the longer you stare at it, \" observes askmen.com. Women are far more comfortable being touched on their shoulders, arms, backs, and near their chests than men, which may not be too surprising, but there's visible discomfort with both men and women being touched below the knee by strangers, acquaintances, and less immediate relatives — a finding that is across the board for men but far more pronounced when women are being touched by uncles and male cousins than aunts and female cousins. The researchers also demarcated \" taboo zones, \" and while men say their genital areas are off limits to their parents and siblings, that same zone isn't out of bounds for female acquaintances — or even female strangers.

            "It was a $ 2.6 billion day of reckoning for jpmorgan chase over its decades of dealings with bernard madoff. Federal prosecutors announced a $ 1.7 billion settlement with the bank, which was accused of ignoring red flags about madoff's crimes, and allegedly turning a blind eye to his massive fraud while acting as his banker. U.s. Attorney preet bharara in new york city said the funds will compensate victims of madoff, convicted mastermind of the biggest ponzi scheme in history. In addition to the settlement with prosecutors, jpmorgan chase agreed to pay $ 350 million to the office of the comptroller of the currency and another $ 543 million to irving picard, a court-appointed trustee seeking to recover lost assets for madoff victims. Related: five things you didn't know about madoff's scam \" we recognize we could have done a better job pulling together various pieces of information and concerns about madoff from different parts of the bank over time, \" wrote jpmorgan spokesman joseph evangelisti in an e-mail to cnnmoney.

On july 11, more than 800,000 people in uttar pradesh state planted nearly 50 million saplings in 24 hours in a bid to set a new guinness world record, popular science reports. The figure has yet to be certified, as national geographic notes, but if it is, it will trounce the previous record of 847,275 trees set by pakistan in 2013. India has reserved more than $ 6.2 billion for tree-planting initiatives in all of its 29 states, the ap reports. The effort stems from commitments made at the 2015 climate change summit in paris. \"the world has realized that serious efforts are needed to reduce carbon emissions to mitigate the effects of global climate change, \" says one official from uttar pradesh. India has had much deforestation in recent centuries due to demand for firewood and the creation of pastures and development space. Eighth-grader shashwat rai planted a fig species known locally as a peepal. \" i've read in a book that this tree releases maximum oxygen, \" he tells the ap. \" there is so much pollution in the city, we need trees that produce oxygen. \" a tree planted, however, is not necessarily a tree gained. According to reports, up to 40 % of the saplings will die. Forestry workers will use aerial photographs to keep watch over the trees. As for young rai, he says he ' ll check his tree often, adding, \" i don't want this plant to die. \" india's not the only country getting in on the tree-planting action, per national geographic: african nations say they will reforest nearly 250 million acres by 2030.

        "summary": "For the first time, fentanyl has been used in the execution of a us prisoner. Carey dean moore was put to death via lethal injection at the nebraska state penitentiary tuesday morning using a previously untested combination of four drugs: fentanyl citrate, the powerful synthetic opioid blamed for deadly overdoses as the nation struggles with an opioid epidemic; the tranquilizer diazepam; the muscle relaxant cisatracurium besylate; and potassium chloride to stop the heart. \" we really don't know how fentanyl is going to play out in an execution, as opposed to an opioid overdose, \" a law professor told the new york times in advance of the execution. \" simply because people are dying as a result of fentanyl doesn't mean they're dying in a way that would be considered acceptable as a form of execution. \" moore, 60, was convicted of killing two taxi drivers in 1979, and while he did not seek a last-minute reprieve from his sentence, two pharmaceutical companies did attempt to block the execution, arguing their reputations would be harmed. But prison officials wouldn't identify the suppliers of the drugs, so since the companies couldn't prove their products were being used, the execution — nebraska's first since 1997 — was allowed to proceed. According to usa today, witnesses reported no apparent complications beyond some coughing by moore. He reportedly said \" i love you \" several times before dying. The four-drug cocktail that was used could offer a new execution method to states that are struggling to obtain execution drugs, but the inclusion of fentanyl has raised ethical concerns. ( another execution that planned to use fentanyl was halted in nevada. )",

A british 7-year-old has just pulled a sword from that very spot. While on holiday in cornwall on aug. 29, matilda jones asked her dad if she could go for a swim to beat the heat, reports the sheffield star. He agreed and, on their way to dozmary pool, told his daughter how king arthur's legendary sword was said to rest there. Shortly after wading into the lake, matilda told her dad she'd found a sword. \" i told her not to be silly and it was probably a bit of fencing, \" paul jones tells the star. \" but when i looked down i realized it was a sword. It was just there lying flat on the bottom of the lake. \" jones isn't holding out hope that the 4-foot-long sword is the one that inspired the arthurian legend. It's \" about 20 or 30 years old \" and \" probably an old film prop, \" he says. But its discovery is still a neat coincidence. According to legend, the lady of the lake gave excalibur to arthur at dozmary pool, where it was returned after his death. It is said that a hand rose from the waters to receive the sword and brandished it three times before both disappeared. Despite the legend, however, treasure hunters would be foolhardy to search dozmary pool for the fabled sword. Droughts have twice dried out the shallow lake, revealing no ancient sword at the bottom, per cornwall live. ( a medieval knight's sword was recently found in a bog. )",

Jonathan turley, a professor at the george washington university, has argued in favor of the suit against obama's executive order delaying the employer mandate provision of obamacare. Story continued below this is republicans'third lawyer since the suit was initially passed in july. Two previous lawyers dropped the case and the house has yet to file the lawsuit in federal court. ( also on politico: reid releases iron grip on senate floor ) \"professor turley is a renowned legal scholar who agrees that president obama has clearly overstepped his constitutional authority, \" said michael steel, a spokesperson for speaker john boehner. \"he is a natural choice to handle this lawsuit. \" republicans argue that obama overstepped when he delayed the provision in obamacare that mandated that employers provide health care to their workers. Democrats quickly criticized the selection. \"even for $ 500-per-hour in taxpayer dollars, speaker boehner has had to scour washington to find a lawyer willing to file this meritless lawsuit against the president, \" said drew hammill, a spokesperson for minority leader pelosi. \"now, he '",
            "As many on this blog are aware, i have previously testified, written, and litigated in opposition to the rise of executive power and the countervailing decline in congressional power in our tripartite system. I have also spent years encouraging congress, under both democratic and republican presidents, to more actively defend its authority, including seeking judicial review in separation of powers conflicts. For that reason, it may come as little surprise this morning that i have agreed to represent the united states house of representatives in its challenge of unilateral, unconstitutional actions taken by the obama administration with respect to implementation of the affordable care act ( aca ). It is an honor to represent the institution in this historic lawsuit and to work with the talented staff of the house general counsel's office. As in the past, this posting is meant to be transparent about my representation as well as my need to be circumspect about my comments in the future on related stories.

        "summary": "Donald and crystal howard went out on halloween to buy more face paint and candy. But the georgia parents were killed in a car crash near their morgan county home, leaving a young state trooper with a terrible task: breaking the news to their four kids, ages 6 to 13, npr reports. But 24-year-old trooper nathan bradley, who found out it would take their next nearest relative hours to get there, didn't want the kids to find out the tragic news from a stranger; he also wanted to protect the memory of halloween for them. So instead, he took the children out for burgers, followed by a movie night back at the trooper post, where they were joined by the sheriff and other residents. It wasn't easy. \" it was important to me that i would not lie to them, \" bradley tells the atlanta journal constitution, noting he distracted the kids and changed the subject when their parents were brought up. The kids ' grandma arrived the next morning and told the children the terrible news. Bradley gave the oldest child his phone number so he could call whenever he needed to and set up a gofundme page for the kids, which has amassed $ 225,000 as of this writing. The kids are now preparing to move to florida with their grandmother. Not everyone finds the story inspirational. Over at gawker, brendan o ' connor wonders if the trooper should have been upfront with the kids in what he labels \" a legitimate ethical conundrum. \" \" instead of associating halloween with the tragic death of his parents, the eldest — at least initially, and eventually, probably the rest of the kids — will associate it with being deceived for literally hours on end by an authority figure withholding from him the fact that his parents had died. \" ( hear the entire story from bradley's perspective on the gofundme page. )",

Federal defender john palombi says his office was \" saddened \" to hear of the death, which he blames on prison underfunding and understaffing. \" borden suffered from severe mental illness and chronic physical pain, both of which were undertreated by the department of corrections despite their knowledge of these issues, \" palombi said in a statement. Borden was within three hours of being executed on oct. 5 last year when a stay of execution was granted amid claims that alabama's lethal injection method of execution was unconstitutional. The stay of execution was lifted in november and a request to reinstate it was rejected in february, though it's not clear whether borden had been given a new execution date, fox reports.

The 25,000 deaths were first noticed on saturday, as bees tumbled from 55 linden trees in bloom, the oregonian reports. \" they were literally falling out of the trees, \" a biologist tells the portland tribune; he calculated that some 150 colonies likely met their end. Adds an agriculture official: \" i've never encountered anything quite like it in 30 years in the business. \" pesticides — particularly a neonicotinoid called safari that may have been sprayed by a landscape company on the trees on saturday — could be to blame, though test results might not be in until the weekend. A safari product label apparently warns that it's \" highly toxic \" for bees and shouldn't be used when they're around. Officials are now putting bee-blocking nets over the trees to halt the deaths, the oregonian reports. Honeybee deaths have been widely reported, but bumblebees have also been in decline, the paper notes. \" bumblebees are the single most important natural pollinator in oregon, \" says a conservation advocate.

Canada's karolane baillargeon is the latest addition to that club after heading to a quebec hospital last week for what she believed were stomach cramps — and signing her discharge papers with a baby girl in tow. \" i really wasn't feeling well, \" baillargeon, 25, tells cbc news. \" i had major cramps … so i went to the hospital emergency room. That's when they told me they were contractions. \" baillargeon was 39 weeks pregnant and in labor, so she was taken straight off to the er, where she gave birth a few hours later to the healthy 7-pound, 11-ounce annabelle. Baillargeon explains that she gained only about 20 pounds over the pregnancy, which she attributed to weight gain from the contraception she says she was taking and the fact that she and boyfriend brian lanthier \" don't work out and don't eat well, \" she tells the cbc. Her doctors also informed her that she had carried little annabelle more toward the back, so her stomach didn't swell as much as in a regular pregnancy. Baillargeon and lanthier had eventually wanted to have children, so annabelle just proved to be an extra-early blessing. \" it's nine months of preparation that we never had … but as soon as we saw her, we immediately fell in love with her, \" baillargeon tells the cbc, with lanthier adding, \" i feel so proud. I have a little girl in good health and that's all that counts. \" ( an italian nun who didn't know she was pregnant gave birth to a baby boy — and named him after the pope. )",

Indeed, he tweeted this month, \" i will always protect our @potus. \" but when trump called another longtime legal adviser last week, that adviser gave the president a clear warning: don't trust cohen, because he will almost certainly flip for prosecutors, reports the wall street journal. On a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being the most loyal, cohen \" isn't even a 1, \" jay goldberg says he told the president in a phone call on friday. He also warned trump that cohen might wear a wire in conversations with the president. \" anyone who is facing 30 years doesn't stand up, \" said goldberg, per cnn. Cohen could indeed face serious jail time on charges of bank fraud and campaign finance fraud following the unprecedented fbi raid on his offices. Politico also reports that trump and his allies are growing more and more concerned about the possibility of cohen flipping. \" they're going to threaten him with a long prison term and try to turn him into a canary that sings, \" says alan dershowitz. The story notes that the white house found it a little worrisome that cohen referred to the raiding agents as \" courteous and respectful \" instead of being his usual bombastic self, and it also notes that spokesperson sarah huckabee sanders seemed to create a bit of distance between the two men by pointing out that trump has many attorneys.

Seven men were given life sentences — three of those received multiple life sentences, notes the ap — while another two teenagers were sentenced to lesser terms of at least 20 years each. The convictions stemmed from multiple incidents this year and last year. The verdict was greeted with shouts of \" injustice! \" from the defendants, adds reuters, while one victim cried in relief and victims ' rights advocates cheered the crackdown. \" this verdict is pure justice and the least that those people can get for the crimes they committed, \" said one victim's lawyer. The problem — which rose to global prominence when video went viral of a naked victim at a mass rally last month for new president abdul-fattah al-sisi — had reached endemic levels: 250 assaults had been documented in tahrir square since 2011, with zero resulting in investigations until al-sisi was forced to take action in the wake of public outcry.

The total eclipse will go down about 2: 41am et, and last about an hour. The longest night is also the darkest: not only is the sun below the horizon the longest, but the eclipse further blocks light from the sky. Once in an orange moon: that orb in the sky might well glow orange or even blood red, depending on how much particulate matter's in the atmosphere. What's happening up there: the earth is passing directly between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's rays from reflecting off the moon. You can see it: the eclipse will be visible and you can watch it without eye protection. Look high in the sky: one of the benefits of the eclipse falling on winter solstice, when the sun is lowest in the sky. Also look for: shooting stars.

Investigators believe the same suspect is behind at least two murders and a third attack that left a homeless man fighting for his life, the san diego union-tribune reports. The first victim was found ablaze under a freeway bridge, and police say an autopsy revealed \" trauma to his upper torso \" that probably killed the man before he was set on fire. Within hours, the other two victims were found, one dead and one with life-threatening injuries. All of the victims suffered similar trauma to the upper torso, and san diego homicide capt. David nisleit says there is no doubt in his mind \" that these cases are being conducted by the same person. \" police released this video of a suspect they believe is connected to the three attacks. He was caught on video at a convenience store near the site of the first attack, and witnesses say they saw him running across interstate 5 carrying a gas can. Police and community organizations have been working to warn homeless people of the danger and urge them to sleep in groups. \" we were talking to folks, and there's a lot of scared folks out there.

That's what politico reveals after a somewhat cringe-inducing inquiry into who's interested in speaking at the republican national convention in cleveland next month, noting that after placing calls to more than 50 big-name senators, governors, and house reps, the usually coveted speaking roles aren't garnering much interest in \" the year of trump. \" \" only a few said they were open to it — and everyone else said they either weren't planning on it, didn't want to, weren't going to cleveland at all, or simply didn't respond, \" the site notes.

Trey gowdy, who will be going to the beach instead. Even trump's former rivals are hedging on an rnc speaking gig, usually seen as a \" precious commodity, \" per politico: marco rubio doesn't think he ' ll even be asked ( and he says he won't trump-stump if he is ), while a john kasich rep gave a \" no comment. \" all of that falls under \" passive gop \" news: per a sunday conference call, a more active group — what politico deems \" anti-trump forces \" — is dispatching an \" advance team \" to cleveland this week to try to keep trump from nabbing the nomination. It will try to \" unbind \" delegates so they're free to \" vote their conscience, \" resulting in seeming confusion among delegates on exactly how to do that, as well as pushback from pro-trump delegates, including one who calls attempts to derail trump a \" desperate, selfish attempt at self-promotion by a very tiny minority of the national republican delegates. \" ( george will probably won't show up. )",

The arson allegation is because 25-year-old marshay frenard allegedly doused one of the stuffed bears with lighter fluid and set it ablaze in his girlfriend's home after she dumped him. He also allegedly sliced open another teddy bear with a knife. Wreg reports the knifed bear belonged to the ex's child. Frenard eventually left but allegedly threatened to return and burn down the home, say police. The burning bear didn't cause any damage — frenard threw it in the fireplace — but he's still charged with aggravated arson, along with domestic violence.",
