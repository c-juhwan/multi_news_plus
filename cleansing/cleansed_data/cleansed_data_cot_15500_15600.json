        "summary": "To pee or not to pee in the shower, that is the question. Various surveys have shown that lots of people do it — one questionnaire on buzzfeed found that more than 80 % of those surveyed say they do. Now ifl science weighs in on the issue, noting that relieving ourselves while showering can help conserve water. In fact, estimating that people pee on average seven times a day, the site calculates that taking away one 1.6-gallon flush across 319 million americans every day could conserve 185 billion gallons of water a year, which is no small matter. Mic, which is clearly biased in favor of peeing in the shower being \" awesome, \" reports that some of this conservation is likely lost in added shower time ( \" who among us, mid-shower pee, hasn't stared off into oblivion as the hot water cascaded down our bodies? \" ). Still, that 0.875 gallon of water that will escape the shower head in the 21 seconds it takes for the average person to pee is still less than the 1.6 gallons — more in older toilets — used to flush urine away. ( it turns out that all mammals, regardless of their size, pee in about 21 seconds. ) and for those who wipe when they pee, they could save an entire roll of toilet paper every 50 days. ( in other bathroom news, here are 5 ways to poop better. )",

That means that each day of weeing takes 42 liters ( 11.1 gallons ) of toilet water to flush away.

Schiller, a former nypd detective who began working for trump in 1999 as a part-time bodyguard, is leaving to take a higher-paying job.

On may 9, trump sent schiller to fbi headquarters to deliver the letter firing comey, an incident that prompted deputy attorney general rod rosenstein to appoint former fbi director robert mueller as special counsel to oversee the investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. At the time, cnn reported that a former white house aide called schiller, who became trump's head of security in 2005, the \" most underestimated person on trump's team. \" if schiller does leave, only two former trump organization employees will remain in the white house, communications director hope hick and social media director dan scavino, cnn reports.

Krebs recounts the story of a curious reader who saw a photo of a friend's boarding pass on facebook and was surprised by how much he found out by putting the barcode image into an online decoder. The information from the code was enough to access the passenger's frequent-flyer account, which would have allowed a hacker to do things like change seats or cancel flights, as well as learn enough to break into other accounts, writes krebs, who notes that united airlines seems to \" treat its customers ' frequent flyer numbers as secret access codes. \" the security hole probably won't be much of a problem for most people as long as they don't leave their boarding passes lying around, writes jamie condliffe at gizmodo, but it should be a \" reminder to be careful about what you post online. \" ( this security researcher found enough bugs to earn 1 million free air miles. )",

Cory took a screen shot of the boarding pass, enlarged it, and quickly found a site online that could read the data. \"i found a website that could decode the data and instantly had lots of info about his trip, \" cory said, showing this author step-by-step exactly how he was able to find this information.

Hopkins and abigail briefly reconciled in the 1990s, and she actually had cameos in two of hopkins ' films. Apparently, however, the 80-year-old actor is once again estranged from 48-year-old abigail, who uses or has used the surname harrison, though her official website uses the name hopkins. The sun reports she is a singer-songwriter and actress who has, in the past, said that her relationship with hopkins contributed to her struggles with drug addiction and mental health.

Coming up with such an argument in this case might be difficult, however. An expert tells abc that trump would have to show comey's testimony \" would cause undo public harm by compromising national security or an ongoing investigation. \" trump's own tweets about his conversations with comey might also hurt an argument for secrecy. There's also the matter of public opinion: blocking comey from testifying might look as though trump has something to hide. In an explainer on the issue, the new york times notes that comey's new status as a private citizen, as opposed to a government employee, also may complicate any white house effort to block him.

        "summary": "Australia's government is in turmoil as prime minister malcolm turnbull fights for his political life because of a challenge from within his own ruling party. The battle has resulted in a tense showdown: turnbull says he's willing to step down if the majority of liberal party lawmakers — the magic number is 43 — want him to go, but there's one big catch. He wants those 43 names to be made public before he ' ll allow a party vote on friday, and so far, his rivals haven't been able to produce the names. As the ap explains, lawmakers who might otherwise vote against turnbull in the party's secret ballot might be unwilling to sign a public petition for fear of retribution from voters. The background: why the revolt: some dizzying semantics: despite the name, the liberal party is actually conservative, though turnbull himself is seen by his critics as too liberal on social issues, explains the wall street journal. For example, main rival peter dutton wants to take a much harder line than turnbull on immigration issues. In general, more australian voters are starting to favor right-wing and populist movements, notes the journal.",

Secretary of state mike pompeo got directly on the case tuesday in riyadh, where he was sent by trump to meet with king salman and foreign minister adel al-jubeir, reuters and cbs news report. After that sit-down, pompeo was expected to dine later monday with crown prince mohammed bin salman ( aka mbs ), who's been linked to an order to abduct khashoggi, an ex-senior us official tells the new york times. Pompeo's meeting with the king was \" hastily arranged \" and \" short \"; cnn estimates it lasted just 15 minutes, based on motorcade arrival and departure times. State department rep heather nauert didn't reveal much about the meeting, other than pompeo thanking the king \" for his commitment to supporting a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation. \" meanwhile, witnesses tell reuters that turkish crime scene officials scoured the saudi consulate in istanbul, where khashoggi was last seen, for more than nine hours monday, and a turkish government rep says police are expected to go back tuesday. Cnn reporters noted that before investigators descended upon the consulate, they'd seen a cleaning crew head inside. President recep tayyip erdogan offered a bit of eyebrow-raising insight into what authorities are focusing on. \" the investigation is looking into many things such as toxic materials and those materials being removed by painting them over. \" ( did khashoggi's apple watch record his own death? some aren't so sure. )",

South korea was not a signatory. The armistice was only ever intended as a temporary measure. The document, signed by us lt gen william k harrison and his counterpart from the north's army, general nam il, said it was aimed at a ceasefire \" until a final peaceful settlement is achieved \". However that settlement never came, and a conference in geneva in 1954 which was designed to thrash out a formal peace"

Reports from china say the city of yumen, population around 100,000, was split into quarantine zones after a 38-year-old man died from the plague, reuters finds. He had apparently contracted it from a marmot, a wild rodent in the squirrel family. Some 151 people he came into contact with have been quarantined, but none have shown signs of the disease. Since the plague is treatable with antibiotics and ( in this victim's case ) can't be transmitted from person to person unless it develops into pneumonic plague, the chinese response appears extreme to outside observers. \" i feel there's something here that we don't know, because this seems a very expansive response to just one case, \" a professor of infectious diseases tells livescience. \" i ' m very puzzled at the circumstances here, and what the actual hazard is, \" he says. On its website, beijing's disease control center reassures people that there's no chance of the disease spreading to the city.

A 38-year-old victim was infected by a marmot, a wild rodent, and died on july 16. Several districts of the city of about 100,000 people in gansu province were subsequently turned into special quarantine zones, xinhua said. It said 151 people who came into direct contact with the victim were also placed in quarantine. None have so far shown any signs of infection, the news agency said. The city had set aside 1 million yuan ( $ 161,200 ) for emergency vaccinations, the jiuquan daily, a local newspaper, said on tuesday. The plague is a bacterial disease spread by the fleas of wild rodents such as marmots. While the disease can be effectively treated, patients can die 24 hours after the initial infection, the world health organisation says. Outbreaks in china have been rare in recent years, and most have happened in remote rural areas of the west. China's state broadcaster said there were 12 diagnosed cases and three deaths in the province of qinghai in 2009, and one in sichuan in 2012. Beijing's disease control centre sought to dispel worries about a wider outbreak of the disease in china, saying on its website (",

A city in china has reportedly been sealed off after one resident died from bubonic plague, but this way of trying to contain the disease is puzzling to infectious disease experts, who say the response seems extreme given the information released about the case. According to news reports, chinese officials have blocked off parts of yumen, a city in northwest china, preventing about 30,000 of the city's people from leaving. A man in the city became ill after he handled a dead marmot ( a large wild rodent ), and died last week from bubonic plague. No other cases of the plague have been reported, according to the guardian. About 150 people who had contact with the plague victim have been placed under quarantine. Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria yersinia pestis that is carried by rodents, and can be transmitted to people through flea bites or by direct contact with the tissues or fluids of an animal with plague, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. The disease is known for killing millions of people in europe in the 1300s, in a pandemic called the black death. Today the illness is treatable with antibiotics, the cdc says. Now there are fewer than 5,000 cases"

In the first season, the question was \" did he do it? \" this time around, it's \" why did bergdahl leave? \" listeners will hear bergdahl speak about his alleged desertion in afghanistan, reports the guardian, his time in taliban captivity, and rescue. The audio comes from mark boal, the writer and producer of zero dark thirty, who conducted 25 hours of phone interviews with bergdahl as research for a film. Bergdahl — who could face life in prison over charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy — gave permission for the recordings to be used by the serial team, which has also completed \" extensive additional reporting, \" per the new yorker. Though bergdahl's story is well-known, it's not without mystery. Bergdahl's lawyers say he walked off base to spotlight the poor conditions soldiers endured, but his comrades say otherwise. Bergdahl's story \" starts with one idiosyncratic guy, who makes a radical decision to leave his post, to walk away into afghanistan. And the consequences of this decision spin out, wider and wider, until you find out that the picture is not at all what you expected, \" koenig says in the first episode — released thursday — which examines a taliban-produced video of bergdahl's release and the fallout back home. Bergdahl also speaks about losing his sense of self in captivity. \" i would wake up not even remembering what i was.

It's the first chapter in a season-long exploration of the case of bowe bergdahl, the american former prisoner of war. Bergdahl walked off his army base in afghanistan in 2009, and he was soon captured by the taliban. Six u.s. Soldiers who were killed in afghanistan after his disappearance, some claim, died directly or indirectly because of his actions. Bergdahl was held captive for almost five years and released in a prisoner exchange in may, 2014. The first season of \"serial \" — about the 1999 murder of a baltimore teen, hae min lee, and the conviction of her ex-boyfriend adnan syed for the crime — asked a specific question: did he do it? that question raised broader questions about reasonable doubt, about memory and truth, about the u.s. System of justice. The second season does something different. The basic facts in the case of bergdahl are known, and most parties involved agree on what they are. But what those facts mean, what bergdahl actually experienced in the army, his motivations for leaving his platoon, and the many terrible consequences of that decision are more complex, even existential. The episode begins with \"serial \"'s host,",

            "This morning at 6 a.m., \" dustwun, \" the first episode of season two of the \"serial \" podcast, quietly made its début. It's the first chapter in a season-long exploration of the case of bowe bergdahl, the american former prisoner of war. Bergdahl walked off his army base in afghanistan in 2009, and he was soon captured by the taliban. Six u.s. Soldiers who were killed in afghanistan after his disappearance, some claim, died directly or indirectly because of his actions. Bergdahl was held captive for almost five years and released in a prisoner exchange in may, 2014. The first season of \"serial \" — about the 1999 murder of a baltimore teen, hae min lee, and the conviction of her ex-boyfriend adnan syed for the crime — asked a specific question: did he do it? that question raised broader questions about reasonable doubt, about memory and truth, about the u.s. System of justice. The second season does something different. The basic facts in the case of bergdahl are known, and most parties involved agree on what they are. But what those facts mean, what bergdahl actually experienced in the army, his motivations for leaving his platoon, and the many terrible consequences of that decision are more complex, even existential. The episode begins with \"serial \"'s host,",

Friction between sanders'supporters and state democratic party leaders had flared throughout the day on saturday. The convention was scheduled to end by 7pm and when it hadn't wrapped up by 10pm, authorities at the paris las vegas casino informed party organizers they could no longer provide the security necessary to handle the crowd, the ap reports. The hostilities began when sanders supporters accused state party leaders of putting them at a disadvantage, and they objected to procedural votes to approve the rules of the event on saturday. They also questioned a credentials committee's disqualification of 58 would-be sanders delegates. State party officials said the would-be delegates didn't provide acceptable identification and did not meet the may 1 deadline to register as democrats. \" we were just trying to force the democratic process, \" angie morelli, an attendee elected to be a national delegate representing sanders, tells the las vegas review-journal. Morelli isn't happy about how the event was handled. \" that's not how you unite a party, \" she says. \" they didn't care about giving us any voice whatsoever. \" after getting seven of the 12 delegate spots up for grabs at the convention, clinton, who won the february caucuses, has a five-delegate advantage over sanders in nevada, 20 to his 15, and is expected to win a majority of the state's eight unpledged superdelegates.",

He is respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars. In addition to that, and perhaps more importantly, he is a very good person. \" the new york times paints a far less rosy picture of kushner's position in the white house in the wake of the news that kushner allegedly tried to set up a secret communications line between the kremlin and the trump transition team.

Now more evidence reported by rescue workers and citizens has piled up that toxins continue to be deployed via chlorine bombs in the war-torn country, the new york times reports. The un adopted a resolution in march that permits economic or military action against parties using chlorine gas as a weapon in syria; the resolution was partly necessary because the toxin, due to its use in everyday applications, wasn't technically on the list of chemicals president assad was ordered to destroy, per the times. However, neither of the warring factions — assad's forces or anti-assad insurgents — has been officially blamed, which stalls meting out punishment. Meanwhile, rescue workers and doctors in syria are gathering as much evidence as they can to present to foreign governments — a challenge since chlorine doesn't last long in blood, urine, air, or soil, per the times. The un security council has been stuck in assigning blame, with russia — a syrian ally — creating the greatest obstacle due to its veto against blaming syria, the paper notes; the us ambassador to the un told the ap in march that russia's resistance has been \" extremely disruptive \" to ending the four-year civil war in syria. The organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons, a watchdog group keeping an eye on activity in syria and reporting on the bombings, has also been unable to definitively point the finger, per the times. Witnesses have their suspicions, however. \" we know the sound of a helicopter that goes to a low height and drops a barrel, \" a white helmets rescue worker tells the paper. \" nobody has aircraft except the regime. \" in the meantime, residents continue to carry around walkie-talkies to warn each other of approaching aircraft and keep water supplies well-stocked to wash victims down after the bombs are dropped, the times notes.",

            "A new australian bush tomato species, discovered by a team of researchers led by biology professor chris martine of bucknell university, has been named after main character mark watney from the book and film the martian. The authors, among whom is the undergraduate student emma frawley, have published the new species in the open-access journal phytokeys. Martine announced the new name, solanum watneyi, in the huffington post last year when he described it as a tribute to the heroic portrayal of watney as a nasa botanist and engineer who saves himself with plant science expertise after being stranded on mars. In fact, matt damon's botanist character impressed both the audience and the critics so much that it resulted in several academy awards nominations to the whole production team. The actor himself received a golden globe among many other prestigious recognitions including the bafta for best actor and the critics ' choice award for best actor. \" this is a botanist portrayal that turns an unusually bright spotlight on authentic scientific endeavor, \" martine explains the choice. \" scientist heroes are already unusual in hollywood, but a space-deserted protagonist who studies plants as a profession is something extraordinary. \" however, according to martine, the decision to name the species after watney also has some taxonomic relevance. \" the plant that watney manages to grow on mars is none other than"

It was, however, a very long worm. This particularly disgusting cautionary tale comes from a jan. 8 episode of the medical podcast this won't hurt a bit. Npr ( which has pictures ) reports dr. Kenny banh was working the emergency room of fresno's community regional medical center a few months ago when a man came in complaining of bloody diarrhea and asking to be treated for worms. Banh, according to the san francisco chronicle, is typically skeptical of people who claim to have a tapeworm. But in this case, the man had the receipt, as it were. He handed banh a grocery bag containing a toilet paper roll around which was wrapped a \" giant \" tapeworm. Banh says the worm started coming out of the man while he was sitting on the toilet, and he originally thought his \" guts are coming out. \" \" he doesn't get it until he pulls it out, and then it wiggles, \" kgo quotes banh as saying. Banh says the worm had likely been growing inside the man for at least half a year. When he unrolled it on the floor of the emergency room lobby it measured 5 feet 6 inches long. The man's love of salmon sashimi is the likely source of the tapeworm, known as a helminth. \" i eat raw salmon almost every day, \" banh says the man confessed. Last year, the cdc released a study regarding japanese broad tapeworms found in certain alaskan salmon, creating a risk for people who eat raw or under-cooked salmon. Banh says the man swore off sashimi following treatment.",

But it was a bad night for one socialist: segolene royal, hollande's former partner and mother of his four children. She was defeated by a dissident member of the same party, ending the former party leader's hopes of becoming speaker of the national assembly.

Brian weiner steers patients away from fad diets, but his findings on ice have inspired him to write a free e-book of his own: the ice diet. \" while eating ice, you are serving two purposes, \" weiner tells the atlantic. \" you are burning calories and not eating positive-calorie foods. \" ( he calls ice a \" negative-calorie food, \" kpcc notes ). By weiner's calculations, it appears to be \" generally safe \" for adults to eat a liter of ice a day. That one liter burns 160 calories, he argues — the number you'd burn by running a mile. A physics writer, however, calculates that you'd need to eat 66 pounds of ice to lose a pound of weight. \" not exactly the most efficient diet plan, \" writes andrew zimmerman jones at about.com. Weiner, meanwhile, offers a number of safety guidelines: don't, for instance, eat more than a liter a day. That could be toxic. And be careful eating ice when it's cold out. \" i never thought i would be actively promoting and discussing weight loss diets, \" weiner writes. \" i earnestly hope not to get lumped in with the counter-productive fad diet ( snake oil ) promoters. \" ( another interesting recent diet idea? the ice cream cleanse. )",

Equal pay day was originated by the national committee on pay equity ( ncpe ) in 1996 as a public awareness event to illustrate the gap between men's and women's wages. Since census statistics showing the latest wage figures will not be available until late august or september, ncpe leadership decided years ago to select a tuesday in april as equal pay day. ( tuesday was selected to represent how far into the next work week women must work to earn what men earned the previous week. ) the date also is selected to avoid religious holidays and other significant events. Because women earn less, on average, than men, they must work longer for the same amount of pay. The wage gap is even greater for most women of color.",

        "summary": "You've seen it when someone disagrees with you: a furrowed brow, tight lips, and raised chin. It's a face that means, basically, no — and it's actually universal. The same team of researchers that identified these 21 facial expressions say the \" not face \" is used so instinctively that it might as well be part of our language. Scientists at ohio state thought humans might possess a single expression of disapproval — perhaps a combination of anger, disgust, and contempt — based on the idea that humans developed the ability to express danger or aggression before language, per a press release. So they put 158 native speakers of english, spanish, mandarin chinese, and american sign language in front of a camera and asked them to recite negative sentences or answer questions about issues with which they were likely to disagree. Computer algorithms later searched the film for common facial expressions tied to their negative responses. The \" not face \" appeared — combining the furrowed brows of anger, the raised chin of disgust, and the tight lips of contempt — at the same frequency as speech. \" that is, we all instinctively make the ' not face ' as if it were part of our spoken or signed language, \" the release explains. This implies that it's a facial grammatical marker, \" a sound or facial expression or sign that has some grammatical function \" and that differentiates \" animal communication from human language, \" researcher aleix martinez tells the washington post. \" to our knowledge, this is the first evidence that the facial expressions we use to communicate negative moral judgment have been compounded into a unique, universal part of language. \" an interesting tidbit: in some cases, asl speakers made the \" not face \" rather than actually signing the word \" not, \" which had never been documented before. \" this facial expression not only exists, but in some instances, it is the only marker of negation in a signed sentence, \" says martinez, whose research is published in cognition.

Earlier, reuters reported that the rebels entered the capital with little resistance. Rebels say they currently control a handful of tripoli neighborhoods. Gadhafi recently gave his second audio message in less than 24 hours on state tv, urging those in tripoli to arm themselves and \" fight for your politics, your oil, your land. I am with you in tripoli — together until the ends of the earth, \" he shouted, sounding angry.

The management company that represented genest also said in a statement to people that the cause of genest's death \" is yet to be determined. \" it was genest's girlfriend who discovered his body when she went to look for him after he never came back from having a smoke, leduc says. \" he's not someone who, we feel, would commit suicide.

Circus artist jennifer bobette, who knew him for 18 years, said the soft-spoken friend she called \"zombie \" lived \"two different lives. \" she said he never brought up his fame when he was home in montreal, where he was part of a community of punks and artists living in a building known as the fattal lofts near railroad tracks in the st-henri neighbourhood. \"he had a famous life, where he was going and doing video clips with lady gaga, but when he was home at fattal he was never talking about that, he became the zombie we always knew, \" said bobette, who preferred to give only her stage name. \"he was putting on his … pants with 10 holes in them, and buying us beer and wine in the parking lot. \" she said the two met as teenagers at dans la rue, which ran a drop-in centre for homeless and at-risk youth. At the time, she said her friend didn't have a single tattoo and dreamed of becoming a circus performer _ a dream he would realize some years later when he and some friends formed a travelling freak show. Genest got his first tattoo at 16 and went on to eventually cover more than 90 per cent of his body in ink, including the image of a skull over his face. According to his website, he holds the guinness world book of records for the most insects tattooed on a human body ( 178 ), as well as the most bones inked on a human body, at 138.

It has also claimed responsibility for the most recent terror attacks in paris and egypt, where a plane containing 229 was downed. Boko haram carries out most of its atrocities in north africa. Over the past year, nigeria witnessed a 300 per cent rise in fatalities from terror acts to 7,512.

Boko haram, which was founded in 2002 as an islamist movement against western education and morphed into an armed insurgency in 2009, has rapidly expanded its scope and ambitions over the past two years, achieving international notoriety in the spring of 2014 by kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls. Much like isis, the organization controls territory in nigeria ( although it has lost some of it over the past year ) and has declared a caliphate in that territory.

The nigerian-based terror group, also known as islamic state's west's africa province ( iswap ), was responsible for 6,644 deaths in 2014. In comparison, isis is believed to have killed 6,073 people in the same period. Boko haram pledged allegiance to the group, also known as the islamic state, in march of this year. Isis has certainly sought - and achieved - global notoriety since it announced its creation of a caliphate across syria and iraq in june 2014. It has its own media arm which pumps out propaganda videos and messages to either inspire supporters or strike fear into those it regards as enemies with graphic footage glorifying executions and torture. It has also claimed responsibility for the most recent terror attacks in paris and egypt, where a plane containing 229 was downed. Boko haram carries out most of its atrocities in north africa. Over the past year, nigeria witnessed a 300 per cent rise in fatalities from terror acts to 7,512. This is the largest increase in terrorist-caused deaths ever recorded by any country, and is predominantly down to boko haram's expansion. In 2013, nigeria ranked fifth in terms of the highest levels of deaths, but moved to second last year. Boko haram is",
            "The grisly attacks in france and lebanon last week have fixed attention on the violence perpetrated by isis. But a study published this week indicates that the world's deadliest terrorist organization actually operates thousands of miles south of paris and beirut, in nigeria. The 2015 global terrorism index, published by the institute for economics &amp; peace, found that boko haram, the nigerian jihadist group, was responsible for 6,644 deaths in 2014, compared with 6,073 at the hands of isis. Boko haram, which was founded in 2002 as an islamist movement against western education and morphed into an armed insurgency in 2009, has rapidly expanded its scope and ambitions over the past two years, achieving international notoriety in the spring of 2014 by kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls. Much like isis, the organization controls territory in nigeria ( although it has lost some of it over the past year ) and has declared a caliphate in that territory. The group is also international; although based in northeastern nigeria, it has launched attacks in cameroon, chad, and niger. In the latest incident, boko haram is the suspected author of an attack in the nigerian city of yola that has left more than 30 people dead.

The brazilian faith healer turned himself in on sunday following allegations he'd sexually abused more than 300 women. It's a fall from grace for a man who oprah once traveled to interview. The latest: the timeline: the accusations began emerging only this month, and the bbc reports authorities took notice when \" john of god, \" or joao teixeira de faria, pulled nearly $ 9 million from a number of bank accounts wednesday, sparking fears he might flee the country. An arrest warrant was issued friday, and the 76-year-old missed the saturday deadline to comply. He turned himself in sunday to police in abadiania, where he's based and where everyone wears white, notes the washington post. He has since been moved to goiania, the capital of goias state, and his lawyer says he plans to file an appeal in the hope of getting faria placed under house arrest rather than kept in police custody. Faria has denied the allegations. So what's he famous for? \" his intense methods of healing, \" as buzzfeed news puts it, which include channeling the spirits of dozens of dead doctors, biblical figures like king solomon, and historical figures like a spanish nobleman from the 1400s to treat people with conditions ranging from leprosy to sinus infections to paralysis. Buzzfeed also links to video that shows surgeries carried out without anesthesia; faria doesn't have a medical license. In other graphic procedures, faria is known to shove forceps high into a patient's nostril.",

In the journal annals of emergency medicine, researchers note an uptick in interest in the so-called \" loperamide high \" via google trends since 2010, which is in line with their poison center's seven-fold increase in calls related to its misuse from 2011 to 2015 and a jump in national poison center calls related to exposure to the drug over roughly the same period. \" because of its low cost, ease of accessibility and legal status, it's a drug that is very, very ripe for abuse, \" says lead author william eggleston of the upstate new york poison center. The over-the-counter drug activates some of the same receptors as other opioids, but the very low dose of the ingredient for treating diarrhea doesn't produce a high. People who take 10 or more times the recommended dose report easing opioid withdrawal symptoms, while higher doses can actually generate an opiate-like high. Unfortunately this level of dosing can — and has, in at least two cases — lethally disrupted the rhythm of people's hearts.

He asked the sec to do away with the requirement that publicly traded businesses file quarterly earnings reports, per the wall street journal. Instead, trump floated the idea of twice-yearly reports. \" that would allow greater flexibility &amp; save money, \" he tweeted. \" i have asked the sec to study! \" as the journal and the washington post explain, the tradition of quarterly reports dates back to the great depression. But trump has now chosen sides in a long-simmering debate on whether reporting every three months in the name of transparency does more harm than good. He and other critics say it makes companies focus on short-term gains rather than investing in long-term stability. In june, none other than warren buffett and jp morgan's jamie dimon co-authored an op-ed in the journal complaining about this very thing. \" the pressure to meet short-term earnings estimates has contributed to the decline in the number of public companies in america over the past two decades, \" they wrote. The sec has yet to respond to trump's public suggestion, reports cnbc. Speaking later to reporters, trump said outgoing pepsico ceo indra nooyi brought up the idea in a recent meeting. \" it made sense to me, because you know we are not thinking far enough out, \" trump said. \" so we're looking at that very, very seriously.

Hussein withdrew nearly $ 1 billion from an iraqi bank in 2003 and started hiding it around the world in the bank accounts of iraqi emigrants.

            "1488 also known as: 8814 1488 is a combination of two popular white supremacist numeric symbols. The first symbol is 14, which is shorthand for the \" 14 words \" slogan: \" we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. \" the second is 88, which stands for \" heil hitler \" ( h being the 8th letter of the alphabet ). Together, the numbers form a general endorsement of white supremacy and its beliefs. As such, they are ubiquitous within the white supremacist movement - as graffiti, in graphics and tattoos, even in screen names and e-mail addresses, such as aryanprincess1488@hate.net.

The new nih rules aren't talking about a gender bias among the scientists themselves, however, but among their test subjects — specifically animals and cells, reports the new york times.

Starting in october, scientists that want federal money must show that they've balanced their male and female test subjects and specimens. \"for most, this has not been on the radar screen as an important issue, \" says the nih's dr. Francis s. Collins. \" what we're trying to do here is raise consciousness. \" scientists have traditionally shied away from female lab animals in the belief that they'd be tougher to use given their menstrual and hormonal cycles, but a spate of recent research has disproven the notion, reports the verge.

One of the images was of the constitution's famous opening line, \"we the people \" and some text from that historic document. But when vetter takes the ice for team usa next month, it won't be found on her mask – the international olympic committee ruled it had to be deleted. From in goal magazine and mask artist ron slater: \"[ it ] had to be removed because no writings of any kind to promote the country is allowed, \" slater explained in an email to ingoal. \"a sort of 'our country is better than your country \" kind of thing that the ioc frowns upon. Her name had to come off because they see it as self promotion. They wanted everything to be team based. … our original idea was 'land of the free, home of the brave, ' and that would have had to have been removed as well. \" the ioc's rule 51 bans any sort of advertising, demonstration, and/or propaganda on an athlete's equipment at the olympics.

More: riot police were withdrawn around lunchtime today after the government said protests had \" mostly calmed down, \" but some schools and banks were closed for the day and public transport was paralyzed in some areas, reports the bbc. The protesters are enraged by beijing's decision to rule out open elections for the semiautonomous territory's chief executive in 2017 — but the mainland government appears unwilling to budge. \" hong kong is china's hong kong, \" a ministry of foreign affairs spokeswoman told reporters today. But the protesters are also standing firm. \" yes, it's going to get violent again because the hong kong government isn't going to stand for us occupying this area, \" an 18-year-old student protester tells reuters. \" we are fighting for our core values of democracy and freedom, and that is not something violence can scare us away from. \" the \" umbrella revolution \" name for the protests is quickly gaining traction, reports nbc. Demonstrators have been using umbrellas to protect themselves against tear gas, and new umbrellas were distributed to protesters today, along with masks and fresh water. The protests are attracting a growing amount of international support, with more than 180,000 signatures on a white house petition calling for president obama to support free elections in hong kong, reports the wall street journal. \" given beijing's records, we fear a second tiananmen massacre will happen in hong kong, \" the letter says, urging the us to make it clear to beijing that the use of force to crush peaceful protests will be \" strongly opposed and severely punished. \"",

Its 14 % approval rating from critics on rotten tomatoes is pretty bleak. Here's what they're saying: chris nashawaty at entertainment weekly says it's \" so witless and unfunny and shoddily made it makes the hangover 2 look like the godfather 2. \" it's understandable why cusack exited the tub. \" without him, though, the whole enterprise pretty much goes up in smoke. \" new leading man corddry provoked \" an almost physical reaction every time he came on screen — something between an outbreak of hives and a fit of dry heaves. \" \" it's a parade of penis jokes — the film almost literally opens with the sight of male genitalia — interspersed with a half-hearted murder investigation, \" writes michael o'sullivan at the washington post. \" if it has plot holes, conceptual laziness, and an overreliance on dumb-insult humor, the film at least seems to know it. There are lots of self-referential jokes that acknowledge its own stupidity. \" \" hot tub time machine 2 leaps forward rather than backward in time and sort of makes one wish the world had ended while it was en route, \" writes john defore at the hollywood reporter.

But some were outraged that beyonce and the dixie chicks, who have been estranged from the country music world since their insult of then-president george bush in 2003, even were allowed to perform, the ap reports.

A study in plos one suggests the creatures can detect rainstorms happening 150 miles away, possibly by hearing them even from that far off. Migrating elephants are known to change direction out of the blue, and researchers haven't been certain why. The namibian research team figured it might be because of rain — as phys.org explains, elephants are regularly looking for water in the region, which is dry outside of the january-to-march rainy season. Researchers placed gps devices on elephants in 14 different herds for seven years. Meanwhile, they kept track of rainfall in the region. They found that changes in the elephants ' movements were associated with the direction of rain. \" we don't know if they can actually hear the thunder or if they are detecting other low-frequency sounds generated by the storms that humans can't hear, \" a researcher says, as the tamutimes reports. \" but there is no doubt they know what direction the rain is. \" this information may help officials protect elephants, discovery reports, because it could provide some guidance as to where the animals are headed.

The two sides are now considered \" neck and neck, \" according to the new york times. The implications of a \" no \" vote are simple: the united kingdom stays intact. A \" yes \" decision, however, wouldn't just grant scotland independence but involve the reworkings of many elements of the country and its relationship with england. Many questions loom. What would the uk be called? what about scotland's currency? will it be able to maintain its welfare state? should scotland remain united with england under a single monarchy and thus continue its claim to queen elizabeth ii? and what would the scottish flag look like? if scotland votes to go its own way, 18 months of negotiations will ensue before independence is official. \" judging from the tone of the campaign, \" reports the new york times, \" it will be a messy and acrimonious divorce. \" ( check out what the queen had to say earlier this week. )",

Is seen as inappropriate. \" and o ' mara's rep had this to say to yahoo news: \" we certainly would not have advised him to go to the factory that made the gun that he used to shoot trayvon martin through the heart. That was not part of our public relations plan. \" as for the visit, tmz ran a photo of a smiling zimmerman shaking the hand of a kel-tec plant employee, and reported that he was asking about the legality of purchasing a kel-tec ksg. Kel-tec issued a statement to yahoo news explaining that zimmerman \" simply wanted to see the manufacturing facility. This is a common occurrence with our customer base that live close by or may be traveling through. \" yahoo news reports the statement did suggest that zimmerman was interested in buying one of the company's tactical shotguns. Meanwhile, in her first british media interview since the verdict, trayvon martin's mother told the bbc she will one day forgive zimmerman. Said sybrina fulton, \" as christians we have to forgive. But it's a process, and we are still going through that healing process. We are still in the process of forgiveness. We know it's coming but we're just not there yet. \" meanwhile, colin powell today weighed in on the zimmerman verdict, calling it \" questionable \" — but not likely to linger in the national psyche.",

The boys, who were found through tips from the public, have been charged with three felonies — criminal mischief, agricultural animal facilities offenses, and burglary — as well as misdemeanor possession of burglar's tools. The englehardts estimated the damage to their hives at $ 60,000 and thought the act of vandalism would put their farm out of business, the sioux city journal reports. But an online fundraiser started by a friend raised more than $ 30,000 to allow wild hill honey to start again in the spring. \"it was amazing, and we are deeply grateful for all of the contributions, \" justin engelhardt says.

If some senators — or even one senator — object, they can just keep talking to delay a vote. That's a filibuster. To stop a filibuster, 60 senators have to vote to stop the filibuster. That's called a \" cloture \" vote. If they can't get 60 votes for cloture, the senate can't schedule a vote on the underlying issue. What is the \" nuclear option \"? it is a senate rule that strips the minority party of the power"

The vanzolini bald-faced saki, a distinctive \" flying monkey \" that sports shaggy hair with golden highlights around its arms and legs, hadn't been seen since 1936, when it was spotted in an isolated part of the brazilian amazon along the border of peru. ( dead specimens were collected 20 years later in another expedition, notes gizmodo. ) led by global conservation institute director laura marsh, a team set out to find the elusive primate on a four-month expedition of the eiru river in a cramped, two-story houseboat. Just four days into the journey, marsh says she saw three vanzolini saki high in the trees and immediately burst into tears. \" it was fantastic, \" she tells national geographic. \" i was trembling and so excited i could barely take a picture. \" a journalist accompanying the team documented the highs and lows of the research trip in a stunning biographic photo essay. She noted that during the expedition, the team learned that a graduate student doing field research nearby obtained a skull and skins from a hunter and, scooping the very title the team had hoped to use, published a paper titled \" rediscovery of vanzolini's bald-faced saki. \" but the team continued its research and plans to publish its findings in the journal oryx later this month. As for the fate of the living vanzolini saki population, marsh believes conservation is key in even the most remote reaches of the rain forest. \" fishing and hunting in every little corner. Large birds were rare. Forest birds were gone. \" ( read about another notable sighting this year. )",

On a recent expedition to the juruá river in the amazon basin, a group of scientists managed to capture the first photographs ever taken of this elusive primate in its natural habitat — and whoa does it ever look weird. As reported in mongabay, the rare saki was spotted earlier this year by a scientific expedition led by dr. Laura marsh, a saki monkey expert. Three years ago, marsh managed to convince the scientific establishment that this monkey is not a subspecies of a related primate, but rather a distinct species in its own right: pithecia vanzolinii. To further her argument and document vanzolini's bald-faced sakis in the wild, she organized a three-month expedition, called houseboat amazon, which proved to be a wild success. Advertisement back in the 1930s, ecuadorian naturalist alfonzo olalla collected a number of live saki specimens, where he described a large monkey with a long fluffy tail and golden fur on its arms. The monkey was seen again in 1956 when two dead specimens were collected by ornithologist fernando da costa novaes and taxidermist m. M. Moreira. Earlier this year, scientists stumbled upon a dead vanzolini's bald-faced saki that had been killed for bush meat. The houseboat amazon expedition was hoping to be the first to observe this animal in the wild in over eight decades.

It's a rare sight now witnessed by millions, thanks to the virginia aquarium, which shared a video of the caribbean reef octopus's birth on facebook and twitter. One of several octopuses that've hatched at the aquarium recently, the creature uses sacs of pigment called chromatophores for camouflage and may have turned dark to mimic the black tabletop under its tank, a curator tells the verge. A spokesman tells phys.org the pigment might've instead been a result of the stress of birth. Any surviving octopuses are likely to remain at the aquarium, though the mother, having completed her life's goal of procreation, will soon die. ( check out this \" sneaky \" new octopus species. )",

            "Last night, a strange video appeared on twitter: it looks like some sort of deep sea bloom — but then a tiny octopus squirts out and zooms away, changing colors from white to purple. What exactly are we seeing here? the video, posted by the virginia aquarium, shows a baby caribbean reef octopus ( octopus briareus ) no bigger than a pinky nail hatching from a bundle of eggs. As for the color change, these octopuses are known to be masters of disguise. \"it was going into an instant camouflage as soon as it came out of the egg, \" says julie levans, senior curator at the aquarium. These octopuses use specialized muscles to open and close little sacs of pigment in their skin called chromatophores — and this little guy was probably responding to the black tabletop beneath its tank. The baby octopus's mom arrived at the aquarium about six months ago, and four months later, she laid between 100 and 200 eggs. Since this softball-sized species is solitary and also sometimes cannibalistic, this octopus lives alone at the aquarium. The eggs themselves weren't surprising — female octopuses typically lay eggs. \"what did catch us by surprise was the fact that they were fertilized, \" levans says. It turns out that these octopuses can store sperm for up to 100 days — and levans suspects that the octopus must have mated in the wild with at least one male before she arrived at the aquarium. Then, the octopus attached her egg bundles to rocks in her tank, where she flushed them with water to keep oxygen flowing past them, and massaged them with her arms. Depending on the water temperature, incubations can take from 50 to 90 days. Somehow, this tiny bundle of eggs fell off the rocks, and the aquarium's team recovered it and put them in a tank. At 4pm on february 6th, the eggs started hatching. Since then, the rest of the eggs in that video and several still attached to the rocks have hatched, and the team hopes more babies will keep popping out over the next couple of days. The survival rate is pretty low for baby octopuses, levans says",
            "Here's your daily squee! our octopus laid eggs and we had several hatch! while we are cautiously optimistic, it is common for octopuses to lay over one hundred eggs in its clutch to ensure at least one makes it to adulthood. Thankfully, these little critters are going to receive the best possible chance from our incredible animal care team."

Moreau was in labor, and the baby — not due until sept. 20 — was in breech position. While his grandmother called 911, jayden helped his mom, who was bleeding on the bathroom floor. \" he just took a deep breath and said, ' ok, mom, just tell me what i need to do, ' \" moreau tells kplc. She says jayden was calm and didn't seem scared at all. \" i wasn't even thinking, \" jayden tells wthr. \" i didn't know what was going on. \" with his new brother not breathing, time was of the essence. Jayden pulled while moreau pushed, and they were able to deliver the baby. Jayden ran to the kitchen to get a nasal aspirator and was able to get his brother breathing.

Moreau says jayden will \" always have a special bond \" with his little brother.",

So a 34-year-old man was told in the only known case of a paternity test being tricked by a so-called \" human chimera, \" the independent reports. It began when a us couple learned that their son, born healthy in 2014 with the aid of a fertility clinic, had a different blood type than his parents. Concerned, the husband took an at-home paternity test and learned that his dna didn't match the son's. \" you can imagine the parents were pretty upset, \" stanford university geneticist barry starr tells buzzfeed. \" they thought the clinic had used the wrong sperm. \" the clinic assured them there was no mix-up, so the couple got a lawyer and approached starr for help. On starr's advice, the father and son took dna ancestry tests and learned that genetically the dad was his son's uncle. In other words, the dad was a \" human chimera \" who had soaked up the genes of a twin that perished in the womb, then passed them on to the son. Starr saw further evidence of chimerism in the father's skin ( which was two-toned in dark and light strips ) and a dna test of his semen, which identified a slight father-son genetic match of 10 %. Human chimerism isn't new, though: it's been seen on tv shows like csi and in real-life cases, like a mom who took a dna test for a kidney transplant and learned she wasn't the biological mother of two of her sons, or another woman who got similar news after submitting a dna sample for welfare payments, the daily beast reports. \" human chimerism is very common, but exquisitely difficult to identify, coming to light almost exclusively by accidents like this, \" a biologist says.
