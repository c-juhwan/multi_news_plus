It's also faced with a dramatic reduction in their poop, which could have profound effects on the planet's ecosystems, reports red orbit. Researchers report in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that the decline in fecal matter of big animals, which play a larger role in the spread of nutrients than previously thought, hurts the earth's nutrient recycling system. Because we don't like to poop where we eat, mammals carry these nutrients around. But because so many of our once-roaming mammals are now dwindling in population or behind fences, their poop, and with it nutrients like phosphorous — which helps with plant fertilization — follow gravity to the ocean floor. Whales in particular are good at bringing phosphorous from the ocean deep to the surface when they feed on the floor and return to the surface to breathe and poop. But whales are one of the many waning populations, bringing 165 million pounds of phosphorus up annually, which is just 23 % of what they used to. \" a world bereft of large wild animals, whether they are whales, salmon, albatrosses, or elephants, is a less productive place — and one that has lost much of its magic, \" one researcher tells the washington post. Fortunately, \" we can turn these effects around by restoring native populations of large vertebrates around the globe, \" he adds. But without successful intervention, the authors warn that the planet's accessible phosphorous could be gone in a half-century.

However, according to the study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, these animal populations'decline into extinction has damaged the earth's nutrient recycling system due to the missing poop. \"this broken global cycle may weaken ecosystem health, fisheries, and agriculture, \" said joe roman, a biologist at the university of vermont and co-author on the new study. Who knew poop could be so important? \"previously, animals were not thought to play an important role in nutrient movement, \" said lead author christopher doughty, an ecologist at the university of oxford. Originally, scientists studied the weathering of rocks and bacteria's nitrogen collection as the main nutrient provider. It is no wonder in the beginning animals were ignored — they've become so small their \"bounty \" was not as prevalent among ecosystems. Now, the study challenges the bottom-up bias by analyzing the importance of animals in \"nutrient distribution \" by how their poop may fertilize areas that previously didn't receive a lot of nutrients, such as ocean surfaces and interior areas of land.

            "How missing mammal poop is weakening the world's ecosystems by abbey hull long ago, giant whales and outsized land mammals roamed the earth, transporting nutrients across the planet through their poop. However, according to the study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, these animal populations'decline into extinction has damaged the earth's nutrient recycling system due to the missing poop. \"this broken global cycle may weaken ecosystem health, fisheries, and agriculture, \" said joe roman, a biologist at the university of vermont and co-author on the new study. Who knew poop could be so important? \"previously, animals were not thought to play an important role in nutrient movement, \" said lead author christopher doughty, an ecologist at the university of oxford. Originally, scientists studied the weathering of rocks and bacteria's nitrogen collection as the main nutrient provider. It is no wonder in the beginning animals were ignored — they've become so small their \"bounty \" was not as prevalent among ecosystems. Now, the study challenges the bottom-up bias by analyzing the importance of animals in \"nutrient distribution \" by how their poop may fertilize areas that previously didn't receive a lot of nutrients, such as ocean surfaces and interior areas of land. Giant animals like the elephant-like gomphotheres, bison herds, and mammoth"

( audiences give it a healthier 76 % ) what happened? \" just because one can append more films to a bankable franchise doesn't mean one should, \" writes leah pickett at chicago reader, labeling the movie a \" cash grab. \" it's \" largely nonsensical and bloated with new characters, subplots, and postscripts to the source material about which the viewer is given little reason to care. \" a twist ending lands \" with an anticlimactic thud, \" to boot. Bilge ebiri liked the ending, which brings \" a vaguely trumpian echo, \" but not much else. Fantastic beasts: the crimes of grindelwald \" has even more setup than the first \" and \" nobody really seems to do anything, \" he writes at vulture, also faulting the script and redmayne for giving scamander an \" irritating \" vibe.

Here's what people are saying: rocco pendola at the street is surprised it took this long, gloating that he predicted that a \" fire tim cook bandwagon \" would get rolling more than a week ago. Philip elmer-dewitt at fortune says he's been \" hearing whispers \" of an ouster for weeks. But \" the people who want tim cook's head on a spike are not friends of apple, \" he cautions, adding that cook still has \" the confidence of the board of directors. \" the real question, writes tom bemis at marketwatch, is \" who in their right mind would want to take on such a thankless task as trying to turn apple around, given the inevitable comparisons with steve jobs \"? he also points out that marcial botched a basic fact, stating that apple had lost half its share price since cook took over ( it's actually up slightly ).

A study published this month looked at more than 59,000 articles from the bbc, huffington post, new york times, fox news, and cnn shared on twitter. It found 59 % of the links shared on twitter were never actually clicked, meaning people are passing along articles without reading them first, the washington post reports. Or as the authors of the study put it in a press release: sharing an article and reading an article are \" poorly correlated. \" \"people are more willing to share an article than read it, \" study co-author arnaud legout says. \"this is typical of modern information consumption. People form an opinion based on a summary, or a summary of summaries, without making the effort to go deeper. \" the post thinks that one finding \"explains so much of the oft-demoralizing cesspool that is internet culture. \" but there's more. The study found that while far more twitter users saw the links posted by the news organizations, the links posted by regular twitter users were far more likely to be clicked, the business standard reports. The links tweeted by regular twitter users accounted for 61 % of all clicks. But that varied by news outlet, with 85 % of clicks to bbc stories coming through links shared by others while only 10 % of fox news clicks came from twitter accounts other than fox. Researchers also reported the lifespan of stories shared on twitter was longer than expected, with 18 % of clicks coming in the second week of a story's existence.

So why is the man not yet swimming in diamonds and rubies? well, getting to the treasure is not so easy, cruise-wilkins tells the bbc's helen soteriou, who visited the \" treasure man \" on mahe's northern coast in the seychelles. Here, according to cruise-wilkins, the french pirate olivier levasseur stowed the treasure he'd stolen from a portuguese ship in the port of bourbon island, now la reunion, in 1721. Afterwards, according to legend, he executed the crew members who'd helped him hide it. But after levasseur was captured in 1730, he is said to have given up a sort of treasure map: 17 lines of symbols written on a piece of parchment that he thrust into the air moments before he was hanged. Cruise-wilkins, who inherited the quest for the treasure from his father, says his years studying the parchment ( reportedly verified by the british museum as from the 1700s ) have led him to a cavern, only accessible by an underwater tunnel, on government land. To dig there, cruise-wilkins needs to pay $ 18,000 for a permit. Even then, any treasure he finds must be split with the government. Financing is an issue but the price is worth it, \" not just to prove my father right but … to beat the pirate at his own game, \" he told the seychelles news agency last year. \" i have found the mental treasure, \" he adds. \" it is only the physical that now remains. \"",

            "According to legend, pirate treasure reportedly worth £ 100 million is buried on an indian ocean island. Although the region is thought to be littered with hidden treasure, this one is said to be the holy grail, the world's biggest booty haul. The story, which reads like a hollywood script, has been passed down through generations on the islands of the seychelles and la réunion. Although many have tried – and failed – to locate the bounty, two men have devoted their lives to the quest. Reginald herbert cruise-wilkins, known locally on the seychelles island of mahé as the 'treasure man ', hunted the fortune for 27 years until his death in 1977. His son john inherited both the nickname and the quest. When i first met john, he immediately barked that i was half an hour late.

            "Images of a cryptogram allegedly created by the 18th century pirate olivier levasseur ( often called \"la buse \", the hawk ) accompanied by sensational claims about hidden pirate booty have been circulating amongst the french treasure hunting community since at least 1934. This was when a book called \"le flibustier mysterieux \" was published in paris, written by well-respected french marine historian charles bourrel de la roncière. The 17-line cipher makes use of a popular set of cipher alphabet shapes known as a \"pigpen cipher \": - cleverly, de la roncière managed to decrypt this pigpen cipher without any difficulty … … though it turned out that de la roncière's solid-looking decryption revealed what can only be described as a rather jumbled french cleartext. Here is one version of many that are floating around the internet, with spaces guessed at to help make it a little more readable: - [ 1 ] - aprè jmez une paire de pijon tiresket [ 2 ] - 2 doeurs sqeseaj tête cheral funekort [ 3 ] - filttinshientecu prenez une cullière [ 4 ] - de mielle ef ovtre fous en faites une ongat [ 5 ] - mettez sur ke patai de la pertotitousn [ 6 ] - vpulezolvs prenez 2 let cassé sur le che [ 7 ] - min il faut qoe ut toit a noitie couue [ 8 ] - povr en pecger une femme dhrengt vous n",
            "According to legend, pirate treasure reportedly worth £ 100 million is buried on an indian ocean island. Although the region is thought to be littered with hidden treasure, this one is said to be the holy grail, the world's biggest booty haul. The story, which reads like a hollywood script, has been passed down through generations on the islands of the seychelles and la réunion. Although many have tried – and failed – to locate the bounty, two men have devoted their lives to the quest. Reginald herbert cruise-wilkins, known locally on the seychelles island of mahé as the 'treasure man ', hunted the fortune for 27 years until his death in 1977. His son john inherited both the nickname and the quest. When i first met john, he immediately barked that i was half an hour late. I didn't expect a warm welcome; john is constantly hounded by writers and locals who stop him wherever he is, asking if he is looking for buried treasure.

Authorities say morabito's use of his real name triggered a six-month investigation that ended with his arrest at a hotel in uruguay, the guardian reports. Morabito had apparently been living in the punta del este resort area since slipping into the country in 2002 using a fake brazilian passport with the name francisco capeletto. Authorities say morabito will be held in uruguay for at least three months for offenses including using false papers. After that, he is expected to be extradited to italy, where he has a 30-year prison sentence to serve. His wife, an angolan national, was also arrested. Morabito was a member of the ' ndrangheta crime gang, which controls much of the world's cocaine trade, reports the bbc. His lawyer says he has been leading a \" normal life \" since 1994, though a search of his possessions turned up 13 mobile phones, 12 bank cards, a 9mm pistol, $ 50,000 in cash, and another fake passport.

That remnant of tutankhamun is the only one of its kind known to exist outside egypt, and british experts decided to analyze it after stumbling upon a decades-old record by one of the archaeologists who found tut's tomb in 1922. That record indicated the body had been burnt, and a scanning electron microscope and chemical tests proved that was indeed the case, reports the independent. But here's the truly intriguing part: the body caught afire after it was sealed in its sarcophagus, essentially \" spontaneously combusting, \" says egyptologist chris nauton. The scientists'theory is that the mummification was bungled and that the body caught fire due to an unfortunate chemical reaction spurred by the combination of oxygen, embalming oils, and linen; the temperature would have reached 400 degrees fahrenheit. Raw story adds that the researchers also partnered with a team of car crash investigators whose computer simulations seem to verify the leading theory as to cause of death: a chariot accident. The injuries sustained on one side of his body ( as revealed by what the independent calls a \" virtual autopsy \" ) suggest a chariot crashed into tut while he was on his knees, crushing his heart. The findings will be presented in a documentary airing sunday in britain. Scientists believe tutankhamun may have fallen from the chariot while hunting.",

Erdogan's latest salvo takes aim at what he sees as a treasonous threat to his country: birth control. Erdogan made his statements at a wedding on sunday, advising the newly married couple to have at least three kids and blaming contraception supporters for keeping turkey down, the new york times reports. \" for years they committed a treason of birth control in this country, seeking to dry up our bloodline, \" he reportedly said in his speech. \" lineage is very important, both economically and spiritually. \" erdogan is nothing if not consistent: last month he told a women's conference that islam has \" defined a position for women: motherhood. \" he's also backed abortion restrictions and called for women to have at least three ( but preferably five ) kids. Women's rights advocates are fed up and say his attitude pushes women back down society's ladder. \" this is not just about the president interfering in people's private lives, \" ebru kazanc, a member of the platform to stop violence against women, tells the times. \" he is actively stalling the process for women to obtain equal rights in this country. \" she notes, however, that his inflammatory words are likely meant to distract from other issues, including former members of his cabinet on the docket to be possibly questioned about corruption allegations. ( meanwhile, turkey's deputy pm doesn't think women should laugh in public. )",

The parliamentary commission must decide whether or not to send the cases to the supreme council court, which only hears cases against cabinet ministers and other top officials. Its months-long deliberations were expected to end with a ruling monday but the decision was postponed until january 5, the official anatolia news agency reported. Former interior minister muammer guler, ex-environment minister erdogan bayraktar, ex-economy minister zafer caglayan and ex-eu affairs minister egemen bagis face accusations of bribery and influence-peddling. Caglayan was also accused of accepting a $ 300,000 ( 245,000 euro ) luxury watch to facilitate the smuggling of gold to iran in breach of international sanctions.

Shafeeq sheikh was instead sentenced to 10 years ' probation for the 2013 assault at ben taub hospital, the houston chronicle reports. Sheikh wasn't assigned to the woman's case, but entered the woman's room repeatedly after noticing her breast implants, jurors were told. Assistant da lauren reeder had urged the jury of five women and seven men to remember that sheikh used his position to sexually assault a vulnerable woman. \" he sought her out. He chose her to prey on, \" reeder said. Sheikh, who is married with children, claimed the encounter was consensual. The victim, who is now 32, testified that she was weak and tethered to machines when a doctor began touching her breasts during a chest exam. She said the doctor returned repeatedly overnight, raping her on the third visit, the ap reports. Witnesses confirmed that the button she had tried to use to call a nurse for help had been unplugged. Defense lawyer stanley schneider argued that sheikh, who was stripped of his medical license, had already been punished. \" the dreams of a man, the childhood dream to become a doctor, were shattered by his conduct, \" schneider said. \" he destroyed his own dreams. \" advocacy groups say they are stunned by the decision, which analysts say is unusually lenient, especially since doctors are usually held to a higher standard.",

After they landed back on the sas campus, company security officials alerted police to the incident, the washington post reported in february, when desgroux was indicted. Investigators suspected he was mentally ill and his attorney requested a psychological evaluation, the results of which are sealed. In the new court filings, desgroux's attorney says he is seeking his client's release pending sentencing, arguing that sentencing guidelines call for no more than six months and he has already been in custody for about five months. Desgroux, who has never actually served in the military, allegedly pulled the same helicopter-and-army-uniform scheme with another woman last year, the bbc reports.",

The supermodel says marciano's pattern of sexual assault and harassment, which photographer yu tsai confirms he witnessed, took place starting when she was 18 and working on the guess campaign, between 2010 and 2011. Among the incidents she describes is one in which she and marciano had a meeting ( with tsai present ) in which marciano grabbed her breasts to make \" sure they're real \" and kissed her face and neck. \" i had two options: do everything i could to wiggle away and avoid his pursuit, or punch the ceo of guess. So i decided to just wiggle away, \" she recalls, saying she didn't want to tell him to get off her because she feared he'd stick his tongue into her open mouth. She details other times in which marciano tried to visit her hotel room — she always refused — and sent her sexually charged texts. It was at a final shoot in may 2011 when upton says marciano finally booted her, saying, \" get that fat pig off my set. \" upton says that after the success of her sports illustrated cover, guess tried to coax her back for a campaign in 2012. She agreed to do it, hoping marciano would treat her better this time around, but marciano started texting her again as the shoot neared and so she turned down the job. \" paul used his power to make me feel insecure and powerless, but i ' m not going to let him intimidate me anymore, \" she says.

A houston couple have been charged with solicitation of capital murder in connection with an alleged plot to have both their exes killed. The chronicle reports veterinarian valerie mcdaniel, 48 and mother to an 8-year-old, and her live-in boyfriend, leon jacob, 39, appeared before a judge monday in the case. Mcdaniel's bail was set at $ 50,000; jacob was denied bail, because ( warning: convoluted ) he was already on bail, having been charged with stalking and assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Hence, in his case, the hitman, or so a probable cause statement cited by click2houston asserts: jacob \" says he was looking for somebody to kill a witness for his pending stalking charge. \" it's unclear why mcdaniel was allegedly targeting her ex, but the couple \" unwittingly... Of course end up with a hitman who's working for the houston pd, \" harris county assistant da tom berg tells ktrk. Prosecutors say police arranged for an undercover officer to pose as a hitman, and that at a meeting at olive garden the couple offered to pay $ 20,000 and two cartier watches. Mcdaniel's husband was allegedly to be killed in what was supposed to appear as a bungled carjacking; he and jacob's ex were alerted as to what was going on and agreed to pose for photographs that supposedly depicted their murder and kidnapping, respectively. Mcdaniel and jacob allegedly then forked over part of the payment, and were arrested on friday. Says berg of mcdaniel, \" it's unusual to find a person who is concerned about animals but is less concerned about humans. \" ( an unusual study zeroed in on what makes a good hit man. )",

        "summary": "After six years, the un has admitted it is at least partially responsible for the cholera outbreak ravaging haiti, the new york times reports. The epidemic started in 2010 near a base where un peacekeepers from nepal had just arrived. Nepal was experiencing an outbreak of cholera at the time, and waste from the base in haiti got into a nearby river. According to npr, experts hired by the un found the strain of cholera in haiti matched the one in nepal. And scientists agreed the base was the only realistic source of the outbreak. Regardless, the un continued to deny any responsibility as cholera killed at least 10,000 haitians and sickened hundreds of thousands more. The guardian puts those numbers even higher at 30,000 and 2 million respectively. On thursday, un secretary general ban ki-moon for the first time said the un played a role in the cholera outbreak and called for a \" significant new set of un actions to stop it. \" his spokesperson admitted some un \" involvement in the initial outbreak. \" this change in tack follows a confidential report from a un adviser that stated the cholera epidemic \" would not have broken out but for the actions of the united nations. \" still, the un resisted taking full responsibility for the outbreak and continued to insist it can't be held legally responsible. Studies show it would have cost the un as little as $ 2,000 to screen its peacekeepers for cholera and protect haitians, who have no immunity to cholera and were already dealing with a devastating earthquake.",

Chien's death has sparked a whole new debate in taiwan over animal euthanasia, which is about to be made illegal for strays there, and which chien fervently argued for to help put abandoned and unwanted pets out of their misery in a country replete with strays and low on shelter workers. Chien, said to be in her early 30s, had taken a lot of flak for her stance, especially after reports came out that she had euthanized 700 dogs or so over a two-year period. She was called all kinds of names — including \" butcher \" and \" beautiful slaughterer \" — and staff at her shelter didn't receive any kind of counseling after completing their sad job duties. In a tv interview for a local station, chien herself described the first time she saw an animal put to sleep. \" i went home and cried all night, \" she says. A note she penned before she died noted that she was overcome with emotion at having to euthanize so many strays. \" there is no less importance in the life of an animal than the life of a person, \" she wrote, per the washington post. The telegraph notes taiwan's government has said it wants to offer more funding for shelters and counseling for anyone who's helped put an animal to sleep.

        "summary": "After thursday's shocking turn in the case of four missing pennsylvania men — a confession — come more details from what cosmo dinardo allegedly admitted to doing. The admission came in exchange for prosecutors taking the death penalty off the table, and dinardo's lawyers did not provide motive or much in the way of details in making the announcement. Unnamed sources fill in some of the gaps: the ap refers to dinardo as a drug dealer and talks to a source who says, \" every death was related to a purported drug transaction, and at the end of each one there's a killing. \" as the ap puts it, dinardo allegedly felt \" cheated or threatened \" in the course of completing three drug sales, killed the men, and burned their bodies. A separate ap story quotes a source as saying dinardo sold pot by the quarter-pound. Both the ap and philadelphia inquirer's sources say a co-conspirator was involved in the deaths of at least three of the four men from bucks and montgomery counties: dean finocchiaro, 19; mark sturgis, 22; tom meo, 21; and jimi taro patrick, 19. The ap notes patrick had been in the grade below dinardo at a catholic high school for boys. Thus far, only finocchiaro's remains have been found in a 12-foot grave on the solebury township farm officials have been searching. More of dinardo's backstory is emerging: he spent time in a mental health facility and has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. A 2016 atv accident left him with a head injury. He attended arcadia university for one semester but sources say he has since been banned from the campus. District attorney matthew d. Weintraub is slated to hold a 11am news conference.",

Using a proprietary \" next-generation genomic sequencing workflow \" known as clear food, clear labs analyzed 345 hot dogs and sausages at the molecular level from 75 brands at 10 retailers, cbs news reports. The results showed 14.4 % of the meat was \" problematic, \" meaning a product either had a substituted ingredient that isn't on the food label, or a \" hygienic issue \" in which a \" non-harmful contaminant \" was found. On the substitution level, 10 % of vegetarian products in this category contained meat. On the non-harmful contaminant level, human dna ( yes, as in from people ) was found in 2 % of the samples tested — and in two-thirds of the vegetarian samples. Clear labs, which says its molecular database of 10,000 or so items is the largest on earth, wants to examine a different food category each month to fight food fraud, which the congressional research service says affects about 10 % of all commercially produced food, per the atlantic. \" we expected to find some deviations because it is a complex supply chain, but this is also about intentional adulteration for economic gain, which is basically fraud, \" a company co-founder tells the magazine about the hot dog results. Backers of clear foods ' kickstarter campaign will select each month's subject; eater notes upcoming categories could include sushi, wine, and gluten-free products. If you can't envision attending a baseball game without a kraut-covered frank, there's some good news: clear food says \" there are a number of hot dog manufacturers, large and small, that are producing high-quality hot dogs with integrity, \" including the butterball and hebrew national brands.

        "summary": "Jake gyllenhaal plays a prizefighter in southpaw, out this summer — and he went to great pains to bulk up for the role. He started with three hours of workouts per day and worked his way up to six hours a day; those workouts were split between boxing and strength training/conditioning/cardio. One example of his daily to-do list: he worked his way up to 2,000 sit-ups each day, half in the morning and half at night, his trainer tells yahoo news. Gyllenhaal had lost 30 pounds for last year's nightcrawler, so he had to get back to his normal weight and then add 15 pounds of muscle — plus he had to learn how to box — which explains why he trained for six full months before beginning filming. By the end, he was decent enough to spar with actual pros, though his trainer notes that they weren't exactly \" trying to take his head off. \" ( click for a slideshow of actors who've lost a lot of weight for their roles. )",

Lawyers, environmentalists and civil society groups are calling it a \" blatant violation \" of two international moratoria and the news is likely to spark outrage at a united nations environmental summit taking place in india this week. Satellite images appear to confirm the claim by californian russ george that the iron has spawned an artificial plankton bloom as large as 10,000 square kilometres. The intention is for the plankton to absorb carbon dioxide and then sink to the ocean bed – a geoengineering technique known as ocean fertilisation that he hopes will net lucrative carbon credits. George is the former chief executive of planktos inc, whose previous failed efforts to conduct large-scale commercial dumps near the galapagos and canary islands led to his vessels being barred from ports by the spanish and ecuadorean governments. The us environmental protection agency warned him that flying a us flag for his galapagos project would violate us laws, and his activities are credited in part to the passing of international moratoria at the united nations limiting ocean fertilisation experiments scientists are debating whether iron fertilisation can lock carbon into the deep ocean over the long term, and have raised concerns that it can irreparably harm ocean ecosystems, produce"

Lawyers, environmentalists and civil society groups are calling it a \" blatant violation \" of two international moratoria and the news is likely to spark outrage at a united nations environmental summit taking place in india this week. Satellite images appear to confirm the claim by californian russ george that the iron has spawned an artificial plankton bloom as large as 10,000 square kilometres. The intention is for the plankton to absorb carbon dioxide and then sink to the ocean bed – a geoengineering technique known as ocean fertilisation that he hopes will net lucrative carbon credits. George is the former chief executive of planktos inc, whose previous failed efforts to conduct large-scale commercial dumps near the galapagos and canary islands led to his vessels being barred from ports by the spanish and ecuadorean governments. The us environmental protection agency warned him that flying a us flag for his galapagos project would violate us laws, and his activities are credited in part to the passing of international moratoria at the united nations limiting ocean fertilisation experiments scientists are debating whether iron fertilisation can lock carbon into the deep ocean over the long term, and have raised concerns that it can irreparably harm ocean ecosystems, produce"

The interactive episodes will also only be available, to start, on certain devices including game consoles, ios devices, roku devices, and some modern smart tvs. They won't yet be available on android devices, apple tv, chromecast, or the web. \" kids are already talking to the screen, \" netflix's director of product innovation explains to the verge. \" they're touching every screen.

The shortest path through the choices is 12 minutes; the longest in puss is 39 minutes. In buddy, there's an \" infinitely looping narrative \" created by one of the choices. Kids can go back and rewatch the episodes to make different choices and ultimately experience all the possible endings. The interactive puss episode launched wednesday; the buddy episode is out july 14, per digital trends. ( netflix subscribers are angry about this show's cancellation. )",

But as the bbc explains, it's no joke. It seems the seventh planet from the sun does indeed smell like rotten eggs. Scientists figured this out using the spectrometer on the gemini north telescope — they found that the planet's clouds are made up mostly of the smelly gas hydrogen sulfide. The discovery, reported in nature astronomy, should help astronomers better understand the formation not only of uranus but of the other outer planets. For one thing, uranus differs from gas giants jupiter and saturn, whose clouds are made up mostly of ammonia ice ( and are thus less smelly ). \" if an unfortunate human were to ever descend through uranus ' clouds, they would be met with very unpleasant and odiferous conditions, \" says study co-author patrick irwin of the university of oxford in a news release. Not that they'd live long enough to sniff it: \" suffocation and exposure in the ( minus 328 degrees fahrenheit ) atmosphere made of mostly hydrogen, helium and methane would take its toll long before the smell. \" it's likely that neptune's clouds are similar to uranus ' clouds in makeup, given that those two planets formed farther from the sun than jupiter and saturn, notes space.com.

In an article in studies in contemporary history, harriet scharnberg says that due to this arrangement during the 1930s and up through 1941 — which the guardian paints as a \" presumably profitable situation of being the prime channel for news reports and pictures out of the totalitarian state \" — the nazis were able to \" portray a war of extermination as a conventional war. \" she adds that, as part of an \" editor's law \" the agency agreed to, the nazis even embedded one of their own with the ap as a photographer and pulled photos from ap archives for their anti-semitic propaganda. In a statement, the ap says it \" rejects \" this notion of nazi collaboration, instead noting the \" pressure \" the agency faced in dealing with the third reich. \" ap staff resisted the pressure while doing its best to gather accurate, vital and objective news for the world in a dark and dangerous time, \" it says. Scharnberg's claims are raising speculation about the ap's current relationships with totalitarian regimes, including north korea. The guardian points out that the ap was the first western news agency to start a bureau there, yet didn't cover significant events, including an mia kim jong un in 2014 and the sony hack that november. The ap denies censorship there, too, but an ex-ap reporter in cambodia tells the guardian, \" to claim, as the agency does, that north korea does not control their output is ludicrous. \" ( the nazis had exploding candy bars. )",

That's because a black widow spider was lurking inside the bag, per the 21-year-old's mother; the mother says the spider made its way up her daughter's arm and bit her. A nurse tells wptz it was indeed a black spider, and the hospital apparently had more than bite marks to go off of: the women captured the spider and brought it with them to the er. The grapes were purchased from a shaw's in colchester. It's a bit of deja vu for the grocer. Wptz reports a shopper at a williston, vermont, shaw's also inadvertently picked up a black widow in 2004. How shaw's is responding: with a thorough inspection of the grapes in all its stores. It has also replaced all the food in the family's fridge. As for the woman, wcax reports she was given a series of shots and is \" ok, \" though she ' ll be monitored for months. Wptz spoke with a biologist at the university of vermont who had something less-than-reassuring to say about the spiders: \" there are areas that have black widows very commonly inside houses.... They are often common inside of houses but they very rarely bite. \" national geographic seems to back that up, describing the spiders as \" nonagressive \" and resorting to biting only as a means of defense, \" such as when someone accidentally sits on them. \" ( scientists recently figured out how black widows became so deadly. )",

It reveals the us saw a record number of new cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis for the second year in a row in 2016, reports the los angeles times. New chlamydia cases were up 5 % over 2015 to 1.6 million. But especially concerning was the 18.5 % climb to 470,000 gonorrhea cases, given the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains, says the cdc's gail bolan. Cases of syphilis, once thought to be nearly eradicated in the us, likewise climbed 17.5 % to 28,000, while cases of congenital syphilis were up nearly 28 % to 628 cases, resulting in more than 40 newborn deaths, reports cnn. That alone represents \" an unconscionable situation in america today, \" david harvey of the national coalition of std directors tells cnn. But syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea are only part of the problem. It's estimated that 20 million new cases of stds, including hiv and herpes, appear in the us each year, half in those aged 15 to 24. Harvey blames \" funding cutbacks for prevention, education and healthcare programs … particularly from this administration, \" though the data comes from 2016, as well as dating apps. The fact that many stds present no symptoms is another issue, says bolan. \" we need every community in america to be aware that this risk is out there, \" she adds, noting, \" everyone needs a yearly checkup. \"",

            "President obama's reelection campaign is reinventing itself as a political organization to support his policy aims. ( brendan smialowski, afp/getty images / ) washington — as he launches his second term, president obama may get help from an ambitious new political organization being built out of his reelection campaign, a group that could reshape how future presidents harness supporters to press their white house agendas. Run by former obama campaign officials, the advocacy group will seek to leverage the campaign's sophisticated organizing tools and rich voter database to support the president's policy objectives, including raising the debt ceiling, gun control and immigration reform. If it is able to sustain the passion that propelled obama twice into the white house, the pro-obama group may outstrip the role played by traditional interest groups, from organized labor to the environmental movement, and could form an independent power base outside the white house and the democratic party. \" this just dwarfs any part of the democratic coalition, \" said democratic strategist joe trippi. \" this is the biggest leg of the stool.

        "summary": "Britain's official titanic inquiry has already been called a \" whitewash \" — but was it a conspiracy of freemasons? a recently revealed list of two million freemasons shows that members of their fraternity played a big role in the controversial investigation, the telegraph reports. On the list are john bigham, who oversaw the probe; sydney buxton, then president of the british board of trade; and at least two of five experts used in the inquiry. Lord pirrie, who was chairman of the shipyard that built the titanic and a director of the parent company that owned the ship's white star line, also apparently was a freemason. \" the titanic inquiry in britain was branded a ' whitewash ' because it exonerated most of those involved, \" says titanic expert nic compton. The probe interviewed only three passengers, compton says, and even the ship's captain got off on the argument that ships at the time broke through ice at full throttle. A us senate inquiry, however, criticized the white star line and accused the british board of trade of having far too few lifeboats on board — while the uk probe didn't censure the board of trade. Posted on ancestry.com, the freemason list contains thousands of influential names including statesmen, police, lawyers, and authors, and could force a reassessment of british history, the telegraph says. There are said to be roughly 6 million freemasons alive today, with a third of them living in the us, reports the mirror, which runs through some high-profile members of the past. ( the new list includes jack the ripper candidate michael maybrick, whose identity may have been hidden by fellow masons ).",

        "summary": "Either president trump is about to get tough on china over trade or the white house wants beijing to think he's about to get tough on trade. The white house is putting the word out that the president thinks china is ripping off american businesses and aims to take legal action to protect intellectual property rights, with outlets including the new york times, politico, and axios quoting sources to that effect. The gist of the stories is that trump has been holding back on such a move because he's been seeking china's help on reining in north korea. But with little progress on that front, trump is ready to act, perhaps as early as this week. Specifically, he would direct us trade representative robert lighthizer to open an investigation against beijing under section 301 of the trade act of 1974, per politico. As the times notes, this would come as china has unveiled ambitious plans to be a world leader in fields such as driverless cars, artificial intelligence, and robotics by 2025. China also has been pressuring us companies to cut licensing fees, share technology, and set up chinese outposts if they want to do business there. Long before he became president, trump had been criticizing china for dealing unfairly with us companies, notes axios. In fact, he \" has been more rhetorically consistent on this issue than on any other he's talked about in his decades in the public eye, \" writes jonathan swan. The upshot could be stiff tariffs on chinese products and an escalation of tensions between the two nations. One big question still unanswered is whether the us would act on its own or go through the world trade organization, reports the wall street journal.",

But the tiny beetle smaller than a penny quickly proved to be invasive here, where ash trees have not evolved to protect themselves from its ravenous appetite — it's claimed 30 million trees across 26 states and counting, reports afp. The situation is so dire it's \" bordering on catastrophic, \" one michigan scientist tells npr, which profiles the bug's impact on the rawlings plant in new york state, where iconic rawlings baseball bats have been made for more than a century. Most of those are made of ash, which sluggers like because they don't shatter as easily as bats of other wood. \" if the ash borer is not controlled, it ' ll wipe out the entire species of white ash, \" plant manager vander groef says. The problem is that figuring out remedies is still in the early stages, and he predicts the plant's ash supply will be gone or unaffordable in three years. The us forest service has equally grim news, saying few if any ash trees will survive in infested areas and labeling the beetle \" the most devastating forest insect to reach north america in modern times. \" a new pesticide may help attack the beetle's larvae, but it's expensive and likely not fast enough. St. Louis, for example, is preparing to cut down almost all of the city's 14,000 ash trees, or 17 % of the city's tree population. \" we really have no other choice, \" says a forestry official.

Nine people were hospitalized, and the violence stirred outrage online as critics of recep tayyip erdogan accused him of bringing his oppressive tactics against dissent to the us. A new video won't help. It shows erdogan surveying the violent scene with aides upon exiting a car, reports the new york times. Perhaps worse is a chain of events laid out on twitter by washington post reporter philip bump. As bump puts it, it \" looks like erdogan telling his goons to assault peaceful protesters in america. \" before erdogan emerges from the car, an aide ducks his head in, then pops out and speaks to another man, who heads toward the protesters. Within seconds, the violence breaks out. Bump writes that the video of erdogan could \" raise the stakes \" in the controversy. The white house has been silent on the protest and violence, though a state department spokesperson said that \" violence is never an appropriate response to free speech, \" and that those concerns would be relayed to turkey's government \" in the strongest possible way, \" per the voice of america. Turkey, for its part, denies any role in inciting violence.

Police administered breathalyzer tests to partygoers, who ranged in age from 17 to 20, as they left the frat, wjz reports. A number of them apparently told police they would never attend another frat party. Six 20-year-olds living at the house were arrested and charged with 126 counts each of allowing underage possession of alcohol and furnishing alcohol to a minor.

Although lochte says he was robbed at gunpoint in a taxi over the weekend with olympic teammates gunnar bentz, jack conger, and jimmy feigen, the story got weird when a brazilian judge first ordered the confiscation of lochte's and feigen's passports ( lochte had already gone back to the us ), then brazilian authorities removed conger and bentz from a plane back to the states; feigen is still reportedly in brazil and also being grilled by authorities. The reason for these developments may now be coming to light: a brazilian police source tells abc news that surveillance video exists showing \" one of the swimmers \" busting down a bathroom door at a rio gas station and getting into an altercation with a security guard. The bbc notes inconsistencies in the swimmers'stories, including lochte initially saying the taxi was pulled over by the alleged robbers ( he then changed it to say the taxi was parked at the gas station when they were robbed ), while surveillance footage obtained by the daily mail appears to show the swimmers returning to the olympic village after the supposed robbery and running their valuables — which would have ostensibly been taken if they were robbed — through a metal detector. Meanwhile, ioc spokesman mario andrada issued thursday what yahoo sports calls a \" strange statement \" about the incident, which deadspin says is now reaching \" full-on scandal levels \": \" let's give these kids a break.

Following a recent case in which amazon handed over data from its echo device to police investigating a murder, a smart device called the police when a couple was allegedly involved in a violent domestic dispute. [ see correction below ] according to abc news, officers were called to a home outside albuquerque, new mexico this week when a smart device called 911 and the operator heard a confrontation in the background. Police say that eduardo barros was house-sitting at the residence with his girlfriend and their daughter. Barros allegedly pulled a gun on his girlfriend when they got into an argument and asked her: \"did you call the sheriffs? \" a smart device in the home apparently heard \"call the sheriffs, \" and proceeded to call the sheriffs. Advertisement a swat team arrived at the home and after negotiating for hours, they were able to take barros into custody. Police tell abc news that the man's girlfriend was injured but did not need to visit a hospital. The couple's daughter was safe and unharmed. \"the unexpected use of this new technology to contact emergency services has possibly helped save a life, \" bernalillo county sheriff manuel gonzales iii said in a statement. Barros was charged with possession of a firearm or destructive device",
            "In millions of homes across the country, amazon's voice-controlled personal assistant, alexa, is listening. And whether you want to or not, she's ready to play. According to san diego's xetv-tdt, the trouble started on thursday, when the station aired a story about a 6-year-old girl who reportedly bought a $ 170 dollhouse by asking her family's alexa-enabled amazon echo, \"can you play dollhouse with me and get me a dollhouse? \" \"i loved the little girl's take on it, \" said anchor jim patton at the time. \"'alexa ordered me a dollhouse. ' \" that, apparently, was enough to prompt complaints from viewers \"all over san diego, \" who claimed their own alexa devices tried to place orders for dollhouses in response. While echo devices have voice ordering turned on by default, amazon noted in response to the initial story that it can be turned off in alexa's settings or protected with a confirmation code. The company also offered free returns on any accidental physical order. Advertisement currently, alexa doesn't have a voice recognition system to identify whether the speaker is an authorized user. When it comes to a children pursuing their desires, however, there may not be any system secure enough. Just last month, another 6-year-old placed her sleeping mother"

        "summary": "The canadian scientist who became the first female nobel laureate for physics since 1963 didn't have a wikipedia page until after winning the prize tuesday. Per quartz, university of waterloo professor donna strickland's groundbreaking work in the field of laser technology, which won her the prize, wasn't deemed significant enough to merit her own page. That all changed with the announcement of her win, 90 minutes after which her new page emerged as one among the just 17 % of biographical wikipedia entries that are about women. Meanwhile, vox notes that one of strickland's co-winners, french scientist gérard mourou, has had an entry since as far back as 2005. Further fueling speculation that strickland's gender had a little or a lot to do with her lack of prior recognition, fortune notes another point of contention that grabbed the attention of the social media commentariat: her academic title. Though the work she co-authored with mourou helped revolutionize laser technology, strickland currently holds the relatively lowly title of associate professor. Unwilling to enter the fray, however, was strickland herself. She told the bbc she's always been treated as an equal to her male counterparts and that she has just never applied to become a full professor. ( one of this year's winners of the prize in chemistry told the ap he's confident more women will receive the honor in his field in years to come. )",

But attracting far more attention is that jeff sessions laughed along as the high school students in the audience began chanting, \" lock her up \" in reference to hillary clinton — and then repeated the line himself. Politico sees it as a \" remarkable \" utterance from the nation's top law enforcement officer, though not all coverage was as concerned with it. A story on the speech by fox news, for example, doesn't mention it. The chant began amid sessions ' ridicule of \" supercilious snowflakes \" on college campuses at the turning point usa high school leadership summit. \" i like this bunch, i gotta tell ya, you're not going to be backing down. Go get ' em! go get ' em! \" he told the group. The chant then began, and sessions, chuckling, repeated the line once himself, adding, \" i heard that a long time over the last campaign. \" the right-wing site twitchy rounds up outraged reaction from \" twitter libs, \" including former obama adviser dan pfeiffer, who said session should resign immediately. \" wait a second, \" points out twitchy. \" isn't this exactly what donald trump wants to happen, which could then trigger the end of the mueller investigation? \" ( before sessions spoke, nikki haley had a much different message to the group: enough with trying to \" own the libs \" in public discourse, she urged. )",

The travel editor \" scoffed \" at people who traded their seats for cash from the airline. \" not my thing, \" she writes at forbes. But then a weekend trip to florida went awry — and bloom made a cool $ 11,000. The saga unfolded on friday morning as bloom and her husband and daughter waited to board a delta flight at new york's laguardia airport. Bad weather had caused thousands of flight cancellations, but the storms had passed so bloom didn't expect a problem. Wrong. With 60 standby passengers, delta began offering deals, and bloom's family got $ 4,050 for agreeing to fly saturday night. The family arrived for that flight, only to learn delta was begging for volunteers to bump, and the price kept rising. \" cha-ching! \" bloom writes, pocketing another $ 1,300 each, plus lunch ( $ 15 each ), and $ 50 taxi fare. Although she \" felt a bit guilty \" for playing the system, bloom says \" many passengers actually thanked us for doing this. \" but as they waited for confirmed seats on sunday, the family learned florida flights were overbooked through tuesday. Goodbye weekend trip. Hello windfall. An offer to give up their seats again was \" met with smiles and another $ 1,000 per passenger, \" plus a refund of their original fares. It all added up to about $ 11,000, and bloom is \" already starting to think \" how she can get bumped from future flights. Her post ends with 10 tips for others in a similar mindset. As for the delta woes, cnn takes a look at what triggered the \" five-day meltdown \" that caused the airline to cancel 3,500 flights from wednesday through sunday. Factors include severe weather, the bad timing of spring break, and, ironically, a company mindset that resists canceling flights under most circumstances.

            "After years of profitability and reliable service, delta air lines struggled mightily last week with two basic functions of its business -- flying airplanes and accommodating passengers. Severe weather that pounded atlanta in the middle of spring break caused a five-day meltdown across delta's flight network, leaving passengers fuming and its own crews waiting for instructions. The weather is, of course, out of delta's control. But the chaos was amplified by the phenomenal complexity of running a modern-day mega-airline, according to interviews with delta pilots, flight attendants and other staffers. The episode was out of character for america's second-biggest carrier. Its chief operating officer, gil west, apologized and said the recovery from the storm had \" not been ideal. \" delta canceled more than 3,500 flights from wednesday through sunday. By monday, the airline was getting back to normal, a spokesman said, but the effects of the storms still lingered. Storms early in the week had left delta vulnerable, but wednesday brought the wildest weather. High wind and hail hit the southeast -- hundreds of reports in all, including tornadoes. The ramp at atlanta's hartsfield-jackson international airport, delta's home base, closed five separate times after seven rounds of thunderstorms rolled through.

Their purpose, once essential to the state's economic life, came to be considered \" almost like a criminal activity, \" an expert tells the deseret news. In the late 1800s these huts were charcoal kilns, where forested trees were slowly heated in a week-long process that created charcoal packed with energy. Mostly it was used to smelt metals from mines, a process dating back 6,000 years or more. \" without metals you wouldn't have had an industrial age; and without charcoal, you wouldn't have metals, \" says a retired forest official who wants the kilns protected as historic sites. Yet the kilns had a downside: vast deforestation. \" a lot of times it was ' exploit the area and move on, ' \" says archaeologist nate thomas. Most kilns lasted just a few years before running out of wood, and \" by the end it was almost considered like a criminal activity. \" some still say the kilns were necessary for economic progress, but thomas believes they carry a lesson: \" take what you can but never take everything if you want to keep a forest out there, \" he says. \" leave something for the future. \" it isn't just a historical issue, either: in somalia, kiln-made charcoal not only leads to wide deforestation and desertification, it's a business that allows the militant group al-shabab to siphon off tens of millions of dollars a year, the economist reports.

A thin boy scurries from table to table with a bucket of hot coals. Those enjoying such evening idylls may not know it, but their love of smoking shisha is fuelling a bloody insurgency more than 3,000km ( 1,864 miles ) to the south, in somalia. The production and export of charcoal is an unlikely but important source of revenue for the shabab, a militant group that rules swathes of somalia and has been battling against troops from the african union and the fragile somali government. Charcoal made from somali acacia trees is particularly prized in the gulf, because it burns longer than alternatives from, say, sudan or nigeria. This quality comes at a price: somali charcoal retails for about 15 dirham a kilogram ( $ 1.85 per lb ), compared with about 9 dirham for the inferior stuff.

Megan phelps-roper, a prominent member of the group who found herself in the news more than once, has left the church her grandfather founded. Younger sister grace went with her. Phelps-roper, credited with getting the wbc onto social media, had been silent on twitter for months before posting a link to an open letter yesterday. In the letter, she admits: \" we know that we've done and said things that hurt people. Inflicting pain on others wasn't the goal, but it was one of the outcomes. We wish it weren't so, and regret that hurt. \" she promises to \" try to find a better way to live from here on. \" she also says they still love their family ( the girls have nine more siblings ), but have been cut off from them as \" betrayers. \" jeff chu offers some background on the situation on medium.com: megan, 27, left the church in november.

An fbi file? yep, a file was opened into john wilkes booth in 1922 and was still active as late as 1977, smithsonian reports. The blog wonders &amp; marvels got hold of the file, and shares some highlights. The file was started when a missourian wrote bureau director william j. Burns saying that booth — rumored by some to still be alive — was either the man's neighbor or corresponding with his neighbor. Burns replied that he believed the \" official records \" and saw no need for further action. Yet another letter the following year prompted burns to read a book about booth's alleged escape, and burns found that it had \" very strong evidence in support of the old belief that booth did escape and live many years. \" ( still, there's no evidence of burns following up on it. ) in 1948, the fbi received the boot booth wore when he killed lincoln ( a doctor removed it from his injured left leg ), but an ultraviolet and infrared examination of writing in the boot couldn't make heads or tails of it. Finally, in 1977, the fbi scanned booth's diary in search of invisible writing, and couldn't find any. The fbi did confirm what had been known since 1867, though: twenty-seven sheets were missing from it. The diary can still be seen at ford's theatre museum. ( in other lincoln news, a report found in a box at the national archives in 2012 revealed how the first doctor to reach the shot president reacted. )",

I have that experience almost every time i browse fbi files on notable people and events. Over the years, in response to freedom of information act requests, the fbi has publicly released its files on a marvelous assortment of deceased people of celebrity, infamy, and importance. On my personal blog, i've written about the fbi file on the actress carole lombard and the agency's investigation of the world war ii air crash that killed her, as well as the file on architect frank lloyd wright and his tangles with the government. These files reveal as much about the worldview and techniques of the fbi as they do of the lives of their subjects. I recently learned that john wilkes booth, who assassinated abraham lincoln in 1865, is the subject of another bulky fbi file, which is surprising because the fbi did not come into existence until six decades after booth's crime and death. What could possibly be in a file compiled so long after lincoln's assassination? did booth elude capture? the oldest pages of the file discuss the possibility that booth escaped capture after he shot lincoln.
