Only 2,200 lacked power later on, but gale warnings are in effect until 10pm, and authorities have raised barricades along lake shore drive to keep joggers and cyclists away, says the chicago sun-times. A news helicopter recorded several people who ignored the warnings and tumbled in the waves, msnbc reports. No injuries were reported. A cold front crept in yesterday and triggered the gale warning, which stretches along lake michigan from the illinois-wisconsin border to indiana. The national weather service warns that winds could reach 50mph and cause 25-foot waves. Winds have reached 49mph in chicago, knocking bricks off a house facade onto cars, and 60mph in nearby michigan city, indiana. Rain also battered the area, hitting chicago with 2.5 inches over the past 5 days — equivalent to 75 % of its average september rainfall.",

The attorney also asks why frasier, 30, was jailed on charges of driving without a license plate or insurance, which rarely warrant jail time. But a denver police technician says the arresting officer didn't know frasier had shot the video. \" this isn't a revenge thing, \" the technician says. The story dates back to august, when frasier used his tablet to film an officer punching a drug suspect in the face so he would spit up a sock-full of heroin. The officer also tripped the suspect's pregnant girlfriend, reports fox 31, which broke the story. Frasier claims that the officer seized the tablet and handed it back with the video missing. Frasier later recovered the video from the cloud and gave it to reporters ( see it here, but be warned of violence ). Denver police responded with a four-page letter, saying the officer punched the suspect to prevent him from choking, and pushed the girlfriend when she tried to intervene. The letter also says frasier told police that he supported the officer's use of force, and had himself served \" a lengthy sentence for numerous charges \" including breaking-and-entering and home invasion. A citizen oversight board appointed by the mayor criticized denver police, saying they \" publicly attacked [ frasier's ] character \" and likely scared off others from cooperating with police in the future. Internal affairs and fbi investigations are underway.",

Of course, that logic seems less assailable given that the game itself was essentially over on the first play of the second half, making viewing optional if you really gave a damn about who wins. The level of perceived creativity in super bowl advertising has taken on a life of its own, which has led to the content generally being overrated. Moreover, one of the biggest sponsor categories — movie studios — are invariably challenged to come up with genuinely breakthrough creative, since a trailer is pretty much a trailer, the only difference here being the size of the stage and cost of the platform.

Included among them was jags owner shahid khan, who locked arms with tight end mercedes lewis and linebacker telvin smith in an unprecedented show of unity with his team. Khan was one of seven owners to donate $ 1 million to president donald trump's inauguration festivities. Khan later released a statement explaining his action: \"it was a privilege to stand on the sidelines with the jacksonville jaguars today for the playing of the u.s. National anthem at wembley stadium. I met with our team captains prior to the game to express my support for them, all nfl players and the league following the divisive and contentious remarks made by president trump, and was honored to be arm in arm with them"

        "summary": "\" alabama's women wrote the verdict on roy moore, \" declares an nbc news headline, with the accompanying story pointing out that 58 % of women voted for doug jones in alabama. But a deeper look at the numbers reveals that headline is missing a word: black. As the washington post reports, 63 % of white women voted for moore; only 2 % of black women, who made up 17 % of voters, did. And the black turnout was strong, with african-americans making up as much as 30 % of voters, compared to 29 % and 28 % during the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections; that figure is a bit higher than the state's black population, which abc news puts at 26.8 %. Slate's takeaway for dems: \" mobilizing black voters in conservative states en masse may be more possible than many imagined — even for candidates not named barack obama. \" how five black women responded to the news on twitter: @austinchanning: \" thank black women by supporting black women. Pay us. Vote with us. Hire us. Read our writing. Fund our projects and ministries. Vote us into office. Purchase from our businesses. Amplify us. Stand against racism and sexism. \" @kdc: \" like i don't think people get that black women don't turn out because of some maternal instinct to save everyone. We get usually hit first and worst by oppressive policies so we are saving ourselves. You just benefit. \" @rdp: \" icymi: 97 percent of black women voted for jones while 65 percent of white women voted for moore. We won't always be there to clean up the mess. \" @raquelwillis_: \" the real tea is black women saved themselves not y ' all. \" @charlenecac: \" black women are not political mules to be used every time a mediocre white candidate needs to win. No amount of verbal appreciation will do us justice. Turn over the money, resources and power, then we can talk. \"",

In digging up the floor of a garage at the center of the case, detectives on monday found bone fragments, some charred, and they're having them tested to see if they might have belonged to the mother of four, the albuquerque journal news reports. Detective robert garcia jr. Says he was fascinated by the case when it was mentioned by a colleague. \" i thought, 'why not? ' maybe i could bring a little closure. \" stories of garcia's disappearance are mysterious and varied. A 1954 news article said she'd spent a drunken night \" aloof from the crowd \" at a bar; she then spoke to a stranger before disappearing. Other accounts held that she suddenly fled from her car on a night out with her husband. The husband, juan andres jose garcia, was a top suspect in the case and arrested several times, the santa fe new mexican notes. He was, however, never tried. \" there were lots of rumors that he buried her in the dirt floor \" of the garage at the family's former home, says a police rep. \" nobody was allowed in here when he was alive. \" he's now deceased but remains a person of interest; the bones will next go to a texas lab.

Advocates of hb 0615 insist it doesn't violate either federal or state constitutional mandates on the separation of church and state, mainly because they're basing their nomination not on the bible's religious import, but on its historical, cultural, and even financial significance ( npr notes the state's multimillion-dollar bible-printing industry ). \" this book has done more to bring us to where we are today than any other book in the history of mankind, \" argued republican sen. Kerry roberts, who said he was initially conflicted about whether to vote for the bill ( he did ). What held him, and some others, back: the idea of the bible being trivialized next to other state symbols — including a barrett m82 sniper rifle and a state song about two guys looking for moonshine, per the ap. \" i hear satan snickering, \" senate majority leader mark norris noted last year, adding it would \" dumb the good book down, \" per the times free press. The director of aclu-tennessee tells the tennessean that \" privileging one religion over another not only tramples on the constitution, it marginalizes the tens of thousands of tennesseans who choose to practice other religions or not to practice religion at all. \" haslam has signaled his own reservations. \" the bible is the most important book in my life, and i think in the world, \" he told reporters last week, the ap notes. \" but that's very different than being the state's official book. \" he has 10 days to sign the bill or veto it once he receives it; if he does neither, it automatically becomes law.

The 59-year-old — who alternated mainstream fiction books with sci-fi novels written as iain m. Banks — was widely seen as one of the best british writers of his generation and tributes have poured in from around the literary world, the guardian reports. In his writing, banks \" brought a wonderful combination of the dark and the light side of life, and he explored them both without flinching, \" says fellow author ken macleod. Banks died days before the release of his final novel, the quarry.

        "summary": "Guards are accused in roughly half of all prison sex assaults, yet they almost never face charges for them, according to a grim new justice department survey of prison administrators. There were 8,000 sexual abuse reports logged between 2009 and 2011, the report says, an 11 % increase from the previous two years, although that might just be a sign of better reporting. Roughly 90 % of those are dismissed as \" unfounded \" or \" unsubstantiated, \" pro publica reports. Even among the handful of officially substantiated cases, fewer than half of the accused guards were prosecuted, and only 1 % were convicted. About a third were allowed to resign before the investigation finished, leaving no record that would prevent them from getting another job. Another 22 % did not lose their job at all, the washington times reports. Perhaps that's why assaults appear to be grossly under-reported. A survey that polled inmates directly last year estimated that more than 80,000 had been assaulted over a two-year span. \" it's a big deal for an inmate to file a report, especially if it's against staff, \" said one prison activist. \" they have to have some sense that something will come out of it, and there ' ll be no retaliation. \"",

Correctional facilities in 2011 were aimed at prison guards or staff, according to a report released thursday by the justice department's bureau of justice statistics.

But the challenge for officials is sorting through cases in which evidence indicates the commission of a crime and those in which prisoners may have been motivated solely by a desire to harm guards they don't like — a concern corrections unions have raised for years. The report found that only about 10 percent of reported sexual assaults in prison could be substantiated. Among the accused perpetrators, less than half were prosecuted and 22 percent remained in their jobs, the report said. \"an inmate is just as threatened by staff as … by other inmates — this wasn't the prevalent thought just a few years ago, \" said jamie fellner, who served on the national rape elimination commission that was created by congress to better understand the dynamics of sexual assaults behind bars.

The mothers against senseless killings volunteers organized by tamar manasseh worked on the premise that even those dead-set on wreaking havoc \" would not shoot under the glare of a motherly eye — let alone 15 sets of maternal eyes, \" as dnainfo put it. And since barnes'shooting, there have been no shootings in the englewood neighborhood on that block or the 7500 block of south harvard, where the \" army of moms \" has also set up shop, dnainfo reports. But manasseh says while initial reaction to her group — described on its website as a \" supplemental force to the police and other law enforcement agencies \" — was strong, it has since started to fade. \" people's attention spans are short. \" she says she underestimated local teens ( about two dozen have offered their help ) and is disappointed by a lack of adult support. \" the kids are not the problem, the guns aren't even the problem. The problem is really adult involvement. \" she tells fox 32. And part of the issue is that adults with \" good \" kids may not want to be bothered. \" but your kids are going to grow up in the world alongside those very kids that you tried to shield them from, \" she says. \" wouldn't it be better if you tried to save them all instead of just yours? \"",

        "summary": "Are nonaddictive cigarettes the future of smoking? the fda on thursday made its first move to reduce the nicotine in cigarettes to \" minimally addictive or nonaddictive \" levels, npr reports. According to the washington post, the fda was given the power to regulate tobacco in 2009 and first announced plans to reduce nicotine content in july. Now the agency is reviewing current research on nicotine and addiction while accepting public comments on possible nicotine cap levels and implementations, the wall street journal reports. \"we're taking a pivotal step today that could ultimately bring us closer to our vision of a world where combustible cigarettes would no longer create or sustain addiction, \" the post quotes fda commissioner scott gottlieb as saying. In its announcement, the fda cited new data from the new england journal of medicine that found capping nicotine levels in cigarettes could help 5 million adult smokers quit the habit within a year. The research found that by the year 2100 nicotine caps could reduce smoking rates from 15 % to 1.4 %, saving 8 million lives. While the fda hasn't said what the maximum nicotine content for cigarettes would be, the research it cited advocated for a reduction from 1.1 to 1.7 milligrams per cigarette to 0.3 to 0.5 milligrams. So far, the tobacco industry is keeping calm. \" as this process gets underway, we look forward to working with fda on its science-based review of nicotine levels in cigarettes, \" npr quotes an executive at rj reynolds tobacco company as saying.",

They left singapore, but authorities scooped them up in malaysia, which extradited them, according to media reports cited by the ap. Singapore is well known for its rigid vandalism laws, notes the bbc, and there have been a couple of high-profile cases of foreigners being caned. Perhaps the most famous: american teenager michael fay, who received four lashes for vandalism in 1994, per the new york times at the time. Fay's caning — which he described to the times as being between \" a few drops [ of blood and ] blood … gushing out. … it's like a bloody nose \" — invited condemnation for the singapore practice from human rights groups worldwide. The german men's lawyer sought a five-month sentence, per the local. \" i believe they deeply regret their crime, \" he said, mentioning that family had sent money to the transit company to pay for damages ( the check was reportedly returned ). \" this is the darkest episode of my entire life. I want to apologize to the state of singapore for the stupid act. … i've learned my lesson and will never do it again, \" von knorre told the court, per reuters; hinz offered a similar-sounding apology.

        "summary": "Tests conducted on the aloe vera gels sold by some of america's biggest retailers failed to detect any trace of the ingredient you would most expect to find in a product calling itself aloe vera gel. Bloomberg says the lab it hired to test aloe vera products from walmart, target, and cvs couldn't find the three chemical markers associated with the plant, but it did find maltodextrin, a much cheaper product sometimes used in place of genuine aloe. Tests on aloe vera gel from another retailer, walgreens, found just one of the markers, malic acid, which experts say isn't enough to confirm the presence of the plant. The products all listed the plant at the no. 1 or no. 2 ingredient, after water. The fda has never levied a fine for using fake aloe, putting retailers on what bloomberg calls an \" honor system. \" aloe gel supplier fruit of the earth has disputed the finding, and cvs and walmart both say they are standing by their suppliers. Target declined to comment, citing pending lawsuits, one of which states: \" no consumer would have purchased the product had they known it contained no aloe vera, \" per cbs news. Aloe vera has been used as an ointment for thousand of years. Joe barrie of aloecorp, one of the the biggest suppliers of aloe vera powder, tells bloomberg that some competitors are selling for half of his lowest price, suggesting that what they're selling isn't aloe. He says it can take more than 200 pounds of aloe leaves to make a single pound of the powder. \" aloe is all harvested by hand, \" he says. \" it's an involved process and it's not cheap. \" ( a study of herbal supplements found a disturbing lack of herbs. )",

Bader won with a $ 30 million jump for his final bid. The washington post notes that one of the things that makes the buy surprising is the fact that the painting is of jesus. He is considered a prophet in islam, and most muslims consider visual portrayals of the prophets to be sacrilege.

The newly-opened museum announced the news without specifying whether it had bought the painting at auction this month. Media reports say it was purchased by a saudi prince. The work - known as salvator mundi ( saviour of the world ) - was sold in new york for a record $ 450m ( £ 341m ). It was the highest auction price for any work of art.

The work - known as salvator mundi ( saviour of the world ) - was sold in new york for a record $ 450m ( £ 341m ). It was the highest auction price for any work of art. The unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes. The new york times reported that it was bought by saudi prince bader bin abdullah bin mohammed bin farhan al-saud, citing documents the newspaper had reviewed. Leonardo da vinci died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence. Salvator mundi, believed to have been painted sometime after 1505, is the only work thought to be in private hands.

            "People gather around leonardo da vinci's \"salvator mundi \" at christie's auction rooms in london on oct. 24. ( kirsty wigglesworth/ap ) when leonardo da vinci's long-lost painting, \"salvator mundi \" ( \"savior of the world \" ) shattered records by selling for $ 450.3 million at auction in mid-november, its fate remained as mysterious as its unknown buyer. But both were revealed on wednesday. Museumgoers will be able to view the painting at the louvre abu dhabi, a united arab emirates franchise of the paris museum, christie's auction house told bloomberg. The museum appeared to confirm this, tweeting on wednesday that, \"da vinci's salvator mundi is coming to #louvreabudhabi. \" it is unclear at this time when the painting will be displayed. According to the new york times, the painting's buyer was not the museum but an outside party: one prince bader bin abdullah bin mohammed bin farhan al-saud, a \"little-known \" saudi arabian prince with no history as an art collector. The louvre abu dhabi, which opened on nov. 11, has been one of the \"most aggressive buyers on the global art market over the last decade, \" according to bloomberg. These acquisitions, including that of \"salvator mundi, \" are probably part of a dedicated effort to raise the global cultural profile of the uae"

The report published tuesday by the natural resources defense council shows there were 80,000 reported violations of safety regulations like the safe drinking water act in community water systems serving 77 million people in 2015. About 15 % of those violations — affecting 27 million people, or one in 12 americans — were health-based, for instance contamination from lead, copper, arsenic, or other cancer-causing pollutants. Other violations included failure to report contamination to the public and to properly test water, but almost 90 % of the transgressions \" were subject to no formal action, \" the report from the environmental advocacy group states. The problems were most pronounced in very small or rural areas, with nearly 70 % of all violations tied to water systems that serve fewer than 500 people. \" it verifies concerns...

The employee then told sanchez she wasn't allowed to speak spanish at work. The business ' owner, ron schneider, tells the milwaukee journal sentinel he's had the policy for a year. However, he tells fox 6 now, the policy has been in place for a decade. He's also unclear on how strict the policy is. Regardless, he doesn't see the big deal. \" this is still the united states, \" schneider tells the journal sentinel. \" why do we have to get involved in multi-language things. I guess i ' m just an old guy too steeped in tradition. \" one reason for getting involved in multi-language things is that it's typically against federal law to require workers to speak only english. That's why the league of united latin american citizens is asking the us equal employment opportunity commission to look into leon's frozen custard. Another reason is to make customers in a latino-heavy neighborhood more comfortable. \" if they have the people who can speak spanish and communicate with the customer better, why not? \" sanchez tells fox. Schneider says the policy is meant to keep customers from relying on him always having spanish-speaking employees. \" we can't be the united nations, \" he tells wisn. \" they got translators. We don't. \" and he says anyone who thinks the policy makes him a racist is welcome to \" settle it the old-fashioned american way in the alley. \"",

Slate's matt yglesias ignored that rule in selecting jacksonville, fla., which he describes as a not-so-coastal city that just so happens to be on the coast, and a not-so-southern city that just so happens to be in the south. Why he picked it, other than the fact that it's \" not especially distinctive or noteworthy \": unlike cowen's \" distressingly unsystematic \" choice, he ranked us metropolitan areas by population size and jacksonville was smack dab in the middle.

Trump kicked off a rally thursday in delaware, ohio, by saying that he had a major announcement to make. \"i would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the united states that i will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election if i win, \" trump said, prompting a roaring cheer from the crowd.

Some say his remarks only worsened things between him and trump, and whispers continue to point in a southerly direction. Sources tell nbc news that before his trip to pay his respects to the las vegas shooting victims, trump \" fumed \" and vented to chief of staff john kelly for two hours after seeing the nbc report early wednesday about tillerson's alleged comments. Those sources also reveal kelly postponed travel plans that day to \" try to contain his boss's fury, \" meeting quietly with tillerson and defense chief james mattis to try to figure out a blueprint for going forward. When tillerson didn't deny at the presser he'd called the president a moron, trump was said to be further angered. Sources also tell cnn trump had known about the insult before the nbc report, but was infuriated it had leaked. Axios reports what may come next: a new secretary of state in the form of cia director mike pompeo. Trump advisors are said to be mulling this idea, though sources say trump knows another top-level person leaving his administration at this point will get bad press. Axios adds pompeo could likely \" make the switch without chaos \" — he's a person trump trusts — and that sources do think the tillerson-trump relationship is too \" toxic \" to fix. Esquire notes trump's cryptic \" calm before the storm \" comment made thursday during a gathering of military bigwigs may have been a reference to tillerson's farewell, though it also could have meant almost anything else as well.",

In the continental us, experts predict that in a decade, there will be just three areas where the sky will be dark enough to see the milky way clearly, the arizona republic reports. One area covers part of eastern oregon and western idaho, another includes parts of nevada and western utah, a third takes in parts of northern arizona and southern utah — and the latter two are in danger from the bright lights of las vegas and phoenix, which can be seen for more than 200 miles. Light pollution not only hinders astronomy, it can disrupt ecosystems and people's sleeping patterns, warns the international dark-sky association. The tucson-based organization has been trying for years to preserve the west's dark spots, encouraging cities to adopt dark-sky-friendly lighting codes. This month, the group launched a campaign to preserve and promote the dark skies over the colorado plateau, stressing its value as a \" celestial treasure and a celestial refuge \" that has attracted visitors for centuries. \" people need the sense of beauty and perspective and awe that we get from our exposure to the universe in a dark night sky, \" grand canyon ranger marker marshall tells the republic. \" it's part of every culture, part of being human — to contemplate what's above us. \" ( click to read about how the full moon messes with your sleep. )",

Susan collins and lisa murkowski, the other two \" no \" votes, eventually did, and the three seemed animated and peppy ( mccain even seemed to mouth \" i promise \" to murkowski ). But the most dramatic moment came when the vote got underway, with everyone waiting for the roll call clerk to get to the m's. For viewers at home, it didn't seem like mccain answered when his name was called — but that's because mccain had left the room, and when he came back in, right around the time gary peters was casting his vote, mccain strolled to the front of the chamber, held his right arm up, got the clerk's attention, and then turned his thumb to the floor, saying: \" no. \" ( see the shocked gasps and scattered applause in the chamber from that exact moment. ) perhaps this drama shouldn't have come as a surprise: per the washington post and mashable, when mccain arrived at the senate floor shortly after midnight, he cryptically told reporters: \" wait for the show. \"",

        "summary": "It's got a good beat and you can dance to it, but how is its \" processing fluency? \" the term, the washington post explains, is at the heart of social scientists ' latest quest to explain why some songs catch on as the \" song of the summer \" — or the song of any season, really — while others fade away. The concept, laid out by usc researchers in the journal of consumer psychology in april, isn't complicated. In fact, just the opposite: \" processing fluency \" is explained by the post thusly: \" human brains get really jazzed about things that are easy to grasp. \" and in the case of hit songs, that translates into repeating simple words over and over and over. \"tempo does not appear to matter, \" say the researchers, who pored over billboard hits going back to 1958. \" while every artist strives to create a catchy hook, they may also consider striving to write a coherent song in which the chorus is repeated frequently while utilizing a limited vocabulary. \" witness current summer hit \" shut up and dance \" — the post counts 12 repetitions of the title. Researcher joseph nunes elaborates on the simple but powerful market force: \" if it's easier, it feels better. If it feels better, it tells me i like it more. If i have a positive feeling about something because it's familiar, then i think i like it more. \" they did not, however, come up with a magic number of repetitions. More is basically more, says nunes. ( spotify, meanwhile, ranks the most popular songs for couples in a certain mood. )",

The hot, damaged pavement... ( associated press ) cheyenne, wyo. ( ap ) — the ever-changing thermal geology of yellowstone national park has created a hot spot that melted an asphalt road and closed access to popular geysers and other attractions at the height of tourist season, officials said thursday. As they examined possible fixes, park officials warned visitors not to hike into the affected area, where the danger of stepping through solid-looking soil into boiling-hot water was high. \" there are plenty of other great places to see thermal features in the park, \" yellowstone spokesman al nash said. \" i wouldn't risk personal injury to see these during this temporary closure. \" naturally changing thermal features often damage yellowstone's roads and boardwalks. Steaming potholes in asphalt roads and parking lots — marked off by traffic cones — are fairly common curiosities. However, the damage to firehole lake drive is unusually severe and could take several days to fix. The 3.3-mile loop six miles north of old faithful takes visitors past great fountain geyser, white dome geyser and firehole lake. Unusually warm weather"

        "summary": "Plenty of bosses and employees alike would love for the annual job review to go away, and that prospect seems more likely thanks to a move by one of the world's biggest companies. The ceo of consulting firm accenture tells the washington post that its 330,000 workers worldwide will no longer endure the annual ritual starting in september. Instead, managers will give workers more \" fluid \" feedback on the job, and in less formal ways than a once-a-year sitdown. \"we're going to get rid of probably 90 % of what we did in the past, \" says pierre nanterme. In doing so, accenture joins other big-name companies such as microsoft, adobe, expedia, and the accounting giant deloitte that have previously ditched the annual review. Accenture's move, however, could have a bigger influence in the corporate world because the consulting community in general has long been a believer in \" human metrics, \" notes a post at the sydney morning herald. More and more studies are suggesting that the yearly rankings are inefficient and not all that accurate. \"employees that do best in performance management systems tend to be the employees that are the most narcissistic and self-promoting, \" says an hr official with management research firm ceb. \"those aren't necessarily the employees you need to be the best organization going forward. \" for now, the reviews remain a staple in the business world, but \" as more and larger companies show that they can rubbish the review without the sky falling down, more may follow, \" observes a post at quartz.",

            "The 1980s have a lot to answer for. Dynasty and shoulder pads are passe, but performance reviews have managed to stick around. For how much longer? the decade of the 1980s is responsible for all sorts of atrocities, from padded shoulders to boy bands in music. In a corporate sense, the ' 80s ushered in the most universally loathed and feared fashion of all – the performance review. Thirty years on and billions of scared and disgruntled employees later there is at last the beginnings of a real push to rid the world of this scourge, with some large organisations declaring it doesn't drive better performance. Advertisement so captivated was the business world and senior management by what they saw as an opportunity to in some way measure and value the performance of staff – using all sorts of inappropriate criteria – that a vast industry was established around devising systems and tailoring formats for the yearly get-together with the boss that ultimately results in each staff member receiving a ranking against their colleagues. In many respects, the performance review ushered in the rise of the human resources function. The process is as expensive as it is bureaucratic. The washington post quotes a report from management firm ceb that a company that employs 10,000 people spends $ us35 million ( $ 47 million ) a year on performance reviews change is in the air",

        "summary": "Humans aren't alone in a battle with illicit drugs, which have penetrated waterways worldwide via wastewater and other means. European eels are feeling the effects, and probably other animals, too, say researchers at italy's university of naples federico ii. After previously finding cocaine in eel flesh, the team investigated how the drug affects the swimmers, known to travel 3,700 miles across the atlantic ocean to spawn in the sargasso sea, near the bahamas. It certainly wasn't beneficial: farm-raised eels confined for 50 days in a lab tank with roughly the same low-level amount of cocaine found in some rivers, about 20 nanograms per liter, appeared hyperactive and swam faster than their sober counterparts, reports new scientist. Dissection revealed more: skeletal muscle damage that remained even after the eels spent 10 days in clean water. Researchers predict migration difficulties as a result. \" in addition to sufficient energy reserves, the eel needs a healthy skeletal muscle and an efficient aerobic metabolism, in order to complete successfully its migration, \" they write in science of the total environment. Study author anna capaldo offers more at national geographic, explaining cocaine's effect on cortisol and dopamine levels could impair reproduction and prevent an eel from reaching sexual maturity. It's more bad news for the eels already critically endangered by habitat loss, pollution, and over-fishing, per smithsonian. But humans should be concerned, too: \" since the skeletal muscle is the edible part of the eel, \" those with a taste for european river eels could be ingesting cocaine, though probably not enough to be dangerous, researchers say.

        "summary": "\" for this individual to take it upon himself to create this chaos and harm is unspeakable, \" clark county sheriff joe lombardo said tuesday as he released new details on the deadliest mass shooting in modern american history. The sheriff says gunman stephen paddock had \" preplanned, extensively \" for the las vegas massacre, hiding a camera in the peephole of his hotel suite and two more in the hallway, one of them on a service cart, to watch for police, the washington post reports. Lombardo said paddock shot through the room door, injuring a security guard, before putting a gun in his mouth and killing himself as a swat team closed in. The latest developments: authorities say paddock had attached \" bump stock \" devices to 12 of the 23 guns he had in the mandalay bay hotel room, allowing the semiautomatic rifles to fire as fast as fully automatic weapons, usa today reports. Atf special agent in charge jill schneider says authorities determined the weapons were legal. In body camera footage released by police on tuesday, officers can be heard shouting at bystanders to get away and trying to determine the source of the gunfire, the new york times reports. \" hey, they're shooting right at us, guys, \" one officer says. \"everybody stay down, stay down. \" another says: \" north of the mandalay bay, it's coming out of a window. \" a law enforcement source tells the daily beast that paddock may have originally planned to attack a different musical event. The source says the weekend before he opened fire on the route 91 harvest festival, the gunman rented multiple condos in the ogden tower, which overlooked the life is beautiful music festival. Lorde and chance the rapper headlined the event this year. Sen. Dianne feinstein, the democrat who authored the 1994 ban on assault weapons, has renewed her call to ban bump stocks, the guardian reports. \" this is the least we should do in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in us history, \" she says. \" it should be our highest priority. \" the las vegas review-journal reports that paddock, whose motive is still unknown, was prescribed the anti-anxiety medication diazepam in june. Studies have shown that the drug, brand name valium, can trigger aggressive behavior. The international association of fire fighters union says that out of the many off-duty firefighters who were at the festival, at least a dozen were shot, two of them while they performed cpr on victims, the las vegas sun reports. Some firefighters brought injured loved ones to safety before immediately returning to the scene to help the wounded. Marilou",

            "Juan camilo bernal / shutterstock.com mark twain is said to have remarked that a gold rush is a good time to be in the pick and shovel business. Investors may be able to apply that same bit of wisdom to the growing number of u.s. States that have legalized pot. Although federal law prohibits the sale or possession of marijuana, massachusetts last week joined the ranks of states — 18 plus washington, d.c. — that allow its use for people suffering from chronic illnesses like cancer, hiv/aids, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. In washington and colorado, meanwhile, voters passed an initiative to allow pot for recreational use. Those changes have kickstarted a small but fast-growing medical-marijuana industry, estimated to be worth about $ 1.7 billion as of 2011, according to see change strategy, an independent financial-analysis firm that specializes in new markets. In colorado alone, sales topped $ 181 million in 2010, and the business employed 4,200 state-licensed workers, says aaron smith, executive director of the national cannabis industry association, a nonprofit trade group that campaigns for marijuana's federal legalization. In addition to profiting itself from growing and selling marijuana, the industry benefits a slew of other businesses, such as insurers, lawyers and agricultural-equipment firms, experts say. \"call it the 'green rush, ' \" says derek peterson, ceo of growop technology,"

The turkish lira continues to plunge, at one point hitting a record low against the dollar on monday, reports the bbc. At the start of the year, one us dollar would buy four lira, and today it would buy about seven, notes cnn. The nation's central bank took some steps to ease the crisis, but it did not raise interest rates as investors hoped, and markets tumbled in asia and europe. Us stock futures also were down monday morning, notes marketwatch. At play is a \" cocktail of economic vulnerabilities, \" volatile national politics, and a worsening spat with the us over a detained american pastor, reports the wall street journal. \" we will not give in, \" turkish president recep tayyip erdogan said in a speech sunday, resisting calls to raise rates and blasting the us, which has been ratcheting up sanctions because of the pastor. \" if you come at us with your dollars then we will find other ways to do business. \" he also implored traders not to rush to buy dollars. \" otherwise i will have to implement plan b or c, \" he said, with the journal noting that he did not actually say what either of those plans might be. The financial trouble is hitting other emerging markets that rely on foreign investors particularly hard, including those in south africa and india. The turkish government, meanwhile, also said it was going after the owners of 346 social media accounts for expressing \" provocative \" views about the lira and worsening the crisis.

A new exhibit at kennedy space center features two pieces of debris, one from each lost shuttle, as well as poignant, personal reminders of the 14 astronauts killed in flight. It is an unprecedented collection of artifacts — the first time, in fact, that any challenger or columbia remains have been openly displayed. Nasa's intent is to show how the astronauts lived, rather than how they died. As such, there are no pictures in the \" forever remembered \" exhibit of challenger breaking apart in the florida sky nearly 30 years ago or columbia debris raining down on texas 12 years ago. Since the tragic re-entry, columbia's scorched remains have been stashed in off-limits offices at the space center. But nasa had to pry open the underground tomb housing challenger's pieces — a pair of abandoned missile silos at neighboring cape canaveral air force station — to retrieve the section of fuselage now on display. The exhumation was conducted in secrecy. Everything about the exhibit, in fact, was kept hush-hush during the four years it took to complete the project, out of respect to the dead astronauts ' families. June scobee rodgers had never seen",

            "Cape canaveral, fla. ( ap ) — nasa is offering up wreckage from the challenger and columbia for public view after hiding it from the world for decades. A new exhibit at kennedy space center features two pieces of debris, one from each lost shuttle, as well as poignant, personal reminders of the 14 astronauts killed in flight. It is an unprecedented collection of artifacts — the first time, in fact, that any challenger or columbia remains have been openly displayed. Nasa's intent is to show how the astronauts lived, rather than how they died. As such, there are no pictures in the \" forever remembered \" exhibit of challenger breaking apart in the florida sky nearly 30 years ago or columbia debris raining down on texas 12 years ago. Since the tragic re-entry, columbia's scorched remains have been stashed in off-limits offices at the space center. But nasa had to pry open the underground tomb housing challenger's pieces — a pair of abandoned missile silos at neighboring cape canaveral air force station — to retrieve the section of fuselage now on display. The exhumation was conducted in secrecy. Everything about the exhibit, in fact, was kept hush-hush during the four years it took to complete the project, out of respect to the dead astronauts ' families. June scobee rodgers had never seen",

As part of that case comes the specific rape allegation, which was part of a motion filed monday by dowd's lawyers. Per the filing, the woman alleges the then-married rose himself called her in 1973, when she was 14 or 15, and they started to meet at a cincinnati home. \" it was at that house where, before my sixteenth birthday, pete rose began a sexual relationship with me. \" her sworn testimony goes on to say they continued the relationship for years, and that the sex occurred outside ohio as well. The enquirer notes the filing contains a written statement in which rose himself confirms the affair, but he dates it to 1975, and says he thought the girl was well over 16 — the age of consent in ohio. Espn notes that the statute of limitations has long passed, so no criminal charges would come out of this.

Winterset, iowa, was the hometown of john wayne, although his name was marion morrison then. Nile kinnick, who won the heisman trophy at the university of iowa, was feller's catcher in american legion ball and grew up in adel, iowa. A sportscaster called \" dutch \" reagan was working in desmoines. Feller's life was a tale as tall as any of theirs. Ted williams, the consensus choice as baseball's all-time greatest hitter, closely studied pitchers, but he never obsessed about them -- except for one. Feller captivated williams. While williams would focus on someone like allie reynolds of the yankees, a terrific pitcher, for two hours before a game, he started psyching up three days before facing feller. The difference between feller's stuff and \" good \" stuff was always exponential. Feller had a \" field of dreams, \" in iowa, just like in the movie. After clearing the land with his own hands, his father planted more wheat than corn on the rest of the farm. Wheat was easier to harvest, which left more time for baseball. That's a synthesis of",

Three decades later, the late german archaeologist klaus schmidt opted to investigate anyway. What he found beneath the earth was astounding: towering t-shape and spiked limestone pillars with animals carved into them, fashioned in a set of rings. As national geographic reported in 2011, \" the site is vaguely reminiscent of stonehenge, \" with a massive exception: it was created some 7,000 years before both that monument and before the pyramids. Indeed, a press release announcing a new $ 15 million, 20-year investment into göbekli tepe calls the 12,000-year-old site the \" oldest monument known to mankind \" — and one discovery news notes \" has so far received limited attention globally. \" conventional wisdom has it that hunter-gatherers settling down to grow crops spurred civilization. Schmidt argued, however, that the reverse happened, with agriculture emerging as the solution to the problem of how to feed the sizable labor force needed to move \" 16-ton stones hundreds of feet despite having no wheels or beasts of burden, \" as national geographic puts it. The funding, revealed wednesday at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland ( accompanied by an ice sculpture recreation ), will go toward research and protection: new excavations, fencing, protective canopies, and the construction of a \" world-class \" visitor center to draw visitors to an area that has seen tourism battered by its proximity to syria and the refugee crisis, reports national geographic.

One female, karen harmeyer, was killed; the 64-year-old was homeless, and her decomposing remains were found in her tent in july, reports the ap. The first killing — that of john palmer, 54 — happened in august 2016, with his body found some distance from indian creek trail. The sixth is what police say broke the case. Steven gibbons, 57, was shot after riding a kansas city bus on aug. 13, and investigators say scott was captured on video trailing gibbons, and that his dna was found on an iced tea bottle and a cigarette butt at the scene. In addition to all the victims being middle aged, all were white. While court records also show scott, who is black, once threatened to \" kill all white people, \" the kansas city star says police have not identified a racial motivation in the shootings, and his mother in an august interview said she doubted race was a factor.

        "summary": "A rogue beaver struck terror into the heart of a man making his way home late at night in the latvian city of daugavpils, according to a local newspaper report picked up by latvian public broadcasting. The man, identified only as sergei, says the beaver ran out of some bushes and suddenly bit him. He fell over as he tried to fight the rodent off and was bitten again as he tried to get up. In what usa today describes as a \" kafkian nightmare, \" sergei phoned police as the beaver \" held him hostage \" and refused to let him get up, only to have his plea for help allegedly dismissed as a prank call. Sergei managed to persuade an initially disbelieving friend to come to his rescue, but the friend was pulled over by police for speeding. Cops — after breathalyzing the friend — accompanied him to the scene and discovered he had been telling the truth about the hostile beaver. Animal welfare officers were called and the man's ordeal ended with him receiving 15 stitches, though the beaver is still at large. Latvia's tv.net reports that authorities in daugavpils are taking the incident seriously, though it is \" quite difficult to choose the measures which should be taken \" to prevent similar attacks by beavers, which can become increasingly aggressive when they seek out new homes in spring. ( this man was killed by a beaver after he tried to take its photo. )",

The compromise, as explained by the washington post: victims can use the money for legal services but not for medical care, including abortions. If they need medical help, they ' ll be eligible to tap into a different fund already in place and already subject to abortion restrictions under the hyde amendment.

        "summary": "Abdallah khader was just 2 years old in 2009 when his family's car was hit by a drunk driver. Yesterday morning, at age 8, he succumbed to the injuries he sustained in that crash. Abdallah's parents tell wfaa he died at a fort worth, texas, medical center; he had been in a near-vegetative state since the crash, strapped to a chair and on oxygen, and he frequently suffered from pneumonia, including at the time of his death. Meanwhile, stewart richardson — whose blood alcohol level was about three times the legal limit on the night of the crash in arlington, texas — remains in jail awaiting trial. His case is tied up because, wfaa reported last year, prosecutors want to use his prior dwi-related charges to get him a longer sentence — possibly life in prison rather than a maximum of 20 years. Richardson, 50, has seven prior convictions for driving under the influence, some of them in other states, the dallas morning news reports. In this case, he's been charged with repeat dwi offense as well as intoxication assault, but after the medical examiner rules on abdallah's cause of death, the district attorney could change those charges. But prosecutors say abdallah's death will not change the punishment they're seeking for richardson, wfaa reports. Parents loubna and fahad khader say the experience has been torture; in february, loubna confronted richardson, who apologized to her. \" i ' m supposed to go home now and my son is going to be ok because you said you're sorry? \" she said. \" it's been five years today. Five years! my son is dying every single day. \" ( in november, a drunk driver involved in a fatal crash got into another crash 11 years later. )",

Then there are shows like family guy, in which \" abortion-coat-hanger jokes \" are common, female characters suffer constant verbal abuse, and there's \" more rape humor than one could tally. \" it's not fair to blame a tv show for real-life actions, \" but if you can laugh at rape on tv, why wouldn't the real thing be funny if you're young and drunk and if the developmental maturity to control your impulses is years away? \" parker's full column here; schrobsdorff's here.",

Prosecutors said vanessa maccormack, a second-grade teacher in revere, mass., had recently threatened to divorce maccormack and sell their house, the boston globe reports. They said maccormack had a $ 500-a-week habit and his wife became suspicious after thousands of dollars disappeared from their account and he blamed it on hackers. Her $ 13,000 engagement ring also went missing, as did a replacement ring. Maccormack, 29, is accused of beating and suffocating vanessa to death at their home on saturday. Prosecutors said that after maccormack killed vanessa, he took their 1-year-old daughter with him to a carpentry job. They said he left when she needed a fresh diaper, but instead of picking up a new one, he withdrew cash from an atm and bought cocaine before returning home to clean up the crime scene before calling 911, cbs news reports. Police said they found him \" hyperventilating \" outside the home. Maccormack's attorney argued that an intruder must have committed the crime because bleach was used to clean the crime scene, something he said maccormack would not have done because his dna was already in the home.

Amid online conspiracy theories that the operation is an excuse for president obama to impose martial law on texas and put political prisoners in fema camps disguised as closed walmarts, the texas governor announced last week he had ordered the state guard to monitor the military exercises to safeguard the \" safety, constitutional rights, private property rights, and civil liberties \" of texans, npr reports. This was too much for some of abbott's fellow republicans, including former state rep. Todd smith, who accused the governor of \" pandering to idiots. \" \" i am horrified that i have to choose between the possibility that my governor actually believes this stuff and the possibility that my governor doesn't have the backbone to stand up to those who do, \" smith wrote in an open letter to the governor. Texas sen. Ted cruz, meanwhile, says he does not believe the military operation is cover for a coup, but his office will ask the pentagon about it anyway because \" the federal government has not demonstrated itself to be trustworthy in this administration, \" raw story reports. It's not clear why the july 15 to september 15 exercise has generated such paranoia, though the \" perhaps impolitic \" slogan \" mastering the human domain \" may have worked against it, writes bob campbell at the odessa american.",

        "summary": "It's a good year for the military's spy blimp program: after years of delays, a huge blimp-like airship will take to the skies over maryland sometime in the next week as part of a $ 2.8 billion project that the military says is designed to spot cruise missiles or other threats heading toward washington, dc, and other east coast cities. When deployed in full next year, the jlens — joint land attack cruise missile defense elevated netted sensor system — will feature two tethered airships floating at 10,000 feet and constantly scanning a vast area to detect missiles for other military systems to destroy, the ap reports. The project was built by raytheon, which says it will work out a lot cheaper than using aircraft to cover the same area. But privacy advocates fear that the aerostats, which are capable of tracking everything for many miles around if equipped with the right cameras, could become part of what dan froomkin at the intercept calls the \" us surveillance leviathan. \" the military has said they won't be used to spy on us citizens, but with government agencies, \" things tend to expand and privacy protections tend to shrink, \" an aclu spokesman warns. The blimps, which will be tethered north of baltimore and easily seen from interstate 95, are around 80 yards long with a total volume around 600,000 cubic feet. \" that's about the size of three goodyear blimps, \" froomkin notes. \" or over 3,500 white elephants. \" ( in canada earlier this year, pilots were warned about a runaway beer blimp. )",

Hogan says his shutdown, which will take \" a couple of weeks \" and save taxpayers up to $ 15 million a year, will transfer the jail's workers and inmates to other facilities, though details are scarce for security reasons. The aclu was recently in court to complain about the center, which it called \" a dank and dangerous place, where detainees are confined in dirty cells infested with vermin \" and with showers \" full of drain flies, black mold, and filth, \" reports the new york times, which notes the prison will be demolished. In 2013, dozens of inmates and corrections officers were convicted for enabling the black guerrilla family gang's drug-trafficking and money-laundering scheme, per the washington post. \" inmates were literally running this prison, \" hogan says per the times, which notes indictment descriptions of the center \" read like cable television scripts about a dystopian prison. \" but issues remain on the transition. The aclu's national prison project director tells the sun that \" shockingly deficient \" conditions still exist in other city jails, while a lawyer who worked on the federal lawsuit worries such a fast move could result in confusion regarding prisoners ' medical conditions and meds.",

        "summary": "If you're a verizon business customer, beware: the contact information for 1.5 million verizon enterprise customers has been stolen, according to cybersecurity blogger brian krebs. Sources tell krebsonsecurity that \" a prominent member of a closely guarded underground cybercrime forum \" offered all 1.5 million records for sale this week for $ 100,000, or chunks of 100,000 records for $ 10,000 a pop. Verizon acknowledged to krebsonsecurity that a security vulnerability in its site allowed hackers to grab customer information, and says it's working to alert those who were affected. Ironically, verizon enterprise solutions helps companies respond to data breaches. \" even if it is limited to the contact data for technical managers at companies that use verizon enterprise solutions \" — 99 % of fortune 500 companies reportedly do so — \" it's a fair bet that if cyber thieves buy all or some of the verizon enterprise customer database, some of those customers may be easy marks for phishing and other targeted attacks, \" krebs warns. The underground seller is also offering to sell information about verizon's security flaws. As chris mills points out on gizmodo, \" there's no cause for concern if you're a verizon wireless consumer, \" but this is \" embarrassing \" considering it happened to a wing of verizon that offers cybersecurity services.",
