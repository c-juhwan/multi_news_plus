The oil is extracted naturally from the first press of the olives, as opposed to using heat or chemicals. It's basically olive juice, reports mother nature news, and it must have zero defects. But in this more delicate state, it is also highly perishable, with a shelf life of around two years that is dramatically shortened if exposed to light and heat ( hence olive oil tins or darker glass ). A few years ago, a researcher found a \" shockingly \" high 69 % of imported extra virgin olive oil samples ( and 10 % of california's ) flunked standards including, say, rancidity or having more than zero fruitiness, reports time. Now that same researcher has more grim news: among 15 extra virgin olive oils tested from restaurant suppliers, one contained cheap canola oil and 60 % failed to meet standards to be accurately labeled extra virgin. What's more, as up in arms as many sensory scientists have gotten about the pressing matter, most americans tested cannot tell if an olive oil has gone rancid and don't know what extra virgin or cold pressed even mean, reports fivethirtyeight. In blind taste tests, americans tend to prefer the lower-quality olive oils — perhaps because we have become so accustomed to them, perhaps because fresh olive oils are actually more bitter. \" we call the us the world's dumping ground for rancid and defective olive oil, \" one sensory scientist says. \" we don't know the difference. \" so why care? as high quality oil spoils, its health benefits diminish, too.

In the latest program for international student assessment ( pisa ) comparative survey of the academic performance of 15-year-olds around the world  an authoritative study released every three years  chinese teenagers from shanghai far outscored their international peers in all three subject matters that were tested last year: reading, math and science. ( see pictures of shanghai's world expo 2010. ) in reading, the main focus of the pisa survey, more than 19 % of the shanghai students attained the top two grades, almost double the proportion in the u.s. And nearly three times the average of major developed countries. At the bottom end, just over 4 % of the shanghai students failed to make the grade that is considered the baseline for reading literacy. Elsewhere, on average, four times as many students struggled below that level. This is the first time that china has participated in the pisa tests, and the results are especially stunning because they are so unexpected;"

Consider this: between june 2010 and june 2011, world grain prices almost doubled. In many places on this planet, that proved an unmitigated catastrophe. In those same months, several governments fell, rioting broke out in cities from bishkek, kyrgyzstan, to nairobi, kenya, and most disturbingly three new wars began in libya, yemen, and syria. Even on egypt's sinai peninsula, bedouin tribes are now in revolt against the country's interim government and manning their own armed roadblocks.

He was 69. He was often picked to play the villain, but he was \" one of britain's best-loved acting stars, \" per the bbc. Known across generations, rickman got his start performing with the royal shakespeare company before nabbing roles in die hard ( a part he was offered just two days after arriving in los angeles at age 41 ); robin hood: prince of thieves; love actually; and the harry potter films, per the guardian. He also showed his softer side in the romance truly, madly, deeply and in the film adaptation of jane austen's sense and sensibility. His last works, eye in the sky and alice through the looking glass, are due out later this year. \" rickman was a one-off... An actor of singular charm and hypnotic charisma, \" film critic peter bradshaw writes at the guardian. \" he was a glorious cavalier in a world of roundheads. \" on twitter, british actor stephen fry calls rickman \" a man of such talent, wicked charm &amp; stunning screen &amp; stage presence, \" while harry potter actor james phelps describes him as \" one of the nicest actors i've ever met. \" \" a film, a piece of theater, a piece of music, or a book can make a difference. It can change the world, \" rickman once said. He leaves behind his wife, rima horton, whom he married secretly in recent years after nearly 50 years together, per the telegraph.",

Unit 450, an all-alawite squad so secretive that even high-ranking military defectors aren't aware of its existence, has been divvying up and dispersing its stockpiles for months, us and middle eastern officials tell the wall street journal. Officials believe the regime's 1,000 metric tons of chemical agents, once concentrated in a few large stores, are now scattered to as many as 50 locations across syria. \" we know a lot less than we did six months ago about where the chemical weapons are, \" one us official says. And even if the us did know all the locations, attacking unit 450 \" would be a pretty tricky affair because … if you attack them you may reduce the security of their weapons, \" a former defense intelligence agency member says. For the same reason, the us won't share the location of stockpiles with the rebels. In other syria news: john kerry says his first day of talks with russian counterpart sergei lavrov was \" constructive, \" the new york times reports. The sides remain divided on whether the un resolution should have a military component. Kerry argued for that military component forcefully in lengthy remarks yesterday. Lavrov seemed taken aback. \" i ' m not prepared with the extended political statement, \" he said. \" diplomacy likes silence. \" one thing has already come out of the talks: the sides agreed to hold peace talks later this month in new york in the hopes of ending the war diplomatically, cnn reports. Bashar al-assad, meanwhile, is feeling emboldened enough to make demands. Yesterday he said he'd only relinquish his chemical weapons if the us \" ceases arms deliveries to terrorists, \" meaning the rebels. Assad also suggested that the russian plan could be used to drag things out. \" it doesn't mean that syria will sign the documents, fulfill the obligations, and that's it, \" he said.",

        "summary": "President trump may be keeping his tax returns close to the vest, but bloomberg thinks it has a handle on his net worth. Its latest billionaires index pegs it at $ 2.9 billion, down from $ 3 billion last year. The site chalks up the loss mainly to three under-performing office towers in new york city — 40 wall street, trump tower, and 1290 avenue of the americas. Other aspects of trump's business empire did better, but not enough to offset the loss in value of that trio. The $ 2.9 billion figure is not quite enough for trump to crack the index's top 500 richest people in the world: it runs from bill gates at $ 89.5 billion to evan spiegel at $ 3.83 billion. Bloomberg compiled the estimate from its own market estimates and from various public documents, including trump's latest financial disclosure report, which came out last week. The hill notes the report puts trump's net worth at a minimum of $ 1.1 billion and shows that trump has one clear winner among his holdings: his mar-a-lago country club in florida. Revenues at the resort were up $ 8 million, thanks in part to a doubling of membership fees. In all, trump reported $ 598 million in income in 2016.",

Susan garsh on tuesday agreed to erase aaron hernandez's conviction in a 2013 murder because he died before his appeal was heard. Garsh said she was compelled to follow massachusetts case law, which has long established that defendants who have not had the merits of their appeals decided before they die have the right to have their convictions vacated, reports the ap. Prosecutor patrick bomberg had argued hernandez \" should not be able to accomplish in death what he could not accomplish in life. \" lawyers for hernandez countered that the state's highest court had applied the legal doctrine \" without exception, \" even in cases — like hernandez's — of suicide. Garsh rejected the argument that hernandez had forfeited his right to appeal by taking his own life on april 19, saying no one can ever know for sure why hernandez killed himself. Prosecutors plan to appeal garsh's decision, reports cnn, which notes they based their original argument on two pieces of evidence: an inmate's testimony that hernandez had heard a \" rumor \" about the legal principle, and the suicide note left for his fiancee. \" you're rich, \" he wrote to shayanna jenkins-hernandez. Cnn explains the mother of odin lloyd, the man hernandez was originally convicted of murdering, hit hernandez's estate with a wrongful death lawsuit. The absence of a criminal conviction could adversely affect her civil case.",

A judge ordered police to erase the records amid allegations that the reality tv star on 19 kids and counting had molested five underage girls as a teenager, the ap reports via usa today. \" the judge ordered us yesterday to expunge that record, \" a police rep said on friday. \" as far as the springdale police department is concerned this report doesn't exist. \" but a redacted copy posted by in touch says duggar confessed to authorities and received no punishment — just a \" very stern talk \" from a state trooper, people reports. That was 16 months after duggar first admitted \" wrong-doing \" to his father, jim bob, the reports say. Duggar also sought rehabilitation at the institute in basic life principles training center in little rock, arkansas, before going to police, adds people. The center purports to \" strengthen individuals and families through sound biblical teachings, \" its website says, but has been called a place \" where these kids almost disappear \" and was investigated by child protective services. The center's founder, 79-year-old bill gothard, resigned after accusations last year of sexual harassment and assault against 34 women. Duggar's alleged crimes were no secret either, torpedoing a duggar family appearance on oprah in 2006 and coming up on a message board a year later, gawker reports. \" oprah was informed that josh...

Each time hassen went down with his \" injury, \" his teammates rushed to the sideline to feast on dates and water during the medical delay. It seems to have helped: in one game, tunisia trailed portugal 2-1 before the delay, but tied the game six minutes after the break. The match ended in a draw. The second match also ended in a draw, though apparently without the help of a date-fueled goal. The not-so-subtle scheme is making the rounds of tunisian social media, and hassen himself has joined in. \" i was hurt, bruv, \" he tweeted, per the bbc's translation — but he added three laughing emojis. Both of the matches were \" friendlies, \" or exhibition games.

Mayor karen weaver told the flint city council monday that the city needs federal help in dealing with the crisis. \" the city of flint has experienced a manmade disaster, \" weaver wrote in a statement posted on twitter. Residents complained after the switch in april 2014 about urine-colored water that smelled and tasted awful, as well as health concerns like hair loss. City and state officials first denied the water was unsafe, the washington post reports, but in january, a notice was issued to residents noting that a disinfection byproduct tied to cancer and other illnesses was present in the water. Not only that, but lead leached into untreated ( or insufficiently treated ) corrosive water as it swept through old pipes, the detroit free press notes. Genesee county first declared a public health emergency after a study found that from april 2014 to october 2015, the percentage of babies and children with lead levels in their blood that were higher than average almost doubled throughout the city, while those in particularly high-risk areas saw that percentage almost triple, per michigan live. The city is once again hooked up to the detroit water system, but fears remain high: the who notes the \" neurological and [ behavioral ] effects of lead are believed to be irreversible, \" adding that affected kids can suffer mental retardation, disruptive behavior, and even coma and death. \" the deliberately false denials about the safety of the flint river water was as deadly as it was arrogant, \" reads a class-action lawsuit filed in november by flint residents, per the post.

The akron man went out around 2pm on tuesday afternoon to run a few errands, and if he hadn't made a final stop to pick up a couple of hot pockets at dollar general, he would have been home when a business jet smashed into his apartment building around 40 minutes after he left it, cleveland.com reports. The 38-year-old tells the akron beacon journal that he was driving home when he spotted smoke and flames, saw his building was on fire, and thought: \" oh, my god. What did i do? \" amazingly, bartley made it to his 4pm shift at a plastics factory, where his boss gave him the day off after hearing about the fiery destruction of his home. Bartley, who rented the apartment, lost almost all of his possessions, but he knows it could have been much worse. \" everybody feels lucky. But you never feel this lucky, \" he tells the beacon journal. Authorities are still investigating the crash of the 10-seat hawker h25 jet, which came down around 2 miles from akron fulton international airport.

In the past, such drugs have been successful on worms and mice, but they've failed when it comes to humans, nature reports. Dogs, however, suffer from some of the same age-related diseases we do, and they also live in comparable environments — meaning they could offer a better look at how the drugs might affect us. In this case, researchers want to test a drug called rapamycin, which comes from a chemical found in the soil of easter island, wbur reports. Studies in mice have shown that it extends females ' lives by 13 % and males ' by 9 %. University of washington in seattle researchers are proposing a pilot trial composed of 30 large dogs aged six to nine whose lifespan is typically no more than 10 years; researchers would provide half of them with the drug. It's not entirely clear how rapamycin, which is used in people to prevent rejection after kidney transplants, contributes to a longer life; one theory is that it keeps cancer at bay. On the downside, it's been tied to a heightened risk of diabetes among the kidney-transplant patients who have taken it. ( in other easter island news, scientists now believe the islanders weren't as isolated as long thought. )",

When their medallions approach cruise staff, employee tablets display their names and information about them. The medallions collect info about cruisers ' meals and activities so staff can customize both without cruisers asking first. The medallions will let staff know where cruisers are and even allow entertainers to give shout-outs to cruisers watching from the privacy of their rooms. Jennifer jolly at usa today tried out the ocean medallion and says it's like returning to childhood, when you didn't have to worry about your wallet or keys.

Previously, gay groups had only been allowed to join in combination with other groups, and their identification had to be kept quiet. \" organizers have diligently worked to keep politics — of any kind — out of the parade in order to preserve it as a single and unified cultural event. Paradoxically, that ended up politicizing the parade, \" said parade planners. The group, out@nbcuniversal, consists of workers for the network broadcasting the event; nbc had suggested it could scrap coverage if the policy regarding gay participants wasn't changed, irishcentral notes. The guinness beer company had also pulled its backing from the parade; the brewery's reps have been meeting with parade organizers on the issue, an insider tells the side. \" once an iconic company like guinness showed it was standing up, pretty much everyone else had to follow, \" the source notes. Additional gay groups will be welcomed in the future, a parade rep says. The event is \" remaining loyal to church teachings, \" organizers add, with parade grand marshal cardinal timothy dolan backing the shift.",

That's according to new research that shows people are most likely to be dishonest for personal gain the closer they are to the end of something, scientific american reports. Three researchers gave more than 2,500 people more than 25,000 opportunities to cheat and found the odds of cheating were nearly three times higher \" at the end of a series, \" the researchers write. According to emirates 24/7, participants were most likely to cheat when they knew it was their last chance to do so. \"the data also suggests that people cheat at the end because they want to avoid feeling regret about passing up a final chance for personal gain, \" researcher daniel effron says. In one experiment, subjects who were recruited online were told to flip a coin and attempt to influence it, with their minds, to land on \" heads. \" every time a participant reported the coin landing on one side or the other ( researchers switched it up ), they were given a cash prize, and there was no way for researchers to verify they were telling the truth. In early flips, self-reported \" winning flips \" hovered around the expected 50 %, but they shot up on the final flips. In a second experiment, people were hired to grade essays and were paid based on how long they claimed they spent on each. A secret timer found participants were most likely to lie about how long it took them to grade the final essay. The researchers note that the study can help organizations looking out for unethical behavior know when to deploy their limited resources. ( meanwhile, another recent study shows who's more likely to cheat in a relationship. )",

As the first anniversary of the ferguson protests approaches, a group identifying itself as the hactivist collective anonymous has issued a threat to members of the ku klux klan: in november of last year, anonymous members launched operation kkk, or #opkkk, after a chapter of the kkk reportedly threatened to use \" lethal force \" against people protesting the killing of unarmed teenager michael brown by a police officer in ferguson, missouri. At the time, the hacker collective vowed to wage a \" cyber war \" against the hate group, saying: \" you messed with our family and now we will mess with yours. \" within a couple of days of launching the #opkkk campaign last year, anonymous members claimed to have taken over the kkk's main twitter account and other websites associated with the group. \" we want the kkk gone, forever, \" a person going by the username \"six"

No ids have been released, but earlier harris county sheriff ed gonzalez said most victims were students at santa fe high school. Usa today reports that nine of the dead are students. The suspected gunman, a student at the school, is in custody, and abbott said \" one or two \" other people of interest were being interviewed, but it was unclear what, if any, role they might have played in the attack. Identified: the alleged shooter has been identified as 17-year-old dimitrios pagourtzis, a junior at the school. The ap says he played on the school's jv football team and belongs to the dance squad of a local greek orthodox church. Khou reports that he recently posted an image of a t-shirt reading \" born to kill \" and a caption of \" we all die sometime. \" he also reportedly posted images of knives, guns, and a coat with nazi insignia. Abbott said pagourtzis told police he planned to commit suicide but couldn't go through with it. Explosives: police say possible explosives were found at the school as well as at a site off campus. \" evidently this guy threw pipe bombs, \" one law enforcement official tells the houston chronicle. \" we don't know if any of them went off. \" bomb technicians also were at a home in galveston county, a few miles from the school, reports ktrk. Weapons: pagourtzis used two guns in the attack that he stole from his father, a shotgun and a.38 revolver, said abbott, per the washington post.",

        "summary": "\" a seismic blow. \" \" titanic upset. \" such are the phrases being used to describe rep. Joe crowley's tuesday-night loss in new york. It ushers in the end of a 20-year house career for the man who occupied the no. 4 spot among the democrats within it. Alexandria ocasio-ortez, the 28-year-old woman who bested him, has advocated medicare for all, an end to ice, and affordable housing. The new york times notes the former bernie sanders organizer has said she decided to run after her experience fighting against the dakota pipeline at standing rock. Here's what her win may mean for nancy pelosi and house dems: it had long been assumed that once pelosi bowed out, it would be a crowley vs. Steny hoyer match-up. \" crowley's defeat could put pressure on other members of the caucus to declare their ambitions now, given that spots rarely open up in house democratic leadership without an assumed successor, \" observes heather caygle for politico. She offers this list of potentials: the no. 5 dem, rep. Linda sanchez; rep. Hakeem jeffries ( ny ), rep. Cheri bustos ( ill. ), and rep. Ben ray lujan ( nm ). But who might step up isn't the only question caygle sees. That a 28-year-old former sanders organizer won serves as \" a reminder of the generational demands for change at the top of the party hierarchy \" and \" renews questions \" about the viability of pelosi and hoyer, who are both nearing 80.",

In georgia, any person under 18 can't get a tattoo, even with a parent's permission. In virginia, there is no age requirement to get inked.

He started out by getting a clover on his lower leg. \" it was a memory, it was something i wanted to do. It was something that meant something to me, \" said seiden. Years later, he says he would do it again and even let his kids get one when they turn 14. \" that's when i got mine and i thought at that point in my life i made a wise decision.

The group says that sea lion deaths caused by humans rise along with fishing runs since sea lions and fishermen are competing for the same fish. They predict that the peak fishing season from december to february will bring more deaths. Noaa fisheries is urging fishermen to try different ways to deter the animals, including using horns, bells, underwater firecrackers, or even rubber bullets. West seattle resident randie stone tells the seattle times that two dead sea lions washed up near her home in the space of two days. The first one had been repeatedly shot. \" to me, this is such a heinous act, \" she says. Authorities are investigating the killings, which carry a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $ 28,500 fine under the marine mammal protection act. Over the last 20 years, as the creatures ' numbers rose to more than 250,000, more than 700 california sea lions that were shot or stabbed have washed up on the west coast, though prosecutions of fishermen for the killings have been rare.

The 21-year-old victim, who was treated in the hospital for birdshot injuries to his lower body after being shot twice with a shotgun, was with two companions who managed to get white's license plate number, police say. A few hours after the shooting, which police believe followed some kind of argument over the injured deer, white was arrested and charged with attempted murder, first-degree assault, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, wboc reports. He would have been charged as an adult anyway because of the firearm, police say, though he was still 17 at the time of the incident.

The tiny creature, found in fossils from the \" cambrian explosion \" of diverse life 500 million years ago, has 14 to 16 legs and large spikes on its back, and researchers have long puzzled over which end of it is meant to be in front. But after taking a close look at its claws, scientists have concluded that it isn't an evolutionary one-off as was once thought, but a relative of the tiny \" velvet worms \" with stubby legs that can still be found in tropical forests today, the independent reports. Researchers say that the claws have much in common with the jaws of the velvet worms, which \" are no more than legs modified for chewing, \" the washington post reports. The connection is exciting, researchers say, because it upends the previous understanding of the family tree of insects and other arthropods. \" it's often thought that modern animal groups arose fully formed during the cambrian explosion, \" the lead researcher says in a press release. \" but evolution is a gradual process: today's complex anatomies emerged step by step, one feature at a time.

The animal, known as hallucigenia due to its otherworldly appearance, had been considered an ' evolutionary misfit ' as it was not clear how it related to modern animal groups. Researchers from the university of cambridge have discovered an important link with modern velvet worms, also known as onychophorans, a relatively small group of worm-like animals that live in tropical forests. The results are published in the advance online edition of the journal nature.

            "One of the most bizarre-looking fossils ever found - a worm-like creature with legs, spikes and a head difficult to distinguish from its tail - has found its place in the evolutionary tree of life, definitively linking it with a group of modern animals for the first time. The animal, known as hallucigenia due to its otherworldly appearance, had been considered an ' evolutionary misfit ' as it was not clear how it related to modern animal groups. Researchers from the university of cambridge have discovered an important link with modern velvet worms, also known as onychophorans, a relatively small group of worm-like animals that live in tropical forests. The results are published in the advance online edition of the journal nature. The affinity of hallucigenia and other contemporary ' legged worms ', collectively known as lobopodians, has been very controversial, as a lack of clear characteristics linking them to each other or",

At least two palestinians were killed and 200 wounded as israeli border forces used riot control measures and live ammunition against thousands of demonstrators, reports the bbc. The palestinian authority has called for a \" day of rage \" over israel's gaza offensive and more clashes are expected today. Yesterday's demonstration took place after at least 15 people were killed and up to 200 injured when an israeli strike hit a united nations school sheltering people fleeing israeli bombing. The israeli military says it gave people the chance to leave before shelling began, but the un denies that, saying it tried and failed to negotiate a window of time during which people could safely leave, the guardian reports. John kerry has come up with a two-stage plan to end the fighting in gaza, an official involved in negotiations tells the new york times. The first step would involve a weeklong truce beginning on sunday, during which israeli, palestinian, and international negotiators would discuss issues affecting gaza. But negotiations are at a delicate stage, the official says, and issues like an israeli demand to keep its troops in gaza during the truce are still being discussed. Yesterday was one of the bloodiest days of the 18-day-old conflict, with 115 palestinians dead bringing the total to more than 800, the ap reports.

The jury was not told of her death until after passing its verdict: guilty on one count of indecent assault but not guilty on five others due to insufficient evidence regarding dates. Andrade had a difficult time on the witness stand under the grilling of a prosecuting attorney kate blackwell, who called her a liar and a fantasist. \" you are hugely insulting, even though it's your job, \" andrade told her.

Here are five revelations about tsarnaev from our latest cover story, \" jahar's world \": dropkick murphys donate $ 300,000 to boston victims • as jahar lay in the boat, surrounded by swat teams and police, fbi negotiators mentioned a public plea for his surrender from his former wrestling coach. An agent on the scene later told the coach that it could have been this name from the past – and the memory of that past – both of which were invoked during the standoff, that convinced jahar to ultimately give up. • around 2008, jahar's older brother tamerlan confided to his mother that he felt like \" two people \" were inside him.

An agent on the scene later told the coach that it could have been this name from the past – and the memory of that past – both of which were invoked during the standoff, that convinced jahar to ultimately give up. • around 2008, jahar's older brother tamerlan confided to his mother that he felt like \" two people \" were inside him. She confided this to a close friend who felt he might need a psychiatrist, but zubeidat believed that religion would be the cure for her son",
            "The august issue of rolling stone hasn't even hit newstands yet, but its cover is already stirring up controversy on social media. On the front of the magazine is dzhokhar tsarnaev, the surviving member of the duo of brothers alleged to have carried out the attacks on the boston marathon. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured in the blasts. The cover story is titled \" jahar's world \" and is described as \" a riveting and heartbreaking account of how a charming kid with a bright future became a monster. \" not surprising is the swift — and mostly negative — reaction to the cover's depiction of tsarnaev, and rolling stone is already taking plenty of heat on its facebook page. Here's some of the reaction so far: \" why give the guy the cover of rolling stone? time gave charles manson the cover and all the magazines carried pictures of the columbine shooters on the covers, too. Don't make martyrs out of these people. \"... \" very un-american. F -- k you rolling stone. I thought it was supposed to be an honor to be on your cover? \"... \" i shared this on my news feed, but not in support of your magazine, i shared it to show people how low you have gone"

        "summary": "Former nyc mayor michael bloomberg first took on big salt by setting up the national salt reduction initiative, which encourages restaurants and food manufacturers to voluntarily reduce the sodium found in their fare. Now current mayor bill de blasio's administration is getting into the act: the city's department of health is expected to propose today that the city that never sleeps takes a step toward becoming the city that never shakes by requiring chain restaurants to call out menu items that contain more than the recommended daily limit of sodium, which is currently 2,300mg, or about one teaspoon of salt, the ap reports. Those dishes would be designated by a salt-shaker-style icon on the restaurant's menu, which advocates of the plan say would give consumers the info they need to make more-educated decisions about what to order. Not everyone is thrilled with the idea. The head of the salt institute, an industry trade group, tells the ap it's \" misguided \" and uses \" faulty, incorrect government targets \" that could actually be harmful. And the president of the new york state restaurant association tells the new york times it would rub salt in the wounds of restaurants that are already heavily regulated. If the proposal goes through, 10 % or so of items on menus would get the salt-shaker designation, the paper notes. If the vote to consider the proposal is successful today, a final vote could come in september, with warnings appearing in restaurants by december, the ap reports. Meanwhile, on the left coast, san francisco passed legislation that requires health warnings on ads for sugary beverages, bans such promotions on public property, and prohibits city money from being used to purchase soda, nbc news reports. ( the salt controversy continues: some say too much is harmful, others say too little is. )",

The stat, released by the cdc thursday, is \" really surprising, \" an expert who analyzed the data tells the new york times. \" we think of traffic accidents as so commonplace. \" but they're becoming less common, while suicide is becoming more so: back in 1999, adolescents in that age range were four times more likely to die in a traffic accident than to die by their own hand. By 2014, the number of car accident deaths had been halved, but the number of suicides had almost doubled. One potential reason behind the increase in the suicide rate: social media. Where before just a handful of classmates may have been privy to an embarrassing moment, for example, now the news might quickly spread through an entire school — and beyond. There's also the fact that girls are hitting puberty earlier now than they did historically, and experts say they may be too young to handle the issues of sex, gender identity, and more that come along with that change. And, an expert tells wtvr, younger kids are more likely to commit self-harm impulsively. \" many people look for signs of depression \" as a warning sign of suicide, she says. \" teens ( who attempt suicide ) typically show mood swings and depression, but younger children are much more likely to suffer from ( attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ). \"",
