        "summary": "An official in taiwan has stepped down from her post after what looks to be a multimillion-dollar mistake involving hundreds of thousands of passports. Focus taiwan reports that agnes chen, the chief of the country's bureau of consular affairs, resigned wednesday after it was discovered the nation's new passport had on it a picture of dc's dulles international airport instead of taiwan's taoyuan international airport. The wrong image was imprinted on 200,000 new passports, which will now be sent back to the printer to be redone; 285 passports that were already handed out will be recalled. The washington post notes \" more than a passing resemblance \" between the two airports, citing an architectural website that says the designer of the taiwanese airport was \" influenced \" by the dc building, built 17 years earlier. Still, chen is taking the fall for the goof. \" i apologize to the public for the major oversight and will take full administrative responsibility for the incident, \" she said at a press conference. It's not clear how much it will cost to reprint the passports, but the original run ran about $ 2.7 million.",

At the show she performed \" ronan, \" a song that she's only sung publicly once, during the september 2012 stand up to cancer telethon. She explained the reason she was about to dust off the track to the crowd: ronan's mom was there. People reports that swift recounted reading maya thompson's blog, rockstar ronan, \" every night. And in it was this account of what it was like to watch cancer take over [ your ] life. \" the cancer, in this case, was stage iv neuroblastoma; ronan died in may 2011, three days before his fourth birthday. But he's there in the tribute song swift wrote ( which credits thompson as a co-writer ), one swift issued as a single in order to support the ronan thompson foundation and other cancer charities. She told the crowd that the song had additional meaning for her following her own mother's cancer diagnosis, and asked them to clap for thompson, who on instagram wrote, \" this will forever be one of the most special moments of my life. \" through the foundation thompson and her family are fighting to find a cure, and she continues to update the blog. It's an emotional read. In a may 2015 post, she wrote: \" so, almost 4 years later and what can i tell you? i can tell you this: life sometimes feels really hard. As in bring me to my knees, i ' m giving up hard.... I still have days where i am so angry at the stupidest things such as the sunshine, laughter from the television, or even the new star wars movie that is coming out because it kills me that you will not be here to see it.... I have learned a lot in the 4 years of your death.

In other healthcare.gov news: insurance companies are looking to take matters into their own hands, asking the government for a way to bypass the system to take on those who qualify for subsidies.

The panel deliberated for less than two hours before delivering the verdict in the lawsuit brought by baldwin and his friend, spyridon contogouris their lawyer had asked the eight-member jury to award the plaintiffs more than $ 17 million in damages. That's how much they estimate they would have received if they hadn't sold their shares in a company that marketed oil-separating centrifuges to bp before the oil giant made an $ 18 million deposit on a $ 52 million order for 32 of the devices. The jury gave them nothing. Costner, who smiled and shook his attorney's hand after the verdict, said he was grateful for the opportunity to clear his name. \" my name means more to me than money and that's why we didn't settle, \" he said shortly after the verdict.

A federal jury this evening rejected a claim by the actor stephen baldwin and his friend, spyridon contogouris, that costner and a business partner duped them by keeping them uninformed on a multimillion-dollar deal between costner's company, ocean therapy solutions, and the oil company bp. Baldwin and contogouris sold their shares in ocean therapy solutions before it sold cleanup devices to bp for use in the 2010 gulf of mexico oil spill. The pair's lawyer had asked the jury to award them $ 17 million in damages, according to the associated press. But after less than two hours of deliberations, the jury awarded baldwin and contogouris nothing.

But that's not exactly making legislators popular with protesters: \" they should go to hell and beyond, \" says a 65-year-old pensioner. \" they should ask me how i feel when i have to go to church to beg for food.

First, tye demonstrates the strength of a half-inch thick structural steel beam by using it to lift an anvil. Then he takes another piece of steel he says has been heated to 1,800 degrees and shows how it has become bendable, like \" a freaking noodle. \" in closing, tye declares: \" your argument is invalid. Get over it. Find a job. \" while it does show that steel beams don't need to melt to lose their integrity, tye's demonstration — \" more party trick than perfect simulation \" — does a have a few flaws, popular mechanics points out: the steel beam he used is heated to 1,800 degrees, 300 degrees hotter than jet fuel burns. Tye doesn't say for how long the beam was heated. He doesn't provide evidence of his forge's temperature. Those flaws, the daily dot notes, have already been seized upon by so-called 9/11 truthers in comments on the video, which has been viewed more than 6.5 million times, seeking to debunk tye's debunking.

The fed has long claimed its vaults hold the world's largest gold stockpile worth as much as $ 260 billion. But some \" wonder if the bank is hiding something about what it's hiding, \" in the words of the wall street journal. As one precious-metals analyst explains, the fed has \" never in its history provided any proof \" of its gold stores beneath lower manhattan. Visitors see only a sample of bars — which some suspect could be gold-plated tungsten of an equal weight — and only auditors and account holders are allowed to review records; the last audit of fed gold, involving 367 samples, was in 2012. Raising further suspicions are recent gold prices. Based on those, one investment strategist claims \" there has to have been a central bank spewing their gold into the market. \" some gold investors believe the fed could be secretly lending out its gold to keep prices down, though a fed spokesperson says it doesn't own any of the gold in its headquarters — most is owned by foreign governments — and \" does not use it in any way for any purposes including loaning or leasing it out. \" outsiders may not get any more clarity unless the \" audit the fed \" bill is passed.

Archibald allen lee hegner says he was trying to do just that a year ago when he was struck — he alleges deliberately — by a street-sweeping machine. Now he's suing the city and the driver, rodney ray fresquez, seeking compensation for emotional distress and the $ 116,000 cost of treating collision-related injuries, which the suit catalogs as including a traumatic brain injury, two broken ribs, a fractured sacrum, and a torso-length hematoma, the denver post reports. The lawsuit filed in us district court on monday describes something that sounds like a game of chicken. On the afternoon of feb. 29, 2016, hegner alleges he biked up to an idling street-sweeping machine and steered left around it, only to hear the engine rev and fresquez begin driving. Fresquez passed hegner on the right, then hegner says he biked harder and again passed on the left to avoid the dirt and branches being kicked his way. Then, the suit says, fresquez passed him again and \" suddenly, inexplicably, and without warning \" flipped the vehicle around 180 degrees, heading directly at hegner. Hegner claims he tried to bike up on the sidewalk to get out of the machine's path, but failed and was struck, causing a \" permanent impairment of his ability to enjoy a full and complete life, \" per the suit.

Researchers at a government agricultural institute say that contrary to a century of scientific belief, the holes are caused by hay particles, not bacteria, and modern milking is just too clean, the bbc reports. The researchers say that \" microscopically small \" flecks of hay that fell into milk-collecting buckets in barns helped the holes to form, and they were able to alter the number of holes in cheeses like emmental by changing the amount of hay dust they added to milk, reports the ap. Holes in swiss cheese have been vanishing over the last 15 years, and the researchers say this is because modern industrial milking methods don't expose the milk to open barn environments, let alone dirty buckets, swissinfo reports. The hole question has been around for a while: american scientist william clark published research in 1917 stating that bacteria caused the holes to form, reports the bbc, which notes that the latest swiss research hasn't been peer-reviewed, so other scientists haven't had a chance to find holes in it yet.

The farmers, upset at slashed government funding, had blocked the road with hay bales — and themselves — as the main pack of riders approached. Officers clearing the road used liberal doses of tear gas or pepper spray, and it was still in the air by the time riders arrived. The race had to stop completely for 15 minutes as several riders received treatment, mainly drops to their eyes, reports the guardian. Among them was british cyclist chris froome, who isn't having an easy time of it at the tour.

Until now. In a new study, mcdowell argues the karman line is at least 20 % closer, or 50 miles away, and presents some straightforward data to back that up, per live science. If the karman line really is 62 miles away, says mcdowell, it should've been impossible for the soviet elektron-4 satellite to orbit earth 10 times at a distance of 52 miles, as it did before disintegrating in 1997. And that's just one of 50 examples of satellites making multiple rotations of earth at altitudes below 62 miles that mcdowell uncovered while surveying the orbital paths of 43,000 satellites since 1957, reports sciencealert. Plugging the data into a mathematical model, mcdowell found satellites tend to break from orbit 41 to 55 miles above earth, though a fiery descent is all but guaranteed at 50 miles. This is believed to be the outer edge of the mesosphere, which extends 53 miles above earth, according to nasa. \" adding to the evidence that this is the region where the atmosphere becomes important \" is the fact that meteors, traveling faster than satellites, disintegrate in the range of 43 to 62 miles, says mcdowell. If his data is correct, \" you may be a little bit closer to the heavens \" than you thought, per live science. But mcdowell is considering greater implications, including what the karman line's positioning might mean for countries ' airspace: if a us satellite flies \" at 52 miles over china, for example, that could be ( justifiably ) construed as an act of military aggression, \" he says.

Now the big question: how many of the state's 95 delegates up for grabs will he be able to win by night's end? getting all or most would keep him in the running to secure the magic number of 1,237 ahead of the gop convention. Delegates are doled out via congressional districts, and for a clean sweep, trump would have to win 50 % of the vote in each district. Early overall returns suggested he could well pull it off: he had 63 % of the vote, followed by kasich at 23 % and cruz at 14 %. Nbc and fox are projecting a second-place finish for kasich. In a speech to supporters, trump thanked new yorkers, \" the people who know me best, \" for the landslide win. \" we don't have much of a race anymore, \" he said of the overall gop contest. He also credited his \" evolving \" campaign team, a nod to a recent high-level shakeup amid what the washington post calls \" staff turmoil \" and worries that his team wasn't organized enough about securing delegates.

Two years after adopting a six-hour workday, the swedish city of gothenburg says it will end the experiment over cost concerns, though it appeared to make workers happier and more productive. Indeed, in the first 18 months, 68 nurses at a gothenburg care home for seniors with dementia who switched from eight- to six-hour workdays but kept the same salary reported feeling more fulfilled, less tired, and took 6 % fewer sick days than nurses working 40 hours per week at a hospital, reports inverse. Patients also reported improved care, while social activities at the facility increased by 80 %. But all that came at a cost, reports bloomberg: gothenburg had to pay $ 1.3 million to hire 17 additional staff to fill out the workday. Instead of teams of four working eight-hour shifts together, teams of five were scheduled in overlapping shifts. And the expense wasn't worth the benefit. \" i personally believe in shorter working hours as a long-term solution \" but \" it's far too expensive to carry out a general shortening of working hours within a reasonable time frame, \" says a local politician.

Bertram, a phd student on an extended leave from the school of public administration at the university of gothenburg, may not have gone looking for attention but he found it by seeking innovation, a traditional activity in gothenburg, where sweden's old labor norms have historically gone to die. When bernmar became the man responsible for his city's six-hour workday experiment, he also became a prominent supporter of an idea thats audience — if not time — has come. Bernmar, a member of the left party, is a reformer by nature who thinks work-time innovations can make both swedish citizens and the",
            "Pexels - cc0 after year-long trial at the retirement home sjöjungfrun in umeå, sweden, it is apparent that the six-hour work day didn't achieve any of what was hoped for. Similar to the experiment at the svartedalen retirement home in gothenburg, which was also completed this year, nurses at sjöjungfrun in umeå had six-hour days on eight-hour salaries for a year. Ad proponents of shorter work days in sweden, like the sociologist roland paulsen of lund university, argue that the ever increasing productivity of society means that in the long run there wont be enough employment to go around for eight hours per person per day, and a that on average two hours of any person's work day is filled with unproductive labor anyways. The umeå experiment was motivated by ( political ) expectations that reduced working hours would lead to increased personal health and well-being, compensating increased costs - and"

But ahead of to the bone's release friday on netflix, plenty are discussing whether the film does more harm than good. Some reactions: though to the bone currently has an 81 % rating from 21 critics on rotten tomatoes, peter bradshaw says it's \" notable only for its sheer extravagant awfulness. \" writing at the guardian, he calls the film \" trite, shallow, cautiously middlebrow, and blandly complicit in the cult of female prettiness that it is supposedly criticizing. \" ignatiy vishnevetsky at the av club notes \" how little the movie actually addresses ellen's condition \" and leaves the impression only of \" a pretty face \" and \" a body hung in chic, loose clothes. \" christine morgan of the butterfly foundation, which offers support for eating disorders, adds the film's \" graphic representations \" raise \" a very real risk of copycat behavior, \" per the huffington post. She wants to see netflix add a warning to the film. Kristina saffran of project heal, which helps fund treatment for people suffering from eating disorders, offers a different take. \" triggers are everywhere in eating disorder recovery, \" she tells the washington post, adding \" it would have been impossible to make any sort of film that didn't have the potential to trigger somebody who is struggling. \" per the ap, claire mysko of the national eating disorders association notes eating disorders are a \" serious public health issue \" that will affect 30 million americans in their lifetimes, so \" having eating disorders discussed on a national platform like this is really important. \" the film isn't just important, but also really good, adds tomris laffly at film journal international. It's \" refreshingly well-considered, \" portrays eating disorders as \" addiction-related mental and physical ailments that rob people of a normal life, \" and is \" ultimately optimistic, \" she writes. But specific concerns have been made about collins, who has admitted to struggling with eating disorders and had to lose weight for the role of ellen, reports usa today. Collins, however, says the weight loss was necessary \" to tell this story \" and done safely with oversight from a nutritionist, filmmakers, and her mother.",

That's not exactly how it went down, as the edited hill headline makes clear. What to know about the 29 voicemails included in the dnc dump: the last line in politico's piece notes that \" it does not appear, however, that the audio files \" are new. On the contrary, wikileaks tweeted about them on friday. The link in that tweet is identical to the link in one posted wednesday night declaring \" release: the dnc recordings. \" it seems many media outlets took this to mean \" new. \" the only difference with the new tweet: it added a link to an abc news video on youtube. So they're probably not new, but what do they say? gawker calls them \" boring as hell, \" pointing out that they aren't voicemails left between dnc staffers, but are calls placed by americans to dnc headquarters. The first one, at 16 seconds, might be a butt dial. It features a conversation between an adult and child who can be heard saying \" bring in the elephant, zookeeper \" and \" i want to see the elephants. \" quips the register: \" after extensive analysis, the register's forensics squad believes that the two people in the conversation are talking about actual elephants and not talking in code about the republican party's elephant logo. \" also, 14 of the 29 are less than 20 seconds long. Motherboard points out there are really only 25 ( four are duplicates ). Motherboard cites two notable callers: gloria allred and former ambassador to austria william eacho, who was asking about a dinner with obama. The hill says the lot includes \" innocuous greetings, \" but points out a few are aimed at bernie sanders and the preferential treatment the callers felt he was being given. Says one: \" i ' m furious for what you are doing for bernie sanders. He's getting way too much influence. \" fortune notes the mp3 files were posted with the caller's phone number shown.",

        "summary": "Scientists think they finally know what causes sea star wasting syndrome, the disease that's killing off starfish in massive numbers. In a new study, researchers from a number of universities have linked the devastating disease — which causes starfish to rip off their own arms and dissolve into piles of goo — to a waterborne densovirus. \" what we're dealing with are animals that are crawling with bacteria and other microorganisms, \" says the lead author of the study, which looked at 465 sea stars, both healthy and diseased. \" trying to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any specific virus is responsible for the disease is a really big challenge because you can't isolate it away from those native bacteria. But our evidence is very strong that it's a sea star associated densovirus. \" researchers noticed that even sea stars in captivity were coming down with the wasting syndrome, notes livescience, seemingly when something got through an aquarium's intake filtration system, which caused them to think an \" infectious agent \" was behind it. They tested dna from healthy and sick starfish and detected the presence of the densovirus in the infected samples, then did more testing to confirm their hypothesis — including infecting some healthy starfish with the densovirus; the wasting syndrome set in within 10 days. The next step: figure out exactly how the virus attacks sea star tissue and identify the trigger for the recent outbreaks, which have depleted populations in some areas by as much as 99 %. The virus has likely been \" smoldering \" in sea stars for some time, phys.org explains, and the recent epidemic could have been triggered by starfish overpopulation, changes to the environment, or even a virus mutation.

Each case of ebola usually infects only 1.5 to 2.0 others when no one is vaccinated. By contrast, hiv infects 2 to 4, and measles, one of the worst, infects about 18.",

        "summary": "What happens when a group of childhood friends continues playing tag, often at inopportune times, well into adulthood? here's what critics ( who are split 60-40 on rotten tomatoes ) are saying about jeff tomsic's tag, starring a host of funny people from isla fisher to hannibal buress: \" looking for a light summer comedy? chase down another movie, \" writes bruce demara at the toronto star. He takes issue with the direction and casting, finding fisher's character \" too over the top \" and jake johnson's plain \" annoying. \" but the screenplay \" is probably the main culprit, with dialogue that provokes groans rather than belly laughs, \" demara writes. Katie walsh disagrees. Based on a 2013 wall street journal article about a real-life friend group, tag is \" the kind of frothy escapist fare that goes down easy on a hot summer day \" and \" like the game itself, a whole lot of rambunctious fun, \" she writes at the los angeles times. Her biggest complaint is that several personas \" verge on typecasting. \" not only is tag full of \" great, dumb pleasures, \" but it's \" relentlessly funny \" — \" a fine callback to the sprawling ensemble comedies of the 1980s, \" writes amy nicholson at the guardian. While the film could've done without the role of a wsj reporter, buress is the \" underwritten sidekick who steals scenes by mumbling the best jokes. \" and \" surprisingly, there's emotional resonance, \" too. You might think colin covert saw a different movie. \" tag feels like a small-screen experience that aimed high and fell short. It's equally diverting and disappointing, \" he writes at the minneapolis star-tribune. Like demara, he blames a \" flaccid script, \" noting, \" this is a film that thinks that the idea of genitals is so hilarious it must be trotted out at 10-minute intervals. \" and still, \" a sense of madcap fun is conspicuously absent. \"",

A taxi driver tried to ram one of the attackers he saw stabbing a woman but missed. And an off-duty police officer — and rugby player — tackled one of the attackers; he's in critical condition.

Fire department used a chainsaw to cut open the steel cage door and arrest him. Bronner was charged with possession of marijuana and blocking passage. Bronner, whose california-based company uses hemp oil in its soap products, pleaded with president obama — via microphone — to allow hemp harvesting in the u. S. Bronner was moved to protest after a recent 28,000-signature petition asking for hemp legalization didn't get the response he wanted, according to bronner spokesman ryan fletcher. The protest began at 8 a.m. When bronner and his caged trailer was dropped off on h street next to lafayette square. Park police and secret service agents joined d.c. Police and fire officials, who worked for a couple of hours to open the cage. Bronner had designed the trailer so it could not easily be broken into or towed away by police, said fletcher. Atop the trailer was a sign that read \"dear mr. President. Let u.s. Farmers grow hemp! \" bronner's actions also prompted",
            "Washington -- david bronner had been camped out in a steel cage in front of lafayette park for almost three hours before a truck full of firemen came to remove him forcibly with a chainsaw. The long-haired president of dr. Bronner's magic soaps, a top-selling natural soap chain based in escondido, calif., was holding court in an 64-square-foot cage to draw attention to the federal prohibition on growing industrial hemp, a policy which fails to distinguish between oilseed and fiber varieties of cannabis. For bronner, that means spending over $ 100,000 a year importing from canadian farmers the hemp oil he'd rather be buying domestically. \" obama has promised a rational approach to policies, \" he said into a microphone hooked up to his cage. \" so far as president he has blown off the u.s. Hemp industry. \" more than a dozen members of the u.s. Park police stood outside bronner's cage monday morning, trying to cut the metal with giant red clippers. They then called a tow truck that was unable to move the cage, and at one point threatened to arrest huffpost for stepping into the street to take a photo. Inside the cage with bronner were a dozen industrial hemp plants, which, bronner said, all contained less than 0.3 percent thc, in accordance with canadian regulations and had no potential use"

She then spent 10 minutes doing her make-up, adjusting her bra, and fixing her hair before putting her shirt back on and leaving. In tmz's version of the story, bynes actually got kicked out of the class by the irate instructor.

Radar reports that bynes ' parents haven't heard from her in months, and are worried. But sources say they haven't moved from texas to california to help their daughter, as has been reported. Bynes was in court yesterday, and the judge warned that if she breaks any more road laws, she ' ll impose bail. Click to read about why we all should have seen this meltdown coming two years ago.",

I was accused by, i believe it was four women... Who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me. I've had a lot of false charges against me. \" cnn notes at least 17 women have accused trump of sexual assault. Trump touched on quite a few other subjects during the press conference, including deputy attorney general rod rosenstein, whom he said he would \" certainly prefer not to \" fire, the ap reports.

What he's referring to: a report in the new york times this week that the fbi planted an informant to spy on his campaign during the 2016 election. Politico notes the president and his allies are now using this report to sow doubt about the validity of robert mueller's probe into russian interference in the election, as well as possible ties between russia and trump associates. \" this has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame donald trump for crimes he didn't commit, \" trump quote-tweeted fox business network anchor david asman friday morning. \" really bad stuff! \" he added as his own take. More from around the internet: the original times story notes that current and former fbi officials have said \" at least one government informant \" met up multiple times with trump associates carter page and george papadopoulos, which has led some in trump's camp to cry attempted entrapment. Still, sources in the doj and fbi say agents weren't nearly as aggressive as they could have been. The article also notes the russia investigation's initial code name: crossfire hurricane, taken from the lyrics of the rolling stones song \" jumpin ' jack flash. \" earlier this month, the washington post noted a \" rare moment of alignment \" between trump and the justice department he's been battling with: an agreement not to turn over sensitive doj info to house intelligence committee chair devin nunes for fear of outing a \" top-secret intelligence source \" and putting lives at risk. Now that it's been revealed that source spilled info to robert mueller, some administration officials fear trump may soon reverse course and give nunes what he wants.",

Among the numbers it cites from the aviation safety network: worldwide, 22 fatal crashes had been reported this year as of yesterday, down from 28 last year and from a 10-year average of 34. None were in the us, a streak that goes back to 2009. Only 10 of those involved passenger planes, and just three of those were made in the west. The total of 470 fatalities is down from the 10-year-average of 770. The rate of one fatal accident per 2.5 million flights is nearly twice as safe as last year's previous record. The improved numbers come as more people are flying — 2.9 billion in 2012, up 5.5 % from 2011. Africa, latin america, and the caribbean have work to do: those regions accounted for 7 % of the world's passenger traffic but about half of the year's airline accidents. Update: the number of fatal accidents is rising by one: a passenger plane went off the runway at moscow airport this morning and caught fire, killing four of the eight aboard, reports ap.",

In 2005, another man admitted to the crime — but only today was the teenager's conviction ruled wrongful, reuters reports. The teen, named huugjilt, made his confession after 48 hours of interrogation in china, presstv reports. But the court says the confession didn't match the evidence, including findings from an autopsy. An official with the court in inner mongolia, an autonomous region within china, has given huugjilt's parents some $ 4,850 following the renewed verdict. According to state news via the south china morning post, huugjilt and a friend were walking by a public restroom when they heard yelling; as huugjilt tried to help, the two found a woman's body, the friend says. \" we learnt a heart-breaking lesson in this case; we are sorry, \" the court official told the weeping parents, who have been trying to have the case retried since 2006. A criminal law expert in china says \" this shows the spirit behind judicial reform in our country and that the will to pursue justice exists — that's a good thing. \" but reformers say china must go further by abolishing the death penalty, stopping government influence over court decisions, and banning police torture for confessions ( which is illegal but still happens, a professor says ). Meanwhile, huugjilt's parents visited their son's grave and ripped up a copy of the verdict. \" the wrongful conviction has been redressed, \" they wrote online. At the grave, his mother wept in a video posted by the beijing news: \" i knew you were innocent, but i could not help you; i miss you so much, \" she says.

Levinson, a former federal agent working as a private investigator, hasn't been seen since a hostage video taken in 2010 shows him with a long beard and bearing a sign reading \" help me. \" if he is still alive, as his family believes, he would be 69.

Wife christine levinson \" has had nightmares about his torture. \" family attorney david mcgee tells the sun sentinel, \" all the family wants is justice. \" the suit seeks unspecified damages but, mcgee adds, \" if they send him back, they can keep their damn money. \" iran has denied any involvement in levinson's imprisonment, though us officials believe otherwise. There was no comment from the white house, but the legal action could provoke a confrontation with iran, the times notes. Although the obama administration didn't challenge iran over levinson, trump vowed on the campaign trail to bring the freelance spy home and levinson's family has said they hope his negotiating skills could win his freedom. Levinson was not part of a 2016 prisoner exchange that coincided with the landmark nuclear deal, though questions were raised about how much iran knew about his whereabouts.",

            "If you are a critic of the bush administration, chances are that, at some point over the past six months, ron paul has said something that appealed to you. Paul describes himself as a libertarian, but, since his presidential campaign took off earlier this year, the republican congressman has attracted donations and plaudits from across the ideological spectrum. Antiwar conservatives, disaffected centrists, even young liberal activists have all flocked to paul, hailing him as a throwback to an earlier age, when politicians were less mealy-mouthed and american government was more modest in its ambitions, both at home and abroad. In the new york times magazine, conservative writer christopher caldwell gushed that paul is a \"formidable stander on constitutional principle, \" while the nation wrote of \"his full-throated rejection of the imperial project in iraq. \" former tnr editor andrew sullivan endorsed paul for the gop nomination, and abc's jake tapper described the candidate as \"the one true straight-talker in this race. \" even the wall street journal, the newspaper of the elite bankers whom paul detests, recently advised other republican presidential contenders not to \"dismiss the passion he's tapped. \" most voters had never heard of paul before he launched his quixotic bid for the republican nomination. But the texan has been active in politics for decades. And, long before he was the darling",

The teacher in question, dayanna volitich, has been removed from her classroom at crystal river middle school in crystal river pending an investigation.

It summarizes one exchange in which dalichov's guest, white nationalist lana lokteff, suggests it's ludicrous to think \" a kid from nigeria and a kid who came from sweden \" have the same iq. Huffpost describes dalichov as \" enthusiastically \" agreeing, claiming \" science \" has confirmed some races have superior iqs, and it reports she also claimed to have shared her ideology with her students and lied about doing so when confronted by administrators. It goes on to outline similarities between what it could find online about dalichov — her age, hometown, and general teaching history — and volitich. Nbc news reports a lawyer for volitich did indeed confirm the women are one and the same, but through the lawyer, volitich said the podcast was a work of \" political satire and exaggeration \" and that dalichov's views \" do not pervade my professional career. \"",

Dan brown, general manager of seaworld adventure park, speaks to the press today regarding a trainer who was killed at seaworld in orlando, fla., wednesday, feb. 24, 2010, by a killer whale. The death of a veteran sea world trainer in orlando, fla., wednesday has spotlighted the campaign of several major animal rights groups to keep marine mammals out of theme parks altogether. Dawn brancheau was killed when a 12,300-lb. Male orca \"killer whale \" grabbed her in front of an audience at the orlando theme park. Now, animal rights activists say that many questions should be asked in the wake of ms. Brancheau's death. Sea world has said that the very same orca is responsible for human deaths in 1991 and again in 1999. The humane society of the united states has long campaigned for marine mammals to be removed from theme parks. \"these behemoths are denied all of their natural, instinctual inclinations, and we humans tend to think, 'well, this is just a bad animal. ' but it is a wild animal, used to running free in an entire ocean, but now confined to a very small"

        "summary": "Super tuesday is upon us — and it could be the day that changes the republican party forever. With 11 states holding gop primaries and caucuses, rival candidates are doing their best to dent donald trump, but the party establishment fears that the time when his candidacy could be stopped is already in the past. On the democratic side, meanwhile, hillary clinton and bernie sanders will battle for 11 states plus american samoa, and analysts say it will require victory in a few close-run contests for sanders to keep his candidacy afloat. A roundup of coverage: fivethirtyeight has a detailed guide to every state voting in the republican and democratic contests, including poll numbers — which suggest both front-runners are headed toward huge wins. With trump poised to win up to 10 states, politico looks at how his momentum has split republican leaders, and at what marco rubio and ted cruz plan to do in the days ahead. The wall street journal looks at why massachusetts will be a must-win for bernie sanders. The ap has a guide to when results will start rolling in. Caucus states minnesota, colorado, and alaska may experience more hiccups than others. Fox news takes a closer look at the states where victory will be most important, including texas, the biggest prize and possibly cruz's only win. It's also primary day for democrats living overseas. The ap talks to voters in new zealand, where super tuesday arrived first. Politico breaks down five numbers it says will define super tuesday, including rubio's share of the vote in northern virginia. The washington post reports on sanders ' jabs at clinton on the eve of super tuesday. He has vowed to stay in the race until all 50 states have voted. Peter beinart at the atlantic has three reasons why liberals in states that allow non-republicans to vote in gop primaries should give up their chance to vote for sanders or clinton and cast a ballot for marco rubio. Today is do or die for cruz, according to the national review, which explains how he managed to paint himself into this corner. The new york times looks at the gop's revamped delegate selection, designed to \" turbocharge the campaign of a front-runner \" — and at how it could help trump wrap things up very quickly.",

Cane sugar undergoes a refining process that makes it white, and the process often involves the use of bone char, which typically comes from cows ' pelvic bones, mother nature network reports. ( granulated carbon or an ion exchange system can also be used as filters, notes vegetarian journal, but the \" efficient \" and \" economical \" bone char is the most popular filter. ) a process of grinding and then heating them creates the carbon that's used to filter the sugar; a commercial filter can contain as much as 70,000 pounds of char. You aren't actually consuming bone char when you eat the sugar — there's contact, but the end result is free of it — but vegans looking to avoid it need not give up the ingredient. There are a number of animal-free options. If you buy a bag that's certified usda organic, for instance, bone char won't have been used to make it. Or you can opt for 100 % pure beet sugar; its refining process doesn't include char, and the usda reports that for the last two decades, sugar beets have made up about 55 % of domestic sugar production to sugarcane's 45 %. Sugar that's labeled \" raw \" or \" unrefined \" is also a good bet, as is sugar made with \" evaporated cane juice, \" mnn notes. Product lists like this one from ordinary vegan and this one from peta can offer some help, too. Things get more complicated when you buy foods that already have sugar in them, since makers might mix different kinds of sugar. ( you might want to just try cutting down on sugar, period. )",

The reality, as told by their time diaries, was a lot lighter and less balanced: about 10 more hours a week for men to women's 21, writes kamp dush ( herself a tenured professor and mother of four ) at the conversation. How yavorsky sums it up in an osu article: \" the birth of the child dramatically changed the division of labor in these couples. What was once a relatively even division of household work no longer looked that way. \" neither men nor women reported working less at their job, post-baby. The findings appear in the journal of marriage and family and were based on a somewhat slim pool of data: a total of just four diary entries per participant in which they logged 24 hours of activity on one weekday and one weekend; they recorded the activity once during the third trimester and once 9 months after birth.

They were then shown 3,441 faces of famous people and recognized 800 on average.

Reporting in the journal memory &amp; cognition, she and colleagues say that we shouldn't blame distraction or exhaustion or some mental failing. It all comes down to the way the human brain catalogs names — we essentially shelve them away in folders based on how well we know and love people. When we mess up a name, it's typically because we inadvertently choose a different one from the same folder. The researchers also found \" phonetic similarity between the incorrect name used by the misnamer and the correct name also plays a role in misnaming, \" though the effect was less pronounced than the category effect. \" it's a normal cognitive glitch, \" samantha deffler tells npr.

So she, and her colleagues, cassidy fox, christin ogle, and senior researcher david rubin, did a survey of 1,700 men and women of different ages, and she found that naming mistakes are very common. Most everyone sometimes mixes up the names of family and friends. Their findings were published in the journal memory &amp; cognition. \" it's a normal cognitive glitch, \" deffler says. It's not related to a bad memory or to aging, but rather to how the brain categorizes names. It's like having special folders for family names and friends names stored in the brain.

Is it because we're distracted and not fully paying attention? do we somehow confuse people in our minds, even if they're not much alike physically or in terms of their personality? why do we sometimes call people by the wrong names? luckily, science has an answer — it's largely to do with how your brain keeps itself organized. Cognitive scientist samantha deffler, from rollins college in florida, discovered after surveying 1,700 participants that mixing up people's names is more common than we knew. Half said they had been called by the wrong name by someone close to them, with 95 percent saying it was a family member who made the mix-up.

A lot of people mix up children's names or friends ' names, but deffler is a cognitive scientist at rollins college, in winter park, fla., and she wanted to find out why it happens. So she, and her colleagues, cassidy fox, christin ogle, and senior researcher david rubin, did a survey of 1,700 men and women of different ages, and she found that naming mistakes are very common. Most everyone sometimes mixes up the names of family and friends. Their findings were published in the journal memory &amp; cognition. \" it's a normal cognitive glitch, \" deffler says. It's not related to a bad memory or to aging, but rather to how the brain categorizes names. It's like having special folders for family names and friends names stored in the brain. When people used the wrong name, overwhelmingly the name that was used was in the same category, deffler says. It was in the same folder. And there was",

It's left many of us wondering why we sometimes mix up people's names. Is it because we're distracted and not fully paying attention? do we somehow confuse people in our minds, even if they're not much alike physically or in terms of their personality? why do we sometimes call people by the wrong names? luckily, science has an answer — it's largely to do with how your brain keeps itself organized. Cognitive scientist samantha deffler, from rollins college in florida, discovered after surveying 1,700 participants that mixing up people's names is more common than we knew. Half said they had been called by the wrong name by someone close to them, with 95 percent saying it was a family member who made the mix-up. But why? here's the deal: we have a tendency to mentally file everyone to metaphorical folders in our brains. When we place people in the same folder, we can sometimes unintentionally switch their names. That would explain why my mother,"

Robinett was released from an arizona prison in 2009 after a seven-year stint for bank robbery, and instead of going to a halfway house as required, he simply disappeared. He continued his crime spree in washington and oregon, komo notes, and even came close to being caught at least two other times before his 2014 capture, but he eluded cops.

When this refurbished dragon reaches the orbiting lab on monday, it will be the first returning craft since nasa's now-retired shuttles.

        "summary": "Sickened customers and employees, bad publicity, and tumbling stock prices were apparently just the beginning of chipotle's woes. Now the restaurant chain has been slapped with a federal subpoena as part of a criminal investigation into a food poisoning outbreak in august, the ap reports. The subpoena received in december mandates that chipotle produce \" a broad range of documents \" in regard to a norovirus outbreak at its restaurant in simi valley, calif., which bloomberg notes sickened 234 customers and workers. In an sec filing, chipotle says the investigation is being performed by the us attorney's office for the central district of california and the fda. A food safety lawyer says that a criminal probe following such an outbreak isn't typical, and that the only reason the feds might get involved is if there were employment infractions. This case isn't even the most publicized of chipotle's recent health scares: a norovirus outbreak in boston sickened more than 140 college students in late 2015, and an e. Coli outbreak in nine states sickened more than 50, bloomberg notes. The company's numbers are already hurting: shares are down 37 % over the past three months, per the wall street journal, and fox news reports that chipotle predicts sales will fall 14.6 % for 2015's fourth quarter — the first drop since the company went public in 2006. Chipotle says future sales could be \" significantly influenced by further developments \" and notes it will report sales for the quarter and full year on feb. 2, per the journal. A chipotle rep tells the ap it will cooperate fully with the probe. ( here's how chipotle is trying to fix its food issues. )",

Mccarthy was the heavy favorite to succeed the retiring john boehner at the end of the month, though he faced long-shot challenges from reps. Jason chaffetz and daniel webster, the latter being the nominee of the conservative house freedom caucus. Republicans were supposed to pick their nominee thursday, but mccarthy's announcement forced the vote to be postponed. Even had he won this vote, it was unclear whether mccarthy would be able to get the necessary 218 votes when the full house voted on oct. 29 — thanks to the conservative opposition from within his own party. \" i think i shocked some of you, \" mccarthy said to reporters afterward, per the hill. \" i don't want to go to the floor and win with 220 votes. I think best thing for our party is to win with 247 votes. \" mccarthy, who said he would remain in his post as majority leader, said republicans needed a \" new face \" to rally around.

But while reagan's naming of sen. Richard schweiker of pennsylvania slowed down gerald ford's momentum, reagan still ended up losing the nomination, notes the boston globe, which calls the tactic the \" grandest diversionary ploy a candidate can stage. \" and unlike cruz, reagan waited until after the primaries to name his choice. A roundup of reactions: politico calls the attention-grabbing move a \" desperate gambit \" from a candidate who had been mathematically eliminated from winning enough delegates for the nomination less than 24 hours earlier. Chris cillizza at the washington post also considers the move a \" desperate attempt to retake the momentum in the race before it's too late, \" but he credits cruz for trying it. With the choice of fiorina, cruz has brought a woman, a californian, and a relatively effective \" attack dog \" on board, cillizza notes. The national review calls the ploy \" an attempt to infuse a jolt of energy and excitement into a flagging candidacy, \" but it notes that cruz appears to have \" genuine chemistry \" with fiorina, who will hit the campaign trail in california on friday. The choice of fiorina could \" present a perilous challenge \" for donald trump, according to the new york times, which notes trump has come under fire for derogatory comments about women and that another \" slashing remark \" about fiorina's appearance \" could have grave consequences \" for him.

According to reports in french media, phone records have revealed that bouhlel met both men and women, including a 73-year-old man, through dating sites. Relatives say bouhlel suffered from mental illness and was radicalized in just two weeks by an isis recruiter. David canter, director of britain's international research center for investigative psychology tells the ap that bouhlel appears to be more of a \" spree killer, \" like the columbine shooters, than a terrorist.

            "Palm beach, fla. ( reuters ) - president donald trump's deputy national security adviser, k.t. Mcfarland, is expected to step down and has been offered the position of u.s. Ambassador to singapore, a u.s. Official said on sunday. Kathleen troia \" k.t. \" mcfarland arrives at trump tower in new york, u.s., january 3, 2017. Reuters/mike segar the move will be seen as a victory for trump's national security adviser, h.r. Mcmaster, who is retooling the national security team he inherited from retired lieutenant general michael flynn, who resigned as trump's first national security adviser in february. Mcfarland, 65, is a former national security analyst for fox news and was one of trump's original hires after he won the presidential election on nov. 8. The exact date of her departure was unclear, said the u.s. Official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. News of her pending departure came less than a week after trump removed his chief strategist, steve bannon, from the national security council at mcmaster's urging. Bannon had a seat on the council's \"principals committee, \" which included the secretaries of state, defense and other ranking aides. Flynn was forced to resign on feb. 13 over his contacts with russia's ambassador to the united states, sergey kislyak",

        "summary": "If the sun was calm when you were born, you might look forward to a longer life than someone born in a period of high solar activity. The sun's cycles last about 11 years, typically including three years of \" solar maximum \" — when activity like solar flares, sunspots, and solar storms are at their peak — and eight years of \" solar minimum. \" in a new study in the proceedings of the royal society b, researchers looked at demographic data of norwegians born between 1676 and 1878, and found that the lifespans of those born during \" solar maximum \" periods were, on average, 5.2 years shorter than the lifespans of people born during \" solar minimum \" periods, phys.org reports. \" solar activity at birth decreased the probability of survival to adulthood, \" thus causing the decrease in average lifespan, the researchers say. A high percentage of the deaths of those born during \" solar maximums \" occurred by age 2. The authors think ultraviolet radiation is behind the effect. Solar activity is linked to higher levels of uv radiation, which is known to have an impact on survival and reproduction; the authors say there's a possibility that's because it causes cell and dna damage. There's also evidence suggesting uv radiation degrades vitamin b9, or folic acid — and a shortage of that vitamin before birth has been linked to higher illness and death rates. Interestingly, the study also found that being born during \" solar maximum \" significantly reduced fertility for women and decreased the number of children they had who survived to adulthood — but only if those women were born into a poor population, suggesting that more well-to-do women may have been better able to avoid the sun or mitigate the sun's harmful effects through a healthier diet. A good rule of thumb? \" if you are pregnant, don't get a tan, \" says one co-author, according to livescience. ( another recent study finds that if you feel younger than your age, you ' ll likely live longer. )",

The \" yeas \" counted for 157 out of 212 votes cast, though the newspaper notes the vote was \" informal, \" and the new york daily news says it's \" not legally binding \" ( the village board will meet tuesday to decide where to go from here ). In response to public outcry that the image is racist and offensive to native americans, mayor patrick o ' connor showed up to the vote with other logo possibilities, including one that showed white and the oneida tribe member in a more cheerful interaction — clasping hands — against what the daily news describes as \" a tranquil landscape scene. \" there were also, as wktv notes, some more bizarre options, including a collage of ex-nhl goalie bobby esche, who lives in whitesboro; a depiction that transformed white and the native american into lucha libre-style wrestlers; and one in which the two men teamed up to beat on a british soldier. Many residents who spoke to wktv after the vote — which the station notes was also attended by crew from the daily show and the nightly show — said it was wrong to try to change the town's history. \" political correctness, who cares? \" one voter said, while another added, \" the indian and the white man wrestling... Both appreciated it, and enjoyed it. It was a good thing. \" but elizabeth brigham, who designed an alternate, more serene logo showing the erie canal, disagreed. \" my generation is growing in a way where we are asking for more equality and peace, \" she said. \" and unfortunately our original logo doesn't always depict that to people who don't live here. \"",

Two big takeaways from the 2016 survey of 101,000 people: white christians no longer make up a majority of americans, with their percentage now at 43 %, down from 81 % in 1976; and fewer than half of us states have a majority population of white christians. More details being emphasized: no affiliation: in 20 states, people with no religious affiliation outnumber those of any single religious affiliation, with vermont ( 41 % ), oregon ( 36 % ), and washington ( 35 % ) leading the way. But the atlantic is surprised to see that alaska and hawaii are on this list, too: \" in general, the non-religious states of america are concentrated west of the mississippi river. \" racial trend: quartz sees one major theme: \" religion in white america is dying, while religion in non-white america is holding strong. \" expect that to continue: the religions with the highest percentage of members ages 18 to 29 are islam ( 42 % ) and hinduism ( 36 % ), far higher than white catholics ( 11 % ), white evangelical protestants ( 11 % ), and white mainline protestants ( 14 % ). Still small numbers: non-christian religious groups may be growing, but they still represent less than 10 % of americans. Jewish americans are at 2 %, with muslims, buddhists, and hindus each at 1 %. All other non-christian religions amount to another 1 %. Politics: usa today notes that white christians still make up nearly three-quarters of the gop. In contrast, they constitute less than one-third of democrats, down from about half 10 years ago. Both parties face big challenges with the religious shift taking place, and fivethirtyeight looks at the challenges for both. For example, democrats have an increasingly varied base, which means they must craft a message that appeals to all, including those with no affiliation.

Billions of cicadas with a 17-year life span have spent the entire 21st century underground in ohio, new york, pennsylvania, maryland, virginia, and west virginia, reports fox news.

Death will follow three to five weeks after the cicadas have been above ground. Once the cicada eggs hatch, the ant-sized nymphs will head underground to suck sap from tree roots just like their parents and only emerge in spring 2033, reports the cleveland plain dealer.
