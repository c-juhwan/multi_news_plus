Now her parents are suing her school district, alleging mallory's cyberbullying at the hands of her classmates at copeland middle school pushed her to take her own life — and that the school didn't do enough to prevent it. \" for months there were texts, snapchat, and instagram — she was told she was a loser, she had no friends. She was even told, 'why don't you kill yourself, ' \" the lawyer for the grossmans says, per nbc news. But school administrators \" ignored months of pleas \" from her family to do something, the lawyer says, despite the fact that after the harassment started in october, mallory started getting chronic headaches and stomachaches and her grades went down. Grossman's mother says the family spoke to teachers, guidance counselors, the vice principal, and the principal, and that while she was told the school was investigating, she felt her concerns were dismissed. When nothing changed, she even approached the parent of one of the alleged bullies ( the family has identified three or four students, though not publicly, and their lawyer says they are considering taking action against their families as well ). \" i can confidently say i spoke to one of the parents the night before mallory — before this, \" grossman's mother says. \" and i can tell you that the mother dismissed it, said it was just a big joke, and that i really shouldn't worry about it. \" during the family's press conference monday, their lawyer said a cellphone can be \" a lethal weapon \" in the hands of the wrong child, nj 101.5 reports.",

Critics are in love with richard linklater's everybody wants some!!, giving it a 91 % rating on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: the film follows university baseball jocks for a weekend in 1980. It has \" a swagger that instead of being irritating becomes irresistible, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. \" it ' ll slap on a smile on your face that won't quit. \" blake jenner, wyatt russell, and zoey deutch are all terrific and provide \" raucous \" laughs, he says. \" it's frequently hilarious and unusually gripping for a film that strives to avoid manufactured drama. … it wins you over without ever seeming to try, \" writes david sims at the atlantic. \" in short, it's an effortless cult classic, delivered by a master of the form, and one of the first truly must-see movies of 2016. \" sims particularly likes linklater's \" take on dudehood, \" which avoids \" one-dimensional stereotypes. \" rene rodriguez agrees the flick \" will have a cult following that thrives long after it has fallen out of the weekly top 10 box office race. \" it's \" the rare sort of raunchy american comedy that allows as much time for scenes of people simply talking as it does for mud-wrestling matches and bar brawls, \" rodriguez writes at the miami herald. There's not much of a plot, but \" the mood is loose and easygoing, and the dialogue flows because linklater loves words. \" linklater works \" with the grace of a surreptitious curveball and the ease of a perfect pop song, \" writes stephanie zacharek at time. The result is \" a seemingly straightforward picture that's surprisingly stealthy in capturing the joy and exaltation of being an almost-adult. \" she argues the entire cast of mostly newbie actors is \" winning, \" but jenner and glen powell \" are the real standouts. \" the soundtrack is awesome, to boot.",

Geldof was known for being a bit of a wild child when she was younger, but the ap reports that in 2009 she said her days of taking drugs were behind her. Friends insist to the mirror that she wasn't on drugs before her death, and the paper notes that since becoming a mother, she hasn't been spotted around the \" showbiz scene \" much. The paper, which also reports that police found no evidence of drugs or a suicide note at the home where geldof was found dead, has more details on her past: in 2008, she had to be treated by paramedics for a suspected drug overdose, but last october, she said things really turned around when she married \" the right person \" and had her two young sons. \" it healed many things in me that were painful, \" she said. One of those painful things was the death of her mother, paula yates, from a heroin overdose when geldof was just 11. One of the last photos geldof posted to instagram, the day before she died, was a picture of her and yates with the simple caption, \" me and my mum. \" geldof was \" emotionally scarred \" by her mother's death, nbc news notes, and had often spoken in interviews of the impact it had on her. \" i did experiment with drugs, i did get drunk and go to parties, but i was never that wild, \" she said two years ago. \" i could have been, i could have let myself spiral, but all the time i remembered what happened to my mum. \" the mirror claims that at this point, geldof's death is suspected to be from natural causes. The daily mail, never one to turn down a chance to be sensational, notes that geldof was known for going on juice cleanses, and that two years ago there was some concern that the diets could put her at risk of \" acute cardiac arrest. \" radar notes that in recent weeks, there had been growing concern about how skinny geldof was.",

        "summary": "Conspiracy theories have been building about heartbleed, but the man whose coding error caused the vulnerability says it was an honest mistake. Dr. Robin seggelman, a german programmer, says he was trying to improve openssl with the patch that introduced heartbleed — his other patches to the open-source software project have fixed bugs and added new features. \" it was a simple programming error, \" he tells the sydney morning herald, and a \" quite trivial \" one at that — which happened to have a \" severe \" impact. The openssl consultant who reviewed the patch missed the mistake too — reviewers generally look only at how an algorithm works, not the code itself, one expert explains. Seggelman, 31, is an influential and burgeoning academic who has been working on cybersecurity issues since 2009. He introduced the patch on new year's eve, 2011. \" it's hard to be mad at a guy so devoted to a project that he was doing bug fixes on a holiday, \" writes kashmir hill at forbes. In other heartbleed news: a google security researcher who helped expose the bug is donating the $ 15,000 reward he earned for doing so to a crowdfunding campaign to create encryption tools for journalists to help them avoid the watchful eye of the nsa and us government, the daily dot reports. Neel mehta's contribution pushed the campaign over its $ 100,000 goal. Meanwhile, security experts warn reuters that the heartbleed bug's impact could extend beyond web servers, possibly allowing hackers to crack mobile phones and even security products like firewalls.",

The answer appears to be no. According to nbc news, a cdc report released thursday shows a 17 % increase in hpv-related cancers between 2004 and 2012 to nearly 39,000 per year. Dr. Lois ramondetta, an expert in gynecologic oncology, says it's become an \" epidemic \" especially for men, in whom hpv can cause cancers of the mouth, tongue, and throat. Hpv increases the risk of those cancers by at least seven times, and unlike with hpv-caused cervical cancer in women, there's no screening for them. The cdc report found 93 % of all hpv-related cancers could be prevented with the currently available vaccine. That's approximately 28,500 fewer cases of cancer every year, afp reports. And yet in 2014, only 40 % of teen girls and 22 % of teen boys received the necessary three doses of the vaccine, which works best if administered before teens become sexually active. Paskett calls those numbers \" extremely sad. \" \"we must change the perception of the hpv vaccine from something that prevents a sexually transmitted disease to a vaccine that prevents cancer, \" she tells cbs. ( some british teens invented condoms that change color near hpv and other stds. )",

The rover — photographed by the lander after it separated from the vehicle yesterday — sent back color photos of the lander as the nation's leaders waited in the beijing aerospace control center. The 300-pound rover will soon begin its mission to gather data and scout for mineral resources that could someday be mined. China's leaders — who hailed the successful landing as a \" new glory \" for china and an \" outstanding contribution \" to humanity's peaceful use of space — are already looking ahead to future moon missions, the ap finds. The chang ' e 3 lander's mission will be followed by a chang ' e 4 to do more research and a chang ' e 5 in 2017 to bring back lunar soil and rock samples — and pave the way for sending a chinese astronaut to the moon sometime after 2020.",

In the latest case, the singer is accused of ripping off marvin gaye's \" let's get it on, \" which gaye wrote with edward townsend in 1973, per tmz. Structured asset sales, which claims to have purchased one-third of the rights to the song upon townsend's 2003 death, says the melody, rhythms, harmonies, backing chorus, bass line, drums, looping, tempo, and syncopation of gaye's hit are mirrored in sheeran's \" thinking out loud, \" which won song of the year at the 2016 grammys. The company is seeking $ 100 million. Per tmz, sheeran was also sued this year for copyright infringement relating to a song he wrote for tim mcgraw and faith hill.

Meanwhile the wider clutha region estimates it has upwards of 1,000 job vacancies. \" when i was unemployed and had a family to feed, clutha gave me a chance, and now we want to offer that opportunity to other kiwi families who might be struggling, \" clutha mayor bryan cadogen told the guardian. \" we have got youth unemployment down to two.

If you are a good enough caster, you could biff a line to the river and catch a trout, or biff it that way and catch a blue cod, \" mr dick said. \" that is how close you are to the real new zealand. It's here, \" he said. Photo: rnz/ ian telfer special housing areas in auckland have to include a proportion of so-called affordable housing costing no more than $ 550,000.

They have already sold the three sections - to a man coming back to the town after 25 years away,"

        "summary": "Former new republic literary editor leon wieseltier's comeback has abruptly stalled amid accusations of sleazy behavior. Wieseltier, long prominent in social and literary circles and a new republic editor for three decades, had been installed as editor of idea, a new literary magazine funded by laurene powell jobs, but the publication was axed after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment, the new york times reports. Sources tell the times that more than a dozen former new republic staffers shared stories on an email chain about how wieseltier, 65, had made passes at them, kissed them \" sloppily \" on the mouth, asked about their sex lives, and told them their dresses weren't tight enough. The women were apparently inspired to come forward by harvey weinstein's downfall. Wieseltier apologized tuesday for \" misdeeds \" against female colleagues. \" i am ashamed to know that i made any of them feel demeaned and disrespected, \" he said. The first edition of idea was already completed and was to be released next week. Wieseltier left the new republic in late 2014 after a dispute with then-editor chris hughes. Hughes tells politico that in october that year, he received a complaint about unwanted sexual advances and warned wieseltier that there was a zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment. The atlantic — where wieseltier is a contributing editor — reports that he is among dozens of men named on a spreadsheet entitled \" sh ---- media men \" that has been circulating for at least a week.",

Perhaps even more alarming: 31 % of cropland in the us, 35 % of fresh water, and 30 % of fertilizer went in to producing food that later landed in the trash in 2010, according to a press release.

        "summary": "The texas woman who allegedly put her 2-year-old daughter into a heated oven last week was under the influence of pot, alcohol, and possibly also meth or a synthetic drug ( like k2 or spice ) at the time, police say. Tasha hatcher was arrested after her daughter, who was naked when placed in the oven, suffered second- and third-degree burns on her back, torso, legs, and buttocks. Newly released records obtained by wfaa describe hatcher's erratic behavior after the alleged incident: the neighbor who called authorities said hatcher showed up on his doorstep, naked, with her burned daughter, and made sexual references, masturbated in front of the neighbor, and \" kept singing to god and giving praise to him, \" according to the deputy who responded to the call. Hatcher also allegedly \" performed lewd acts \" and made sexual advances toward the deputy, fox 4 reports. Hatcher also allegedly told her neighbor she'd put the little girl, along with a cat she said she shot, into an oven. ( authorities haven't ever said whether a cat was found. ) hatcher continued \" acting out sexually \" when she was taken to an emergency room for a medical evaluation, authorities say, and the next day, she acted \" incoherent \" when being questioned by a cps worker. She answered one question about her actions the night prior by saying, \" curiosity killed the cat, \" then, when asked what she meant, she replied, \" ask me questions and i will lie to you. \" hatcher had been questioned by cps in 2005 for allegedly allowing her son to get out of her house unsupervised and in 2006 for allegedly leaving him at a 24-hour daycare for more than 31 hours and allegedly being drunk at times when picking him up. In 2008, she allegedly kidnapped her son, who is currently in the care of his father. Hatcher's daughter will go into foster care when she is released from the hospital, the dallas morning news reports.",

But reports out this morning say that la county coroner officials told houston's family that the cause of her death was not drowning, due to the insufficient amount of water found in her lungs.

The sun, meanwhile, reports that houston went on a \" two-night booze binge \" before her death, and claims that she was found with her face underwater in the tub and her legs in the air. The paper also claims half a dozen bottles of prescription drugs were found in the room, including lorazepam, valium, and xanax; it compares them to the drugs taken by michael jackson and notes that they can act as sedatives if mixed with liquor. Houston was also reportedly seen wandering, with wet hair and mismatched clothes, around the hotel lobby and doing handstands by the pool in the days before her death.

And parents who want a good view have to open their wallets, too, reports the bradenton herald. In advance of the may 31 graduation, the school has sold prime seating at the school stadium for $ 200 a row. Each row seats about 15, meaning about $ 13 a person. The school, looking to defray costs of the ceremony, sold out its 10 best rows in four hours. Across the country, meanwhile, another high school is having money problems of another magnitude. Allen high school in texas says it will not be able to use its $ 60 million football stadium because of safety issues, reports the dallas morning news. Yes, that's $ 60 million. The stadium opened in 2012 after voters in the rich dallas suburb approved its funding, notes usa today, but cracks soon started showing up in the concrete. Builders are working on a fix, but the school's powerhouse football team has to play home games in plano in the meantime.",

U.s. Customs and border protection figures show 14,732 pounds of meth seized by the san diego field office during the fiscal year that ended sept. 30, accounting for 63 percent of the synthetic drug seized at all land, air and sea ports of entry nationwide. With the california border as their main smuggling route, \"the mexican cartels are flooding the u.s. Marketplace with their cheap methamphetamine, \" said gary hill, the u.s. Drug enforcement administration's assistant special agent in charge in san diego. Undercover agents are purchasing meth in san diego for $ 3,500 a pound, versus about $ 11,800 for a pound of cocaine, hill said. \"we have seen the trend of the price of meth decreasing tremendously since 2008. \" methamphetamine, a highly addictive synthetic drug, once was primarily produced in the united states, and san diego was infamous as its manufacturing capital. But with a u.s. Law enforcement crackdown on the precursor chemicals used to make meth, the drug is now largely produced in mexico. The dea estimates that 90 percent of the meth consumed in the united states is manufactured in labs south of the border. Mexican cartels are finding it far less expensive to produce meth in mexico than importing cocaine from south america, hill said. \"the overhead is tremendous for cocaine, \" while for meth, \"the overhead is minimal.

U.s. Customs and border protection figures show 14,732 pounds of meth seized by the san diego field office during the fiscal year that ended sept. 30, accounting for 63 percent of the synthetic drug seized at all land, air and sea ports of entry nationwide. With the california border as their main smuggling route, \"the mexican cartels are flooding the u.s. Marketplace with their cheap methamphetamine, \" said gary hill, the u.s. Drug enforcement administration's assistant special agent in charge in san diego. Undercover agents are purchasing meth in san diego for $ 3,500 a pound, versus about $ 11,800 for a pound of cocaine, hill said. \"we have seen the trend of the price of meth decreasing tremendously since 2008. \" methamphetamine, a highly addictive synthetic drug, once was primarily produced in the united states, and san diego was infamous as its manufacturing capital. But with a u.s. Law enforcement crackdown on the precursor chemicals used to make meth, the drug is now largely produced in mexico. The dea estimates that 90 percent of the meth consumed in the united states is manufactured in labs south of the border. Mexican cartels are finding it far less expensive to produce meth in mexico than importing cocaine from south america, hill said. \"the overhead is tremendous for cocaine, \" while for meth, \"the overhead is minimal. They oversee the manufacturing. There is no middleman. \" wrapped packages of methamphetamine first detected by a canine screening team were discovered in the rocker panels of a 2008 chrysler sebring that crossed at the calexico downtown port of entry on april 17. — cbp share photo",
            "The ingredients for methamphetamine seized by the drug enforcement administration … ( drug enforcement administration … ) to the dismay of san diego county officials, methamphetamine is making a comeback among local drug users eager for a quick high and drug sellers looking for big profits. In the mid-1980s, the county earned the unofficial title of the nation's meth capital. In 1985, an official with the drug enforcement administration told the associated press that san diego \"is to crystal meth what bogota, colombia, is to cocaine -- the capital, the center. \" several reasons were suggested: proximity to mexico, presence of biker gangs, and sprawling rural areas where meth labs could operate undetected. The numbers fluctuated year to year but by late in the last decade, officials were cautiously optimistic that the meth wave was being reversed, through education, vigorous enforcement and additional treatment programs for addicts."

Some highlights from the report, which can be seen in full here: a laptop used to archive clinton's emails disappeared after it was put in the mail. A person interviewed by the fbi said he had deleted the emails from the missing laptop but failed to wipe the hard drive, bloomberg reports. Clinton aides huma abedin and monica hanley told investigators that clintons old devices would end up in parts \" unknown once she transitioned to a new device, \" politico notes. But bill clinton aide justin cooper, who helped set up the private email server, \" did recall two instances where he destroyed clinton's old mobile devices by breaking them in half or hitting them with a hammer. \" the fbi identified a total of 13 devices that clinton used to send email and has only been able to find three of them. Clinton told the fbi that she wasn't sure what the ' ( c ) ' portion markings used to indicate confidential information meant, but thought it had something to do with alphabetization. She said she relied on staff to judge what was classified and \" could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address, \" the new york times notes.

Business insider reports that snap chief evan spiegel is being sued by anthony pompliano, who worked for the company for just a few weeks in 2015, with pompliano alleging the company tweaked data and misled advertisers, per bgr india. But it's pompliano's recollection of a meeting between himself and spiegel in september of that year to discuss growth in untapped markets that's making waves, with pompliano claiming his boss scoffed at the idea of the snapchat app proliferating in less privileged nations. \" this app is only for rich people, \" spiegel said, per the suit's transcript, which appears in full on bgr. \" i don't want to expand into poor countries like india and spain. \" spiegel's alleged comments have caused what the guardian deems a \" public relations crisis \" in india, with the hashtags #boycottsnapchat and #uninstallsnapchat leaping to the front of twitter trends over the weekend. Ratings in apple and google's app stores have also plummeted, with a slew of new one-star reviews. \" don't mess with india, \" one commenter posted on twitter in a message to spiegel and snapchat. A snapchat spokesperson, however, calls the claims \" ridiculous \" and says they were lobbed against spiegel by a \" disgruntled former employee, \" per business insider. \" obviously, snapchat is for everyone! it's available worldwide to download for free, \" the rep adds.

According to the bbc, a 124-mile-long crack on the larsen c ice shelf grew more than 10 miles over just six days to end the month of may. The crack, which had been running parallel to the edge of the ice shelf, also took a right turn toward the shelf's edge, cnn reports. The crack is now only eight miles from the edge of the shelf, and it appears there's nothing left stopping a major chunk of the shelf from calving free. When the iceberg does split off, it will take 10 % of the larsen c ice shelf with it. The iceberg will be more than 1,900 square miles in size and 1,150 feet thick, gizmodo reports. The loss will make larsen c less stable, and one researcher says the entire shelf could fall apart \" in a day or two. \" the larsen a and larsen b ice shelves already broke up after similar events in past years. The loss of the ice shelf can increase the speed of glaciers flowing from the land to the ocean and therefore the speed of rising sea levels.

The german business daily \" handelsblatt \" said the error was pointed out by the german central bank, the bundesbank.

Kfw said it immediately detected and rectified the error and recalled the money without suffering any financial damage. Kfw said an experienced programmer made an input error that caused its software to automatically make multiple payments to the four banks. The development bank said it \" launched a comprehensive international and external investigation \" so that it can avoid a repeat of the error. History repeating? the mistake isn't the first time kfw has had to go scurrying after erroneously transferred money. In 2008, during the financial crisis, the bank transferred 320 million euros to lehman brothers on the day the us investment bank filed for bankruptcy. It was derided as \" germany's dumbest bank \" by the mass-market daily \" bild, \" and the error became a political scandal. Kfw is not alone though in what the industry often calls \" fat finger \" incidents. In 2015, deutsche bank managed to make an erroneous payment of nearly six billion dollars to a hedge fund. The money was returned the next day. On its website, kfw said it's the world's safest bank, citing an award by the magazine \" global finance. \" mm/sms ( dpa, handelsblatt, bloomberg )"

But when the 37-year-old lawyer began having \" the most excruciating pain \" that felt like \" a steel pole through my chest \" while driving home from work in missouri on july 26, he decided to ask his tesla model x to drive him to the hospital, rather than pull over and wait for an ambulance, he tells ky3 and slate. The car — his for only a week — not only found a hospital 20 miles away but drove him most of the distance using its autopilot feature before neally manually steered into a parking lot and checked himself in. Doctors say he suffered a pulmonary embolism, a blocked blood vessel in the lungs, and is lucky to be alive, though he was able to return home to branson that night. Neally says he remembers little of the drive and wonders if he might've been in an accident without the autopilot feature, which is able to brake, accelerate, and steer without input from the driver. The feature is controversial, given a man's recent death while using it in florida. But \" i ' m very thankful i had it for this experience, \" says neally. \" there's no technology that's perfect, but i think the measure is that it's better and safer, \" he adds. \" if something like that happens where i become unconscious or incapacitated while i ' m driving, i ' m not going to cross over the interstate and slam into somebody. \" last month, tesla ceo elon musk said the autopilot feature could've saved 500,000 lives last year if it was universally available, per electrek, though several autopilot crashes have been reported.

St. Clair was the husband of tressia st. Clair, davis ' mother. Mcloud police and pottawatomie county deputies were called about 10: 10 p.m. Dec. 21 to 4 shadow lake. Davis said he and st. Clair fought, and he thought st. Clair was dead, according to a probable cause affidavit. When authorities questioned davis, he said st. Clair asked him to come over for drinks. The men began arguing and davis told officers that st. Clair \"came at him, \" and they began exchanging blows. Davis told investigators that he hit st. Clair's head, causing him to lose consciousness. Then, davis said, he grabbed his stepfather's underwear and gave him an \"atomic wedgie \" by pulling the underwear over his stepfather's head. \"i'd never seen this before, but when we first looked at our victim seeing the waistband of his underwear was around his neck, \" pottawatomie county sheriff mike booth said. The cause of death has been determined to be from blunt force trauma to the head and asphyxiation. The death has been ruled a homicide, said amy elliott, oklahoma state medical examiner's spokeswoman. While he was at st. Clair's home, davis sent a friend a text message saying he was planning to harm denver, according to the affidavit. According to court documents, tressia st. Clair, who was in the hospital during the confrontation, told investigators that davis lived in a trailer house at 3 shadow lake drive owned by tressia and denver st. Clair. She told investigators that denver st. Clair thought davis owed him $ 7,000 for living in the trailer home. Brad davis ' brother told investigators that on dec. 20, denver st. Clair said \"he was going to pull brad out of that trailer by his throat. \" st. Clair was under a permanent protective order filed in 2008 by his wife, tressia ann st. Clair. She lived in the home where denver st. Clair was killed. In the 2008 protective order, tressia st. Clair claimed she found her husband embraced in a \"sexual way, \" with a drinking buddy and that he later grabbed her by the neck"

A source has revealed to bloomberg that the special counsel subpoenaed deutsche bank a few weeks ago for records on the institution's business dealings with trump and his family, and the guardian reports those records have now been turned over to mueller's team. Deutsche bank, which has refused to volunteer information to democratic lawmakers on the $ 300 million or so trump was loaned years ago for real estate deals, is staying relatively tight-lipped on the mueller request, simply telling bloomberg in a statement: \" deutsche bank always cooperates with investigating authorities in all countries. \" per reuters, the source says the mueller inquiry focused on \" certain money and credit transactions. \" in july 2016, bloomberg scrutinized trump's relationship with deutsche bank and found it covered a span of 20 years, with the $ 300 million equaling about half of his outstanding debt. The guardian notes it's not clear whether mueller is going after the data to see if it's somehow tied to russia or if there's another reason he's looking into it. The paper reported earlier this year that deutsche had undertaken its own investigation to see if trump's loans had russian guarantees buried within them ( it says it found no evidence of that ).

In a new study, harvard scientists analyzed data on more than 4,000 students in that age range collected via the national health and nutrition examination survey — among many other things, it includes urine tests that reveal hydration. The researchers found that 54.5 % of those kids were \" inadequately \" hydrated, with boys being more at risk than girls. As lead researcher erica kenney notes to npr, \" this doesn't mean we're saying kids are dropping like flies or...

Kenney sees an obstacle in getting kids to drink more: our dated schools, which are sometimes worried about older plumbing and lead.

Now, neil degrasse tyson leads us on a tour of the universe — with some help from seth macfarlane — and critics are generally impressed: \" the new cosmos might be called the large hadron collider of pop science: expensive, splashy, and ambitious, \" writes dennis overbye in the times. \" we all need a unifying dose of curiosity and wonder, \" and \" it's hard to imagine a better man to reboot the cosmos than neil degrasse tyson, \" who adds \" a little shtick and a wink to let the audience in on the fun. \" \" as a cosmic tour guide, tyson is easily sagan's equal, \" writes verne gay in newsday. The show features \" quantum leaps in special effects technology that transport sagan's original vision to places even he could never have dreamed of. \" but \" commercial tv doesn't have the luxury of time, so there's a rushed, breathless quality to this finished product. \" at vulture, matt zoller seitz sees a fundamental difference between the original and the remake. Sagan, despite being agnostic, \" convinced many people of faith that he was, if not an ally, then at least not an adversary. \" whereas tyson's version \" feels like a pushback against faith's encroachments on the intellectual terrain of science. \" it depicts \" organized religion as an irrelevant and intellectually discredited means of understanding factual reality. \" in the chicago sun-times, lori rackl offers a very different take, writing that she \" almost fell asleep … watching the premiere. \" its \" use of animation makes it feel even more like something you'd see in a high school science class.

The us dietary guidelines note people should eat a variety of fruits and vegetables to help \" achieve and maintain a healthy weight, \" but lead author dr. Monica bertoia wanted to discover how the foods relate to weight and which ones are best for your waistline. Researchers started by recording the diets of 133,468 people in their 30s and 40s, then asked participants, who self-reported their weight, to complete a food frequency questionnaire every four years from 1986 to 2010, reports medical news today. With adjustments for lifestyle variables and other aspects of their diets, researchers found people who ate an extra serving of fruit a day gained 0.53 pounds less than others, while those who consumed an extra serving of vegetables gained 0.25 pounds less. Those who ate high-fiber, low-glycemic vegetables gained less weight than those consumed other veggies, but cauliflower was best — excluding \" tofu/soy \" which had a 2.47-pound lower weight gain — with a 1.4-pound lower gain. Fruit-eaters who munched on citrus fruits, grapes, and prunes fared well, but berries, apples, and pears led to the least gains with 1.11 to 1.24 pounds less than others, reports the new york times. Which foods caused people to gain weight? starchy, lower-fiber, higher-glycemic vegetables like potatoes, peas, and corn — though they were beneficial in terms of nutrients like potassium, vitamin c, vitamin b6, iron, fiber, and protein.

Rubio was spotted during a campaign stop in new hampshire on monday sporting slick, heeled boots that have caught the attention of everyone from carly fiorina to new york magazine, which compares rubio's fashion taste to that of one direction heartthrob harry styles. While serving to add a couple of inches to rubio's 5-foot-10-inch frame, the boots have resulted in more than a few laughs. \" this is straight out of an austin powers movie, \" msnbc host joe scarborough said on morning joe, per the guardian. \" they're shagalicious! \" notes new york: \" conveniently, that style is called a cuban heel, because marco rubio is on-brand from head to toe. \" vanity fair suggested rubio might be wearing a $ 1,990 pair of tom ford boots, but rubio's camp tells politico they were purchased from florsheim; this $ 135 pair looks awfully similar, per the new york times. That's not to say rubio isn't splurging elsewhere. Despite his campaign manager boasting that rubio \" flies 95 % commercial, always coach \" back in september, politico reports the candidate has been flying on private jets almost exclusively for the past two months at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars per day. He plans to keep up the expense through the primaries. At an event in iowa on tuesday, rubio said simply, \" we want to get everywhere. \" ( donald trump thinks he's more attractive than marco. )",

Though it was the free rent that swayed the owners ( who now need to find a home themselves ), the pizza didn't hurt, and 23-year-old johnny barrett got a house denicola describes as having a \" beautiful feeling. \" \" i thought it was hilarious, \" owner holly marsh, who plans to find a place outside the city limits with her husband and two young children, tells abc news. \" i ' m a fan of unorthodox approaches to things, and that definitely stood out and got our attention. \" since an average pie at denicola's, which was established in 1978, costs around $ 20, one pie a month for the next 40 years will total nearly $ 10,000 — or more. Denicola tells koin 6 the family can top the pie with \" whatever they want, it doesn't even matter. \" ( on the flip side, check out what some sellers have been willing to add into the mix. )",

Sugary drinks may have contributed to 180,000 deaths around the globe in 2010, but excessive salt consumption caused 2.3 million deaths that year, according to a new study by the american heart association. Some key numbers presented at an aha meeting yesterday, per bloomberg and abc news: excess salt caused 15 % of all heart-related deaths. 40 % of the deaths were premature, meaning they occurred in people aged 69 or younger. The problem starts early: researchers found that even food meant for toddlers contains too much sodium. Most of the deaths were in lower-income countries, with the us ranking 19th of the 30 biggest nations studied. Researchers say one in 10 deaths in america can be blamed on excess sodium. The aha recommends limiting sodium intake to 1,500 milligrams or less per day, but 75 % of the global population eats nearly twice that. The average global sodium intake in 2010 was almost 4,000 milligrams a day. The us isn't much better off: average intake here was 3,600 milligrams per day.",

        "summary": "A stanford university professor is proposing what usa today calls a \" groundbreaking \" anti-hurricane plan: we could use offshore wind turbines to reduce the storms ' power — even a storm like katrina. For that, we'd need a lot of them, though, according to mark jacobson: something along the lines of 78,000 of them over 13,500 square miles of ocean outside new orleans. That's an area 2.5 times as big as connecticut, scientific american reports. But according to computer modeling, it would have reduced katrina's storm surge up to 79 % and shaved some 80mph off its wind speeds at landfall — which were 118mph. The upside: it wouldn't cost anything, at least not over time. The installation would require billions of dollars, but the system would eventually pay for itself thanks to the electricity it would sell — unlike, say, $ 20 billion in seawalls proposed in new york after hurricane sandy. Scientific american notes that jacobson painstakingly addresses all kinds of possible objections to his plan, including concerns that the storm could knock over the turbines ( he explains why they'd stay standing ) and fears for the lives of birds ( more are killed by fossil-fuel plants, he says ). The us currently has no offshore wind farms, but 11 are in the development stage, usa today reports. Jacobson, scientific american adds, is becoming something of a celebrity scientist due to his idea: he was on letterman in october.",

            "Hurricanes are unstoppable, right? apparently not. An intriguing new computer simulation shows that 78,000 large wind turbines spread across 35,000 square kilometers of ocean outside of new orleans would have cut hurricane katrina's category 3 winds at landfall by 129 to 158 kilometers per hour ( 80 to 98 miles per hour ) and reduced the storm surge by 79 percent. The same collection of turbines offshore of new york city would have dropped hurricane sandy's winds by 125 to 140 kph and the surge by up to 34 percent. That sounds impressive. But wait … 78,000 turbines? each one 100 meters high with a blade span 127 meters in diameter spaced about 650 meters apart and spanning a region of ocean 2.5 times the size of connecticut? the idea sounds crazy, except for the bottom line: \"the cost would be zero, \" says mark jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at stanford university. \"the turbines pay for themselves through the revenue from generating electricity. The storm surge and wind protection are free — a bonus. \" actually the cost to erect such a massive wind farm, or set of farms, would be many billions of dollars. But jacobson says the cost would be recouped over time through electricity sales, replacing many coal-fired or nuclear power plants. And then there is the alternative, he notes: \"new york is considering building $ 20 billion in seawalls \" to prevent future storm surge damage after hurricane sandy caused more than $ 60 billion in losses in new york and new jersey. \"seawalls don't pay for themselves, \" jacobson says. \"turbines do. \" jacobson has calculated in mind-bending detail how turbines could defuse hurricane forces, all laid out in a new paper appearing today in nature climate change.

The movies in question are those filmed in the \" scope \" format, flavorwire notes. Normal widescreen has an aspect ratio of 1.85: 1, while scope offers 2.39: 1. That means, without cropping, even a widescreen tv would show black bars at the top and bottom of the picture.

        "summary": "The inner details of a march 8, 1971, hit on the fbi office in media, pa., are finally coming to light — from the mouths of those who wielded the crowbars. An eight-person antiwar group ( made up in part of professors, a day-care director, and a 20-year-old self-taught lock picker ) descended on the office while the rest of the country watched muhammad ali and joe frazier go 15 rounds, reports the philadelphia inquirer. The new york times reports they spent months casing the building, with one member posing as a college student inquiring about job options to gain access and determine there was no alarm system. They picked a lock, used a crowbar to break another, stuffed suitcases with as many as 1,000 documents, and fled in getaway cars, later meeting at a farmhouse to review their haul — which included files they mailed to reporters, files that shook the fbi \" to its core, \" per the inquirer. One memo advised agents to question activists in \" new left \" groups on campuses to \" get the point across there is an fbi agent behind every mailbox \"; another urged the infiltration of african-american groups. But the break-in most notably led to the first publicized reference to cointelpro, a surveillance program started under j. Edgar hoover in 1956 with the goal of ruining the lives of perceived enemies — like martin luther king, jr., who was sent an anonymous letter written by fbi agents that told him to kill himself or see his affairs publicized. ( it also targeted perceived communists and the kkk before being shuttered in 1972 after the break-in threw light on it, reports nbc news. ) \" the fbi was never the same, \" says betty medsger, a reporter who received some documents and has a book coming out on the subject this week. With the statute of limitations having expired decades ago, five members of the group decided to speak at her urging. A wild side note: about 200 fbi agents investigated the crime for more than five years, and closed the case with no answers; medsger says only one of the eight made it onto the final suspects lists.",

            "Philadelphia — the perfect crime is far easier to pull off when nobody is watching. So on a night nearly 43 years ago, while muhammad ali and joe frazier bludgeoned each other over 15 rounds in a televised title bout viewed by millions around the world, burglars took a lock pick and a crowbar and broke into a federal bureau of investigation office in a suburb of philadelphia, making off with nearly every document inside. They were never caught, and the stolen documents that they mailed anonymously to newspaper reporters were the first trickle of what would become a flood of revelations about extensive spying and dirty-tricks operations by the f.b.i. Against dissident groups. The burglary in media, pa., on march 8, 1971, is a historical echo today, as disclosures by the former national security agency contractor edward j. Snowden have cast another unflattering light on government spying and opened a national debate about the proper limits of government surveillance.

So on a night nearly 43 years ago, while muhammad ali and joe frazier bludgeoned each other over 15 rounds in a televised title bout viewed by millions around the world, burglars took a lock pick and a crowbar and broke into a federal bureau of investigation office in a suburb of philadelphia, making off with nearly every document inside.

Against dissident groups. The burglary in media, pa., on march 8, 1971, is a historical echo today, as disclosures by the former national security agency contractor edward j. Snowden have cast another unflattering light on government spying and opened a national debate about the proper limits of government surveillance. The burglars had, until now, maintained a vow of silence about their roles",

        "summary": "Up to 30 haitian migrants died yesterday in a doomed attempt to get out of their desperately poor homeland. Coast guard officials say a \" grossly overloaded, unbalanced, unseaworthy \" sailboat carrying around 150 migrants hit a reef and capsized near staniel cay in the bahamas, the ap reports. The bahamas military and us coast guard found scores of survivors clinging to the hull. Some 20 bodies were recovered and the survivors — weak and dehydrated after up to nine days at sea with little food and water — were taken to a military base where they will be processed then sent back to haiti. It's not clear where the migrants ' final destination was, but the route has long been used by smugglers trying to get people into the us. Immigrant smuggling from haiti has soared over the last few years, and authorities believe hundreds drown every year — sometimes when they are forced out of boats dozens of yards from rocky shores and told to swim for it. \" these smugglers are opportunists, they don't care about anything, they don't care about you, they are about making money by any means necessary, \" the chief of the haitian women of miami political activist group tells nbc. \" they are preying on desperate people who would risk anything, anything, in search of a better life somewhere else. \"",

He has \" accepted \" his sentence and says that his home life, which he and erik said was filled with sexual abuse at the hands of their dad and silence from their mom, \" prepared me surprisingly well for the chaos of prison life. \" both brothers have married while in prison ( lyle is actually on his second wife ), and he says he enjoys a \" really strong \" bond with erik that they keep going with letters. \" it's so painful and complicated and confusing, \" he says of the shared experience and \" secrets \" that have kept them close. \" the bond [ becomes ] very great and intense. \" e! online got abc news correspondent terry moran, who had covered the brothers'trial, to spill on how the network got lyle to finally break his silence, with moran revealing lyle was always \" a little more forward...
