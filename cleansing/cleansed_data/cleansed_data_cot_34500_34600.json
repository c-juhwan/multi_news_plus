        "summary": "Anthony weiner could face child pornography charges — and a minimum 15 years in prison, according to a report in the wall street journal. The hill reports the 51-year-old weiner allegedly sent a 15-year-old girl shirtless photos of himself, descriptions of sexual acts he wanted to perform with her, and more. Now sources say federal prosecutors are mulling whether or not to bring child pornography charges against weiner, with his lawyers — obviously — trying to convince them not to. The most serious charge weiner could face is production of child pornography for allegedly convincing the girl to send him sexually explicit photos. That charge comes with a 15-year mandatory minimum prison sentence. He could also be charged with receipt of child pornography ( a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence ) or possession of child pornography. Weiner resigned from congress in 2011 after a sexting scandal, the new york daily news reports. Two years later, he was embroiled in another sexting scandal while running for mayor of new york city.",

The satellites, he said, could help us predict earthquakes, which was ever more important, \" after what happened in japan. \" obama, he continued, is \" destroying what makes the human species unique from all other forms of life, \" and \" condemning the human species \" by failing to adequately prepare california, and the united states, for a large earthquake.

It's one of the largest food recalls in recent memory, affecting well over 400 products from crf frozen foods in pasco, wash., sold under more than 40 different brand names in all 50 states, canada, and mexico, per the ap. So far, eight people have been sickened by listeria that's genetically similar to that found in crf vegetables, including six in california, and two have died in maryland and washington, though listeria was not the primary cause of death. The initial recall started april 22, covering 11 frozen vegetable products. On may 2, crf expanded it to include all frozen organic and traditional fruit and vegetable products out of its washington plant since may 1, 2014. The crf plant closed two weeks ago and the company is still trying to pinpoint the source of the contamination, a rep says. A cdc rep says consumers should check the online recall lists and discard the affected products from their freezers. Products were both packaged for sale as individual products and repackaged by places like piggly wiggly, kroger, and conagra foods as ingredients in a host of other store-brand and private-label products for stores like trader joe's and costco. Also, retailers including target and regional distributors such as hy-vee foods have recently recalled products made by tokyo-based ajinomoto windsor due to the company recalling 70 of its asian variety products that contain crf vegetables — about 47 million pounds worth — some of which were also sold in canada and mexico.",

Police recovered the stolen items. They say vickers took the stereo on aug. 21, before luca went to the hospital, and pawned it for $ 30, and that he took the laptop and charger when luca's mom was at the hospital with the toddler and pawned them for $ 60. Vickers was charged with crimes related to the alleged thefts on aug. 30. After an investigation in which they found vickers had allegedly physically abused luca on several occasions before his death, police arrested him thursday and charged him with second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse. He'd been watching luca and his 3-year-old sister on the day luca was fatally injured, and he told police luca had been knocked down the stairs by an older sibling, abc action news reports. Vickers had just been released from prison in may after serving nearly three years for trafficking in stolen property and defrauding a pawnbroker.",

The losing side does not have an option to appeal. \" that is it. That's a final and binding result, \" a former assistant executive director of the nfl players association tells bloomberg. Today's ruling, which the chicago tribune notes was a unanimous decision from the five-member board, says unionization could throw off the \" competitive balance \" between teams by setting different standards for practice, pay, and other conditions at union and non-union schools. Northwestern had appealed last year's ruling by a regional nlrb director in chicago that led to a vote by football players on whether they wanted to form a union. Those ballots were sealed during the appeal and will now be destroyed. The school has said that its main commitment to student-athletes is to their education, not their athletic endeavors, and that collective bargaining isn't the way to go when addressing concerns of its football players, the tribune notes. Advocates say unionization would help athletes protect their health and financial interests: the college athletes players association, the group that sought to unionize, was seeking increased scholarships, a fund to help ex-players complete their degrees, and ensured coverage for medical expenses related to sports activities, among others, bloomberg reports.",

The unanimous decision by the five-member board puts an end to a nearly two-year saga that led to the first-ever union election by college football players. The case also started a national conversation about college athletes, their roles within school athletic systems and the conditions under which they play and study, a discussion that has resulted in some policy changes benefiting athletes. Despite the dismissed petition, the board did not rule on whether the football players are employees of the university under federal labor law, leaving the door open for the union to try again, which it has vowed to do. William gould iv, a former nlrb chairman, said he wasn't surprised that the nlrb avoided a decision on whether football players are employees, given congress ' hostility toward the board.

Due to the response my eulogy for max received, and because several people have asked for copies, i post the text here. Thank you, again, all of you, for your love and your support. Max's death has shone a light on the innate goodness in people, a quality that i am sure i didn't appreciate until now. I think of that as a gift from our son. I have to say, max, that on the whole, i would have preferred a dozen golf balls. Eight years ago, meg and i stood here and talked about max, who on that day became a bar mitzvah, the jewish threshold of adulthood. Today we are here again to talk about max, who we presumed drowned on feb. 22, shortly after he turned 21, the legal threshold of adulthood. Max always hated being the center of attention. One of the smiles we have allowed ourselves of late is thinking of how max would have felt about trending on twitter, or being the subject of a story on people magazine's website."

        "summary": "Divine intervention — and the bernie sanders paraphernalia decorating her car — made a south carolina tow truck driver decide to leave a woman stranded on the side of the road in asheville, nc, wlos reports. Cassy mcwade says her regular mechanic couldn't come tow her after a car accident monday, so he called ken shupe of shupee max towing in travelers rest for her. Shupe showed up about an hour later and started setting up the car for the tow when he noticed her sanders bumper sticker and sign in the rear window. Shupe tells fox carolina that he told the 25-year-old \" very politely \" that he couldn't tow her because she was \" obviously a socialist, \" telling her to \" call the government \" instead. Shupe, a conservative christian and donald trump supporter, notes he's had a couple of dust-ups with sanders supporters not paying and so now tells wlos he's \" really not interested in doing business with that clientele. \" \" every time i deal with these people i get ' berned ' with an ' e, ' not a ' u, ' \" he adds to fox. Mcwade is legally disabled due to a variety of conditions, including a chronic form of arthritis, fibromyalgia, and early-stage crohn's disease, and she says her own mechanic told shupe she was disabled. Shupe contends he didn't know she was disabled and would have waited with her for the other tow if he had known, though he still wouldn't have towed her. \" something came over me, i think the lord came to me, and he just said get in the truck and leave, \" he says. \" i was so proud, because i felt like i finally drew a line in the sand and stood up for what i believed. \" what mcwade's mother, kelle mcwade believes, per a facebook post cited on fox: \" spread this bigot's story far &amp; wide. … the only difference is that [ trump ] would have taken the money, because he at least realizes that liberals ' money spends just the same as anyone else's. \" ( an artist who painted a nude trump says she was attacked. )",

Diaz's instrument: his dolartoday.com website, which venezuela insists posts fake black-market exchange rates to manipulate the country's currency. The site has already courted two failed lawsuits by venezuela's central bank, and the government has also unleashed hackers on it. \" dolartoday is the empire's strategy to push down the currency and overthrow maduro. Dolartoday is the enemy of the people, \" vp aristobulo isturiz said in early 2016 ( the journal notes \" empire \" refers to the us ). Not that diaz is simply a bored alabama guy with a penchant for numbers: he's actually a retired venezuelan army colonel who assisted in a two-day 2002 coup against then president hugo chavez. Diaz is also now a us citizen after seeking asylum in 2005 in alabama, where his siblings lived. He runs his site — which mixes daily exchange rates with unflattering news about the government, with rates calculated by scanning social media for transaction requests, then comparing that average rate with that seen in underground venezuelan exchange institutions — with two other venezuelan expats. \" it's ironic that with dolartoday in alabama, i do more damage to the government than i did as a military man in venezuela, \" he notes.

        "summary": "In oregon recently, a business was found to have violated the civil rights of a gay couple by refusing to sell them a wedding cake. And last month, everyone was up in arms over an arizona bill that would have made such a thing legal in that state. In light of all the talk on the subject of religious business owners or employees being forced to provide goods or services at gay weddings, despite their objections to homosexuality, david benkof has some ideas. In a daily caller article headlined, \" how to avoid baking a gay wedding cake and get away with it, \" benkof suggests: a religious baker should write something like, \" marriage = one man, one woman \" in icing on the wedding cake. While shooting wedding pictures, a religious photographer should wear a large button with the bible verse that prohibits homosexuality. A religious caterer should make sure to tell all the guests, \" this is not a real wedding. \" a religious band should change the lyrics to songs it performs, so \" i ' m coming out \" becomes \" please go back in. \" \" if same-sex couples learn more traditionally-minded contractors are prepared to do just that if compelled to work the event, their gay bookings will dry up quickly — which is precisely the point. Gay couples who don't want their weddings ruined will have to find a vendor who doesn't object to same-sex marriage. \" in a response on jezebel, erin gloria ryan suggests gays and allies try a similar tactic for dealing with bigots: \" refrain from being friends with these people, or even socially interacting with them at all. Shun ' em. \" and if forced to interact with one because, say, they are a family member, try something like handwriting, \" even though we strongly disagree about homosexuality \" on any holiday cards you might have to give them.

        "summary": "The planet we're living on is about 60 million years older than previously thought. So say scientists in france who studied quartz from australia and south africa that dates back about 3 billion years, reports phys.org. The ratio of gases in the quartz compared to today's ratios suggest both the earth and the moon were created about 40 million years after the formation of the solar system, rather than the previous estimate of 100 million years afterward. That's likely when a collision happened that left behind earth as we know it — and formed the moon, the huffington post explains. At that time, experts think, an object the size of mars smashed into the predecessor of our planet, the los angeles times reports. That collision created earth's atmosphere, while the resulting debris formed the moon. \" the gas sealed in these quartz samples has been handed down to us in a sort of'time capsule, ' \" says a scientist from the university of lorraine. \" we are using standard methods to compute the age of the earth, but having access to these ancient samples gives us new data. \" ( scientists recently found evidence in lunar rocks of that long-ago collision. )",

Fletcher takes readers through the making of collapse into now, the band's fifteenth and final album. Rem first started discussing splitting up in 2008, during the band's last tour, but the members always knew they would make one last record.

Franks later clarified: he intended to make the point that rape rarely causes the pregnancies that result in the later-term abortions he wants to ban, and the issue is therefore irrelevant to his bill. However you parse it, both dave weigel at slate and jonathan chait at new york say franks is no todd akin. Unlike akin, franks \" didn't say it's hard to get pregnant when you're raped, \" writes chait. \" he said rape-induced pregnancy doesn't happen very often, \" and that's a big difference. Given that 30,000 such pregnancies occur each year, plenty of people might disagree with franks'statement.

Richard din, 25, died in the hospital where he worked just 17 hours after coming down with a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterium neisseria meningitidis, reports the san francisco chronicle. His friends and colleagues are receiving preventive antibiotics, as are dozens of health workers amid concerns of a safety breakdown. Din had been handling the bacterium for months before his death, and colleagues describe him as a smart, fastidious researcher who paid attention to safety precautions.

( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — president donald trump's oldest son on monday released a series of private twitter exchanges between himself and wikileaks during and after the 2016 election, including pleas from the website to publicize its leaks. Donald trump jr.'s release of the messages on twitter cames hours after the atlantic first reported them. In the exchanges — some of them around the time that the website was releasing the stolen emails from democrat hillary clinton's campaign chairman — wikileaks praises his father's positive comments about wikileaks and asks trump jr. To release his father's tax returns to the site. The revelations are sure to increase calls in congress to have trump jr. Testify publicly as part of several committee probes into russian interference in the 2016 election. And they add a new element to the investigations that have been probing for months whether trump's campaign colluded in any way with the russian government.

Among the coverage: the coca-cola company's website has a detailed explainer of how backer dreamed up the ad while stuck overnight in shannon, ireland, and the challenges of the commercial shoots. The daily beast reports the commercial's $ 250,000 price tag made it the most expensive to have been filmed at the time. The new york times runs down some of backer's other famous lines, for miller lite, campbell's soup, and oreo. He also now-memorably inserted dave thomas into wendy's commercials, notes ad age. As for what he thought of mad men, backer told the wall street journal in 2015 that he stopped watching after two years as it \" became more of a soap opera. \" he also addresses whether he \" bed a different girl every night \" like don draper. A great quote in ad age from a former colleague: \" i was always envious of bill because he had a grand piano in his new york office. \" virginia's fauquier now reports that backer became a conservationist in his later years and played a primary role in fighting disney's plans to erect a history theme park near the tiny town of haymarket.

Xi and his six fellow leaders were the focus of a transitional ceremony today. \" we shall do everything we can to live up to your trust and fulfill our mission, \" xi said, noting \" many pressing problems within the party that need to be resolved, particularly corruption. \" the country's \" princelings, \" who see themselves, by way of their parents, as heirs to the country's 1949 revolution, have now completed their rise to power, the new york times reports.

But the leadership's makeup demonstrates the continuing sway of former leader jiang zemin; while several of the men are jiang allies, none of hu's three allies are on the committee.

The invasive plant sends out roots in the spring that deprive nearby plants of water, then dries out in the summer as it transforms into extremely effective tinder for wildfires to then kill competing nearby native plants, not to mention the habitat for hundreds of species of wildlife.

Cheatgrass, bromus tectorum, is native to north africa, southwestern asia and europe, but has been introduced and solidly established in north america. It was introduced an unknown number of times with ship ballast and as a contaminant in shipments of seed, and was intentionally introduced for an experiment in pullman, wash., in 1898. We know that it was established in pennsylvania and new york as early as 1860. It swept through the great basin and portions of the columbia river basin like wildfire, essentially establishing its present distribution in the early 1900s with extensive populations in oregon, idaho, washington, nevada, utah and the eastern edge of california. Cheatgrass has largely decimated the unique plant communities in the great basin, which were known for a variety of perennial bunchgrasses. These communities were quite different from the grassland communities of the great plains, which were composed primarily of perennial grasses whose large, intertwined root and rhizome systems formed a matrix so thick that early settlers used it to build sod houses. Advertisement in contrast, the bunchgrasses of the great basin grew literally as clumps of grass, often with bare dirt between them. Sadly, the bunchgrasses have been largely displaced by cheatgrass, which can form monocultures like the one in the accompanying photograph. A series of characteristics make cheatgrass a superior competitor: remarkable ability to change the timing of the life cycle, production of numerous seeds, extremely dense populations and its propensity to support fires. On any site, cheatgrass can germinate in the fall to grow as a winter annual, germinate in the spring with the bunchgrasses, or skip years altogether to grow as an ephemeral. It usually germinates in the fall and grows quickly through winter and early spring, gaining a competitive edge in the race to occupy space. Cheatgrass produces phenomenal amounts of seed.

It was introduced an unknown number of times with ship ballast and as a contaminant in shipments of seed, and was intentionally introduced for an experiment in pullman, wash., in 1898. We know that it was established in pennsylvania and new york as early as 1860. It swept through the great basin and portions of the columbia river basin like wildfire, essentially establishing its present distribution in the early 1900s with extensive populations in oregon, idaho, washington, nevada, utah and the eastern edge of california. Cheatgrass has largely decimated the unique plant communities in the great basin, which were known for a variety of perennial bunchgrasses. These communities were quite different from the grassland communities of the great plains, which were composed primarily of perennial grasses whose large, intertwined root and rhizome systems formed a matrix so thick that early settlers used it to build sod houses. Advertisement in contrast, the bunchgrasses of the great basin grew literally as clumps of grass, often with bare dirt between them. Sadly, the bunchgrasses have been largely displaced by cheatgrass, which can form monocultures like the one in the accompanying photograph. A series of characteristics make cheatgrass a superior competitor: remarkable ability to change the timing of the life cycle, production of numerous seeds, extremely dense populations and its propensity to support fires. On any site, cheatgrass can germinate in the fall to grow as a winter annual, germinate in the spring with the bunchgrasses, or skip years altogether to grow as an ephemeral. It usually germinates in the fall and grows quickly through winter and early spring, gaining a competitive edge in the race to occupy space. Cheatgrass produces phenomenal amounts of seed.

In fact, the optimistic participants did spend longer trying to find the character — but they only performed 5 % better than others, and that wasn't statistically significant. \" what we concluded from that was that optimism seems to help persistence, but not necessarily performance as much as people would expect, \" tenney says in the podcast, as humanresourcesonline.net notes. ( if optimism doesn't get you ahead, at least it may be good for your heart. )",

        "summary": "When it comes to eating meat, spiders do their share — and then some. Zoologists at the university of basel in switzerland and lund university in sweden report in the journal the science of nature that, according to their calculations, spiders kill between 400 million and 800 million tons of prey every year. The planet's 7.5 billion humans, by comparison, consume 400 million tons of meat and fish a year, per the un's food and agriculture organization, while the prey kill of whales is 500 million tons at most, reports new scientist. Seabirds pick off a relatively paltry 70 million tons. Spiders may be small and light, but there are 45,000 different species of them that can reach population densities of 1,000 per square meter, per phys.org, and taken together, they weigh roughly 25 million tons. ( that's right, they far out-eat their own weight. Humans ' animal consumption is closer to that of our own weight, which per a 2012 study cited by live science is 316 million tons. ) and while spiders do eat some vertebrates, including small mammals, frogs, and birds, their primary role is as insect predator; 90 % of their prey are either insects or springtails, which are insect-like arthropods. Per the study, the researchers hope to \" raise public awareness and increase the level of appreciation for the important global role of spiders in terrestrial food webs. \" ( yes, this spider is carrying a mouse up a fridge. )",

To say that's unlikely is an understatement: between five and six out of every one million people are diagnosed with the rare eye cancer, yet two of mccrary's friends also had it; the three attended auburn university in alabama together. Another auburn alum was also diagnosed; the women started a facebook page to look for other alums dealing with the same cancer — and 36 people have gotten in touch so far, mccrary tells cbs. According to the page, most of those affected attended auburn between 1983 and 2001. Last month, wltz reported that at least 31 people who attended or worked at the university from 1980 to the early 1990s have been diagnosed with ocular melanoma. Earlier this month, healthline put the number diagnosed in the area at 33. Similarly, a number of people in the huntersville, north carolina, area have also been diagnosed with ocular melanoma, also known as uveal melanoma. Cbs puts the number at 18, while wfae reports that 23 people who lived, worked, or spent significant time in mecklenburg county since 2000 have been diagnosed with the disease. Many of the patients in both areas are young women, newsweek reports, despite the fact that the disease is typically more common in older people and men. Officials have so far been unable to determine what might be causing the apparent clusters of cases ( though the alabama department of health's official stance is that \" it would be premature to determine that a cancer cluster exists in the area \" ), but doctors in philadelphia are studying the patients, some of whom travel there for treatment in a clinical trial. Doctors at columbia university are also studying the tumors of diagnosed patients, and auburn university has put together a committee to investigate.",

The arrests, which nabbed the town's accounting chief and the head of the traffic police, among others, come during a continuing countrywide sting against what the local calls \" public sector shirkers. \" some of those shirkers weren't exactly inconspicuous: a police video shows at least one man fiddling with a security camera, then putting a cardboard box over his head before running two timecards through the machine; the local says at least two people were caught on tape going the cardboard-box-on-head route. Twenty-three boscotrecase employees in total were busted, with six placed under house arrest, four suspended for six months, and 13 suspended for an entire year. And the other handful of employees who ( so far ) haven't tried any funny business? the local notes they can get in trouble if they pretend they don't see what their colleagues are doing.

        "summary": "Missouri women who want an abortion may soon have to wait three full days before getting one. The state house voted 111-39 last night to approve legislation that will require a 72-hour waiting period. The state senate had passed it earlier this week, and now it heads to gov. Jay nixon's desk. It's not clear whether he ' ll sign the bill, the news-leader reports; he's signed other abortion-related bills, but has also vetoed bills limiting access to contraception. Hundreds of protesters took to the steps of the missouri capitol on monday to stage a 72-hour \" women's filibuster \" of the bill, a protest scheduled to end this afternoon, the huffington post reports. Opponents say the bill will make it more difficult for poor women, in particular, to get an abortion: the state has just one abortion clinic, in st. Louis, and the bill would require women to get an appointment with the physician, then wait 72 hours before having the procedure — meaning women would need to travel to st. Louis twice or spend three days in the city. The bill seems \" designed to demean and shame a woman in an effort to change her mind, \" says one democratic state rep, who argues that women don't make the decision lightly in the first place. Only south dakota and utah currently have similar waiting periods.",

While the company did tell regulators it had up to 54,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on hand, it said there was \" no \" fire or explosive risk, fox news reports. It said the absolute worst-case scenario would be an essentially harmless 10-minute gas leak. In other developments: rick perry is asking the federal government to declare an emergency for the area, the dallas morning news reports. \" last night was truly a nightmare scenario, \" he said. \" this tragedy has most likely hit every family and touched practically everyone in that town. \" three to four volunteer firefighters are among the missing, as is the west city secretary. The blast destroyed as many as 75 buildings. The streets of the town are carpeted with the glass of storefront windows, and one 50-unit apartment complex stands with its brick facade blown completely away. Documents obtained by the dallas morning news indicate that regulators didn't issue a permit for the facility until after it was already in use, and that they were well aware of its proximity to homes and a school. Columnist tod robberson writes that the incident should be a wake-up call to cities to zone dangerous businesses more carefully. \" someone needs to be called to account, \" he writes.

While that's less than 0.1 % of the department of defense's total budget, it's also about as much as latvia's entire defense budget, reports fox news.

        "summary": "The government shutdown is dragging on thanks in no small part to two men: john boehner and harry reid. Boehner, the washington post points out, could almost certainly pass a clean cr and end the shutdown if he wanted to — but he'd have to rely on a coalition of mostly democrats and a handful of gop moderates ( 19 are on record as supporting it ). Doing that would weaken his hand in debt ceiling negotiations, blow up his uneasy alliance with the tea party, and probably cost him his speaker gig. Reid, meanwhile, is in take-no-prisoners mode; in a cutthroat move yesterday, he leaked email conversations he'd had with boehner about preserving health care subsidies for congress, the new york times reports. That had the predictable effect of angering conservatives, and led glenn beck to brand boehner a \" lying thief, \" according to politico. Reid has long believed democrats will get their best deal by holding out in a shutdown. His staff quashed white house talks last week, the wall street journal reports, and he didn't exactly support yesterday's session. \" it's not my meeting, \" he told reporters. Afterward, he said, \" we're through playing these little games. … we're locked in tight on obamacare. \" of course, these two aren't the only ones feeling the heat: ted cruz is under fire as well.",

But when he turned to follow the sound, he suddenly disappeared, falling down a 23-foot-deep hole in a rural yard and jump-starting a rescue attempt that would take more than three hours, notes abc news. The dog, which had been missing for several days, and gabe somehow fell through an opening that was only 18 inches wide, requiring the assistance of a trench rescue team to retrieve them, per the daily leader. Complicating matters was the fact that, even though he wasn't stuck, gabe didn't fully understand how to attach the rope that rescuers sent down into the hole to pull him up. \" we had people show up with trackhoes... With all kinds of equipment just to come out and help, \" the lincoln county sheriff tells abc, adding to the clarion-ledger, \" just seeing him so close but so far was the hardest part. \" two firemen handling the rope were finally able to talk him through the attachment process and they pulled him up to safety around 8pm, followed shortly by his dog, the clarion-ledger reports. \" when we got him to the top of the hole and were able to get our hands on him, we were ecstatic, \" a fire captain tells the paper.

Nuclear expert greg jones tells the wall street journal. The company, green pine, is listed by the un as pyongyang's \" primary arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons. \" north korea is naturally rich in the material and while it does have plenty of non-military uses, analysts say both the purity and the amount of the lithium-6 the state-owned company was trying to sell suggest it was intended for use in fission devices.

        "summary": "More than 400 years after pocahontas is said to have saved british settler john smith from being killed by her father, chief powhatan, her tribe is being officially recognized by the us government. The pamunkey tribe, which has lived on or near some 1,200 acres in rural virginia for several hundred years, has dwindled to 208 members, only a quarter of whom still live on the reservation thanks to job scarcity, reports the los angeles times. \" we were a tribe here before the us government existed, \" says one tribal council member. The designation makes the pamunkey tribe the 567th to be recognized federally in the country but the very first in the state of virginia, reports nonprofit quarterly. Over the past 10 years, the department of interior has approved 18 tribal applications and rejected 35, and it took 35 years for the pamunkey tribe to gain its own, a long road that was not without its bumps. The congressional black caucus, for one, opposed the designation as recently as january because of the tribe's murky history banning interracial marriage, though tribe members claim this was deeply entwined with virginia's own 1924 racial integrity act and is no longer upheld. Also in opposition: those who stand to lose money if the tribe opens a casino or retail stores — mgm grand and the association of american convenience stores among them. ( archaeologists are working to resurrect the site where pocahontas and john rolfe married. )",

Of particular note: \" we see effects in the single households that are much stronger than in multiple-person households, \" says uppsala university epidemiology professor and co-author tove fall, who's now has a 5-month-old puppy. \" if you have a dog you neutralize the effects of living alone. \" dog owners who lived alone had a 33 % lower mortality rate over the course of a dozen years than single non-owners, and 11 % lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Dogs owners who also lived with other humans had a 15 % lower mortality rate than their counterparts with spotless couches. The study tracked swedes in a national health registry, and while the results don't point to a reason why dog owners are healthier, notes the guardian, the boost among those who live alone may be because \" a dog may stand in as an important family member in single households, \" says lead researcher mwenya mubanga. \" it may be that dog owners like to be outdoors more, or are more organized, or more empathic, \" adds fall.

            "Abstract though religion has been shown to have generally positive effects on normative 'prosocial ' behavior, recent laboratory research suggests that these effects may be driven primarily by supernatural punishment. Supernatural benevolence, on the other hand, may actually be associated with less prosocial behavior. Here, we investigate these effects at the societal level, showing that the proportion of people who believe in hell negatively predicts national crime rates whereas belief in heaven predicts higher crime rates. These effects remain after accounting for a host of covariates, and ultimately prove stronger predictors of national crime rates than economic variables such as gdp and income inequality. Expanding on laboratory research on religious prosociality, this is the first study to tie religious beliefs to large-scale cross-national trends in pro- and anti-social behavior.

            "Abstract though religion has been shown to have generally positive effects on normative 'prosocial ' behavior, recent laboratory research suggests that these effects may be driven primarily by supernatural punishment. Supernatural benevolence, on the other hand, may actually be associated with less prosocial behavior. Here, we investigate these effects at the societal level, showing that the proportion of people who believe in hell negatively predicts national crime rates whereas belief in heaven predicts higher crime rates. These effects remain after accounting for a host of covariates, and ultimately prove stronger predictors of national crime rates than economic variables such as gdp and income inequality. Expanding on laboratory research on religious prosociality, this is the first study to tie religious beliefs to large-scale cross-national trends in pro- and anti-social behavior.

Self-described heavy coffee drinker david nagy says he came up with the idea with brother adam while in london, and the brothers aren't sharing their production process except to say it involves methods never used before. They say it's safe, however, with arabica beans, water, and no chemicals or sweeteners. The label notes that a 200ml bottle has 100mg of caffeine, on par with a typical cup of coffee. So how does it taste? metro uk proclaims it \" odd but not unpleasant. In fact, it's very drinkable. \" but one of its tasters detects \" the aftertaste of cheap wine \" and suggests it would go well with a \" splash of rum. \" in fact, mixologists are already putting the vowel-challenged beverage to that use, notes refinery29. If you want to sample it, you ' ll have to go to london ( whole foods is among the retailers stocking it there ), or order it online, where a two-pack of 200ml bottles costs $ 7.50.

What happens next is unclear. The senate panel's chairman, charles grassley, said he planned to talk to both kavanaugh and ford by phone before asking anyone to appear before the panel, but democrats want the fbi to take control and handle any investigation from here, reports the washington post. In the meantime, they want the confirmation process postponed. Meanwhile, the white house is sticking by kavanaugh, though trump adviser kellyanne conway said on fox monday morning that ford \" should be heard, \" adding that \" this woman should not be ignored and should not be insulted. \" conway also called kavanaugh \" a man of character and integrity. \"",

The final four were kline and reps. Blake farenthold ( r-tex. ), mike coffman ( r-colo. ) and renee ellmers ( r-n.c. ). Maher made the announcement friday from his show in washington, d.c. Maher in 2012 donated $ 1 million to the super pac devoted to reelecting president obama, so it's clear he puts his money where his mouth is. But in targeting kline, that money is probably going to be poorly spent. That's because kline, quite simply, isn't a democratic target. Yes, he comes from a swingy suburban district in the twin cities suburbs -- a district that went by the narrowest of margins for president obama in 2012 and by slightly more in 2008. On its surface, it would seem ripe. But kline has never taken less than 54 percent of the vote, including when he was an actual target in the 2012 election. As it happens, kline faces a rematch this year with the same guy he beat by eight points in 2012, former state rep. Mike obermueller"

Kline's opponent, democrat mike obermueller, released a statement lauding the decision and said it confirmed his own reasons for trying to take kline out. \"our momentum is building every day. And even with this attention, our efforts won't change. We're continuing to build our campaign on the strength",
            "Comedian bill maher announced friday night that he will personally target republican rep. John kline ( minn. ) for defeat in the november election -- the culmination of his longstanding \" flip a district \" contest in which the hbo host allowed his viewers to pick which republican he would attempt to unseat. The final four were kline and reps. Blake farenthold ( r-tex. ), mike coffman ( r-colo. ) and renee ellmers ( r-n.c. ). Maher made the announcement friday from his show in washington, d.c. Maher in 2012 donated $ 1 million to the super pac devoted to reelecting president obama, so it's clear he puts his money where his mouth is. But in targeting kline, that money is probably going to be poorly spent. That's because kline, quite simply, isn't a democratic target. Yes, he comes from a swingy suburban district in the twin cities suburbs -- a district that went by the narrowest of margins for president obama in 2012 and by slightly more in 2008. On its surface, it would seem ripe. But kline has never taken less than 54 percent of the vote, including when he was an actual target in the 2012 election. As it happens, kline faces a rematch this year with the same guy he beat by eight points in 2012, former state rep. Mike obermueller"

        "summary": "A beautiful and probably deadly plant preserved in amber for years has turned out to be a species completely new to science. The new species, which has been named strychnos electri, was identified from two tiny flowers perfectly preserved in amber found in a mine in the dominican republic. It is the oldest specimen ever found in the americas of a plant group called asterids, which includes coffee, tomatoes, and olive trees, reports popular science. There are few fossils of this species and different methods of dating them, meaning the flowers could be anywhere from 15 million to 45 millions years old, researchers write in the journal nature plants. \" the specimens are beautiful, perfectly preserved fossil flowers, which at one point in time were borne by plants that lived in a steamy tropical forest with both large and small trees, climbing vines, palms, grasses and other vegetation, \" biologist george poinar, whose research on insects trapped in amber inspired jurassic park, says in an oregon state university press release. The specimens show that \" asterids, which later gave humans all types of foods and other products, were already evolving many millions of years ago, \" he says. The philadelphia inquirer notes that, as the name suggests, strychnos electri is a cousin of the deadly poison strychnine, though it could also have medicinal properties.

Ruthanne tells the spokesman-review her daughter started to \" disguise herself \" in the mid-2000s after the family adopted four african-american children ( the washington post says two are black ). The city of spokane says it's investigating whether dolezal falsely ided herself as black on her application to serve on the city's citizen police ombudsman commission, kxly reports. \" that question is not as easy as it seems. There's a lot of complexities … and i don't know that everyone would understand that, \" dolezal, 37, told the spokesman yesterday by phone regarding her race. \" we're all from the african continent, \" she added. Dolezal has been in the news recently after saying she had been the victim of various hate crimes, including receiving hate mail in the naacp's post office box — mail that some have insinuated dolezal planted herself, per the spokesman. Larry dolezal tells the post that his daughter attended howard university on a full scholarship after the school \" took her for a black woman, \" and that \" she assimilated into [ the african-american ] culture so strongly that that's where she transferred her identity. \" family photos the dolezals provided to various media show a smiling, blond girl who appears to be a young rachel. Meanwhile, when a kxly reporter approached rachel wednesday to ask her about a january naacp facebook post showing her with a black man said to be her father, she at first agreed it was her dad, but when the reporter kept pressing, things got very awkward.

Some possibilities: chronic medical problems, financial stress during the economic downturn, social isolation, a failure to get treatment for mental-health issues, and more \" access to lethal means, \" including opiates. The suicide rate rose 89 % and 38 % for native american women and men of all ages, respectively, but declined by 8 % among black men of all ages. The rate also declined for older adults, though men over 75 still have the highest suicide rate overall with 38.8 per 100,000 in 2014. The method of death is also altered: suicide via hanging and other forms of suffocation rose during the study period to about 26 % of all suicides.

            "– indiana university is buying up 11 internet domain names using a new suffix meant for pornography sites in order to protect the schools reputation and trademarks. University officials say theyre spending about $ 2,200 to secure for 10 years the site names using the .xxx suffix that was approved in march by the organization overseeing the internet address system. if someone were interested in using our name or our trademarks for one of these.xxx sites, it would cost us several thousand dollars to fight it legally,  valerie gill, the universitys director of licensing and trademarks, told the herald-times. The domain names the university is securing include indianauniversity.xxx, hoosiers.xxx, iupui.xxx and others based on the initials of ius regional campuses. Other universities around the country are taking similar steps before the.xxx addresses become available to the public this week. were not trying to think of every variation of girls gone wild or girls of indiana or hoosier girls,  gill said. the possibilities are endless, and we could be spending thousands and thousands on that. ",

        "summary": "A full-scale riot erupted at nebraska's tecumseh state correctional institution as corrections officers tried to break up inmates gathering in the yard yesterday afternoon. By the time the smoke cleared, two inmates were dead inside a housing unit, two more were shot ( one with a rubber bullet, one with real ammo ), two guards had been assaulted, and a handful of fires were burning over demands for better inmate treatment, 10/11 reports. \" we've pretty much taken the whole prison, \" inmate jeffry frank told the journal-star last night via phone. \" the ceilings are fallen. There's drywall on fire. There's cameras torn down. \" another inmate called his mother, telling her, \" the inmates have taken over the prison, \" per the omaha world herald. Prisoner daryl eskridge said the riot was because inmates ' pleas ( and petition ) for better conditions appeared to fall on deaf ears, per the journal-star. \" we understand this is a prison, but we have been subjected to a lot of things the department doesn't want people to see, \" eskridge says, citing inadequate access to the prison and yards, inmates ' inability to get jobs, awful living conditions, and harassment. \" we just want fairness, \" frank tells the paper. \" we've got guards who don't know how to treat a person. We're in a prison, but we're human beings, too. \" all four injured men were treated and are expected to be ok. ( inmates control a significant percentage of mexico's prisons. )",

The nebraska state patrol is investigating the deaths. Inmate peacock, donald #79816, ( dob 3/15/1969 ), was serving 40 to 50 years from dodge county for 1st degree sexual assault on a child and visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct.

            "An armenian plane sits on the tarmac after landing at erzurum airport, eastern turkey october 15, 2012. Ankara ( reuters ) - turkey ordered an armenian plane flying to the syrian city of aleppo to land and searched its cargo on monday, in the latest move to prevent its airspace being used to supply the syrian military. The plane was allowed to continue on its way after the search in the eastern turkish city of erzurum confirmed it was carrying humanitarian aid as stated by armenian officials, a turkish deputy prime minister said. Last wednesday turkey forced down a syrian airliner that had come from moscow, and said it had found russian munitions on board destined for syria's armed forces. Nato-member turkey has become increasingly assertive in challenging syrian president bashar al-assad in the face of growing tensions along the border and banned all syrian aircraft from its airspace in the wake of that incident. \" the plane was ordered to land and it was inspected. It was clear that the declaration was correct and the plane was given permission to take off, \" deputy prime minister bulent arinc told reporters.

That conclusion, of which president obama and other senior officials are aware from classified assessments of the syrian conflict that has now claimed more than 25,000 lives, casts into doubt whether the white house's strategy of minimal and indirect intervention in the syrian conflict is accomplishing its intended purpose of helping a democratic-minded opposition topple an oppressive government, or is instead sowing the seeds of future insurgencies hostile to the united states. \"the opposition groups that are receiving the most of the lethal aid are exactly the ones we don't want to have it, \" said one american official familiar with the outlines of those findings, commenting on an operation that in american eyes has increasingly gone awry. The united states is not sending arms directly to the syrian opposition. Instead, it is providing intelligence and other support for shipments of secondhand light weapons like rifles and grenades into syria, mainly orchestrated from saudi arabia and qatar. The reports indicate that the shipments organized from qatar, in particular, are largely going to hard-line islamists. The assessment"

That conclusion, of which president obama and other senior officials are aware from classified assessments of the syrian conflict that has now claimed more than 25,000 lives, casts into doubt whether the white house's strategy of minimal and indirect intervention in the syrian conflict is accomplishing its intended purpose of helping a democratic-minded opposition topple an oppressive government, or is instead sowing the seeds of future insurgencies hostile to the united states. \"the opposition groups that are receiving the most of the lethal aid are exactly the ones we don't want to have it, \" said one american official familiar with the outlines of those findings, commenting on an operation that in american eyes has increasingly gone awry. The united states is not sending arms directly to the syrian opposition. Instead, it is providing intelligence and other support for shipments of secondhand light weapons like rifles and grenades into syria, mainly orchestrated from saudi arabia and qatar.
