        "summary": "Yesterday's esquire opus on the seal team 6 shooter who killed osama bin laden, left the navy after 16 years, and now finds himself unemployed with no pension or health coverage, made waves. And it continues to today, thanks to the assertion by stars and stripes that the piece, written by phil bronstein, got one thing majorly wrong: \" the shooter, \" as he is called, is actually \" automatically eligible \" for five years of health care on the va's dime, as are all iraq and afghanistan combat veterans, it reports. The editors of esquire responded today, by tearing stars and stripes ' assertion apart. Not only did they fault inaccuracies and trouble spots in the article ( for instance, the headline, \" esquire article wrongly claims seal who killed bin laden is denied healthcare, \" is false, because bronstein never reported the shooter was denied it ), but they explain that, like many veterans, the shooter wasn't aware the benefits existed. But the heart of their rebuttal is this: \" while the shooter may be eligible for some direct benefits from the va, his wife and two children are eligible for nothing. Not to get too deeply into the philosophy of insurance and the distribution of risk, but that means that under the best scenario, the shooter is 1/4 covered, which of course means that he is not covered at all. It would be like having a 1/4 roof during a storm. Your house still fills with water. \" click for the stars and stripes article and esquire's response.",

An officer tells the dayton daily news that the child was uninjured, but \" her saving grace \" was that the car was running with the heater on. It isn't clear how long russell's body sat slumped over the steering wheel before it was discovered by the property manager around 9: 30am wednesday, reports wlwt and the cincinnati enquirer. Russell lived about 30 miles away in middletown, and police are trying to retrace her last steps. What they know so far: russell convinced a babysitter to let her take her daughter, haven, around noon on tuesday, though she didn't have custody. Haven's father, chris edwards, says russell told him over the phone that she would return the child later that night. A witness tells abc 22 that she saw russell's car running in the apartment parking lot around 11pm tuesday and then spotted it again several hours later. But it wasn't until russell failed to show up at edwards home by 5am that he called police. According to a police report, edwards said russell — also the mother of a 10-year-old girl — was planning to give a ride to a drug dealer. His mother adds that russell suffered from heroin addiction but had been clean in recent weeks and was scheduled to start a treatment program. Police say they found no drugs in her vehicle. There was no gun, either, and authorities say they don't believe russell was robbed.",

Researchers found that there was a decrease in the function of volunteers ' leg arteries after just an hour of sitting down, but problems with blood flow were reversed among those who took five-minute breaks to walk on a treadmill every hour, reports medical news today. The volunteers were men between 20 and 35 with no serious health problems. \" they were inactive people, though; they did not exercise regularly, \" the lead researcher tells the washington post. \" there is a risk that people who don't exercise can start sitting more and more. That's why we chose that population. \" the study didn't look into the benefits of standing versus sitting, but the lead researcher says he believes it was the muscle movement of walking that improved blood flow.

        "summary": "The antikythera shipwreck is a gift that keeps on giving. First discovered in 1900 by sponge divers and dating to about 65bc, it has been explored multiple times in the decades since, including in 1976 when jacques-yves cousteau and his crew surfaced with almost 300 objects, including human remains. Now a may 22-june 11 return to the shipwreck off the greek island of antikythera in the aegean sea has yielded 60 new artifacts, including a gold ring, luxury glassware, and a bronze spear that would have been part of a statue. The woods hole oceanographic institution, which led the effort with the hellenic ministry of culture, also flags one particularly unusual item that may have served to protect the ship from pirates. The lead and iron artifact weighs about 220 pounds and is believed to be what's known as a \" dolphin, \" reports the huffington post. The idea is that it would be dropped from high up on the mast onto an enemy ship's deck. \" our new technologies extend capabilities for marine science, \" marine archaeologist brendan foley says, technologies that in this instance included using an autonomous robot to detail 2.6 acres of the site in advance of the dive. The ap reports none of the latest finds are linked to the shipwreck's best-known artifact, the antikythera mechanism, which the atlantic calls \" one of the most intriguing objects in the history of technology \" and gizmodo describes as a \" freakishly advanced \" analog computer more than 1,000 years ahead of its time. After 12 years of work, some 3,500 characters of text found on the bronze remnants — as delicate as phyllo dough, says foley — have been deciphered. The team that read the text earlier this month likened the mechanism to \" a textbook of astronomy...

Astronomers have already used the new optics system, called magao, to capture a picture of two stars they've never been able to separate before. \" i have been imagining theta 1 ori c for over 20 years and never could i directly see that it was in fact two stars, \" says a scientist from the university of arizona, per cbs news. \" but as soon as we turned on the magao system it was beautifully split into two stars just 0.032 arcseconds apart. \" as for the good old hubble, it recently found a blue planet — not that you'd want to visit.",

Conducted by researchers at the university of east anglia, the review analyzed people from asia, australia, europe, and north america; most were given omega-3 supplements and compared to those who took a dummy pill, per a press release. In the end, supplement-takers had an 8.8 % chance of death compared to 9 % in the control group, with little to no difference in heart-health events like stroke, heart irregularities, and coronary heart disease. \" we can be confident in the findings of this review which go against the popular belief that long-chain omega 3 supplements protect the heart, \" says lead author lee hooper. \" despite all this information, we don't see protective effects. \" that said, those who ingested more of an omega-3 acid called ala ( found in walnuts and plant oils like canola and grapeseed ) had a slight chance of reducing heart irregularities. But overall it's better to eat oily fish like salmon or herring, business insider reports — because then \" you're also getting a protein source that replaces something else in your diet like saturated fat, and seafood has selenium, iron and vitamin d, \" says hooper. \" all of these are useful nutrients. \" seems fish oils have been falsely praised since a bad english study of school children over 10 years ago, per an old guardian article.",

It's also seeking diplomatic assistance easing the path to citizenship for the children of caribbean people who have moved to africa.

Three fox subspecies found only on the state's channel islands have made a big comeback since they were placed on the endangered species list in 2004 and have just been removed. No mammal on the list has made a faster recovery, reports ap. The foxes are only the size of house cats and had nearly been eradicated by golden eagles. How that happened illustrates an odd chain reaction: those carnivorous eagles had been drawn to the islands in the 19th century when settlers brought livestock, the washington post explains. They feasted on piglets, then discovered the foxes — which had been on the islands for thousands of years — and all but wiped them out in the ensuing decades. The recovery plan had several components. Wildlife officials first moved the predator golden eagles to northern california and re-introduced fish-eating bald eagles to the islands. They also bred foxes in captivity for release in the wild. Now an estimated 6,000 of the diminutive critters are back on the islands, up from the perilous figure of under 200 not too long ago. \" we're ecstatic that we've reached this point so quickly, \" says a us fish and wildlife service rep.",

        "summary": "Some four decades after two girls went missing in montgomery county, maryland, no one has been charged in the case. But in newly unsealed affidavits, police outline a theory of what might have happened to the lyon sisters, the washington post reports. Sheila, 12, and katherine, 10, disappeared after a visit to a mall in 1975. The affidavits suggest they were kidnapped from the mall before at least one of them was sexually assaulted. Both were then murdered and their bodies were left on a mountainside, according to the documents. They note that a person of interest in the case, convicted sex offender lloyd welch, then 18, said years later that he departed the mall \" in a vehicle with the lyon sisters on the day they disappeared. \" welch emerged in the case long ago when, shortly after the disappearance, he told mall security he'd seen a man leave with the girls in a car, the ap reports. In a 1998 interview — during which welch was in prison after having pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a different 10-year-old girl — welch linked his uncle, richard welch, now 69, to the kidnapping, the affidavits say. Lloyd welch said he, his uncle, and a juvenile relative were in the car with the girls. After lloyd was dropped off at home, the others remained in the car; the following day, the younger man saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the sisters at the uncle's home, he said. He added that he left and \" never saw the lyon sisters again, \" note the affidavits. The juvenile family member who lloyd welch said was in the car, however, now tells the post he wasn't, and that he doesn't believe his uncle was connected to the disappearance. \" if lloyd did this, i hope he fries for it, \" says thomas welch jr.

            "Testing captions in elton john's recent interview with parade, he spoke about his past relationships, fame and drugs. But it was the statement he made regarding christianity that has sparked a strong reaction from william donohue, president of the catholic league, among others. Donohue doesn't agree with john, who said \"jesus was a compassionate, super-intelligent gay man. \" in a statement to showbiz tonight and cnn donohue says, \"jesus was certainly compassionate, but to say he was'super-intelligent ' is to compare the son of god to a successful game-show contestant, \" donohue added. \"more seriously, to call jesus gay is to label him a sexual deviant. But what else would we expect from a man who previously said, ' from my point of view, i would ban religion completely. ' \"",

The statement, finally agreed upon after three days of talks, \" condemn[ s ] widespread violations of human rights \" and calls on both sides to stop the violence. Western powers wanted a stronger statement or even a resolution, but russia and china were among the nations insisting against such a move. In a rare move, syria's neighboring nation lebanon disassociated itself from the statement, al-jazeera reports. Meanwhile, violence continued, particularly in hama, where an activist says 45 more civilians have been killed since yesterday. Reuters offers terrifying accounts, though not independently verified: five people, including two children, killed as they tried to flee; tanks advancing into central hama; snipers appearing on rooftops. The us and turkey have hardened their stances, with a white house spokesman stating that \" syria would be a better place without president assad \" and the turkish deputy pm stating that syria is \" making a big mistake. \" a london-based human rights observatory says 1,629 civilians and 374 security force members have been killed since march.",

        "summary": "An oil barge recently discovered at the bottom of lake erie — nearly 80 years after it sank — has brought a renewed focus to the environmental dangers posed by dozens of shipwrecks littering american waters, the detroit free press reports. According to the ap, 87 shipwrecks are included on a federal registry of the greatest pollution threats to us waters. Approximately 75 % of those vessels sank more than 70 years ago — a lot of them were torpedoed by german submarines in wwii — meaning it's only a matter of time until they start leaking oil or other substances due to rust and corrosion, if they haven't already. But cleaning up those wrecks is easier said than done. Only half of the 87 shipwrecks on the list have even been found, the ap reports. And those are just the wrecks we know about. \" we could look every year for 100 years and not find all of the shipwrecks on the great lakes, \" a local historian tells the free press. And even the shipwrecks that have been found often haven't been examined for leaks, the ap reports. \" some of these are wicked deep and not in an area where you could do survey work, \" says lisa symons of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, which started looking at potential environmental threats from shipwrecks in 2010. Finally, there simply isn't enough money for a cleanup operation that size. Fortunately, disaster isn't imminent. According to noaa, any leaking oil is likely to come out in drips rather than catastrophic gushes.",

Without that compromise, \"google would effectively go dark in china, \" chief legal officer david drummond wrote on the company blog.

Missouri became the first state to switch to a one-drug lethal injection protocol, and planned to use high doses of propofol. But death row inmates challenged the plan, and the state supreme court put executions on hold until the matter is settled. But the state's supplies of propofol are expiring, with the last batch set to become useless in 2015. \" as each supply expires, the department's ability to carry out lawfully imposed capital sentences diminishes, \" koster said in a motion filed with the court. \" unless the court changes its current course, the legislature will soon be compelled to fund statutorily-authorized alternative methods of execution to carry out lawful judgments, \" aka the gas chamber. Missouri hasn't used the gas chamber since 1965, and one attorney helping with the propofol challenge says he doubts the court would allow it to be brought back: \" its use has fallen into disrepute. \" oh, and then there's the fact that the old gas chamber is now a tourist attraction, the ap notes.",

            "With drugs needed for lethal injection in short supply and courts wrangling over how to execute prisoners without them, missouri's attorney general is floating one possible solution: bring back the gas chamber. In court filings and interviews this week, attorney general chris koster noted that missouri statutes allow two options for executions: lethal injection and death by gas. Koster's comments come amid his growing frustration over the missouri supreme court's refusal to set execution dates until lethal injection issues are resolved. \" the missouri death penalty statute has been, in my opinion, unnecessarily entangled in the courts for over a decade, \" koster said wednesday in an email exchange with the associated press. Asked about concerns by some who say using lethal gas could violate condemned inmates ' constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment, koster responded: \" the premeditated murder of an innocent missourian is cruel and unusual punishment.

Then comes the not-so-typical twist: the same mom develops an all-natural tick spray that is showing promise in tests at a canadian university. As the chronicle herald reports, lisa ali of nova scotia came up with a product she calls atlantick that combines lemon grass, witch hazel, jojoba oil, and water. All of those ingredients are sold legally in canada, but because ali combined them into a spray that is labeled as a tick repellent, she needs the permission of canada's pest management regulatory agency to actually sell it. Solution? she obtained research funding and is now working with researchers at acadia university. And so far, so good. \" the results are pretty interesting because the atlantick body spray repelled about 75, 80 % of the tested ticks, \" researcher nicoletta faraone tells the cbc. \" these results were compared to deet, which recorded 100 %. \" ali says she wanted to find an alternative to putting chemicals on her sons'skin, and faraone calls the first results \" encouraging, \" especially for a natural product. Still, more testing awaits, and the spray is at least two years away from being sold commercially. ( in the us, the number of tick-borne diseases is surging. )",

The expected showdown over the legislation is the culmination of months of efforts by tea party-allied freshmen and fellow conservatives to demand a fundamentally smaller government in exchange for raising the federal borrowing limit. Mr. Boehner rolled out a two-stage plan on monday that would allow the $ 14.3 trillion federal debt limit to rise immediately by about $ 1 trillion in exchange for $ 1.2 trillion in spending cuts.

As part of the agreement, amazon will drop its appeal against a court ruling that found it hadn't done enough to make sure parents gave their permission for purchases made in apps like freemium games. The ftc has already reached similar settlements with apple and google for failing to provide enough parental control over such purchases, usa today reports. \" this case demonstrates what should be a bedrock principle for all companies — you must get customers ' consent before you charge them, \" said thomas pahl, chief of the ftc's bureau of consumer protection.

The thrust of the president's tweetstorm was encouraging republicans in the senate to change the rules so they can pass legislation with 51 votes instead of 60. Cnn explains that the senate typically requires 60 votes to defeat a filibuster, which is why republicans have been trying to pass tax reform and health care through the process of reconciliation, which is used for budgetary measures. Reconciliation only requires 51 votes to pass a bill but includes a number of restrictions — getting a bill scored by the cbo, for example. \" reconciliation is killing r's in senate, \" trump tweeted. He went on to accuse republican senators of \" wasting time, \" saying, \" 200 bills sit in senate. A joke! \" the president claimed the current rules are allowing \" 8 dems to control country \" and changing those rules would let republicans \" complete healthcare. \" roll call points out that the final gop health care bill was defeated by three republican senators and that no gop health care bill received even 50 votes this week. Finally, trump tweeted that democrats wouldn't hesitate to change the rules to 51 votes. Aides for republican sen. Mitch mcconnell and democratic sen.

The \" skulls and leg bones stacked up into dense piles like firewood \" were discovered under victorian drainage pipes outside the wall of poets ' corner, where famous literary figures such as charles dickens and rudyard kipling are buried and where memorials have been erected to such notables as chaucer, shakespeare, and jane austen. The estimated date of the remains means the deceased may have witnessed the chaotic events of 1066 in england, including the norman invasion, the guardian notes. The bodies — which were found by archaeologists after a lavatory block \" built as solidly as a nuclear bunker, \" per the excavation's leader, was moved to make way for the abbey's first new tower in 300 years — were believed to have been shoved under the pipes when henry iii was tearing down edward the confessor's church and replacing it with his new abbey in the mid-1200s. The guardian notes that some of the skulls had square holes, likely left by the pickaxes used by 13th-century workers. One of the mysteries from the find: why the 3-year-old, whose gender can't be determined without further tests, was found there, though the fact that the child was buried in a wooden coffin likely means he or she was of high status, per the guardian. The remains will be reburied properly within the abbey after they've been studied. ( an \" exceptional \" find in rome could alter how we view the ancient city. )",

        "summary": "\" in a single night, his life … changed forever. \" so says the host of an australian tv show in her tribute column to sam ballard, a young man who took an ill-advised dare from his friends in 2010 and just died from complications related to that challenge. The new zealand herald reports that ballard — said to be either 27 or 28 — passed away eight years after his pals, during a night of drinking, egged him on to eat a slug. Ballard did, and soon after he started feeling pain in his legs; the independent notes he also started vomiting and had dizzy spells. He ended up falling into a coma for more than a year, and the reason was stunning: he'd been infected with rat lungworm, a parasite usually found in rodents, but which can occasionally end up in snails and slugs if they eat rat excrement. As a result of the parasite, ballard contracted a type of meningitis tied to rat lungworm, and things went downhill from there. The former rugby player had since had limited movement in his limbs, needed help going to the bathroom and eating, and had trouble communicating, though, based on his reactions to things, \" you [ knew he was ] there, \" one of his friends tells the herald. Ballard's mother, who has said she doesn't blame his friends for the slug-eating dare, has been fighting the australian government since at least last october, when her son's disability funding was significantly cut. Lisa wilkinson, the tv host who's interviewed the ballards, says his final words to his mom were: \" i love you. \" ( this teen's friends buried him in sand. Then came the hookworms. )",

Ted cruz, who's seeing sharp rises elsewhere, effectively doubled his support to 15 %, reports the washington post. Meanwhile, ben carson's support went the other way — effectively cut in half — and he and marco rubio are tied for third at 12 %. Jeb bush clocks in at 5 %, chris christie has 4 %, and everyone else is under 2 %. Trump's electability numbers also jumped, notes politico, going from 38 % last month to 47 % of americans who thought he could win the oval office. But this latest poll is far from indicative of what happens come next november, if history is any teacher, notes the post: polling at this point in recent election cycles would have given us presidents named giuliani, gingrich, or clinton ( hillary led barack obama at this point in the 2008 contest ).

A labor dispute that's been dragging on for nine months now is taking an unmistakable toll on retailers all over the us, reports the washington post. The industry as a whole expects to lose a staggering $ 7 billion when the costs of rerouting and delays are factored in, and pretty much any company you can name — walmart, bed bath &amp; beyond, jc penney, levi's, honda, and ralph lauren are among those mentioned in coverage — is struggling to keep up-to-date inventory in stock, reports the wall street journal. Meat and poultry producers are losing an estimated $ 85 million a week because of the slowdown. The dispute is between the pacific maritime association ( representing shipping companies and terminal operations ) and dockworkers who belong to the international longshore and warehouse union. The impasse is so severe that the white house dispatched labor secretary tom perez over the weekend to try to broker a settlement in person. No wonder: given that the ports involved handle half of us maritime trade and 70 % of shipments from asia, the \" domino effect \" on the us economy is widespread and getting worse, reports reuters.",

Rookie cop sherry hall had only been on the job for three months when she was shot on sept. 13. Calling in the incident on her police radio, she reported the perp had been a 6-foot, 230-pound black man and said she'd fired two shots after him after he shot her in the abdomen; she added her bulletproof vest saved her life, per wgcl. Her story sent jackson into a panic, leading residents to think a dangerous gunman could be running around. But as investigators began looking into her story, it fell apart, including the fact that hall had had two guns issued to her by the police department, one of which she allegedly used to plant a shell casing that she blamed on the supposed suspect, per gbi warrants for her arrest. \" there is no person out there with a gun shooting at our police officers, \" towaliga judicial circuit district attorney richard milam said at a friday press conference, per the new york daily news. It's been unearthed that hall was charged with a felony in the ' 90s for damaging property, for which she received five years of probation and a $ 1,700 fine. The police chief reportedly knew about her past; she was said to have been cleared by a police standards group before her hiring. In addition to her termination from the jackson police department, which was announced saturday by the department's chief, per wxga, hall has also been charged with four felonies, including giving false statements to investigators and tampering with evidence. Officials have told both ajc.com and cbs news that hall has checked herself into a private facility and will be arrested on those charges when she gets out.",

The step was likely the victim of the 2015 earthquake that closed the mountain; pictures from last may appeared to show a change in shape, but it was covered in snow so its demise couldn't be verified at the time. British climber tim mosedale reached the summit on tuesday and confirms what had been suspected via facebook. \" it's official - the hillary step is no more, \" he wrote. \" not sure what's going to happen when the snow ridge doesn't form because there's some huge blocks randomly perched hither and thither which will be tricky to negotiate. \" it's unclear whether the newly created terrain will be easier to scale as there won't be a vertical face to conquer, or will create dangerous bottlenecks due to what could be \" limited paths up the section, \" the guardian reports. If it's the latter, climbers would be forced to spend extra time essentially immobile in the cold and at high altitude. The hillary step was named for the first man to climb it: sir edmund hillary managed the feat in 1953. ( earlier this month, a man was found hiding in a cave on everest. )",

She writes, \" it may drive me crazy trying to catch all the corrections we ' ll be reading and seeing in the media.

A new study carried out by scientists from the university of amsterdam and brazil's university of brasilia, published in the global and planetary change journal, upends previous speculation of how old the waterway really is, coming in now with numbers that age the amazon substantially. While some earlier estimates placed the beginnings of the river as recently as 1 million years ago, the new tally backs that figure up to between 9 million and 9.4 million years ago, a press release notes. Researchers used \" high-resolution analytical techniques \" that hadn't been tapped into before to come up with the new number, co-author farid chemale jr. Notes. Specifically, those techniques included examining sediment from an exploration borehole drilled for oil and gas purposes off the coast of brazil, per upi. Scientists found a \" distinct change \" in the makeup of the sediment layer there from the late miocene period, which suggests the river source dumping the sediment changed then from somewhere in the lowlands to further up in the andes, an area from which many believe the amazon originated.

        "summary": "A celebrated green beret admits to killing a man, but insists it wasn't murder — an impression the us army no longer shares, nbc news reports. Army maj. Mathew golsteyn has admitted twice to the 2010 killing of an afghan male in marjah, afghanistan, insisting the victim was a dangerous bomb-maker. But now, after much ado, the us army has charged golsteyn with murder. \" major matthew golsteyn's immediate commander has determined that sufficient evidence exists to warrant the preferral of charges against him, \" says a lieutenant colonel. Golsteyn first acknowledged the killing in a 2010 cia interview, which sparked an army probe and a 2014 reprimand but no formal charges. Then golsteyn admitted to it again during a 2016 fox news interview, saying he believed the alleged bomber would harm others if released — a comment that revived the old army probe. Seems the murder came after two us marines were killed by a bomb in 2010; per military documents, golsteyn and other soldiers uncovered bomb-making materials, hauled in a local suspect, and were close to releasing him when they shot, killed, and buried the man. Later they allegedly dug up his remains and burned them. A source says new evidence contradicts golsteyn's version of events, but he denies any guilt: \" i have had commanders look me in the face and tell me i have done nothing wrong, \" he says. Golsteyn has a distinguished service cross for his valor in battle, the army times notes.",

            "Breaking news emails get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. By carol e. Lee and courtney kube the u.s. Army has charged a decorated green beret with premeditated murder for killing an afghan man in afghanistan nearly a decade ago, according to military legal documents obtained by nbc news. Army maj. Mathew l. Golsteyn is accused of fatally shooting \" a male of apparent afghan descent known as rasoul \" on february 22, 2010, near forward operating base mcquery in marjah, afghanistan. The charge sheet was dated wednesday but golsteyn was read the charge and signed a memo acknowledging it thursday morning. The murder charge was brought in the unusual case seven years after golsteyn disclosed the killing during a cia polygraph test. Golsteyn was applying for a job with the spy agency when he admitted to fatally shooting the man who he said was a suspected taliban bomb maker, military officials said. The disclosure led to the army criminal investigation command ( cid ) launching a probe into golsteyn in late 2011. In april 2014, golsteyn received an official reprimand for his actions, but no formal charges were filed at the time due to a lack of physical evidence, military officials said. Army secretary john mchugh revoked golsteyn's silver star, the third highest award for valor in the military, and took away his special forces tab, a patch awarded to soldiers after completing one of the elite special forces schools. Two years later, golsteyn appeared on a fox news special report entitled, \" how we fight, \" where he admitted to killing the suspected bomb maker. Golsteyn told anchor brett baier he was concerned that if he released the suspected taliban member, the man would target afghans who were providing information to u.s. Soldiers. Baier asked golsteyn if he'd killed the man. \" yes, \" golsteyn replied. The interview breathed new life into what was still a cold case killing, according to a military official familiar with the investigation. \" i ' m here right now because of that interview, \" golsteyn told nbc news thursday. \" i did the interview because i wanted to do some advocacy, not talk about my case or what happened in afghanistan. \" still, golsteyn stands by his comments to baier. He does, however, take issue with comments attributed to him from the 2011 army cid investigation. \" they quoted me as saying that me and someone else with me took a detainee to his home and assassinated him. The problem is i never said",

Ukraine's interior ministry says that four troops have been killed in the city, where pro-russia militants shot down two military helicopters last week, the bbc finds. Gun battles are taking place outside the city; russia's interfax news agency is reporting that at least 20 pro-russian militants have been killed. Ukrainian troops have also reportedly taken a nearby television tower, according to voice of america. More: in odessa, where a blaze killed 42 pro-russia activists friday, militants stormed a police station yesterday to free nearly 70 activists, reuters reports. The militants chanted \" russia \" and \" we will not forgive \" as they smashed their way into the police compound. Ukraine's prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk says the unrest in odessa is all part of moscow's plan to destroy the country. \" russia's aim was to repeat in odessa what is happening in the east of the country, \" he says. As in other cities where pro-russia militants are strong, there appears to be plenty of support for activists among the police in odessa, the guardian finds. Witnesses say the police offered no resistance as militants attacked the station. Yatsenyuk says the region's police chief has been dismissed. Unlike in eastern cities however, odessa has plenty of pro-kiev activists willing to battle pro-russia activists in the streets, reports the new york times, which notes that the city lies between the crimean peninsula and the pro-russian moldovan region of transnistria — and russian president vladimir putin has taken to referring to the entire area by its historical name of novorossiya, or new russia.",

But those with adhd often also experience \" hyperfocus, \" and there is now a growing call for more research into this piece of the disorder, which can be seen in both the inattentive and the hyperactive types. As psychologist brandon ashinoff has said, the disorder presents an \" interesting paradox \" in that people can have an overload of focus instead of a splintered attention span, reports new york magazine. \" the field is wide open and people really need to start researching [ hyperfocus ], \" one researcher says. \" it's not about having an attention deficit, it's more a maldistribution of attention.... Hyperfocus can be very powerful. \" some suggest that people with hyperfocus actually have an advantage over non-adhd folks in that they are able to sustain extreme attention on a task for longer periods than normal. This can be detrimental, of course — focusing on a work project at the expense of one's laundry, or sleep, or attention to family — but notable adults with adhd such as goalkeeper tim howard and musician adam levine say they excel at their jobs thanks to the energy bursts they get from adhd. And while the academic data needs to catch up to the anecdotes, one new study published in the journal medicine and science in sports exercise suggests that short bouts of exercise can improve motivation and energy in adult males with symptoms of adhd.

Whether or not his departure comes in a time and manner of his own choosing — months after an explosion at the company's upper big branch mine killed 29 employees and brought massey's practices under harsh scrutiny, and a week after a scathing rolling stone profile — he's nonetheless likely to make out nicely. That's because massey has been generous with blankenship's pay ( $ 38.2 million total compensation in the last three years alone, $ 26.7 million of it in cash ) and promises to be just as generous with his retirement benefits.

Whether that has anything to do with the shooting, however, remains very much unclear. Details: recent transactions: law enforcement sources tell nbc news that paddock recently made several large gambling transactions. However, it wasn't clear whether they were wins or losses, and \" large \" isn't defined. A regular: brother eric paddock of florida tells the washington post that stephen was a retiree and seemingly well off, and he loved to spend time at casinos. \" my brother is not like you and me. He plays high stakes video poker. He sends me a text that says he won $ 250,000 at the casino. \" eric says he knows of no gambling debts and showed the fbi three years of texts from his brother, none of which mentioned money trouble. Bank robber dad: paddock's father was a bank robber who was once on the fbi's most-wanted list, reports the orlando sentinel. Benjamin hoskins paddock escaped from prison in texas in 1968 when he was eight years into a 20-year sentence. He, too, was described as a frequent gambler. The elder paddock wasn't re-captured until 1978, in oregon. He died in 1998. Old habit: stephen paddock owned a home in a community for 55-and-older residents in brevard county, florida, from 2013-15, though neighbors say he wasn't there much. \"he seemed normal, other than that he lived by gambling, \" says one former neighbor, per tcpalm. \" he was very open about that. \" paddock also lived in a retirement community in reno, nevada, for several years with girlfriend marilou danley, and neighbors there recall him as \" reclusive \" and gone frequently on gambling trips. ( danley has been cleared in the shooting. ) apartments: brother bruce paddock says stephen also made money through apartments he owned with his mother. And in the late 1980s, he worked as \" internal auditor \" for a predecessor of lockheed martin, per nbc news. The company says it is cooperating with authorities about his work there. Lawsuit? a man named stephen paddock sued the cosmopolitan hotel and casino in vegas in 2012, alleging that he slipped on the floor and suffered injuries, reports the las vegas review-journal. The suit was dismissed two years later when both sides dropped the matter",

Whoever was responsible \" just [ left ] them lying \" on the ground without making sure they were dead, the sheriff adds; a few other dogs survived the massacre, and animal shelter workers have been trying to find all the survivors, but one was so badly injured he had to be euthanized later. Investigators are still processing the crime scene, and haven't named any suspects, but the sheriff says he doesn't believe the suspect or suspects stole people's pet dogs. The harrison daily notes that a dog rescue operation was closed down in the area a few years back, but it's not clear whether these dogs were related to that. Whoever did it could face felony charges. Four dogs that have been rescued so far are at the county's humane society shelter. \" they could have found homes for these dogs.

Though onstar alerted police that melissa vasquez's car was involved in a rollover accident monday afternoon, the provided location, near her campbell home, turned up no sign of the vehicle, abc 11 reports. When contacted by police, vasquez's cell company pinpointed her phone within a broad 7-mile radius of san jose's downtown. Officers were still stumped when vasquez's stepmother reported the 28-year-old missing 13 hours later, the san francisco chronicle reports — that is, until officer david cameron visited vasquez's home, learned she owned an ipad, and had an idea. Another call to the cell company revealed the ipad was in the home; it was soon found, but it was locked. \" i made an educated guess based on a series of common numbers people use for passwords and on the third attempt i was able to get in, \" cameron says. He turned on apple's find my iphone feature and had vasquez's location within minutes. Vasquez, whose iphone battery was at 12 %, was found \" face down \" in the ravine in san jose's mountains, her phone out of reach, abc news reports. Though vasquez had been thrown from her vehicle, which was on its roof with two tires ripped off, she was \" awake, coherent, and she was speaking to officers, \" a cop explains. She was airlifted to the hospital with \" major injuries \" to her legs and abdomen but is expected to survive. \" i think somebody was looking out for her. Things fell in place and had those things not fallen in place, it could have been a totally different story, \" says cameron, who plans to visit vasquez soon.

        "summary": "President trump hosts german leader angela merkel at the white house on friday, and the christian science monitor says it could go a long way toward clarifying relations between the us and europe under trump. He's made disparaging comments about the eu, nato, and merkel herself, and analysts say this meeting isn't so much about resolving specific differences as about setting a tone for the path forward. An analysis at deutsche welle notes that the two leaders could hardly be more different in both personality and world view. She is often described as \" calm and collected, \" even \" bland, \" while trump is, well, not bland. On politics, she favors global cooperation, while trump advocates nationalism, and their views on immigration are generally at polar opposites. No shortage of topics could be on the agenda for what cnn calls this \" odd couple, \" and its story takes a look at some likely ones — russia, nato, trade, climate change, refugees, and counterterrorism — and the thorny complications of each. During the campaign, trump accused merkel of \" ruining \" germany with her pro-immigrant policies ( \" i don't know what went wrong with her \" ), and that rhetoric has the potential to complicate friday's meeting, explains the ap. Don't expect a showdown, however, argues this analysis at politico. Germany needs the us more than the us needs germany, and merkel's main task will be to win over the president, writes matthew karnitschnig. And \" if ever there were a politician capable of putting aside personal feelings in pursuit of her country's strategic interests, it's the german chancellor. \" a washington post analysis runs through 10 \" awkward questions \" it hopes trump is asked, starting with, \" do you still stand by earlier comments that nato is ' obsolete '? if so, would you consider withdrawing the tens of thousands [ of ] us troops stationed in germany? \" germany, meanwhile, is threatening to sue trump at the world trade organization if he moves forward with a border tax, per the independent. The guardian looks back at how previous world leaders have fared in their meetings with president trump, complete with images of some awkward handshakes.",

Not every girl is interested in growing up to be cinderella, not even in cranston.this type of stereotyping is contrary to federal law. \" in fact, federal discrimination laws exempt such events, but the state measure does not, say local officials, according to the providence journal",

( george wilhelm / los angeles times / ) father-daughter dances and mother-son ballgames -- those cherished hallmarks of americana -- have been banned in a rhode island school district after they were targeted by the american civil liberties union. The aclu, the self-proclaimed guardian of the nation's liberty, says such events violate the state's gender-discrimination law. The organization challenged their existence following a complaint from a single mom who said her daughter was prevented from attending a father-daughter dance in the cranston public schools district. The story has created a furor both online as well as in cranston, a community located south of providence and considered one of the safest places in america. The phones at cranston city hall were already ringing off the hook bright and early tuesday morning when staffers unlocked the doors. The outrage prompted a reaction from cranston mayor allan fung, even though he has no control over the schools. \" i am utterly disappointed to have such a time-honored tradition under attack, \" fung said in a statement that urged parents to turn their fury on the school district. \" i implore the cranston school committee to review this decision and find a way to make this work for the children and their parents. I encourage all parents that are upset with this decision to contact their school committee members and make their voices be heard. \" oddly enough, the policy change was apparently made months ago but only came to widespread public attention on monday.

The newspaper said schools superintendent judith lundsten told school organizations in an august letter that the district's hands were tied: although federal gender-discrimination laws exempt such events, rhode island's law does not.

        "summary": "Jurors in a high-profile silicon valley case say a prestigious venture capital firm did not discriminate against a female employee. The jury in san francisco reached a verdict today on three of four counts in the lawsuit filed by ellen pao against kleiner perkins caufield &amp; byers. Confusion surrounded the fourth count, one alleging that the company fired pao in retaliation for her lawsuit, reports the wall street journal. A court clerk initially announced that the company had been cleared, but when the judge polled the jury, he found the result was 8-4, not 9-3 as thought. Nine votes are necessary for a decision, and the judge sent the jurors back for more deliberations. If they can't get a ninth vote, that count could end in a hung jury, reports usa today. The case has shined a spotlight on the technology and venture capital sectors, where women are grossly underrepresented. Industry consultants said the case had sparked some companies to re-examine their cultures and practices for potential gender bias. Jurors heard conflicting portraits of pao during closing arguments. Her attorneys said she was an accomplished junior partner who was passed over for a promotion and fired because the firm used different standards to judge men and women. A lawyer for kleiner perkins countered that pao failed as an investor at the company and sued to get a big payout as she was being shown the door.",
