Just after 8am last wednesday she texted her mother, kimberly jones, to say that she \" got dress coded \" and had to wear sweatpants over her flowered leggings because her tunic was too short ( photo of outfit here ). A district rep tells fox4kc, \" the nurse... Measured all the way around \" and the shirt was too short \" in front and in the back. \" bella said she was told she couldn't call her mom and have new clothes brought to school, reports today. The rep says school policy is to get the student back to class asap, rather than wait for a parent to arrive. But after learning what had happened, a shocked jones rushed to lansing middle school — but not before bella had typed, \" i want to move. Can we please move. \" bella's military family had recently moved to kansas, and \" she was begging to move because they embarrassed and harassed her, \" jones writes in a facebook post that had gone viral but has since been removed. \" why? because apparently 13-year-old boys ( she's 11 in 6th grade ) can't control themselves around this. \" jones was incredulous not only because of the rule itself — \" her butt is even covered! \" — but because it wasn't written clearly in the school's dress policy, reports mashable. Leggings have since been specifically prohibited, but jones wrote in her post that while she waited for the principal she saw a teacher walk by with pants so tight her underwear was visible. ( this man's $ 245 pants were deemed \" too street \" for a pizza place. )",

        "summary": "How many americans does smoking kill each year? if you're going by the surgeon general, the answer is about 480,000. But a new study published in the new england journal of medicine suggests the number is actually more like 575,000. The issue is that only 21 causes of death are officially blamed on smoking, the los angeles times explains — think heart disease, stroke, copd, and certain cancers, including lung and esophageal. But those causes of death actually only account for 83 % of deaths among smokers that the study tracked. The rest were caused by things like renal failure, infections, other cancers, and even accidents and suicide, which, the times notes, \" have a more tenuous link to smoking. \" researchers looked at five large studies involving nearly a million people to compile the information. The diseases not officially caused by smoking were more likely to kill current smokers than nonsmokers: breast cancer was 30 % more likely to kill female smokers; prostate cancer was 40 % more likely to kill male smokers; smokers were twice as likely to die of infections, hypertension, and certain digestive diseases than nonsmokers — and they were as much as 3.6 times more likely to die of cirrhosis. The comparisons go on, and in some cases, a smoker's risk was even greater the more cigarettes he or she smoked per day. Why? the study didn't actually establish a cause-and-effect relationship, the new york times notes, but researchers offer explanations: in the case of infections, possibly because smoking hampers the immune system. For intestinal or digestive illnesses, possibly because smoking reduces blood flow to the intestines. The good news? if you quit, the higher risks fade the longer you stay away from cigarettes, reuters reports. ( if you do quit, you may have trouble finding \" magic \" lozenges. )",

Critics of the chicago-based chain — which produces the traditional hawaiian dish of seasoned raw fish over rice — say that its 2016 trademark of the phrase \" aloha poke \" and its efforts to defend that trademark amount to cultural appropriation and bullying, the guardian reports. The situation came to light recently when lei's poke stop ( formerly aloha poke stop ), which is located in alaska and run by a hawaiian family, announced on facebook that it had changed its name, per eater. After getting a cease and desist order from an aloha poke co lawyer in may, the eatery decided to comply because, says one of the owners, \" we cannot financially afford to go up against those guys. \" other poke restaurants have received similar letters, according to the guardian — including aloha poke shop in honolulu. Co-owner jeff samson says he's decided to ignore the demands. He says he once considered trademarking his shop's name but decided against it, saying: \" how could you trademark aloha? how could you trademark poke? \" but, like lei's poke stop, other shops have changed their names to avoid the expense of a legal battle. These may be pyrrhic victories for aloha poke co, however, as critics take aim at the company on yelp and call for a boycott; a viral video and petition also call attention to the issue. In a lengthy facebook post, the company claims the campaign against it is based on \" misinformation \" and says that people are free to use \" aloha \" and \" poke, \" they just can't combine them in a restaurant name.",

An audience member — who just so happened to be judith williams, google's global diversity manager who leads the company's unconscious bias program — then asked this: \" given that unconscious bias research tells us that women are interrupted a lot more than men, i ' m wondering if you are aware that you have interrupted megan many more times? \" cue the applause. Mashable points out that isaacson also interrupted smith, and that interjections aren't an unusual occurrence at such panels. \" schmidt didn't respond to the questioner, \" states the journal simply.

Researchers from carnegie science, university of california irvine, and the nonprofit organization near zero spoke to dozens of top atmospheric scientists and found that 76 out of 77 had seen no evidence whatsoever of any secret chemical spraying, mashable reports. A 77th reported encountering high levels of atmospheric barium in a remote area with standard ' low'soil barium. According to the study, which was published in environmental research letters. The researchers say the trails left by aircraft are ordinary condensation trails — contrails — though those trails may be lasting longer than they used to because of climate change, and there are more of them than there used to be because of the growth of air travel. They say they carried out the study to have something on the record to refute the \" chemtrails \" theories that one survey found were believed by more than 15 % of americans. \" i felt it was important to definitively show what real experts in contrails and aerosols think, \" researcher ken calderia from carnegie science says in a press release. \" we might not convince die-hard believers that their beloved secret spraying program is just a paranoid fantasy, but hopefully their friends will accept the facts. \"",

And it appears that somebody tried to make sure her body sank to the ocean bottom and stayed there. Police say the torso had been deliberately attached to metal. Worse: \"damage seems to have been done to the torso in an attempt to ensure that air and gases escape and the body won't drift to the surface, \" says a police official, per the guardian. The 30-year-old had been missing since getting on a submarine built by inventor peter madsen on aug. 10. Madsen's story keeps changing: he initially told police he had dropped her off safe and sound, then said he had buried her at sea after she died aboard the sub in an accident. Police have charged him with manslaughter, suggesting that he killed wall during their trip, then deliberately sank his own sub in an attempt to hide the evidence. It has since been refloated, and investigators found blood inside. Madsen's attorney says the torso's identification doesn't change his client's story, that she died in an accident and he disposed of her body ( her head, arms, and legs were cut off ) as best he could. Police used dna samples from wall's hairbrush and toothbrush to identify the torso. The case has now become \"the most spectacular murder case in danish history, \" in the words of christian jensen, editor of denmark's largest daily, politiken, per the new york times.",

        "summary": "The arrival of plants on earth changed the planet and its inhabitants in big ways, and a new study suggests they arrived far earlier than thought. University of bristol researchers now say that land plants evolved from pond scum about 500 million years ago — a whopping 100 million years earlier than the history books tell us, per a release. The date we've long used is based on the fossil record, but fossils aren't so great when it comes to plants because they are far less likely to be preserved than, say, an animal with bones. Hoping to find the answer outside of the fossil record, study co-author mark puttick and a team of researchers looked for differences in the dna of more than 100 plant and algal species to see when they diverged on the evolutionary scale, reports science. The study dates the first land plants to 500 million years ago in the middle cambrian period, which also saw the first appearance of terrestrial animals, who would have enjoyed protection, additional oxygen, and a cooler planet as a result of the plants, researchers say. Their research, published in pnas, \" changes the entire timeline for the origin of terrestrial life and the subsequent pace of evolutionary change in plants and associated animal ( and fungal ) groups, \" plant biologist pamela soltis, who was not involved in the study, tells science. There's still some debate over which plants came first, but the bbc reports they were similar to moss. According to researcher philip donoghue, they \" would have tickled your toes but not reached much higher. \" ( behold the \" holy grail \" of plant breeding. )",

The american college of obstetricians and gynecologists recommends at least 20 to 30 minutes of \" moderate-intensity \" exercise — that means you can hold a conversation at the same time — per day, npr reports. But most pregnant women aren't getting that. That's because, as the washington post reports, old advice for pregnant women — get lots of rest and \" eat for two \" — dies hard. Exercise can help pregnant women avoid gaining too much weight, which may contribute to everything from increased likelihood of cesarean section and bigger-than-average babies to maternal hypertension and breathing problems in the baby. Nearly 50 % of pregnant women gain more weight during pregnancy than recommended by medical experts. Meanwhile, an analysis of more than 2,500 pregnant women who exercised found no risk of low-birth weight or too-early birth. But pregnant women with any sort of health complications should consult with their doctor. ( a new risk for babies born to overweight moms. )",

It seems taylor actually wrote \" this is what you came for \" for calvin, recorded a demo for him to check out, then recorded a full demo with him in a studio ( in which she did the vocals ). They made a joint decision not to publicly credit taylor because news that they collaborated on the song while dating would dominate instead of letting the song itself get all the attention, so taylor kept the publishing rights but used a pseudonym ( nils sjoberg ) on the song's credits. Then, sources say, calvin made a mistake. He recorded the song with rihanna and released it at the end of april, and it was a massive success. But on the day of its release, while being interviewed on ryan seacrest's radio show, calvin was asked if he would ever collaborate with taylor. His response: \" you know, we haven't even spoken about it. I can't see it happening, though. \" sources say taylor thought calvin had taken their decision to keep the news quiet too far, and her feelings were hurt. They say the couple never recovered, and just a few days later, taylor danced with tom hiddleston at the met gala.

One soldier was killed during an hours-long firefight with the militants. The attack left part of the base in flames and the area is still being combed for attackers, reuters reports.

The $ 20-a-month service, which was announced yesterday at ces and is set to debut later this month, will also offer 11 other popular cable networks, including cnn, food network, and the disney channel, the new york times reports. The move is designed to retain cable subscribers getting fed up with rising bills, as well as to draw in a younger demographic that never tapped into cable in the first place. \" we are not hitting the 18- to 35-year-old market today; we just aren't, \" dish ceo joseph clayton tells the times. Sling tv joins other subscription services like hulu, netflix, and amazon — all competition for the old-school tv model, which racks up $ 170 billion a year, the times notes; hbo, showtime, and cbs are also setting up their own subscription streaming services. Not that there aren't pitfalls to the new dish offering, as peter kafka points out on re/code: sling tv needs to be purchased separately for each device; the service isn't directly available on apple tv; and you won't get local news or major broadcast networks like abc or fox. And because of verizon's exclusive mobile deal to stream nfl games, those won't be viewable on mobile devices. Kafka also wonders how long dish can stay profitable at $ 20 a month and how capable the company is of keeping up high-quality streaming. ( cable behemoths like comcast and time warner may have to rethink their pricey tv packages. )",

Out of the 12 multiple-choice questions that pew describes as representing a \" small slice of scientific knowledge, \" the 3,278 randomly selected adults found one on the earth's layers the easiest, with 86 % correctly naming the core as the hottest.

The average number of questions answered correctly was eight, though this tended to go up with the respondent's education level. Pew says that men tended to get higher scores than women, white people tended to score higher than other groups, and younger adults tended to do better than those over 65 — but while under-30s were more likely to identify radio waves as the waves that transmit cellphone calls, fewer of the under-65s were able to identify jonas salk as the developer of the polio vaccine.

No charges have been filed against walker or any member of his staff. The documents were filed in december as part of an investigation into alleged illegal fundraising and campaign coordination by walker and his campaign, the wisconsin club for growth, the state chamber of commerce, and other groups. The investigation began in 2012 as walker, who rose to fame by passing a bill that effectively ended collective bargaining for most public workers, was facing a recall election. But the probe has been on hold since may, when a federal judge ruled it was a breach of wisconsin club for growth's free-speech rights and temporarily halted it. State prosecutors said in the december filing that walker, former chief of staff keith gilkes, top adviser rj johnson, and campaign operative deborah jordahl were discussing illegal fundraising and coordination with national political groups and prominent republican figures, including gop strategist karl rove. At new york, jonathan chait translates thusly: \" the walker allegations center around a widespread legal fiction governing independent expenditures. Donations to candidates can be regulated, but campaign finance laws have opened up a vast loophole for outside groups to spend money on elections, as long as they pretend they're not actually part of the campaign. Walker apparently forgot to pretend. \" it's anybody's guess whether this will turn into an actual indictment, but politico sees it as unwelcome political news for the governor, who is in a tight race for re-election and is mentioned as a 2016 presidential candidate.",

Lohan aired the sentiment shortly after news broke that bynes — whose license is suspended — was pulled over yet again yesterday. Her car, at least, got impounded this time, e! reports. Prior to that, bynes was photographed driving thursday night with her face covered, which is probably about as safe as it sounds. But she insists she's fine and totally not crazy, tmz reports.

No government statistics on sterilization are available, but a social worker tells reuters she sees up to five women a day who seek to undergo a tubal ligation. One health program's 40-slot \" sterilization days \" historically wasn't at capacity; now the waiting list is 500-strong. The skyrocketing cost of hard-to-find contraceptives is at the root. In a march report on the country's severe food shortages, vice explains that there are \" two prices for everything \" in the country: the government price ( which requires hours of waiting in line, and no guarantee it ' ll be in stock ) and the black market price, which is often 10 times higher. Bloomberg reported contraceptives started getting tough to find in december 2014. Vice's reporter went to a dozen pharmacies and found no condoms; women tell reuters birth control pills are similarly absent, even on the black market. Reuters reports that when a pharmacy has a 3-pack of condoms in stock, it costs roughly 600 bolivars; the current monthly minimum wage ( a combination of money and a food ticket ) is about 33,000 bolivars. For ordinary venezuelans, those prices are out of reach, and with abortion illegal except to save a mother's life, there are few options. A 38-year-old mother tells reuters that a pregnancy announcement used to be joyous news. \" now when a woman says ' i ' m pregnant ', everyone scolds you. It makes me sad for young women. \" ( the fastest-growing birth control method isn't the pill. )",

The story begins in 2010, when clark was arrested on charges of attempting to bust her child's father out of jail, per raw story.

She makes clear to him that \" when i told you i am justice — i meant it, \" though mediaite notes she may have taken her patriotic vigilantism too far with the very last word of her missive: \" die. \" ( read clark's entire complaint. )",

        "summary": "New developments in the wells fargo sales scheme emerged monday, with an investigative report from the bank's board noting that $ 75 million in compensation will be clawed back from two former executives, including ex-ceo john stumpf, the new york times reports. After a six-month probe into the scandal that resulted in thousands of bank employees creating accounts without customers ' go-ahead, stumpf will give up $ 28 million that was paid out in 2016 under a 2013 equity grant, which is in addition to a previous $ 41 million and 2016 bonus that he forfeited, usa today reports. Meanwhile, former head of community banking carrie tolstedt, who resigned last june, will have $ 47.3 million in stock options pulled back, which piles onto the $ 19 million in compensation she'd already lost. The 113-page report put together by the shearman &amp; sterling law firm found that due to a lack of any real central authority, executives like tolstedt were given general autonomy to carry out the bank's sales tactics as they saw fit. Tolstedt in particular was found to have been behind much of what the times calls the \" pressure-cooker climate \" at wells fargo, where some employees said they suffered health issues from \" unreasonable \" sales goals resulting in \" negative outcomes and improper behavior, \" per the report; one ex-banker said she even started drinking hand sanitizer to alleviate stress, a 2016 new york times article revealed. Stumpf was reportedly warned repeatedly things were amiss with the company's sales, but he apparently didn't heed the warnings. \" we accept the board's findings as a critical part of our journey to rebuild trust, \" wells fargo ceo tim sloan said in a statement.",

Jewish groups immediately took offense to the anti-semitic connotations, and biden today apologized for his \" poor choice of words, \" reports the hill. The gaffe took place yesterday as the vp spoke to the legal services corp.

Foxman called biden a \" stalwart against anti-semitism \" and praised him for the quick mea culpa",

            "The international jury of the 56th annual world press photo contest has selected a picture by paul hansen of the swedish daily dagens nyheter as the world press photo of the year 2012. The picture shows a group of men carrying the bodies of two dead children through a street in gaza city. They are being taken to a mosque for the burial ceremony while their father's body is carried behind on a stretcher. Two-year-old suhaib hijazi and his older brother muhammad were killed when their house was destroyed by an israeli missile strike. Their mother was put in intensive care. The picture was made on 20 november 2012 in gaza city, palestinian territories. The jury gave prizes in nine themed categories to 54 photographers of 33 nationalities from: argentina, australia, belgium, brazil, canada, chile, china, czech republic, denmark, france, germany, india, indonesia, iran, italy, jordan, malaysia, mexico, palestinian territories, the netherlands, peru, poland, portugal, russia, serbia, south africa, spain, sweden, switzerland, turkey, united kingdom, usa, and vietnam. The members of the jury announced the winners at a press conference held at the world press photo office in amsterdam on 15 february. Comments on the winners by the jury mayu mohanna, jury member from peru, said of paul hansen's winning picture: \"the strength of the pictures lies in the way it contrasts the anger and sorrow of the adults with the innocence of the children. It's a picture i will not forget. \" santiago lyon, vice president and director of photography at the associated press, spoke of the selection of prizewinners: \"when i look at the results, as chair of the jury, i think that the world press photo of the year, and all the other photos that were given prizes, were solid, stellar examples of first-rate photojournalism that is powerful, that is lasting, and that will reach whoever looks at them. \" the judging was conducted at the world press photo office in amsterdam. All entries were anonymously presented to the jury, who discussed their merits"

        "summary": "Stem cell transplants have helped dozens of people blinded by chemical burns to see again, italian researchers say. Doctors used stem cells from undamaged parts of the patients ' eyes to replace the damaged cornea. The procedure resulted in a successful transplant roughly 75 % of the time. One man who badly damaged both his eyes 60 years ago now has near-normal vision after undergoing the procedure, the ap reports. The procedure — which requires patients to have at least some healthy eye tissue remaining — is still experimental and is not being performed in the us. Earlier attempts at the same procedure achieved only short-lived results, but the italian researchers say they managed to restore vision in patients for a decade or more. The study shows the vast promise regenerative stem cell treatment holds not just for blindness, but for damaged hearts, livers, and bladders, an ophthalmology professor tells webmd.",

Peachtree city police chief william mccollom called 911 around 4: 15 a.m. And reported shooting his wife, margaret, inside the couple's bedroom, peachtree city police lt. Mark brown said. Mccollom's wife was flown to atlanta medical center. She was in critical condition, hospital spokeswoman nicole gustin said. Investigators would not discuss what led mccollom to open fire. Local police turned the criminal probe over to the georgia bureau of investigation and the local prosecutor's office. Gbi spokeswoman sherry lang said initial reports suggested that mccollom shot his wife twice, but later information revealed she was shot once. Authorities said the police chief fired his department-issued firearm, a 9-mm glock handgun. \" he is fully cooperating at this point, and he has been interviewed, \" said lang, who refused to comment on what mccollom told investigators. The victim had not spoken police by early thursday afternoon. It appeared there were no other witnesses to the shooting. Lang said gbi investigators believe mccollom and his wife were alone. Mccollom has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation and an internal review. He has not been charged with any crimes, said scott ballard, district attorney for the griffin judicial circuit. \" there are a lot of things that we don't know yet about what took place that we need to know before we can make any decisions, \" ballard said.

The washington post reports that stratolaunch, shaping up to be the world's largest airplane, is now 76 % assembled — no small accomplishment given the sheer size of the beast, a twin-fuselage behemoth expected to weigh ( payload included ) 1.3 million pounds, be powered by six 747 engines, boast landing gear with 28 wheels, and house 60 miles of wiring, among other feats. But to what end? well, to shuttle rockets up to 35,000 feet and launch them into low earth orbit. Oh, and to do this by the end of this decade. That's right: someday it may actually be routine to transport people and objects in the couple-hundred-miles-above-earth section of space, and allen is willing to bet big on it. \" when such access to space is routine, innovation will accelerate in ways beyond what we can currently imagine, \" he says in a statement. Geekwire says walking into the hangar at the mojave air and space port \" feels as if you're stepping into the starship enterprise's construction zone. \" no wonder, given the plane's 385-foot wing, which would put the aircraft on par with the fictional spaceship. Allen isn't saying how many millions he's put into it so far, but his head of operations says this isn't just a big plane, but a big idea — and not a billionaire's \" vanity project. \" the los angeles times, meanwhile, rounds up some of the other big, or just simply bizarre, aircraft built in southern california over the years, including howard hughes'spruce goose seaplane.

Big difference. \" predictably, he responded with a link to a picture of what he thinks momsen really needs: a fist-shaped sex toy.

Nasa says astronauts are \" in no danger, \" but the situation could affect the station's power capabilities. Crew members spotted the frozen ammonia leaking from from a coolant loop yesterday. A similar leak was observed in 2007, but a spacewalk last year was believed to have fixed it. The new leak \" is in the same area, but we don't know whether it's the same leak, \" says a nasa rep. Experts are still trying to figure out the exact location of the leak. In the meantime, commander chris hadfield has offered a somewhat reassuring tweet, picked up by the atlantic wire: \" it is a serious situation, but between crew and experts on the ground, it appears to have been stabilized. Tomorrow we find out for certain. \"",

Image taken: feb. 10, 2010. Astronauts on the international space station have discovered a leak of ammonia coolant on their orbiting habitat, and nasa is looking into the problem, though it poses no immediate danger to the crew, officials said today ( may 9 ). The space station uses chilled liquid ammonia to cool down the power systems on its eight giant solar array panels. A minor leak of this ammonia was first noticed in 2007, and nasa has been studying the issue ever since. In november 2012 two astronauts took a spacewalk to fix the problem, rewiring some coolant lines and installing a spare radiator due to fears the original radiator was damaged by a micrometeorite impact. At the time, those measures appeared to fix the problem, but today astronauts on the football field-size space station noticed a steady stream of frozen ammonia flakes leaking from the area of the suspect coolant loop in the photovoltaic thermal control system ( pvtcs ).

The astronauts on board the iss had noticed what they believe to be ammonium cooling fluid leaking from the hull. The fluid is used to cool the power systems that control the space station's eight solar array panels, meaning that a total failure would cripple the floating habitat's ability to generate power.

        "summary": "A $ 500,000 search operation will once again scour the pacific island of nikumaroro next month for signs of amelia earhart's plane. But if you ask dick spink, they're looking in the wrong place. Spink, a high school teacher from washington state, has spent $ 50,000 searching for earhart's final landing spot on mili atoll in the marshall islands. National geographic shares the casual origins of spink's quest: while dining with marshallese friends three years ago, spink mentioned earhart's july 1937 disappearance. \" she landed on our island, and my uncle watched her for two days, \" was the response he got. Intrigued, spink kept asking others questions. \" i heard a consistent story from too many people in the marshalls to dismiss it, \" he says. \" i feel like the key to the earhart mystery has just been handed to me. \" the marshall islands theory is a decades-old one: one version of the story goes that earhart and navigator fred noonan, low on gas and unable to make it to howland island to refuel, landed at the atoll and were taken prisoner by the japanese. Skeptics say radio transmissions indicate earhart got close to howland — which would have been a good four-hour flight from mili atoll. But spink thinks he has proof. A january press release explains the explorer found \" a small aluminum cover plate and a circular metal dust cover from a landing-gear wheel assembly \" on the atoll's reefs. The skagit valley herald reported that airplane mechanic jim hayton ided the dust cover as a perfect fit for the lockheed 10's left-hand goodyear air wheel. \" how many lockheed 10s would have crash-landed on that beach on a little island? just one, \" said hayton. National geographic reports scientists from alcoa, the plane's aluminum supplier, are now comparing those and other pieces to a piece that was removed from her plane during an early 1937 repair in california. They hope to soon determine if the metal is a match.",

According to the bbc, the zoo had come under fire in recent years over the condition of its animals and infrastructure. Of particular concern was the suffering of the zoo's polar bears during buenos aires'sweltering summers. The zoo's last remaining polar bear, winner, died in part because of hot temperatures and poor conditions. And while the zoo was originally built on the edge of buenos aires, the city had grown around it, putting animals in close proximity to buildings and busy streets, the ap reports. \"this situation of captivity is degrading for the animals, it's not the way to take care of them, \" buenos aires mayor horacio rodríguez larreta said during a ceremony thursday, per the guardian. Most of the zoo's animals — sources have them numbering between 1,500 and 2,500 — will be moved to animal sanctuaries in argentina and elsewhere. About 50 animals too old or sick to move will stay behind, though not on public display. Among those animals is sandra the orangutan, who made news two years ago when a court gave her rights as a \" non-human person. \" the 44-acre zoo will be transformed into an ecological park that will promote conservation and rehabilitate animals rescued from illegal trafficking.",

For instance, a mother's risk of obesity, breast and ovarian cancer, and osteoporosis go down if she nursed, reports the independent. But now researchers report in the journal of the american heart association that breastfeeding positively impacts heart health years down the road, too. Analyzing data from nearly 300,000 women ages 30 to 79 in china, 99 % of whom had given birth and 97 % of whom had breastfed, they found that after 8 years of study, breastfeeding mothers had a 9 % lower risk of heart disease and an 8 % lower risk of stroke when compared to their non-breastfeeding counterparts. Those figures grew the longer a women nursed her child. The researchers calculated that each additional six months of breastfeeding reduces a woman's risk of cardiovascular disease by 4 percentage points, with mothers who breastfeed their babies for two or more years enjoying a nearly 20 % reduced risk compared to mothers who never did. In a press release, study co-author sanna peters speculates that because a woman's metabolism changes dramatically after giving birth to store fat for milk, breastfeeding could help run through that stored fat \" faster and more completely. \" cdc stats show only about 31 % of us babies are still being breast-fed at one year.

Amounts for heirs of camp survivors who have since died are to be determined on the basis of the number of years those survivors lived after their liberation. Eligible claimants can choose annuities rather than lump sums. The agreement closes a loophole that has prevented some citizens of the united states and a number of other countries from receiving french compensation. The agreement also is intended to close the door on pending state and federal legislation that would ban france's state-owned sncf railway or its foreign subsidiaries from winning contracts in the united"

        "summary": "Us officials ( though unnamed ones ) have for the first time owned up to tapping the phones of 35 world leaders — an admission made in the course of issuing a denial: they tell the wall street journal that president obama had no knowledge of that monitoring until after the edward snowden leaks this year. Further, those leaks led obama to request a review of surveillance activities; he ultimately ordered an end to the snooping on some — but not all — of the leaders after that summertime review, according to the officials. The journal doesn't know which leaders remain on the list, though it notes that angela merkel is definitely not being monitored, and that those who are still under surveillance have not been removed because they are providing useful intelligence. More on the subject: merkel's conversations still could be occasionally overheard, though, point out the officials. That's because leaders who have been crossed off the nsa's list communicate with ones who remain on it. Officials say obama was briefed on intelligence-gathering \" priorities \" but wasn't involved in choosing targets. \" these decisions are made at nsa, \" one official says. \" the president doesn't sign off on this stuff. \" that arrangement is now under review, however. The white house says it won't \" comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity, \" but the nsa issued a statement yesterday to deny a report that obama had been briefed on the surveillance of merkel back in 2010, reports the guardian. A database entry in the snowden documents suggests the surveillance began in 2002, well before she became chancellor. But german-american woes may be far from over: der spiegel claims that a spy outfit tied to the cia and nsa has set up an illicit \" listening station \" atop the roof of the us embassy in berlin. Relying on documents leaked by snowden, it reports that the \" special collection service \" operates devices that can intercept everything from cell signals to satellite communications, and der spiegel believes those devices are possibly in operation behind \" window-like indentations on the [ embassy's ] roof... Veneered with'dielectric ' material and are painted to blend into the surrounding masonry. \" the nsa had no comment. Cue spanish outrage: el mundo today claims that the nsa tracked more than 60 million phone calls in the country between december 2012 and january 2013. More on that story here.",

Bristles coming loose from barbecue brushes, then finding their way from grill to food to throat is getting to be such an issue that the canadian society of otolaryngology addressed it at its annual meeting this year. \" none of us have figured out a surefire way to get rid of them, so we'd prefer just to prevent it from happening in the first place, \" munchies quotes one otolaryngologist as saying. While surgeons in canada are recommending no one use barbecue brushes with wire bristles, it's also a problem here in the us.

Why would a person subject himself to such a thing? for charity: carey, who works on relevant magazine's podcast, is using what he calls his \" ultimate test of endurance \" to raise money for charity: water.

Why nickelback? \" i ' m willing to put my personal health at risk for the challenge, \" carey writes on the campaign page. \" such an endeavor could result in irreversible damage to my ears, brain, kidneys, and soul. \" on his twitter account, he's been letting readers in on the miserable experience: \" it's been less than 12 hours, and i've already hit rock bottom. \" \" when i want to giving up the nbchallenge, i think of living in a world where nickelback is more powerful than the human spirit &amp; i press on \" \" night 3 of the nickelback challenge done. It's almost like half of the songs were written with the intention of preventing you from sleeping \" he's also posted youtube video updates, one of which, of course, features nickelback playing prominently in the background. In the second, he's listening on earbuds so no one else is \" exposed \" to the \" toxic \" substance. Before the challenge started, carey talked about it on a relevant podcast. \" i want someone who's going through a hard time next week to be like, ' huh, i ' m really down and out, life's really got me down, but right now there's a guy who's been listening to nickelback for days straight, ' \" he said.

            "By daniel indiviglio the letter that republican leaders sent to the central bank is nothing to worry about politicians like to exert their influence on issues they care about. If you find this shocking, then you might be appalled to hear that congressional republican leaders sent a letter to federal reserve chairman ben bernanke on monday urging restraint on additional monetary stimulus. Anyone who finds this action unprecedented must not follow politics very closely. In fact, both sides of the aisle do what they can to try to shape fed policy. But luckily, this political reality is nothing to worry about. What the gop wants the gist of the letter can be understood through its first paragraph",

Action is likely to come in the form of shifting funds into longer-term holdings, with the intention of lowering treasury yields and reducing rates on mortgages and other loans. Industry insiders apparently call it \"operation twist. \" but while we wait for word from the fed, congressional republicans aren't just sitting around — they're actively lobbying bernanke, pressing him to let the economy stay on its downward trajectory and to not even try to help. Even though the financial markets have been counting on the federal reserve to take",

Former city clerk tyrus byrd was sworn in as mayor last week, after beating 37-year incumbent randall ramsey by a 38 votes, 122-84. But byrd is without a clerk, city attorney, or water treatment supervisor, who promptly walked off the job; five of parma's six cops did as well, claiming \" safety concerns. \" byrd has no comment on the walkouts, but says she hasn't been able to find resignation letters reportedly left behind, the daily news reports. On the bright side, byrd says she's getting assistance from residents and other communities to help keep the town on track, wsmv reports. And parma residents are weighing in: \" i think it's pretty dirty they all quit without giving her a chance, \" says martha miller, a white resident. \" but i don't think they hurt the town any by quitting, because who needs six police for 740 people. \" black resident terrell thatch sees it a little differently: \" they say we have six cops on the payroll, \" he says. \" how can we have six cops, and go days without cops patrolling? you know, and we've got these recent break-ins. \" according to wikipedia, the 2010 census found parma to be about 67 % white, 29 % black, and 2.8 % latino.

A spokesman for the coast guard, which sent at least three aircraft to search for broberg, tells the star-telegram that her companions didn't realize she was missing until noon on friday, and the coast guard wasn't contacted until 5pm that day, after the cruise line had searched the ship and reviewed its surveillance footage.",

The latest: the news: kurdish fighters battling isis in northern syria say the airstrikes aimed at the militants there haven't done much to stop the group's advance on kobani. Kurds put isis ' position as within roughly a mile of the center of the city, which sits along the turkish border. A rep for the kurds explains to the guardian that upon the approach of a jet, the fighters \" scatter and hide.... Fighter jets simply cannot hit each and every isis fighter on the ground. \" though the pentagon shares no specifics about strike locations, the syrian observatory for human rights reports that the areas around kobani have been continually hit in recent days. The significance: the guardian sees the kurds ' assertion as one that will \" unsettle those in the us-led coalition... Who have signed up to an air war as the best way of taking the fight to isis. \" as for why kobani matters, it falls within the stretch of land that isis seeks to claim between its \" capital \" of raqqa and the border with turkey, notes cnn. The news: the new york times today reports on what isis fighters are using to wage their battle: ammunition from america and other enemy nations of isis. The finding comes from conflict armament research's analysis of 1,730 cartridges found in syria and iraq — either sized by kurdish fighters or gathered by car investigators. In the former country, most of the seized cartridges were manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s, most commonly in china. The cartridges found in iraq were mostly of us origin, and manufactured in the 2000s. More than 80 % of the ammunition was made in the us, china, post-soviet russia, and serbia. The significance: per the times, the data \" carries an implicit warning for policy makers and advocates of intervention.
