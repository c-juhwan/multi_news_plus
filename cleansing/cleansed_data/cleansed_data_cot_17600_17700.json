        "summary": "The louvre and the musee d ' orsay closed their doors to the public thursday as the seine crept up past its normal water levels, prompting fears of flooding and peril to famous works in both paris art institutions, the independent reports. Local cops say that flood warnings for areas along the river's banks have moved on to \" orange \" alert, the second-highest in the color-coded system, designating the rising water as having the potential to make a \" significant impact \" on buildings and people, per the ap. The louvre, which the local says had earlier pooh-poohed the possibility of flooding, has decided to stay closed all day friday so workers can lug precious artwork from lower levels to higher ones, though the museum's signature piece, leonardo da vinci's mona lisa, is on a high-enough floor to sit tight as-is. Heavy rains have led to floods all over france this week, as well as in germany and belgium, leading to stranded drivers, mass evacuations, and the deaths of at least half a dozen people so far. The last \" catastrophic \" flood in paris, per the independent, was in 1910, when the seine rose to nearly 28 feet, flooding parts of the city for more than a month; the head of the agency that measures the river's levels says he expects the river levels to peak at closer to 20 feet overnight. Luckily, both museums have been prepping for a moment like this for some time, holding flood drills that test response time — the louvre's staff managed to clear out its entire subterranean islamic art section in just a day earlier this year during one such dry run. Cnn notes that rain is expected to continue over the weekend. ( will these downpours bring out more louvre rats? )",

        "summary": "For the second time in two months, shots have been fired during a north korean soldier's defection across the dmz — and this time, it was south koreans doing the shooting. The south korean military says the \" low ranking \" soldier was manning a guard post before he walked across the dmz in thick fog early thursday, emerging at a checkpoint, the new york times reports. The military says that south korean soldiers fired around 20 warning shots when a north korean search party approached the border. Gunfire was heard from the north around 40 minutes later, though no shots are believed to have crossed the border, the bbc reports. Last month, another defector was shot five times by his fellow soldiers. A south korean military spokesman says fog limited visibility at the checkpoint on the center-western frontline to around 100 yards, but the defecting soldier was detected by surveillance equipment before he reached the border. The spokesman said the soldier, the fourth to defect this year, is now \" safely secure. \" he said the north korean would be questioned to determine his background and his reasons for making the rare and dangerous crossing. Reuters reports that south korean authorities say two more defectors from the north, civilians in a fishing boat, also arrived in the south on thursday. There has been no comment from pyongyang on either incident. ( china is reportedly preparing refugee camps in case large numbers of north koreans flee across the border. )",

South korean soldiers later fired 20 warning shots at north korean border guards who were searching for the defector, which was followed 40 minutes later by gunfire in the north, the joint chiefs of staff said. More than 30,000 north koreans have fled to south korea since a famine killed at least a million people in the north in the 1990s. The country has recently been the subject of a tightening grip of sanctions that have curbed exports that provide urgently needed revenue, and it has been struggling with the impact of a drought that has reduced agricultural yields. But it is extremely rare for people to flee across the demilitarized zone. The 2.5-mile-wide dmz, considered the most heavily fortified border in the world, is guarded by minefields, sentry posts and tall fences topped with barbed wire, some electrified. The soldier's defection to south korea on thursday was the fourth this year, and the gunfire over the episode is certain to raise tensions on the korean peninsula just as hopes have grown for a thaw in relations between the south and north.

            "Seoul ( reuters ) - south korean guards fired warning shots across the heavily militarized border with north korea on thursday as a soldier from the north defected in thick fog, complicating efforts to ease tensions over pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. A south korean defense ministry official said up to 20 warning shots were fired as north korean troops approached too near the \"military demarcation line \" at the demilitarized zone ( dmz ), apparently in search of the missing soldier. Thursday's defection came about five weeks after a north korean soldier suffered critical gunshot wounds during a defection dash across the border. Two north korean civilians were also found in a fishing boat on wednesday and had sought to defect, officials in the south said. That brings the total number of north koreans who have defected by taking dangerous routes either directly across the border or by sea to 15 so far this year, including two other soldiers. That is three times the number last year, according to south korean officials. Tensions on the korean peninsula were already high after reclusive, impoverished north korea accelerated testing of its missile and nuclear programs this year in defiance of international pressure and un sanctions. The defections also threaten to complicate south korea's efforts to ensure the smooth running of the 2018 winter olympics, which begin in pyeongchang in february."

Credit: nasa view full size image another bout of painfully cold arctic air is on its way to the northern united states, reviving talk of what has become popularly known as the \" polar vortex. \" by thursday, temperatures will have dropped to as low as 30 degrees fahrenheit ( 17 degrees celsius ) below the average temperature for this time of the year, meteorologists say, with highs dipping down into the teens in new york city and into the single digits in chicago. Average temperatures for this time of year in those regions are generally closer to 45 and 40 f ( 7.2 and 4.4 c ), respectively, said bernie rayno, a meteorologist with accuweather.

Citing two similar, though not lethal, incidents of distracted pedestrians hit by quiet electric street trains, the town has installed traffic lights in the ground to catch the attention of those looking down at their phones when a tram is approaching. The lights began operating at two tram stops last week, reports the local. \" the normal traffic light isn't in the line of sight of many pedestrians these days, \" tobias harms of city administration tells the german-language augsburger allgemeine, per the local. \" the more we have, the more people are likely to notice them. \" the utility company that installed the lights says they rapidly blink red whenever the pedestrian doesn't have the right of way, reports atlas obscura. And while germany is the home of the popular word \" smombie, \" meaning smartphone zombie, the phenomenon is clearly a global problem, reports the washington post. The university of washington estimates that one in three americans is buried in a smartphone at dangerous road crossings, while in 2014 the chinese city of chongqing installed a 165-foot stretch of pavement where pedestrians had to actively choose between a normal lane and the smombie one. But are the lights working? \" until now, i didn't even notice them, \" says one pedestrian. ( experts say these are dark days for pedestrian safety. )",

Days later, shelter operator southwest key programs contacted her father, who lives in calfornia, saying a boy had fondled dl but it wouldn't happen again. A shelter document appears to confirm the june 4 assault, saying dl was told to \" maintain my distance from the other youth involved \" and had received \" psychoeducation \" about abuse and \" good touch bad touch. \" signed only by \" d, \" the form says it's her \" responsibility to follow the safety plan. \" on june 22, southwest key contacted dl's father again and said the same boy had again fondled and hit his daughter. Asked how that could happen, the caller said she couldn't go into details; the shelter operator said less when contacted by the nation. A nonprofit out of austin, texas, southwest key is contracted by the feds ( this year's expected contract: $ 458 million ) to run 26 housing facilities for immigrant minors, per texas monthly. An aclu report earlier this year found hundreds of immigrant-children abuse cases in us custody between 2009 and 2014, but customs and border protection called the report \" unfounded and baseless. \" dl, now reunited with her mom and dad, appears traumatized: \" she wouldn't touch me, hug me, or kiss me \" for days, the mom says. \" she behaves like she is programmed. \"",

The case of guadalupe garcia de rayos became a rallying cry thursday for immigrant groups who believe trump's approach to immigration unfairly tears apart families. Her arrest prompted a vocal demonstration in downtown phoenix as protesters blocked enforcement vans from leaving a us immigration office. Seven people were arrested. White house spokesman sean spicer referred questions on the matter to immigration and customs enforcement, which said in a statement on twitter on thursday that the agency \" will remove illegal aliens convicted of felony offenses as ordered by an immigration judge. \" garcia de rayos, 35, came to the us from the mexican state of guanajuato when she was 14 and has two children who are us citizens, per an immigrant advocacy group; the new york times reports she had not been back to mexico since she left. She was among workers arrested years ago in one of then-sheriff joe arpaio's first investigations into phoenix-area businesses suspected of hiring immigrants who had used fraudulent ids to get jobs, and accused of using a social security number belonging to another person to get a job. She pleaded guilty in march 2009 to a reduced charge of criminal impersonation and was sentenced to two years of probation. She was placed into deportation proceedings but given leniency. On wednesday, she showed up with her lawyer for what she thought was a routine check-in with ice officials and was detained instead of being allowed to leave after checking in. She was deported around 10am thursday from a nogales border crossing and ice worked with mexican consular officials to repatriate her, agency spokeswoman yasmeen pitts o ' keefe said in a statement.",

Populations have fallen by 90 percent, but no more than that, and jones believes some of those surviving devils may be acquiring a kind of resistance. Jones ' other source of hope, though tenuous, comes from a population of devils in the north-central part of the state, on the front lines of the cancer's steady westward march. Devils in the west are somewhat genetically distinct from those in the east, where the disease began, and these western devils might be more resistant to the disease. Jones herself is now far too busy orchestrating research projects to spend much time in the field. But her research assistant rodrigo hamede ross has been studying this population since before the disease hit the area in 2006.

        "summary": "With polls suggesting the next president is more likely to be hillary clinton than somebody who claims he can \" make america great again, \" some republican senators are wavering on their supreme court stance. Senate majority leader mitch mcconnell insists that the next president should choose antonin scalia's replacement, but some gop senators are open to confirming merrick garland, president obama's relatively centrist choice, in a lame-duck session after the election, especially if the gop loses both the presidency and the senate, the new york times reports. The times calls the nomination battle a \" rare washington fight that washes over all three branches of government with the prospect of damaging each of them. \" in other coverage: in what democrats say is a sign that pressure is working, some gop senators have already agreed to meet with garland, reports politico, which notes that seven current senate republicans voted to confirm garland to the washington, dc, circuit court in 1997, although mcconnell voted against him. Some groups had hoped for a more liberal choice, or somebody who would make the court more diverse, but democratic senators aren't quibbling with the choice of garland, who is seen as a candidate capable of breaking the gop blockade, reports the washington post. \" most justices are able to time their departure from the court so that someone of similar ilk replaces them, \" says ed whelan, a former gop aide to the senate judiciary committee. \" my guess is the white house decided that rolling the dice, that they had the best chance of getting action on the garland confirmation. \" but mcconnell shows no sign of backing down, the hill reports. A spokesman says the majority leader spoke to garland and told him he will not meet with him or hold a hearing on his nomination. \" the leader reiterated his position that the american people will have a voice in this vacancy and that the senate will appropriately revisit the matter when it considers the qualifications of the person the next president nominates, \" the spokesman says.

He suffered from an ear condition starting at age 17, according to the japan times; by the age of 35, he couldn't hear at all, and claimed to rely on \" absolute pitch \" to compose. \" i had to ask the person to help me for more than half the work, \" samuragochi says. He provided ideas to the fellow composer, who worked them into pieces. \" i've been told that there are certain circumstances that make it hard for the person to come out in public, and samuragochi has come to describe himself as the sole composer, \" his lawyer says, noting that samuragochi is \" deeply sorry. \" according to japanese media, the actual composer is takashi niigaki, who the afp reports released a statement saying he had worked as samuragochi's ghostwriter for 18 years. Samuragochi achieved success with his soundtrack to the video game resident evil; in 2003, he had a major hit with \" hiroshima symphony. \" japanese figure skater daisuke takahashi is due to use a piece credited to samuragochi during the olympics, the bbc reports.",

The two alleged victims, 34 and 36, claim former junior civil service minister george tron, 53, attacked them between 2007 and 2010.

Meanwhile, the weekly standard took a closer look last week at the second woman who accused strauss-kahn of sexual assault. Alleged victim tristane banon, the goddaughter of strauss-kahn's second wife and a close friend of his daughter, was 22 when she says the former imf boss assaulted her in 2002. She says he tried to rape her while she interviewed him for a chapter that she later pulled from her collection of interviews with powerful men. Though banon referred to the incident in her writing and even on a tv program, no one truly listened until now.",

The world's first \" test tube \" rhinos have arrived, hybrid embryos created by fertilizing eggs from southern white rhinos with frozen sperm from northern white males. Those embryos, now themselves frozen for future implantation in southern white rhinos or hybrids, show \" for the first time that modern technology can offer some options for conservation when the situation gets very bad, \" co-author of the study, published in the nature communications, cesare galli tells cnn. Another co-author, jan stejskal, notes that artificial insemination and natural breeding initiatives over the past 20 years had failed to keep the species going. In addition, researchers were able to extract stem cells from southern white rhinos, which can be used to make eggs and sperm to create more embryos; frozen skin cells previously taken from northern white rhinos also exist as potential embryo sources. Sciencenews notes pure northern white rhinos could evolve from the hybrids by diluting the southern white rhino genes via selective breeding, though that would take decades. And it may be some time before we actually see a baby northern white rhino: one scientist involved with the study tells the bbc he hopes to see one born \" within three years, \" but galli notes it will be closer to 10. And a conservation expert tells cnn we shouldn't just rely on ivf to save any species, but be \" working on all fronts, \" including via anti-poaching efforts and forest conservation.

        "summary": "Danielle and alexander meitiv, a climate-science expert and a physicist for the national institutes of health now best known as the \" free-range \" parents who let their two kids walk unsupervised from parks to their house, have been formally declared \" responsible for unsubstantiated child neglect \" by local child protective services. The ruling was one of three possible outcomes in neglect investigations, reports the washington post: ruled out, unsubstantiated, or indicated. Unsubstantiated is something of a middle ground, and will be thrown out in five years if no other reports are filed. But, as the post notes, it leaves the case unresolved. Says danielle meitiv: \" parents try so hard. Even though i know they are wrong, it's a painful judgment.... They really believe we did something wrong. \" \" all of us were hoping sanity would prevail and they would drop it, \" says the founder of empower kids maryland, created in the wake of the meitiv case. It all started last fall, when dvora, 6 and rafi, 10, were seen walking home alone from a playground in silver spring, md., and authorities were called to investigate. The meitivs say that letting their kids gradually venture out on their own nurtures independence, and that the ruling will not change their parenting approach, reports today. In fact, just yesterday, a snow day in maryland, danielle meitiv says she sent her kids outside. \" it's a gorgeous day and i kicked my kids out, because that's what you do on a beautiful day, \" she says. The meitivs add that they plan to appeal the ruling. \" what will happen next time? \" says danielle meitiv. \" we don't know if we will get caught in this kafkaesque loop again. \" ( unsupervised dogs taking the bus, meanwhile, attract much less controversy. )",

A 19-year-old from manchester, england, has legally changed his name rather than pay a $ 336 fee to ryanair, reports the guardian. The tale of how adam armstrong became adam west began when his girlfriend's stepfather booked him a ticket for a family vacation to ibiza. The problem is that he used facebook to get adam's last name, and armstrong was using \" adam west \" there as a jokey homage to the batman tv actor. When armstrong discovered the error on the tickets, ryanair — notorious for its fees — informed him it would cost $ 336 to correct the mistake. Instead of paying the airline, armstrong legally changed his name for free, then paid $ 158 for a new passport. \" yeah, i ' m not giving ryanair a penny, \" he told an irish radio show. The airline explains to business insider that the steep fee is to protect against \" screenscraping, \" in which people buy tickets on the cheap and then resell them at a profit. Armstrong's was double the usual amount because his girlfriend was on the same booking. The story was first reported by the sun, and armstrong says he actually made a profit on the whole ordeal because the tabloid paid him for an interview, reports the daily edge. ( \" good man yourself, \" adds the irish site. ) the teen says his dad wasn't too pleased with the new name idea, but \"i ' m going to change it back in seven years [ when the passport expires ], \" reports the irish independent.

Now a new incident has come to light, and it isn't likely to help the airline's reputation: a christmas day flight from new zealand's auckland airport to kuala lumpur started off its journey flying in the wrong direction, the independent reports. Flight mh132 usually shoots northwest over australia on its way toward the malaysian capital, but this time flightradar24.com shows a path that took the plane south instead. \" the flight plan the airline filed with us was going to kuala lumpur but via a slightly different route than the pilot was expecting, \" says a spokeswoman for airways, the company that manages new zealand's air traffic control. And the pilot was indeed alarmed, noticing the different path just eight minutes into the flight and asking air traffic controllers why the plane was headed that way. \" the pilot [ did ] a very good job by noticing it, querying it and not just blindly flying off and ending up in the southern ocean, \" aviation expert peter clark tells the new zealand herald. Clark explained that while flights headed to kuala lumpur sometimes take a more southern route when there's bad weather or strong headwinds, it appears in this case there was simply an error. A statement posted sunday on the malaysia airlines website notes that \" on december 24th 2015 our flight mh132 from auckland to kuala lumpur was given the latest flight plan by the airline's operations dispatch centre ( odc ) whilst auckland's air traffic control ( atc ) was inadvertently given an earlier flight plan.

I didn't endanger anybody's life. \" that's what texas man brett sanders tells nbc-dfw to explain his indignation over a $ 220-plus speeding ticket he recently received while driving near his frisco home. Sanders was fined for driving 9 miles over the limit, and because cops made such a big deal about his transgression, he decided to make a big deal about paying for it. \" i just decided i may as well pay with pennies and … make a big spectacle of it, \" he says. In a caption for the youtube video he posted about the incident, entitled, \" how to pay a speeding ticket \" ( it's already racked up more than 1 million views ), sanders notes he was convicted for going 39mph in a 30mph zone, that he's \" not a big fan of extortion, \" and that he had to pay the $ 212 ( plus a processing fee ) facing \" the barrel of a gun \" ( which we're assuming is metaphorical ). The video shows sanders unrolling the approximately 22,000 one-cent pieces he retrieved from a local bank and dumping them into two large buckets labeled \" extortion money, \" per today.com. He lugged the buckets to the city's municipal court, where he proceeded to unload his coinage onto a clerk's counter. The new york daily news says it took the clerks three hours to count and roll the pennies back up. \" it felt really great, \" sanders says, per nbc. The kicker to his stunt, which technically isn't illegal, is that he overpaid: the city now owes him a grand total of $ 7.81, though he says he's cool with them holding onto the change. \" i ' m just going to go ahead and let them keep that, \" he notes.

The eight-time emmy winner departed with a golden deal that made him tens of millions of dollars per year. So he gave \" most of it away, \" he once said, to protecting animals, training dogs for the disabled, and getting vegan meals to low-income families. Married twice — once to actor and poker player jennifer tilly — he also hosted a poker-playing show on playboy tv. Born in the la area in 1955, he started off as a tv writer, then went on to run taxi and direct shows including the carlin show, friends, and anger management, says the hollywood reporter.

China has been castigated by the international community for building the world's second-largest — but basically unregulated — transplant industry by harvesting thousands of organs from condemned inmates, including political prisoners, each year. China vowed to stop the practice in 2014 and now, thanks to a decade of effort by huang jiefu, a former deputy health minister in china, and a chicago surgeon, china has a \" transparent \" online registry of voluntary donors and a database that matches recipients, per the post. Huang says the \" game of wealth and power \" of illegal organ allocation is over, though chinese law does not explicitly prevent using the organs of convicted prisoners. Former critics are slowly coming around. The former chief of the transplantation society says he sees a \" substantial change in china \" which is going \" in the right direction. \" but not everyone is convinced. A chinese lawyer says a prisoner facing execution was forced to \" voluntarily \" donate his organs last november, and a report in june 2016 accused china of continuing the practice, per cnn. A us house resolution passed just last year condemned china's \" state-sanctioned \" secret organ harvesting. And in february of this year, huang acknowledged at a vatican summit that illegal organ transplants may still be taking place in a \" big country \" like china, per newsweek. Who advisor dr. Francis delmonico told pbs in may that while death row harvesting is \" markedly reduced \" in china, he could not say for sure it has \" completely stopped. \"",

An exact match for the virus that has sickened 96 people in the middle east, killing almost half of them, was found in a fecal pellet from an egyptian tomb bat near the home of one of the first known victims in saudi arabia, the new york times reports. This is the first time the virus has been found in an animal, but since bats — especially this species, which roosts in abandoned buildings — rarely come into contact with people, researchers believe it may infect other animals, livescience notes. Camels are also suspected to be a source of infection, but samples from the saudi victim's four pet camels haven't been analyzed in the us lab that tested the bat pellet yet because an agriculture department laboratory has to declare them free of foot-and-mouth disease first.",

This year's dip reflected slower stockpiling by businesses, a cutback in business investment and a wider trade deficit. Economists are looking for a strong rebound in the april-june quarter as the country shakes off the effects of a severe winter."

Unlike the splashy video for the song she released a couple weeks ago, this new outing does not feature her androgynous alter ago jo calderone. However, as the daily mail notes, the film's fanciful nymph character did appear alongside calderone in the original video, playing the piano in a field. The black-and-white film, shot by dutch fashion photographers inez van lamsweerde and vinoodh matadin, sees gaga unusually bare-faced, wearing only a simple slip and ballet slippers. During its two-minute running time, the lady displays some graceful dance moves, letting her long, loose locks cascade around her and gently lifting her dress to show off some not-so-subtle tattoos. We rather like seeing gaga au naturel for a change. What do",
            "A few days ago, we saw lady gaga go au naturel for her \" you and i \" fashion-film series, and we liked her fresh-faced new look. Now more images from the shoot by dutch fashion photographers inez van lamsweerde and vinoodh matadin can be seen in harper's bazaar's october issue. In the cover story, gaga discusses her affinity for designers like thierry mugler and hussein chalayan and proclaims that without the late alexander mcqueen's creations, \" i'd be naked. \" ( in her last bazaar cover story, she revealed that mcqueen had been working \" through her \", which we take to mean... Well, we're not really sure what that means ). Turns out stripping down for the shoot, in which she sports only a skimpy slip, has always come natural. \" even when i was a kid, i used to run around naked with the babysitter, driving her crazy, \" gaga reveals to the mag. And the lady",
            "What do you really know about sure, she's always been very forthcoming about her roots in new york and feeling out of place growing up — but there's always much more to the story. In an extended preview for the upcoming gaga by gaultier, the outlandish performer leaves no question unanswered as she unabashedly talks about her attraction to women, drugs and being an exhibitionist. \"i like women, \" she says bluntly, \"sexually. \" the special, which airs monday september 12 on the cw, includes footage from before she found fame, behind the scenes access and promises \"no limits \" as to what will be discussed."

The average person is exposed to 2.4 millisieverts of radiation a year, while the worker was exposed to 15.7 millisieverts ( 19.8 millisieverts when other plants he's worked at are taken into account ). \" this is a massive blow to the [ international atomic energy agency ], which stated in september of this year that no discernible health effects due to the exposure to radiation released by the accident are to be expected, \" greenpeace said in a statement, per cnn. The japanese government has been reticent in linking radiation exposure to cancer, blaming hundreds of deaths instead on other mental and physical hardships residents endured, nbc news notes. The announcement comes just weeks after two nuclear reactors were restarted at fukushima, and nearby \" ghost town \" naraha finally got its evacuation order removed. More than 70,000 fukushima prefecture residents still can't return home, per the journal. Up to 10 other workers have also applied for compensation, though many requests have already been denied or withdrawn, per cnn and the journal. Total cleanup and decommissioning of the plant is to stretch at least four decades, per the journal, with the tokyo electric power company anticipating spending tens of billions to complete the job, nbc notes.

        "summary": "The fdic and federal reserve both unanimously approved the long-debated volcker rule today, and three other regulatory agencies plan to before the day is out, making it official. The rule, named for and originally proposed by paul volcker, aims to ban proprietary trading, \" or in plain english, \" as the washington post puts it, \" it removes the parts of banks that gamble and act like hedge funds, because those parts can blow up. \" or at least, that's what it was supposed to do. But big banks like jpmorgan chase and goldman sachs have been lobbying against the law for more than three years, bloomberg points out, and their \" lobbying efforts paid off \" in easing some provisions. On the other hand, recent weeks have seen a charge from regulators favoring a tougher version, and they've scored points, too, the new york times reports. Here's what each side won: the tough side: when jpmorgan lost $ 6 billion on the london whale trade, it said the position was a \" hedge. \" the rule still allows hedging, but banks will now have to name a specific, quantifiable risk that each such trade is hedging against. Bonuses and compensation must be structured in a manner that doesn't encourage \" prohibited proprietary trading. \" chief executives will have to personally \" attest \" every year that the bank has measures in place to comply with the rule. The not-so-tough side: banks have until july of 2015 to implement the rule, though they must make a \" good faith effort \" to do so before that. Banks are still allowed to \" make markets, \" meaning to act as middle men for clients who want to buy and sell stock. Under this guise, banks could buy and hold a stock, arguing that a client might someday want to buy it. The rule mandates that banks buy only enough to meet the \" reasonably expected near-term demands of clients, \" but leaves it up to banks to decide what's reasonable. Banks can still make proprietary trades in bonds issued by governments. Many banks tell the wall street journal that they think they're already in compliance with the law, while some business groups say they intend to challenge the rule in court. Reform advocates, meanwhile, are starting to call again for a return to glass-steagall.",

The amen break is six seconds of fiery drumming laid down on a track by funk and soul group the winstons in the 1969 track \" amen, brother, \" and first sampled by legendary dj afrika bambaataa in the late 1970s. Back in 2011, the economist reported that the \" short burst of drumming changed the face of music, \" and bbc radio 1 did a full segment a year later. The website whosampled.com now says it's the most sampled song in history, at 2,262 times ( and counting ) across a range of genres. But what makes the short drumming clip so universally loved by modern musicians? fivethirtyeight reports that a power blackout ( in new york in 1977, which led to looting and the sudden existence of pricey audio equipment in parts of the bronx and brooklyn that dramatically increased the number of djs ) and a new piece of equipment ( the sampler, which came out in 1984 ) are behind the break's rise, while a few djs say its distortion and flash of kicks and snares make it rich with character. And, of course, it's now utterly recognizable — featured prominently in the futurama and powerpuff girls theme songs, david bowie's \" little wonder, \" and much more. Unfortunately, drummer gregory coleman never saw a penny despite all the sampling, and he died homeless in 2006. ( bambaataa is considered one of the godfathers of hip hop. )",

That's according to a huge study on jealousy among people of different sexes and sexualities. Researchers at chapman university polled some 64,000 people on how they'd react to hypothetical infidelity, and they found that while gay men and women, as well as bisexual men and women, didn't much differ in their feelings on the matter, heterosexuals did. Straight men, more often than women, found sexual infidelity to be the most disturbing kind, while straight women, more often than men, were most bothered by emotional infidelity — eg, their partners falling in love with another person, a press release reports. \" heterosexual men really stand out from all other groups: they were the only ones who were much more likely to be most upset by sexual infidelity rather than emotional infidelity, \" says a researcher. And as time reports, the findings held true regardless of factors like marital and parental status, income, and whether one had been cheated on in the past. ( one caveat: younger people were more bothered by sexual infidelity than older respondents, perhaps because sex plays a larger role in their lives, time notes. ) an evolutionary explanation for the phenomenon would hold that a man can't know for sure whether a child is his own, therefore men are concerned about sexual cheating. A sociocultural explanation would note that men are socialized to take pride in sexual ability, and a partner cheating suggests the man's talents are not so impressive.

Gay men and lesbian women also did not differ. \" heterosexual men really stand out from all other groups: they were the only ones who were much more likely to be most upset by sexual infidelity rather than emotional infidelity, \" said david frederick, ph.d.",

She was not — you won't be surprised to learn — pleased with my behavior. But what i was surprised to learn ( bearing in mind the young, male and stupid thing again ) was that she was less upset by the sexual aspect of my infidelity than the emotional. Soon enough, i came to learn that that was the way of things when it comes to women's reactions to cheating — or at least that's the stereotype. The equally glib corollary is that men can tolerate the nuzzling and canoodling part of infidelity better than they can the flesh crescendo it leads to. Now, research out of chapman university in orange, california confirms that when it comes to this one aspect of the great gender divide, the big news is that there is no news to report.

As it is, there's a chance — albeit a small one — that pieces of the space lab that don't burn up in the atmosphere could land in a populated area. It's also possible some of the debris could hit a satellite, space.com reports. China says it will release a forecast of the fall of the 34-foot-long, 9.4-ton tiangong-1 \" if necessary. \" experts believe the space lab was damaged in some way that made china lose control of it, hence the lack of a controlled re-entry.

John bailey, who became the 34th president of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences on aug. 8, is under investigation by the organization following multiple allegations of sexual harassment. An academy subcommittee led by david rubin began reviewing the allegations on wednesday after receiving three separate claims of harassment, sources close to the situation tell the hollywood reporter. Bailey did not respond to a direct request for comment. The academy, later on friday, issued the following statement: \" the academy treats any complaints confidentially to protect all parties. The membership committee reviews all complaints brought against academy members according to our standards of conduct process, and after completing reviews, reports to the board of governors. We will not comment further on such matters until the full review is completed. \" bailey, a veteran cinematographer who succeeded cheryl boone isaacs as president, has represented the cinematographers branch of the academy for 15 years. His film credits include ordinary people, american gigolo, the big chill and groundhog day. In 2014, bailey received the american society of cinematographers ' lifetime achievement award. In october, in the wake of the media reports about serial sexual misconduct by harvey weinstein that sparked the #metoo and time's up movements, the academy expelled weinstein and bailey emailed its members to say that the academy would henceforth investigate reports of similar misbehavior. He said that organization would not serve as an \" inquisitorial court, \" but would support the \" vulnerable. \" in january, the academy adopted a new code of conduct governing workplace harassment and misconduct. Under these guidelines, claims can be submitted through a link on the academy website or by calling the academy's membership department. The code states that claims must include supporting evidence, which can be a second witness, a second party who was told of the violation, a written report or evidence that the claim is part of an established pattern.

            "Three separate claims were leveled against the exec, who was elected to lead the organization last august. John bailey, who became the 34th president of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences on aug. 8, is under investigation by the organization following multiple allegations of sexual harassment. An academy subcommittee led by david rubin began reviewing the allegations on wednesday after receiving three separate claims of harassment, sources close to the situation tell the hollywood reporter. Bailey did not respond to a direct request for comment. The academy, later on friday, issued the following statement: \" the academy treats any complaints confidentially to protect all parties. The membership committee reviews all complaints brought against academy members according to our standards of conduct process, and after completing reviews, reports to the board of governors. We will not comment further on such matters until the full review is completed. \" bailey, a veteran cinematographer who succeeded cheryl boone isaacs as president, has represented the cinematographers branch of the academy for 15 years. His film credits include ordinary people, american gigolo, the big chill and groundhog day. In 2014, bailey received the american society of cinematographers ' lifetime achievement award. In october, in the wake of the media reports about serial sexual misconduct by harvey weinstein that sparked the #metoo and time's up movements, the academy expelled weinstein and bailey emailed its members to say that the academy would henceforth investigate reports of similar misbehavior. He said that organization would not serve as an \" inquisitorial court, \" but would support the \" vulnerable. \" in january, the academy adopted a new code of conduct governing workplace harassment and misconduct. Under these guidelines, claims can be submitted through a link on the academy website or by calling the academy's membership department. The code states that claims must include supporting evidence, which can be a second witness, a second party who was told of the violation, a written report or evidence that the claim is part of an established pattern. In a letter to members at the time, academy ceo dawn hudson explained, \"the academy's goal is not to be an an investigative body, but rather ensure that when a grievance is made, it will go through a fair and methodical process.

The knoxville news sentinel reports the body of 53-year-old mitzie sue clements was found tuesday afternoon, less than a mile south of the appalachian trail and a couple of miles west from where people park to visit clingmans dome, per a park release. The park noted in a facebook post last week that clements disappeared on sept. 25 on the forney ridge trail after she became separated from her daughter, who said she'd gotten ahead of her mother on the trail late that afternoon and that clements never caught up. The search for clements was an intense one in inclement weather, with more than 100 people from dozens of agencies joining in, as well as canine helpers, helicopters, and search-and-rescue drones. A new cellphone tower was even put up to help rescuers combat bad service and stay in communication as they searched. Scientists toiled over digital composites of the landscape, and medical professionals consulted with officials on how clements might be reacting as she struggled to survive. Bad weather, rough terrain, and thick vegetation also slowed efforts down, per wate. \" our hearts are with the family and friends of ms. Clements, \" the park tweeted tuesday evening, thanking everyone who'd helped with the search. A gofundme set up by another of clements'daughters has raised more than $ 5,000 that will now go toward funeral costs rather than the travel expenses her family initially sought help with.",

Those researchers are reporting on the results of a small study in which they used smartphone \" sensor data \" to discern just that. The researchers came to their conclusion by looking at total phone usage, the number of locations visited per the phone's gps, and the daily schedule recorded by such tracking over a 14-day period. The 28 participants also completed a standardized questionnaire designed to gauge depression. Half exhibited mild to severe depression, and half did not, and the researchers say they were able to accurately predict which smartphone owners had depressive symptoms 86.5 % of the time. In the usage category, those who weren't depressed logged about 17 minutes of usage, compared to an average 68 minutes among the depressed set. As for how gps factors in, those who less frequently ventured beyond home were more likely to be depressed, as were those who didn't tend to have a recurring routine ( ie, leaving for work at the same time daily ). That's not too surprising: lead author david mohr explains in a press release that \" when people are depressed, they tend to withdraw and don't have the motivation or energy to go out and do things. \" what was potentially more surprising is that the data \" was more reliable in detecting depression \" than the questions the participants answered, potentially providing a passive, unobtrusive way to detect depression. The study, published today in the journal of medical internet research, notes the findings \" must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms. \"",

            "Chicago --- you can fake a smile, but your phone knows the truth. Depression can be detected from your smartphone sensor data by tracking the number of minutes you use the phone and your daily geographical locations, reports a small northwestern medicine study. The more time you spend using your phone, the more likely you are depressed. The average daily usage for depressed individuals was about 68 minutes, while for non-depressed individuals it was about 17 minutes. Spending most of your time at home and most of your time in fewer locations -- as measured by gps tracking -- also are linked to depression. And, having a less regular day-to-day schedule, leaving your house and going to work at different times each day, for example, also is linked to depression. Based on the phone sensor data, northwestern scientists could identify people with depressive symptoms with 87 percent accuracy. \" the significance of this is we can detect if a person has depressive symptoms and the severity of those symptoms without asking them any questions, \" said senior author david mohr, director of the center for behavioral intervention technologies at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine. \" we now have an objective measure of behavior related to depression.

The 20-year-old was attending college on an electrician's scholarship and was just weeks shy of graduating, but he'd spent the past several months as a drug informant after police caught him selling a small amount of marijuana — $ 80 total. In a video of a meeting between sadek and a narcotics detective, sadek is encouraged to agree to make a handful of drug buys for police in exchange for avoiding felony charges, with the potential penalty being up to 40 years in prison and a $ 40,000 fine.

On twitter, ocasio-cortez explained that young activists pushing for legislation on climate change asked her to join them, and she accepted.

She said the issue affected her \" not just as an elected member, but as a 29-year-old woman \" worried about the coming decades.

            "The bel-air estate may be known as chartwell, but it's off the charts in terms of asking price. The home of the late univision billionaire a. Jerrold perenchio is for sale at $ 350 million — making it the most expensive u.s. Residential listing.",
            "One of bel air's most storied estates is now the priciest home in the country. The chartwell estate, owned by late tv executive and univision head jerry perenchio, hit the market today with an astronomical $ 350 million asking price. That's a whole $ 100 million higher than the lavish $ 250 million bel air spec house listed earlier this year by developer bruce makowsky — previously the nation's priciest listing, by our reckoning. The home was built in 1933 by architect sumner spaulding, who also designed harold lloyd's famous greenacres estate in beverly hills. In the 1960s, the sprawling french neoclassical house was famously used for exterior shots of the clampett residence on the beverly hillbillies. Featuring 25,000 square feet of living space, the enormous home is nestled on a 10-acre lot with carefully sculpted gardens, fountains, grassy lawns, and a 75-foot swimming pool ( the estate is on the short-list for the most water guzzling household in la ). Other luxurious features include a wallace neff-designed guest house, a tennis court, ballroom, wine cellar, and covered parking for 40 vehicles. The property is listed with jeff hyland, drew fenton and gary gold of hilton &amp; hyland; joyce rey, jade mills and alexandra allen of coldwell banker global luxury; and drew gitlin and susan gitlin of berkshire hathaway home services.",

        "summary": "The pentagon's transparency in its fight against overseas extremists is being questioned after a military times investigation revealed perhaps thousands of secret airstrikes in iraq, afghanistan, and syria were never publicly disclosed. The us air force has an open-source database tapped by congress, analysts, and others to figure out how costly war is, both on the financial and human fronts. But, per the times investigation, nearly 460 afghanistan airstrikes were carried out in 2016 by us combat aircraft, strikes that weren't included in the database. Another major discrepancy, among others: a public pentagon report on iraq and syria strikes has apparently left out 6,000 or so strikes since 2014. Us central command, which supervises engagement in those three countries, isn't sure yet how long these omissions have occurred and couldn't give the times a full accounting of all airstrikes. These findings have critics worrying the military either hasn't been forthcoming or has been sloppy on other data as well, including how many service members have been lost; what the fight against isis, the taliban, al-qaeda, and related offshoots is costing us taxpayers; and what our real progress against these groups is. But one us military official tells the times that while some of the tracking omissions are \" really weird, \" it's \" unequivocally \" not an attempt at subterfuge. \" that is just the way it has been tracked in the past, \" the official says. And another army official at the senior level notes some close-to-ground maneuvers shouldn't really be classified as airstrikes. Kenneth roth, executive director of human rights watch, says, security reasons aside, \" facts regarding the number of airstrikes and their civilian toll should always be disclosed promptly and faithfully. \"",

            "A series of paralyzing street protests showed little sign of abating after officials in brazil's two largest cities bowed to popular demand and revoked an increase in bus fares. Authorities in sao paulo and rio de janeiro yesterday said they were scrapping the increases even as they struggle with strained budgets to pay for the cuts. Starting june 24, bus and subway tickets in sao paulo will cost 3 reais ( $ 1.35 ), the same price before a 20 centavo increase took effect this month. Organizers of the nation's biggest protests in almost two decades had vowed to remain on the streets until fares were lowered. Still, the decision over transport costs may be too late to quell a movement that has mushroomed into a catch-all for discontent over everything from inflation to the quality of public education. Last night, masked protesters tried to commandeer latin america's longest bridge, and a march is scheduled in sao paulo today. \"we don't expect people to just quit protesting, \" rio mayor eduardo paes said while announcing the fare cuts. \"people are protesting for more than just bus fares, and that's their right. We're just listening to what they're saying, and this is a way to show it. \" the nation's attention yesterday was on the city of fortaleza,",
            "1 of 11. Students, and members of the \" free pass \" movement walk down a street during a protest demanding improvements be made to the public transport system, at the bus station in the centre of brasilia june 19, 2013. Sao paulo/fortaleza, brazil &#124; sao paulo/fortaleza, brazil ( reuters ) - brazil's two biggest cities agreed on wednesday to revoke an increase in public transportation fares that set off demonstrations that have grown into nationwide protests against poor public services, inflation and corruption. The decisions, made separately in sao paulo and rio de janeiro, followed another day of protests across brazil, which also included a march by demonstrators around a major international soccer game in the northeastern city of fortaleza. This month's transport fare hikes, which came as brazil struggles with annual inflation of 6.5 percent, stirred a groundswell of other complaints, leading to the biggest protests to sweep brazil in more than two decades. The protests have been organized by a disparate group of activists who have rallied supporters via social media. Sao paulo state governor geraldo alckmin, announcing a reduction in fares to their level before the hike, called it \" important...

Mary's county sheriff's office has identified seven suspects: police say five mask- and hoodie-clad males broke into chopticon high school by busting in a door, triggering an alarm; two others remained in the car.

Four are juveniles and have been hit with fourth-degree burglary, property destruction under $ 1,000, and disruption of school activities charges, reports wusa-tv; the other three will be charged as adults by criminal summons. There also have been consequences at the school, consequences some students are protesting as unfair: they say one male who was involved got the green light to play in the baseball state championship game post-prank, but that the class president is being barred from giving a speech at tomorrow's graduation.

Dupixent could finally provide relief to people suffering from severe eczema — which goes beyond mere patches of itchy, dry skin and can cause sleeplessness, depression, and social anxiety — but it will run $ 37,000 a year. That's actually well below the $ 50,000 price tag of best-selling drugs humira and enbrel for skin diseases such as psoriasis, reports the new york times. And this drug looks highly effective; in clinical trials, somewhere between one-third and two-thirds of participants enjoyed clear or nearly clear skin, reports cbs news. \" now that i can live a normal life again, i've gotten engaged and we're getting married in august, \" says one study participant. The drug is administered by injection to treat adults with moderate to severe eczema using the antibody dupilumab, which binds to a protein that causes inflammation, thus preventing an outbreak. One teacher in a clinical trial tells the times the drug started working in five days and has changed her life, while an unaffiliated dermatologist and pediatrician calls it \" groundbreaking \" for a condition that \" doesn't kill you, but ruins your life. \" in an unusual move, the company that developed the drug, regeneron, negotiated pricing directly with insurers. Most people with insurance won't have to pay the full price, but it's not unheard of to have to pay as much as half, or the full price until reaching one's deductible. \" right now they have the benefit of being alone, \" says one analyst. \" but going forward, i think there will be a lot of price competition. \" ( this cheap and simple product helps reduce eczema in babies. )",

What's next: lots of negotiations between the city and separate stakeholders.

Here's how analysts see the democratic race developing in the weeks ahead: the race is all but over, according to chris cillizza at the washington post, who points to clinton's big margin of victory in the super tuesday states that award the most delegates. \" clinton has a death grip on the democratic nomination, \" he writes. \" the only question is how and when she and her team negotiate a peace with sanders. \" sanders has been unable to gain much support from minority voters and clinton has now pulled too far ahead to be caught, according to evan halper at the los angeles times. For sanders to win now, he would have to win more than 60 % of the remaining delegates — and that's before all the superdelegates supporting clinton are added to the equation. The wins in minnesota, colorado, oklahoma, and vermont give sanders the rationale he needs to continue, writes kyle cheney at politico. The next states to vote are nebraska, kansas, and maine, which are all sanders-friendly states, but they may not be enough for him to launch a comeback. With the win in massachusetts proving that she \" can best her left-wing rival on his home turf in the northeast, \" clinton is now beginning her general election campaign, writes niall stanage at the hill, who notes that she barely mentioned sanders in her victory speech.

        "summary": "Cardi b turned herself in to new york police monday morning and was arrested and charged over a fight at a strip club in the city aug. 29. The rap superstar was at angels strip club that night because migos was performing; her husband, offset, is a member of the hip-hop trio. Sources tell tmz cardi, who was released monday after being fingerprinted and having her mugshot taken, has long had a problem with one of the bartenders, jade, because she believed jade once slept with offset. Cardi allegedly confronted jade and her sister, fellow bartender baddie gi, and then told her entourage to attack the women. Cardi, who just had a baby the month prior to the incident and also recently got into an alleged brawl with nicki minaj, was \" throwing chairs, bottles, and hookahs in the club at 3am, \" a police spokesperson tells cnn. Both bartenders were assaulted, he says. Tmz's sources say both women refused medical attention, and cardi's lawyer says, \" we're aware of no evidence that she caused anybody any harm on that night. We expect that the matter is going to be resolved expeditiously. \" one of tmz's other sources says the alleged attack was actually \" spontaneous, \" triggered by someone throwing a drink. But the lawyer for the alleged victims says \" cardi b ordered and committed violent assaults against my clients, and is being called to justice for her crimes. Apparently, she thinks her celebrity status puts her above the law, since she has bragged to multiple people and on social media that she orchestrated these vicious attacks. But reality is setting in, as justice does not care whether her name is cardi b or carly b, and she will now answer for her crimes. \" the rapper was charged with assault and reckless endangerment, both misdemeanors, and is scheduled to be arraigned oct. 29.",
