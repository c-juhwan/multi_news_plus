Mark fedor, and should new information surface, the search could be restarted. But for now, \" we believe we have reached a limit for our search-and-rescue efforts. \" the boys were last sighted july 24 about 1: 30pm; their capsized boat was found two days later. Usa today reports the coast guard search has covered an area roughly the size of florida that stretched from southern florida to south carolina. The post notes that while the families have chosen not to speak publicly, they will continue their private search via rented planes and boats, per a statement. To that end, they intend to keep a gofundme account active. At this point, science isn't on the boys'side.",

Shkreli is accused of pilfering stock from his former company, retrophin, and using it to take care of other business debts, per bloomberg. Prosecutors say when shkreli's msmb capital hedge fund went bust, losing millions, he started playing what bloomberg calls a \" complicated shell game \" that involved \" secret payoffs \" and \" sham consulting arrangements. \" the sec, which has been looking into shkreli's dealings for the past three years, is also expected to file a civil suit against him, sources tell bloomberg. In august, retrophin actually sued its former ceo, who was kicked out of the company in october 2014. The biotech firm alleged, among other things, that shkreli had set up multiple transactions between the company and msmb investors, bankrupted msmb, paid off as many as 10 msmb investors through phony contracts or by dipping into company stock and cash without permission, and then tried to cover it all up via what bloomberg frames as \" complex financial maneuvers. \" shkreli's reaction at the time: \" the $ 65 million retrophin wants from me would not dent me. I feel great. I ' m licking my chops over the suits i ' m going to file against them. \" ( this means a jailed brooklyn rapper will have to wait a little longer to make bail. )",

Even so, the unemployment rate fell to 3.7 %, the lowest level since 1969. Florence struck north and south carolina and closed thousands of businesses. As a result, a jobs category that includes restaurants, hotels, and casinos lost ground for the first time since last september, when hurricane harvey had a similar effect. Average hourly pay increased just 2.8 % from a year earlier in september, reports the ap, one tick below the yearly gain in august. September extended the longest streak of hiring on record, with millions of americans having gone back to work since the great recession. The september gain extended an 8½-year streak of monthly job growth. Measures of consumer confidence are at or near their highest levels in 18 years. Retailers have begun scrambling to hire enough workers for what's expected to be a robust holiday shopping season. A survey of service-sector firms, including banks, hotels, and health care providers, found that they are expanding at their fastest pace in a decade. Households are saving nearly 7 % of their incomes — more than twice the savings rate before the recession. During the april-june quarter, the us economy expanded at a 4.2 % annual rate, the best in four years.

It reports the search for the women was hampered by bad weather; their bodies were found about 12 hours apart, around 5: 30am and 5pm saturday. Willamette week reports the women were clamming just 8 miles apart from each other at opposite ends of the willapa bay's mouth, which sits in the southwest corner of the state.

The image was discovered in the 1990s in a network of limestone caves on the eastern edge of the island, npr reports. And, recently, researchers used dating technology to determine the painting to be at least 40,000 years old — older than similar paintings in europe by more than 4,000 years, per science. Rather than being simply an \"abstract design, \" as older cave paintings are, figurative paintings like the cow portrait are \"clearly like someone decided to depict what they saw, \" says australian archaeologist maxime aubert, who published his team's \"amazing \" findings in nature. \"the meaning of the animal is unknown, \" aubert says, per usa today, \"we think it wasn't just food for them. It meant something special. \" the cave where the cow image was discovered is a \"vast and ancient gallery, \" says national geographic. The prehistoric artwork includes other animal renderings, paintings of stick figure humans with headdresses and spears, and stencils of human hands made by blowing liquid ochre over a hand pressed against rock, the earliest of which are more than 50,000 years old. According to aubert, ancient artists added new images to the cave over a span of 30,000 years. ( some ancient artists were high when they created their abstract paintings. )",

Matthias ernst at the olivia newton-john cancer research institute explains that white blood cells called macrophages help to heal wounds and remove damaged cells in the body. But those with a protein called hematopoietic cell kinase ( hck ) can also be hijacked by cancer cells to fuel cancer, reports the herald sun. As ernst puts it to the age, \" the more hck activity a macrophage has, the more it nurtures cancer cell growth and survival. \" ernst believed, however, that inhibiting the hck protein would prevent cancer cells from taking over. When researchers used a drug-like molecule to inhibit the protein in animal tests, existing colon and stomach cancers stopped growing. The appearance of new cancers was also reduced, reports news.com.au. \" our discovery could potentially offer a new and complementary approach to chemotherapy and immunotherapy as options for treating gastrointestinal cancers, \" which is especially important as colon cancers are usually resistant to most immunotherapy treatments, ernst says. He adds a drug that inhibits hck could be ready for clinical trials within three years and may also treat other cancers. An australian health minister calls it a \" revolutionary development \" with \" the potential to one day save thousands of lives. \" ( the risk of colon and rectal cancer is rising. )",

Flame is probably behind a disruption in iran's oil industry last month, the guardian reports. Analysts haven't identified the designer of the virus, but assume a government with a formidable budget and a large team worked on it for months — so fingers will point to the us and israel, the guardian notes.

The boy, tyler maddox, is now in critical but stable condition in the hospital. Hillsborough county deputies say linda maddox, 63, was watching tyler and his twin brother while their father was at work, wesh reports. After the father left, maddox wedged a chair against the bedroom door as a device to catch intruders; grandmother and grandsons then all fell asleep in the same bed. About 1am, maddox heard the chair move. She told police she grabbed the gun, pointed it at the door in the dark, and shot. Then tyler started to scream — the bullet had hit him in his upper body. Maddox hasn't been arrested or charged, but an investigation continues. ( a deputy in virginia also recently shot his daughter after mistaking her for an intruder. )",

What was once thought to be a single core of solid iron actually contains an inner core of its own with properties very different from what geologists who measured earthquake waves now refer to as the \" outer inner core, \" cnet reports. The iron crystals in the \" inner inner core \" are aligned on an east-to-west axis, while the outer ones are aligned north to south, according to the researchers, whose study was published in the journal nature this week. The newly discovered core is about half the diameter of the original core area, which is around the same size as the moon. Researchers say that analysis of the core, which began to solidify around a billion years ago, could hold the key to how our planet evolved. The team discovered the inner core by analyzing the seismic waves that echo after earthquakes. \" the earthquake is like a hammer striking a bell; much like a listener hears the clear tone that resonates after the bell strike, seismic sensors collect a coherent signal in the earthquake's coda, \" a university of illinois report on the findings explains. It's not clear why the inner core is so different from the outer one, but a university of cambridge expert tells the bbc that it seems \" something very substantial happened to flip the orientation of the core \" around half a billion years ago.

What demarcates this \" inner-inner core \" is that the iron crystals it contains are oriented on an east-west axis, unlike the iron crystals in the \" outer-inner core \" which organize along a north-south axis. \" the fact that we have two regions that are distinctly different may tell us something about how the inner core has been evolving, \" xiaodong song, a professor of geology at ui who worked on the project with visiting postdoctoral",

Research from china and the us suggests that the innermost core of our planet has another, distinct region at its centre. The team believes that the structure of the iron crystals there is different from those found in the outer part of the inner core. The findings are reported in the journal nature geoscience. Without being able to drill into the heart of the earth, its make-up is something of a mystery. The fact we are discovering different structures...

The latest strikes came on the third day of a us-led air campaign aimed at routing the group in syria, and were aimed at one of the militants ' main revenue streams. Isis captured most of syria's largest oil fields earlier this year and is believed to be partly funding its operations by smuggling oil out and selling it on the black market to the tune of up to $ 3 million a day. Other developments: at least four oil installations and three oil fields were hit near the town of mayadeen, with at least 14 militants killed there, notes the ap. Other strikes hit checkpoints, compounds, training grounds, and vehicles of the islamic state. Muhsin al-fadhli, the alleged leader of terror group khorasan, was reportedly killed yesterday in a series of strikes west of aleppo, reports the washington post, though american intelligence hasn't confirmed his death. The overnight strikes were carried out by 18 aircraft from the us air force, the united arab emirates, and saudi arabia, reports cbs news. All aircraft returned safely to their bases.

But it's being thrown around now in the wake of what carnival says were \" violent and disruptive acts \" committed on its cruise ship legend. Passengers say a brawl that erupted around 12: 45am friday — resulting in an unexpected stop and the removal of 23 family members — was the culmination of days of violence that left as many as 30 people injured aboard the \" cruise from hell, \" per 3aw. Passengers tell 9news that people were left bloodied after clashes between two groups of passengers, including members of an australian family, who threatened to stab others and throw them overboard. \" it was a bloodbath, \" a man says, adding that some passengers were afraid to leave their cabins. A woman on vacation with her family says certain passengers \" looking for trouble \" were responsible for fights seen over several days. When her husband told them to take the violence away from their kids, \" five of them surrounded \" him and \" told us to watch our backs, \" she tells 3aw. They punched and kicked another man apparently because he made eye contact with one of the group, a woman says, per the age. Footage of friday's brawl shows security officials kicking at passengers grappling on the ground amid screams. In what carnival calls an \" unprecedented \" step, per news.com.au, nine males were kicked off the boat later friday when it stopped in eden, australia, say new south wales police. Fourteen others also left the ship. Carnival says \" a full internal investigation \" is underway.",

According to the los angeles times, james nichols, 44, and luis valenzuela, 43, were charged tuesday with multiple crimes, include rape. The alleged sexual assaults started in 2008 when nichols and valenzuela became partners and continued into 2011. The pair have been under investigation since at least 2013. The los angeles police department says both officers have been removed from duty. All four of the victims — ranging in age from 19 to 35 at the time of the assaults — were arrested multiple times by nichols and valenzuela on suspicion of narcotics-related offenses. Cbs news reports the officers would allegedly threaten further arrests if the women didn't have sex with them. Charging documents say the sexual assaults mostly happened while nichols and valenzuela were on duty and sometimes took place in their police vehicle. On at least one occasion, the officers allegedly restrained one of the victims during an assault. And valenzuela has been charged with pointing a gun at one of the women. The officers are scheduled to be arraigned on thursday and will likely be held on more than $ 3 million bail.",

The dismissal of mr mnangagwa last week had left mr mugabe's wife grace as the president's likely successor.

The woman said she tried to fend off her attacker, a colleague, by saying, \" stop it \" and \" enough, \" but didn't cry out for help, the washington post reports. As a result, the judge called the woman's account \" unlikely \" and said the 2011 attack \" did not exist, \" the bbc reports. He faulted her for not showing \" adequate emotion that a violation of her person had to inspire in her. \" the woman said the man forced himself on her and threatened to withhold work if she didn't comply. She told the court that \" sometimes saying no is enough, \" adding that \" maybe i did not use the force and violence that in reality i should have used, but that is because \" the man was \" too strong. \" now she faces a slander charge. The defendant, 46, a red cross worker, maintained the two had consensual sex. The ruling has prompted the justice minister to demand an investigation. Lawmaker annagrazia calabria fumed that the \" incomprehensible \" decision left her \" speechless, \" adding, \" certainly, you cannot punish the personal reaction of a woman terrified by what is happening to her. \" the post notes that it's not the first controversial judgment in italy involving sexual assault. In 1999, a high court famously threw out a rape conviction because the young victim wore tight jeans.

        "summary": "\" we have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you, \" mark zuckerberg said in a facebook post wednesday, breaking his silence on what he calls \" the cambridge analytica situation. \" it was the facebook ceo's first public statement since the scandal broke over four days earlier, the ap reports. In fact, according to slate, the post broke the longest stretch of time zuckerberg has gone without posting on the social media site he created. His most recent post before wednesday was back on march 2. A statement from zuckerberg was probably overdue after news that cambridge analytica accessed the personal data of over 50 million facebook accounts to help the trump campaign caused facebook to lose nearly $ 50 billion from its stock price and a \" delete facebook \" movement to gain popularity, cnn reports. In his post, zuckerberg claimed facebook already made major changes in 2014 that would prevent a repeat of cambridge analytica's actions. ( the personality quiz app that gathered the data used in the cambridge analytica incident was developed in 2013. ) those changes included not allowing apps to have access to data belonging to a user's friends. But, he added, \" there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it. \" that includes investigating apps that had access to lots of user information prior to the changes in 2014; auditing apps with suspicious activity; tightening access to user data, such as by cutting off access to apps that haven't been used in three months; and more transparency in what apps have access to users ' information. \" i started facebook, and at the end of the day i ' m responsible for what happens on our platform, \" zuckerberg said. \" i ' m serious about doing what it takes to protect our community. \"",

        "summary": "Would it be like to live a life completely void of fear? npr's invisibilia tackled that question in its second episode by talking to antonio damasio, a university of southern california neuroscientist who has treated a woman — referred to as sm — with an inability to feel fear. Sm suffers from urbach-wiethe disease, placing her among a group of only about 400 people on the planet with the condition. It's one that could leave her vulnerable to threats, so much so that sm has never spoken with a journalist out of concern her identity would somehow leak. But she had been the subject of published studies: one that ran in current biology in 2011 confirmed her fearlessness even after exposing her to snakes, a haunted house, and horror films; another study a year earlier explored her willingness to make risky gambling moves. But in a first, sm did participate in the npr interview, answering a list of questions penned by invisibilia hosts and posed to her by another of her doctors, who recorded her answers. The disease caused sm's amygdala ( a part of the brain whose function relates to fear ) to be completely calcified sometime in her teens; she reveals she has one memory of being slightly afraid, while not wanting to touch a catfish caught while fishing as a child. Her amygdala can't tell her that her palms should be sweating — even when she's been held at gunpoint ( twice ) and knifepoint ( also twice ). But she does have logic, so she understands that if a car is barreling down the street, she should try to get out of its way. Damasio explains that because she doesn't register these moments as traumatic, she's hasn't experienced trauma — mostly. In a 2013 study that touched on the threat of suffocation, sm inhaled carbon dioxide via gas mask and panicked after feeling like she couldn't breathe.",

            "Abstract losses are a possibility in many risky decisions, and organisms have evolved mechanisms to evaluate and avoid them. Laboratory and field evidence suggests that people often avoid risks with losses even when they might earn a substantially larger gain, a behavioral preference termed \"loss aversion. \" the cautionary brake on behavior known to rely on the amygdala is a plausible candidate mechanism for loss aversion, yet evidence for this idea has so far not been found. We studied two rare individuals with focal bilateral amygdala lesions using a series of experimental economics tasks. To measure individual sensitivity to financial losses we asked participants to play a variety of monetary gambles with possible gains and losses. Although both participants retained a normal ability to respond to changes in the gambles ' expected value and risk, they showed a dramatic reduction in loss aversion compared to matched controls. The findings suggest that the amygdala plays a key role",

        "summary": "First, oregon's first lady admitted to an \" illegal \" previous marriage, then to planning a marijuana grow operation and running a consulting business out of the governor's mansion. Now, gov. John kitzhaber's fiancee cylvia hayes faces claims that she was paid consulting fees to influence her future husband. The oregonian finds two kitzhaber associates, who later joined his administration, connected hayes with jobs that landed her $ 143,000, including $ 118,000 from a clean-energy group from 2011 to 2012, while she served as an unpaid energy adviser to kitzhaber. She allegedly failed to report the income on tax forms, nor did kitzhaber account for the money on his ethics filings, the los angeles times reports. While kitzhaber has said hayes \" will have no policy role and no political role in the administration \" for the rest of his term, \" kitzhaber is already enacting policies hayes was paid to promote, \" the oregonian reports. Dan carol, the man who got hayes the gig with group clean economy development center, was soon after hired by kitzhaber. He now makes $ 165,720 a year, almost twice as much as kitzhaber himself and significantly more than anyone else on his staff, the willamette week reports. \" no one in the governor's office or the governor ever asked me to do anything for cylvia, \" carol says. \" when it fits and the work makes sense, i connect good people, groups and projects together. \" he adds he was hired because he had previously worked with kitzhaber and \" had the right skills and national connections. \" the oregon government ethics commission will vote march 13 on whether to launch an investigation, but the oregonian has already called on kitzhaber to resign, noting his \" credibility has evaporated. \" last week, kitzhaber said he wouldn't even consider resigning from his post. He added he had \" no regrets \" about his relationship with hayes and \" the marriage is still on. \"",

        "summary": "After four decades of hunting for the golden state killer, a pivotal piece of evidence that may have sealed the case was dna evidence secretly lifted from the suspect's car door at a hobby lobby parking lot in roseville, calif., reports the los angeles times. Newly released court documents paint a picture of how detectives linked alleged rapist and serial killer joseph deangelo to rapes and murders in california by matching dna found at the crime scenes to dna taken from the suspect. Deangelo, 72, is a former police officer suspected of committing at least a dozen murders and dozens of rapes in the 1970s and 80s. The 123 pages of court documents detail how detectives built their case by entering dna found at one of the crime scenes into genealogy websites. From there they were able to identify relatives of the suspect. After they narrowed their list by age and location, they had their suspect. The dna from the suspect's car door was just one piece of a massive jigsaw puzzle that detectives assembled, cnn notes. The documents detail how detectives watched the suspect's home in citrus heights, calif., for three days. The day before deangelo's arrest on april 24, they sifted through a trash can outside his home in hopes of finding dna samples, but only one piece of tissue had enough dna for testing. According to the washington post, dna from the tissue matched dna from the 1980 rape and murder of charlene smith, a ventura county interior decorator, and other homicides attributed to the golden state killer. Several victims have been attending court hearings on the case in sacramento — one, who said she was raped by the suspect, told the times that she is attending deangelo's court appearances to \" drill holes in the back of his head. \"",

As he walked into the craft store, it gave them a perfect chance to collect a secret dna sample. Police swabbed the driver's side handle of joseph james deangelo's car, according to arrest and search warrants released friday. Authorities sent it for testing and matched it to semen recovered at some of the golden state killer's crime scenes, the arrest warrant said. The dna collection at a public parking lot in roseville, california, became a crucial turning point in the decades-old search for the suspect in the killings.

But he failed his course for three straight years and returned to cambodia in 1953, just as the country was wriggling free of french colonialism. As ruler, pol pot oversaw more than 1 million deaths.

Ayatollah khomeini: iran's \" supreme leader \" spent much of his adult life as a lecturer and teacher, studying islamic philosophy and mysticism. He also wrote poetry and at least 25 essays and books; sadly, one of his poems issued a fatwa on author salman rushdie's head. His current regime is said to have killed up to 20,000 political activists. Timothy mcveigh: his role in the 1995 oklahoma city bombing — which murdered 168 and injured hundreds more — is well-known.

A top expert in handwriting, typewriting, and ballistics analysis, souder helped put away scores of murderers, gangsters, bootleggers, and thieves, per nist. Fearing reprisals against his family, souder kept his role low-key, and there is no accounting of how many high-profile crimes were among the more than 800 cases he worked on. But in may 1932, new jersey state police asked souder to examine ransom notes in the lindbergh kidnapping, which he dubbed the \" adamson case \" in his files to throw people off the trail; he eventually testified in the trial that saw bruno hauptmann convicted.

Kennedy was a historian, he says, and his assessment is in the context of hitler's place in history. He kept the diary after his military service ended, as he was touring europe as a journalist, notes the bbc. It's believed to be the only diary he ever kept. Kennedy eventually gave the 61-page diary, about 12 pages of which are handwritten, to its current owner, deirdre henderson, a onetime research assistant for kennedy. As cbs news notes, she previously published it in book form. While the information isn't new, the original document is expected to fetch $ 200,000 when it goes up for sale on april 26. Other highlights, per the ap: hitler's death: \" there is no complete evidence, however, that the body that was found was hitler's body, \" he wrote. \" the russians doubt that he is dead. \" the un: \" in practice, i doubt that it will prove effective in the sense of its elaborate mechanics being frequently employed or vitally decisive in deterring war or peace. \" ussr: \" yet, if we pull out ( of germany ), we may leave a political vacuum that the russians will be only too glad to fill. \"",

        "summary": "In a clash of kittens versus medical testing, the kittens are winning. For five decades, the us department of agriculture has been breeding and using kittens to study toxoplasmosis — a disease that is particularly dangerous in pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. The kittens are fed meat infected with a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis. Researchers use the stool samples to study the parasite, and the kittens are later euthanized. The watchdog group white coat waste project, which first reported the practice, estimates that hundreds of cats are killed each year as part of the project, but a government rep puts the figure at a few dozen. The kittens have found a champion in republican rep. Mike bishop, reports rollcall. The michigan congressman is co-sponsoring a bill with california democrat jimmy panetta to protect the kittens. Called \"kitten, \" for \" kittens in traumatic testing ends now, \" the bill would amend the animal welfare act to ban the use of cats in a way that causes suffering or distress. The department of agriculture's inhouse research agency, the agriculture research service, says the project provides valuable information that benefits public health and credits it with cutting by as much as one half the incidence of the parasite in the us and europe, reports the detroit news. The project is aimed at safeguarding contaminated water, meats, and produce, and is making \"progress towards a lifesaving vaccine, \" an ars rep tells bishop in a letter. Further, says the rep, the kittens are euthanized instead of adopted out because they pose a public health risk. The group is open to changing that, \" if safety considerations are met, \" she writes. ( this man risked his life to save a kitten. )",

She eventually did get legal help, from deputy prosecutor michaelia gilbert, who was going through old case files on wednesday, spotted hoffman's, and got a hearing held the next day, with hoffman's former public defender representing her. The presiding judge called the screw-up, well, \" a big screw-up. \" what hoffman did or didn't do about the mix-up while in jail is unclear; the judge asked why she didn't alert officials about her situation, but she didn't give an answer.

If i knew it was illegal, i wouldn't have done it. \" it's actually not illegal under arkansas law, but the officers at the scene used the child-endangerment charge to take her into custody. Adams says she had two beers in about 90 minutes, but a waitress ( not adams'server ) suspected she had more than that, and more than just beer. She eventually called police. That waitress, incidentally, was fired the following week. At the stir, adriana velez has mixed feelings about the case, given how unclear the medical evidence is on the subject. Most moms she knows follows guidelines from the american academy of pediatrics to wait two hours after having a drink, but \" it's still alarming that breastfeeding while drinking would land a mother in jail. \"",

The country's police minister says many others were injured and the toll is likely to rise. Another 10 people, including two police officers and two security guards, died in related violence earlier in the week. As strikers marched on the mine 40 miles northwest of johannesburg yesterday, police tried breaking up the march with water cannons, then stun grenades and tear gas, but opened fire when a group of machete-armed miners charged police lines. The violence has shocked south africa, with newspapers blaring headlines like \" bloodbath \", \" killing field, \" and \" mine slaughter \" and featuring graphic photos, reports reuters. \" it has happened in this country before where the apartheid regime treated black people like objects, \" wrote one newspaper in a front-page editorial. \" it is continuing in a different guise now. \" other critics blamed unions for the violence. South african president jacob zuma strongly condemned the violence, while avoiding direct criticism of the police. \" we believe there is enough space in our democratic order for any dispute to be resolved through dialogue without any breaches of the law or violence, \" said zuma, adding that he was \" shocked and dismayed at this senseless violence. \"",

        "summary": "A louisiana school board meeting had on its agenda what appeared to be a fairly routine contract approval for the district's superintendent. But the monday evening meeting ended up in the arrest of kaplan middle school english teacher deyshia hargrave after she juxtaposed jerome puyau's new contract, which includes a $ 30,000 raise, with the topic of teacher salaries and raises, nbc news reports. In a video of the meeting, which was first posted on katc, hargrave calls the raise, puyau's first since he became superintendent in 2013, a \" slap in the face, \" noting that raises and pay should be discussed for \" teachers, … cafeteria workers [ and ] other support staff. \" she continues even after a board member tells her her point is not \" germane \" to the conversation, at which point a city marshal hired to provide security comes over and asks her to leave. \" i hope somebody has this on video, \" one spectator can be heard saying as the marshal tells hargrave he ' ll remove her. She then picks up her purse and walks out, but a minute or so later, there are loud words in the hall and hargrave is seen on the floor, yelling and being handcuffed. She was booked into city jail on charges of staying after being forbidden and resisting arrest and released on bond. Board president anthony fontana tells katc the whole thing was a \" setup \" and that the marshal performed his duties properly. One of the board members tells the ap that women who've spoken up at previous meetings have been removed, but not men — a claim backed by the board's other female member. The ap notes the school board's offices were locked down tuesday after death threats in response to the video of hargrave's arrest. The teacher's union and the aclu are looking into the incident.",

        "summary": "A family of animals ruled the skies some 90 million years ago, but they weren't dinosaurs, and they weren't birds, and they didn't even have teeth. The winged reptiles of the late cretaceous period belong to a family of pterosaurs called azhdarchidae, and they appear to have had remarkable dominance for tens of millions of years, right up until dinosaurs also went extinct 66 million years ago, reports the los angeles times, citing a new study in the journal zookeys. ( the name comes from the persian word for dragon, azdarha, notes nature world news. ) the pterosaurs are extremely difficult to study, with only a few fossils found mostly in sedimentary deposits, according to a posting at eureka alert. The animals ' bones were so thin and fragile that skeletal remains tend to be shattered and scrambled. The new study reassessed previous fossil research, concluding that the creatures played a pivotal role in the ecosystem of their day. Because pterosaurs are believed to be the first animals after insects to fly, understanding the gigantic predators could help scientists gain insights into the mechanics of early flight. ( this ancient flying reptile had a head like a butterfly. )",

Ceo heather bresch testified to that fact in front of the house government oversight committee last wednesday, as one disbelieving congressman flat-out asked, \" is that the truth? \" not precisely, reports the wall street journal. Mylan tells the paper ( and told the committee on monday via more detailed financials ) bresch's figure was a post-tax one, meaning the profit is actually 60 % higher at $ 160. The pharmaceutical company says the statutory us tax rate of 37.5 % was slapped on, though neither bresch nor a poster she had brought with her detailing per-pack revenue mentioned taxes. A heath-care analyst who spoke to the journal puts mylan's 2015 overall tax rate at 7.4 %, and its us tax rate at basically zero. How a usc law and business professor reacted to the news in comments to the los angeles times: \" it is intellectually dishonest to include tax provisions for us taxes that aren't due, and that the company does not in fact anticipate ever having to pay. \" mylan defended its math in a statement, per cnbc, that says \" tax is typically included in a standard profitability analysis \" and that \" just as we did not use a blended global tax rate, we also did not allocate corporate expenses associated with running the business, which would have further reduced its profitability. \" it called its approach the \" most appropriate, and conservative \" one.",

They've shed 100 obsolete or unneeded lighthouses in 14 years, 68 of them freebies handed off to preservation groups and the other 36 sold at auction. The agency handling the lighthouse purging has no target number to sell or give away, but the us coast guard wants to retire 71 considered \" no longer critical \" to its mission, says a spokesman. Don't feel bad for the iconic historic structures — the easily accessible ones get a second life as museums, private homes, or bed-and-breakfasts. The ones needing some tlc or cut off from civilization, however, generally languish on the auction block. By finding new \" stewards \" for their lighthouses, the government says it's ensuring their preservation. Public groups or nonprofits can apply to get one, and if no one is interested the lighthouse goes to auction, the agency explains. That's how dave waller got the graves island light station in boston harbor for nearly $ 1 million, and art girard bought the tallest lighthouse in new england ( maine's boon island light station ) for $ 78,000, reports the ap.

It all started on wednesday's show, when host stephen colbert made fun of the owner of the controversially-named washington redskins for starting a charity called \" washington redskins original americans foundation. \" colbert said he was inspired by the move, because of a \" so-called offensive \" character he sometimes plays, \" ching-chong ding-dong. \" ( mediaite notes that colbert has used the character \" to rip rush limbaugh's mocking attempt at speaking chinese. \" ) \" i am willing to show the asian community that i care, \" colbert said on wednesday, \" by introducing the ching-chong ding-dong foundation for sensitivity to orientals or whatever. \" the colbert report account tweeted out that quote nearly verbatim, but out of context from the rest of the satirical segment, and the backlash was fierce: sample tweet: \" #cancelcolbert because racism [ couched ] as satire is not a ' joke ' it's harm at the expense of marginalized people. \" the colbert report account quickly deleted the tweet and clarified, \" for the record @colbertreport is not controlled by stephen colbert or his show.... This is a comedy central account, with no oversight from stephen/show. \" colbert weighed in this morning from his own account: \" #cancelcolbert - i agree! just saw @colbertreport tweet. I share your rage. Who is that, though? i ' m @stephenathome. \" on mediaite, josh feldman writes that the character colbert plays on his show \" is purposefully ignorant....

            "Webb's most consistent message — as a writer, in the senate, during his recent campaign — has involved duty, loyalty, and the respect owed to those who serve. In the senate, he was also a very early champion of the cause of decarceration and criminal justice reform. If you wanted an antidote to what i have called chickenhawk nation — a country always at war, most of whose citizens are untouched by war — you would find it in the webb family. Many of its members have fought and thus are careful rather than cavalier about the causes for which they would send others to fight. Former senator jim webb, whom i've considered a friend since the late 1970s, is about the most independent-minded person i've ever met. That is part of what makes his writing so distinctive and sharp. Thus it seems natural, almost fated, rather than disorienting or disturbing that he would contemplate an independent run for president, rather than continuing as a democrat. Senator webb's son, writing as jim webb, contributed a powerful op-ed to the wapo defending his father against those who mocked his debate statement that the enemy he was proudest of making was the vietcong soldier who tried to kill him ( and whom webb killed instead ).

Her friend's stepfather, annoyed that he had to ask cindy twice to get off her phone, unleashed an air horn into her ears. Nothing has been the same for cindy since, people reports in a heartbreaking look at a rare hearing disorder called hyperacusis. \"overexposure to sound does not always lead to conventional hearing loss, \" one expert says. In cindy's case, it led to sounds that are too loud and near constant pain. \"when i hear a noise, i feel like i ' m being stabbed in the ear, \" cindy writes on her fundraising page. She also has a constant burning sensation in her ears. Treatment hasn't worked for cindy, and there is no cure for hyperacusis, also known as noise-induced pain. Noises — and pain — lurk everywhere. Cindy has been unable to return to school; she can't go to the store; and even her home is fraught with the possibility of dog barks and clanging pots. A recent attempt to hang out with friends ended when one of the girls squealed. \"cindy started sobbing from the pain, \" her mother, laurie redmond, says. \"her friends insisted she was faking. \" redmond adds: \" she cries herself to sleep. My heart breaks for her. \" cindy wears earplugs or protective earmuffs like you see on airport tarmacs, but those make it hard for her to communicate and don't block out sounds completely. Redmond says they need to find a cure to give her daughter a shot at a normal life. \" i worry that she has no friends, \" redmond says. \" i don't know how she's going to finish high school.

        "summary": "Ukraine's elite berkut anti-riot police unit has been disbanded by the country's acting interior minister after the unit was accused of brutality and blamed for the deaths of protesters. Arsen avakov said he will give more details about what will happen to the 4,000 to 5,000 officers today, the bbc reports. The berkut is just one \" much-despised \" law enforcement agency in the country; other security agencies have also been accused of human rights abuses. Meanwhile in ukraine: the whereabouts of ousted president viktor yanukovich are still unknown. In addition to the warrant that is out for his arrest, parliament voted yesterday to try him at the hague's international criminal court. A new cabinet is expected to be presented to protesters today. Meanwhile, acting president oleksandr turchinov announced he has taken on the duties of head of the armed forces. As part of the hunt for yanukovich, the us treasury yesterday asked banks to watch for suspicious financial transactions indicating he or his allies might be trying to transfer state assets, reuters reports. Tensions in ukraine are still high, particularly between pro-russia and anti-russia groups, and two rival protests are going on in crimea. Separatism or secession continues to be considered a serious threat. Russian president vladimir putin put troops in western russia on alert today, ordering a drill to ensure they're ready for combat, reuters reports. Yanukovich's opulent estate wasn't to be his only plush pad: the new york times reports that a \" pharaonic seaside retreat \" was being built for him in laspi on the crimean coast, in the middle of a supposedly protected forest with views of the black sea. The mansion was to be bigger than his presidential residence, with an indoor swimming pool and hot tub, thick walls and high ceilings, marble floors, and the like. But construction was halted after his ouster, since workers figured he'd never pay them. When elections are held on may 25, former boxing champ vitali klitchsko will be one of the presidential contenders, nbc news reports. Bank withdrawals peaked during the uprising, with as much as 7 % of deposits being taken out, and now ukraine is working to protect against a default, bloomberg reports.",

        "summary": "Danielle wright, 19, set off on a sailing adventure on may 29 aboard a 70-foot wooden sailboat called the nina. It left new zealand bound for australia with six others aboard, but the weather quickly turned bad. After a final text on june 4 stating that the sails had been shredded to bare poles, the boat was never heard from again. Its emergency beacon was never activated, leading new zealand officials to delay the search until june 25, when the boat didn't arrive in australia as scheduled; the search was suspended 12 days later. Wright's parents, however, are convinced the seven crewmates are adrift and surviving, the ap reports. They moved from their louisiana home to australia, where they've spent three months — and $ 600,000 of their own savings and donations — conducting their own search. They've commissioned private plane searches; ricky even got his own pilot's license so he could join in. The june 4 text was sent \" after [ the nina ] had passed through two storms, \" robin wright explained to the daily mail in an interview last month. \" in other words, somebody on the nina was still communicating after everyone was saying the yacht had sunk. \" the wrights also claim the official search aircraft could only detect metal objects, not wood, and they told the sydney morning herald earlier this month that the authorities refused to follow up on a satellite image from september that appears to show a yacht that could be the nina; new zealand says the military reviewed the image and determined it was simply foam from a wave. But for now, the search is ending for the wrights, who today told they ap they've run out of money and are returning home. They insist they won't give up hope until a full year has passed since the boat's disappearance.",

        "summary": "As new yorkers pick up the pieces in sandy's wake, they're tearing something else to pieces: the city's plan to hold sunday's new york city marathon as scheduled. Outrage has been growing since mayor bloomberg's green-light announcement on wednesday. Here's why: the starting point: as the atlantic wire explains, the race is slotted to kick off in staten island, which has been particularly hard-hit and is dealing with some pretty awful tragedies. \" we are still taking people out of the water and we're supposed to spruce up the parks for a race? \" rep. Michael grimm told the staten island advance. The resource shift: \" to take one resource, one police officer to supervise a stupid marathon is a slap in the face to the borough, \" assemblywoman nicole malliotakis told the advance. The new york post gripes that one generator that could be providing electricity to many homes \" sits idle waiting to power a media center \" during the race. What some critics want: the race to be held in the spring instead; they've started a petition to that effect. The argument for going ahead with it: it is a money maker, explains the ap. The city itself should benefit from about $ 340 million in race-related spending. And organizers plan to use the race as a launchpad for seeking donations; they plan to pony up $ 1 million for recovery efforts, and have gotten race sponsors to promise another $ 1.5 million. The hero: one staten island hotel owner is being praised for his decision to refuse to boot displaced locals who sought refuge in his hotel in order to honor marathon reservations. Richard nicotra tells ny1, \" how do i tell people that have no place to go, that have no home, that have no heat, that you have to leave because i need to make room for somebody that wants to run that marathon? \"",

The lawsuit, which also claims intentional infliction of emotional distress and conspiracy, was filed against the hollywood reporter by janice rooney; it also names her son from a previous marriage, mark aber, and his wife charlene, among others, as defendants. As deadline explains, the lawsuit stems from an oct. 2015 thr article headlined, \" tears and terror: the disturbing final years of mickey rooney. \" thr interviewed janice rooney for the piece, but the lawsuit claims the final product was \" deceiving \" and took her words \" out of context \" in a way that was meant to portray her negatively. Mickey rooney died in 2014 while under the care of mark and charlene aber; he had previously been cared for by mark's brother chris until he accused chris of elder abuse. A battle over his estate ensued after the actor's death, with janice rooney ( who separated from her husband in 2012 ) and chris aber challenging mickey rooney's will, in which he left all of his assets to mark aber. Rooney's eight biological children also contested the will. Janice rooney's lawsuit seems to stem from the overall family feud; in it, she accuses charlene aber of bringing \" false and humiliating allegations and innuendos \" against her to thr in order to get \" revenge \" against her, and in turn accuses the magazine of then essentially repeating those allegations in its article. The lawsuit notes that mickey rooney's lawsuit and restraining order against chris aber did not accuse janice rooney of elder abuse, but deadline states that janice rooney has been accused of physically abusing her husband during the ongoing family feud ( per the new york daily news, it was mickey rooney's attorney who accused her ); she says that's a misunderstanding.",

        "summary": "With a little time to reflect following hillary clinton's defeat in her bid for the white house, former campaign chair john podesta isn't pulling punches on her opponent. In an interview on politico podcast the global politico, podesta opened up about james comey's fate, his own hacked emails during the campaign, and most notably, president trump. Highlights: grading trump: podesta didn't hold back on his opinion of trump's white house. He characterized the administration as having \"no one who really stands up to [ trump ] \" and criticized the president's temperament: \"he's impetuous, he's impulsive, he fires things off, and, if anything, they enable him rather than trying to contain what are moves that in any other context would seem, you know, absolutely crazy. \" buyer's remorse: podesta said he thinks voters are regretting their decision to elect trump because \"every day, he proves that he is temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states. \" he also believes that american's were duped by trump: \"if you look at the way — what trump said he was going to do and what he's done, his emphasis on just taking care of the wealthy and powerful in office — that seems to me a fundamental lie that he made to the american voters. But you can lie to the american people. Sometimes you're rewarded for that. \" his email hack: podesta noted that his hacked emails began pouring onto wikileaks about 20 minutes after trump's damaging access hollywood tape was leaked, and said the email leak turned into \" fodder for fake news. \" citing pizzagate, he added, \"i think the russians were also active there. It wasn't just the hacking and the release of the information. It was the production and distribution, the trolling, the bots, the churn of fake news that was ostensibly coming out of the emails. \" comey's dismissal: he asserted that the white house's original reasoning for dismissing fbi director james comey was a \"complete misreading of reality. \" \"it's laughable, \" he said, \"really laughable that donald trump would fire jim comey because of his interference which damaged hillary clinton. I mean, it was laughable from the very beginning. \" he also said he and clinton never discussed whether she would fire comey should she win, but he predicts it would have been a \" tense relationship. \" owning up to loss: while podesta believes comey's october email surprise helped swing the election, he owned up to his role in losing: \"i think",

Martinez ( described by the lat as \" the scion of one of [ tampa's ] oldest and most prominent families \" ) and four daughters to show for it. But when the then-mitigation specialist with the public defender's office met oscar bolin on death row, everything changed. \" oscar came into my life and i thought,'this is bigger than anything i've ever done. I want to save his life, ' \" she told the associated press back in 1996, not long before she married the accused serial killer by speaker phone. Now, 18 years into a marriage that thanks to the logistics at hand has never been consummated, the husband and wife see each other twice a week at florida state prison in raiford, fla., reports abc news. Oscar has been on death row for decades after being found guilty of the 1986 murders of three young women, all of whom were found in the tampa area with multiple stab wounds. ( dna evidence confirmed that one of them died clutching a strand of bolin's hair, reports the tampa bay times. ) rosalie, who is now a private investigator, swears her husband is not guilty, and continues to file appeals in spite of multiple trials and convictions. \" i never, never, ever thought for a second that he was guilty of those three murders, \" rosalie tells \" 20/20. \" oscar did plead guilty to kidnapping and raping a woman at gunpoint 27 years ago, but rosalie says he \" did accept responsibility \" in that case. The bolins are currently busy preparing for two new hearings — one claiming another serial killer confessed to one of the murders and another questioning the merit of a discredited fbi agent's work.
