        "summary": "Us employers added a robust 261,000 jobs in october as the economy recovered from hurricanes that slammed the southeast in september, per the ap. The labor department says the unemployment rate declined to 4.1 %, the lowest in nearly 17 years, from 4.2 % in september. The burst of hiring ( though it was actually below estimates of 325,000, per the wall street journal ) mostly reflects a rebound from a trio of hurricanes that temporarily depressed job gains. But it also shows that for all their fury, the storms did not knock the economy off course. \" now that the storms have passed, the focus can return to the central question for the united states job market: with unemployment low, when will wage growth accelerate? \" writes ben casselman at the new york times. Average hourly earnings continue to rise at about 2.5 % year-over-year, below the annual rate economists would predict when unemployment is this low. Over the past three months, hiring has averaged 162,000. That is similar to the pace of hiring before the hurricanes. Employers added just 18,000 jobs in september, as thousands of businesses were forced to close. That figure was revised higher from a previous estimate that showed a loss of 33,000.",

        "summary": "In fashion, \" nude \" usually refers to a beige or peachy color. Christian louboutin is apparently among the first to realize that shade doesn't represent the skin tone of many. After introducing shoes in five nude shades last year, the designer has expanded the collection to include two new colors so that every woman can find her perfect match, per quartz. The shoes — ranging in shade from \" porcelain \" to \" rich chestnut \" to \" deep chocolate, \" all with louboutin's signature red sole — come in four styles, including flats, some of which are already sold out. Made of soft nappa leather, they're meant to feel like skin, according to an instagram post. You might have to sell some skin to afford them, though. The flats cost around $ 595 while the pumps sell for about $ 895. \" i've always done a nude shoe but only using the color beige, \" louboutin said in a blog post last year. Then a team member told him bluntly, \" beige is not the color of my skin. \" \" i have clients from every continent and want to make them happy! \" he added. \" they may ' only ' be shoes, but you're making a difference by designing and retailing inclusiveness and diversity, \" one fan writes on instagram, per mic.com, which notes designer björn borg recently unveiled six different shades of nude underwear. ( this one stat illustrates the fashion world's big diversity problem. )",

            "As a color, \"nude \" is often loaded with prejudice. In theory, it matches the wearer's skin color, which makes it easy to pair with just about anything. It's a wardrobe staple, and therefore a commercial staple for most shoe brands. But in practice, it commonly describes variations of beige with pinkish undertones, which is only \"nude \" for a certain sliver of the world's population. Christian louboutin, maker of some of the globe's most-coveted, high-end footwear, has been challenging that notion. Last year the company expanded its nude palette to five different shades. With its spring collection, it has added two more. The brand's new ad campaign shows off the new range, but as importantly, the move shows why diversity behind the scenes matters. Louboutin explained his decision to expand the nude range in a blog post last year. \"i've always done a nude shoe but only using the color beige, \" he said. It wasn't until a team member bluntly stated \"beige is not the colour of my skin \" that he recognized \"nude \" should be a concept rather than a single shade. The heels louboutin now offers because of that realization range from \"porcelain \" to \"deep chocolate, \" as the brand describes them on its instagram page. There are a few styles available, costing $ 675 or $ 875. As mic reported, a number of louboutin's instagram followers expressed gratitude for the inclusive approach.

They may 'only ' be shoes but you're making a difference by designing and retailing inclusiveness and diversity. \" in runways to magazine covers, fashion still lags in representing a range of races and ethnicities. There are various reasons why, but one recurring argument is that there aren't enough people of color being hired behind the scenes, where decisions are made. As for the new nude, the idea may be spreading, if slowly. Underwear brand björn borg — yes, from the tennis legend — recently launched a collection featuring six different nude shades.

The disclosure underlines the importance of the us spy hub at raf menwith hill in harrogate, north yorkshire, where hundreds of nsa analysts are based, working alongside liaison officers from gchq. The document was drafted in august 2009, four months after the visit by medvedev, who joined other world leaders in london, including the us president, barack obama, for the event hosted by the british prime minister, gordon brown.

The revelation comes as britain prepares to host another summit on monday – for the g8 nations, all of whom attended the 2009 meetings which were the object of the systematic spying. It is likely to lead to some tension among visiting delegates who will want the prime minister to explain whether they were targets in 2009 and whether the exercise is to be repeated this week. The disclosure raises new questions about the boundaries of surveillance by gchq and its american sister organisation, the national security agency, whose access to phone records and internet data has been defended as necessary in the fight against terrorism and serious crime. The g20 spying appears to have been organised for the more mundane purpose of securing an advantage in meetings. Named targets include long-standing allies such as south africa and turkey. There have often been rumours of this kind of espionage at international conferences, but it is highly unusual for hard evidence to confirm it and spell out the detail.

Some delegates were tricked into using internet cafes which had been set up by british intelligence agencies to read their email traffic. The revelation comes as britain prepares to host another summit on monday – for the g8 nations, all of whom attended the 2009 meetings which were the object of the systematic spying. It is likely to lead to some tension among visiting delegates who will want the prime minister to explain whether they were targets in 2009 and whether the exercise is to be repeated this week. The disclosure raises new questions about the boundaries of surveillance by gchq and its american sister organisation, the national security agency, whose access to phone records and internet data has been defended as necessary in the fight against terrorism and serious crime. The g20 spying appears to have been organised for the more mundane purpose of securing an advantage in meetings. Named targets include long-standing allies such as south africa and turkey. There have often been rumours of this kind of espionage at international conferences, but it is highly unusual for hard evidence to confirm it and spell out the detail. The evidence is contained in documents –"

In the wall street journal, thomas hazlett recalls the initial condemnation of the iphone by some — including a law professor who called it the \" iphony, \" only to give in and buy one in 2008. Clearly the iphone survived, and thrived, after those attacks, and \" the novelty has not worn thin \" since. Consumers are still eating the phones up, as evidenced by this staggering stat: while apple sells only 9 % of all cellphones, it accounts for a whopping 73 % of profits in the industry. Another amazing stat, from cnet: a new, appropriately timed, study shows that total iphone revenue has hit $ 150 billion, and 250 million of the gadgets have sold, confirming that it \" has been a sales juggernaut since its launch, \" writes don reisinger.",

Unlike most other jews, he asked forgiveness from millions of people — not just for his personal mistakes, but also for his social media platform. \" for those i hurt this year, i ask forgiveness and i will try to be better, \" he wrote in a saturday evening facebook post. \" for the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together, i ask forgiveness and i will work to do better. \" vanity fair notes that his head-hanging is \" vague, \" but that \" it looks like his yom kippur confession is an apology for enabling trump \" — meaning zuckerberg probably was referencing the ways tech companies like facebook and twitter contributed to the \" fake news \" phenomenon and perhaps had an impact on the election. Vanity fair notes zuckerberg's mea culpa also shows he's ready to come clean on the role facebook may have played, including initially being dismissive of fake-news warnings and unwittingly enabling russian interference efforts via thousands of divisive ads. The magazine also holds his feet to the fire, asking, \" what does it mean when he says he will ' work to do better,'though?, \" wondering if that means he ' ll be \" less laissez-faire \" about such issues. Josh constine at techcrunch concurs, noting that while he believes zuckerberg's apology was \" genuine, \" it may also be seen as politicizing the holiday and trying to fend off criticism ( of which he lists a couple of scathing examples ). \" the path forward isn't through faux-neutrality or forgiveness, but clear admission of malfeasance and demonstrable change, \" constine writes.

And now it turns out it may actually cost even more millions than originally thought: officials who spoke anonymously to the ap, abc news, and cnbc say the latest preliminary estimate is $ 92 million, up from an original estimate of $ 10 million to $ 30 million. The officials say about $ 50 million of that is pentagon costs including aircraft, equipment, personnel, and other support and the rest is largely related to security costs. But the estimates have not yet been finalized or released publicly, and defense secretary jim mattis has yet to approve parade plans; at least one official warns that, depending on the scope of the plans mattis signs off on, the cost estimate could change. The defense bill trump signed this week authorized the november parade.",

Per degrasse tyson, \" afterwards, she came into my office to told me she was creeped out... She viewed the invite as an attempt to seduce her... At that last meeting in my office, i apologized profusely. She accepted the apology.... I note that her final gesture to me was the offer of a hug, which i accepted as a parting friend. \" in conclusion: \" accusations can damage a reputation and a marriage. Sometimes irreversibly.

        "summary": "Global-warming skeptics, en garde: a new study says that the recent pause in global warming is caused by strong trade winds in the pacific ocean that will eventually subside, the guardian reports. According to the study, sharply higher winds in the central and eastern parts of the pacific have pushed surface heat underwater and lowered the amount of heat that rises into the atmosphere. This accounts for the lowering of global surface temperatures by 0.2 to 0.4 degrees fahrenheit since 2001 — a change that skeptics pointed out in a wall street journal letter two years ago. In the study, australian and us scientists say the higher winds could keep up for much of this decade but will calm down in time. \" even if the winds accelerate even further, sooner or later the impact of greenhouse gases will overwhelm the effect, \" said lead researcher matthew england. \" and if the winds relax, the heat will come out quickly. \" what caused the higher winds isn't clear, but warming in the indian ocean could be behind it. Meanwhile, the percentage of americans who deny climate change entirely rose by 7 % to 23 % last year, and the number who say it is caused by humans has dropped, the financial times reports.",

A joint australian and us study analysed why the rise in the earth's global average surface temperature has slowed since 2001, after rapidly increasing from the 1970s. The research shows that sharply accelerating trade winds in central and eastern areas of the pacific have driven warm surface water to the ocean's depths, reducing the amount of heat that flows into the atmosphere. In turn, the lowering of sea surface temperatures in the pacific triggers further cooling in other regions. The study, which is published in the journal nature climate change, calculated the net cooling effect on global average surface temperatures as between 0.1c and 0.2c ( 0.2-0.4f ), accounting for much of the hiatus in surface warming. The study's authors said there has been a 0.2c gap between models used to predict warming and actual observed warming since 2001.

These easterly winds, which blow across the tropics, have speeded up ocean circulation at the equator, pushing heat deep down into the ocean's depths and bringing cooler water up to the surface. This has driven more cooling in other regions and accounts for much of the reason why global average air surface temperatures have stayed virtually steady since 2001, says the paper, published in this week's nature climate change journal.

Jennifer aniston is a lovely person, a beautiful woman and a talented actress who causes a frenzy wherever she goes - but this week she hit out at speculation about her womb inferred from photos that run of her that are not digitally altered i've been in numerous beverly hills restaurants when she's walked in, and watched as every table descended into an instant frenzy of elbow-nudging and staged whispers. I suspect the same thing happens wherever she dines in the world. We all have an opinion on jennifer aniston and these opinions have been fuelled by the fact she hates talking about her private life and rarely gives much away. The less she reveals, the more we all love to guess: who's she dating? where's she living? what's she eating? and more recently, that burning question which confronts any newly-married woman: 'is she pregnant? aniston, newly married for a second time, is understandably asked about children - as most newly married woman are. Asking when a woman is not is one of the worst clangers well yesterday, jennifer finally had enough and let rip at all the gossip-mongers in an impassioned outburst. 'i ' m not pregnant!'she raged. 'what i am is fed up. ' on that specific point, i have great sympathy with her. There can be few things more distressing for a woman than for people to look at you and mistakenly query if you're pregnant. The unspoken implication is obvious",

The culprit: highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls, or pcbs. \" despite a near-global ban of pcbs more than 30 years ago, the world's killer whales illustrate the troubling persistence of this chemical class, \" reads the study in science. Most pcbs, which were used in everything from plastics to paint, have not been destroyed or securely stored, reports the bbc, and those that already leached into the ocean are unrecoverable and stubbornly persist in the whales, who metabolize them incredibly slowly, reports the new york times. Pcb concentration rises as you climb the food chain. Killer whales are at the top, leaving them with levels than can be 100 times what's considered safe and making them \" the most contaminated animals on the planet, \" as the guardian puts it. Newborn calves are heavily dosed with pcbs via milk, and even birthing newborns may be compromised: science daily reports researchers evaluated the pcb levels of more than 350 orcas and detected pcb levels of 1300 milligrams per kilo in some whales ' blubber; other studies have shown animals with levels of just 50 milligrams can exhibit infertility and immune system issues. The most contaminated, and therefore threatened, populations are those near brazil, the uk, and the strait of gibraltar. \" in these areas, we rarely observe newborn killer whales, \" says a study co-author.

        "summary": "Three suspects are now in custody after the killing of five police officers during a protest thursday night, and a fourth suspect is still exchanging fire with police, dallas police chief david brown says. The chief says the suspect has told negotiators he plans to hurt more officers and has planted bombs all over the area, the ap reports. He says the suspects in custody include a woman who was arrested in the same parking garage where the standoff continues. Another two suspects were taken into custody after police stopped their vehicle. Brown told reporters early friday that the officers were killed by shooters with rifles who were working together and that it's not clear whether there are more suspects out there, the dallas morning news reports. In other developments: a \" person of interest \" whose photo was tweeted by dallas police turned himself in and was released after it was determined he had no connection to the shootings, the guardian reports. Police announced around 2am that another officer had died from his injuries, bringing the death toll to five, with another six officers injured. Clay jenkins, dallas county's chief executive, says the shooters ' motives are unknown, apart from the fact that they fired on police, the new york times reports. Wfaa rounds up some videos posted on social media after the shootings, including one that shows marchers panicking as shots ring out. Rev. Dominique alexander, president of the next generation action network, tells the morning news that the protest was a call for justice after recent police shootings, but it was not organized by the black lives matter movement. He says he saw a photographer shot in the leg in front of him and was told that at least one of the shooters was white. A morning news op-ed calls the shootings terrorism that shattered a peaceful march. It was a \" well planned and barbaric attack on that peace. In purposely murdering police officers, these gunmen did not further any cause or make any kind of statement that civilized people can understand. They opened fire, literally, on human decency. \" reuters reports that other protests around the country remained peaceful, with crowds gathering in cities such as chicago, new york, and st.

        "summary": "It turns out mushrooms may be better for more than topping pizzas. Who knew? according to a study published wednesday, mushrooms may actually help produce the rain they need to live. Discovery reports researchers documented a previously unknown system in which rain makes mushrooms grow, mushrooms release spores into the atmosphere, and those spores create moisture droplets that could lead to rain. \"we can watch big water droplets grow as vapor condenses on ( the mushroom spore's ) surface, \" study author nicholas money tells discovery. \"nothing else works like this in nature. \" this process could be influencing climate patterns around the world, especially in fungus-heavy tropical forests like the amazon, gizmodo reports. According to gizmodo, a single mushroom can \" catapult \" up to 30,000 spores per second at speeds of up to 4mph. And it's been estimated mushrooms release 50 million tons of spores into the atmosphere every year. Using an electron microscope, researchers were able to watch water from humid air attach itself to those same spores to create cloud-forming particulates, discovery reports. \"sixteen-thousand species of mushrooms can do the same trick, so the most abundant species of fungi are likely to have the greatest effect upon cloud formation, \" money says. Unfortunately for california, money doesn't recommend growing mushrooms to fight droughts despite their potential rain-making abilities. \"nature works very well when we leave her alone, \" he tells discovery.

The new phone, expected to be called the iphone 6, will likely be offered in 4.7- and 5.5-inch versions, both of which are larger than the current generation's 4-inch screen. Manufacturers have apparently begun making such components as fingerprint sensors and chips for liquid-crystal drivers. Mass production of liquid crystal display panels will start as early as the april-june quarter at sharp's kameyama factory, japan display's mobara plant, and elsewhere, according to sources.

            "Tokyo -- suppliers of lcd panels for apple's new iphone will ramp up production soon, in line with a timetable for a worldwide launch as early as september. The new phone, expected to be called the iphone 6, will likely be offered in 4.7- and 5.5-inch versions, both of which are larger than the current generation's 4-inch screen. Manufacturers have apparently begun making such components as fingerprint sensors and chips for liquid-crystal drivers. Mass production of liquid crystal display panels will start as early as the april-june quarter at sharp's kameyama factory, japan display's mobara plant, and elsewhere, according to sources.

Jennifer joy logan, 32, of saskatoon, was at the canto luz rainforest retreat center when she died on jan. 17, the saskatoon star phoenix reports. Her family was told that staff at the center made a tea intended to induce vomiting, or purging, and give logan \" clarity on her future path. \" ( it's unclear if the purge was done in anticipation of drinking ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic drink that the center's website says it offers. ) the three women who drank the tea with her \" stopped vomiting within 15 minutes, \" logan's sister amy tells the canadian press. \" jennifer didn't stop and began to panic. \" she started convulsing and ultimately lost consciousness, her mother says; shaman assistants performed cpr and she and was taken, via motorcycle and boat, to a hospital about two hours away but died on the way. A statement from the center says logan drank a \" tobacco purge \" tea and had an \" extreme and unusual \" reaction to it. Police have not finished their investigation, but an autopsy found that she died from a pulmonary edema — a buildup of fluid in the lungs that can result in respiratory failure — and the family is having additional tests done to see if the tea was, in fact, to blame. As canada's global news reports, a pulmonary edema can be caused by ingesting toxins, as a weakened barrier between the lungs and blood vessels cause liquid from the latter to enter the former. Logan's mom and sister say the retreat staff, whom they met with in peru, is devastated. \" they were good people but something terrible, terribly went wrong, \" her mom says.

Hamlisch, the musical force behind \" the sting \" and numerous other movies and broadway shows, died in los angeles on monday, a family spokesman said. He collapsed following what was called \" a brief illness \". Details were not made public. Streisand, a friend of 45 years and star of romantic movie \" the way we were \", said she was \" devastated \" at his death and recalled how he had played at her 1998 wedding. \" when i think of him now, it was his brilliantly quick mind, his generosity and delicious sense of humor that made him a delight to be around...

            "Marvin hamlisch, the pulitzer prize-winning composer who imbued his movie and broadway scores with pizazz and panache and often found his songs in the upper reaches of the pop charts, died on monday in los angeles. He was 68 and lived in new york. He collapsed on monday after a brief illness, a family friend said. For a few years starting in 1973, mr. Hamlisch spent practically as much time accepting awards for his compositions as he did writing them. He is one of a handful of artists to win every major creative prize, some of them numerous times, including an oscar for \"the way we were \" ( 1973, shared with the lyricists marilyn and alan bergman ), a grammy as best new artist ( 1974 ), and a tony and a pulitzer for \"a chorus line \" ( 1975, shared with the lyricist edward kleban, the director michael bennett and the book writers james kirkwood jr. And nicholas dante ). All told, he won three oscars, four emmys and four grammys. His omnipresence on awards and talk shows made him one of the last in a line of celebrity composers that included henry mancini, burt bacharach and stephen sondheim. Mr. Hamlisch, bespectacled and somewhat gawky, could often appear to be the stereotypical music school nerd — in fact, at 7 he was the youngest"

Watching from the stands was 2010 champ brianna hendrickson, who retired from the competitive texting circuit with sore thumbs at the age of 15. She tells the los angeles times that rules for wise texters include not breaking up by text, getting out of people's way if you can't walk and text at the same time, and never texting while driving. The secret to prize-winning texting, she says, is using a rolling motion instead of poking at the keys.",

        "summary": "Orcas don't just wave and whistle. They also have the ability to mimic words like \" hello \" and \" bye bye, \" as one killer whale has just proven. After discovering orca pods with unique \" accents \" in their communications — which naturally come in the form of whistles, calls, and echolocation clicks — scientists began to suspect the sounds were learned socially, as with human language, reports the cbc. So an international team set out to discover if an orca could be taught to mimic human words. Wikie, a 14-year-old orca born in captivity at france's marineland aquarium, seemed an excellent candidate as she was previously taught to imitate her trainer's actions. In the end, six humans who listened to clips of her imitating \" hello, \" \" ah ha, \" \" one two three \" and a trainer's name, \" amy, \" were able to pick the words out, per the guardian. ( judge for yourself here. ) wikie is no master: the whale correctly imitated human speech in 14 % to 55 % of trials, depending on the words, and correctly imitated other sounds — like the blowing of a raspberry, the creaking of a door, and a wolf's howl, per live science — in 19 % to 100 % of trials. Still, study author jose abramson tells the cbc researchers were impressed because orcas vocalize by inflating air sacs in their nose and were thought to produce a more limited range of sounds than dolphins and belugas, which have previously imitated human sounds. \" we didn't have any idea that they could be capable of this, \" says abramson, whose research is published in proceedings of the royal society b. Study co-author josep call calls it \" the first evidence that killer whales may be learning sounds by vocal imitation \" which \" could be the basis of the dialects we observe in the wild. \"",

Call 911! i don't have a phone, \" apperson said, according to a witness. But zimmerman's lawyer tells a different tale. \" the man pulled up next to george yelling obscenities at him, \" and though zimmerman tried to drive away, \" the fellow followed him — followed him around the u-turn and then pulled up to him and shot at him, \" attorney don west tells cnn. Zimmerman sustained minor injuries, the ap notes. Police say they found two guns in apperson's car, with a used shell casing. They also recovered a gun from zimmerman and plan to search his car. Zimmerman and apperson have clashed before; in september, apperson told 911 dispatchers zimmerman had threatened his life while the two were driving, and a few days afterward, apperson said zimmerman's car was parked near his workplace. Outside of those incidents, nejame says, \" they do not have a relationship. \" a police spokeswoman said it wasn't clear yet whether charges would be filed, wesh reports.",

        "summary": "We all know what a shamrock looks like, but — speaking in scientific terms — just what is it? a clover? a wood sorrel? some other type of plant? unfortunately, there's no single answer: the shamrock is the stuff of legend, not science, the smithsonian reports. Over the centuries, a number of different plants have been called the \" true \" shamrock. It was identified with the clover in the 16th century ( and on wikipedia today ), but there are many types of clover. And in the 19th century, a london botanist insisted that a plant called the wood sorrel was the real shamrock. Near the end of that century, an amateur naturalist decided to investigate, asking people from across ireland to identify the \" real \" thing. The most popular responses were the yellow clover and the white clover, though the red clover and black medick were also called shamrocks. In the 1980s, a scientist tried the experiment again and got comparable results, with the yellow clover taking the top spot. And that's the one most often sold to tourists, the smithsonian notes. As for the significance of the shamrock, even that isn't quite clear: legend says that st. Patrick compared its three leaves to the holy trinity, but that story first appeared in writing centuries later. Regardless, you can take part in tradition by \" drowning the shamrock, \" the cleveland plain dealer reports: after wearing it on your lapel, place it in the night's final drink on st. Patrick's day. And if that's a pint of guinness, you ' ll be in good company, according to wallethub: some 13 million pints of the stuff will be downed in celebration.

Books aren't votes, and a map of book purchases can reflect curiosity as much as commitment, but we hope our 2012 election heat map will provide one way to follow the changing political conversation across the country during this election season. How do we calculate the red and blue percentages on our heat map? our 2012 election heat map colors each state according to the percentage of red and blue book purchases, based on shipping address, that have been made on amazon.com during the past 30 days. We take the top-selling political books on amazon.com and categorize them as \" red, \" \" blue, \" or neutral. We classify books as red or blue if they have a political leaning made evident in book promotion material and/or customer classification, such as tags. We compute percentages, updated daily, for each state and the us by comparing the 250 best-selling blue books during the time period against the 250 best-selling red books during the same time period, including new book launches. If the same book title has multiple formats ( paperback, kindle books and audible audio ), each format has a separate sales calculation. The list only includes"

She says ward had near-misses with three cars before colliding with one being driven by 29-year-old ryan folsom. Ward broke her leg; folsom was killed instantly. Ward was arrested tuesday after being released from the hospital. She faces charges of second-degree murder, three counts of attempted murder, three counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and one count of felony vandalism for damaging the median strip. \" ward made a choice that day.... Her choice was very selfish, \" bridgett says. \" her actions demonstrated a complete disregard for human life. \" she's being held on $ 1.5 million bail. Folsom, who played football and studied neuroscience at brigham young university, went to medical school at the university of texas. He had two children, ages 2 and 4, and his wife is pregnant with a third. More than $ 300,000 has been raised for folsom's family.",

He told authorities that when he returned from a camping trip in frigid temperatures with his children, susan was gone",

So now, forest rangers near pandharkawada are turning to a bottle of something they hope will make the tigress \" roll and cheek-rub \" and send her into \" absolute heaven. \" that would be calvin klein's obsession cologne, the latest weapon in the hunt for the tigress named t1, who has been eluding searchers for months, and who spurred a supreme court ruling last month allowing her to be killed if necessary, per the independent. The ck men's fragrance is being deployed because it's like catnip for some big cats, thanks to a compound called civetone, originally derived from a small mammal called the civet but now made artificially, per the new york times. \" whatever is in that, cats love it, \" a carnivore expert told scientific american a few years back. T1's apparent killing spree has been going on for at least two years, and it's been a violent one: victims have been dragged away by their necks and their flesh eaten in chunks. One of india's most well-known hunters says t1 has become more clever with each capture attempt, and that even though tigers don't typically eat humans, once they do, they often prefer the taste. T1 has now gone \" psycho, \" he adds. Still, some locals protest the plan to shoot and kill t1, per the times of india, with a petition begging to let her and her two cubs live. For now, the plan is to spritz the ck near camera traps, wait for t1 to show up, then try to tranquilize her or, if that fails, to kill her. ( a rare white tiger killed a zookeeper in japan. )",

Also, it seems that instead of being upset at his son, his dad lance perkins is instead upset at his credit card company and microsoft, going as far as to swear off microsoft consoles for good. According to perkins, when he contacted microsoft, they replied by saying that the bill will stand. However perkins appealed and said that his son is a minor, in which they stated that they will look into it, but to date, they have yet to respond to perkins ' appeal. He says, \"until i actually hear from them, it's actually very discouraging. \" as for his credit card company, when he told them the situation, they said that there is nothing they can do unless he decides to charge his son with fraud.

        "summary": "Remember the heartbleed bug that made the internet a sitting duck for hackers? we're now experiencing another security breach that's as bad or worse, reports cnet. One weird aspect, at least to laymen: the flaw has been around for 22 years but went unnoticed until this week. Known as \" shellshock, \" the bug affects a piece of software called bash that's built into 70 % of machines connected to the web, the new york times reports. That includes macs and pcs with linux and unix operating systems. An apple statement to cnet says the \" vast majority \" of users of its os x operating system were not at risk. Ars technica, meanwhile, explains how to determine if a linux or unix system is vulnerable. In theory, hackers could exploit a weakness in bash that would allow them to take over an operating system and grab personal data, rather than just steal passwords. The national institute of standards and technology gives it a 10 out of 10 for severity, and though the makers of linux released a patch with news of the bug wednesday, it now says the patch can be circumvented, wired reports. \" the number of systems needing to be patched, but which won't be, is much larger than heartbleed, \" security expert robert graham writes at errata security. The bug is already being exploited, writes wired's andy greenberg: \" the shellshock attacks are being used to infect thousands of machines with malware designed to make them part of a botnet of computers that obey hackers ' commands. \" and it's likely to get much worse: soon, hackers will transform the bug into a worm \" to scan for more bash bug servers and install itself, \" says another expert. \" that's definitely going to happen. \"",

Now the guardian reports that the 29-year-old is on the short list to land a plum position in the industry: as editor of vanity fair. It is by no means a done deal, and farrow reportedly isn't the frontrunner to replace graydon carter, who announced last month that he was stepping down after a 25-year run. The favorite is actually janice min of guggenheim media, who was previously editor of the hollywood reporter, writes edward helmore. But farrow, son of woody allen and mia farrow, has the backing of new yorker editor david remnick, who ran farrow's piece on weinstein. In fact, the weinstein scandal is factoring into the hunt for a new editor by parent company conde nast, writes helmore. \"if publishing companies and media organizations are not thinking about these issues as they pick new top leaders, then they're making a significant mistake, \" says the npr's david folkenflik, who adds that \" anybody naming a new executive who do not have women finalists, should probably reopen their process. \" meanwhile, the new york post reports that jess cagle is the \" dark horse \" in the competition.

Per nbc news, webb's lawyers say that after 20 years of on-again, off-again lobbying, the state has finally agreed to compensate him under the tort claims act passed there in 2003, which caps payback for the wrongly imprisoned at that amount. The national registry of exonerations tells webb's story, which began in march 1982 with the rape of a university of oklahoma student, for which webb was ultimately convicted in 1983 and sentenced to 60 years in prison after the victim mistakenly ided him in a lineup. In 1996, dna testing proved webb wasn't the rapist, and after a new trial, the charges were dropped and he was released. His fight for compensation took many swerves, and he struggled with drugs, homelessness, and his marriage ( he eventually divorced ). But webb then found his current lawyer, who persistently pushed his case, and the state ag who took over for scott pruitt when he left to head trump's epa finally signed off on payment. In an nbc news story last year, webb revealed he's since become friendly with his accuser, who has apologized for her mistake, and that they still meet for lunch. \" he is a good man, \" she told nbc, which takes an in-depth look at their emotional meeting 32 years after she first faced him in a courtroom.

The york daily record spoke to tanya saylor about what she and her family — particularly her two teen daughters, whose bedroom shares a wall with warfel's bedroom — allegedly endured: not just loud music, but racist comments. And the sex. Saylor claims warfel would describe what was happening so loudly her girls could hear. She says she'd hand her daughters headphones to wear as they went to bed. Saylor tells the york dispatch that \" we gave her a full year of trying to do it the right way, \" meaning that rather than involve the authorities, she tried talking to warfel and her grandmother, to no avail. Things crescendoed in january, when saylor's eldest daughter needed to spend 10 days isolated in her room following cancer treatment. Warfel had sex \" nonstop, making sure that my daughter heard, \" saylor says. Police were called feb. 17 and feb. 28, reports cbs21 news, and again in march. In april warfel pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and harassment charges in connection with the feb. 28 incident and was sentenced to 45 to 90 days. The record reports that warfel is due to be released from york county prison on june 20; she still faces charges related to the march 21 case.
