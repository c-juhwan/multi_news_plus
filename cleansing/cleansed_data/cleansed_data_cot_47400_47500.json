The two countries have been closely linked for decades and syria hosts russia's only naval base outside the former soviet union, the independent notes. The evidence is mounting as to how brutal syria's crackdown on the year-old uprising has been: in a report out today, amnesty international found that assad's regime regularly tortures prisoners using sticks, rifle butts, cords, and sexual assault, reports the ap. In addition to the 7,500 estimated killed so far, the crackdown continues to claim dozens of lives daily and human rights groups say land mines have been planted along the routes refugees are using to flee the violence. Assad's forces have now recaptured most of idlib, a rebel stronghold near the border with turkey that had been held by hundreds of military defectors, the ap reports.",

The daughter of the airline's chairman, cho was found guilty of obstructing aviation safety after a dec. 5 incident in which she threw a tantrum and forced her taxiing plane to return to the gate at jfk airport so the chief flight attendant could be removed — all because cho was served macadamia nuts in a bag rather than on a dish, the bbc reports. \" human dignity was trampled upon, \" a judge said today, noting cho acted \" as if it was her own private plane. \" the judge added that cho, in custody since december, wasn't remorseful, and letters of apology submitted to the court describing her newfound humility didn't seem genuine. South koreans are taking no small amount of glee in the downfall of the scion of one of its \" chaebol, \" or family-controlled mega-businesses often run like personal empires, reports the ap. The chief flight attendant testified that cho became like \" a beast looking for her prey, grinding her teeth, yelling \" during the incident and made him and the attendant who served her apologize on their knees \" like slaves in a medieval era, \" the new york times reports. Prosecutors had asked for a three-year prison sentence based partly on additional charges of using her position to obstruct due process and assault with a service manual. The judge said cho's twins, under 2 years old, factored into the sentencing, reuters reports. Another korean air executive was sentenced to eight months in prison for pushing crew members to lie to investigators. ( the incident caused macadamia sales to surge. )",

Experts hired by led zeppelin contend both songs use notes that have been used in music for centuries. The attorney for wolfe's trustee, michael skidmore, praised the ruling, saying it brings his client one step closer to getting wolfe credit for helping create one of the most recognizable song introductions in rock history. Skidmore was able to overcome statutes of limitations because \" stairway to heaven \" was remastered and re-released in 2014. A jury trial is set for may 10 in los angeles.

( associated press ) los angeles ( ap ) — a trial is needed to determine if led zeppelin's \" stairway to heaven \" copies its opening notes from a song performed by the rock band spirit, a federal judge has ruled. U.s district judge r. Gary klausner ruled friday that lawyers for the trustee of late spirit guitarist randy wolfe had shown enough evidence to support a case that \" stairway to heaven \" copies music from the spirit song \" taurus. \" \" taurus \" was written by wolfe in either 1966 or 1967, years before led zeppelin released \" stairway to heaven \" in 1971. Klausner wrote that while the songs have some differences, lawyers for wolfe's trustee may be able to prove they are substantially similar. Led zeppelin and spirit performed at some concerts and festivals around the same time, but not on the same stage. Klausner wrote",

Kelly repeatedly clashed with trump and lost some west wing authority during his 17-month tenure, per cnn. A former marine corps general, kelly imposed discipline on a freewheeling white house but saw trump work around his who-gets-to-see-trump-when rules. Kelly also made his own problems, erupting in a profanity-laced exchange with national security adviser john bolton, engaging in a \" near brawl \" with informal trump adviser corey lewandowski, slamming rep. Frederica wilson with false information, and apparently mishandling the abuse scandal around ex-staff secretary rob porter. Kelly also denied reports that he'd called trump \" an idiot \" and considered himself \" the lone bulwark against catastrophe \" in trump's white house. Trump called kelly \" a great guy \" in announcing his departure.",

It's the third such incident in less than three months, the ap notes; just last week, three were killed at a station in xinjiang province. Neither the attackers nor their cause has been identified in the latest brutality, but reuters notes that there were at least two of them, and possibly four. The violence occurred at a train station in guangdong, capital of the guangzhou province, where police arrived with the attack under way. \" after verbal warnings were ineffective, police fired, hitting one male suspect holding a knife, and subdued him, \" police said. Police caught another suspect as he tried to escape, according to an official news daily. One victim was critically wounded, police say. The attackers were dressed in white, with white hats; their knives were 20 inches long, said a local report, via reuters. A store owner offered an eyewitness account: the attackers, he said, crouched on the ground for two hours near the shop as they covered their bags in clothes. Suddenly, they pulled knives from the bags and, with a yell, started hacking at victims. Recent similar attacks have been blamed on extremists in the far west of china, the ap notes.",

The reported strategy is for mcconnell to keep the senate in session all weekend and arrange a slew of votes that could put dems in a bad light, should they continually vote against things like the children's health insurance program. If a shutdown does kick in at midnight friday, the ap reports the impact would be evident but not paralyzing. Federal workers would be impacted and national parks could close, but essential things — social security payments, homeland security, the military, air traffic control, food inspection — would truck on.

It was \" always about tourism, so it doesn't have such a negative history, \" the director of one of the site's developers tells the guardian, which notes that since the property has been deemed historic, the german government is subsidizing sales.

But 25 years after the fall of the berlin wall, the complex nicknamed the colossus of prora is part of a growing debate in modern germany that pits commercialism against vergangenheitsbewältigung – the german word for how the country should come to terms with its dark past. Blocks of six-story buildings stretching for 4.5km went up before war slowed construction, leaving an unfinished hulk that was later retrofitted into training grounds and housing for east german soldiers. But a group of investors in this seaside town is now doing what the nazis never could: realising the site's final stage of transformation into a vacation wonderland. Large parts of the complex are being gutted and rebuilt into developments, including one called new prora that will house luxury beachfront condominiums – half of which have been sold – as well as an upscale hotel and spa. But it's not just the cashing in on a major nazi landmark that troubles opponents. In a sense, some argue, the renovation is also fulfilling the third reich's initial plan to turn the colossus into a massive tourism hub. In promotional material, developers are praising the original project – whose design is believed to have been chosen by hitler – as a \"world-famous monument \" recognised in its day for \"award-winning architecture. \" critics say their plans also may wash away many of the elements that provided the reason for preserving the colossus in the first place. \"these are not harmless buildings, \" said jürgen rostock, co-founder for the prora documentation centre. \"the original purpose for hitler was the construction of ( a resort ) in preparation for the war to come.

But 25 years after the fall of the berlin wall, the complex nicknamed the colossus of prora is part of a growing debate in modern germany that pits commercialism against vergangenheitsbewältigung – the german word for how the country should come to terms with its dark past. Blocks of six-story buildings stretching for 4.5km went up before war slowed construction, leaving an unfinished hulk that was later retrofitted into training grounds and housing for east german soldiers. But a group of investors in this seaside town is now doing what the nazis never could: realising the site's final stage of transformation into a vacation wonderland. Large parts of the complex are being gutted and rebuilt into developments, including one called new prora that will house luxury beachfront condominiums – half of which have been sold – as well as an upscale hotel and spa. But it's not just the cashing in on a major nazi landmark that troubles opponents. In a sense, some argue, the renovation is also fulfilling the third reich's initial plan to turn the colossus into a massive tourism hub. In promotional material, developers are praising the original project – whose design is believed to have been chosen by hitler – as a \"world-famous monument \" recognised in its day for \"award-winning architecture. \" critics say their plans also may wash away many of the elements that provided the reason for preserving the colossus in the first place. \"these are not harmless buildings, \" said jürgen rostock, co-founder for the prora documentation centre. \"the original purpose for hitler was the construction of ( a resort ) in preparation for the war to come. This way of dealing with the building trivialises it and affirms the nazi regime. \" the facades of some blocks, for instance, are being brightened by dozens of quaint sea-facing balconies, changing the"

        "summary": "Four decades after the vietnam war, jim reischl still remembers how her long hair fell down her back that night in a bar in saigon. He remembers the drink he bought her — a cup of tea — and her name, linh hoa. He also remembers some of the last words she spoke to him before he shipped out in 1970 at age 21: \" she told me she was pregnant, \" he tells the washington post. Reischl, now 67, had been warned by his air force superiors that it could be a trap to get him to take the sex worker back to america with him, and he never found out if it was just a line, though he's returned to vietnam four times searching for an answer. Now in his golden years, he's one of several vets hoping to reunite with the women — and perhaps the children — they left behind in vietnam, sometimes after lengthy relationships, with help from volunteer website fatherfounded.org. The website connected reischl with a translator so he could place ads in local papers. He tried to find the apartment he shared with linh hoa and even underwent hypnosis in an attempt to remember the mailing address he threw away when she didn't respond to his letter. So far, he has no leads and only a faded old photograph he snapped from a cab. But \" i will never stop looking, \" reischl says. \" i want her to tell me whether it's true or not. Is there a child involved here? that's what i want to find out. \" some 100,000 children were born of american fathers in vietnam during the war, and 21,000 had moved to the us as of 2013, the new york times reported, but only around 5 % found their fathers. Hundreds still remain in vietnam today. \" we're at an age now we want to find out answers, \" another veteran says. \" it's been in the dark for so many years.

The controversial ban was put in place tuesday by the city council, three months after a 55-year-old montreal woman was killed by a neighbor's dog that entered her backyard ( possibly through a hole in the fence, the montreal gazette reported at the time ). The dog, which was shot and killed by police after it attacked one of the officers who responded to the scene, was originally reported to be a pit bull; however, authorities are still awaiting official dna test results to determine the dog's breed, and the humane society claimed in july that the dog was registered as a boxer. The vote came down 37-23 in favor of the ban, which had been decried by animal rights advocates and protested by pit bull supporters. \" this is very serious. It's not an object, it's not the right to seize a car — it's a right to take a member of your family and that should not ( be ) permitted, \" says one lawyer. But a city executive committee member argues, \" a montreal woman died because someone didn't have control of their dog. \" the ban will also include staffordshire terriers, any mix including a banned breed, and \" any dog that presents characteristics of one of those breeds. \" however, current owners can apply for a permit to be allowed to keep their pets.

The treasury unveiled its plans for the new $ 20, $ 10, and $ 5 bills wednesday, revealing that in addition to harriet tubman replacing andrew jackson on the front of the $ 20, suffragette and antislavery figures lucretia mott, sojourner truth, susan b. Anthony, elizabeth cady stanton, and alice paul will be on the new $ 10, which will keep alexander hamilton on the front. The new $ 5 will feature marian anderson and eleanor roosevelt on the back, as well as martin luther king jr. A roundup of coverage: andrew jackson will be moving to the back of the $ 20, but a lot of people want him gone altogether, reports nbc news, which notes that for some, replacing the slave-holding jackson with a former slave is \" perfect historical payback. \" the wall street journal contrasts the life stories of tubman and jackson, who fought to kill off the predecessor to the federal reserve. The new york times recaps the stories of all the new faces coming to us currency, including sojourner truth, who was best known for her 1851 \" ain't i a woman \" address. Cnn reports that ben carson has called for keeping jackson where he is on the $ 20 and putting tubman on the $ 2 bill instead. He didn't say what he wants to do with thomas jefferson, who's currently on the little-used bill. At the washington post, philip kennicott argues that the $ 20 should feature not the \" primly dressed \" and \" grandmotherly \" woman most images of tubman depict, but the \" ferociously brave and determined woman \" depicted holding a gun in what was a \" shockingly confrontational image \" at the time. Change for the $ 20 will take time: the redesigns won't be unveiled until 2020, the guardian reports. In a medium post, treasury secretary jack lew explains the changes and why tubman was chosen for the $ 20.",

Manchester-by-the-sea resident kyle waring tells boston.com that he got the idea for shipsnowyo.com while shoveling the stuff, and he's now sold more than 100 16.9-ounce bottles of genuine massachusetts snow for $ 19.99. Though the snow was treated with dry ice to lower its temp prior to shipping, many of the bottles melted long before they reached buyers around the country. But waring says he is now selling 6-pound packages in insulated containers for $ 89, which will reach the customer in 20 hours, with enough snow remaining to make up to 15 snowballs. So who's buying the stuff? waring says it \" seems to be corporations paying for the $ 90 product as a funny gesture, where the $ 20 one is regular consumers. \" he says there have been no complaints about snow melting in transit. \" they understand that we want to clean up boston, so even if it does arrive as water, they get a kick out of it, \" he told boston magazine earlier this month. His website stresses: \" we will not ship snow to any states in the northeast! we're in the business of expunging snow! \" ( the site's occasionally snarky tone — \" trapped in our tiny ass apartments and dealing with 3 hour long commutes...

Though crews have been working around the clock to deal with the tesoro corp.

While the nearest home was a half-mile away and the state said no water sources were contaminated and no wildlife hurt, one of the largest onshore oil spills recorded in the us serves for some as a cautionary example, especially given a recent pipeline break in belfield, about 150 miles south, and ongoing debates over the four-state dakota access pipeline. Texas-based company tesoro and federal regulators have said a lightning strike may have caused the 2013 rupture in the pipeline, which runs from tioga to a rail facility outside of columbus, near the canadian border. The cleanup has cost tesoro more than $ 49 million to date and is expected to top $ 60 million, according to recent filings to the state. Crews have had to dig as deep as 50 feet to remove hundreds of thousands of tons of oil-tainted soil, north dakota health department environmental scientist bill suess says. The company has now switched to special equipment that cooks hydrocarbons from crude-soaked soil in a process called thermal desorption before putting it back in place.

        "summary": "A new survey on modern slavery around the world pegs the number of people in the us who fall into that category at about 400,000, reports the guardian. The new global slavery index also puts the number worldwide at 40.3 million and rising. While modern slaves in the us make up just a fraction of that figure, the group behind the survey — the walk free foundation — says america plays a deeper role in the problem as the biggest importer of goods produced by suspected slave labor. The 2016 estimate was $ 144 billion worth of such goods. Other report highlights: worst offenders: north korea has the highest concentration of modern slaves, who account for 1 in 10 of the population, or 2.6 million people, reports cnn. Then comes eritrea, burundi, the central african republic, afghanistan, mauritania, south sudan, pakistan, cambodia, and iran. Women hit hardest: the vast majority of modern slaves, 71 %, are women, reports axios. The usual route is through forced marriages. Solutions: the foundation calls for outlawing forced marriages, setting a minimum marriage age of 18, setting up a database of human trafficking cases, and bringing greater transparency to the world's supply chain. One victim: \" over 40 million people... They are not numbers, \" says north korean defector yeon-mi park, who escaped to china only to be forced into a marriage, per the ap. \" it could be anyone. It was me. It was my mother. It was my sister. Even now, there are 300,000 north korean defectors in china, and 90 % of them are being trafficked.

The inventor of the plastic chalice known as the red solo cup, who lived in both illinois and arizona, died on dec. 21 at age 84, reports people. A death notice describes the devoted family man and father of 10 as a philanthropist, \" an innovator, a hands-on manufacturing expert, and an industry pioneer. \" after starting at his father's solo cup company at 18, hulseman worked his way up and is credited with inventing the famous party cup at some point in the 1970s. He also developed the traveler lid, which has been featured at the museum of modern art, notes the miami herald. Hulseman — who eventually rose to the position of ceo — is \" owed a debt of thanks by virtually every american ( and quite a few imbibers overseas ) for his now-ubiquitous invention, \" the red solo cup, with rings marking 1.5 ounces for liquor, 5 ounces for wine, and 12 ounces for beer, observes people. Before that product was introduced, the solo cup company had mostly focused on cone-shaped paper cups. The precise history is a bit iffy, but \" we know we were one of the first to introduce a party cup, \" a solo rep told slate in 2011. There may be competitors, but the red solo cup remains a staple, with tweaks along the way to provide for better stability during, say, enthusiastic beer-pong matches. ( more on the cup here. )",

Telling lies is a \" cardinal sin \" for lawyers, and \" the idea of someone so flagrantly telling untruths to ascend to the highest legal position in the us remains shocking, in addition to its being illegal, \" writes abramson.

That dylan observation can be found in the first chapter of journalist jonah lehrer's best-selling new book imagine: how creativity works, an exploration of how neuroscience explains creative genius. Lehrer has much to say on the matter, from a meditation on the inventor of the post-it note to an investigation into the way bob dylan's mind works, which included the quote above. The problem, though, is that there is no proof that dylan ever said this. Last month, lehrer was accused of a curious journalistic offense: the act of \"self-plagiarism. \" lehrer, a staff writer at the new yorker and celebrated author of three books, cannibalized his own work, posting often word-for-word excerpts from imagine on the new yorker's blog without noting that it had been published elsewhere.

        "summary": "Women hoping to become police officers in indonesia need to be strong, healthy — and should have an intact hymen, officials say, to determine whether or not they are moral. The revelation has sparked a new round of debates about women's rights in this highly conservative nation, the new york times reports. \" similar tests are not carried out for men because of differences in anatomy, but also because sociologically, it is women who are considered the symbol of purity, not men, \" says an independent state body on violence against women. Critics also say that the tests ( which involve a doctor inserting fingers inside a woman ) are discriminatory, traumatic, and inconclusive considering that hymens can be damaged by other means, like horseback riding or contact sports. A human rights watch report and video sparked the debate last month about such tests, which have been going on for 50 years or more under the radar. \" we don't know how widespread the practice is, and we don't know if it's nationwide, \" says an hrw researcher. \" but it's there.... The argument has been, ' we don't want prostitutes in the police force. ' \" a top police official tells the jakarta post that a failed virginity test only hurts a candidate's chances rather than disqualifying her, but a woman's rights activist says that's all the more reason to abolish the practice. Last year, an education official in indonesia proposed giving high-school girls virginity tests to thwart prostitution and promiscuity, but the notion was scrapped after widespread outrage on social media sites.",

On election day, voters shattered the obama agenda of expanded public benefits and increased income tax progressivity, leaving the president to reassemble his goals with glue and tape. During this midterm cycle, republicans became reacquainted with estranged friends: independents, seniors, college-educated voters, working-class voters, rural voters and suburban voters. The republican party will benefit from the infusion of diverse, attractive new leaders, including some, such as florida sen.-elect marco rubio, with tea party pedigrees. Most important, republicans have demonstrated that they are not a rump party confined to the states of the old confederacy, as even some republican strategists had begun to fear. The gop did solidify its hold on the south, but it was progress in states such as ohio and pennsylvania that raises republicans ' hopes for a competitive presidential season. The bible belt and the rust belt are the winning combination. But a high-water mark is also a kind of limit, showing where even the cresting floods do not reach.

            "The las vegas review-journal has a scoop on an unusual new government facility in the middle of the nevada desert. Eighty miles northwest of las vegas, and just south of a landscape pockmarked by nuclear weapons explosions, is area 6, a mysterious airfield with plenty of hangars but no visible airplanes. Located on land controlled by the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ), area 6 is also not far from the infamous area 51. A nnsa spokesman told the review-journal — apparently after months of \" fending off questions \" regarding the site — that area 6 is a place government agencies use to test the sensors onboard unmanned aerial vehicles. In other words, it's a drone proving ground. Advertisement - continue reading below according to a document filed by the giant multinational engineering corporation bechtel, area 6 is used to \" construct, operate, and test a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles. Tests include, but are not limited to, airframe modifications, sensor operation, and onboard computer development. A small, manned chase plane is used to track the unmanned aerial vehicles. \" the site is allegedly used to test sensors designed to detect nuclear radiation from both nuclear weapons and dirty bombs, as well as chemical weapons. An analyst from globalsecurity.org told the paper that the area 6 potentially could be used to test surveillance equipment",

According to tv station telesur, gomez and his cronies stole syringes and yellow fever vaccines from a vaccination center before forcing the two nurses to leave with them. They then took them to the salgueiro favela, or slum, where they were instructed to administer vaccinations over two hours. The nurses were then returned to their place of work. Brazil faced an outbreak of yellow fever, spread by infected mosquitoes, last year. And though government officials said it was over by september, more than half of 53 deaths from yellow fever since july occurred last month, per tech times. The nurses told local media the kidnappers weren't aggressive and had only the poor residents of salgueiro in mind because they didn't have access to vaccination centers. Former environment minister carlos minc went as far as to describe his latest act as a \" public service, \" per telesur. In another incident lending to his robin hood persona, gomez is said to have caused a riot last march after throwing bunches of cash to locals in salgueiro.",

It's not just a matter of getting a good night's sleep, however. Researchers at binghamton university say that when you go to sleep matters when it comes to fending off \" repetitive negative thinking, \" according to a post at eureka alert. While they don't specify bedtimes, the researchers say that people who are night owls and thus wake later in the day tend to obsess about their problems more than people who keep more regular sleeping hours, reports red orbit. \" making sure that sleep is obtained during the right time of day may be an inexpensive and easily disseminable intervention for individuals who are bothered by intrusive thoughts, \" says one of the researchers for the study published in cognitive therapy and research. The scientists can't say exactly why this is the case, but it might have something to do with the body's natural rhythms, explains a post at yahoo health. As the researcher explains, the brain might be better suited to handle \" high-level cognitive processes, like the ability to inhibit thoughts and images \" in the morning. ( another recent study reaffirms that about eight hours of sleep is optimal. )",

But researchers found locking lips may actually serve an evolutionary purpose: it helps us assess potential mates and weed out the lesser options, livescience reports. That explains why women ( who are pickier than men when it comes to mating ) and people who rate themselves as attractive ( who are also pickier ) said they found kissing more enjoyable and important than their male and/or less attractive counterparts, science daily reports. It also explains why women find kissing especially important when they're at their most fertile. One theory: kissing might transmit pheromones or chemical information — some of which can be transmitted through smell — about a partner's health, fertility, or genetic and immune compatibility. As one researcher says, \" it's just an excuse to get two people who are interested in each other close enough to have a sniff. \" says another, \" mate choice and courtship in humans... Involves a series of periods of assessments where people ask themselves,'shall i carry on deeper into this relationship? ' \" kissing can help answer that question.

Dickey initially agreed to pay $ 8.1 million in restitution, but as that would be \" like getting blood from a stone, \" per his attorney, he ' ll now make an initial payment of $ 100,000, then monthly payments of $ 500 for 20 years to help cover a $ 220,000 penalty after pleading guilty to a federal misdemeanor charge of causing a fire without a permit, per the star. Authorities say dickey — also sentenced to five years ' probation — immediately reported the fire, admitted to starting it, and cooperated with an investigation. The video of the incident, released monday by the us forest service on a request from the star, conceals the identities of two people who appear on camera, with an official citing privacy protection. ( a georgia man made the poor decision to shoot at a lawn mower filled with tannerite. )",

Longacre is 24, and will still be 24 when the miss america pageant is held in september — and she says she was told that as long as she was 24 during the miss america competition, her age was not an issue. But officials now say that according to the fine print, miss america can't turn 25 any time in 2014; longacre's birthday is in october, the smyrna-clayton sun-times explains. Longacre had no trouble while competing on the local level, and when she advanced to the state level, she says her age and birthday were clearly stated on her contract, which the miss delaware scholarship organization signed, she tells nbc philadelphia. The organization verified her birth certificate, license, and social security card before the competition. A media relations coordinator for the miss delaware organization even confirms that longacre didn't do anything wrong, and calls the whole thing \" a terrible mistake. \" after being told on tuesday she'd be losing her title ( plus prizes including $ 11,000 in scholarship money ), longacre says officials have been \" ignoring \" her. Making things worse: she had deferred her master's program and her department of justice internship for a year so that she could fulfill her miss delaware duties. Runner-up brittany lewis was crowned the new miss delaware last night, myfox philly reports.",

The government also says that gm will report safety issues faster in the future. The fine is the maximum allowed by law and a record at that, the detroit news reports, but it's only a fraction ( a hair under 1 % ) of the $ 3.8 billion gm made last year. The national highway traffic safety administration also ordered gm to implement \" significant and wide-ranging internal changes to its review of safety-related issues. \" the government boasted that the fine \" puts all manufacturers on notice that they will be held accountable \" if they fail to report defects — as gm allegedly did for at least a decade. Automakers are required to report safety defects within five days of discovering them. Gm's stock rose slightly on the announcement, bloomberg reports. The fine is the highest ever because the max fine has increased since toyota and ford were each fined $ 17.4 million in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Regulators have asked congress to drastically increase the cap to $ 300 million.",

The gunmen stormed the hotel on saturday evening, shooting at guests and detonating grenades. At least five people have been injured, officials said. It is not clear how many have been killed. The attack began at about 21: 00 local time ( 16: 30 gmt ), with reports suggesting the gunmen shot at security guards as they made their way into the five-storey building. They targeted staff and guests before special forces were called in. Security forces then cleared the ground floor of the luxury hotel but the attackers are still on the floors above, spokesman nasrat rahimi told the bbc. Some reports said the hotel had been hosting an it conference attended by provincial officials at the time. One witness told reuters news agency that the attackers had taken hostages. The attack comes just days after the us embassy in kabul issued a warning about hotels in the city. \" we are aware of reports that extremist groups may be planning an attack against hotels in kabul, \""

        "summary": "Climate change, sinkholes, human water use — the reasons are many, but the result is the same: lakes across the world have shrunk or disappeared completely, and in the smithsonian, sarah zielinski tells their stories. Among them: it's called the dead sea, but it's technically a lake, and it's been around for millennia. Thanks to water diverted to businesses and homes, however, the balance between water entering and evaporating from the lake has been thrown off. Now, it's getting shallower, at a rate of about a meter yearly — though officials are working on the problem. Lake waiau was seen by native hawaiians as a sacred spot. Just 10 feet deep at its deepest, it started disappearing in 2010, and as of september, it was just a pond, less than a foot deep. The reason for the phenomenon, which us officials call \" unprecedented in modern times, \" isn't known for certain; drought is among the possibilities. Florida's scott lake was the victim of a 2006 sinkhole; it was gone within two weeks, and it took some 32 tons of wildlife with it. The lake is slowly returning as clay and silt fill the sinkhole, but whether it will be back for good is an open question. Last year saw chile's lake cachet 2, in the andes, disappear in a night. The culprit here was climate change, which has caused the glacial lake's frequent disappearance and return. The colonia glacier holds lake cachet 2 in place; when melting thins the glacier, a tunnel allows the water to escape. Lake chad, which is found in cameroon, chad, niger, and nigeria, used to be the sixth-biggest lake in the world. Not anymore: some 90 % of its area is gone, thanks to a combination of familiar reasons — drought, human use, and climate change among them. That's caused a \" local lack of water, crop failures, livestock deaths, collapsed fisheries, soil salinity, and increasing poverty throughout the region, \" the un says. Images at discover magazine show the changing lake. Click for zielinski's full list.",

Local and federal authorities are pointing fingers at each other — but there's no dispute that brittany guerriero is the person who had to get her own justice. The men were free for months until december. Per the detroit free press, guerriero was moving into a new apartment in september 2014 when she was carjacked while waiting in the valet line. Thanks to surveillance camera tapes and guerriero's testimony, kendall kelly and demarcus catlin were captured, and each received sentences of nine to 20 years in prison on the carjacking charge ( kelly had other time added on for a fatal shooting ). But guerriero tells the detroit free press that she went online in november and found kelly and catlin had been released from federal prison. They were sent there first because their carjacking convictions in state court violated their probation. Kelly and catlin were supposed to go to a michigan prison last year to serve their carjacking sentences, but the us bureau of prisons says it wasn't told that the men were supposed to be transferred. A rep for the wayne county prosecutor's office says the snafu was the federal prison bureau's fault, but the feds deny any wrongdoing and say the proper detainer paperwork wasn't filed to alert them that the convicts shouldn't have been released. \" it shouldn't take some random victim looking through the system, \" guerriero says. \" who else have they accidentally released? \"",

Prince harry has flown back to london to an angry queen after the frisky party boy stripped in his las vegas hotel suite, and photos ended up in the us press, reports the new york daily news. The royal family was scrambling yesterday to do damage control, and contacted the press complaints commission in london in a bid to block publication of the shots — which appeared to be enough to keep them out of british newspapers, reports the bbc. Because the game of strip billiards took place in harry's $ 8,000-a-night vip suite, the 27-year-old prince had a reasonable expectation of privacy, and publication of the photos could be an illegal invasion of privacy under british law. It's not clear who took the photos of a naked harry cupping his genitals, and giving a nude young woman a bear hug. Tmz reportedly purchased the photos for $ 15,000. The antics have raised serious questions about harry's judgement and his ability to effectively serve as a representative of the queen, reports the telegraph. They've also hurt his image in the british military. He ' ll likely get a dressing down by superiors, and may be officially censured.

The reason? it shows the member posing with \" rick, \" whom he identified as the aide who follows trump everywhere and carries the nation's nuclear codes. The washington post first mentioned the posting by retired investor richard deagazio, who took it down after being asked about it. You can see the image at the daily caller, which also has wire-service photos that appear to show the same man following trump on different days, and he is indeed carrying a hefty briefcase. Assuming this is, in fact, the man with the fabled nuclear football, it's not exactly a state secret, notes gizmodo. After all, it's inevitable that he would show up in photos given that he's with the president constantly. The hill, though, frames the hubbub this way: the photos \" raise questions about the access enjoyed by mar-a-lago members, who have seen their annual membership fee double to $ 200,000 since trump won the presidency. \" on that front, both the original post story and another at cnn detail how trump and prime minister abe of japan were at dinner at the club when news broke of north korea's missile test. A line from cnn: \" the patio was lit only with candles and moonlight, so aides used the camera lights on their phones to help the stone-faced trump and abe read through the documents. \" they did so as guests sat nearby. \" wow.....

It was absolutely fantastic. \" if that sounds to you like the diary entry of charles manson and not a teenage girl, you'd be very wrong. It is that of pearl moen, now 19, who will serve 15 years in prison after taking a plea deal friday for stabbing a stranger 21 times on nov. 14, 2015. Moen goes on to describe the early morning attack, at a park near her home in austin, texas, as \" a high unlike any other — it feels like this crisp unreality, flashing and sparkling, adrenaline and shock, fight or flight mode. \" the victim survived, reports the austin american-statesman, and told police that her attacker was smiling. The victim tells kxan that her medical background as a nurse saved her life. She'd been relaxing on a blanket with a friend and closed her eyes when the friend went into an apartment; and seconds later she was attacked. She lost a lot of blood and suffered a collapsed right lung. \" i always thought she would walk around with guilt, but knowing she had this joy and this pride is very unsettling, \" she says. Kvue reports that moen made several drawings depicting the attack, which her mother found and gave to police. In march of 2016, kvue interviewed a former classmate of moen's, who expressed shock that a shy, sweet girl who'd left school to be homeschooled had turned so violent. Moen apparently fell in with a rough crowd and had a history of drug use and psychological issues, though no criminal record. ( america's smallest state capital is investigating a rare murder. )",

Police have declined to offer details of what happened, why polk was in epps ' home, or what a possible motive might be, but polk's son tells cbs san francisco that epps was married to polk's ex-wife. Polk was a registered sex offender and had a rap sheet dating back to 1995 that included drug offenses, domestic violence, attempted robbery, and auto theft, nbc bay area reports. A woman who came to epps ' home to mourn polk told the chronicle she had known him for 10 years and that he had fallen into drugs and homelessness after his mother, with whom he lived, died a decade ago. She says he would often show up uninvited at the home where he ultimately died, in which his two children still lived, and cause trouble. Residents at a nearby apartment complex say he had recently been evicted from an apartment there that was believed to be a drug den; the apartment's tenant filed for a restraining order against polk saying he had no right to live in there and had once gotten violent with him. Polk's son says his father insulted epps and they got into an argument prior to polk's shooting. Vic lee of abc 7 tweets that sources say the shooting may have been self-defense.",

The mexican leader had planned his first trip to the states since trump's election this month or next, but dropped his plans after trump refused to publicly acknowledge peña nieto's refusal to pay for the wall. Though peña nieto met in mexico with trump as a candidate, he canceled a planned january 2017 visit over trump's wall rhetoric, reports the ap. The post paints the two men as opposites, with the mexican leader \" a physically slight man, \" who is \" exceedingly formal \" and fond of \" carefully scripted public events. \" and with mexican presidential elections looming in july, he could be looking to make sure he avoids embarrassment for the sake of his party. \" the problem is that president trump has painted himself, president peña nieto, and the bilateral relationship into a corner, \" said arturo sarukhan, a former mexican ambassador to the us. \" the idea of mexico paying for the wall was never going to fly.

        "summary": "There's a term for that cold you're going to get when you take a few days off work this holiday season: leisure sickness. And, while there are no medical studies to confirm the phenomenon, a dutch psychologist published findings in 2002 that 3 % of 1,900 people polled did say they tended to get sick on weekends and vacations, quartz reports. Professor ad vingerhoets of tilburg university in the netherlands previously told the guardian that his own propensity for leisure sickness spurred him to conduct the study. His thoughts, and the reigning theory, hold that all the work stress leading up to a break compromises the immune system, and then once you're finally able to rest, all that stress catches up with you. But, as quartz points out, becoming ill on vacation likely has more to do with traveling than with taking time off work. \"whether influenza, the common cold, or other viruses, it's really quite clear that mass transportation contributes to transmission, \" william schaffner, professor of preventive medicine at vanderbilt university medical center, tells quartz. In our daily lives, we build up antibodies to fight the germs around us, but at an airport, we're exposed to new viruses from around the globe. Worse, many viruses spread more easily in crowded places like airports, and the relatively low humidity inside airplane cabins also help them to spread. There's also the fact that \" people [ probably ] remember illnesses during vacations better than those that occur during more regular work schedules, \" one psychology professor points out. The best way to avoid getting sick this holiday season, schaffner says: get a flu shot. ( this study predicts how often adults and kids will get the flu. )",

The $ 30 was for gas. \"it's insane, \" hatzi tells kgw. \"it's like a bad sitcom that nobody would ever buy the story because it's stupid and it makes no sense. \" apparently, keys for older subarus can be interchangeable, and that's what allowed hatzi's car to have what she calls \" a little adventure, \" the oregonian reports.

Smile of the child says it has heard from many parents whose children have gone missing, and it is following up around 10 promising leads, including at least four from the us, the guardian reports. The girl, who was discovered in the home of a couple with 13 other children, speaks only a roma dialect and is believed to be around four years old. The couple have been charged with kidnapping and police say they have given at least five different accounts of how the child came to be with them. The roma community where the girl was found has rallied around the couple, reports the bbc, but social workers suspect the girl was forced to beg in the streets and may have been sexually abused. The charity caring for her says she was \" filthy and terrified \" when they found her last week but her condition has improved and she is now out of the hospital and playing with other children. \" she was frightened and cried herself to sleep, \" the charity's director tells reuters. \" it has shaken everyone and has helped bring to light a major problem — just how easy it is to traffic children. \"",

The worker is one of 48 people wintering at the national science foundation's amundsen – scott south pole research station, and two planes have been sent from canada to carry out a very unusual and risky rescue mission, reports science. Only two other such rescues have been carried out in the 60 years the station has been operating and, until the evacuation of physician ron shemenski in 2001, it had been thought that the relentless cold and dark made it impossible to get people away from the south pole in winter, reports the washington post. Shemenski had pancreatitis and the nsf feared he would die. Two twin otter bush planes, each with a pilot, a co-pilot, an engineer, and a medic, are carrying out the mission, with one plane remaining at a british research station on the antarctic peninsula in case crew from the first plane need to be rescued. They hope to carry out the rescue by the middle of next week. ( you can track progress here. ) \" it's a 10-hour flight, and you only have 12 or 13 hours of fuel on board, \" pilot sean loutitt, who was chief pilot during the 2001 rescue mission, tells the post. \" you're monitoring the weather the whole time, but eventually you get to a point of no return. Then you're committed to the pole, no matter what. \" he also took part in a rescue in 2003, when a worker had a gall bladder infection.

If all goes well, one of the planes will arrive in 6 days to pick up a member of the winter-over crew suffering from an unspecified medical emergency that requires treatment at a hospital. Every february, after the scientists have left, a few dozen people hunker down to spend the long, dark austral winter at the amundsen – scott south pole research station operated by the national science foundation ( nsf ). Medical problems do occur, but most can be handled with medical personnel on site or in consultations with stateside doctors. The decision to evacuate someone is not made lightly because such a rescue operation is both dangerous and elaborate"

Rectal thermometers remain the \" gold standard \" for getting the most accurate reading, healthday news reports, even though \" it's no one's favorite method. \" for the study appearing in the journal annals of internal medicine, researchers examined 75 published studies, comprised of more than 8,600 patients total, that compared \" central \" thermometers ( i.e., either rectal ones or those that can get temps from a vein ) with \" peripheral \" ones — the kind we stick under our tongues, in our armpits and ears, and on our foreheads, stat notes. The results: rectal thermometers were \" highly accurate, \" while peripherals didn't perform as well, especially in detection of low-grade fevers and accuracy in measuring high-grade ones ( the study found ear and armpit thermometers could be up to two degrees off in either direction ). For most people with a minor cold, that isn't a big deal, lead author dr. Daniel niven tells stat. But when you're dealing with certain groups — including older patients, those with immunity issues, and patients with tumors — it's critical to use the most accurate thermometers that can pick up even the slightest fever, the study notes. The least-accurate instruments for temp-taking? armpit thermometers, niven says.

But, as will surprise no one who's woken up saturday morning feeling woozy only to hit the bars again saturday night, a new study finds that hangovers actually have very little impact on when we have our next drink. And not only do they not dissuade us from drinking more, it's also a myth that they encourage us to go for another drink in an attempt to relieve our pain, \" hair of the dog \" style. It should be noted, however, that the public health researchers arrived at these results by asking 386 us college students and other young adults — not, say, middle-aged people — to keep a drinking diary for three weeks, the bbc reports. Each morning, subjects reported whether they had a hangover and rated how likely they were to drink later that day, and researchers found that there was no difference in the ratings between mornings subjects had hangovers ( even bad ones ) and mornings they did not. ( amusing note: some diary entries were blank, perhaps because the subjects were too hung over to put pen to paper, the researchers theorize. ) however, researchers did then look at subjects ' actual drinking and found that having a hangover did delay the timing of the next drink... By six hours, from 38 hours to 44, livescience reports. \" the message here for clinicians is that it is probably a waste of time to discuss hangovers when trying to motivate a problem drinker to drink less or drink less often, \" says one expert, according to the star-ledger.

In a second now-deleted tweet, she wrote, \" i gather i have offended many by my last tweet. ' women are the... Etc ' is a quote from yoko ono from 1972, which i never forgot.

        "summary": "Diagnoses have just been made for patients who've been dead for thousands of years. Researchers digging in egypt have uncovered six cases of cancer among ancient egyptians, including a young child with leukemia, a middle-aged woman with a carcinoma — most likely ovarian, breast, or colorectal cancer — and a middle-aged man with a preserved tumor indicating rectal cancer, per live science and sciencealert. Based on those and three other cancer cases perhaps caused by the human papillomavirus ( hpv ), found among the remains of 1,087 egyptians buried 1,500 to 3,000 years ago in a cemetery in the dakhleh oasis, researchers say ancient residents had a 0.5 % risk of developing cancer during their lifetimes, compared to the \" 100 times greater \" risk of 50 % for people living in the west today. In most cases, researchers had to identify cancers based on bone damage, including holes left by tumors, and admit traces of disease could've long ago vanished. Still, the finding makes sense since ancient egyptians had significantly shorter life spans than modern humans ( which would affect lifetime cancer risk ) and \" the carcinogenic load in their past environments would have been considerably less carcinogenic than modern western societies, \" anthropologist el molto and doctor peter sheldrick write in the international journal of paleopathology. As three of the six cases occurred in people who died relatively young, in their 20s and 30s, the pair suspect hpv could be to blame. \" hpv is a confirmed cause of cancer of the uterine cervix and testes \" and \" both types of cancers peak in the young adult cohorts, \" write the authors, who found no evidence of cancer treatment.
