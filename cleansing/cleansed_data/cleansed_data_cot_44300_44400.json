        "summary": "President trump fired back at theresa may on wednesday after the british prime minister condemned his decision to retweet a far-right group's anti-muslim videos — but he started with the wrong theresa may. \" don't focus on me, focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom. We are doing just fine! \" trump tweeted at a twitter account belonging to a british woman named theresa scrivener, who has six followers and has tweeted nine times in eight years. Around 20 minutes later, he deleted the tweet and replaced it with one tagged with the british prime minister's official account, the telegraph reports. May, who the ap describes as having \" been under pressure to condemn trump directly \" while on a surprise trip to the middle east, on thursday called trump's retweets \" the wrong thing to do. \" after trump tweeted the videos from ultranationalist group britain first, some british lawmakers called for his state visit to be called off; politico reports london mayor sadiq khan called it \" increasingly clear that any official visit at all from president trump to britain would not be welcomed. \" but a may spokesman told reporters plans had not changed, saying the us \" is one of our oldest and closest allies. \" the ap looks at the stickiness that would be involved in rescinding the invitation — the queen would have to do so — but notes one potential route: delaying the visit due to the queen's busy spring, with a new great-grandchild expected and prince harry's wedding scheduled. Trump's tweet was also condemned by both democrats and republicans, with gop sen. Orrin hatch describing may as \" one of the great world leaders. \"",

        "summary": "A victory for samsung in its long-running feud with apple: a judge has refused to ban 26 of the south korean firm's smartphones, as apple wanted. A jury this summer found that samsung had knowingly infringed on apple's patents, but that's not sufficient grounds for a ban, judge lucy koh says. Instead, apple would have to prove \" irreparable harm \" by demonstrating that customers were choosing specific samsung devices over the cupertino company's own, forbes reports. Koh also noted that just \" a small fraction \" of apple's features suffered infringement, and \" it does not follow that entire products must be forever banned from the market, \" reuters reports. Apple is likely to appeal the move, forbes notes. In better news for the us firm, koh nixed samsung's call for a new trial over jury bias — leaving the $ 1.05 billion ruling in place, mashable notes. Meanwhile, samsung is ditching its bids for injunctions against apple in europe, where the european commission in january planned an antitrust probe over samsung patents. \" we strongly believe it is better when companies compete fairly in the marketplace, rather than in court, \" the company said in a statement to the verge.",

A follow-up picture shows the inked finger. As for the show itself, though it may have initially appeared perry did not diss taylor swift as expected, the gossip media is busily attempting to disprove that: while performing \" california gurls, \" perry's backup dancers wore high-waisted polka-dot bikinis, which hollywood life ( and some twitter users ) think was a subtle reference to the very similar bikini swift wore while on cape cod with conor kennedy in the summer of 2012. \" perry also flipped a few tutting hand signs, similar to the ones swift playfully makes in her video for'shake it off, ' \" cleveland.com reports. And, during that same \" california gurls \" medley, one of perry's dancing sharks was scott myrick, one of the reasons perry and swift are feuding in the first place. Myrick was a dancer on perry's 2011 tour, later scored a spot on a swift tour, then quit that gig to go back to perry, us reports. That incident is apparently what prompted swift's song \" bad blood. \" but \" a source close to the situation \" tells gossip cop the whole idea that perry dissed swift is complete nonsense.

The radical preacher, a high-ranking member of al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula, has been a most-wanted terror suspect for years. He is the biggest target to go down since osama bin laden. Tribal elders in the area say an airstrike, apparently from a us drone, hit an al-qaeda convoy, the ap reports. Previous reports of awlaki's death have turned out to be mistaken, but the new york times quotes senior administration officials as confirming. Awlaki's online lectures have been connected to several terror attacks in the us and across the world, including the fort hood shooting, the would-be underwear bomber, and the would-be times square bomber of last year. He also had the distinction of being the first american placed on the cia's \" kill or capture \" list.

Rhode island's lincoln chafee plans to switch to the party before he launches his bid for re-election in 2014, reports politico. Chafee used to be a republican senator, but he won the governor's seat in 2010 as an independent. The governor's office hasn't confirmed the news yet, but the washington post also has it, and considers the switch good news for democrats. For one thing, it means an independent chafee won't be splitting the vote with a democrat and potentially opening the way to a gop win in a mostly democratic state, writes sean sullivan. It doesn't mean, however, that victory will be a slam dunk for chafee, who has lackluster approval ratings. In fact, he might end up being an underdog in his new party's primary, which the providence journal says will include providence mayor angel taveras and state treasurer gina raimondo.",

Isotopic tests performed on a recently discovered skeleton — dubbed \" the boy with the amber necklace \" because of the beads tied round his neck — found that he traveled from the north coast of the mediterranean to get there. And scientists say his hundreds-of-miles journey gives credence to the belief that stonehenge was a top tourist attraction in prehistoric times. Other skeletons have been traced to brittany and the alps, the latter of which was found buried with gold and copper items — a sign that foreign visitors were wealthy. The bejeweled skeleton belonged to a teen who died near age 14 or 15, potentially bolstering the belief that sick travelers came to stonehenge in hopes of being healed, and were buried there if that didn't work out, reports the ap.

That project, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery made by tesla called powerwall, is designed to be installed in homes and store solar energy to be used at night or during power outages, cnnmoney reports. And that guy who announced it last night in a live-streamed unveiling in california is elon musk, the ambitious tesla ceo who hopes this energy alternative will reduce our need for fossil fuels, the detroit free press reports. \" the issue with existing batteries is that they suck, \" he said, per the newspaper. \" they're really horrible. \" not the powerwall, according to musk, which is scheduled to start shipping sometime this summer, the ap reports. The 220-pound wall-mounted battery charges \" using electricity generated from solar panels, or when utility rates are low, \" the powerwall site explains. But there's a cost to get there: the batteries go for $ 3,000 or $ 3,500, depending on its juice capacity, plus installation. \" the value proposition now is around reliability and backup power more than it is around savings, but over time that may change, \" says an analyst with gtm research. Indeed, musk's brother kimbal, one of tesla's board members, told cnnmoney earlier in the week that the battery would cut electricity bills by 25 %. As the ap explains, as more utilities permit power prices to fluctuate throughout the day based on market conditions, powerwall software will let customers use their own home-generated power — and not costly grid power — when grid prices are highest.",

Those numbers differ greatly from those reflected in screenshots from uber's zendesk customer support platform that were obtained by buzzfeed. Those images, which buzzfeed says were provided by a former uber customer service rep and confirmed by other parties, show 6,160 results for a search for \" sexual assault \" and 5,827 results for \" rape. \" in a response to the buzzfeed piece, uber calls those search results \" highly misleading, \" saying, for instance, riders may misspell \" rate \" or use the term \" rape \" out of context. Also, any word with the letters r-a-p-e in consecutive order will return a result for the search term \" rape \" ( e.g., the name \" don draper \" ). To that, buzzfeed says the screenshots it obtained show nine complaint tickets with the subject \" rape \" that do not appear to be misspellings, names, or email addresses. As for \" sexual assault, \" uber tells buzzfeed the high-volume query results on the obtained screenshots could be the result of riders making claims of assault on other transport services and discussions about sexual assaults in the news, among other things. In response to allegations of sexual assault, uber tells buzzfeed that its customer service reps are told to follow up with the person making the claim, and then report it to law enforcement if appropriate. The driver is temporarily deactivated during the investigation. If the investigation is inconclusive, the driver gets a warning and goes back to work. After two inconclusive investigations, a driver is permanently deactivated. While the data provided by uber doesn't jibe with the screenshots, buzzfeed notes, \" the sheer quantity of these tickets makes it difficult to tell which ones are exaggerations or attempts at false escalations and which are legitimate and urgent requests. \"",

In 1964, moseley raped and murdered 28-year-old bar manager kitty genovese while neighbors ignored her cries, the new york times reports. He had spotted his victim while driving around late at night and followed her to her building in queens. Accounts that 38 people witnessed the murder and not a single person called police turned out to be exaggerated, but the killing prompted national soul-searching and many studies on the \" bystander effect. \" it also led to good samaritan laws and hastened the adoption of the unified 911 system for reporting emergencies, the ap reports. In the genovese murder, moseley stalked his victim before stabbing her at least a dozen times. He left the scene after hearing a neighbor's shout but returned to resume the attack. After his arrest, he confessed to two more murders and eight rapes. He was sentenced to the electric chair in 1964, but the sentence was cut to life imprisonment in 1967. The following year, moseley raped a woman and took five hostages during a prison breakout. In later years, he earned a college degree and said he wanted to make amends for his crimes, but he was still denied parole 18 times, most recently in 2015. People reports that sunday's episode of girls was based on the genovese murder, which creator lena dunham calls the \" weirdest coincidence. \"",

During a joint news conference friday, trump thanked merkel for working to move germany toward paying 2 % of its gdp to nato ( germany currently pays 1.2 %; only five of 28 member countries meet the 2 % target ). But on saturday, he was more forceful on twitter: \" despite what you have heard from the fake news, i had a great meeting with german chancellor angela merkel, \" he tweeted. \" nevertheless, germany owes vast sums of money to nato &amp; the united states must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to germany! \" which immediately prompted many to point out that the white house shouldn't hold its breath waiting for a check that decidedly won't be in the mail. Former permanent rep to nato ivo daalder responded, \" sorry, mr president, that's not how nato works. The us decides for itself how much it contributes to defending nato. This is not a financial transaction, where nato countries pay the us to defend them. It is part of our treaty commitment. \" explains the guardian in quoting daalder, \" ultimately, members ' contributions are based on each nation's capability. Therefore, nato member nations do not ' owe ' or have to compensate any other country. \"",

        "summary": "The us border patrol has ballooned into a massive agency where employee misconduct is reportedly rampant, but figuring out who to blame — or how to fix it — is no easy job, politico reports via vox. Driven by security fears after 9/11, federal officials threw billions of dollars at border patrol and expanded its workforce from about 9,200 to 46,000 agents, some of whom, officials admit, were hired a little too quickly. \" from an integrity issue, you can't grow a law enforcement agency that quickly, \" says robert bonner, the first head of the newly minted customs and border protection in 2003. Before president obama took office, cbp had agents ( some reportedly cartel members ) accused of smuggling drugs or letting in illegals, while 2,170 employees were arrested on various charges between 2005 and 2012 — nearly one per day. Under obama, a bureaucratic turf war developed as the department of homeland security ( which oversees cbp ) apparently rebuffed fbi attempts to prosecute border agents. Homeland security didn't empower cbp with its own fully functioning internal affairs office, so allegations ranging from duis to officer shootings went ignored. \" not a single border patrol agent for the last eight years has been disciplined for excessive use of force, \" says a retired cbp official. \" with a workforce that large, that's amazing. \" so gil kerlikowske, cbp's first senate-confirmed leader in five years, has a lot on his plate — including an extra $ 225 million to hire 2,000 more officers. \" they're pretty good at expanding rapidly and finding applicants to take these jobs, \" an analyst tells fox news, but \" a cost of rapidly expanding could be a lower-quality border patrol. \"",

If the allegation about paterno is true, it would mean he knew about sandusky's crimes 22 years earlier than stated in special investigator reports, which alleged that paterno knew in 1998. Before his death, paterno said he became aware of allegations in 2001. \" an allegation now about an alleged event 40 years ago, as represented by a single line in a court document regarding an insurance issue, with no corroborating evidence, does not change the facts. Joe paterno did not, at any time, cover up conduct by jerry sandusky, \" the paterno family's lawyer says.

Now he's suing the oregon state board of examiners for squashing his first amendment right to discuss public safety issues, reports nbc news. The story began in 2013 when järlström's wife received a $ 260 ticket for running a red light, oregon live reported in 2014. He studied the light cycles at various intersections caught by traffic cameras and claimed that the formulas were outdated; he believes the yellow light cycle is too short for turning lanes. He attended more than a dozen city council meetings, did interviews with local television stations, and even wrote to the state's board of engineer examiners. That's where his trouble started, reports motherboard, because he included the words, \"i am an engineer \" in his email. State law says that engineers must be licensed by the state to practice engineering, which includes speaking on the topic. The automated traffic cameras in beaverton resulted in 25,000 tickets between 2001 and 2014, many of which the 56-year-old järlström believes are unwarranted. But for järlström, who paid the board's $ 500 fine ( his wife's original $ 260 fine was also paid ), the matter is now more personal. \" it's important in my mind we can share ideas freely in oregon to promote innovation, \" he says, per oregon live. \" i feel violated at this point in time. \" and his work is far from done: he's also working on an article on the subject he hopes to publish in an academic journal.",

Instead, experts believe mh370 lies to the north, within a 10,000-square-mile patch of the indian ocean that's about 20 % of the size of the current search area, based on new flight simulations, an analysis of satellite communications, and debris drift patterns. The report adds there's only a 5 % chance the plane was missed over the 42,500 square miles searched so far, reports cnn. Experts and investigators are \" in agreement in the need to search an additional area \" and \" concluded that, if this area were to be searched, prospective areas for locating the aircraft wreckage, based on all the analysis to date, would be exhausted, \" the report states, per the guardian.

One of his biggest applause lines was aimed directly at president obama. \"israel will not return to the indefensible boundaries of 1967, \" netanyahu said, prompting a big standing ovation. Later he added: \"israel on the 1967 lines would be only 9 miles wide. So much for defensible borders. \" as netanyahu himself pointed out, the president has not called on israel to return to the exact 1967 borders. The president has said that a peace agreement should be \"based on 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps. \" nevertheless, netanyahu speech – and the thunderous bi-partisan response – was a clear challenge to the idea of using the 1967 boundaries – with or without \"swaps \" -- as a basis for a peace deal. Netanyahu also got big ovations with hard-line statements on two other perennial sticking points to israeli-palestinian peace agreements: no right of return for palestinian refugees, insisted, and \"jerusalem will never again be divided.

But the president's comments touched a nerve among pro-israel activists, drew a rare oval office rebuke from is­raeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu and instantly became a litmus test in domestic american politics. Now obama — whom critics often accuse of employing a play-it-safe governing style in which he waits for others to take the lead — is largely isolated politically in raising the issue of boundaries.

            "Abc's jonathan karl ( @jonkarl ) reports: prime minister benjamin netanyahu's speech before a joint meeting of congress had all trappings of a state of the union address by a president with sky-high approval ratings. Speaking to a packed house chamber with speaker boehner and vice president biden over his shoulders, netanyahu was repeatedly interrupted by applause – including more than 20 standing ovations. One of his biggest applause lines was aimed directly at president obama. \"israel will not return to the indefensible boundaries of 1967, \" netanyahu said, prompting a big standing ovation. Later he added: \"israel on the 1967 lines would be only 9 miles wide. So much for defensible borders. \" as netanyahu himself pointed out, the president has not called on israel to return to the exact 1967 borders. The president has said that a peace agreement should be \"based on 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps. \" nevertheless, netanyahu speech – and the thunderous bi-partisan response – was a clear challenge to the idea of using the 1967 boundaries – with or without \"swaps \" -- as a basis for a peace deal. Netanyahu also got big ovations with hard-line statements on two other perennial sticking points to israeli-palestinian peace agreements: no right of return for palestinian refugees, insisted, and \"jerusalem will never again be divided. Israel must remain the united capital"

On his show monday, stern lashed out at the idea that the media \" discovered \" the tapes, since the shows were aired to the general public, billboard reports. He also explained that he considers trump a friend and that he won't be re-airing the interviews because that would be a \" betrayal, \" the los angeles times reports. \" donald trump did the show in an effort to be entertaining and have fun with us, \" he said. \" i fully knew what i was doing when i interviewed trump.

        "summary": "The term \" drunkorexia \" has been used for several years to describe a particularly risky type of behavior on college campuses — students skip meals or exercise intensely before drinking, or deliberately purge during or afterward. Generally, the idea is to cut down on calories consumed or to increase the buzz, and sometimes a little of both. A new study, however, suggests that the practice is far more common that thought, reports inside higher ed. The university of houston survey rounded up nearly 1,200 students who had at least one bout of heavy drinking in the previous month and found that eight in 10 had engaged in at least one behavior linked to drunkorexia, including inducing vomiting, consuming laxatives, or skipping food entirely before drinking. The other surprise to lead researcher dr. Dipali rinker: this wasn't a phenomenon exclusive to female students. \" our study suggested that males are just as likely, if not more likely, to engage in these behaviors, \" she tells medscape. \" we suspect that this is because men, in general, just tend to engage in riskier drinking behaviors than women. \" rinker presented her findings at the research society on alcoholism's annual meeting in new orleans, and another researcher's paper shows that the issue isn't confined to america. An australian study of female college students found that nearly 60 % used drunkorexia behavior. \"it's a new phenomenon ­involving disordered eating purely for the sole purpose of saving calories for alcohol, \" says researcher alissa knight of the university of south australia.

According to an io9 report from a few years ago, the area's residents experience so much lightning that they need to shut their blinds 300 nights per year; each night brings some 40,000 strikes. The other place is in the democratic republic of congo's far east, between the country's maiko national park and itombwe nature reserve. That not-so-big area gets more than 10 million lightning strikes each year, the weather network reports, compared to the 2 million that all of canada gets. As for why the equator experiences so much lightning — and why it happens more on land than on water — popular science explains that it's a result of heat. The equator is, of course, hot thanks to the amount of sun it gets; meanwhile, land gets hot faster than water does. The map comes from the data two satellites collected between 1998 and 2013. ( lightning could increase in the coming years. )",

And on 9/11, the \" man in the red bandana \" was a hero: \" he called for fire extinguishers to fight back the flames. He attended to the wounded. He led those survivors down the stairs to safety, and carried a woman on his shoulders down 17 flights. Then, he went back, back up all those flights, then back down again, bringing more wounded to safety, until that moment when the tower fell....

And from this day forward, all those who come here will have a chance to know the sacrifice of a young man who, like so many, gave his life so others might live. \" in advance of his comments, obama, the first lady, and former nyc mayor michael bloomberg toured the museum, whose seven stories hold artifacts from the attack, including what cnn calls the \" ordinary \": leather gloves ( used during the recovery effort ), a red wallet ( owned by a cantor fitzgerald employee ), a $ 2 bill ( from the wallet of a victim who gave his wife one, too, as a reminder of their second chance at love ).

Nbc news reports the team announced the boycott thursday after 10 players were suspended for an alleged sexual assault. Players were upset they weren't notified of the suspensions ahead of time and felt the office of equal opportunity and affirmative action investigation that led to them lacked \" due process, \" according to npr. The team met with school administrators friday. They said they decided to end the boycott after \" it became clear \" the suspended students would not be reinstated. In return, they say the university agreed to give the suspended players a \" fair hearing \" with a \" diverse review panel. \" the 10 players are facing a range of punishments from expulsion to a one-year suspension for the alleged gang rape of a female student in september, the minneapolis star tribune reports. The woman had been drinking when she went to a football player's apartment. According to police reports and her testimony, at least a dozen men got in line to have sex with her against her will. She says she \" felt scared, trapped, isolated. \" she says the men ignored her cries for help, laughed at her, and cheered each other on. The accused players say the sex was consensual, and no criminal charges were filed. In a statement following the end of their boycott, the football team said, \" there is no misperception: sexual harassment and violence against women have no place on this campus, on our team. \"",

Bowler. Until that point, tsarnaev had been responding to the interagency high value detainee interrogation group, including admitting his role in the bombing, authorities said. A senior congressional aide said tsarnaev had asked several times for a lawyer, but that request was ignored since he was being questioned under the public safety exemption to the miranda rule. \" if that detail is true — and greenwald acknowledges that it's a bit thinly sourced — then we should all be concerned. This is a much bigger deal than delaying the reading of tsarnaev's miranda rights. \" this is a us citizen arrested for an alleged crime on us soil: there is no justification whatsoever for denying him his repeatedly exercised right to counsel, \" writes greenwald in the guardian. Worse, no one in washington cares, because they're more concerned that tsarnaev's rights weren't violated even further — they're piling on the judge who finally mirandized him. You may not like tsarnaev, writes greenwald, but you should still be concerned over the way he's treated. As thomas paine put it in 1795, \" he that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself. \" click for greenwald's full column.",

The official said circumstances are still under investigation, but it appears to be an insider attack.

Nearly a decade later, after finding no trace of the missing man, an ontario court declared him dead in 1986. Fast forward to last july, authorities say a routine audit of his mysterious disappearance linked stan to a 69-year-old man living more than 1,000 miles"

The city council voted unanimously earlier wednesday to sell the parks, a move that allowed the legal removal of the statues. The city had been barred from taking down the confederate statues under the tennessee heritage protection act, which bans the removal or renaming of memorials on public land, the new york times reports. In october, a state agency rejected the city's request to waive the heritage law and allow the removal of the two statues. The greenspace nonprofit was incorporated the same month. Memphis chief legal officer bruce mcmullen says the two statues will be stored in an undisclosed location, the ap reports. The times reports that onlookers cheered as a crane lifted the statue of forrest — a former slave trader, alleged war criminal, and early ku klux klan member — from its pedestal, with some chanting \" hey hey! ho ho! that racist statue has got to go. \" \" history is being made tonight, \" said memphis mayor jim strickland in a long series of tweets explaining the move, which comes ahead of the 50th anniversary of the memphis assassination of martin luther king jr.",

        "summary": "One hundred million years ago, a sauropod that stretched more than 120 feet and weighed some 70 tons existed — perhaps the largest creature to ever roam the earth. Over the past few years, researchers have excavated fossils from six young-adult dinosaurs from a patagonian quarry, and new scientist puts stats for patagotitan mayorum in perspective: the creature would have been the length of about seven elephants. The ap estimates it would have been as heavy as a space shuttle, with team member diego pol noting that placing patagotitan next to a t. Rex would be like putting \" an elephant by a lion. \" per the atlantic, that means the plant-eating patagotitan was double the size of the already-huge brachiosaurus and apatosaurus, and about 10 % larger than the reigning dinosaur giant, a titanosaur known as argentinosaurus. As the study in the proceedings of the royal society b journal details, this find sheds more light on how sauropods in the 12- to 20-ton range saw their mass triple, evolving into lognkosaurs, of which patagotitan is a member. Charlotte brassey, a manchester metropolitan university researcher not tied to the study, speculates that this animal from the cretaceous period ballooned in size perhaps due to increasingly diverse and abundant plants that were like an \" all-you-can-eat buffet for these dinosaurs, \" the ap notes. Brassey notes that the patagotitan's skeleton, metabolism, or behavior ( or all of these things ) could have changed and spurred the growth spurt. \" maybe someone can find a bigger [ dinosaur ], but i feel like maybe this is the limit, \" study co-author jose carballido says.

The fossils, which include vertebrae and rib bones, are from six young adult dinosaurs, and were all found in the same patagonian quarry in argentina. The species, named patagotitan mayorum, is thought to have weighed around 62 tonnes and measured more than 35 metres from nose to tail. If you're struggling to picture that, it's about seven elephants, or more than two buses, or half the width of a football pitch, or somewhere between a standard swimming pool and an olympic pool.

And that's precisely what its board members are meeting about sunday, reports the new york times, when they're set to discuss a possible leave of absence of ceo and cofounder travis kalanick. During the meeting, the board will also review an exhaustive investigation into the company's troubles led by former attorney general eric holder and his covington &amp; burling colleague tammy albarran. The report, known as the \" holder investigation \" by insiders, seeks to shed light on the seemingly nonstop scandalous headlines that have painted uber's work culture as toxic. Among other things, the job of senior vp emil michael is reportedly in danger. Before sunday's meeting, few had seen the report, which was launched in february after a former engineer detailed alleged sexual harassment that resulted in workplace repercussions in a viral blog post. One source told recode that its findings were \"ugly \" and \"a story of a workplace gone wrong in a lot of key ways. \" though the months-long investigation involves hundreds of interviews, the times points out that kalanick and members close to him have more voting power than the rest of the board given their \"founder-friendly \" governing structure, essentially giving them the power to ignore its recommendations. But empty gestures from the top can backfire, warns attorney stephen hirschfeld: \"it can have an even worse impact on company morale if people already know it's a total joke. \"",

That's right: cruz has officially endorsed donald trump for president. In a facebook post friday, cruz says he's decided to vote for trump \" after many months of careful consideration, of prayer, and searching my own conscience. \" he cites his own stance as \" #neverhillary \" and trump's positions on energy, immigration, national security, and more as reasons to vote for a man he once said some very negative things about. According to cnn, cruz previously said he wouldn't endorse trump after trump implied cruz's father may have been involved in the jfk assassination and insulted cruz's wife's looks. While cnn calls it a \" stunning \" move, the bbc notes there are a few reasons cruz may have changed his tune. One, trump now appears to have a better shot at winning — or at least not embarrassing himself — lessening the chances cruz can say \" i told you so. \" it also now appears that \" trump-ism is the future of the republican party, \" and cruz has to worry about facing a pro-trump primary opponent in 2018. In a statement, trump says he's \" greatly honored by the endorsement. \" trump had previously said he wouldn't accept an endorsement from \" lyin'ted \" cruz.",

University of texas researchers took a fresh look at climate models and at how co2 is absorbed by plants, analyzing the way it spreads inside leaves, reports the bbc. \" there is a time lag between scientists who study fundamental processes and modellers who model those processes in a large-scale model, \" says one of the authors of the study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences.

An energy systems analyst at melbourne university agrees that cuts are still vital. A larger carbon turnover in plants doesn't necessarily mean greater carbon storage, he tells the australian, \" in the same way that larger cash turnover in a business does not necessarily result in larger profits. \" ( another recent study predicted that if co2 levels continue to increase, we ' ll have \" big plants but nothing to eat \" by 2070. )",

Chairman rick palacio says a \" reporting error \" by a volunteer resulted in sanders getting 570 votes — nearly 4 % — fewer than he should have. The colorado democratic party realized the error a week after the caucus and corrected it but didn't publicly acknowledge it until the post discovered it monday. \" it was an embarrassment on our part for sure, \" palacio says. And while the party discussed the new results with the clinton campaign last week, it didn't inform the sanders campaign because, as palacio puts it, \" it didn't necessarily affect \" them. The sanders campaign found out about the situation from the post on monday. The shift of one delegate can have big ramifications for both campaigns in colorado. The new tally gives sanders 39 delegates to clinton's 27 with 12 superdelegates in play. Clinton was expected to get the support of the superdelegates and end up taking a majority of colorado's total delegates. Now the best she can do is tie sanders. And if sanders picks up even one of the two superdelegates who remain undecided, he takes the majority. This is undeniably good news for sanders, but don't get too excited yet. The washington post reports clinton still has a huge delegate lead over sanders — even without taking superdelegates into consideration — and \" will almost certainly be her party's nominee. \"",

In a study published in the preprint server biorxiv, william hedley thompson and his karolinska institute team checked out more than 700,000 english-language abstracts from nearly 125 biomedical journals from 1881 to 2015 and discovered technical jargon has been on the upswing — but it's not just profession-tied vernacular sneaking into the text. The researchers also found an uptick in \" general scientific jargon, \" or longer words that aren't necessarily of scientific origin ( e.g., \" furthermore \" ) that keep turning up in science papers and muddling comprehension. Per science alert, the researchers held the abstracts up to two readability yardsticks that looked at how many syllables words had, sentence length, and reader familiarity with the language. What they found, from 1881 onward, is that readability has declined steadily over the years, results they call \" concerning \" considering it means scientific findings are less accessible. But philip ball, writing for nature, points out issues with the study, noting that the readability gauges used common words measured against us fourth-graders ' comprehension, not that of adults; that some of the earlier data ( pre-1960 ) may not have been terribly reliable; and that technical jargon isn't inherently bad if it eventually places more scientific words in our everyday vocabulary. What ball thinks could help: researchers being exposed to more good writing that would inform their own documentation and make it clearer for readers. \" why not encourage students to put down nature and pick up darwin, dawkins, or dickens? \" he asks.

The newspaper says the talks revolve around chris christie, jeb bush, and, yes, mitt romney. For example, the story says that previous romney backer woody johnson, a billionaire who owns the new york jets, has met with both bush and christie but won't commit to either until romney decides whether he's in or out, which might not be until summer. Rand paul and rick perry are mentioned later in the story. \" talk of an establishment coronation is likely to incur the wrath of party activists and outside groups seeking a more conservative nominee, \" writes nicholas confessore. A separate post article today report that an \" invisible primary \" is well underway as candidates vie to lock down the support of wealthy donors, but it adds that these donors are unusually wary about committing early. The result \" could stall the gop race for months. \" for the record, the post's predicted winner at this point is paul, followed by christie, bush, marco rubio, and scott walker.",

Michelle o ' flynn, director of queensland advocacy inc., notes the couple's parents could try to block a pregnancy by getting a sterilization order, though she says they'd probably fail and that that option is \" abhorrent. \" disability advocates like o ' flynn say it's cox and anderton's right to retain \" bodily integrity \" and reproduce if they want.

            "Human sexuality encompasses an individual's self-esteem, interpersonal relationships and social experiences relating to dating, marriage and the physical aspects of sex. Sex education, appropriate for the developmental level and intellectual attainment of individuals with down syndrome, adds to life quality by engendering healthy sexuality, reducing the risk of sexual abuse, avoiding sexual misunderstandings, preventing disease transmission, preventing unwanted pregnancy and alleviating other problems related to sexual function. Do individuals with down syndrome have sexual feelings? in the past, sexuality was not considered an issue for any people with down syndrome because of the inaccurate belief that intellectual disability ( formerly known as mental retardation ) produced permanent childhood. In fact, all people with down syndrome have sexual feelings and intimacy needs. It is important that expression of these feelings in socially acceptable, age appropriate ways be recognized by families and caregivers. Sexuality education is the way to plan for this aspect of adulthood as it applies to independence in educational, social, residential and vocational settings. Do children with down syndrome develop physically the same way as their peers in the general population? children with down syndrome experience the same sequence of physical and hormonal changes associated with puberty as other children their age. However, there is often a lag in the development of social maturity, emotional self control, social communication, abstract thinking",
