        "summary": "A mysterious plane crash in nearly inaccessible terrain. A foreign government fails to investigate thoroughly. Missing black boxes. No bodies or blood. An airline that was later implicated in large-scale cocaine smuggling, then went bankrupt. And... A bunch of crocodile skins? these are the mysteries that drew americans dan futrell and isaac stoner to the decades-old case of eastern airlines flight 980, which crashed into the side of a bolivian mountain on new year's day in 1985. With journalist peter frick-wright in tow, the pair hopped a plane to south america to see if they could locate the black box flight recorders, which were never found. Surprisingly, they did find both — in pieces. The full tale, published at outside, turns out to be more fascinating than they could have ever predicted. Eastern airlines flight 980 went down on its stormy approach to la paz, bolivia, killing all aboard. The flight, operated by now-defunct eastern airlines, originated in paraguay. Due to a number of factors, the crash site was never satisfactorily investigated by bolivian or us authorities. The families of the 29 passengers were left in limbo, and conspiracy theorists quickly began whispering about dark dealings involving the bolivian government, ronald reagan's white house, and the paraguayan mafia. And as it turns out, futrell, stoner, and frick-wright didn't really have all that much trouble accessing the site, where debris from the crash is slowly sliding down the mountain. They even brought back the black box fragments, as well as the tape, which now sit in futrell and stoner's kitchen in legal limbo. So why all the secrecy? as the bolivian government and the us government aren't on great terms at the moment, it may be a while before we can find out. Until then, frick-wright's story is excellent.",

Reports from the scene said that none of the 29 people on board had survived and that the wreckage was scattered over a large area, embedded in thick snow, with only the tail visible. Among the american passengers reported aboard the boeing 727 plane was marian davis, wife of arthur h. Davis, the ambassador to paraguay, according to alan romberg, a state department spokesman. Airport officials at el alto airport, where the plane had been headed, identified another of the american passengers as william kelley, director of the peace corps in paraguay. A third american passenger was identified by eastern as jonathan watson. No further information on mr. Watson was immediately available.

It was located in ephesus ( near the modern town of selçuk in present-day turkey ). It was completely rebuilt three times, and in its final form was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. By 401 ad it had been ruined or destroyed. [ 1 ] only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site. The earliest version of the temple ( a temenos ) antedated the ionic immigration by many years, and dates to the bronze age. Callimachus, in his hymn to artemis, attributed it to the amazons. In the 7th century bc, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form, began around 550 bc, under the cretan architect chersiphron and his son metagenes. The project was funded by croesus of lydia, and took 10 years to complete. This version of the temple was destroyed",

But the world's \" largest producer of nickel and palladium \" initially had only denials, going so far as to say that \" the color of the [ daldykan river ] today doesn't differ from its usual condition. \" now, a changed tune: in a monday press release the company stated that an internal investigation found that \" abnormal heavy rain \" on sept. 5 caused what the bbc refers to as a \" filtration dam \" to overflow, sending \" residual wash water \" into the river. The ap reports the dike that was crested was located outside a waste storage facility at its nadezhdinskaya plant. \" short-term river color staining with iron salts presents no hazards for people and river fauna, \" the press release continues. A russian greenpeace official isn't assuaged by that line, telling the afp that while \" there is a ministry of environment commission there \" now, following up on alleged pollution wrought by norilsk nickel is challenging because of the remote location and the company's control of the taymyr peninsula where the incident occurred. The ap notes the area has struggled with environmental issues dating back to the construction of the first plant there roughly eight decades ago. Indeed, the new york times last week called the company \" by many measures one of the world's most polluting enterprises, \" noting the sulfur dioxide generated by the plant has formed a dead zone equal to two rhode islands around it.

        "summary": "Us relations with china took a potentially nasty turn on monday when president trump ordered a preliminary inquiry into beijing's trade practices. Even before trump formally signed a memorandum to put things in motion, china made it clear it was unhappy. The move will hurt the us economy and \" poison \" us-china relations, declared an editorial in the official china daily newspaper, per reuters. And a foreign ministry spokeswoman warned of a potential trade war with \" no winner, \" per the ap. The basics: trump directed his top trade official, us trade representative robert lighthizer, to look into whether china is treating us businesses unfairly and infringing on their intellectual property, per cnbc. Lighthizer's task is to figure out whether a larger, formal investigation is warranted. There's no timetable, but it could take him up to a year. Which means: this isn't so much an investigation as it is an investigation into an investigation, and this interim move could give the two sides time to work something out before things get too far along, explains the new york times. Trump: \" it's a very big move, \" the president said in signing the memorandum. He called it an important step to \" protect the intellectual property of american companies \" and thus american jobs. See the video. One main complaint: china often forces us companies who want to work in the nation to partner with chinese companies and thus share proprietary tech secrets, per the times. A member of a bipartisan group called the us-china economic and security review commission says the white house action is \" long overdue \" because \"china's been engaged in the theft and forced transfer of us technologies and intellectual property for years. \" too soft? china may be ticked, but trump critics such as sen. Charles schumer think the white house is going easy on beijing. \" to make an announcement that they're going to decide whether to have an investigation on china's well-documented theft of our intellectual property is another signal to china that it is ok to keep stealing. \" north korea: of course, all this is playing out amid the backdrop of north korea, with the white house hoping to get china to help rein in the north. There are two schools of thought on that: this inquiry could be leverage to pressure china, notes the washington post, or it could backfire and make beijing more reluctant than ever to help the us. The story notes that the announcement seems to have been delayed to come after the us got china to go along with un sanctions on pyongyang.",

That's a lot of tension that needs to be released, which would be devastating: a 2008 usgs study found a 7.8-magnitude quake on the san andreas fault's southern portion could cause 1,800 fatalities, 50,000 injuries, and $ 200 billion in damage. Other parts of the fault have also remained dormant even longer, including in san bernardino county ( no major shakeup since 1812 ) and near the salton sea, more or less steady since the late 1600s. \" we are fortunate that seismic activity in california has been relatively low over the past century, \" jordan said last year. \" but we know that tectonic forces are continually tightening the springs … making big quakes inevitable. \" ( meet the san andreas ' \" equally dangerous \" partner. )",

        "summary": "The 59-year-old neighbor accused of tackling sen. Rand paul while he was mowing his lawn last friday in kentucky pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor assault on thursday, the washington post reports. Rene boucher, a retired anesthesiologist and democrat who has lived next to paul in a gated community for years, faces up to a year in jail on the misdemeanor charge but could face a much harsher penalty if an ongoing investigation results in felony charges. Meanwhile, the reason for the alleged attack by a neighbor is a mystery that's only getting deeper. On thursday, boucher's lawyer said the incident \" was unequivocally not about politics \" — a motivation that would make more serious federal charges more likely — and that musings of a property dispute are more \" on target. \" more: while not coming out and saying it, paul seems to dispute the landscaping disagreement explanation, politico reports. On wednesday, the senator tweeted links to breitbart news and washington examiner stories that quoted neighbors skeptical of that motive and hinted at political reasons for the alleged attack. Paul also updated his medical condition on wednesday, stating that he has six broken ribs — not five — and a buildup of fluid near his lungs, according to the hill.",

        "summary": "A psychologist by the name of walter mischel died this month at age 88, and if the name doesn't ring a bell, a test he concocted in the 1960s just might. It's the \" marshmallow test, \" and the premise is simple: mischel presented young children with a marshmallow ( or other treat ) and offered a deal. If they could sit alone in a room with the marshmallow for a while without eating it, they'd get two when he returned, explains quartz. As it turns out, only about 1 in 3 of the kids managed to refrain from eating it, notes the washington post. The test gained renown when mischel followed up with the kids and found a striking correlation: those who learned to master the art of self-gratification tended to be more successful later in life. But as mischel himself would stress, the results often were misinterpreted in the mainstream. One key part of his test that often goes unmentioned, he once explained, is that some of the kids were taught strategies on how to keep from eating the marshmallow, while others were left to their own devices, reports npr. The main lesson, then, was that people can teach themselves better habits rather than relying on sheer willpower. \" people can use their wonderful brains to think differently about situations, to reframe them, to reconstrue them, to even reconstrue themselves, \" mischel said. ( see this video for the interview. ) another facet of mischel's life: he grew up as a jewish child in austria before world war ii, and he gave a 2014 interview to the guardian in which he talks about the hardships he endured.

Ktla reports that she was killed; the owner of the salon, randy fannin, reportedly also died. Friends say dekraai, who initiated the 2007 divorce, at one point appeared to have custody of the couple's 8-year-old son, and that his ex-wife had to meet conditions such as abstaining from alcohol in order to visit with him. Neighbors say dekraai's ex-wife took out a restraining order against him on tuesday, and that dekraai was not happy with her parenting skills or their current joint custody arrangement.

I am in for chairman again. \" story continued below dean served as democratic national committee chairman from 2005 to 2009. Donna brazile is currently serving as interim chairwoman after debbie wasserman schultz stepped down shortly before the democratic national convention in philadelphia. Known for his 50-state strategy, dean enters a possible crowded field of democrats jockeying to lead their party after hillary clinton's shocking loss in the presidential election tuesday night. Politico reported earlier thursday that vermont sen. Bernie sanders is backing rep. Keith ellison ( d-minn. ) in the contest. Ellison was a top surrogate for sanders during his primary campaign for president. The liberal outside group moveon.org also released a statement on thursday saying the dnc needed to \" clean house \" and that ellison would make an excellent chairman. Also rumored to be in the mix are former michigan gov. Jennifer granholm, south carolina democratic party chairman jaime harrison, and new hampshire democratic party chairman ray buckley. Retiring rep. Steve israel ( d-n.y. ) and rep. Xavier becerra ( d-calif. ) have also been mentioned as contenders but it's unclear whether they could win an election for chair given the strong distaste among party members to have another house member run the committee. The news of dean's decision came as a surprise to members of the democratic party, but operatives who worked with him in the past were enthusiastic. \" i think he'd be a great dnc chair. I worked for him after the ' 04 election, very similar situation and what he did was revitalize the party, \" said moses mercado, a former dnc deputy executive director. \" he talked about the 50-state strategy that we've kind of forgotten, which to his point, i haven't talked to him since he decided to do this, but this is what he talked about. We've got to go to these states. This is exactly what he spoke about 10 years ago. So it's no surprise to me that he would be great in this position. \" mercado, asked whether dean's decision would frighten away other potential candidates, said, \" i would think so. \" \"",

            "Howard dean served as dnc chairman from 2005 to 2009. &#124; ap photo howard dean: i ' m running for dnc chair former vermont gov. Howard dean said he is running for his old job atop the democratic party. \" the dems need organization and focus on the young, \" dean tweeted thursday. \" need a fifty state strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again. \" story continued below dean served as democratic national committee chairman from 2005 to 2009. Donna brazile is currently serving as interim chairwoman after debbie wasserman schultz stepped down shortly before the democratic national convention in philadelphia. Known for his 50-state strategy, dean enters a possible crowded field of democrats jockeying to lead their party after hillary clinton's shocking loss in the presidential election tuesday night. Politico reported earlier thursday that vermont sen. Bernie sanders is backing rep. Keith ellison ( d-minn. ) in the contest. Ellison was a top surrogate for sanders during his primary campaign for president. The liberal outside group moveon.org also released a statement on thursday saying the dnc needed to \" clean house \" and that ellison would make an excellent chairman. Also rumored to be in the mix are former michigan gov. Jennifer granholm, south carolina democratic party chairman jaime harrison, and new hampshire democratic party chairman ray buckley. Retiring rep. Steve israel ( d-n.y. ) and rep. Xavier becerra ( d-calif. ) have also been mentioned as contenders but it's unclear whether they could win an election for chair given the strong distaste among party members to have another house member run the committee. The news of dean's decision came as a surprise to members of the democratic party, but operatives who worked with him in the past were enthusiastic. \" i think he'd be a great dnc chair. I worked for him after the ' 04 election, very similar situation and what he did was revitalize the party, \" said moses mercado, a former dnc deputy executive director. \" he talked about the 50-state strategy that we've kind of forgotten, which to his point, i haven't talked to him since he decided to do this, but this is what he talked about. We've got to go to these states. This is exactly what he spoke about 10 years ago. So it's no surprise to me that he would be great in this position. \" mercado, asked whether dean's decision would frighten away other potential candidates, said, \" i would think so. \" \"",

So suggests a new study out this week in the journal of the national cancer institute involving 1,636 women with breast cancer; those who breastfed their babies were 30 % less likely to have the cancer recur and 28 % less likely to die from it than those who had never breastfed. The research builds on previous findings that breastfeeding reduces a woman's overall chance of getting breast cancer in the first place. \" if a woman breastfeeds, she reduces her risk of developing breast cancer by about 5 % to 10 %, although other factors come into play, \" such as how many children she's had, study leader marilyn kwan at kaiser permanente tells healthday news. \" we think this is one of the first [ studies ] to examine the role of breastfeeding and breast cancer outcomes — prognosis and survival. \" of note: while any duration of breastfeeding improved prognosis and survival to some degree, doing so for less than six months was less protective. Kwan adds to the chorus of researchers who postulate that breastfeeding helps ductal cells fully mature and thus better resist cancer. ( when it comes to getting breast cancer in the first place, the numbers are even more convincing. )",

In addition to calling wasserman schultz \"vile, unprofessional and despicable \" and \"a coward \" for criticizing him on the floor of the house, west's e-mail added, \"you have proven repeatedly that you are not a lady, therefore, shall not be afforded due respect from me! \" said frankel: \"congressman west owes an apology to every woman who's been told to 'shut up ' and sit quietly in the corner and to every senior citizen who, if west and his right wing allies get their way, will have to worry about whether they will be able to afford their health care. \" murphy called west \"truly unhinged and incapable of controlling himself … enough"

She's already off the insulin she had to take in connection with her type 2 diabetes and, most significantly, her body is indicating to her that it feels full after she eats — in comparison to her feeling constantly starved before. The absence of that fullness cue pushed her weight to more than 200 pounds on her 4-foot-7 frame, a condition that resulted from damage her hypothalamus sustained during surgery she underwent two years ago related to a benign brain tumor. \"there was no sign of her diabetes 24 hours after the surgery, \" said dr. Thomas inge, the doctor in charge of alexis ' care at cincinnati children's hospital medical center ( he explains how this is possible on the hospital's blog ). Alexis left the hospital on friday; after another week in cincinnati for observation, she ' ll head back to cibolo, texas. The sleeve gastrectomy surgery she underwent left no more than 25 % of her stomach intact, per the blog; alexis is currently on a soft diet of protein drinks, yogurts, and puddings, consumed roughly five teaspoons at a time. She has reported feeling full after three, reports nbc news. Doctors won't know how much weight she may have already lost for about another week, but inge predicts she could drop about 40 pounds in the next few months.",

Police video shows crutcher walking toward his suv with his hands up and a female officer following him. The vehicle is stopped in the middle of the road. As crutcher approaches the driver's side of the suv, three male officers walk up and crutcher appears to lower his hands and place them on the vehicle. The officers surround him, making it harder to see his actions from the police dashboard camera's angle. Crutcher can be seen dropping to the ground. Someone on the police radio says, \" i think he may have just been tasered. \" one of the officers near crutcher backs up slightly.

In particular, o'reilly claims to have witnessed combat during the 1982 falklands war while working for cbs news and in 2013 said he saved his cameraman. \" i was in a situation one time, in a war zone in argentina, in the falklands, where my photographer got run down and then hit his head and was bleeding from the ear on the concrete.

Instead, the us media was stationed 1,200 miles away in buenos aires. Cbs ' bob schieffer says it was \" impossible \" for us journalists to see combat. \" for us, you were a thousand miles from where the fighting was. So we had some great meals. \" in his 2001 book the no spin zone, o'reilly says he was \" on the ground in active war zones from el salvador to the falklands, \" but only describes a \" major riot \" in buenos aires, where he says \" many were killed \" after the war had ended. When recounting the riot in a 2009 interview, the cameraman story was told in the context of the protest. O'reilly said he dragged his cameraman off the streets \" because he was bleeding from the ear and had hit his head on the concrete. \" he added soldiers were \" gunning these people down \" and one pointed an m16 at him. News reports from the day make no mention of deaths. As mother jones puts it, \" the protest in buenos aires was not combat. Nor was it part of the falklands war. Yet o'reilly has referred to his work in argentina — and his rescue of his cameraman — as occurring in a ' war zone.

The bbc reports that on sunday, former conservative party leader michael howard warned that if it has to, britain will defend its gibraltar territory from spain the same way it defended the falklands islands 35 years ago. In 1982, \" another woman prime minister sent a task force halfway across the world to defend the freedom of another small group of british people against another spanish-speaking country \" and theresa may \" will show the same resolve in standing by the people, \" howard said. Howard's remarks followed the eu's release of brexit negotiating guidelines stating that spain would have to sign off on any decisions affecting gibraltar, a 2.6-square-mile territory on its south coast. \" someone in the uk is losing their cool and there's no need for it, \" said spain's foreign minister, alfonso dastis. \" the spanish government is a little surprised by the tone of comments coming out of britain, a country known for its composure, \" he added, per the guardian.

Meanwhile, about 50 demonstrators gathered outside the courthouse, chanting slogans such as \" all night all day! we will fight for freddie gray! \" per the washington post. Lawyers for the accused cops have said they didn't think their clients could get impartial juries in baltimore, but williams wanted to try anyway, per usa today. The post reports the jury pool \" appeared to be a diverse group of men and women of all ages, with a majority of them black. \" porter, 26, was in the police van in which gray was driven for 45 minutes after his april 12 arrest; prosecutors say porter ignored gray's requests for medical assistance, per usa today. Porter, who is black, is charged with manslaughter, reckless endangerment, assault, and misconduct in office, per the sun. Williams says the closely watched trial likely won't go past dec. 17, but it's what happens after the verdict that has many people nervous: abc news notes that a conviction will upend the already troubled baltimore police department, while an acquittal could cause more unrest in the city. \" if it doesn't go over well, what will christmas be like? \" a community activist tells abc. \" if we have more riots, who will feel safe? the world is watching baltimore. \"",

And now comes yet another report that facebook is trying to make a smartphone? at pc magazine, dan costa has some advice: don't do it. Facebook does indeed have weak mobile offerings, but the company should fix this problem with better software — its strong suit — not hardware. Building a smartphone is technically difficult, and then there's the hassle of dealing with carriers and the fcc to consider. While a minority of facebook loyalists might sign on, costa thinks most people would shy away from a phone that might limit their flexibility. \" will the facebook phone support twitter? can i use hipstamatic or do i have to use instagram? \" he writes. \" people will only carry one phone, and they will want it to be one that is social network agnostic. \" forget the hardware, facebook.

The jacket comes in four styles ( sweatshirt, windbreaker, bomber, and blazer ) and has 15 features, including an inflatable neck pillow, a pocket that doubles as a cup-holder, and gloves in each sleeve. Most of the features themselves aren't particularly new, but the campaign has thrived on great publicity and a savvy marketing hook aimed at busy travelers, notes the tribune.

Sanghavi's jacket was so popular the fund surpassed the $ 20,000 mark in just five hours. \" i knew we had a great idea, that we'd maybe get a million or two, but never $ 9 million, \" said hiral sanghavi, the jacket's creator. The travel jacket comes in four styles and has several hidden functions to make traveling more comfortable. Among the 15 features -- a neck pillow that inflates in seconds, a cup-holder pocket and gloves tucked into each",
            "Hiral sanghavi needed $ 20,000 on kickstarter to fund his baubax travel jacket. He smashed that target and raised a whopping $ 9 million. The crowdfunding campaign for the jacket with 15 built-in features was launched on july 7. Sanghavi had 58 days to meet the goal, but got there in just five hours. The jacket quickly became the most-funded clothing campaign \" not just on kickstarter but in the history of crowdfunding, \" said sanghavi. It wasn't only the most-funded clothing campaign. The baubax jacket drive, which ended thursday, also became kickstarter's fourth-most funded campaign ever after the two pebble smart watches and the multi-purpose coolest cooler box. Related: this jacket does 15 things \" i knew we had a great idea, that we'd maybe get a million or two, but never $ 9 million, \" said sanghavi. The travel jacket comes in four",
            "The baubax travel jacket continues to turn heads on a global scale. By early wednesday, the utility jacket had raised $ 8 million on kickstarter, ranking it sixth in funding in the six-year history of the crowdfunding site. And it still has a little more than a day to go in its month-long effort. It won't catch pebble time, a smartwatch that raised $ 20.3 million in march and became the most highly funded kickstarter campaign ever. But it has a chance to pass the ouya video game console, which raised nearly $ 8.6 million on the crowdfunding platform in 2012. It also trails the coolest cooler, a multipurpose cooler, speaker system and drink maker that raised nearly $ 13.3 million in 2014. Baubax is by far the most successful chicago-based campaign, raising about five times more in pledges than the gramovox floating record, which recently raised $ 1.58 million — good"

Kim dotcom — charged with conspiracy to commit copyright infringement, racketeering, and money-laundering — appeared in a new zealand court today for an extradition hearing in which us prosecutors must prove dotcom and three megaupload employees have a case to answer in the us, reports the ap. Dotcom — who brought his own leather chair for \" ergonomic reasons, \" per the bbc — argues he shouldn't be responsible for users who illegally downloaded songs and movies shared on his site. His lawyers add prosecutors pressed criminal copyright infringement charges only because they were needed for an extradition and apply to people who directly steal, not secondary parties. Since the fbi has frozen tens of millions held in dotcom's accounts, the defense also argues dotcom has been prevented from rousing a strong defense and can't pay his legal bills. The fbi apparently has little sympathy. Officers say dotcom and his associates, mathias ortmann, bram van der kolk, and finn batato, cost film studios and record companies more than $ 500 million in an operation — referred to by the fbi as the \" mega conspiracy \" — that made them $ 175 million, report the bbc and guardian. Each of the men face decades behind bars in the us. Even if us prosecutors are successful in obtaining extradition, it could be months or years before a trial begins in virginia. The hearing — previously delayed nine times, per 3 news — could last four weeks, and each side is likely to appeal an unfavorable decision.",

In a statement released by her office wednesday, the nobel peace prize laureate blamed \" terrorists \" for \" a huge iceberg of misinformation \" about violence targeting rohingya people, at least 146,000 of whom have fled myanmar's rakhine state in the past two weeks, per the guardian. Though un officials and rohingya who reached safety in bangladesh have described up to 1,000 people killed by security forces — satellite images also show a whole community razed, per human rights watch — suu kyi says the government is \" defending all the people in rakhine in the best way possible. \" suu kyi also says \" fake news photographs \" purporting to show dead bodies were taken outside myanmar. A photo tweeted by turkey's deputy prime minister did indeed show a scene from the rwandan genocide of 1994, per the bbc, but a correspondent says much of the misinformation spreading can be attributed to the myanmar government's decision to bar journalists from conflict zones. ( turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has called what's happening in myanmar \" genocide. \" ) the government may also be trying to ensure rohingya who've escaped the country don't return, reports reuters.

Authorities say the first victim, a 13-year-old girl, was attacked at around 4: 40pm yesterday and lost her left arm below the elbow, as well as suffered severe damage to her left leg, nbc news reports. Not much more than an hour later, a 16-year-old was attacked around 2 miles away and lost his left arm below the shoulder, reports wect, which gives the age of the first victim as 12. Both victims are now in stable condition after surgery, authorities say. Oak island's town manager says helicopters will patrol the coastline and beaches will be open today, nbc reports. He says visitors will be encouraged to stay out of the water, though few are likely to need encouragement: witnesses to the aftermath of the first attack tell the ap it was \" nightmarish \" and \" like a scene from jaws. \" experts tell abc news that the severe nature of the injuries suggests that a large shark, possibly a tiger shark, is to blame. \" this is the real deal threat, \" university of florida shark expert george burgess says. \" this is highly unusual — i have seen this twice in 40 years.

In experiments with rats, the test subjects worked much harder to get doses of methylenedioxypyrovalerone — or bath salts — than methamphetamine. The rats pressed a lever an average of 600 times for the former, and just 60 for the latter, livescience reports. \" some rats would even emit 3,000 lever presses for a single hit of mdpv, \" says study author shawn aarbe, per forbes. Of course, rats aren't humans, but \" the drugs that are readily self-administered by rats tend to be the compounds that have abuse liability in humans, \" says one of the researchers, reports livescience. The rats also acted like humans do after taking bath salts, engaging in repetitive behavior akin to people grinding their teeth or picking their skin, forbes reports. \" one stereotyped behavior that we often observed was a rat repeatedly licking the clear plastic walls of its operant chamber — a behavior that was sometimes uninterruptable, \" says aarde. \" one could say mdpv turned some rats into ' window lickers ' of a sort. \"",

            "\" bath salts, \" the recently popular stimulant drugs made with synthetic chemicals, may be more addictive than methamphetamine, one of the most addictive drugs of abuse, a new study on rats suggests. In experiments, rats worked much harder to get an additional dose of the bath-salt compound methylenedioxypyrovalerone ( mdpv ) than they did to get an additional dose of meth: the rats pressed a lever an average of 600 times to get the mdpv compared with an average of 60 times to get the meth. The study also showed that mdpv acts as a classical stimulant in rats. After taking the drug, the rats became highly active and repeatedly licked, bit and sniffed, showing the typical response to stimulants, according to the study, published wednesday ( july 10 ) in the journal neuropharmacology. The findings suggest that mdpv poses an even greater risk of abuse than meth does, the researchers said. \" mdpv is more effective than methamphetamine — it's rewarding, and more pleasurable to the animal, \" said study researcher michael taffe, a psychologist at the scripps research institute. Although rodent studies don't always translate to humans, taffe said \" the drugs that are readily self-administered by rats tend to be the compounds that have abuse liability in humans, \" mdpv compounds in bath salts are derived from cathinone, a stimulant ingredient also found in a recently banned plant called khat. For centuries, khat leaves have been used as a recreational drug in eastern africa and the arabian peninsula. In the 2000s, synthesized derivatives of cathinone emerged in several countries, including the united states and canada, and were sold over-the-counter before they were banned. Mdpv, like many other stimulants, affects three of the major neurotransmitters in the brain: dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin. Molecules of the drug attach themselves to the proteins in the brain that clear up the excess neurotransmitters and, therefore, disrupt brain systems that control mood, pleasure, movement and cognition. People who have used the drug report common stimulant effects — euphoria, increased physical activity, an inability to sleep and decreased appetite — as well as a craving for more use. In the study, some rats received infusions of meth, while others received mdpv. The animals learned that pressing a lever would release a dose of the drug. When their supply was cut, they kept pressing the lever and were sometimes rewarded with more. The dose of mdpv to which rats started responding was markedly lower",

        "summary": "A man attacked a woman in a hotel hallway sunday in beijing for minutes on end as hotel staff and other guests ignored the situation, the washington post reports. Video of the attack has since gone viral on chinese social media, bringing attention to the country's issues with sexism and violence against women. The victim, who identified herself as wanwan on social media, was looking for her room key after stepping out of an elevator when the man attacked her. He grabbed her, choked her, and attempted to drag her down a stairwell. At least four other guests got off the elevator in the middle of the attack and did nothing. Wanwan says a hotel employee intervened only to ask her to quiet down. The attacker finally ran off when a woman reached out to help wanwan up off the ground. The response to the video has been almost as disturbing as the attack itself. China's people's daily online implies the attack wouldn't have been noteworthy if it was \" just another brawl between lovers \" or \" just another couple arguing. \" the post notes anti-domestic violence laws were only recently passed in china. Wanwan, who called police dispatchers in the middle of the attack, says she was told it wasn't \" within our responsibility. \" she was later told she would have to wait days for an investigator to look into it. And an initial investigation by police minimizes the attack, saying wanwan wasn't injured or robbed and the attacker \" seemed drunk. \" china.or.cn reports the hotel issued a statement after the video went viral claiming staff tried to stop the fight. It also allegedly tried to bribe wanwan to delete the video.",

It's a skill on which the administration will rely as it seeks to bring reluctant republican house leaders to a compromise on raising the debt ceiling and, in the process, to save president barack obama's — and lew's — vision of a government with the resources to conduct nation building at home. \"no one was more prepared",

President obama made the news official this afternoon in a brief appearance in the state dining room of the white house, where he told reporters in somber tones that he is sorry to see daley leave. \" there's no question i will deeply miss having bill at my side here at the white house, \" obama said. \" but chicago is only a phone call away. \" after accepting daley's resignation last week, the president said, he asked for advice on a replacement. \" he told me there was one clear choice, \" obama said, \" and i believe he's right. \" lew was the first and only choice for the job, aides to the president say.

Clearly shown in the video, however, was the suspect's \" redrum \" neck tattoo ( in a meta twist, hewett also has the state of florida inked onto his temple, which likely also stood out ).

If you reverse the letters, it spells the word ' murder. ' \" investigators were able to match the tatted man in the video with hewett based on an id from the homeowner ( he'd met hewett before ) and info found in the palm beach county jail's tattoo database. Hewett was arrested on charges of burglary, grand theft, and possession of a weapon by a felon, as he'd been in prison before for a robbery conviction and other weapons-related charges.

Many of the aforementioned asteroids exploded high in the atmosphere or in remote locations, but that's just \" blind luck, \" the narrator says. An early warning infrared space telescope could be used to track asteroids, and would spot them while they were still millions of miles and many years away from the planet, the video explains.

More of silverstone's ideas, from the ap, huffington post, daily beast, and new york daily news: don't use tampons: \" your chichi is the most absorbent part of your body. Unfortunately, feminine-care manufacturers aren't required to tell you what's in their products, which means that no one's talking about the potential pesticide residues from non-organic cotton and the 'fragrances ' containing hormone-upsetting, fertility-knocking phthalates that are snuggling up to your hoo-ha. \" go vegan: silverstone suggests a diet free of animal products can cure fertility problems, lower your risk of a miscarriage, help guard against postpartum depression, and improve babies ' nutrition via breastfeeding. ( she also suggests processed sugars contribute to postpartum depression. ) ditch the diapers: \" infants who are left in their diapers all day get out of tune with their bodies... Because they get used to walking around in a toilet, by the time you want to take that diaper away, it can be pretty difficult for a small child to relearn how to pay attention to this need and do something about it... So step away from the pampers, \" which, she says, are backed by \" pseudoscience. \" instead, she suggests you use \" elimination communication \" to potty-train your baby. For crying out loud, share a bed with your baby: i mean, would you really want to leave him in a crib, aka \" a barred-in box completely alone \"? and for that matter, stay in that bed with baby for a long time after birth: silverstone's \" lying-in period \" lasted 10 days. Remember, silverstone also recommends feeding your baby mouth-to-mouth.",

The death toll remains at 10, including five high school students who were on their way to visit humboldt state university, reports the los angeles times. Among those dead were two adult chaperones on the bus, michael myvett and mattison haywood, who had recently gotten engaged in paris, reports the ap. At least one of the injured passengers remains in critical condition. A california highway patrol official said investigators were looking into whether the truck driver fell asleep before the crash at 5: 40pm, had a mechanical failure, or perhaps had another accident that caused him to cross the median. Authorities say the truck clipped a nissan altima before hitting the tour bus, but the two occupants of the car suffered only minor injuries. It's unclear whether the truck was out of control before that happened. Meanwhile, a teen who was aboard the bus said it had been running late, in part because it had been involved in an earlier, minor accident. The teen, calvin aceves, said he fell asleep after boarding and woke to the sounds of the crash. \"i just heard the screaming, and i was halfway asleep so i thought i was dreaming, \" he told the bee. \"i turned my head a little and i see fire.

A pennsylvania clinic had considered euthanizing the abused kitten, which was lethargic and suffering head trauma, but it revived after it was treated with narcan, a drug generally used to treat overdoses in humans, reports the philadelphia daily news. The kitten has been nicknamed \" hope \" and will be transferred for adoption after it has made a full recovery. Police found the kitten next to the car of 24-year-old suspect james myers in the town of west whiteland early sunday morning, main line media news reports. It had a rope tied around its neck and had several teeth knocked out. \" we don't know if it was being dragged behind the car or was being slammed down, but it had substantial amounts of trauma to it, \" the district attorney says. He adds that myers had 22 bags of heroin on him, and hundreds of used bags were found in his car, along with 46 hypodermic needles, reports fox. Myers has been charged with drug possession and animal cruelty.",

The purpose is \" to see how deep the roots of this storm go, and help us understand how this giant storm works and what makes it so special, \" he notes. Juno will hover about 5,600 miles above the maelstrom's crimson clouds. \" each new orbit brings us closer to the heart of jupiter's radiation belt, \" adds nasa's rick nybakken, per phys.org. He adds that so far juno has tolerated a pounding by electrons \" better than we could have ever imagined. \" with eight instruments and a color junocam, the craft's data collection will be boosted by detailed images obtained in may by two powerful telescopes in hawaii pointed at jupiter. The great red spot, which has been regularly observed since 1830, has fascinated earthlings ever since and \" is probably the best-known feature of jupiter, \" says bolton.

Other reactions: in a blog post headlined \" bernanke wimps out, \" paul krugman doesn't get why the fed isn't being more aggressive. Bernanke said he was worried about the \" tradeoff \" with inflation. \" i think the only way to read it is to say that he has been intimidated by the inflationistas, and is looking for excuses not to act. \" \" in immediate terms, the press conference was a success, \" writes robin harding in the financial times. \" mr bernanke smoothly answered relevant questions without departing far from the fed's script or comments that it has made in the past. \" in the long term, it's possible the pressers could call attention to \" gaps \" in fed policy.",

Police in portage., ind., soon after were called to the csx railroad tracks just south of a mobile-home park, where they made an awful find: a 3-year-old boy who'd been killed by the train, with his injured 2-year-old sister nearby, the times of northwest indiana reports. Caleb wilson was pronounced dead at the scene, while ellie wilson was airlifted to a chicago hospital. The little girl was in critical condition with a head injury, though an aunt notes ellie was awake and talking as of tuesday evening. Portage police chief troy williams says the train conductor spotted the children at the last minute, leaned on the horn, and tried to get the train to stop, but it was too late. Now investigators are trying to piece together how caleb and ellie got out on the tracks. Williams says relatives who were home with the kids think they slipped out through a screen door without any adults noticing, and that family members were trying to find the kids when the train came through. The children's mobile home is only four homes down from the tracks, with no fencing or other barrier keeping anyone from climbing up the steep hill to the tracks. \" caleb loves trains and, of course, little ellie follows caleb everywhere, \" a relative tells the times. The porter county coroner has issued a warning in the wake of the tragedy, asking parents of little ones to \" please keep a vigilant eye on their children during these summer months when they are more likely to roam outside, \" per the chicago tribune.",

Jeffries woke up at 3: 50am with one thought on her mind: \"this sucks. \" she shlepped to \"the far side of queens, \" where the buses were supposed to board by 5: 30am, and it soon became clear that there would be no free coffee, donuts, or gift bags: \"the huffington post was not prepared to give us anything beyond a bus ride. And even that seemed far from certain, \" she writes on salon — but she quickly got caught up in the \" giddy \" crowd. Her bus was supposed to leave at 6am, but jeffries didn't even board until 7: 15; it then crawled through traffic for hours before finally reaching dc — an hour late, after jon stewart was already on stage — and by the time she navigated the overcrowded metro the rest of the way to the national mall, there was no way to get close to the stage. Even so, it was hard not to be in a good mood among the \"good-natured \" crowd, she writes. By contrast, matlin had a relatively cushy ride, aboard the same bus as huffington herself.

Following two hours of testimony and arguments, judge mckeon sentenced blake to 30 years in the montana prison system, with all 30 years suspended. Blake will be required to meet a number of conditions, including registering as a sex offender. Testimony began with probation and parole officer pam heikens, who explained some aspects of the plea agreement. Much of the remaining testimony centered around blake and risk assessments completed by a licensed clinical social worker, michael sullivan. Sullivan testified that blake would benefit from community-based sex-offender treatment and described him as a low-risk for recidivism with effective treatment. He also indicated that it would be important for him to have social support during his treatment, noting that after his arrest, blake did suffer the \"collapse of social support \" when he lost his family and his job, among other things. During his testimony, blake indicated that he is currently living with his mother and stepdad, is employed, and attends church every sunday. His testimony was confirmed when his mother took the stand and indicated, \"my son is welcome at my home for any time that he needs."

With a handful of supporters seated behind him in the courtroom, martin blake, 40, appeared before judge john c. Mckeon. Following two hours of testimony and arguments, judge mckeon sentenced blake to 30 years in the montana prison system, with all 30 years suspended. Blake will be required to meet a number of conditions, including registering as a sex offender. Testimony began with probation and parole officer pam heikens, who explained some aspects of the plea agreement. Much of the remaining testimony centered around blake and risk assessments completed by a licensed clinical social worker, michael sullivan. Sullivan testified that blake would benefit from community-based sex-offender treatment and described him as a low-risk for recidivism with effective treatment. He also indicated that it would be important for him to have social support during his treatment, noting that after his arrest, blake did suffer the \"collapse of social support \" when he lost his family and his job, among other things. During his testimony, blake indicated that he is currently living with his mother and stepdad, is employed, and attends church every sunday. His testimony was confirmed when his mother took the stand and indicated, \"my son is welcome at my home for any time that he needs."

The data recorder — which should hold at least 12 hours of recordings of final communications as well as navigational data — failed to turn up during an initial, weeks-long search in january but was finally spotted in april, before a remotely operated vehicle was able to retrieve it on monday, reports the ap. Officials will begin their study of the device when crews return to the us around friday and hope it will shed light on the sinking, which killed all 33 crew — 28 americans and five polish nationals, per cnn — sailing from florida to puerto rico. The device \" has the potential to give our investigators greater insight into the incredible challenges that the el faro crew faced, but it's just one component of a very complex investigation, \" says the chairman of the national transportation safety board. Testimony during hearings by a coast guard marine board earlier this year revealed capt. Michael davidson chose to sail close to hurricane joaquin rather than take a longer route. The ship's owner, tote services inc., says he was under no pressure to do so. The ship was found upright in october with its bridge detached, suggesting it sank quickly, per the atlantic.

For mawuna remarque koutonin, writing at the guardian, it's evidence that \" in the lexicon of human migration, there are still hierarchical words, created with the purpose of putting white people above everyone else. \" given that expatriate means basically \" out of the fatherland, \" one would \" expect that any person going to work outside of his or her country for a period of time would be an expat. \" but that's decidedly not the case, writes koutonin. \" africans are immigrants.

Koutonin points to the wall street journal's expat blog, and one post in which a canadian living in hong kong ponders the nuance thusly: \" some arrivals are described as expats; others as immigrants; and some, simply migrants, \" and ultimately that designation \" depends on social class, country of origin, and economic status. \" when koutonin spots \" expats \" in africa, he's going to \" call them immigrants like everyone else, \" so we can complete \" the political deconstruction of this outdated worldview. \" click for his full column.",

        "summary": "Another day, another accusation to emerge from election 2016 — this one to be hurled by donald trump rather than at him. An advisor says the republican nominee is planning to claim the sexual misconduct allegations he's facing are the work in part of mexican billionaire carlos slim, who holds a significant number of shares in the new york times, which first reported on the alleged encounters, and who has donated somewhere between $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 to the clinton foundation, per the wall street journal. The claim would be a step up from trump's accusation earlier this year that slim is using the times \" to influence american policy, \" reports politico. Slim made it clear last year that he's no fan of trump, but the claim that he's helping hillary clinton's campaign \" is totally false, \" his rep says. \" of course we aren't interfering in the us election. We aren't even active in mexican politics. \" times publisher arthur sulzberger jr. Likewise says slim — one of the world's richest people with an estimated $ 50 billion net worth — \" fully respects boundaries regarding the independence of our journalism \" and \" has never sought to influence what we report. \" clinton's press secretary adds this \" is just another deranged right-wing conspiracy theory from donald trump's increasingly desperate campaign. \"",

City resident lorri tamburro told the stamford advocate that she found it disturbing to see children climbing on the statue's leg and looking up the skirt. \" i just find the position to be offensive, \" she says. \" i looked at it, and i think because of what i saw with all these little kids looking up, the height is ruining it.
