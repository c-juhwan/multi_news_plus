        "summary": "The mars rover has delivered what a nasa scientist calls an \" oh my gosh moment \" — it detected methane on the red planet, reports the new york times. The discovery is making headlines because the gas had to originate somewhere, and one possibility is that the source is some form of microbial life, reports the guardian. \"that we detect methane in the atmosphere on mars is not an argument that we have found evidence of life on mars, but it's one of the few hypotheses that we can propose that we must consider, \" says scientist john grotzinger of the curiosity team. The rover picked up spikes in the levels of methane that disappeared in a matter of weeks. The source, however, could be geological rather than biological, explains national geographic: \" interactions between water and rock could produce methane, as could sunlight cooking off meteorite debris on the martian surface. \" it's also possible that even if microbes did create the methane, the bugs are long gone, reports the bbc. The gas could have been trapped underground eons ago, and it surfaces periodically because of thermal disturbances. The best hope for real answers is if curiosity happens to detect a large amount of the gas that can be properly analyzed. Today's news is all the more surprising because nasa announced just last year that the rover could find no methane at all.",

Then i found a new mac voice named alex, who sounded like he knew when a sentence had ended. One day i was moseying around the web and found the name of a company in edinburgh named cereproc. They claimed they could build voices for specific customers. They had demos of the voices of george w. Bush and arnold schwarzenegger.

The company will give the retirees an annual payment, and they ' ll use it pick their own plan from a privately run medicare exchange called extend health. It's similar in concept to the public exchanges being set up under obamacare and a \" sign that even big, well-capitalized employers aren't likely to keep providing the once-common benefits as medical costs continue to rise, \" reports the wall street journal. Ibm says it's doing so because premiums would rise to unmanageable levels for retirees if it remained under the current system. The theory behind the exchanges is that multiple insurers will compete to offer the best plans and thus keep costs down. Other big companies such as dupont and caterpillar also have made the switch to exchanges for retirees, and some, including sears, have done so for current employees as well, notes the journal.",

            "A worker is pictured behind a logo at the ibm stand on the cebit computer fair in hanover february 26, 2011. ( reuters ) - ibm plans to move u.s. Retirees off its company-sponsored health plan and shift them into new private insurance exchanges as a way of lowering costs for retirees. Ibm had selected extend health, which is owned by towers watson &amp; co, to provide retirees with new health options for medical, prescription drug, dental and vision coverage, the company said in a statement on friday. The plan, it said, offered ibm retirees more choice and better value than the company could provide through existing group plans. Ibm also said it was hosting meetings with groups of retirees across the country to inform them about the move to the country's largest private medicare exchange.

            "A worker is pictured behind a logo at the ibm stand on the cebit computer fair in hanover february 26, 2011. ( reuters ) - ibm plans to move u.s. Retirees off its company-sponsored health plan and shift them into new private insurance exchanges as a way of lowering costs for retirees. Ibm had selected extend health, which is owned by towers watson &amp; co, to provide retirees with new health options for medical, prescription drug, dental and vision coverage, the company said in a statement on friday. The plan, it said, offered ibm retirees more choice and better value than the company could provide through existing group plans. Ibm also said it was hosting meetings with groups of retirees across the country to inform them about the move to the country's largest private medicare exchange.

The \" art and china after 1989: theater of the world \" showing, which will feature about 150 works from chinese artists, came under fire for a handful of pieces that included live animals or insects, infuriating animal rights activists. Per the new york times, the nyc museum decided monday to yank those three works after protests and an online petition, with the museum noting in a statement the removals were necessary \" out of concern for the safety of its staff, visitors, and participating artists \" due to \" explicit and repeated threats of violence. \" the exhibit with the most pushback: \" dogs that cannot touch each other, \" a piece by husband-and-wife team sun yuan and peng yu that included video of pit bulls trying to charge each other ( but not being allowed to make contact ). Also yanked: \" a case study of transference, \" which would've shown video of two pigs having sex, and \" theater of the world, \" which had planned to showcase live insects and reptiles skittering about under a lamp. The museum was initially steadfast about keeping the works, but public outcry escalated, with the guardian noting even celebrities like ricky gervais and richard marx were decrying the pieces as cruel to animals. Huang yong ping, the artist behind \" theater of the world, \" tells the times he hadn't been aware his piece was being pulled until the paper informed him ( he had no comment ), and peng simply said, \" i don't want to talk about this anymore \" when the paper reached her. The museum says it's \" dismayed \" it had to remove the works. \" freedom of expression has always been and will remain a paramount value of the guggenheim, \" its statement notes.",

Reuters/kevin lamarque washington ( reuters ) - president donald trump denied on wednesday that the planned relocation of the u.s. Embassy in israel to jerusalem would take place within a year, after prime minister benjamin netanyahu said he expected the controversial move to happen by then. Reversing decades of u.s.

        "summary": "Jo gilchrist borrowed a friend's makeup brush recently, using it to sweep makeup onto her face — including over a pimple. Soon after, in february, she noticed a \" dull ache \" in her body. Initially unconcerned, the 27-year-old australian called a doctor when she was in such pain she couldn't get out of bed. Ultimately she learned that she had contracted mrsa, an antibiotic-resistant staph infection; the bacteria had likely gotten in via the makeup brush and the pimple. As the warwick daily news explains, about a third of healthy people have staph bacteria on their skin; the independent notes that for those people, the bacteria typically \" colonize \" without causing any symptoms. Cbs news says 2 % of people are carriers of the antibiotic-resistant version. Doctors told gilchrist her immune system simply couldn't fight off the infection. Days after her first doctor visit, gilchrist started losing feeling in her legs. Doctors told her the infection had damaged her spine and would leave her unable to walk, but she says she's managed to get \" a wiggle out of my toes \" and is determined to prove them wrong, though she's currently wheelchair-bound and will likely reside in princess alexandra hospital's spinal ward for at least three more months — during which her son will turn 3. \" it will feel like a lifetime, but at least i will get to go home to him in july and it will be ok, \" she says. A video posted on her facebook page on march 30 shows her moving her legs and briefly standing and walking with support, and she notes in the description, \" as hard as it has been [ i ' m ] so lucky to have muscle power and no feeling [ rather ] than the other way around! \" ( this mom was killed in a freak driveway accident. )",

The composer asked, on his deathbed in 1849 at age 39, that his heart be buried not in france, but in his native poland ( nature reports that he feared being buried alive ). And so it was done, with the ap in 2014 reporting on the heart's very secret exhumation on april 14 of that year from a pillar in holy cross church in warsaw. The scientists who participated took more than 1,000 photos of the organ, which sat pickled in a jar of alcohol, before bolstering the seal with hot wax and returning it to the pillar. That this happened at all wasn't revealed for five months, and now, three years later, a draft of an article published in the american journal of medicine asserts the mystery of his death has been solved: a complication of tuberculosis, scientists say. The guardian calls the article \" the latest and most convincing foray into the long-running dispute \" over what ate away at chopin's health throughout his 30s, with other theories including cystic fibrosis or a genetic disease that could have increased the risk of lung infections. Though the jar with his heart remained sealed, just by viewing its state \" we can say, with high probability, that chopin suffered from tuberculosis while the complication pericarditis was probably the immediate cause of his death, \" says team leader michal witt. What they spotted: a white coating that makes it look \" frosted, \" per the new york times, along with small lesions. Nature notes some continue to doubt the heart is even chopin's.

        "summary": "Robert mueller's team is interested in president trump's attacks last summer on jeff sessions — whom trump reportedly likens to an elderly, bumbling cartoon character — and his team has been questioning people to that end, sources tell the washington post. Mueller is probing whether trump tried to obstruct justice as part of the special counsel's investigation into links between trump's campaign and russia, and the investigation has already found that trump pressured sessions not to recuse himself from the justice department's russia investigation in march 2017, per the new york times. People familiar with the matter say mueller aims to learn whether comments trump made about sessions in late july and early august were part of an effort to force him out and install a replacement who would intervene in the investigation. Trump publicly described a \" beleaguered \" sessions as having a \" very weak position on hillary clinton crimes \" in july; the post claims trump privately refers to him as mr. Magoo and complained his attorney general wasn't as loyal as he should be. One white house adviser describes trump as \" stunned \" that his harsh comments didn't spur sessions'resignation. But sessions has dug his heels in, and apparently famously so: the paper reports aides marked the anniversary of his confirmation by gifting him a personalized bulletproof vest. Trump has continued to attack sessions: a week ago, he appeared to blame sessions for a lack of an investigation into democrats ' \" crimes. \" on wednesday, he attacked sessions again. New york offers a history of their feud.",

As of early this afternoon, the tbi has received more than 450 leads.

            "One week ago today, elizabeth thomas vanished from columbia, tennessee. Our efforts to locate her – and the man believed to have kidnapped her – remain active and ongoing, but to this point have produced no credible sightings or actionable information about their whereabouts. The individuals could be anywhere, and the tbi continues to urge national vigilance in the ongoing effort to locate the missing girl and apprehend her alleged abductor. Thomas, 15, disappeared on monday, march 13th and is believed to have been kidnapped by 50-year-old tad cummins, a former teacher at her school in maury county, tennessee. On tuesday, the school district in maury county terminated cummins in the wake of an ongoing investigation into alleged inappropriate contact he had with thomas at the school earlier this year. As of early this afternoon, the tbi has received more than 450 leads. The lack of confirmed sightings, however, continues to lead tbi to believe cummins could have thomas hidden from view of the general public or far away from tennessee. Thomas is a 15-year-old white female, with hazel eyes, stands 5 ' 0 \" and weighs 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings.

        "summary": "In what one epidemiologist calls a \" slow-rolling disaster, \" a new set of studies presented at an american thoracic society conference this week offered glum news for coal miners. Per npr, more appalachian miners are plagued by both early- and late-stage pneumoconiosis, or \" black lung disease, \" than previous research suggested. Sifting through nearly 50 years of federal benefit claims linked to the respiratory illness caused by inhaled coal mine dust, kirsten almberg and robert cohen, co-authors of one study, found more than 4,600 cases of progressive massive fibrosis ( the most severe stage of the illness ), with more than 50 % of them taking place over the past 16 years. And david blackley, a scientist at the national institute for occupational safety and health, which has conducted the government tracking program, says his initiative has recently spotted more early stage black lung as well. \" it's not that we're discovering a new disease, \" cohen tells npr. \" we're seeing a resurgence of a disease that should have been eradicated. \" one study cited at the ats meeting noted miners with simple black lung continued to see deteriorating lung function after they ceased going into the mines, meaning they may eventually get pmf. That study also noted a growing number of lung transplants in pmf patients. Why the numbers have been so underreported: previous niosh studies have relied on voluntary testing by working miners only, with about 60 % of miners never getting diagnostic x-rays. Newer research also looked at black lung clinics. A 2016 cdc study backs up claims of a pmf resurgence. \" we've gone from having nearly eradicated pmf in the mid-1990s to the highest concentration of cases that anyone has ever seen, \" a niosh epidemiologist recently told npr.

Rumain brisbon, 34, was shot dead tuesday night by an officer who says he mistook a pill bottle in the man's pocket for a gun as he struggled with him after a chase, the arizona republic reports. According to the washington post, brisbon was shot inside his family's apartment in the presence of his girlfriend and 15-month-old child. Police say brisbon was a suspected drug dealer who ran away when he was ordered to put his hands up. \" this one went bad from the standpoint of how it ended, but the officer was doing exactly what we want him to do, \" which is investigate reports of crime at that apartment complex, a police spokesman says. Investigators say they recovered marijuana and a handgun from brisbon's suv, the ap reports. Friends and relatives say brisbon, a father of four, was just delivering food to his children, and a lawyer for the family says witnesses dispute the police account. \" what happened here is a police officer murdered my client, \" she tells the post. \" and what the police say happened, it doesn't make any sense at all. There's something not right with it. \" a friend who witnessed some of the incident tells the republic that he never saw the officer try to talk to brisbon. \" who's gonna argue with police? \" he says. \" he had no death wish. \" in nearby tempe, police say they've canceled tomorrow's \" run from the cops 5k \" fundraising race out of \" sensitivity, respect, and support for all sides of an important debate taking place all across our country, \" reports abc15.",

Border patrol custody -- though officials say she hadn't eaten or consumed water for several days before the arrest. U.s. Sen. Kamala harris, d-calif., a likely leading 2020 contender, immediately jumped on the news, calling for the investigation. \"this is tragic.

Cory booker, d-n.j., another possible 2020 contender, also issued a tweet amid the reports. \"shaken by this news. My heart breaks for this young girl and her family, \" he wrote. The girl, originally from guatemala, was part of a 163 migrant group that crossed the u.s.-mexico border illegally and surrendered to the border agents dec. 6.

That's because the first lady was seen boarding a presidential helicopter wearing stilettos. The criticism came quickly, with a common refrain being that the first lady looked insensitive and out of touch. Then came the backlash, with defenders criticizing those critics for focusing on fashion choices in dire times. By the time the first lady landed in texas, she had switched to sneakers. \"it's sad that we have an active and ongoing natural disaster in texas, and people are worried about her shoes, \" said a spokeswoman for the first lady. As the washington post notes, one of the first lady's most surprising public defenders turned out to be trevor noah. \" i don't know why anyone should care what anyone wears when they're on their way to help people, \" he said on his show. \" who cares? look at the pope, you see how he dresses? all white … he looks like he's going to a p diddy party. But we don't say, hey he can't go out helping people dressed like that. \" another defender was none other than kathy griffin: \" there are many reasons the trump administration concerns me, \" she tweeted. \" melania trump's shoes aren't one of them. \" but for every sentiment like those is one like this: \" it was a mistake in the message it relays, \" a stylist who worked with sarah palin during the 2008 campaign tells politico. \" she should be dressed accordingly. \" for the record, the shoes appeared to be \" classic manolo blahniks, \" note the new york times in its assessment of the brouhaha and the deeper meaning of the \" telling detail. \"",

Then her dream of finally bearing children was put on hold — if not dashed — by something that forced doctors to remove the transplant. Turns out it was nothing more than a common yeast infection, the new york times reports. The 26-year-old texas resident, who has three adopted boys, made headlines in march when her recovery from surgery seemed to be going well at the cleveland clinic. \" i was 16 and was told i would never have children and from that moment on, i've prayed that god would allow me that opportunity to experience pregnancy, \" she said in a wheelchair beside her husband blake, per cnn. \" and here we are today at the beginning of that journey. \" but after about two weeks, she suddenly started to bleed. Facing a yeast infection that blocked blood flow to the uterus, doctors had to remove the transplant. Sadly, the very drugs mcfarland was taking to prevent organ rejection also stopped her immune system from staving off an infection — even one that women typically treat with over-the-counter drugs. \" it was extremely disappointing for our entire team and, more importantly, for the patient and her family, \" one of her surgeons tells the cleveland plain dealer. The cleveland clinic has put its uterus-transplant project on hold, but on the bright side, swedish doctors have performed lasting uterus transplants, and three more us medical centers are planning their own programs. As for mcfarland, she's recovering again. \" if in the future we're successful and she wants to have another protocol, it might be possible, \" says the lead doctor on her surgical team. \" technically, it's possible. \" ( read about a woman who lost her vision from weight-loss surgery. )",

But immigration advocates say that while \" merit-based \" immigration sounds good, it can be used as a tool to drastically reduce all legal immigration, especially the low-skilled workers necessary for farming and more. Canada adopted an immigration system in the 1960s that awards prospective immigrants points for education, language skills, work experience, and more. The result is that most of canada's immigrants are there for economic reasons. Meanwhile, most legal immigrants in the us are here because of family connections.

The volatile turn of events came as mostly latino protesters flooded the state capitol in austin on the legislature's final day, explains the texas observer. They were protesting the state's new law against sanctuary cities, one that requires local governments to enforce federal immigration laws. ( see a video of the protest here. ) the dallas morning news reports that at one point amid the protest, gop rep. Matt rinaldi approached reps. Ramon romero and cesar blanco on the house floor and told them he had called immigration and customs enforcement on the protesters. That led to a shoving match, with both sides accusing the other of making threats of violence. One democratic lawmaker, justin rodriguez, says he heard rinaldi say, \" i ' ll put a bullet in your head \" to rep. Poncho nevárez. And later on facebook, rinaldi acknowledged making such a threat, but in self defense. He says nevárez threatened to \" get me on the way to my car, \" adding that \" i made it clear that if he attempted to, in his words, ' get me, ' i would shoot him in self defense. \" rinaldi, who says he called ice because some of the protesters were holding signs declaring themselves to be \" illegal, \" also accused romero of physically assaulting him. On twitter, nevárez called rinaldi \" a liar and hateful man. \" another lawmaker, republican pat fallon, witnessed the initial shoving match and tried to break it up. \" i just walked right into the middle, and i was begging them, ' people, please, not on the house floor.

Then it took another quarter-century for tests to be funded and performed, but they're now telling the story of racton man in pretty gritty detail. He lived around 4,200 years ago, was in his 40s at the time of his death, and was likely a prominent warrior who died in battle, reports the guardian. He managed to live well past the average life expectancy of his time but was suffering the effects ( spinal degeneration, tooth decay, and a chronic sinus infection ), and the bronze dagger he held is thought to be the earliest ever found in the uk. \" dagger burials of any kind are rare, and these daggers are hens'teeth rare, \" says an expert on bronze age metalwork. \" it was a very short-lived fashion, certainly no more than a few generations. \" thanks to isotope analysis on racton man's teeth, scientists say he grew up in southern britain, and thanks to radiocarbon dating, he was found to have lived during the bronze age, reports the bbc. \" to think that we can discover such detail about a man who died more than 4,000 years ago, while learning more about the country's history, is just incredible, \" says myles cullen, a cabinet member for the chichester district council, which helped fund the research. The bronze dagger is considered exceedingly rare; it includes a wooden hilt, which has rotted away but was once adorned with small, decorative studs that likely sparkled like gold.

After a week of silence, ford addressed the controversy that began when three journalists — two from the toronto star and one from gawker — reported that they had seen a video of an inebriated ford smoking from a crack pipe. Ford's comments today, from the star and toronto sun: \"there has been a serious accusation from the toronto star that i use crack cocaine. I do not use crack cocaine nor am i an addict of crack cocaine. \" \"as for a video, i cannot comment on a video that i have never seen or does not exist. It is most unfortunate, very unfortunate that my colleagues and the great people of this city have been exposed to the fact that i have been judged by the media without any evidence. \" so what to make of this? you can parse it for yourself, but john cook at gawker thinks ford chose his words carefully. He did not, for example, say that he has never smoked crack, only that he does not do so currently. That he denied being an addict is irrelevant — nobody said he was. And ford chose not to comment on the video instead of denying it was him. Nothing he said, in other words, \" is inconsistent with rob ford having been caught on tape smoking crack cocaine within the past six months. \" ( cook and the star reporters were given a chance to buy the video but did not do so.

In another example, 54 % of married parents read to three- to five-year-olds every day, while cohabiting unmarried parents read daily at a similar rate of 50 %. Big differences centered instead on whether a family faced poverty; livescience offers examples centering on kids ' involvement in activities.

Trump instructed federal agencies to \" waive, defer, grant ­exemptions from or delay \" any aspects of the law that would \" impose a financial burden. \" some coverage of what that might mean: perhaps the biggest issue at play is the fate of the individual mandate, which requires people to buy insurance, reports buzzfeed. If agencies provide widespread exemptions, it could roil insurance markets. Indeed, trump adviser kellyanne conway said sunday that the white house may try to stop enforcement of the provision even before congress acts, reports bloomberg. If trump kills or weakens the mandate, \" it's hard to overstate how destructive this decision would be \" to the law, per an analysis at slate. It calls the mandate the \" keystone \" of the affordable care act, but adds that it's not clear how far trump can go on the matter without congress. Cnn provides examples of what trump's executive order can do, including giving states more leeway on how they run their programs. One vulnerability of obamacare is that an unusually large portion of it is in place as the result of executive action rather than congress, explains politico. That's a result of democrats losing their supermajority in the senate with the election of scott brown in 2010. For now, trump's action is the equivalent of tossing a \" bomb \" into the \" already shaky \" insurance market, a consultant tells the washington post. Congress, meanwhile, will continue working on repeal-and-replace legislation, but it's a safe bet that a jan. 27 deadline for committees to present their particular sections of a new bill will be missed.

But cnn reports that only 30 or so of the ship's 250 available beds are occupied, and that its surgery facilities, medical staff, and supplies have barely been tapped, all due to confusion and red tape on transporting hurricane victims to the vessel. The issues seem to revolve around the protocol in getting patients onto the ship — which hillary clinton referenced on twitter last month, urging the us government to send it to puerto rico asap. Patients apparently have to be referred by the territory's department of health, and the referrals haven't been coming, as medical staff don't seem to know exactly what to do. \" the disconnect or the apparent disconnect [ is ] in the communications flow, \" ricardo rossello says, vowing to overhaul the process.

        "summary": "\" sacrococcygeal teratoma \" are not the words you want to hear during a pregnancy ultrasound, but that's what margaret boemer was confronted with when she went for her 16-week checkup. In an interview shared by texas children's hospital with cnn, the texas mom, who already had three kids at home, was told during that doctor's visit that her fetus had a rare condition in which a tumor grows out of the base of the tailbone. Although the fetus can sometimes withstand the tumor until after birth, it can compete for blood to the point of killing the fetus, says dr. Darrell cass of texas children's fetal center. Boemer had already had complications, and she didn't want to terminate the pregnancy, as some doctors suggested — so her baby was \" born \" twice instead. Translation: boemer opted for risky fetal surgery in which the fetus, by then almost 24 weeks, was taken out of her uterus in a five-hour procedure. The fetus was \" hanging out in the air, \" cass explains, while doctors removed most of the tumor; people notes the fetus was outside of the womb for about 20 minutes. Doctors then returned the fetus back to its corporeal home and stitched everything back up. Per nbc chicago, blood started flowing normally, and little lynlee was born healthy via c-section at 36 weeks in june. Doctors removed the tumor remnants when lynlee was eight days old, and now, at 4 months, she's recuperating at home after a few weeks in the nicu. ( fetal surgery to treat birth defects was the subject of a landmark study. )",

Aussie-speak developed in the early days of colonial settlement from a cocktail of english, irish, aboriginal and german – before another mystery influence was slipped into the mix. The australian alphabet cocktail was spiked by alcohol. Our forefathers regularly got drunk together and through their frequent interactions unknowingly added an alcoholic slur to our national speech patterns. For the past two centuries, from generation to generation, drunken aussie-speak continues to be taught by sober parents to their children. Share share tweet link we must reclaim rhetoric as an important fixture of australian culture, teach it to all students in our schools and raise our standards of communication.

        "summary": "A lack of trust between the united states and pakistan was the key culprit in a series of blunders that resulted in the killing of 24 pakistani soldiers on nov. 26, reports the wall street journal. Us forces made two major errors that day: not informing the pakistanis that the 150-man border operation was taking place and, when they checked with pakistani officials to authorize the subsequent airstrikes, they accidentally provided the wrong coordinates, off by 9 miles. Pakistan, too, made mistakes, most significantly withholding information about the location of its border posts — a finding that isn't likely to sit well with pakistan, which was enraged by the incident. Us officials also contend that pakistani forces fired first and should have known from the fighter jets and gunships that their patrol wasn't insurgents, and pakistani officials refused to take part in the investigation. \"the message we're trying to convey tonight is that were some pretty serious breakdowns all around, \" an american official told the new york times. \"how does pakistan react? we hope we can start moving forward. \"",

The uk satellite firm inmarsat figured out in a day that the flight likely crashed where crews are now searching, but rescue teams didn't know for 10 days — and relatives of passengers are outraged. They called malaysia airlines and the malaysian government \" the real executioners. \" inmarsat determined the flight's path in a unique way, receiving hourly signals by satellite and studying waves coming from the plane to determine whether it was getting closer or moving away, cnn reports. It's like the doppler effect — the difference in sound between a vehicle approaching and driving off.

        "summary": "The goal was just, the execution anything but: in the 1940s, the us government pulled together an operation designed to find a cure for malaria, which infected some 500,000 american troops during wwii. How they went about doing so is revealed in karen masterson's new book, the malaria project, which reports on the operation of the same name. Making use of national archives records, masterson documents how us troops and mental patients were used as pawns in the effort. Because malaria can't be grown in cultures, live subjects were needed: strains were extracted from troops who had been exposed to malaria while abroad and then injected into thousands of mental patients and prisoners. But many troops also became unknowing test subjects, with devastating results: \" some of the guys were ruined, sent home because they had so many malaria relapses, \" says masterson. \" their bodies were wrecked. \" as time reports, doctors set out to test the top 100 potential drugs out of 14,000 compounds that had been made. Some troops were dosed with \" mary \" ( sulfamerazine ), others with atabrine. At best, the treatments were useless; at their worst, they left troops wrecked by organ damage. Masterson estimates 10 % of infected mental patients died ( she didn't record any troop deaths ). What ultimately worked was what masterson calls a \" magic formula \" stolen from the nazis: chloroquine \" went on to save more lives than any other drug in history, \" she tells nbc news, though malaria-causing parasites eventually developed resistance to it. While the existence of the project was previously known, the book's fresh details will \" renew debate over the ethics of using unsuspecting people as test subjects, \" observes nbc.

Troops then injecting those strains into people with syphilis and schizophrenia, reports author karen masterson, who researched files at the national archives. Some details of the project have been previously reported, but the book's new revelations renew debate over the ethics of using unsuspecting people as test subjects — similar to the tuskegee syphilis study on low-income black men. Thousands of mental patients at eight hospitals became \"pod people, \" made and kept ill so scientists could use their blood in clinical drug trials. Eventually, pockets of troops, many in the south pacific, unwittingly became guinea pigs for potential anti-malaria drugs. But certain treatments were worthless or harmful, leaving numerous service members with lasting organ damage, said masterson, whose book also is titled \"the malaria project. \" patients with malaria at an outpost in the panama canal zone in 1943.

            "Karen m. Masterson is the author of the forthcoming book, the malaria project: the u.s. Government's secret mission to find a miracle cure, out next week. Our highest ranked public health officials have answered questions about ebola. Most come from reporters centering on who dropped the ball, and why no treatment exists. Thomas frieden, director of the centers for disease control and prevention, has tried to give the real answer: don't blame a lack of drugs, or bad practices at the world health organization; blame the absolute lack of good public health for people in poor countries. Famous experts, ranging from paul farmer to jeffery sachs, have tried to use reason to show why investments in clinics go further to stop diseases like ebola than do investments in vaccines and drugs. Their arguments are simple: build clinics and train medical staff to care for people, and they will be competent to tackle whatever problems emerge. ( the teach-a-man-to-fish argument. ) if such a clinic existed in the rural village in guinea where the current outbreak's original case of ebola broke, its staff could have advised the community on how to contain the infection. That didn't happen, and now the cdc is predicting a million infections by january. The u.s. Commits roughly $ 9 billion annually to global health programs",
            "Tens of thousands of mental patients and troops unknowingly became malaria test subjects during the 1940s — part of a secret federal rush to cure a dread disease and win a world war, according to a book published tuesday that exposes vast, previously unknown breaches of medical ethics. \"the malaria project \" — operating via the same covert white house machinery that drove the manhattan project — tasked doctors with removing malaria from naturally exposed u.s. Troops then injecting those strains into people with syphilis and schizophrenia, reports author karen masterson, who researched files at the national archives. Some details of the project have been previously reported, but the book's new revelations renew debate over the ethics of using unsuspecting people as test subjects — similar to the tuskegee syphilis study on low-income black men. Thousands of mental patients at eight hospitals became \"pod people, \" made and kept ill so scientists could use their blood in clinical drug trials. Eventually, pockets of troops, many in the south pacific, unwittingly became guinea pigs for potential anti-malaria drugs. But certain treatments were worthless or harmful, leaving numerous service members with lasting organ damage, said masterson, whose book also is titled \"the malaria project. \" patients with malaria at an outpost in the panama canal zone in 1943.

            "Image copyright afp image caption chinese and vietnamese coast guard ships are patrolling near the haiyang shiyou oil rig, seen to the rear a vietnamese fishing boat has sunk after it collided with a chinese vessel near a controversial oil rig in the south china sea, amid tensions between the two nations. Both countries are blaming the other for the incident. Vietnam's coast guard said the boat was encircled by 40 chinese vessels before it was rammed, reports said. But chinese state media outlet xinhua said vietnam's boat collided with its vessel after \" engaging in harassment \". The bbc's martin patience says that whatever the truth, the sinking is likely to further escalate tensions between the two countries, given that for the past few weeks they have engaged in skirmishes at sea. The two are locked in an intensifying dispute over south china sea territory. Vietnam has protested against china moving its haiyang shiyou 981 rig to waters also claimed by hanoi, at a spot near the disputed paracel islands. Monday's incident happened just 17 nautical miles from the rig, vietnamese reports said. Xinhua on tuesday claimed that vietnam had \" on many occasions dispatched various boats with the sole intention of harassing chinese-linked companies drilling in that part of the ocean \". It said china had made serious representations to vietnam to request that",

A comprehensive survey of executive pay has found that the average ceo-to-median-worker pay ratio in the us has reached 339 to 1, reports the guardian. Simply put, median workers at most of the companies surveyed would need to work 45 years to earn what the ceo makes in one year. This figure is higher than that of other industrialized countries, where ceos make less, according to a bloomberg analysis. Published by minnesota rep. Keith ellison, the study looked at the earnings of nearly 14 million workers at 225 companies with total annual revenues of $ 6.3 trillion. Among the findings: in 188 of the 225 companies surveyed, the pay of the ceo could be used to pay more than 100 workers. The gaps are most apparent in the fast food and retail industries, which had a 977 to 1 ratio. The findings are consistent with another recent report by the compensation research firm equilar. Equilar evaluated pay at the 100 largest public companies by revenue and found that in 2017 the median ceo pay package was about $ 15.7 million, its highest figure since equilar first started analyzing pay in 2007, the washington post reported at the time. The biggest earner was broadcom's hock tan, who brought in a breathtaking $ 103.2 million. The pay disparity rankles sarah anderson, policy director at inequality.org, who says it could be historic. \"we've known for many years we have an extreme gap between ceo and worker pay, \" she tells the guardian, \" but this report goes into detail about which companies are doing the most to contribute to inequality by having extreme gaps in pay scales. \"",

        "summary": "On the heels of major defeat comes surprising victory: shortly after a federal judge denied a request from the standing rock sioux to halt construction on the dakota access pipeline, the federal government stepped in and did exactly that. Abc news reports the department of justice, department of the interior, and army jointly announced a temporary injunction against construction of the oil pipeline under lake oahe in north dakota. It's also asking the company behind the pipeline to voluntarily stop construction on either side of the lake, according to the wall street journal. The tribe relies on the lake — directly upstream from its reservation — for drinking water, religious practices, fishing, and more. It claimed construction would damage sacred sites and possible leaks would ruin its potable water. The army corps of engineers will now \" reconsider \" whether the pipeline breaks federal law, including the national environmental policy act, the atlantic reports. In its announcement, the government acknowledged the thousands of people that joined in protest of the pipeline. The tribe calls the decision a \" game changer. \" in addition, the government says tribes will be invited to take place in consultations about potential reforms to the way infrastructure projects around the country are approved. \"native peoples have suffered generations of broken promises and today the federal government said that national reform is needed, \" the chairman of the standing rock sioux tells the journal, calling the government's decision \" historic. \"",

One 430-mile section in the northern portion of the 1,400-mile-long reef lost 67 % of its shallow-water coral. All told, the great barrier reef lost 22 % of its coral in 2016's bleaching event. \" to see those sections, two-thirds of the northern section, dead, is catastrophic, \" an australian environmental minister tells the new york times. The northern section of the reef had historically been the least damaged by human activity. The coral bleaching was caused by warming waters; the southern portion of the reef escaped great harm thanks to a cyclone that lowered water temperatures. This was the third — and by far the worst — coral bleaching event to hit the great barrier reef in the past 18 years, the ap reports. Since the last event in 2002, the reef's coral had increased by 19 %, according to the australian government. Experts say it could take 10 to 15 years to regain the coral lost in this year's bleaching event — but that's assuming there isn't a fourth during that span. One expert says that even if the great barrier reef hits pre-bleaching levels of coral, it will never regain the diversity it once had. The un is considering adding the great barrier reef to its list of world heritage sites that are in danger. And the australian government plans to spent $ 1.5 billion on protecting the reef over the next decade. ( a huge reef was discovered hiding behind the great barrier reef. )",

A rep for the kenya wildlife service tells deutsche welle that it clawed the man — who suffered a broken bone and deep cuts to his shoulder, per the ap — because people were \" hooting their horns, taking selfies and all that, and the lion got agitated. \" the lion was later escorted back to the reserve.",
