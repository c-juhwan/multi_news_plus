        "summary": "In an unraveling ceasefire with russia-backed separatists, ukraine lost the city of debaltseve yesterday; the bbc also reports that shelling picked up in the rebel-held city of donetsk, and that separatists have been conducting mortar attacks in the town of shirokyne. So it's perhaps not surprising that ukrainian president petro poroshenko asked yesterday for the un to step in and send peacekeepers to the eastern part of the country, as per the washington post. But russia isn't having any of that, telling its adversary to keep un peacekeepers out or risk violating the minsk deal reached last week, the bbc reports. Poroshenko's call for help \" raises suspicions that he wants to destroy the minsk accords, \" says vitaly churkin, the russian ambassador, per the bbc. \" if one proposes new schemes right away, the question arises whether [ the accords ] will be respected. \" poroshenko today called vladimir putin, german chancellor angela merken, and french president francois hollande — the parties who drafted the ceasefire — and implored them not to act like \" what happened in debaltseve \" met ceasefire mandates, the post reports. The russian foreign minister says the taking of the city does adhere to the rules, because debaltseve was held by rebels before the deal, the bbc notes. One analyst for the bbc isn't even sure a peacekeeping mission would work, saying that \" nobody is going to send troops into an active war zone, \" and that russia and ukraine will both dig their heels in to take ( or take back ) what they think is theirs. Still, the white house seems to know where it stands: \" it is … crystal clear that russia-backed separatists and russia themselves have not lived up to their commitments that they made, \" press secretary josh earnest said yesterday, per voice of america. Hollande's office issued a statement saying a \" new push \" was under way to enforce the ceasefire, the post notes.",

Scientists at princeton and nyu are explaining why: when it comes to beer, we have the bubbles to thank, the smithsonian reports. Using high-speed cameras, the researchers recorded motion on the surface of several drinks: coffee, amber beer, and guinness. Foam reduced sloshing, and the experts say it's because the foam absorbs the energy of the moving liquid. More foam meant less sloshing. That means that if you're looking for an easy-to-carry beer, guinness may be your best bet. Why, you ask, are scientists spending their time on this? well, it's not just to have a better night out. The study, an abstract says, \" has promising applications in numerous industrial applications such as the transport of liquid in cargoes. \" and believe it or not, this isn't the first time the physics of coffee spillage has received study, physics central reports: a couple of years ago, \" blurry-eyed physicists \" tried to figure out how to walk with a full cup of coffee without spilling any, as the american physical society noted.

            "Synopsis: science of slosh an image analysis program reveals the biomechanics of walking with coffee. H. C. Mayer and r. Krechetnikov, phys. Rev. E ( 2012 ) each morning, blurry-eyed physicists try to solve a frustratingly complex mechanical problem: how to walk with a full cup of coffee, without letting it slosh over the sides. Writing in physical review e, hans mayer and rouslan krechetnikov at the university of california, santa barbara, report their study of the biomechanics of walking with coffee and the factors that lead to spills. The sloshing of liquid in a cylindrical container, like a mug, is similar to the motion of a pendulum: the natural frequencies of oscillation depend on the liquid's height and diameter ( and, of course, gravity ). In a typical mug, 7 cm in diameter and 10 cm tall, the lowest frequency oscillation of the coffee rocking back and forth in the cup is easily excited by walking at a normal pace. This gives an intuitive explanation of why coffee spills, but mayer and krechetnikov have found that noise — potentially caused by uneven steps or small jerks of the cup — plays an important role in amplifying the natural oscillations of coffee into a full-blown spill.

            "Synopsis: science of slosh an image analysis program reveals the biomechanics of walking with coffee. H. C. Mayer and r. Krechetnikov, phys. Rev. E ( 2012 ) each morning, blurry-eyed physicists try to solve a frustratingly complex mechanical problem: how to walk with a full cup of coffee, without letting it slosh over the sides. Writing in physical review e, hans mayer and rouslan krechetnikov at the university of california, santa barbara, report their study of the biomechanics of walking with coffee and the factors that lead to spills. The sloshing of liquid in a cylindrical container, like a mug, is similar to the motion of a pendulum: the natural frequencies of oscillation depend on the liquid's height and diameter ( and, of course, gravity ). In a typical mug, 7 cm in diameter and 10 cm tall, the lowest frequency oscillation of the coffee rocking back and forth in the cup is easily excited by walking at a normal pace. This gives an intuitive explanation of why coffee spills, but mayer and krechetnikov have found that noise — potentially caused by uneven steps or small jerks of the cup — plays an important role in amplifying the natural oscillations of coffee into a full-blown spill. They set up an image analysis program to track coffee levels in cups carried by human subjects,",

Police detained a 45-year-old yazoo city man after two more motorists reported being pulled over last night. Both drivers got suspicious and drove off before the man got to their vehicle. One noted an upside down state flag on the suspect's vanity plate, and police later spotted the vehicle and took james lucas into custody. He has not been charged. One bizarre twist: one of the witnesses said the suspect got out of his car with a gun in his hand, which prompted the witness to drive off. The other man pursued him, however, and the witness then pulled out his own gun and fired at the pursuing car. He apparently didn't hit the driver, but he did manage to escape and give police the information about the license plate. Police found fake badges and handcuffs where the man was staying, notes wlbt.",

        "summary": "The sex of baby mice — and quite likely baby humans — is determined by a virus that inserted itself into the mammalian genome 1.5 million years ago, live science reports. Yale researchers published their surprising findings on march 30 in nature. According to a press release, more than 40 % of the human genome is comprised of remnants from viruses that invaded it millions of years ago. Researchers found some of that viral material on mice x chromosomes — the chromosomes that determine the sex of embryos. As long as that viral remnant is active, males and females are born at equal rates. But if the viral remnant is turned off, which upi reports happens in some embryos, males are born at twice the rate of females. While it's unclear if the same process holds for humans, the human x chromosome contains the same viral material as its mouse counterpart. What's more, researchers believe the method by which mice embryos turn off the viral remnant could be used to keep cancer from spreading. That's because the same viral material is also found in tumors and could be helping them grow. But really they're still trying to figure this whole thing out. \" why mammalian sex ratios are determined by a remnant of ancient virus is a fascinating question, \" says esearcher andrew xiao.

Viral dna can become part of an animal's genome when a kind of virus called a retrovirus infects a cell, and slips its genes into the dna of host cells.

The estimate of 2,000 gallons of leakage is a \" worst-case scenario \" and the true figure is probably less, he says.

The guitar was used by love's late husband at nirvana's 1993 mtv unplugged in new york performance and is the last one he ever played, per slate. Silva contends that love's daughter, frances bean cobain, gave him the guitar shortly before they married; they divorced in 2016. Silva alleges that love, former britney spears manager sam lufti, actor ross butler, and chauffeur yan yukhtman tried to kill silva and make it look like a suicide, which would have conveniently freed up the guitar and other shared assets. Silva claims that on june 3, the four broke into silva's home and forced him into a car by threatening him with rape and other physical harm. A friend of silva's who was in the house at the time called the police, who intercepted the car. Lufti told police the call had been a prank, and silva did not speak up because he feared for the safety of his 7-year-old daughter, whom lufti had allegedly threatened to kill if silva said anything. The alleged attackers then drove silva back to his house and tried for several hours to get him to sign away his rights to the guitar, other assets, and spousal support. Silva filed a police report five days later. A civil complaint filed in los angeles county accuses love, lutfi, and butler of criminal conspiracy to commit trespass, burglary, home invasion, robbery, assault, battery, kidnapping, and murder. \" frances and the family are prepared to fight with a fury of unprecedented legal force, and they will prevail, \" says someone close to love's family. ( love has also been in some hot water recently over her taxes. )",

        "summary": "In the wake of the boston marathon bombing, twitter was flooded with breaking news — some of which turned out to be erroneous — as well as some journalists using that news to score political points. Journalism has been called \" the first rough draft of history, \" and twitter has become \" the first rough draft of journalism, \" writes jeremy stahl on slate. As such, the media must abide by some basic rules while using it: turn off auto-posting: slate did not, and its twitter feed ( which stahl oversees ) ended up tweeting a dear prudence column about threesomes. Use official or first-person sources, and cite them: ignore people reporting things they heard on police scanners, \" a notoriously unreliable source \" of confirmed information. Don't tweet speculation: both slate and buzzfeed tweeted a new york post report that 12 were dead, which turned out to be false. But realize even the best outlets get things wrong: the ap erroneously reported that boston authorities purposely shut down cell service yesterday; reuters erroneously reported the jfk library fire was an explosion ( and slate retweeted it ). Don't snark: no one wants to read \" jokes about how republicans are going to blame obama for this \" right now. Don't try to score political points: similarly, no one wants to read things like what nicholas kristof tweeted and quickly removed: \" explosion is a reminder that atf needs a director. Shame on senate republicans for blocking apptment. \" in fact, don't get political at all: in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy like this, reporters should report — not \" offer political analysis before there's any actual information available. \" don't feed the trolls: retweeting \" outrageous conspiracy theories \" is tempting, but just ignore them. But if you find someone else making one of the above mistakes, don't shame them and don't get self-righteous, stahl writes. \" let he who is without sin cast the first critical tweet. You might find yourself fact-shaming the new york post one minute, only to pass on an inaccurate report from reuters the next. \" click for his full column.",

Rahm emanuel said wednesday that he would not resign, despite growing criticism for what some are calling his botched response to video footage showing a chicago police officer last year firing 16 times at laquan mcdonald, who was walking away from officers. \" no, \" he said, during one of several testy exchanges through the course of a nearly hour-long discussion with politico's mike allen and politico illinois ' natasha korecki. \" because i really so much looked forward to this interview and i wanted to have it.

            "Mayor rahm emanuel on wednesday cancelled his trip to a climate change conference in paris — and postponed a political fundraiser scheduled for next week — to devote his full attention to the political climate change in chicago caused by the continuing furor over the laquan mcdonald shooting video. After firing police superintendent garry mccarthy on tuesday, emanuel said the trip was up in the air. He had not yet decided whether to forge ahead with plans to join president barack obama, his former boss, and other world leaders in paris at a global conference on climate change. The remark sounded almost tone-deaf, considering the heat emanuel has taken for waiting until one week after the april 7 mayoral runoff to ask the city council to authorize a $ 5 million settlement to the mcdonald family even before a lawsuit had been filed. The mayor has been further criticized for keeping the incendiary video under wraps until last week and releasing it, only after a judge ordered him to do so. Overnight, the mayor who promised to listen more and talk less in a second term apparently thought better of it. He cancelled the trip to paris to do what parochial chicagoans want their mayor to do in all circumstances, no less during a crisis: stay home and devote his full attention to solving chicago's problems. \"i've worked on the issue"

            "Not even in nursing — a field women dominate 10 to 1 — are employees exempt from a gender-based pay gap that gives male workers better wages, sending male nurses home with anywhere from $ 3,800 to $ 17,000 more than women make every single year. The amount varies among specialties, but male nurses make an average of about $ 5,000 more annually than women, according to a study published in the journal of american medicine association on tuesday. Nurse anesthetists have the widest gap and general hospital nurses the lowest, with orthopedics the only specialty that did not report inequity. The report highlights longstanding concerns of inequality that have flummoxed nurses and supervisors alike — if a field hires women the vast majority of the time and women frequently advance to leadership roles, how is the pay gap still so wide? \"i can't understand it, \" tish kilfoyle, director of home care nursing at hospice of the western reserve in cleveland, told takepart. \"it's just wrong. \" as someone who hires"

Officials feared it would, as gases swelled the creature's 81-foot-long body, but the whale has since deflated a bit, the town clerk tells the bbc. Now the town just needs to get rid of the 60-ton carcass — there had been, as one official noted earlier this week, some concern \" about the smell from this \" as warmer temperatures arrived. Fortunately, ctv reports, the royal ontario museum has agreed to help, and will send a 10-person team next week to cut away the skin, blubber, and muscles, which will be dumped, and then take apart the skeleton, which will be transported to ontario on an 18-wheeler. What does the museum get out of the two-week operation, which will cost tens of thousands of dollars? quite a bit, says one official: the endangered blue whale is the world's largest animal, and though no one is cheering the death, \" this is an incredible opportunity to see one and to work with one, \" he says, though \" it's a lot of very smelly work. \" the museum will also handle another blue whale carcass that washed up elsewhere in newfoundland; both whales, along with seven others, are believed to have been crushed in thick sea ice last month. ( that's 5 % of the estimated population in the northwest atlantic, cbc notes. ) tissue samples and skeletons will be studied, and one of the skeletons may eventually be displayed — though scientists won't get all the parts; the western star reported earlier this week that someone illegally sawed off one of the whale's flippers.

            "Lockheed martin is developing a hypersonic spy plane, called the sr-72, that will be able to fly at mach 6, or six times the speed of sound. A new hypersonic spy plane, capable of flying up to six times faster than the speed of sound, is being developed by aerospace giant lockheed martin corp., according to company officials. The new aircraft, known as the sr-72, is the unmanned successor to lockheed's sr-71 blackbird, a twin-engine, two-seater, supersonic aircraft that was developed in the 1960s. The company's new spy plane will be able to fly twice as fast as the blackbird and three times faster than current fighter jets, accelerating to mach 6, which is six times the speed of sound, or more than 3,500 mph ( 5,600 km/h ).

To do this he had to endure a grueling regimen of nearly 50 miles in 15 hours every day, so it's not surprising that he ran through 20 pairs of shoes and, unlike the vegan diet kept by jurek, indulged in bacon, steak, fried chicken, burgers, ice cream, pb&js, candy, and at the end of each day, beer, reports running. \" it's been a long journey, \" he said, quite literally. The appalachian trail winds its way 2,190 miles through often rough terrain from maine to georgia — which, as the crow flies, is about the distance from los angeles to washington, dc — providing runners with almost 465,000 feet of elevation change ( that's like summiting mt. Everest 16 times, minus the thin air ). Of the thousands who attempt the thru-hike each year, one in four makes it and most take six months. Meltzer, who the new york times reports used to be a ski-resort bartender, endured less than seven hours of sleep a night and, in his final push, covered 83 miles nonstop between saturday morning and 3: 38am sunday.

Examples: men are five times as likely to develop cancer from hpv as women, twice as likely to develop hodgkin's lymphoma from the epstein-barr virus, and 1.5 times as likely to die of tuberculosis, per new scientist. Scientists puzzling over why have suggested that women could have stronger immune systems, which would make sense from an evolutionary perspective given the importance of being able to bring offspring to term and nurse them through infancy. But now researchers using mathematical modeling say it might be the viruses themselves that have evolved to behave differently in their hosts depending on sex, and that includes in other animals like chickens, they report in the journal nature communications. Viruses spread between hosts by making more copies of themselves. But in doing so, they also make their hosts ill, which doesn't actually behoove them. \" that's not something a pathogen particularly sets out to do because it's shooting itself in the foot, \" says one researcher. Because a virus so easily jumps from mother to fetus or infant, women are the superior host, and thus there is evolutionary pressure to harm them less, reason reports. How a virus can determine the sex of its host is a mystery, though subtle differences in hormones and other pathways could play a role. If researchers can sort this out, they might be able to trick viruses into thinking they're always infecting women, and get them to go easy on the men, too.

Latest news: research on male animals prevents women from getting best drugs many think this pattern is because of differences between the sexes ' immune systems. But another explanation is that women are more valuable hosts. Women can pass infections to their children during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding, so there's an evolutionary pressure on viruses to be less harmful to them, say francisco úbeda and vincent",
            "Model formulation we extend the classical sir model23 incorporating vertical and horizontal transmission between male and female hosts ( see fig. 1 and methods for details ). We solve this model allowing pathogens to exhibit different virulence in men and women. Figure 1: diagram showing our epidemiological model of vertical and horizontal transmission in males and females. We model the continuous change in time of the fraction of susceptible ( subscript s ), infected ( subscript i ) and recovered ( subscript r ) individuals in males ( m ) and females ( f ). Males and females born, b m and b f, are infected with probability αf i. Susceptible males and females, m s and f s, become infected with probability given by the force of infection in males h m =β( δ m ) γ mm m i +β( δ f ) γ fm f i and females h f =β("

In a message to supporters yesterday, campaign manager jim messina said obama is now embracing the efforts of priorities usa action, a pro-democrat super pac formed by two former white house aides, because it's time to \" face the reality of the law as it stands \" — or hand republicans a huge financial advantage. Two major republican super pacs raised $ 51 million last year between them, while groups supporting individual gop presidential candidates raised around $ 40 million. Meanwhile, priorities usa action and other big democratic groups raised just $ 19 million, the new york times reports. A spokesperson for one republican super pac called obama's shift a \" brazenly cynical move, \" considering the president once called \" outside groups a threat to democracy \" — and it certainly is a political risk, the washington post notes. As part of the decision, obama himself will not attend priorities usa action events, but senior campaign staffers, white house advisers, and cabinet officials will.

Ken ham, president of answers in genesis, tells the ap he hopes it will prove that the bible is true. The ark is filled with testaments to answers in genesis ' beliefs: the earth was created in six days and is only 6,000 years old, dinosaurs coexisted with humans, and noah fit the ancestors of modern animals onboard. That last item has led to the replica's animal pens being filled with bizarre creatures, such as a house cat with a lion's head and some sort of hornless rhino. \"in a world that we see becoming very secularized before our eyes, it's really time for christians to do something of this size, \" ham tells the courier-journal. Meanwhile, the paper states many people see the ark as an \" embarrassing, entertainment-cloaked attack on science that uses tax incentives in violation of the separation of church and state. \" a judge ruled ark encounter could get $ 18 million in tax incentives despite having a \" strict religious test \" for employees, who must be christians and pledge to oppose same-sex marriage and pre-marital sex. The project was announced in 2010 but had trouble raising funds. Strangely, bill nye may have saved the ark by inadvertently drawing attention to it when he agreed to debate ham about evolution.

The second case was in april after the patient was shot and needed multiple transfusions. \"the capacity of zika to spread through blood transfusions needs to be evaluated, as well as the blood protection measures that should be adopted based on the new findings, \" brazil's health ministry says. A brazilian infectious disease specialist tells the journal \" there is no reason for panic. \" a number of countries are issuing stricter rules for blood donations in the face of the zika outbreak. The health ministry is reiterating that blood banks shouldn't accept any donations from people who've had zika until 30 days after they've fully recovered. And the american red cross says people who've been to central or south america, mexico, or the caribbean should wait 28 days before donating blood. Still, the red cross states the risk for americans receiving blood transfusions is \" extremely low. \" zika first appeared in brazil last year. Since then, it's infected an estimated 500,000 to 1.5 million brazilians and popped up in 30 countries.

            "Brasilia ( reuters ) - brazilian health officials said on thursday they have confirmed two cases of transmission of zika through transfusions of blood from donors who had been infected with the mosquito-borne virus that is spreading rapidly through the americas. A technician of oswaldo cruz foundation ( fiocruz ) inspects an aedes aegypti mosquito in recife, brazil, january 27, 2016. Reuters/ueslei marcelino marcelo addas carvalho, director of the blood center at the sao paulo state university of campinas, said genetic testing confirmed that a man who received a blood transfusion using blood from a donor with zika in march 2015 became infected with the virus, although the patient did not develop symptoms. Earlier, the health department of campinas, an industrial city near sao paulo, said a man with gunshot wounds became infected with zika after multiple blood transfusions in april 2015 that included blood donated by an infected person. Carvalho said the infection of the wounded man was most probably caused by the transfusion but genetic tests have not yet been conducted to confirm it.

            "Brasilia ( reuters ) - brazilian health officials said on thursday they have confirmed two cases of transmission of zika through transfusions of blood from donors who had been infected with the mosquito-borne virus that is spreading rapidly through the americas. A technician of oswaldo cruz foundation ( fiocruz ) inspects an aedes aegypti mosquito in recife, brazil, january 27, 2016. Reuters/ueslei marcelino marcelo addas carvalho, director of the blood center at the sao paulo state university of campinas, said genetic testing confirmed that a man who received a blood transfusion using blood from a donor with zika in march 2015 became infected with the virus, although the patient did not develop symptoms. Earlier, the health department of campinas, an industrial city near sao paulo, said a man with gunshot wounds became infected with zika after multiple blood transfusions in april 2015 that included blood donated by an infected person. Carvalho said the infection of the wounded man was most probably caused by the transfusion but genetic tests have not yet been conducted to confirm it. He said it was very unlikely the infection was caused by a mosquito bite because the patient was in a hospital intensive care unit for three months. The patient later died from his gunshot wounds and not the zika infection, local health officials and carvalho said. \"the two cases can be considered transmission of the virus through blood transfusion, with greater certainty in the first because we did genetic sequencing comparing the virus in the donor and to the virus in the recipient, \" he said by telephone.

        "summary": "The family of a young chicago woman who was found dead inside a hotel freezer is questioning the police account of how she got there. Kenneka jenkins, 19, was found dead on sunday, one day after she had wandered away from a party in a room at the crowne plaza hotel, the chicago tribune reports. Police told jenkins ' mother, tereasa martin, her daughter walked into the freezer while drunk, but a \" horrified \" martin says she's not buying it. Martin says she doubted her daughter, if impaired, could have opened the freezer's double steel doors. \" she didn't just pop them open, \" martin says. Jenkin's sister adds, per abc7, that the police theory doesn't \" add up. \" jenkins ' family rushed to the hotel near o ' hare airport at 5am saturday, after martin got a call from her daughter's friends saying she had gone missing. The family's last contact with jenkins was a text message she sent her sister at 1: 30am, per the tribune. Hotel staff rebuffed the family's initial pleas to review security camera footage, saying they needed a missing persons report from police. It took martin several hours to get one after police told her to wait in case jenkins came home. A search of the hotel didn't begin until after 1pm on saturday. An initial review of surveillance video didn't turn up images of jenkins, but martin says a second look after the family complained turned up pictures of her daughter \" staggering \" near the front desk. Jenkins was finally found in a walk-in freezer at 12: 48am on sunday, in an area of the hotel undergoing renovation. \" it's something that no one could ever imagine, \" says martin. \" it's unbelievable. \"",

        "summary": "Two leading heart groups have announced changes being described as \" tectonic \" and \" profound \" in the way doctors prescribe cholesterol-lowering statins. The shift from the american heart association and the american college of cardiology means that doctors will no longer focus on a patent's level of \" bad cholesterol \" — or ldl — and automatically prescribe statins when it reaches a certain level. Instead, they will focus on a range of overall health factors. \" this is an enormous shift in policy as it relates to who should be treated for high levels of cholesterol, \" the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the cleveland clinic tells cnn. \" for many years, the goal was to get the ' bad ' cholesterol levels — or ldl levels — below 100, \" says dr. Steven nissen. \" those targets have been completely eliminated in the new guidelines, and the threshold for treatment has been eliminated. \" so who will be taking statins? people who have a history of heart trouble or diabetes, and — in the one exception to the notion of ignoring ldl levels — those who have dangerously high levels of 190 or more, reports the new york times. Beyond that, the guidelines say anyone who has a 7.5 % risk of developing heart disease, based on a new formula ( the site is slow, apparently bogged down ) also should take them, reports usa today. In yet another major shift, the guidelines now apply to people at risk of stroke as well as a heart attack, reports ap.

        "summary": "\" how snakes lost their legs has long been a mystery to scientists, \" dr. Hongyu yi says in a press release from the university of edinburgh. But that mystery may have finally been solved thanks to a 90 million-year-old skull and advanced ct scan technology. It's been long theorized that the ancestors of modern snakes lost their limbs when they evolved to live in the sea. Researchers at the university of edinburgh determined that's not quite right when they used a ct scan to create a detailed 3d model of the skull of a dinilysia patagonica — a close relative of modern snakes — and compared it to those of modern reptiles. What they found was a unique structure in the inner ear that controls balance and hearing and is shared only by burrowing animals. Modern snakes that live in water don't have it. Using that information, researchers determined the ancestors of modern snakes actually lost their limbs in order to hunt and live in burrows, per the press release. \" the inner ears of fossils can reveal a remarkable amount of information, and are very useful when the exterior of fossils are too damaged or fragile to examine, \" yi says. The study also confirmed the 6.5-foot-long dinilysia patagonica as the largest burrowing snake ever. The results were published friday in science advances. The study confirms a yale study from earlier this year that found snakes evolved on land and not in water, upi reports. That study used genomes, fossils, and more to determine the ancestors of modern snakes lost their front legs approximately 128 million years ago, though they still had tiny hind legs. ( here's how boa constrictors really kill their prey. )",

Comparisons between ct scans of the fossil and modern reptiles indicate that snakes lost their legs when their ancestors evolved to live and hunt in burrows, which many snakes still do today. The findings show snakes did not lose their limbs in order to live in the sea, as was previously suggested. Scientists used ct scans to examine the bony inner ear of dinilysia patagonica, a 2-metre long reptile closely linked to modern snakes. These bony canals and cavities, like those in the ears of modern burrowing snakes, controlled its hearing and balance. They built 3d virtual models to compare the inner ears of the fossils with those of modern lizards and snakes. Researchers found a distinctive structure within the inner ear",
            "Edinburgh, scotland, nov. 28 ( upi ) -- comparisons between modern snake skulls and the 90 million-year-old fossil suggest snakes lost their limbs in order to burrow on land. Using ct scans to study the inner ear cavity of the fossilized dinilysia patagonica skull, scientists at the university of edinburgh found the structure of the canal is similar to modern burrowing serpents, but not those that live above ground or in water. The findings suggest the dinilysia patagonica, at two meters long, is the largest burrowing snake ever known. \" how snakes lost their legs has long been a mystery to scientists, but it seems that this happened when their ancestors became adept at burrowing, \" lead researcher dr. Honguy yi of the university of edinburgh's school of geosciences said in a press release. \" the inner ears of fossils can reveal a remarkable amount of information, and are very useful",

We used x-ray virtual models of the inner ear to predict the habit of dinilysia patagonica, a stem snake closely related to the origin of modern snakes. Previous work has shown that modern snakes perceive substrate vibrations via their inner ear. Our data show that d. Patagonica and modern burrowing squamates share a unique spherical vestibule in the inner ear, as compared with swimmers and habitat generalists. We built predictive models for snake habit based on their vestibular shape, which estimated d. Patagonica and the hypothetical ancestor of crown snakes as burrowers with high probabilities. This study provides an extensive comparative data set to test fossoriality quantitatively in stem snakes, and it shows that burrowing was predominant in the lineages leading to modern crown snakes.

Ahead of this week's cleanup, authorities had to drain a major portion of the canal and evacuate what turned out to be tons of fish, reports the local, which notes that parisians have been amassing on bridges to see what kind of mud-covered treasures the canal yields. The last cleanup, in 2001, yielded unexploded shells from wwi, gold coins, and safes amid around 40 tons of trash, the guardian reports. The current cleanup is still underway, but authorities have already found tons more trash, including signs, suitcases, carpets, and, for some reason, a huge number of chairs. Residents say there seems to be more trash than ever this time around, and they blame the increase on the hip young newcomers they have nicknamed \" bobos. \" \" that's paris for you, it's filthy, \" a 54-year-old man who was there for the last cleaning tells the guardian. \" the last time, i don't remember seeing so much rubbish in it.

Patrick frazee, her fiancé and kaylee's father, met her there to pick up the 1-year-old. Berreth hasn't been seen since, but on nov. 25 her cellphone pinged almost 700 miles away, near gooding, idaho.

It's not clear whether it was actually berreth who sent the texts, fox news reports, but she hasn't been heard from since. Authorities who searched berreth's apartment found both her cars still there along with all of her belongings except her purse; there were cinnamon rolls on the counter that had apparently remained untouched since thanksgiving.

Diplomatic personnel out of yemen on tuesday and washington told nationals to leave the country immediately after warnings of potential attacks that pushed the united states to shut missions across the middle east. Yemen, one of the poorest arab countries, is the base for al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ), one of the most active branches of the network founded by osama bin laden, and militants have launched attacks from there against the west.

Supporters of the nsa's surveillance tactics have used the latest threat to justify their opposition to reining in the agency's domestic spying activities. But the information related to the latest threat was collected overseas under the foreign intelligence surveillance act – not the bulk surveillance programs disclosed by the guardian and the washington post thanks to whistleblower edward snowden.

A doctor suggests he might have died suddenly of a heart attack. Documentation and recovered photos helped authorities identify bajorat, a german adventurer who began sailing the world with his wife, claudia, 20 years ago, the independent reports. Photos of them picnicking and visiting the arc de triomphe in paris indicate a carefree life, but they split in 2008 and claudia died of cancer two years later. \" thirty years we've been together on the same path, \" wrote bajorat in an online tribute. \" then the power of the demons was stronger than the will to live. \" bajorat continued sailing between the pacific and europe, and his final position indicates he might have been seeking help by radio. \" he was a very experienced sailor, \" says a fellow seaman. \" i don't believe he would have sailed into a storm.

Terrill ) ( associated press ) cleveland ( ap ) — the mother of a state department employee killed in the deadly attacks in benghazi, libya, angrily lashed out at hillary clinton on monday at the republican national convention, accusing clinton of lying to her about her son's death. Two marine corps veterans who fought in benghazi as part of a security team posted near the u.s. Diplomatic compound also blamed clinton for lax security before the attacks on sept. 11, 2012, that killed four americans, including the u.s. Ambassador. The accusations came during the opening night of the convention, as republicans cast donald trump as a strong leader who can keep americans safe in a dangerous world.

Pat smith, the mother of state department employee sean smith, accused clinton of lying to her by blaming the assault on an anti-muslim video, instead of labeling it a calculated terrorist attack. Clinton was secretary of state when the attacks occurred and now is the presumptive democratic presidential nominee. \" i blame hillary clinton personally for the death of my son, \" smith said in an emotional speech applauded by delegates. Smith noted that clinton had told her daughter, chelsea, in an email that the attacks were likely terrorism, but told smith and other family members a different story.

        "summary": "This week's flurry of court rulings made it a little tricky to keep track of which states allow gay marriage. The upshot is that the supreme court's moves added seven more states to the yes column: idaho, indiana, nevada, oklahoma, utah, virginia, and wisconsin, bringing the total number of states that allow same-sex marriage to 26, reports the new york times. ( that doesn't include dc, which also allows them. ) but things gets a little complicated because more states were affected by the rulings, those that happened to be in the same federal circuits as other states that appealed. The times'take: \" the legal ripple effects from the various appeals court rulings the supreme court tacitly sustained should soon raise that number to 35. \" reuters, too, goes with that number, reporting that legal weddings for gay couples could soon be \" extended to 35 states. \" ap, meanwhile, settles for an answer of \" about 30, give or take. \" it will take a little time for those \" legal ripple effects \" to play out. In north carolina, for instance, a federal district judge struck down the state's ban on gay marriage yesterday, and couples immediately started getting married, reports ap in a separate story. North carolina is in the same district covered by virginia, and when the supreme court decided this week that it wouldn't hear an appeal of a ruling that struck down virginia's ban as unconstitutional, that paved the way for yesterday's ruling in raleigh. \" even before this i was happy, but i think now that it's on paper and it's legal — it's a commitment between two people, \" says a male sheriff's deputy in wake county who wed a fellow male deputy.",

        "summary": "A man who tried to stop a robbery in a wisconsin bar has been charged with a felony because he wasn't supposed to be carrying the taser he allegedly threatened the suspect with. According to wkbt-tv, jeff steele was at the king's korner bar in la crosse just before 2am last monday morning when a masked woman came in, pointed a handgun at the bartender, and demanded money. Bartender colleen hogan says she saw steele walking toward the woman with the taser. She says he didn't appear to actually use it on the suspect, but the woman was apparently startled by the sight of it and took off. The suspect, a former employee of the bar, was arrested minutes later; heidi thompson, 24, has been charged with armed robbery, the la crosse tribune reports. Steele was charged with possession of an electronic weapon because he didn't have a permit to carry the taser. \" you can have it in your home and on your private property without a concealed-carry permit, but you do need to keep a concealed-carry permit to carry it out in public, \" a police spokeswoman tells wkbt. Steele says he bought the stun gun because he lives in a rough neighborhood; he also says when he ordered it online, he was informed that it was legal in wisconsin, so he assumed it was legal to carry it around. Wkbt notes the district attorney's office will make the call as to whether to pursue the felony charge. ( read about more weird crimes from last week. )",

        "summary": "The navy's latest weapon is an electromagnetic \" railgun \" designed to fire projectiles fast and far without using gunpowder as a propellant, the washington post reports. Unveiled at a navy expo this week, the weapon uses electromagnetic impulses to shoot projectiles at up to seven times the speed of sound, creating a force so powerful that no explosive warheads are needed. The impact is like \" a freight train going through a wall at a hundred miles an hour, \" says a top navy official. It's also far cheaper than other missile engagement systems, and should reduce risk on surface ships because explosives aren't required, fox news reports. How it works: the railgun draws electricity from a ship and fires projectiles using electromagnetic energy. Under the hood, a sliding metal conductor accelerated by an electrical current runs along the weapon's two metal rails, charging up magnetic fields that fire projectiles. But the gun requires 34 mega joules of power to launch a single 23-pound projectile more than 100 miles at mach 7, and most destroyers don't have that kind of power in reserve yet, the navy times reports. What's more, engineers will need months or even years to link the railgun to the combat system on cruisers and destroyers. The navy plans to give the weapon its first sea-test next year. The navy's other cool new toy is a laser that it fired from a vessel for the first time in december.",

        "summary": "Ancient humans weren't against knocking boots with other species: we know they had sex with neanderthals. We also know they mated with the mysterious denisovans, as some australasians ( those from papua new guinea in particular ) have 5 % denisovan dna. But a \" breakthrough \" study shows the interbreeding wasn't limited to those two instances. While looking for ancient dna in the genomes of 5,600 living humans, a team at the university of washington in seattle came across evidence of a third interbreeding event, reports new scientist. A smaller contribution of denisovan dna in han chinese, chinese dai, and japanese people — about 0.2 % of their genome — suggests humans mixed with a distinct population of denisovans in not one but two locations: indonesia or australasia and east asia. Though the only four denisovan fossils that have been found come from the same cave in siberia, the research published in the journal cell shows denisovans were spread across asia and \" suggests that at least in some instances, denisovans and modern humans were willing to live in proximity and interact, \" lead author sharon browning says. Her research also backs the theory that there was a single \" wave \" of interbreeding between humans and one population of neanderthals, reports the atlantic. But browning couldn't link other ancient dna found in living humans to neanderthals or denisovans, suggesting humans may have mated with hominins we haven't even discovered yet. Harvard geneticist david reich, who was not involved in the research, says the finding of \" a definite third interbreeding event \" makes this \" a breakthrough paper, \" per the washington post.

            "Browning developed a technique that compares the genomes of many modern people, and looks for stretches of dna that are unusually varied, relative to their neighboring segments. These varied stretches are likely to have been inherited from ancient hominins like neanderthals, denisovans, or as-yet-undiscovered groups. Browning can then compare these segments to the genomes of those ancient hominins to work out exactly which group the dna came from. In the genomes of people from japan and china, browning found several segments that closely match the genome of the denisovan woman whose pinky was found in the altai mountains. But to her surprise, she also found segments that were clearly denisovan in origin, but were much weaker matches to the altai female. \"they're close enough that we're sure they're denisovan, but they're not as close, \" she says. This suggests that modern humans inherited dna from two separate groups of denisovans.

The two groups interbred, with the result that 5 percent of modern melanesian dna has a denisovan origin.

The denisovans were unknown until 2010, when researchers described a fragment of a girl's finger bone found in denisova cave in siberia. Soon afterwards, researchers sequenced its genome from the surviving dna. The dna did not belong to any known hominins, such as neanderthals, so it had to be something new.

Murdoch's tweet was sent from maple grove, minn., which the av club notes is a seven-hour drive from the dickinson, nd, walmart. Murdoch described the situation to the current radio show tuesday, explaining that when everyone woke up that morning, they realized colburn was missing. Colburn waited in the walmart for four hours, assuming someone would realize he was gone and the bus would come back for him, \" but the trouble is everybody went to bed \" after leaving the walmart, murdoch says. The drummer eventually checked into a hotel and someone who saw the band's social media plea gave him a ride to the bismarck airport; he was able to fly from there to minneapolis and make it to the show in st. Paul. \" a new sign appeared on our bus. Should be ok now, \" murdoch tweeted wednesday along with a photo of a sign meant for the bus driver's seat reading, \" someone is off the bus. \"",

In the wake of the slippers'disappearance, police learned that an emergency exit door window was broken and that the museum's alarm system was never triggered as it hadn't been set on the evening in question.

According to kcur, robert bratton bought a number of boxes of each candy at a grocery store in columbia for $ 1 each. But he says he would have been less likely to spend that money if he knew how under-filled the boxes would be. Bratton's lawsuit claims the boxes of reese's pieces were under-filled by about 29 % and the boxes of whoppers by about 41 %. His lawsuit argues shoppers are being misled. But hershey's counters that customers are \" well aware \" of the concept of \" slack fill, \" by which packages contain some empty space either due to settling or to protect their contents. Besides, the company argues, the total weight and number of candies is printed on each box. Finally, hershey's says the empty space shouldn't be a surprise to customers as the boxes rattle when picked up. A judge denied hershey's motion to dismiss the case this week but also deferred on bratton's desire to turn it into a class-action suit, the kansas city business journal reports.

        "summary": "The bizarre story of robert durst took a new turn this week as the much-talked-about \" secret witness \" emerged with details on durst's first marriage. Per nbc news, 72-year-old nick chavin showed up at the real estate heir's pretrial hearing for his murder case wednesday — through a back door for security reasons, cbs news reports — saying he was once extremely close to the man he calls \" bobby \" and that they were introduced through writer susan berman, the woman durst is accused of killing. Chavin, who said he considered durst one of his best friends, shed some light on durst's marriage to kathie durst, who disappeared in 1982 ( and whom durst is also suspected of killing ). Prosecutors think berman was murdered because durst feared she'd link him to kathie's death. Chavin, who told the new york times in 2001 that durst hadn't killed kathie, offered testimony in a somewhat different tone wednesday, noting kathie had confided in him she feared durst ( though she'd never said durst had hurt her ) and that her husband was \" impossible, \" the los angeles times reports. Chavin described the dursts ' marriage as \" strange, \" per nbc, noting durst told him it was an open relationship and would go with chavin to clubs looking to hook up. Cbs notes chavin's testimony was part of a \" rare proceeding \" in which testimony is gathered from older witnesses who might not live till the trial, as well as witnesses who fear for their safety. A woman named susan giordano also testified, per nbc, claiming she'd become durst's \" closest friend \" after meeting in 2002 and had wanted to spend her life with him. ( durst says he was on meth during the jinx filming. )",

Cosby has been ordered to give an oct. 9 deposition in a civil suit brought by allred client judy huth, who accuses the comedian of sexually abusing her at the playboy mansion in 1974. Before that date, a court will decide whether to approve cosby's request for a protective order limiting the public release of the deposition, which allred opposes. \" there should be transparency, \" allred says. \" mr.

The findings prove viruses can survive for surprisingly long periods of time in a cold environment, according to eric delwart, a researcher at blood systems research institute in san francisco. \" the dna of viruses is preserved extremely well under cold conditions, \" he says. Delwart's day job at blood systems is to find new viruses that could contaminate the blood supply. But he enjoys looking in odd places too. He got interested in ice cores from high mountain regions, after reading about all the interesting old things the ice contained. \" things like old shoes and arrowheads, \" he says, \" and then i realized this is nature's freezer, which should also contain organic remains. \" delwart had one particular type of organic remains in mind: caribou poop. Just about everything an animal eats can be infected with a virus. And that makes animals, including humans, virus vacuums that suck up every virus in their path. \" i mean we're constantly"

        "summary": "Suspiciously high radiation levels around the austrian town of st. Georgen an der gusen had long fueled theories that there was a buried bunker nearby where nazis had tested nuclear weapons during wwii. Those suspicions came one step closer to being confirmed last week after the opening of a 75-acre underground complex was dug out from below the earth and granite used to seal off the entrance, the times of israel reports. The excavation team was led by austrian filmmaker andreas sulzer, who says the site was \" likely the biggest secret weapons production facility of the third reich \" — a facility that probably relied on forced labor from the nearby mauthausen-gusen concentration camp and may have even been the testing location for a nuclear bomb, the daily mirror reports. The weapons facility was believed to have been manned by ss general hans kammler and situated near the b8 bergkristall factory, where the first working jet-powered fighter was created, international business times reports; sulzer first got wind of the site after seeing references to it in an austrian physicist's diary. \" up to 320,000 inmates are said to have died because of the brutal conditions in the subterranean labyrinth, \" sulzer tells the sunday times, per the times of israel. Those inmates were chosen for skills in physics, chemistry, or other sciences that would advance the nazis ' quest for wmd, sulzer says. Digging at the site was halted by local officials who demanded a permit, but sulzer says excavation will restart next month. \" we owe it to the victims to finally open the site and reveal the truth, \" he says, per the mirror. ( the us is still keeping nuclear warheads around to fight … asteroids? )",

        "summary": "If the hawkins county school system in tennessee had kept its meat in the freezer much longer, the meat might have been older than some of the students it was served to. The county says it's changing its procedures after students at many schools were served pork roast that turned out to have been frozen in 2009, abc news reports. The us department of agriculture says it's safe to keep frozen meat almost indefinitely — though taste and quality will go downhill after four months to a year. According to wjhl, some cafeteria workers say the elderly lunch meat served up to students smelled so bad it stunk up entire schools, and cooks had to slather the meat in gravy to disguise its age. County officials say they're now carrying out an inventory to make sure no old meat is still lurking in school freezers. County commissioner michael herrell went to officials after a cafeteria cook sent him a picture of the meat served on april 22, wate reports. Herrell says the poor-quality meat is especially upsetting because it's a poor area where many kids get free or discounted meals and some rely on cafeteria food for nutrition. \" they go to school, and that might be the only meal they get all day long, and it just very upsets me that these kids are going to school to get that meal, \" he tells wate. \" it just didn't go over well with me when i heard we were feeding these kids meat that's dated 2009. \" he tells abc he worries that younger kids wouldn't be able to tell if there was something wrong with the food they were served.

So say researchers out of new york university in the journal neurology. They studied 2,470 people with an average age of 73 and found that those with breathing disorders during sleep experienced some form of cognitive decline more than a decade before those without the breathing problems ( at age 77 instead of age 90 ). \" we need to increase the awareness that sleep disorders can increase the risk for cognitive impairment and possibly for alzheimer's, \" the lead author tells the new york times. But all is not lost: those who treated their breathing disorders with a continuous positive airway pressure ( cpap ) machine, however, were able to delay mild cognitive impairment or alzheimer's by roughly 10 years, the researchers report in a press release. \" the age of onset of ( mild cognitive impairment ) for people whose breathing problems were treated was almost identical to that of people who did not have any breathing problems at all, \" says the author. \" given that so many older adults have sleep breathing problems, these results are exciting. \" ( snoring and sleep apnea are linked to these health problems, too. )",

The church investigated stone and parker in retaliation for their 2005 south park episode \" trapped in the closet, \" which ridiculed high-level church beliefs and prominent celebrity believers, such as tom cruise and john travolta, reports the village voice. \" you can see that the commanding officer is pissed off, and not enough is getting done, \" said marty rathbun, a former scientology executive who unearthed the internal document that describes the church's move. In what scientology analysts call a \" classic \" investigation, the church reportedly identified stone's and parker's friends, performed public records checks, and went through their trash, all in an effort to dig up dirt on the pair. Why their trash? rathbun explains, \" phone records. Bank records. Personal letters that expose some kind of vulnerability. They ' ll read stuff into the kind of alcohol you're drinking and how much. Prescriptions. They ' ll figure out your diet. They can find out a lot about you through your trash. \" click to read the entire piece.",
