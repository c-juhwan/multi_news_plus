Slate points out that the movie written and directed by greta gerwig has just notched a record on rotten tomatoes. It had 170 reviews as of tuesday afternoon and yet still maintained a 100 % positive rating from critics. ( audiences were a little less kind, at 87 %. ) other movies have a 100 % rating, but none has achieved that rank with so many reviews. Now in second place is toy story 2, which has 163 reviews. \"this is completely amazing and so incredibly appreciated by the entire team that made lady bird, \" gerwig tells rotten tomatoes. \" we are all on cloud nine and using our tomato emoji more than we ever thought possible. \" here's the trailer for the movie, a coming-of-age story about a teenage girl ( saoirse ronan ) in sacramento.

The troubled country singer, who was found dead at her arkansas home yesterday, recently told an interviewer that the dog had found the bullet that killed boyfriend david wilson in another apparent suicide last month, the daily mail reports. \" i didn't find the bullet, the dog did, \" she said. \" it was in the dog's mouth. \" she firmly denied any involvement in the death of wilson, the father of the younger of her two sons, but the probe into his death is ongoing, the local sheriff tells the new york daily news. Fellow country stars took to twitter to pay tribute to the 37-year-old. \" oh my! mindy. Dear sweet girl. This is so sad. It just breaks my heart what addiction continues to take from this life, \" tweeted wynonna judd. Mccready made at least three previous suicide attempts between 2005 and 2008, the ap reports. \" i call my life a beautiful mess and organized chaos. It's just always been like that, \" she said when discussing her turbulent life in a 2010 interview. \" my entire life things have been attracted to me and vice versa that turn into chaotic nightmares or i create the chaos myself. I think that's really the life of a celebrity, of a big, huge, giant personality. \" mccready — who entered court-ordered rehab and put her children into foster care earlier this month — is the fifth cast member of dr. Drew pinsky's celebrity rehab to die in recent years, billboard reports. Pinsky says she reached out to him after wilson's death. \" although she was fearful of stigma and ridicule, she agreed with me that she needed to make her health and safety a priority, \" he says. \" unfortunately it seems that mindy did not sustain her treatment. \"",

Except that in this case, police say the girl grabbed a 4-inch long knife, went back upstairs, and stabbed her sleeping 11-year-old half-sister to death — more than 30 times in the neck, chest, and hands, nbc news and the chicago sun times report. Her apparent motive is perhaps even more shocking: with every stab, prosecutors say she told the victim the younger girl was ungrateful for the older girl's housework; the victim had also punched her sister the night before, authorities say. They allege the 14-year-old then showered to wash off the blood before calling 911, telling police a hispanic male intruder had entered the home the girls shared with their mother — who wasn't home at the time — and did the deed, cnn reports. That led to the lockdown of three nearby schools before the girl's story unraveled. When detectives pointed to strands of hair tying her to the crime, police say she admitted to it, adding that she had contemplated the killing the night before. The girl now faces first-degree murder charges in juvenile court; a decision on whether to move the case to adult court will be made in a few weeks.",

He called on libyans to \" cleanse \" the capital of rebel \" devils. \" gadhafi gave up most of his chemical and biological weapon stockpiles after 2003, but kept ingredients needed to make mustard gas at desert sites, reports the telegraph. Nato officials also fear gadhafi or his supporters could still launch the regime's arsenal of scud missiles — some 240 of them — on libya's civilian population or europe, which gadhafi threatened last week to strike out against in retaliation for nato's involvement in the overthrow of his regime. One scud was fired just days ago from misrata, but apparently missed its target and fell into the sea.",

So what happens next? in this case, ars technica reports, backers told washington's attorney general, who has sued a company that allegedly didn't produce a crowdfunded playing-card project.

In one case, a worker kicked off his very first day of being allowed on the agency's signals intelligence collection system by checking out six of an ex's email addresses; he was doing it for \" practice, \" he said to investigators. He got a demotion, his pay docked, and a recommendation against security clearance, cnn reports. Another employee, who has since resigned, investigated a foreign phone number she'd spotted on her husband's phone, fearing he was having an affair.

Congress overwhelmingly approved a 60-word law called the authorization for the use of military force, which empowered president george w. Bush to retaliate against anyone behind the 9/11 attacks. Interpretation of the law has since expanded to include all military action, including capture and detention, against \" associated forces \" of the 9/11 attackers. The law \" is like a christmas tree, \" said a former bush administration official. \" all sorts of things have been hung off of those 60 words. \" johnsen's article looks at the aumf's tangled history, from its hurried drafting to its 420-1 house vote and its surprising resilience under president obama — despite his pledge to repeal it. Lawmakers have questioned the aumf, as politico reported last year, and now obama really does plan to kill it off, a top administration official tells the wall street journal. But a dozen years after 9/11, obama is still ordering drone attacks and secret raids — often against people who were children when the twin towers fell. \" let the congressional debate begin, \" said rep. Barbara lee, the one lawmaker who voted against the aumf. \" if people think it's worth it, for whatever reason, then let their member of congress vote for it.

Ruqai, who is better known in the jihadi world as abu anas al-libi, was still feeling the effects of the hepatitis c he had contracted years earlier during a stint in an underground prison in iran. Following overtures from muammar al-qaddafi's government, his wife and children had returned to libya in 2010. But libi stayed away, wary of the man he had once plotted to kill. Only when the libyan uprisings started in early 2011 did he follow his family back to libya. But by then it was already too late. His oldest son, abd al-rahman, the only one of his five children who had been born in libya, was dead, shot while fighting for the capital. After that, things moved in fits and starts.

Researchers at the university of hawaii at manoa set out to investigate why. To do so, they conducted \" laboratory microcosm experiments \" involving beach sand, seawater, and sewage.

But over the past decade, scientists have been finding fecal bacteria in beach sand at levels 10 to 100 times higher than in nearby seawater. Tao yan and colleagues wanted to find out why. In the lab, the researchers created microcosms of beach sand and seawater contaminated with sewage to see how the overall bacterial populations, including fecal dwellers responsible for causing illness, would change over time. They found that microbial communities tended to decay much slower in the simulated beach sand environment than in the water, which could help explain why more fecal bacteria are found on sandy beaches affected by wastewater pollution than in the waves.

But over the past decade, scientists have been finding fecal bacteria in beach sand at levels 10 to 100 times higher than in nearby seawater. Tao yan and colleagues wanted to find out why. In the lab, the researchers created microcosms of beach sand and seawater contaminated with sewage to see how the overall bacterial populations, including fecal dwellers responsible for causing illness, would change over time. They found that microbial communities tended to decay much slower in the simulated beach sand environment than in the water, which could help explain why more fecal bacteria are found on sandy beaches affected by wastewater pollution than in the waves.

These animals include waterfowl ( geese, sea gulls, terns, etc. ), wildlife ( deer, beaver, rabbits, bear, etc. ), domesticated animals ( horses, cows, pigs, etc. ), pets ( dogs, cats, etc. ), and humans. Fecal contamination can reach waterways through multiple methods, including direct deposition, stormwater runoff that carries fecal matter from inland, failing or leaking individual septic systems, sanitary sewer systems breakages and overflows, improper diaper disposal, swimmer fecal accidents, improper boat waste disposal, and much more."

Investigators say miller's predecessor douglas shulman — who testified before congress that \" there's absolutely no targeting \" — was aware of the targeting at the same time as miller. As reports surfaced that the scandal went beyond the tea party, some conservative organizations said they were seriously considering suing the irs, politico reports. \" given the sheer scope of maleficence at the irs, there may be a legal recourse, \" a lawyer for a half-dozen targeted groups says. Lois lerner, the irs official who oversees tax-exempt groups, blames the targeting on the agency's cincinnati office, but the effort went a lot further than that, with officials at irs headquarters in washington and at least two other offices involved, according to documents obtained by the washington post. Several congressional panels plan to investigate, and the house ways and means committee has set a hearing for friday morning.

More than a dozen complaints from government watchdog groups asking whether such organizations were violating their tax-exempt status through political spending were ignored, while the smaller tea party organizations — which had small budgets and were much less likely to be buying political ads — saw delays with their applications as they were asked question after question.

Ideally, scientists would have had a few days or weeks ' notice of the strike, which is why \" having some sort of system that scans the sky almost continuously and looks for these objects just before they hit the earth, that probably is something worth doing. \" says the researcher. Meanwhile, a separate study in nature has found the source of russia's meteor strike. Researchers think the rock that hit chelyabinsk broke off from a mile-wide asteroid known as 86039 — resulting in an impact that created 30 times the explosive power of the hiroshima bomb, the independent reports. \" if humanity does not want to go the way of the dinosaurs, we need to study an event like this in detail, \" says one professor.",

According to estimates released thursday, global wine production will be down around 5 % for 2016 as compared to 2015, with floods, drought, and frost hitting vineyards in countries including france, the ap reports. In argentina, production may drop as much as 35 %; in chile, 21 %, which the guardian sees as possibly worrisome for malbec lovers. \" output was greatly affected by exceptional weather conditions, \" says oiv director jean-marie aurand, per bloomberg. \" if there is one product that is vulnerable to weather events, it's wine. \" this year's decline has been linked to the el nino effect, though warming temperatures are starting to shrink wine-growing seasons around the world and could eventually lead to major shifts in what varieties of wine are produced in different countries, reports the guardian. But the news wasn't all bleak: according to oiv's estimates, wine production is up for the year in countries including the australia and the us; our estimated 22.5 million hectoliters is less than half of what the no. 1 producer, italy, will log for the year: 48.8 million hectoliters. With total global production of around 35 billion bottles ( based on an estimate of 259.5 million hectoliters ), there should be enough to go around.

        "summary": "Mitt romney and newt gingrich came out throwing verbal punches — at each other — in tonight's florida gop debate. They traded boast for boast and barb for barb as the first questions presented the contest as a faceoff between the two. Gingrich attempted to appropriate the mantle of ronald reagan, and a combative romney attacked him as an \" influence peddler \" and \" chief lobbyist \" for freddie mac. Gingrich dismissed the slings, saying he's \" not going to spend the night chasing mr. Romney's misinformation, \" to which romney responded: \" you don't have to take my word for the facts. \" in other skirmishes: gingrich, who supports a 15 % flat tax, quips that he'd like to bring everyone's rate \" down \" to that paid by romney, who declares his taxes are \" entirely legal and fair. \" mitt also notes that newt wants a 0 % tax on capital gains, in which case \" i would have paid no taxes \" — because all his income is from investments. Rick santorum asks why, if romney and gingrich consider themselves champions of capitalism, they both supported the bailout of wall street and its \" destructive \" capitalism, instead of letting failed companies fail in a free market system. Romney mocks gingrich's past statement that he worked as a \" historian \" for freddie mac, saying organizations don't pay $ 25,000 a month for six years to \" historians. \" he adds: \" you were making over $ 1 million at the same time people were being hurt \" by freddie mac's decisions. Ron paul says the government owes people a free-market system, but gave americans a \" mess \" instead. All the candidates, except paul, support continuing sanctions against cuba. Gingrich jokes that if fidel castro dies, \" i don't think fidel will meet his maker; i think he's going to the other place. \" romney backs \" self deportation \" for illegal immigrants, a concept that draws a chuckle from the subdued audience. A section of the debate deals with issues close to the hearts of floridians — offshore oil, sugar subsidies, the space program, protecting the everglades and the 2005 battle over comatose patient terri schiavo, whose husband and family disagreed about letting her die. Santorum says his visit to schiavo's hospital as a congressman was only to make certain the judicial procedure was being followed. Gingrich stresses a \" bias in favor of life \" is automatic for those on death row, indicating schiavo should have been afforded the same bias.",

            "The terri schiavo case was a right-to-die legal case in the united states from 1990 to 2005, involving theresa marie schiavo (; december 3, 1963 – march 31, 2005 ), a woman in an irreversible persistent vegetative state. Schiavo's husband and legal guardian argued that schiavo would not have wanted prolonged artificial life support without the prospect of recovery, and elected to remove her feeding tube. Schiavo's parents disputed her husband's assertions and challenged schiavo's medical diagnosis, arguing in favor of continuing artificial nutrition and hydration. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] the highly publicized and prolonged series of legal challenges presented by her parents, which ultimately involved state and federal politicians up to the level of president george w. Bush, caused a seven-year delay before schiavo's feeding tube was ultimately removed. On february 25, 1990, at age 26, schiavo sustained a cardiac arrest at her home in st. Petersburg, florida. She was successfully resuscitated, but had massive brain damage due to lack of oxygen to her brain and was left comatose. After two and a half months without improvement, her diagnosis was changed to that of a persistent vegetative state. For the next two years, doctors attempted speech and physical therapy and other experimental therapy, hoping to return her to a state of awareness,"

        "summary": "An attorney for aaron hernandez says he isn't convinced his high-profile client committed suicide. Prison officials say the former nfl star hanged himself with a bed sheet, but attorney jose baez says he will conduct his own investigation alongside the prison's because hernandez didn't seem remotely suicidal, reports tmz. Meanwhile, media outlets are struggling to make sense not only of hernandez's death but of the dramatic downfall from stardom that led to his life sentence on a murder conviction. Related coverage: hernandez probably won't be known as a convicted murderer much longer, reports usa today. The 27-year-old had appealed his conviction, and his death means that the verdict will likely be vacated by the massachusetts appeals court because he wouldn't be able to assist in his own defense. Cnn and the washington post have similar stories with a broad look at his life. He'd been an athletic prodigy in his hometown of bristol, conn., and both stories note that hernandez was especially close to his dad, who died after hernia surgery when hernandez was 16. He'd begun hanging out with a tougher crowd by then, and trouble began escalating after his father's death and continued at the university of florida and beyond. This new york times focuses on the 2013 murder that resulted in his life sentence. He and victim odin lloyd, a semi-pro player, were dating sisters at the time, and lloyd was apparently suspicious the night hernandez picked him up. He texted his sister that he was with \" nfl, \" adding, \" just so you know. \" hernandez was accompanied by two friends from bristol at the time, the story suggesting he never could quite shake those roots. As for the 2012 case in which he was accused, and acquitted, of killing two men, it all stemmed from a spilled drink in a nightclub. But the two cases may be connected: one line of speculation was that hernandez killed odin because he learned of the 2012 killings and was talking too much, per this post at sportsgrid. The boston herald has a timeline of his criminal cases here. An april 16 column in the boston globe about his recent trial described hernandez as \" serene \" in court. Photos \" captured a man who didn't seem to have a care in the world — a murder defendant blowing kisses to his family, waving to his friends, a study in confidence. \" massachusetts has a spotty record when it comes to prison suicides, reports the globe.",

A canadian couple has been awarded $ 15,000 in damages, to be paid by neighbors who have also been banned by the judge's jan. 19 decision from spreading manure within about 1,000 feet of david and joan gallant's property. The calgary herald reports the gallants bought their place in rural new brunswick in 2001; between then and november 2013, things went south with their indian mountain neighbors, lee and shirley murray. The gallants alleged that in that month, load upon load of \" fresh, unseasoned, wet, raw manure \" was dumped by the murrays onto land adjacent to their own property. To get a sense of scale, there was enough of it that it was visible via a google earth photo. The gallants say nearly an entire year passed before they complained to the new brunswick farm practices review board; a short time later, the manure pile was removed. But when the board in december 2014 determined the manure positioning was an \" unacceptable farming practice, \" the gallants alleged the murrays retaliated in the form of a long scratch on their car. Early the next year, the gallants sued, outlining a litany of other alleged transgressions, including rocks forced onto their land via a snowblower. The murrays say they will appeal. America isn't free from its own manure-related debacles. Wjar reported in september on a tussle between rhode island neighbors. Gerald zarrella had been hosting weddings on his exeter property, and claimed his neighbors dumped chicken manure near it in retaliation; the neighbors were ordered to move the manure. ( horse manure is at the heart of a legal dispute over religious freedom. )",

( wjar ) a man was ordered friday to move a pile of manure placed near the property line of a neighbor, who has been hosting weddings in exeter. Gerald zarrella hosts weddings on his property and said his neighbors, james and diane lynch, are retaliating against him because of it. A large pile of chicken manure appeared last week on the lynch property, just feet from zarrella's land. The smell all but ruined a wedding that weekend. A second, smaller pile of manure was dumped there on thursday. Outside of washington county superior court in wakefield friday, nbc 10 news approached james lynch and asked him why he didn't move the manure. He repeatedly replied that he was being harassed when confronted with questions. Afterward, zarrella said, \" can you imagine somebody who harassed somebody would have the guts to say, ' leave me alone, you're harassing me. ' he harassed me, he harassed the people at the wedding. \" james lynch was ordered to move both piles of chicken waste to the far side of his property and cover it with top soil by wednesday, days before sarah hill richmond and matthew scoggins get married on the 32-acre property next",

National geographic reports that researchers began studying the disease records and wind patterns of japan about a decade ago; that country sees the highest incidence of the disease, with roughly one out of 150 youngsters contracting it. What they found: the disease struck the most children about 2.5 days after wind from the heavily-agricultural northeast china plain reached them, and the infection peak subsided once the wind shifted direction, science reports. Hawaii and southern california see instances of the disease, too; as many as 4,000 cases occur annually in the us. But the disease — which causes young children's arteries to become inflamed and, if left untreated, can cause permanent heart disease or even death — is on the rise, with more cases being reported in australia and southeast asia, scientific american reports. What's still unknown is which airborne agent causes it, though the researchers did note in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences \" the unexpected finding of the candida species, \" a type of fungus, \" as the dominant fungus from aloft samples ( 54 % of all fungal strains ). \" study co-author jane burns says, \" the data suggest that people are doing something new [ since world war ii ] in northeastern china. Could there be some agricultural practice or crop or activity that is new since the 1960s? we need to figure out what the activity or condition is that creates these aerosols carried by the winds. \" ( click to read about a mystery disease that strikes one family on the planet. )",

Martina seyah, who brought her 2-year-old daughter, irena, to get the shot, says parents in the neighborhood are very worried their children could get measles or other diseases. Just as liberia is getting ready to declare itself ebola-free, another disease has cropped up. This january a measles outbreak erupted. So far this year, there have been 562 cases; seven were fatal. \" to have this number in just the first quarter of the year is definitely a huge outbreak, \" says dr. Zakari wambai, head of the world health organization's immunization program in liberia. He says in the eight years he has been in the country, there has never been a measles outbreak anywhere near this scale. Now cases are being reported all across the country. The eruption of measles, he says, is a direct result of the ebola outbreak. That's because when ebola hit, it"

        "summary": "Few details are known about david bowie's death sunday — his family has not revealed where he died or even what type of cancer he had, and, as the new york times reports, even some people who had been working closely with bowie on his latest projects didn't know he was dying. One of the few collaborators bowie did tell was ivo van hove, the director of lazarus, a stage musical bowie co-wrote that's playing at the new york theatre workshop until jan. 20. Van hove says bowie told him about his illness during the early stages of working on the show, in november 2014, and asked him to keep the information secret. \" it was immediately clear it was very serious, \" says van hove, who kept his promise and didn't disclose the information to anyone else before bowie's death. ( van hove told a dutch radio station that bowie had liver cancer, though rumors floating around before his death suggested lung cancer. ) what is clear is that bowie's \" sudden burst of new projects, \" as the times puts it, was likely meant as a farewell, as both the times and the sydney morning herald report. Bowie had basically vanished from public view after a heart attack in 2004, then released a \" powerful, elegiac single about memory and farewell \" three years ago, the herald notes; even the video for \" where are we now? \" \" looked like a farewell and sounded like it, \" the herald notes. Bowie surprised his record company with both of his final two albums, the next day in 2013 and blackstar this year, in both cases swearing his producer and the musicians he worked with to secrecy until the album was delivered to the label. It wasn't until after bowie's death that his producer confirmed blackstar was meant as a \" parting gift \" from bowie. Lazarus, the musical, also makes more sense in retrospect: says the artistic director of the workshop, \" what seemed not too long ago intriguingly complicated, ambiguous, and opaque now seems pretty clear: a man who was yearning for immortality. \"",

        "summary": "The deal that greek prime minister alexis tsipras made under intense pressure after 17 hours of talks is a lousy one that will doom the country to many more years of economic misery, according to the international monetary fund. A leaked imf report says that greece's level of debt is \" highly unsustainable \" and for its economy to have any chance of recovering, creditors will have to either write off much of its debt or extend payment deadlines by 30 years, reports the guardian. The leaking of the report, which was presented to eurozone leaders before talks began, appears to be a \" tactical move \" from the imf, notes the new york times, which describes greece and the imf as \" strange bedfellows. \" the report reveals a serious split between the eu and the imf on how to deal with greek debt, and it was made public just hours before the greek parliament was due to vote on the bailout plan, reports the bbc. In today's vote, tsipras is unlikely to have the full support of his own left-wing party, which has been firmly opposed to tightened austerity measures like the ones the deal contains, notes the guardian. Tsipras himself has strongly criticized the deal, saying \" the policies imposed on us were irrational \" but it was the best greece could get, the ap reports. Ahead of the vote, one of the nation's two deputy finance ministers resigned in protest of the bailout deal, reports enikos; per reuters, nadia valavani said that \" it is impossible to continue being a member of the government. \"",

Per court records, gravano, 72, was released in arizona sept. 18, the new york post reports. He ' ll be on federal parole the rest of his life. Gravano was an underboss and consigliere with the gambino crime family when he turned rat in 1991 — at the time, the highest-ranking mafia member to become a turncoat — helping authorities nab john gotti and 38 other mobsters. In exchange, he was sentenced to his first stay in prison, just five years for 19 murders. After that stint in prison and another in witness protection, he settled in arizona ( where he was living when gotti's brother ordered a hit on him ), but he was sentenced to another 20 years behind bars when he pleaded guilty to running an ecstasy ring in 2001 after being arrested the year prior. He was sentenced in 2002, azfamily.com reports.

It simply opens up debate in the senate on the house measure — and paves the way for harry reid and democrats to restore obamacare funding. At that point, the legislation gets sent back to the house, where john boehner is expected to have a big decision to make right on the deadline for a government shutdown.

        "summary": "\" we may never know \" why stephen paddock fired on a las vegas crowd, killing 58 and injuring hundreds, says clark county sheriff joe lombardo. Lombardo tells the las vegas review-journal that interviews with paddock's girlfriend, marilou danley, and entire \" family tree, \" including two ex-wives, have yet to reveal a motive for the shooting. \" all those things that you would expect to find, we have not found, \" lombardo says. For example, paddock, a video poker player, had no known gambling debts; an autopsy has revealed no brain abnormalities; and danley has said she had no concerns about paddock's mental health, lombardo says. More: the ongoing investigation has, however, prompted another revision to the shooting timeline, which \" could change even more, \" lombardo says. According to lombardo, paddock checked into a free-of-charge room at mandalay bay on sept. 25, three days earlier than previously known. After three days, he moved to a corner suite he paid for on the 32nd floor from which he would carry out the shooting. The new revelation that a guard encountered paddock before his shooting spree raises the fundamental question of why it took so long to stop him, observes the la times. Police say the guard made it to a hallway phone to call hotel security after being shot, but they're not sure how long that took; paddock shot an estimated 200 rounds into the hallway. And a rep for mandalay bay owner mgm resorts sounded a bit defensive: \" we cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated publicly, and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate. \" it's believed paddock visited mesquite, nev., several times before oct. 1. But though cbs news reports paddock might've visited a shooting range there, lombardo says he's unaware of videos rumored to show paddock performing shooting drills. Lombardo also dispels rumors that paddock met with a prostitute. While authorities still don't think danley was involved in paddock's plans, abc news reports she's been added to a federal travel watch list. Her designation as a tsa \" selectee \" means that if she tries to board a plane or exit us borders, she ' ll be subjected to extra screening and authorities will get a heads-up. Abc news has another tidbit by way of sources: that as a perk due to his casino spending, paddock was given access to the hotel's service elevator.",

The corpus christi cross project broke ground at the abundant life fellowship campus off interstate 37 on sunday. Pastor rick milby says the massive cross will eventually stretch 95 feet wide and 210 feet high, making it the biggest in the western hemisphere, reports the houston chronicle. The idea for the project came to milby after he first spotted a huge cross in houston and heard about \" lives that were changed, suicides that were aborted, relationships that were restored because of the influence of the cross, \" he writes on the project's website. A cross in illinois stands just under 200 feet, notes atlas obscura, which adds that the faa requires a light on anything above that height. The corpus christi cross will be so big that the design allows for \" a two-foot deflection at the top — it will actually sway in the wind two feet back and forth, \" milby tells kris tv. And as for whether such winds can topple it, milby says the concrete foundation's 24 piers will be anchored 48 feet deep, \" so if it were to blow over, it would pull up about three acres of land with it. \" once completed, the cross will be visible from 5 miles away by land and 10 miles by air; planes flying into corpus christi international airport will descend about a half-mile to the east. The cross is expected to take about a year, and $ 1 million, to complete. It will still fall far short of the world's tallest cross — a 495-footer in madrid. About $ 142,000 has been raised so far.

A psychologist who testified said couch should also have no contact with his parents during his one or two years in treatment; he actually used the term \" affluenza \" to describe what the teen apparently suffers from.

She's not having any luck in the uk, though, where apparently no clinic is willing to fertilize the woman with her daughter's eggs ( she froze three in 2008 ). The anonymous woman reportedly says it was her daughter's dying wish to have her become a surrogate, but it's not in writing. The mother is now trying to export the eggs to a clinic in new york that has apparently agreed to attempt in vitro fertilization for roughly $ 90,000, but her request to actually export the eggs out of the country has been denied three times, so the case is going to be heard in the uk's high court. While it's technically possible for a post-menopausal woman to become pregnant thanks to hormonal supplementation, reports abc news, the chances of becoming pregnant are lower and the risks to the older woman's health are greater. The main complications are gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and miscarriage. But it can be done: a woman recounted in the new york times the story of her 61-year-old mother giving birth to her son in 2011. Still, the unidentified woman in this most recent story says she wants to honor her daughter's wish; if this final legal bid to export the eggs fails, they will be destroyed in 2018, a decade after being frozen. ( a 49-year-old woman who gave birth to her own grandson in 2012 said it was like \" babysitting for a few months. \" )",

While some total eclipses can last up to an hour, sky watchers will have just four minutes and 43 seconds to take in the sight of the blood moon as it just skims earth's shadow, reports cbs san francisco. Those west of the mississippi river will have an ideal view as the moon begins its trek into earth's shadow at 3: 16am pdt, cnn reports. The total lunar eclipse — the third of four in a \" tetrad \" occurring in 18 months — will be visible beginning at 4: 58am. A partial eclipse may be seen across the country, as well as in south america, india, china, and russia. Nasa says that four blood moons within 18 months is rare, occurring only a few times in the last 2,000 years. The next one will occur on sept. 28. It's not all oohs and aahs, though: cbs notes the timing of the blood moon just ahead of easter and this passage in the king james bible: \" the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the lord comes. \" one american pastor says that means a \" great worldwide event \" is to come, the daily mirror adds. John hagee predicts \" we're going to see something dramatic happen in the middle east involving israel that will change the course of history in the middle east and impact the whole world. \" ( here are the first and second blood moons in the tetrad. )",

Let me explain; my partner and i were attending an event for the huffington post, for which i often write: game changers 2011, in a venue space on hudson street. As we entered the space, we saw that about 200 occupy wall street protesters were peacefully assembled and were chanting. They wanted to address governor andrew cuomo, who was going to be arriving at the event.

            "Urban outfitters appears to have caved to the navajo nation. As of wednesday, the trendy chain store had removed the word \" navajo \" from the description of about 20 items on its website, including the \" navajo flask \" and the \" navajo hipster panty. \" other items that bore the navajo moniker include a pair of \" navajo \" socks, a \" navajo \" print tunic, and \" navajo \" feathered earrings. Urban outfitters has replaced the word \" navajo \" with \" printed. \" this is a coup for the navajo nation, which sent urban outfitters ' chief executive, glen senk, a cease and desist order earlier this month, demanding the name \" navajo \" be pulled from the store's products. The tribe did not take issue with the items themselves — designers borrow ( steal? ) from indigenous cultures all the time. But the navajo nation has at least 10 trademarks on the word \" navajo, \" which covers clothing, textiles and household products. \" when products that have absolutely no connection to the navajo nation, its entities, its people, and their products are marketed and retailed under the guise that they are navajo in origin, the navajo nation does not regard this as benign or trivial, \" brian lewis, an attorney for the tribe told the associated press.",

Consider that reputation was 2018's top-selling album and its fourth single, \" delicate, \" became \" a sleeper hit this year \" and \" a massive radio hit. \" plus swift is a grammy darling, the youngest artist ever to snag album of the year with fearless at age 20 and the first woman to win twice when 1989 triumphed in 2016. So wither the love? ok, reputation was dark and different. And it wasn't released in time for the 2018 grammys, so it had to wait a year. There was also the controversy after 1989 beat kendrick lamar's \" astounding \" to pimp a butterfly — and \" this year's eight-album lineup is deservedly hip-hop and r&b-heavy \" with albums like lamar's black panther soundtrack, drake's scorpion, and cardi b's invasion of privacy, notes spanos. But is the grammys really about fairness and representation? not to one commentator: \" the grammys isn't a benevolent process, \" writes maeve mcdermott at usa today. \"... And if post malone got an album of the year nod, which says it all about the kinds of music the recording academy deems grammy-worthy, swift sure as hell deserved to be recognized too. \"",

Gary and cindy hipps have sued clemson, sigma phi epsilon, and three members of the frat for $ 50 million, reports cbs news. Their two lawsuits allege that a confrontation took place between their son, tucker, and a frat member on a bridge before he fell to his death. They also allege that members of the frat have erased text messages to that effect. \" i guess you can call that a cover-up, \" says gary hipps. This much is known: on sept. 22, 2014, tucker and about two dozen other pledges went out for an early morning run with three frat members. Tucker never returned to campus, and he was reported missing that afternoon. The lawsuits allege that one frat member confronted tucker on a bridge over the seneca river because he had failed to pick up mcdonald's breakfasts for everyone as ordered, reports the state of columbia. The lawsuits do not say how tucker went over the bridge, only that he did so and landed on rocks. Nobody on the group run claims to have seen the fatal plunge, which the hipps find hard to believe. They say they're not interested in money and won't consider a settlement that would keep the circumstances of their son's death private. \"we're not going to do anything that will disallow us to tell the truth, \" says cindy hipps. \"i'd like us to have our day in court. \"",

Hipps was found dead last september near a lake after participating in a run with other students. Now his parents are suing the university and a fraternity over the death of their son and allege a cover-up, reports cbs news correspondent mark strassmann. Cindy and gary hipps filed two civil suits, seeking $ 50 million in damages against the university, the fraternity and three of its members. Those suits allege there was a fatal confrontation on the bridge. They claim text messages reveal the fraternity members ordered hipps to show up with food for everyone. He arrived empty-handed, and they allegedly were angry. Hipps family \" we believe they know and they're refusing to tell it. I guess you can call that a cover-up, \" gary said. Nineteen year-old hipps, a clemson pre-law student, was their only child. \" it never crossed my mind that we would be sitting here today, sending him off to college, that he would never come home, \" cindy said. The couple has spent six months grieving the death of their son. \" he was always into everything. He always wanted to be the center of attention when he was in school, \" cindy said. Did he jump? was he pushed? investigators say they've explored every possible explanation, but have reached a dead end.

            "Investigators looking into the death of clemson university sophomore fraternity pledge tucker hipps say their case is at a standstill. Hipps was found dead last september near a lake after participating in a run with other students. Now his parents are suing the university and a fraternity over the death of their son and allege a cover-up, reports cbs news correspondent mark strassmann. Cindy and gary hipps filed two civil suits, seeking $ 50 million in damages against the university, the fraternity and three of its members. Those suits allege there was a fatal confrontation on the bridge. They claim text messages reveal the fraternity members ordered hipps to show up with food for everyone. He arrived empty-handed, and they allegedly were angry. Hipps family \" we believe they know and they're refusing to tell it. I guess you can call that a cover-up, \" gary said. Nineteen year-old hipps, a clemson pre-law student, was their only child. \" it never crossed my mind that we would be sitting here today, sending him off to college, that he would never come home, \" cindy said. The couple has spent six months grieving the death of their son. \" he was always into everything. He always wanted to be the center of attention when he was in school, \" cindy said. Did he jump? was he pushed? investigators say they've explored every possible explanation, but have reached a dead end.

        "summary": "In what may be a deeply unfortunate first, three people in a flight simulator died in a plane crash at wichita's mid-continent airport yesterday. The three died when a twin-engine beechcraft king air, whose pilot was also killed, crashed into a flight training center just after takeoff. Around 100 people usually work in the building and they've all been accounted for, although authorities say the bodies haven't been removed yet because of concerns the building may collapse, the kansas city star reports. Heavy equipment was used to search for four people thought to have been in another flight simulator room, but it turned out to be empty. One of five people injured in the crash is in serious condition, while the other four have been treated and released. Pilot mark goldstein, a recently retired air traffic controller, declared an emergency and tried to return to the runway shortly after taking off, saying he had lost his left engine, according to air traffic control tapes. The ntsb is investigating, but it could be months before the agency determines the cause of the crash. The king air that crashed was 15 years old, and the owner of aircraft safety firm air data research describes the plane as a \" workhorse \" with a \" good, solid \" engine. \" i can't think of any really spectacular problem that's been found on them, \" he tells the wichita eagle. \" a lot of airplanes are known for problems.

        "summary": "This much is clear about the case of three women alleged to have been kept against their will in a london home for more than 30 years: it's going to take a while to fully unwind what happened. But the picture emerging suggests that the women were controlled by their captor couple through brainwashings and beatings in conditions akin to a cult. Police today said the two 67-year-old suspects charged in the case are natives of india and tanzania who came to britain in the 1960s, reports ap. At some point after that, the male suspect met two of the three victims \" through a shared political ideology and... They lived together at an address that you could effectively call ' a collective, ' \" says police official steve rodhouse. \"how this resulted in the women living in this way for over 30 years is what we are seeking to establish, but we believe emotional and physical abuse has been a feature of all the victims ' lives, \" he says, as per the telegraph. He said the women had some degree of freedom but were bound by what he called \" invisible handcuffs. \" the victims, now being helped by a charity, are a 69-year-old malaysian, a 57-year-old irish woman, and a 30-year-old briton. Police are investigating whether the male suspect fathered the 30-year-old with the irish woman, reports the guardian. Her birth was registered, making it unclear how her existence went unnoticed all this time by government agencies. She can reportedly read and write and is described as intelligent, though she apparently never went to school, says the newspaper. Police say they're working to gain the trust of the victims, but it will take time. \" this must move at their pace, not anyone else's, \" says rodhouse.",

Officers are also investigating whether the youngest woman, who is aged 30 and thought to have been born inside the house, was the daughter of the 57-year-old irish woman who eventually reached out for help last month in a phone call to a charity she had seen on the news.

Homeowners, meanwhile, have hired their own engineering consultants and are threatening to sue.

The office of management and budget rule bars federal officials from commenting on sensitive economic data until one hour after its release, mainly because the comments can have a disruptive effect on the market. And indeed, after the tweet, the yield on the 10-year treasury note increased, then rose even more after the strong jobs report came out, notes the wall street journal. Trump's tweet was quickly retweeted thousands of times, particularly in financial circles, reports reuters. The report is issued at 8: 30am on the first friday of the month, and the president is typically briefed the night before, notes the new york times. Larry kudlow, director of the white house national economic council, says he discussed the report with the president on thursday and defended trump's tweet as being neutral. \"his tweet basically said, like everybody else, we await the jobs numbers, \" kudlow told cnbc, per reuters. \"you can read into that 10 different things, if you want to read into it. \" lawrence summers, who was treasury chief under president clinton, disagreed. If this had happened in either the clinton or obama white house, \" it would have been a major scandal — with all sorts of investigations following on, \" he tweeted.",

Months later, though, us special operations forces are still using the hws, which \" potentially endangers the lives of service members in combat, \" per a washington post investigation. Thermal drift ( the most serious of the several defects with the sight ) can cause a shot to be off target by six to 12 inches — \" one of the worst types of failures, \" per an unnamed employee quoted in the lawsuit, \" since most users won't notice the problem until their life is on the line. \" problems with the hws first emerged in 2007, when the norwegian military noticed that the holographic crosshairs would distort in cold weather. But eotech didn't tell the pentagon, even as it continued supplying sights. After that, it was discovered that faulty seals caused the sights to fog up in humid weather. Again, eotech kept quiet. Finally, the fbi, while conducting ballistic tests, discovered the thermal drift, which occurs in both hot and cold temperatures. A pentagon rep confirmed that some troops still use the sights, adding that military officials \" have an unshakable commitment to the safety \" of us armed forces. Another military rep tells the post the sights are only used in instances that \" the limitations of the equipment \" don't put troops at risk.

In a recent study, researchers find that caffeine use disorder may be more of a problem than many doctors realize. \" there is misconception among professionals and lay people alike that caffeine is not difficult to give up. However, in population-based studies, more than 50 % of regular caffeine consumers report that they have had difficulty quitting or reducing caffeine use, \" says study author laura juliano via eureka alert. Do you have the disorder? quartz points to three key symptoms: you want, or have tried, to quit or reduce your caffeine intake. You know caffeine leads to health problems for you — it makes it hard to sleep, for instance — but you keep using the stuff. You suffer from withdrawal symptoms, which can include headaches or nausea, if you don't get your daily dose. Before you panic, however, the site notes that researchers find 400 mg per day to be ok for healthy adults; that's between two and three eight-ounce cups. Pregnant, anxious, or an insomniac? cut that amount in half, cbs dc reports. And if you need help, you're not alone: \" through our research, we have observed that people who have been unable to quit or cut back on caffeine on their own would be interested in receiving formal treatment — similar to the outside assistance people can turn to if they want to quit smoking, \" juliano says.",

His mom — who is 9 months pregnant — tells ktla that she found the puncture wounds and started trying to suck the venom out, as she had seen on bonanza. Bad move, says a state wildlife official, because it could make the venom spread faster. \" absolutely don't do that, \" he warns. Fortunately, all ended well. The boy is recovering — after the venom spread through his leg — and mom is fine. Toddler bit: in bay point, a 2-year-old girl was bit by a rattlesnake while playing in her backyard, reports the san jose mercury news. The girl was airlifted to a children's hospital on oakland, and her condition wasn't made available. Authorities caught the snake nearby. The state poison center gets about 300 calls a year about rattlesnake bites, notes the san francisco chronicle, but they are particularly dangerous for kids because of their smaller size.",

The olympic song is named \" the snow and ice dance, \" but the comparisons don't end there. The website of a chinese business magazine says the two songs both feature a piano as the main instrument, have a similar opening, and almost exactly the same tempo, per the new york times. You can listen to both songs for yourself here and here. \" does anyone want to burst out into ' let it go ' at 01: 14? \" one youtuber commented on the olympic song, sung by duo sun nan and tan jing, per the bbc. Many others have accused officials of plagiarism and theft. The musical brouhaha is far from the only criticism associated with the beijing olympics, however. Environmentalists argue beijing doesn't have enough snow to host a winter olympics, while others have slammed china's human rights record. Beijing won the olympics over almaty, kazakhstan, after oslo, munich, and stockholm dropped their bids. Tokyo was awarded the 2020 summer olympics also on friday, per bloomberg view.",

The report concludes that republicans are out of touch with young people, preach to the choir, and need to reach out to minorities. \" there is truth in each of these, which is how they got to be platitudes. \" the report's take on outreach is \" heavy on committee formation … and tokenism, \" the review complains; its top suggestion, for example, being that minorities take charge of minority outreach. \" in reality, selling the republican party's appeal is more about the appeal than about the selling. … the heavy lifting is going to require imagination and an appetite for risk. \" michael tomasky at the daily beast agrees. \" back in the 1980s, the voters kept the democrats out of power until they were persuaded that the party really had changed, \" he notes, and democrats responded by \" jettisoning some longtime shibboleths. \" republicans need to do the same. Their problems with minorities run deep, and many voters believe their chief economic goal is to protect the rich. At the washington post, dana milbank notes that reince priebus'speech skipped right over the report's recommendations on gay rights and immigration. Priebus \" took pains to avoid offending the conservative orthodoxy that is antagonizing segments of the electorate that republicans need if they are to win. \" at one point he said, to use milbank's paraphrase, that \" all are welcome in the republican party — as long as they're conservative. \" erick erickson at redstate complains that the report's recommendations to swap primaries in for caucuses and limit debates will benefit monied candidates like mitt romney.

It started in february when magi, annoyed at a driver who took up two handicap-parking spaces in her apartment's lot, posted a photo ( since removed, per the sydney morning herald ) of the car on facebook. The 39-year-old didn't include any identifying elements in the photo, the abc notes — but the next thing she knew, a complaint was filed and she was in an abu dhabi courtroom, where she was found guilty under a uae cybercrime law of \" writing bad words on social media about a person, \" hit with a $ 2,700 fine, and told she'd be deported from abu dhabi, where she's lived since 2012. Asked by abc what she had done, she replied, \" i have zero idea. I used the internet. \" she adds she was forced to sign documents written in arabic, with no translation provided. When magi showed up to pay the fine last weekend, things went more awry: she was arrested and taken into custody. \" no one is telling me what's going on, \" she told abc. \" they were about to put me in the male lockup and then they turned me away, and no one knows what to do with me. \" \" this is normal practice in abu dhabi, \" according to a uae department of foreign affairs and trade statement, per the australian, while the aussie foreign affairs minister says she expects magi to be deported in \" a very short time \" and that consular officials were helping magi — an assertion magi doesn't agree with, per the abc. A human rights researcher tells the herald people take a chance when they use social media in stricter countries like the uae, saying, \" basically anyone who … makes any comment online about another person could fall foul of [ cybercrime and defamation ] laws if someone complains. \" ( a us man was thrown in jail in the uae for ranting about his employer. )",

According to cnet, echizen specifically warns about the peace sign because of its ubiquity in japan and because it makes it easy to match fingers with faces. Echizen says anyone can now steal fingerprints from a photo posted to social media — no high-tech setup necessary — as long as the fingers are well-lit and in focus. He warns that the stealing of fingerprints is potentially more dangerous than having a password hacked because passwords, unlike fingerprints, can be changed, international business times reports. The bbc notes fingerprints are increasingly being used for access to everything from phones to bank accounts, not to mention secure buildings.
