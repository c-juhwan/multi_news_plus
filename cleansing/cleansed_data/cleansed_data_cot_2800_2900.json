The 34-year-old started classes on the florida campus in 2005, and took some time off when her kids were born — and when then-husband tiger woods ' cheating scandal erupted.

Five more celebs who just earned their degrees: lakers guard jodie meeks graduated saturday from the university of kentucky, where he spent three years playing for the wildcats before leaving for the nba in 2009. He had been attending classes every off-season to finish his degree in business marketing, the los angeles times reports. \" it's gratifying to myself and my family to see me walk across that stage, \" meeks said last week. \" you never know how long your career will last. Once you have a degree, you have it forever. \" that's dr. Puff daddy to you. Rapper sean combs was awarded an honorary doctorate in the humanities from dc's howard university, which he attended for two years before dropping out in 1990, rolling stone reports. \" ain't no homecoming like a howard homecoming, \" dr. Combs said while giving the commencement address saturday. Earlier this month, fellow rapper ll cool j also got an honorary degree; his was a doctor of arts from boston's northeastern university — and his daughter graduated with honors during the same ceremony, vibe reports.

Potter, who formed her band during her two years at the university, will also speak at commencement. Led zeppelin rocker jimmy page got an honorary doctoral degree in music friday from boston's berklee college of music, rolling stone reports. \" music has so much power across so many avenues, \" he said at the ceremony. \" to be in a position to do the thing you're best at, which is making music, and bringing joy and pleasure to other people, it can't be much better than that.

The bbc reports that wind speeds have come down to 110mph, reslotting the hurricane into the category 2 category from a category 3, per a national hurricane center advisory on thursday morning. But the winds aren't expected to die down further, and florence's forward speed toward the coast is starting to slow, meaning once it makes landfall somewhere along the coast of the carolinas — right now expected for late thursday into friday, per cnn — it will likely linger, without much motion, near the coastline, which could prove disastrous for those in its path. That's because the relentless rain may not let up for some time, leading to heavy flooding, even further inland. Huge storm surges of up to 13 feet are also feared. \" do not focus on the wind speed category, \" the national weather service warned in an early thursday tweet. \" this is going to be a mike tyson punch to the carolina coast, \" a fema official says, per the bbc.

But when the team analyzed the skull fragments, they realized that the skulls neither fit the bill for homo sapiens nor neanderthals but that they shared characteristics of both human species. Ultimately, the researchers were unable to positively determine exactly what kind of human the skulls belong to, opening the door to a wide range of intriguing possibilities.

        "summary": "Milk: it does a body good... Or does it? though they say their findings should be interpreted cautiously, swedish researchers have identified a correlation between heavier milk consumption and a higher mortality rate among women. Karl michaelsson and his team tracked 61,433 women for an average of 20 years; they ranged in age from 39 to 74 at the start of the study. In looking at women who drank an average of 2.9 cups of milk a day compared to those who drank less than one ( an average of about 2 ounces ), researchers discovered there was no reduction in fracture risk — but the heavier milk-drinking group was 1.93 times more likely to die during the study, reports livescience. ( the study, published in the british medical journal, also tracked a group of men; a much less significant increase in mortality risk was identified among those with a higher intake. ) michaelsson thinks a milk sugar called galactose may play a role. He suspects it can trigger oxidative stress and inflammation: \" the funny thing is that if you provide galactose to experimental animals, they will die faster \" due to those two things, he says. A press release explains the team's analysis uncovered a positive relation between milk intake and a biomarker of oxidative stress. However, consumption of fermented milk products ( like yogurt ) affected the biomarker oppositely. \" our results may question the validity of recommendations to consume high amounts of milk to prevent fragility fractures, \" they write, while noting the findings shouldn't yet be used to shape dietary recommendations.

            "Fired fbi chief james comey used his private gmail account hundreds of times to conduct government business — and at least seven of those messages were deemed so sensitive by the justice department that they declined to release them. The former top g-man repeatedly claimed he only used his private account for \"incidental \" purposes and never for anything that was classified — and that appears to be true. But justice acknowledged in response to a freedom of information request that comey and his chief of staff discussed government business on about 1,200 pages of messages, 156 of which were obtained by the post. The cause of action institute, a conservative watchdog group, filed a freedom of information lawsuit for comey's gmail correspondence involving his work for the bureau. The justice department responded that there were an eye-popping 1,200 pages of messages for comey and his chief of staff that met the criteria. Justice released 156 of them but refused to hand over seven emails because they would \"disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions. \" and another 363 pages of emails were withheld because they discussed privileged agency communications or out of personal privacy concerns.

Their evidence: there were no skid marks until right before the point of impact, and the skid marks were straight, indicating rodas lost steering control just before the crash; and the fire spread quickly in the front of the vehicle — indicating a fluid leak, since typically the rear ( where the engine is ) would burn more quickly. They also say they saw evidence of a fluid trail leading up to the skid marks. Tmz also reports that the porsche was acting up and kept stalling as one of rodas ' employees tried to get it back into the shop — and that's why rodas ended up behind the wheel. Walker jumped in asking for a ride, because he hadn't driven in the car yet. But police are also investigating the possibility that rodas and walker were involved in a street race when they crashed, tmz reports, and radar says investigators think the car may have been traveling more than 100mph in a 45mph zone.

Speaking in agartala, biplab deb cited the hindu epic mahabharata, stressing that a character's ability to describe a 5,000-year-old battle from miles away proved both the internet and satellite technology existed in ancient india, reports the bbc. Deb was swiftly mocked — \" krishna really should have streamed the bhagavad-gita on facebook live, \" rutgers-newark south asian history professor audrey truschke tweeted — but supporters came out of the woodwork, too. Tripura gov. Tathagata roy, for one, said \" it is virtually impossible to conceive of devices, \" including flying chariots described in the myth, \" without some kind of prototype, \" per the times of india. Critics say this is part of a wider trend of romanticizing history by the bharatiya janata party, of which deb is a member, per newsweek. In september, a bjp member said the airplane was first mentioned in the hindu epic ramayana, per the bbc, while prime minister narendra modi, also of bjp, has previously claimed plastic surgery was invented in ancient india. \" the anti-intellectualism and regressive streak from sections of the bjp continues to astound and worry, \" critic rupa subramanya tweeted. \" rather than solve today's problems they're busy romanticizing a fictional past that never existed. Pathetic and embarrassing. \" still, deb is sticking to his guns. \" my country had the technology years ago, which no country had, \" he said wednesday, per ndtv, acknowledging there are \" narrow minded people who find it tough to believe this. \" ( this indian lawmaker wants to ban pdas. )",

        "summary": "With both gas prises and anger on the rise, president obama has decided to allow new drilling in alaska's national petroleum reserve. Lease sales in the 23.5 million-acre reserve — which serves as home to millions of migratory birds, two caribou herds, gray wolves, and other wildlife — have been held just six times between 1999 and 2010; they ' ll now be held annually. A senior official said the new lease sales would not touch environmentally sensitive areas, reports the los angeles times. It's just one component of an oil-production plan that touches many corners of the us, announced in obama's weekly radio address today. Among obama's other moves: speed up environmental reviews along the atlantic coast from north carolina to northern florida so that seismic studies to determine how much oil and gas lies there can begin; extend all gulf of mexico and arctic ocean leases that were affected by a temporary moratorium on drilling imposed after last year's bp oil spill; and hold gulf lease sales this year and next, reports the washington post. His announcement followed recent passage of three bills in the house that would expand and speed up offshore oil and gas drilling. The white house had announced its opposition to all three bills, and a senior administration official said obama's plan is not a reaction to the house measures, though ap notes obama is adopting some of the bills ' provisions.",

Vice president nicolas maduro, chavez's chosen successor, is leading the country for now, but an election will be called within 30 days. It's not clear whether maduro will inherit enough of his predecessor's popularity to keep the chavismo movement alive and defeat an opposition coalition expected to be led by henrique capriles, who lost an election to chavez in october. Maduro may be able to defeat an opposition no longer united by hatred of chavez, though he may face a power struggle with powerful rival diosdado cabello, who has many allies in the military, reports the guardian. It describes chavez's relatives as a \" wild card \" — his brother and two adult daughters \" have the power to help unite or fracture chavismo. \" whoever wins will have to deal with rising unrest, a deeply troubled economy, and a bitterly divided nation, the new york times notes. The us says it is open to restoring diplomatic relations no matter who wins the upcoming election, though a white house spokesman stresses the vote must be \" free and fair and credible, \" cnn reports. Before the battle to replace chavez kicks off in earnest, there will be seven days of national mourning punctuated by a friday morning funeral expected to be one of the biggest latin america has ever seen.",

Pope francis was the most talked about topic on facebook worldwide this year, according to new data from the company, which measured the number of posts mentioning a particular person or event, including related hashtags. The word \" election, \" broadly, was the second-most talked about topic followed by the royal baby. Cyrus came in at no. 7 on the list, one spot behind another viral phenomenon, the harlem shake. More somber subjects like the boston marathon bombings and the deaths of margaret thatcher and nelson mandela also ranked among the top 10 on facebook's list.

        "summary": "Nine striking dining hall workers at the world's richest university were arrested friday after holding a sit-in to demand better wages and health benefits. The workers — who are among 750 food service workers on strike at harvard — were arrested alongside two union officials after blocking the streets of harvard square, the boston globe reports. The arrested workers, all women, were charged with disorderly conduct and will appear in court monday, when more protests are planned, reports the harvard crimson. The workers say health care costs have become unaffordable, especially since many of them only work eight months a year, when all the dining halls are open. Student supporters of the strike were kicked out of a joint reunion event for the classes of 1971, 1976, and 1986 friday after chanting pro-strike slogans, the crimson reports. The guardian notes that harvard, which has an endowment of $ 37.6 billion, recently announced a $ 10 million study on poverty, and the irony is not lost on alumni, around 1,000 of whom have pledged to withhold gifts until the workers get a fair contract. One of the cooks tells the paper that she \" thought getting a job at harvard meant i wouldn't struggle anymore. \" but last summer, she says, \" i had to borrow money to buy diapers for my daughter. \" ( before the strike began earlier this month, students stockpiled food. )",

The alleged scam worked like this: american standard would advertise homes for sale for below-market value, usually on craigslist; interested customers were made to pay $ 199 for a \" listing of houses \"; victims would later find out the homes on the list were either not for sale or didn't exist. American standard told customers they \" could purchase the houses by simply taking over the homeowners ' mortgage payments \" and hired employees who \" spent most of their time fielding phone calls from angry customers and homeowners, \" according to an indictment. Prosecutors say american standard created impossible hoops to jump through if any customer demanded a refund. Davenport was arrested in december at the bill and hillary clinton airport in arkansas with $ 104,000 in cash. He and american standard salesperson cynthia rawlinson appeared in court wednesday. They've been charged with wire fraud, mail fraud, and more. Davenport played with the ataris from 1995 to 2004 and appeared with the band during a reunion tour in 2013, rolling stone reports.

The zetas — who count many mexican army deserters among their number and are famed for beheading their enemies — control the drug trade along much of the lower rio grande.

The nokia 3310 was \" perhaps the best-loved and most resilient phone in history, \" according to the independent. Users especially loved its solid build, long-lasting battery, and the included game snake ii, reports the verge. However, little is known about the updated version. Venturebeat simply notes its price point means the phone might appeal to \" nostalgic former owners for use as a second phone. \" the release is aimed at european users, and there's no word on when the new devices could be available in north america.

        "summary": "A hunter in utah says he got a startling surprise this weekend after killing a coyote: the coyote turned out to be a gray wolf, a rarity in those parts. The hunter notified state wildlife authorities, who confirmed that he had indeed shot a 3-year-old female wolf near the city of beaver. Though there's no way to be certain, it's believed to be the same wolf spotted near the grand canyon this fall, the first such visitor there in 70 years. Because gray wolves are protected in utah, the hunter could face charges. \" we are still investigating, but it seems initially that it was a case of mistaken identity, \" a state official tells the salt lake city tribune. The wolf had been wearing a tracking collar that had been placed around her neck in cody, wyoming, in january of this year. The best guess is that she then split from her pack and wandered more than 500 miles south. \" this shows how vulnerable gray wolves are and how important real protection is, \" an official with the center for biological diversity in arizona tells livescience. \" what we need is a response that follows the endangered species act and prevents these kinds of occurrences from happening again. \" ( another tale of a wandering wolf had a happier ending. )",

        "summary": "Pity north korea: even when, in typical grandiloquent style, it threatens the \" fools, idiots, and blockheads \" in the south korean media with \" a merciless sacred war, \" it manages to muck that up, reports the wall street journal. Apparently the north got really peeved at south korean media's coverage of its children's day celebrations ( the north's propaganda was compared to the nazi youth ). So the north threatened to blow up several south korean newspapers and tv stations ( not for the first time ), offering longitude and latitude coordinates for its targets ( for the first time ). The problem? pretty much all those coordinates were wrong. One newspaper was listed as \" 37 degrees 56 minutes 83 seconds north latitude and 126 degrees 97 minutes 65 seconds east longitude \" — of course, there are only 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so those numbers made no sense ( the same error appeared in the korean and english versions of the story ). Trying to figure out where those coordinates are, as the north korea tech blog did, would most likely put you in gangwon province, quite a distance east of the target in seoul. In fact, only one set of coordinates was even close, and even that was a building across the street. To enjoy the full effect of north korea's flowery rhetoric, check out its original \" open ultimatum \" at the kcna website.",

More surprising is that authorities also have charged the bartender who allegedly served her before the crash, along with two men accused of buying her drinks, reports abc13. Police say that veronica rivas visited the crescent city connection sports &amp; oyster bar on feb. 28, then later slammed into a vehicle and killed 36-year-old shayla joseph and joseph's 3-month-old son, braylan, in southeast houston. Joseph had been on maternity leave at the time. Rivas, who police say was twice above the legal limit, has been charged with intoxicated manslaughter. Bartender amy allen, 40, is charged with criminal negligence by allowing the underage rivas and a 17-year-old companion to drink at the bar, without checking their ids. Devin jackson, 24, and john medina, 23, are charged with buying drinks for a minor, reports nbc dallas/fort worth.

Spicer also insisted that flynn hadn't broken the law. Regardless, even republican senators — including senate majority whip john cornyn — are now calling for an investigation into flynn and his talks with the russian ambassador, though cornyn wouldn't go so far as to say flynn should testify, according to cnn. Meanwhile, trump insists leaks, not flynn's resignation, are the \" real story. \" \" why are there so many illegal leaks coming out? \" politico quotes the president as saying. The washington post has a list of 10 questions about flynn's actions and resignation that still haven't been answered, including if flynn will face prosecution or if spicer or the vice president will apologize to america for lying, deliberately or otherwise.

The sudanese leader was visiting for a two-day african union summit, and a south africa high court judge yesterday ordered al-bashir to stay in the country while the court decided whether he should be arrested and handed over to the icc, notes cnn; the judge also ordered all ports of exit and entry to stop al-bashir from leaving. But before the hearing on his arrest could be completed, al-bashir's private jet reportedly departed a pretoria military airport, per the new york times, and sudan's minister of information told reuters that his boss would arrive back in khartoum at around 6: 30pm local time. This apparent escape is just the latest in the icc's frustrating attempt to get someone, anyone, to turn al-bashir over. Since the first indictment against him in 2009, the sudanese president has \" danced around the arrest warrants, \" per nbc news, traveling to countries where he doesn't fear arrest and avoiding all others. When the icc got wind he'd be heading to south africa, it put out a statement imploring south africa to \" spare no effort in ensuring the execution of the arrest warrants. \" un secretary-general ban ki-moon reminded icc member countries today that, as members, they have an obligation to carry out those warrants. But, as nbc notes, many african nations haven't been willing to go the extra mile for the icc because they feel africa has been unfairly targeted by the court at the hague. Sudan's state news agency says there will be a press conference after al-bashir returns, per cnn.",

The offending tweet, since deleted, linked to an article titled \" how this woman lost 44 pounds without any exercise. \" the article documented the story of 31-year-old australian mom simone harbinson, who suffered a recent \" waterfall of health scares \" that included appendix cancer and complications from her illness and the resulting surgeries. She started eating for comfort after her cancer diagnosis and gained 35 pounds. She eventually set her mind to losing the weight, but because of her condition, she couldn't exercise like she used to. Instead, she started meal-prepping and following a nutrition program that resulted in her losing 44 pounds, undergoing an \" incredible … mental transformation. \" that positivity didn't translate to the entire internet, per page six and the washington post, which note that folks didn't appreciate clicking on a weight loss headline and finding that a woman with cancer had lost the weight. \" cancer is not a diet plan. Delete this, \" tweeted ex-nfl player matthew cherry, perhaps misinterpreting ( as many others apparently did ) that harbinson lost the weight as a direct effect of the cancer. But some clearly understood harbinson's story and are still taking cosmo to task for promoting a sick woman's weight loss as the main focus.

That's according to an amicus brief filed in federal court by the justice department on friday, reuters reports. According to nbc news, the justice department found that the practice violates the 14th amendment and that bail amounts that don't take poverty into account \" unlawfully discriminate based on indigence. \" it says courts must find a better way to make sure impoverished defendants show up to court than keeping them in jail. The brief was filed in the case of maurice walker. Walker, who is poor and has mental health issues, was arrested for being a pedestrian under the influence in calhoun, georgia, the huffington post reports. Court is only held once per week in calhoun, and walker was kept in jail for six days because he couldn't afford to pay the $ 160 bail for his freedom. The city argued that it's perfectly legal to set bail amounts based on the seriousness of crimes without any consideration for a defendant's ability to pay it.

The actual policy agenda that harms the rich — the restoration of clinton-era tax rates for incomes over $ 400,000 a year, higher investment taxes to help fund obamacare, regulation of wall street — is curiously absent from the list. Instead the journal wanders through a farrago of partisan fever dreams. For instance: maybe the critics are afraid that mr. Perkins is onto something about the left's political method. Consider the recent record of liberals in power. They're the ones obsessed with the koch brothers and other billionaires contributing to conservative causes, siccing journalists to trash them and federal agencies to shut them down. \"siccing journalists to trash \" the koch brothers can be translated as \"a number of news reports and opinion commentary has criticized the koch brothers. \" just like what happened to the jews in nazi germany! i follow the right-wing media pretty closely, and i have no idea what federal agencies"

But, the journal's editors argue, the fact that so many people disagreed with it proves the basic thrust of his argument: \"the vituperation is making our friend's point about liberal intolerance — maybe better than he did. \" liberals are mocking wildly rich people who compare their plight to the victims of the holocaust, and even if this mockery does not currently rise to the level of persecution of the holocaust itself, really the spirit of the thing is about the same. The editorial proceeds to defend its thesis by rattling off a list of terrible things that have happened to one percenters in the obama era. The actual policy agenda that harms the rich — the restoration of clinton-era tax rates for incomes over $ 400,000 a year, higher investment taxes to help fund obamacare, regulation of wall street — is curiously absent from the list. Instead the journal wanders through a farrago of partisan fever dreams. For instance: maybe the critics are afraid that mr. Perkins is onto something about the left's political method. Consider the recent record of liberals in power. They're the ones obsessed with the koch brothers and other billionaires contributing to conservative causes, siccing journalists to trash them and federal agencies to shut them down. \"siccing journalists to trash \" the koch brothers can be translated as \"a number of news reports and opinion commentary has criticized the koch brothers. \" just like what happened to the jews in nazi germany! i follow the right-wing media pretty closely, and i have no idea what federal agencies"

        "summary": "In 2013, about a year after they started dating, kayden and elijah coleman of philadelphia found themselves rushing to tie the knot. Kayden, who was born female but was at that point a decade into gender reassignment therapy, had stopped taking hormones for six weeks to undergo a double mastectomy, and soon learned that his aching back and bloated belly were in fact clues that he was 21 weeks pregnant, reports the san francisco chronicle. Now kayden, who is 29, and elijah, who is 27, have taken to instagram and youtube to document their unique story as they raise their now 22-month-old daughter azaelia. Many social media followers are supportive, with one person commenting, \" you guys are real, funny and so cute! praying for your continued love for each other, baby and blessings! \" life hasn't been all roses since kayden's pregnancy forced his status as a transgender man into the open, reports the new york daily news. Not only did it lead to a brief rift with elijah's family, but kayden's growing belly drew awkward glances, and one woman told him in a shop, \" honey, you look like you're pregnant! \" he applauds the doctors and nurses but also says he felt like \" an experiment \" during his four-day labor, and struggled through postpartum depression for a year. \" now it feels great, \" kayden tells the daily mirror. \" i couldn't imagine, and don't want to imagine, life without her. She is amazing. \" azaelia calls kayden \" daddy \" and elijah \" poppy, \" and her parents plan to tell her about the unusual pregnancy when she is 5. \" as long as azaelia is loved and cared for, i doubt she ' ll care. \" ( kayden isn't the first man to become pregnant. )",

Explanations including dust devils, flooding, hurricane-strength winds, and even ufos have been offered, but the mystery was finally solved when researchers caught the rocks in the act, national geographic reports. Scientist richard norris and his cousin james norris, an engineer, put gps trackers on the stones, surrounded them with cameras, and were amazed to discover that the movement was caused by ice — in one of the hottest and driest spots on the planet. The pair discovered that on rare occasions when conditions are just right — with rain on the usually dried-up lake bed called the \" racetrack playa, \" followed by sunshine and wind — plates of thin ice push the rocks along the muddy desert floor, sometimes as quickly as several feet a minute, reports npr. Richard norris tells the los angeles times that they found the playa covered with ice when they went to inspect the instruments last december. The next day, \" we were sitting on a mountainside and admiring the view when a light wind kicked up and the ice started cracking, \" and \" suddenly, the whole process unfolded before our eyes, \" he says. \" there was a side of me that was wistful because the mystery was no more, \" james says.

It called the race based on exit interviews as the polls closed at 9pm. De blasio, the city's public advocate ( an elected position ) easily defeated republican joe lhota, a former giuliani deputy. De blasio presented himself as an unapologetic liberal and as a clear break from bloomberg. \" i ' m calling for fundamental progressive change, \" he said after voting today. One item on his agenda is universal early education, to be paid for by a tax hike on the rich. In a pre-results analysis, philip rucker of the washington post saw it this way: \" the de blasio administration would become a laboratory for modern progressivism — a test of whether an anti-establishment activist can effectively manage a sprawling municipal government and whether his policy prescriptions can actually lessen growing inequality between the rich and the poor. \"",

            "Bill de blasio, who transformed himself from a little-known occupant of an obscure office into the fiery voice of new york's disillusionment with a new gilded age, was elected the city's 109th mayor on tuesday. His landslide victory, stretching from the working-class precincts of central brooklyn to the suburban streets of southeast queens, amounted to a forceful rejection of the hard-nosed, business-minded style of governance that reigned at city hall for the past two decades and a sharp leftward turn for the nation's largest metropolis.

            "Bill de blasio, who transformed himself from a little-known occupant of an obscure office into the fiery voice of new york's disillusionment with a new gilded age, was elected the city's 109th mayor on tuesday. His landslide victory, stretching from the working-class precincts of central brooklyn to the suburban streets of southeast queens, amounted to a forceful rejection of the hard-nosed, business-minded style of governance that reigned at city hall for the past two decades and a sharp leftward turn for the nation's largest metropolis.

            "Sen. Ted cruz, speaking as the results of the nevada caucuses were being tallied, argued tuesday evening that he was the only republican left in the race who could beat donald trump. \"they're still counting the ballots so we don't know the exact results, but i want to congratulate donald trump on a strong evening tonight and i want to congratulate the grass roots – the conservatives across this country who have come together behind this campaign, \" cruz told supporters at a ymca in las vegas. Cruz, who was battling with sen. Marco rubio for a second-place finish, argued that he had history on his side since he won the iowa caucuses, the first of the gop presidential nominating contests. \"when we started this campaign nearly a year ago, there were 17 candidates in the race. The role of the first four primaries historically has been to narrow the field and we have seen the first four states do exactly that – narrow the field, \" cruz said. \"now at this point we've had four primaries, history teaches us no one has ever won the nomination without winning one of the first three primaries. And there are only two people who have won one of the first three primaries – donald trump and us. \" \"the first four states has shown the only campaign that has beaten donald trump and the only campaign that can beat donald trump is this campaign, \" he said, urging conservatives and those who want to beat hillary clinton to consolidate behind him. He never mentioned rubio by name, but he slashed at him as a washington insider and over his positions on issues such as immigration. And he set sky-high expectations for super tuesday, one week from today, when 11 states including his home state of texas will go to the polls. \"one week from today will be the most important night of this campaign, \" cruz said at the rally, his last event before flying to houston to start a day of campaigning there wednesday."

            "University of missouri media professor melissa click has been charged with third-degree assault for her role in harassing reporters during coverage of the november campus protests, according to reporting from local abc affiliate kmiz. In a widely-shared video, click could be seen telling reporters they had to leave and trying to grab a photojournalist's camera. \"we need some muscle over here! \" she shouted to students after the photojournalist refused to leave. Click apologized for the incident after the clip went viral and resigned her professorship in the school of journalism. However, she still holds an associate professorship in the department of media, despite calls for her resignation from local republican politicians. If click is found guilty of the misdemeanor assault, she could face a maximum of 15 days in jail, a $ 300 fine, or both. [ image via screengrab ] — — >>follow alex griswold ( @hashtaggriswold )",

The somewhat confusing development is a technical one: the salt lake tribune reports the board denied wanda barzee an early release in july, but an official now says that \" upon further review and advice from legal counsel, the board must count time spent in federal custody toward ms. Barzee's state sentence. \" barzee, 72, served eight years at a federal prison in texas; the state charge was related to a separate plot to kidnap smart's cousin in the weeks after barzee and husband brian david mitchell took smart. She pleaded guilty to that charge and was sentenced to one to 15 years. Smart's father expressed surprise. \" we were told she was getting out in 2022. \" ( fox13, however, reports her release will come five years before it was expected she would be eligible for parole, which would have been 2023. ) fox news has strong words from smart herself, via a statement: \" it is incomprehensible how someone who has not cooperated with her mental health evaluations or risk assessments and [ someone ] who did not show up to her own parole hearing can be released into our community. I am trying to understand how and why this is happened and exploring possible options. \" fox news adds that mitchell is serving two life sentences.",

Jason kessler was whisked to safety by police after being chased by a crowd of protesters, some of them shouting \" shame! \" and \" murderer! \", the daily progress reports. \" i disavow any political violence and what happened yesterday was tragic, \" he said outside city hall in charlottesville, va., before the chaos began. Police say a 47-year-old man was arrested for allegedly spitting in kessler's face. In other developments: before the conference, kessler released a statement blaming police for purposefully creating \" the catastrophe that led to a melee in the streets of charlottesville and the death of a counterprotester, \" cnn reports. Kessler, a charlottesville resident, says he plans to hold more events in the city. Charlottesville's mayor and police chief have rejected accusations that they didn't do enough to stop clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters, the guardian reports. Law enforcement \" did respond to and break up various fights in and around emancipation park prior to the unlawful assembly declaration, \" chief al thomas said in a statement sunday. Protesters denouncing white supremacist groups gathered in cities around the country sunday for marches and candlelight vigils, the ap reports. In new york city, protesters marched to trump tower, calling for the president to condemn the groups behind the charlottesville rally. A 20-year-old university of nevada, reno student identified as one of the torch-carrying marchers protesting the removal of a statute of gen. Robert e. Lee says he doesn't advocate violence.

The aclu accused authorities of trying to move the event because they disagreed with the beliefs of the organizers. \" the aclu of virginia stands for the right to free expression for all, not just those whose opinions are in the mainstream or with whom the government agrees, \" said executive director claire guthrie gastanaga in a statement.

Trump used that criticism several times on the campaign trail, though it was called out as false by the washington post fact-checker blog, in part because the approval required the green light from nine separate federal agencies, not just the state department. Meanwhile, nancy pelosi joined the calls for gop rep. Devin nunes, chairman of the house intelligence panel, to recuse himself from the investigation over criticism that he's too close to the white house. On cnn monday night, nunes defended his meeting with someone at the white house the day before he called a news conference to allege that trump associates might have been picked up in \" incidental \" surveillance. \" the congress has not been given this information, these documents, and that's the problem, \" he said to justify his trip to the white house. \" this is executive branch. \"",

Graham's campaign later clarified the senator was joking, the state reports. As politico notes, sisters — as well as daughters and other female relatives — have in fact filled the role of first lady when necessary. For example, james buchanan ( one of two presidents who had never been married when they became president, the other being grover cleveland ) didn't wed while in office, and his niece effectively served as flotus. Cleveland did eventually marry while in office. Thomas jefferson was also unwed while president, as his wife had died almost two decades prior; c-span notes that their daughter served as \" hostess \" while he was president. The last unmarried president was woodrow wilson, whose wife died while he was in office, though he did marry again the following year.",

While scientists already knew that star formation was more prolific billions of years ago, the herschel telescope has for the first time been able to start measuring the rate of decline, scientist steve eales said at the launch. Three billion years ago \" galaxies were forming stars at... Five times the rate we know today, \" he told afp at the agency's offices in noordwijk in the western netherlands. Eales said the herschel telescope's infrared technology allowed scientists to see galaxies, mainly spiral ones like the milky way, that were previously hidden from scientists ' view by cosmic dust clouds. The telescope, launched a year ago to study star formation, is the biggest ever sent into space, orbiting at a distance of 1.5 million kilometres ( 932,000 miles ) from the earth.

New cosmic observations from the european-built herschel infrared space observatory have revealed previously hidden details of star form tucked away in distant galaxies. One snapshot reveals what researchers called an ' impossible'star caught in the act of forming. The new images show thousands of these galaxies and beautiful star-forming clouds draped across the milky way. These images were part of the presentation of the first results from herschel, which was launched on may 14 of last year, today during a major scientific symposium held at the european space agency ( esa ), which runs the observatory, in noordwijk, netherlands. These results challenge old ideas of star birth, and open new roads for future research. Related: black holes can devour entire galaxies? ' impossible'star in a statement, european scientists said herschel has discovered an \" impossible \" star so massive it would dwarf our own sun, but they are perplexed",
            "Herschel telescope shows galactic star formation is slowing noordwijk, netherlands — the formation of new stars in galaxies like the milky way has declined five-fold in the last three billion years, initial findings of the european space agency's herschel telescope showed thursday. While scientists already knew that star formation was more prolific billions of years ago, the herschel telescope has for the first time been able to start measuring the rate of decline, scientist steve eales said at the launch. Three billion years ago \" galaxies were forming stars at... Five times the rate we know today, \" he told afp at the agency's offices in noordwijk in the western netherlands. Eales said the herschel telescope's infrared technology allowed scientists to see galaxies, mainly spiral ones like the milky way, that were previously hidden from scientists ' view by cosmic dust clouds. The telescope, launched a year ago to study star formation, is the biggest ever sent into space, orbiting at a distance of 1.5 million kilometres ( 932,000 miles ) from the earth. Scientists already knew that 10 billion years ago \" there were these galaxies that were forming stars really fast, \" said eales, but previous telescopes were unable to see up to a distance of 10 billion light years. \" we haven't been able to fill that gap until today"

The earthquake boosted the pressure under the newly listed world heritage site, researchers find, per the guardian. \" our work does not say that the volcano will start erupting, but it does show that it's in a critical state, \" the scientists note. They reached their conclusions by using japan's vast trove of geological data following the quake, investigating it for disturbances. The earthquake hurt the earth's crust most in the area around the volcano. \" we cannot establish a direct relation of cause and effect between quakes and volcanic eruptions, even if statistically the former lead to an increase in the latter, \" a researcher says. What's more, the data can't say \" when an eruption will occur or what size it will be, \" he tells the daily mail. \" all we can say is that mount fuji is now in a state of pressure, which means it displays a high potential for eruption. \" fuji last erupted in 1707, sending ash as far as tokyo, more than 60 miles away.

But it is still an active volcano, standing at the junction between the pacific, eurasian and philippine tectonic plates.

The airline reported a loss of more than $ 386 million last year. Higher fuel prices, increased competition, and the weak pound have been named as some of the causes, but the airline's ceo says the \" root cause \" is terrorism in egypt and tunisia ( two of the airline's biggest markets ) and the collapse of the market in turkey due to unrest there. The announcement that the airline had gone into administration and all flights had been canceled came at 4am local time monday, the guardian reports, and some would-be travelers were informed their flights were canceled just minutes before they were scheduled to take off. It's not clear how many travelers will be refunded for tickets and any other costs they may have incurred, such as hotel stays they now can't use. About 2,100 employees of the airline have also been left without jobs, though other airlines have expressed interest in hiring monarch employees.",

        "summary": "President trump has signed into law a bill so controversial that mike pence had to cast a tie-breaking vote in the senate when two republicans refused to support it: the rollback of president obama's protection for planned parenthood funding. The bill allows states to withhold title x federal family-planning grants from planned parenthoods and other organizations that perform legal abortions, npr reports. Federal law already bans the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion, and the repeal of obama's rule is a victory for conservatives who don't want any federal funding to go to centers that provide abortions along with other services, the wall street journal reports. The bill was signed behind closed doors and trump didn't comment on it publicly, though marjorie dannenfelser, president of the susan b. Anthony list nonprofit, issued a statement saying trump is moving toward his goal of stopping abortions from being performed in the us, the washington post reports. \" this week the pro-life movement had two huge victories: first, the swearing-in of justice gorsuch, and now, president trump will undo former president obama's parting gift to the abortion industry, \" she said. Opponents said the new law could deprive millions of people of family planning services. \" people are sick and tired of politicians making it even harder for them to access health care, \" said planned parenthood spokeswoman dawn laguens.",

Former president hosni mubarak had appointed shafiq to the prime minister position in the dying days of his regime, forever tainting shafiq with the brutal crackdown that killed more than 800 protesters in 18 days. \"shafiq will never return ( legally ) through the ballot boxes, \" declared protester amr sayed. Sayed does not belong to a political party but says he will vote for the muslim brotherhood candidate to prevent a shafiq victory. \"there will be change, \" sayed said. \"forty percent of egypt is young men. If shafiq wins, we will overturn everything into fire and destruction. He can only win through fraud with the help of the military. \" egypt protesters torch candidate's headquarters yasmina muslemany / nbc news housewife nasreen ahmed demonstrates at cairo's tahrir square against presidential candidate ahmed shafiq. Mostafa al shimi, a retired military officer at tahrir square, said he had to follow orders throughout",
            "Mohammed abed / afp / getty images a protester waves egypt's national flag during a demonstration in cairo's tahrir square on june 5, 2012 exasperated by their failure to shape events in their country since last year's ouster of president hosni mubarak, thousands of egyptian revolutionaries were back in tahrir square on tuesday. The trigger for the latest wave of protests was saturday's conviction of mubarak and a top aide over the killing of demonstrators during the uprising that began in january 2011 — the protesters claim that the verdict whitewashed many other regime figures, and they suspect that the life-imprisonment sentence will not stand. More than that, they are demanding the disqualification of mubarak's former prime minister ahmed shafik from the june 16 presidential-election runoff against muslim brotherhood candidate mohamed morsy. But more protests in the iconic square are unlikely to change the power dynamic that has sidelined the revolutionaries, who now find themselves repeating failed patterns and hoping for a different result. For all their fervor, those on the streets are relatively isolated from the wider egyptian population — and lacking a coherent strategy. Tahrir square, after all, is not the nexus of power in egypt, and those gathered there could stay put for weeks or months without changing the power arrangements around them. That's a significant change from 18 months"
