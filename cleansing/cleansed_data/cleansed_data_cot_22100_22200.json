In this case, our aging hero, dr.

        "summary": "Parents, it turns out, aren't necessarily the first to spot signs of autism in their children. Close friends and grandparents — and especially grandmothers — are consistently helpful in getting earlier diagnoses, researchers report in the journal autism. After surveying nearly 500 parents of children with autism, and then following that up with surveys of nearly 200 friends and family members referred by the parents, they found that one in four parents described others noticing signs before they did, while half the family and friends say they noticed signs first but were often hesitant to say anything to the parents. The earlier the diagnosis, the better a child's behavior, iq, and overall treatment will be, researchers report in a futurity press release, which makes the case for including the wisdom of a child's inner circle when it comes to health concerns. Late last year, the atlantic reported on a group of grandmothers who each raised at least one child with autism and who were recruited to spot signs in the next generation. \" they're very invested in their grandchildren — they're watching their grandchildren, interacting with them, and they're good raters of their grandchildren's behavior, \" a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics says. \" ignorance is no match for an army of grandmas. \" ( mris might be able to diagnose autism in infants before symptoms appear. )",

A similar scene played out in a park near a new york courthouse, where counter-protesters sounded air-horns and banged pots and pans in an effort to silence an anti-shariah rally. In st. Paul,",

        "summary": "The sec's decision to sue elon musk and seek his ouster as chairman of tesla came after musk pulled out of settlement talks at the last minute, reports cnbc. Under the deal, musk would have paid a fine but admitted no wrongdoing in regard to his infamous tweet in august about having secured funding to take tesla private. However, musk would have been barred from acting as chairman for two years, and cnbc's david faber reports that musk couldn't live with that \" blemish \" on his record. Instead, he will fight what he sees as an \" unjustified \" action. Related developments: investors rattled: tesla shares were down 13 % friday morning, reports business insider. It notes that musk's august tweet suggested going private at $ 420 a share, but it's possible the stock could close around $ 250 on friday. Real danger: a wall street journal story suggests the news poses a threat to the very survival of the company. For one thing, tesla has no succession plan in place. If investors lose confidence amid the chaos, the company might not be able to raise money it needs to operate. And if customers lose confidence, tesla could face a rash of devastating cancellations. More so than a lot of companies, \" tesla requires positive news flow around the future of the company, \" as one financial analyst puts it. Criminal case? the sec complaint is a \" road map to criminal charges, \" says new york times reporter jim stewart in a cnbc interview. The complaint, he says, \" talks about the [ short sellers ] and the implied motive that he wanted to punish the shorts, which would be a manipulation. \" also, the feds could ban musk from acting as ceo not just of tesla but of any public company, notes the times, calling it \" one of the most serious remedies the sec can impose against a corporate executive. \"",

        "summary": "What started off as an idea in may 2014 and turned into logistical and technical gymnastics in the months leading up to the big event has just been pulled off. One thousand people from all over italy gathered in a field in the northern town of cesena to perform the 1999 foo fighters hit \" learn to fly \" — all to try to convince the actual five-man band, which hasn't played in the romagna region since 1997, to return. The result, as av club puts it, is \" a hell of a sound. \" moreover, the singers, drummers, bassists, and guitarists all look like they're having a blast. Viewers seem to be enjoying it as well; the video, posted yesterday to youtube, has notched more than 4 million views as of this writing. \" what we did here is just a huge, huge miracle, \" brainchild and project head fabio zaffagnini says to the camera at the end of the performance. Zaffagnini dubbed the project rockin ' 1,000 and raised nearly $ 50,000 via crowdfunding to pull it off, reports loudwire. And he's not the first; last year a crowdfunded campaign to get the band to play in richmond, va., proved successful. The object of zaffagnini's affection has certainly taken notice. The band is already set to play in casalecchio di reno, italy, about an hour from cesena, in november, reports billboard, and not long after the video went live, the official foo fighters twitter account released a simple tweet: \" che bello, cesena. \" about eight hours later came this update: \" ci vediamo a presto, cesena.... Xxx davide. \" this translates to, \" see you soon, cesena, \" and davide is, presumably, dave grohl. ( see how much money the richmond, va., fans raised to get the band to play. )",

While walking on a gravel road heading to assist gliniewicz — who had said he was checking out three suspicious individuals — the officers heard a shot that one described as \" muffled. \" it led the officers down a footpath near a swampy area, reports the chicago tribune. Five to seven minutes later, the officers found gliniewicz facedown in tall grass, per the report, released thursday. He wasn't breathing and there was blood on his neck and coming from his nose, reports the northwest herald. His \" hand was empty in a position that would lead [ one ] to believe he was possibly holding a gun, \" the report adds. His gun was missing, but it was later found a few feet away, reports abc7. Meanwhile, police are investigating a stash of \" hundreds of pieces of military equipment \" found in the basement of a community center where gliniewicz ran his explorers youth program, per fox 32. Though the group was unauthorized to request equipment from the law enforcement support office program, text messages from gliniewicz's phone allegedly suggest he forged the police chief's signature to acquire the goods, including bulletproof vests, ballistic helmets, airsoft guns, gas masks, ammunition, flares, and computers. Police dogs also reportedly smelled drugs, though none were found. Police are trying to determine if gliniewicz was selling the military surplus, though there's no proof of that yet.

        "summary": "\" this is a deplorable way to treat a veteran who risked his life in combat for our nation, \" is illinois sen. Tammy duckworth's characterization of what has happened to miguel perez jr. The mexico-born 39-year-old spent roughly three decades as a legal permanent resident here, she says. But after serving two tours in afghanistan with the us army, perez was in 2010 convicted of drug charges; he was diagnosed with ptsd post-service, and after receiving free drugs from a friend, he ended up passing a bag containing cocaine to an undercover cop. He was sentenced to 15 years on delivery charges. Perez reportedly thought he had citizenship because of his service. He didn't, though his children and parents do; cnn reports perez came to the us as an 8-year-old when his father, a soccer semi-pro, was offered a job. Midway through his sentence, ice started deportation proceedings, and his retroactive application for citizenship was turned down this month. And so on friday he was removed from the country. Lawyer chris bergen tells nbc news his client \" was dumped in one of the most dangerous areas of the mexican border \" with no money, wearing his orange prison garb. Perez told the chicago tribune on thursday night all he had on him was thermal underwear and a toothbrush and toothpaste. His lawyer says they are appealing the decision. Earlier this year, perez went on a hunger strike, saying he'd \" rather die in the country i fought for than in a place that's not my home. \" the tribune notes drug cartels often try to force deported veterans into their ranks, and perez suggested his life would be in peril.",

And the news is not good: writing in the journal drug and alcohol dependence, a university of maryland school of public health researcher says their \" results suggest that energy drink users might be at heightened risk for other substance use, particularly stimulants. \" specifically, they found a significant increase in drug use among 25-year-olds who regularly consumed energy drinks in the five years prior — and the links to cocaine, alcohol, and prescription stimulants were especially strong. Among their findings: out of 1,099 participants recruited for the study while in college, more than half ( 51.4 % ) reported a sustained level of energy drink consumption for the years studied, reports medical express, and were \" significantly more likely to be using stimulant drugs \" at age 25. Even the 17.4 % whose use was intermittent were more likely to use cocaine and prescription drugs than the 20.6 % who never used energy drinks. By controlling for things like risk-taking behaviors, caffeine consumption, prior substance use, and demographics, researchers say they've singled out energy drinks as the culprit. The findings come right as senate minority leader chuck schumer has called on the fda to investigate coco loko, a caffeinated raw cacao snuff he recently called \" cocaine on training wheels, \" per quartz.

Per the wall street journal, that's the aclu's new official position after last weekend's violence in charlottesville. The new york times notes this is a big philosophical break for the aclu, which has long insisted that protecting the first amendment for all groups, even odious ones, is better for everyone. ( the los angeles times documents how the aclu has struggled with this stance. ) in fact, the group's virginia branch went to court and successfully argued that the \" unite the right \" rally should be held in the charlottesville park organizers had chosen for the event; the city had tried to change the location. The group came under new fire for the move. One member on the virginia branch's board even resigned, tweeting: \" i won't be a fig leaf for nazis. \" aclu executive director anthony romero says the policy has been revamped to align more closely with the organization's decision in 2015 to support \" reasonable \" firearm regulation. \" if a protest group insists, ' no, we want to be able to carry loaded firearms, ' well, we don't have to represent them, \" romero says, per the wsj. \" they can find someone else. \" he adds it's not \" a blanket no or a blanket yes \" overall for hate groups; rather, the aclu will proceed on a case-by-case basis.",

The rally organizer, preston wiginton, told the texas tribune that he might sue and he might seek the a.c.l.u.'s help. Since charlottesville, the a.c.l.u. Has clearly wrestled with what to do when the next case comes along. It indicated on thursday that, in evaluating whether to take free-speech cases involving public gatherings, the group would consider the potential for violence at the event and whether protesters were going to be carrying firearms. But ms. Sullivan, the spokeswoman, said that was not a new policy; rather, it reflected existing practices. \"we make decisions on whom we ' ll represent and in what context on a case-by-case basis, \" the a.c.l.u. Said in a statement on thursday. \"the horrible events in charlottesville last weekend will certainly inform those decisions going forward. \" mr. Romero, the a.c.l.u.'s executive director, said in an interview this week that the group would remain committed to its free speech advocacy. \"this is not a new juncture for the a.c.l.u., \" he said. \"we have a longstanding history of defending the rights of groups we detest and with whom we fundamentally disagree. \" even so, in the first months of the trump presidency",
            "Officials in charlottesville had initially denied organizers of the \" unite the right \" rally a permit to hold the event at the site of a robert e. Lee statue. But the aclu filed a lawsuit defending protesters ' rights to gather there. The rally ended with one woman killed and dozens of people injured as neo-nazis and other far-right groups that had come armed with shields, helmets and even guns clashed violently with counter-protesters.",

        "summary": "New york magazine calls it \" the worst roommate story you ' ll ever read \" — and that's no exaggeration, as many readers of the viral piece have pointed out on twitter. William brennan's harrowing longform on jamison bachman starts with the story of alex miller, a philadelphia woman looking for a roommate via craigslist last march. \" jed creek \" responded to her ad and the 60-year-old seemed like a perfect fit — but, as miller discovered after he started exhibiting bizarre and threatening behavior toward her, \" creek \" was actually bachman, a \" serial squatter \" who used his knowledge of tenancy laws to terrorize roommates, ultimately sending a dozen of them \" into court and often from their home. \" his motivation did not seem to be financial, brennan writes: rather, \" he seemed to relish the anguish of those who had taken him in without realizing that they would soon be pulled into a terrifying battle for their home. \" bachman started by making ever-so-slightly unsettling changes to his roommates ' homes, things like moving furniture or taking lightbulbs from common areas for his own use. Eventually his behavior escalated — he would clog toilets with his cat's litter, refuse to pay rent based on something minor like a messy living room or a cigarette butt in the toilet bowl, threaten legal action, and even sometimes get violent. All the while he would refuse requests to move out, ultimately forcing the roommate to sue him. Brennan's piece delves into bachman's affluent upbringing and how a promising childhood and adolescence devolved into a paranoid young adulthood after he witnessed the murder of a friend in college, a fractured relationship with his family — and from there, the roommate exploits. As the situation between bachman and miller crescendoed, things took a sharp and tragic turn. Brennan's full piece is absolutely worth a read.",

Officials on monday released an addendum to wood's 1981 autopsy that cites unexplained bruises and scratches on wood's face and arms as significant factors that led officials to change her death certificate last year from drowning to \" drowning and other undetermined factors. \" officials were careful about their conclusions because they lacked several pieces of evidence.

The nypd says people should remember \" abc \" for avoid, barricade, confront: getting away from the shooter if you can, barricading yourself in if you can't, and confronting them only a last resort, as set out in a department safety pamphlet. To expand on the \" barricade \" part, reporters were told to get \" as many layers at they can \" between themselves and the gun and were shown a video demonstrating how a typical wooden desk provided no protection against two commonly used handguns, a shotgun, and an ak-47, reports nbc. A filing cabinet, however, withstood fire from everything but the ak-47. The nypd, which suggests workplaces set up \" safe rooms \" with thick walls, says it studied more than 200 events to come up with its survival recommendations, which include setting your phone on silent instead of vibrate when hiding. ( a university of alabama reseacher says his study explains why america leads the world in mass shootings. )",

As such, the mutilation charges against two michigan doctors have been dismissed. Dr. Jumana nagarwala, who allegedly performed the surgery, and dr. Fakhruddin attar, who allegedly allowed his livonia clinic to be used, were defendants in america's first female genital mutilation case, which involves 9 alleged victims. Lawyers for the doctors argued the constitutionality point, and us district judge bernard friedman found \" fgm is a ' local criminal activity ' which, in keeping with long-standing tradition and our federal system of government, is for the states to regulate, not congress. \" the detroit free-press explains the federal law was passed under the commerce clause; friedman determined there was \" nothing commercial or economic \" about the mutilation, while the prosecution argued interstate commerce can be at play, as when parents drive their girls across state lines to undergo the procedure. As for state regulation, 27 states ban it, and michigan is included in that list. But its law was passed subsequent to nagarwala's april 2017 arrest, reports the ap; as such, it can't be applied to the doctors, and so prosecutors were relying on the federal law, which carries a sentence of up to five years. Prosecutors say they will decide whether to appeal the ruling. Nagarwala isn't off the hook, however, and faces conspiracy and obstruction charges that carry a sentence of up to 20 years if she's convicted. The trial is set to begin in april.

The president of the southwestern baptist theological seminary — described as one of the biggest seminaries in the world — no longer has that title, with the seminary's trustees announcing wednesday that after a meeting that the baptist standard reports went until 3am, they decided to \" move in the direction of new leadership. \" but patterson will remain a paid president emeritus and can retire on campus grounds as \" theologian-in-residence, \" per a statement. What got the ball rolling: a tape of a 2000 interview patterson gave that was posted online on april 28 and spurred thousands of southern baptist women to call for his ouster. The washington post reports the board's move will \" likely come as a relief \" to those women. In the tape, patterson recounts counseling a woman whose husband was abusing her to pray for the man. She subsequently returned to him with black eyes. \" she said: ' i hope you're happy. ' and i said ' yes … i ' m very happy, ' \" because her husband had gone to church for the first time in the wake of the beating. Other comments made headlines, with a new story emerging tuesday as the trustees met: the post reported on a woman who says she went to patterson after a 2003 rape and was advised by him not to report it and to forgive her alleged attacker; instead, the woman was placed on two years ' probation by the seminary. The trustees'statement noted \" evidence exists that dr. Patterson has complied with reporting laws regarding assault and abuse. \"",

        "summary": "If new protocols are successfully developed and the change isn't blocked by court challenges, one of oklahoma's 49 condemned inmates will soon become the first person in the us legally executed with nitrogen gas. The state — which started exploring the use of the inert gas after a botched lethal injection in 2014 halted executions — says it has made nitrogen inhalation its primary method of execution and will be using the gas when executions resume, the bbc reports. State attorney general mike hunter announced the change wednesday, saying nitrogen is easy to obtain, causes a painless death, and \" requires no complex medical procedures. \" no other state uses the method. Dale baich, a lawyer for oklahoma inmates challenging execution protocols, called for total transparency from the state. \" this method has never been used before and is experimental, \" he said, per the washington post. \" oklahoma is once again asking us to trust it as officials 'learn-on-the-job'through a new execution procedure. \" nitrogen execution will involve placing a mask over a person's nose and mouth to flood their lungs with nitrogen, causing them to die from lack of oxygen in a death that slate notes could be \" mildly euphoric, \" similar to the \" raptures \" experienced by deep-sea divers low on oxygen.

            "Photo by saul loeb/afp/getty images on wednesday night, the supreme court stopped an execution by lethal injection. The condemned missouri man, russell bucklew, says he has a medical condition, affecting his veins, that would make the injection cause hemorrhaging — and make him feel like he's choking on his own blood. The court took the unusual step of intervening at the last minutes, when every other court had turned bucklew down, and also of sending the case back to the lower courts to decide whether to hold a hearing about bucklew's claim. The supreme court ruled in 2008 that kentucky's three-drug protocol for carrying out lethal injections was constitutional, but there's no question that the method looks grimly suspect in the wake of clayton lockett's apparently painful, botched execution in oklahoma last month. Not so long ago, though, this was the method that represented progress. Hanging. Firing squad. The guillotine. The electric chair. The gas chamber. Lethal injection. Every age seems to feature a new and improved method of capital punishment, billed as more efficient and humane. The spectacle of lockett's death, and the supreme court's hesitation, shines a spotlight on the latest idea — death by nitrogen. As long as there's a will to kill criminals",

            "It would be an attack on the very heart of democracy. Spiegel has learned that terrorists may have been planning an attack on the reichstag, the home of the german parliament and one of the most popular tourist destinations in berlin. Two suspected culprits are already believed to be in berlin. According to information obtained by german security authorities, al-qaida and associated groups are believed to be planning an attack on the reichstag building in berlin, the headquarters of germany's parliament and also an attraction visited by thousands of tourists every day. As part of the attack, terrorists would seek to take hostages and perpetrate a bloodbath using firearms. The information about the alleged plans came from a jihadist who is currently abroad and has reportedly contacted the german federal criminal police office ( bka ) several times in recent days. The jihadist apparently wants to abandon the group. The information provided by the jihadist informant was apparently the reason behind german interior minister thomas de maizière's decision to hold a press conference on wednesday warning of an imminent attack in the country. According to the caller, the terror cell is comprised of six people -- two of whom are believed already to have traveled to berlin six to eight weeks ago, and are now staying in the city. Four other perpetrators -- a german, a turk, a north african and a further man the jihadist could not identify -- are currently waiting to travel to germany. The attacks are purportedly being planned for february or march. Apparent plans for second attack the second warning backing de maizière's concerns came from the united states. The us federal police, the fbi, sent a cable to the bka two weeks ago noting another possible further attack. A shiite-indian group known as the \" saif, \" or sword, is believed to have engaged in a pact with al-qaida and to have sent two men to germany to carry out an attack there. Both were believed to be traveling to the united arab emirates on nov. 22, where they would be supplied with new travel papers so that they could continue on to germany. The suspects allegedly already posess visas for europe's schengen zone of visa-free travel. The fbi has named mushtaq altaf bin-khadri as the man behind the attack plans. The man believed to be trying to smuggle the would-be terrorists into europe is 54-year-old weapons dealer dawood ibrahim, who the united nations believes is a major backer of terrorism."

            "It would be an attack on the very heart of democracy. Spiegel has learned that terrorists may have been planning an attack on the reichstag, the home of the german parliament and one of the most popular tourist destinations in berlin. Two suspected culprits are already believed to be in berlin. According to information obtained by german security authorities, al-qaida and associated groups are believed to be planning an attack on the reichstag building in berlin, the headquarters of germany's parliament and also an attraction visited by thousands of tourists every day. As part of the attack, terrorists would seek to take hostages and perpetrate a bloodbath using firearms. The information about the alleged plans came from a jihadist who is currently abroad and has reportedly contacted the german federal criminal police office ( bka ) several times in recent days. The jihadist apparently wants to abandon the group. The information provided by the jihadist informant was apparently the reason behind german interior minister thomas de maizière's decision to hold a press conference on wednesday warning of an imminent attack in the country. According to the caller, the terror cell is comprised of six people -- two of whom are believed already to have traveled to berlin six to eight weeks ago, and are now staying in the city. Four other perpetrators -- a german, a turk, a north african and a further man the jihadist could not identify -- are currently waiting to travel to germany. The attacks are purportedly being planned for february or march. Apparent plans for second attack the second warning backing de maizière's concerns came from the united states. The us federal police, the fbi, sent a cable to the bka two weeks ago noting another possible further attack. A shiite-indian group known as the \" saif, \" or sword, is believed to have engaged in a pact with al-qaida and to have sent two men to germany to carry out an attack there. Both were believed to be traveling to the united arab emirates on nov. 22, where they would be supplied with new travel papers so that they could continue on to germany. The suspects allegedly already posess visas for europe's schengen zone of visa-free travel. The fbi has named mushtaq altaf bin-khadri as the man behind the attack plans. The man believed to be trying to smuggle the would-be terrorists into europe is 54-year-old weapons dealer dawood ibrahim, who the united nations believes is a major backer of terrorism."

        "summary": "Calling sexual orientation \" one of the many natural phenomena, \" the chief justice of india's supreme court made a big announcement thursday about one of the nation's colonial-era laws. The guardian reports india's highest court has struck down a 160-year-old law banning consensual gay sex, with another justice noting that \" history owes an apology to members of the [ gay ] community for the delay in ensuring their rights \" by keeping section 377 on the books. The ruling follows nearly 25 years of waffling by india's judicial system on the issue, including the striking down of the law in 2009, followed by an overturning of that decision four years later by the supreme court. They found the law's incredibly infrequent use meant it wasn't violating citizens ' constitutional rights; a separate 2017 privacy ruling caused the justices to reconsider the decision. Lgbt advocates say not many have been prosecuted under the law — which the new york times characterizes as \" one of the world's oldest bans on consensual gay sex \" — but that gays and lesbians face constant discrimination and can even be discouraged from seeking treatment for hiv because of it. The ruling is also a rebuke of british colonial rule in the 1860s, when the law was spurred by victorian-era mores. The co-author of a homophobia report tells cnn 30 of nearly 50 former british colonies still have the colonial-era anti-lgbt laws on the books; al jazeera notes nearby pakistan, sri lanka, and bangladesh still consider homosexuality illegal. \" we have thrown out the british once again, \" one activist says, per the guardian.",

Simon constable talks to josh barbanel. One broker familiar with the transaction said the final price was about $ 11.5 million. Mr. Limbaugh paid just under $ 5 million for the apartment as well as a maid's room and a storage locker, in 1994.

Mr. Limbaugh's 10-room condominium, which features a 30-foot-wide living room with fireplace and four terraces overlooking central park at east 86th street, went into contract thursday for a bit under the final $ 12.95 million asking price, brokers said. Enlarge image close corcoran a mural decorates a bedroom ceiling in the condominium just sold by rush limbaugh. A year after railing about the high tax burden on wealthy new yorkers, rush limbaugh, the conservative radio talk-show host, is severing one more tie with new york, selling his lushly decorated fifth avenue penthouse to an undisclosed buyer and reaping millions in profit as a result. Simon constable talks to josh barbanel. One broker familiar with the transaction said the final price was about $ 11.5 million. Mr. Limbaugh paid just under $ 5 million for the apartment as well as a maid's room and a storage locker, in 1994. At that price, city officials said that the sale would usually trigger a payment from the seller at the closing of about $ 325,000 in transfer taxes, including about $ 164,000 for new york city and $ 161,000 for new york state to help close the state's huge budget deficit. Last year when new york state adopted a temporary income-tax surcharge to raise more than $ 3 billion a year, mr. Limbaugh said on his radio show that he was going to \" get out of new york totally \" and sell his manhattan apartment. A web transcript of the show is titled \" el rushbo to new york: drop dead. \" mr. Limbaugh didn't return a call for comment. On the radio last week, he railed again against high property taxes, and predicted that basketball star lebron james would bypass new york, and join a team in a place like miami to save $ 12 million to $ 20 million a year in state income taxes he might have to pay in new york.

The queen biopic, led by rami malek as freddy mercury, is a letdown for some critics, while others wonder if director bryan singer's sudden exit before the film's completion took a toll. Four views: leah greenblatt at entertainment weekly writes that the film \" has the distinct whiff of compromise and art by committee. \" luckily, it has \" an utterly unconventional star \" in malek, who \" has the ineffable pixie dust the part requires. \" while there's an \" unfortunate silliness … in the script's training-wheels approach to storytelling, \" malek is \" entrancing from the moment he steps on screen, \" greenblatt writes.

Per wtvc, police who arrived at the east ridge home where the crime took place ( lawhorn called 911 before fleeing ) found two bodies, later identified as gaines and lawhorn's mother. \" she started screaming the worst scream i've ever heard, \" lawhorn wrote in the post about shooting his mom. \" movies really don't do justice to how true terror sounds. \" east ridge police assistant chief stan allen tells abc news the facebook post — part of which can be seen in a twitter screenshot via the jasper county news — appears to be authentic, as details sync up to what cops found at the crime scene. By 7pm sunday, police in jasper county, miss., say they'd found the 2002 ford taurus that lawhorn was driving abandoned on i59 near the vossburg exit, and they're warning locals lawhorn is \" armed \" and \" very dangerous. \" in the post, lawhorn says he was having issues at college and was suicidal, and he implored anyone reading it to look after his younger brother. He says his car broke down on the i59, after which he apparently made the facebook post. \" what i look forward to is the nothingness after death, \" he wrote. \" i've spent a lot of time thinking about murder, wondering what it feels like. But i've barely felt anything. \"",

        "summary": "\" who knows if it is the real ax? \" says leon trotsky's grandson, esteban volkov, dismissively to the guardian. Keith melton, for one. The private collector says he staunchly believes that an ice pick he recently purchased and plans to display at the international spy museum in washington is the one that ended up two-inches-deep into trotsky's head on aug. 20, 1940. The russian revolutionary was dead a day later. The guardian traces the murky path the ax took after it was wielded by a man who went by frank jacson ( in reality spanish communist ramón mercader ) and visited trotsky at his mexico city-area home under the guise of wanting his feedback on an article. It was briefly shown to the public at a police press conference, then stored as evidence until police officer alfredo salas took it. He gave it to daughter ana alicia, who kept it under her bed for decades and then tried to sell it in 2005, telling the guardian at the time that she was \" looking for some financial benefit. \" as for what the financial benefit ended up being, melton wouldn't say and salas wouldn't even confirm the sale occurred. As for how melton knows it's the genuine article, he cites things ranging from a paper trail to a telltale rust mark that he says was born from a bloody fingerprint left by jacson. The ap does a deep dive into melton, who lives in boca raton, florida, and once claimed the title of largest mcdonald's franchisee in america. His collection of spy artifacts, thought to be the largest in the world, is worth an estimated $ 20 million. It was boxed up over 17 days and shipped to the museum, which is opening a new facility next year. Read more on melton's other treasures here.",

            "The united kingdom parliament will debate banning gop presidential candidate donald trump from the country later this month. Ministers will consider whether or not to prohibit trump from entering the country jan. 18 after a petition to parliament calling for a ban gained more than half a million signatures. \"the uk has banned entry to many individuals for hate speech, \" the petition reads. \"if the united kingdom is to continue applying the 'unacceptable behaviour ' criteria to those who wish to enter its borders, it must be fairly applied to the rich as well as poor, and the weak as well as powerful. \" suzanne kelly, the freelance journalist who began the petition, welcomed the news. \"however the debate goes, this exercise has brought many people together to speak out against hate speech and prejudice, \" she said in a statement. \"that is my reward, and one i ' m very happy",

        "summary": "Applying deodorant or antiperspirant clearly alters your body's smell, but it may also alter your body's bacteria. A peerj study finds the organisms that live in and on your skin are drastically changed by what you put under your arms. Evolutionary genomicist julie horvath recruited 17 participants — antiperspirant users, deodorant users, and those who went au naturel — and swabbed their armpits twice a day for eight days, report quartz and the washington post. On the first day, researchers found deodorant users had more microbes than those who didn't use any products. Participants who used antiperspirant, which blocks sweat glands, had hardly any. Most surprising, however, was that the armpits of the three groups remained strikingly different after all participants went product-free for five days. The control group's armpits contained 62 % corynebacteria ( body odor bacteria ), 21 % staphylococcaceae bacteria, and 17 % \" other \" bacteria. The armpits of antiperspirant users contained 60 % staphylococcaceae, 14 % corynebacteria, and 20 % other bacteria, while deodorant users armpits held 61 % staphylococcaceae, 29 % corynebacterium, and 10 % other microbes. \" using antiperspirant and deodorant completely rearranges the microbial ecosystem of your skin — what's living on us and in what amounts, \" horvath tells medical daily, adding \" we have no idea what effect, if any, that has on our skin and on our health. \" more work is needed to understand the differences, but experts speculate that antiperspirant kills off typical armpit microbes, allowing less common bacteria to propagate. Horvath now plans to compare the results to a study of microbes in earwax. ( here's why pits are so stinky. )",

In an opinion article published yesterday in a local newspaper, the patriot-news, the four council members who voted for bankruptcy said assured guaranty and bondholders should forgive at least $ 100 million of the debt. They also said there should be a countywide sales tax of 1 percent to help pay off the debt. Schwartz, in the interview, said that could forestall asset sales. Assets",

Quentin tarantino employed the controversial term in the context of discussing his film, django unchained, for which the writer/director won best screenplay. The movie, which employs the slur over and over again in the course of its 165 minutes, has struck controversy in the african american community for its portrayal of a slave-turned-bounty hunter in antebellum mississippi.

        "summary": "If you're wondering where president trump sits on the question of whether america's confederate statues should be taken down, wonder no more. Trump earlier addressed the topic in his tuesday press conference, and returned to it thursday morning in a three-part tweet. He writes, \" sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... /... Can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert e lee, stonewall jackson - who's next, washington, jefferson? so foolish! also... /... The beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! \" reaction and more on the subject: maine gov. Paul lepage offered comments that aligned with trump's in a thursday interview with wgan-am. The ap has his comments: \" how can future generations learn if we're going to erase history? that's disgusting.... Listen, whether we like it or not, this is what our history is. To me, it's just like going to new york city right now and taking down the monument of those who perished in 9/11. It will come to that. \" lexington herald-leader columnist tom eblen formerly ascribed to \" learn from history \" thinking, having advocated to keep the city's two confederate statues outside its old courthouse and just add signs giving context. He explained his change of heart on tuesday: \" defenders of confederate memorials like to argue that moving or removing them amounts to rewriting history, but they are wrong. Fact is, these monuments were themselves attempts to rewrite history, to make racism honorable and disguise white supremacy as'southern heritage. ' \" so how many of these statues have been removed? \" only a tiny fraction, \" per fivethirtyeight, which cites data from the southern poverty law center that shows there are more than 700 public confederate monuments standing. Most were constructed in the 20th century, and as recently as 2012. Trump called them \" beautiful \"; foreign policy doesn't use as flattering a word in a piece that looks at how post-nazi germany and post-soviet eastern europe dealt with their \" heinous \" statues, specifically zeroing in on a huge statue of stalin in budapest and hitler's zeppelin field grandstand in nuremberg. Soledad o ' brien tweeted a photo of one of the \" beautiful \" statues trump was referencing, with a call to read its inscription. In part: \" united states troops...

Employers added 171,000 people to their payrolls last month, the labor department said on friday. The government also said 84,000 more jobs were created in august and september than previously estimated. The jobless rate edged up a tenth of a point to 7.9 percent, but that was due to workers surging back into the",

        "summary": "Soon, you may be able to enjoy an ice cream cone without having to worry about sticky fingers. Scientists from the university of edinburgh and the university of dundee have discovered that a naturally occurring protein, known as bsla, can be used to make melt-resistant ice cream, abc news reports. Bsla ( or bacterial surface layer a, as upi notes ), which is already used in some asian dishes, is created by microbial communities as they seek to protect themselves; it \" goes to the outer surface of this community and makes a film that we dubbed a bacterial raincoat — it becomes basically water repellent, \" research leader cait macphee tells cbs news. The protein adheres to air bubbles and droplets of fat, stabilizing them, and in the process protecting the microbial community: \" if there are any other bugs in the environment that want to attack our friendly bacteria, they can't get through because they bounce off, \" macphee says. And then there's the ice cream-related side effect. Since the protein can protect and bind ice cream's three main ingredients ( air, fat, and ice ), \" you should be able to eat an ice cream cone without the ice cream dribbling down the side \" if it's used to make the frosty treat, says macphee, though, as the washington post notes, the ice cream does still get warm eventually. The team tested out the theory, replacing the emulsifier in a vanilla ice cream recipe with the protein, and found the resulting dessert did in fact melt more slowly. And, as the scientists note in a press release, there's an added bonus: \" the protein binds together the air, fat, and water in ice cream, creating a super-smooth consistency \" — which also means there won't be as many ice crystals formed in your ice cream if you leave it in the freezer too long. As for whether it's any good, the team didn't actually eat the creation — but since such a small amount of the protein is used, they don't think there will be any impact on the taste. When can you buy it? researchers estimate it could be on sale within three to five years. ( click to see why ice cream parlors were once considered evil. )",

But now a team of astronomers at harvard is suggesting we also look for gases not generated by biological processes — read: industrial air pollution. The james webb space telescope, launching in 2018, could detect pollutants like chlorofluorocarbons ( used in air conditioning and refrigerators ) so long as they exist on a planet near a white dwarf ( the remains of a sun-like star ) because light from a burning sun would interfere with the ability to see the chemicals, reports livescience. Greenhouse gases could even be a sign of primitive life. \" we consider industrial pollution as a sign of intelligent life, but perhaps civilizations more advanced than us... Will consider pollution as a sign of unintelligent life since it's not smart to contaminate your own air, \" the study leader says in a statement. If we detect such chemicals, they could potentially lead to dead civilizations — or ones that found a way to use greenhouse gases for warmth, says avi loeb, chair of harvard's astrophysics department and a co-author of the paper. Loeb tells time he's surprised that no one has yet thought to look for industrial air pollution. Finding it may be a long shot, but as physicists have said about looking for alien radio signals, \" if we never search, the chance of success is zero. \" ( meanwhile, extraterrestrial life may be closer to home than we think. )",

        "summary": "Helicopter parenting usually gets a bad rap, and this is no exception. A recent study suggests that children who are more controlled by mothers will end up struggling with their emotions, impulses, and schoolwork later on, the guardian reports. Published in developmental psychology, the study followed 422 children over an 8-year stretch. Researchers found that controlled playtime at age 2 often corresponded with less mental and emotional control at age 5, per a press release, while less-dominated kids often developed stronger impulse control and fared better over time. \" children who developed the ability to effectively calm themselves during distressing situations... Had an easier time adjusting to the increasingly difficult demands of preadolescent school environments, \" says study co-author nicole perry. The study began with mothers and their 2-year-olds having playtime in a laboratory, the cbc reports. Some moms instinctively told their kids which toy to use, how to use it, and how to tidy up when finished — at times sparking the child's frustration or defiance. Those children tended to have less self-control at age 5 when denied candy or given a set time to solve a puzzle. At age 10, they and their teachers were quizzed on topics ranging from depression to academic performance, and negative answers tended to correspond with tighter parenting. \" the problem here really is that if you don't learn skills to self-regulate, how can you self-regulate when you leave the home, \" says a professor who mostly liked the study. \" in a way it is a form of abusiveness — taking this opportunity away from children. \" ( a mother who let her son play 120 feet away faced up to six months in jail. )",

Calling the report an \" attack, \" the fox news personality sought to deny any wrongdoing after it was revealed that he's the owner behind a string of shell companies that have purchased at least $ 90 million worth of mostly foreclosed properties dating back to the obama administration. \"it is ironic that i am being attacked for investing my personal money in communities that badly need such investment and in which, i am sure, those attacking me have not invested their money, \" the 56-year-old said in a statement on his website monday. Hannity's investments were reported by the guardian after it was recently revealed that he was a client of president trump's personal attorney michael cohen. The companies purchased the properties with support from the department of housing and urban development; as mediaite points out, the hud program that made such support possible was created under president obama. However, the guardian reports that the maximum loan amount that can be insured through the program was increased under trump's hud secretary, ben carson. The guardian also points out that hannity could be seen \"praising \" carson on his show without disclosing any potential conflict of interest. It is on these points that hannity has cried foul. \" i have never discussed with anybody at hud the original loans that were obtained in the obama years, nor the subsequent refinance of such loans, as they are a private matter, \" hannity said monday. \" i had no role in, or responsibility for, any hud involvement in any of these investments. \"",

Fishing pro mike borger says it started with a video he posted earlier this year about a trip to a lake in algonquin park, an ontario provincial park bigger than delaware, with more than 2,400 lakes. Borger says he politely declined requests to reveal the location of his brook trout fishing spot, which he has been returning to for 15 years. But later on, he says, somebody filed a freedom of information request with the provincial ministry of natural resources and forestry in a bid to discover where he'd been fishing. \" i ' m going to give him credit, because it was an incredibly smart — underhanded and a little bit devious — but also very smart way to get this information, \" borger tells the cbc. \" if somebody has a copy of my interior camping permit, which shows which lakes i camped on each night, they can clearly and easily figure out which lake i caught these trophy fish in. \" borger says the ministry told him about the request. After he raised concerns, the ministry told him it would not confirm or deny the existence of the records to the person seeking it, though the person will have the option of appealing the decision. It shows the \" lengths some people will apparently go to find your fishing spot, \" borger says.",

So if you're confused by a newly announced warner bros. Film adaptation of the book that swaps boys for girls, well, you're not alone. More on the film, to be written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel: a modern take: siegel tells deadline it will be \" a very faithful but contemporized adaptation of the book, \" which he refers to as \" a timeless story that is especially relevant today, with the interpersonal conflicts and bullying. \" two previous film adaptations were released in 1963 and 1990. So why the change? a female cast \" might help people see the story anew, \" mcgehee says. At the same time, \" it breaks away from some of the conventions, the ways we think of boys and aggression. \" isn't that the point? this tweet from roxane gay sums up one view: \" an all women remake of lord of the flies makes no sense because... The plot of that book wouldn't happen with all women. \" criticism of another kind: the new york times reports part of the \" immediate scrutiny on social media \" has to do with the fact that the film will be written and directed by two men. Cnn rounds up tweets following this line. Questioning motives: at the daily caller, jena greene speculates about what movie bosses were thinking: \" that it would be fun to watch girls for an hour and a half in limited clothing on an island. \" would golding approve? maybe not. In a 1993 interview cited by the times, the late author had this to say about the story being written about boys: \" if you land with a group of little boys, they are more like scaled-down society than a group of little girls would be. Don't ask me why, and this is a terrible thing to say, because i ' m going to be chased from hell to breakfast by all the women who talk about equality. This has nothing to do with equality at all. \" also in the works: the hollywood reporter notes that this remake isn't an anomaly and lists a number of others where the men will be replaced by women, including a rocketeer movie, ocean's eleven spin-off ocean's eight, a dirty rotten scoundrels remake called nasty women, and a splash",

        "summary": "California doesn't have enough water and alaska has plenty. Which is why, starting this summer, a company in southeast alaska plans to begin shipping 10 million gallons a month to customers in the parched state, reports alaska dispatch news. It's not clear who those customers are, but alaska bulk water ceo terry trapp says the contracts are in place. The sitka company, which used to be in the bottled-water business, is still working out the logistics of storage and shipping, but it's already thinking beyond california. \"the company has been in discussion with many of the water-stressed countries around the world and expects to begin international shipments in the near future as well, \" says trapp. Adn notes that former alaska gov. Wally hickel proposed the idea of shipping water to california decades ago via pipeline, but it was seen as too far-fetched. A recent post at wired re-examined the pipeline idea and concluded that it's \" still crazy \" and would be too expensive to pull off. The bulk water shipments are an alternative to that. The water would come from 6-mile-long blue lake, and adn's description is sure to make californians jealous: \" the water is so abundant that household use is not metered, and so ' clean in its natural state'that filtration is not required, \" it says, citing sitka's public works department.",

The baby, who was examined at the hospital, wasn't injured, but prosecutors say a probe found vazquez-hernandez had allegedly poured \" approximately one inch of nail polish remover [ into ] the baby bottle. \" cops say she told them she wanted to \" punish \" her husband and the baby's mother, and she reportedly was in a physical altercation with her husband a month before the alleged milk poisoning, which prosecutors plan to enter as evidence of the strain on the relationship.

Today, the new york post jumps into the fray, with a report that lauer is the first choice to take over for alex trebek as jeopardy host in 2016. Lauer's today contract is up in 2015, and trebek is expected to step down the following year.

In this flick, bourne is bent on discovering the story behind his initial recruitment. Critics are mostly split. Here's what they're saying: \" jason bourne is more than a just worthy addition to a popular franchise — it's the cherry on the top \" and \" the best the series has yet offered, \" writes james berardinelli at reelviews. It has the same format as its predecessors but \" a relentless intensity \" that's unmatched. In fact, \" when it comes to keeping audiences uncertain and white-knuckled, the movie rarely lets up. Prepare to be exhausted \" when the credits roll. \" jason bourne largely sticks to the franchise's familiar moves, and they often don't have the same kinetic finesse they used to, \" writes jake coyle at the ap. Yet it still \" has a weight that outclasses nearly every other big action movie around. \" it's too bad damon speaks only a handful of times, but the \" steely but agile presence \" of alicia vikander as the cia's cyber ops head \" brightens the film's dour gaze. \" mick lasalle, however, says the flick was \" a chore to sit through. \" the shaky camerawork is \" silly, \" \" the character motivations are weak, and the story is poorly structured, \" he writes at the san francisco chronicle. Plus there's little suspense and no relationships to care about. \" it's the opposite of exciting. It's the visual equivalent of white noise, and if you're not careful, you might fall asleep. \" it's \" handsomely filmed \" and \" well-acted, \" writes moira macdonald at the seattle times. But the film misses an opportunity to return bourne to the life he once lived. \" it's a jittery flash-connect of motorcycle chases, car crashes … and screenshots of files downloading while ominous music plays, \" she says. It \" gets lost in its focus on flash and speed, and forgets about the man — and the fine, quiet actor — at its center. \"",
