It represents an essential part of our character -- curiosity and exploration, innovation and ingenuity, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and doing it before anybody else. The space race we won not only contributed immeasurably important technological and medical advances, but it also inspired a new generation of scientists and engineers with the right stuff to keep america on the cutting edge.

            "According to tv one ( a cable network focused on programming for black adults ), blacks make up nearly a third of the nation's missing-person cases, a number demographically out of proportion. But \"find our missing's \" main mission isn't media criticism or a social harangue — especially since the first two cases seen here received a considerable, if belated, amount of local coverage. Rather, in the manner of \"america's most wanted, \" it encourages viewers to come forward with useful information. Everything you need to know about \"find our missing \" is in that second word: our. The series keeps its outrage just out of view; its foremost concern is for the missing, as well as their friends and relatives. Hosted by \"law &amp; order \" alum s. Epatha merkerson, \"find our missing's \" first case should be familiar to washington post readers: it follows the february 2009 disappearance of pamela butler, a 47-year-old federal employee who was last seen in her brightwood home in northeast washington.

        "summary": "It turns out getting in the holiday spirit can be good for your mental health. A study published last week in clinical psychological science found performing small acts of kindness for others can give us an improved outlook on things and help us to better deal with stress. \" stressful days usually lead us to have a worse mood and poorer mental health, but our findings suggest that if we do small things for others, such as holding a door open for someone, we won't feel as poorly on stressful days, \" researcher emily ansell says in an association for psychological science press release. The findings suggest \" prosocial behavior \" might someday be a useful course of treatment for people suffering from chronic stress or depression. Previous lab-based studies have shown similar results, but ansell and her team wanted to see if they held true in the real world, cbs news reports. According to the press release, researchers had 77 adults use their smartphones to report stressful events, acts of kindness, and their emotional state every day for two weeks. Cbs reports participants averaged one or two helpful acts per day. But those who logged more than that had improved well-being and were less affected by stress. \" the holiday season can be a very stressful time, so think about giving directions, asking someone if they need help, or holding that elevator door over the next month, \" ansell says in the press release. \" it may end up helping you feel just a little bit better. \" ( a cafe's act of kindness for grieving parents went viral. )",

Ferguson then draws a gun and fires a single shot, reportedly into the ground. Nobody was injured. Christian — who accuses ferguson of assault, false imprisonment, and causing emotional distress — was one of two teens later arrested on suspicion of battery, but protesters have demanded \" justice \" since ferguson remains on duty while police investigate, per the oc register.

Attendees of the grand opening party ( \" fashion influencers \" invited by palessi, er, payless ) had no idea things were not as they seemed, and yes, $ 640 was the top price paid for the $ 19.99 and $ 39.99 shoes on display, adweek reports. A whopping $ 3,000 was spent in just a few hours on the actually cheap shoes, but payless returned the money after the truth was revealed — and let the attendees keep the shoes they picked out. The shocked reactions of people who just found out the shoes they were calling \" elegant \" and \" sophisticated \" were actually from payless are included in the resulting ads. The stunt \" helped the brand prove that a price point doesn't dictate style, \" bustle declares. But one marketing expert notes the whole thing is also \" a commentary...

        "summary": "Think it's ok to take a week off from working out? think again... If you even can. A study published last month in frontiers in aging neuroscience finds the benefits of exercise on the brain can fade after just 10 days. Previous studies have shown that exercise increases blood flow to the brain, which can create new neurons, increase volume in important places, and possibly even improve memory and thought, the new york times reports. But it was unclear how long that healthy increased blood flow and its benefits would last. Now we know: less than 10 days. Researchers looked at a dozen \" exceedingly fit \" seniors — ages 50 to 80 — who still ran 35 or more miles per week. After 10 days of doing nothing, the seniors had less blood flow to eight regions of their brain, including significantly less to the hippocampus, which is associated with memory, medical news today reports. Medical daily quotes the study's lead author, dr. J. Carson smith, who says the hippocampus is \" one of the first brain regions to shrink in people with alzheimer's disease. \" the seniors didn't perform any worse on cognitive tests after 10 days of loafing about, and more research is needed to see if a cessation of exercise actually impacts the functioning of the brain. In the meantime, keep on that workout schedule. ( eleven hours of this brain game can cut dementia risk in half. )",

        "summary": "For years, guidelines regarding mammograms have been, well, all over the place. The us preventive services task force recommends women get a mammogram every two years starting at age 50. Since 2003, the american cancer society has recommended annual mammograms starting at age 40. The society's first mammogram guideline revisions in more than a decade are only complicating matters. A breakdown, per nbc news and cnn: women with an average risk of breast cancer should have a mammogram every year from age 45 to 54. If a woman wants one sooner, she should be able to start at age 40, as long as she understands false positives are more common at this age. Women over 55 years can continue annual screenings or choose to have a mammogram every two years since breast cancers develop more slowly in post-menopausal women. This is part of what an acs doctor calls \" a personalized approach, \" per time. Keep up with annual or biennial screenings while you remain in good health and have a life expectancy of at least 10 years. Average-risk women can opt out of routine breast checks altogether. Why fewer checks? the society's chief medical officer tells cnn that mammograms aren't always beneficial, and the stress of the procedures, plus misdiagnoses, actually cause harm. If a woman \" starts screening at age 40, she increases the risk that she ' ll need a breast cancer biopsy that turns out with the doctor saying ' you don't have cancer, so sorry we put you through all this, ' \" he says. Critics, however, say the new guidelines are dangerous since experts only examined whether screening saved a woman's life, rather than led to an early diagnosis. Confused? this won't help: the american college of radiology and the society of breast imaging \" continue to recommend that women get yearly mammograms starting at age 40, \" according to a release.",

A rhino with the teeth of a rodent and head of a hippo? no problem, scientists say, after apparently figuring out, finally, where these mystery creatures sit on the mammalian family tree, nature reports. Charles darwin discovered fossils of these ancient creatures while visiting south america in the 1830s, but failed to classify them ( and called the rhino-like animal \" perhaps one of the strangest \" ever discovered ). Scientists continued to have no luck placing the mammals — which flourished for 60 million years and vanished around 10,000bc — in part because the fossils'dna degraded too fast in the warm climate of south america. Now two british researchers have taken a different route, by extracting collagen protein from the fossils. \" compared to dna, there's absolutely tons of it, \" says one of the scientists, ian barnes. First they created a \" collagen family tree, \" using the protein to figure out other animals ' familial relationships. Then they sequenced collagen from specimens of the rhino-ish toxodon and camel-like macrauchenia sitting in argentinian museums. Turns out the hoofed mammals that baffled darwin are part of the perissodactyla group, which includes rhinos, tapirs, and horses, the researchers say. So why care, unless you're a darwin enthusiast? because this method can be used to analyze other creatures going back millions of years — much further than dna. \" dna sequencing is changing, but protein sequencing is undergoing a similar revolution in the sensitivity of the instruments, \" barnes tells national geographic. \" who's to say what we can do? \" ( a fascist warrior-poet's dna was recently reconstructed with help from a \" love hanky. \" )",

There are conflicting reports on who the airport gunmen are and whether they have actually taken control of the airports. At the airport in simferopol, the crimean capital, dozens of gunmen in unmarked military uniforms have been seen patrolling the area. \" we are checking to make sure that no radicals come to crimea from kiev, from the ukraine, \" one gunman told reporters. Flights there appear to be operating normally, cnn finds, but the wall street journal reports that the other airport, sevastopol's belbek airport, has been closed. Ukraine's interior minister blames russian military units, calling this \" a military invasion and occupation, \" the ap reports. More from ukraine: ethnic russians are a majority in the ukrainian region, which is home to russia's black sea fleet, and the us has told russia to show it is sincere about its promise not to intervene militarily, reuters reports. \" we believe that everybody now needs to take a step back and avoid any kind of provocations, \" john kerry said. Ukraine's parliament also passed a resolution today demanding russia cease any activity that could be considered an attack, cnn reports. Ousted ukrainian leader viktor yanukovich, meanwhile, has surfaced in russia, still proclaiming himself to be ukraine's legitimate president. At a press conference today held in a russian city near the ukraine border, he insisted he was \" not overthrown \" but was forced to flee ukraine in fear for his life, the bbc reports. He called the current parliament \" illegitimate \" and promised to continue fighting \" against terror and fear. \" in simferopol, it's not clear whether gunmen are still in control of the regional parliament building, though what the new york times calls a \" well-orchestrated power grab by pro-russian forces \" appears to have taken place across the city. Legislators held a session after the building was occupied and voted to hold a referendum this may that will decide whether to declare crimea sovereign. Cnn says the government buildings in simferopol were still \" under siege \" today.",

Republicans in the senate are hoping to pass their tax cut legislation this week. &#124; chip somodevilla/getty images senate gop gets breathing room as tax plan advances republican senators were scrambling to negotiate changes to the tax legislation ahead of key committee and floor votes later this week. Senate republicans got some sorely needed momentum behind their tax overhaul tuesday as key gop swing votes inched closer to backing the legislation — after senate leaders launched a frenzied round of negotiations to convince the holdouts. The senate budget committee voted to advance the gop tax reform bill on tuesday on a party-line vote, with both sens. Bob corker ( r-tenn. ) and ron johnson ( r-wis. ) backing the measure a day after threatening to withhold their support. That critical vote came after president donald trump came to capitol hill to rally the troops in the tax battle. Story continued below johnson voted for the tax bill after a back-and-forth with trump during the lunch, according to multiple sources, over the wisconsin republican's main concern: that the current proposal gives more benefits to corporations than to businesses that pay taxes through the individual system. At one point, johnson — who has persistently pressed his case for so-called pass-throughs to other senators — said jokingly that no one grandstands better than him"

The heat, winds, and low humidity increase risk of fire, and much of colorado has been under a red flag fire warning. Forecasters predict temperatures will drop to the low 80s by saturday, which should bring relief. Meanwhile, much of the central and eastern us can expect to bake through the weekend, reports usa today. Heat advisories, watches, and warnings were in effect for 18 states, and cities such as chicago, st. Louis, and detroit will likely open emergency cooling stations. The northeast can expect to break some heat records of its own. ( the people of nawabshah, pakistan might not be impressed by denver's record. )",

        "summary": "With its exceedingly deadly venom unchanged over the past 10 million years, the australian tiger snake has essentially defeated evolution. Researcher bryan fry says in a press release it's \" really unusual \" for venom to remain unchanged over such a long period of time. Typically, predators and prey evolve as they find solutions to each other's evolutionary changes, gizmodo reports. Not so with the tiger snake, which fry says represents \" a novel twist to the chemical arms race which most snake venoms evolve under \" and \" a new addition to the theory of venom evolution. \" a study published in the current edition of comparative biochemistry and physiology part c explains why. Tiger snake venom targets a protein called prothrombin, which handles heavy blood clotting. The venom's effect on prothrombin is what makes it so deadly, which means animals should be under a lot of evolutionary pressure to adjust. However, prothrombin is so important in its current form that any possible mutations to it are just as deadly. As fry explains, animals with a prothrombin mutation \" would not be able to stop bleeding. \" all of which is a long way of saying tiger snakes \" hit the jackpot \" with their venom. Surprisingly, tiger snake venom does possess one benefit to humans: antivenom developed to combat it is effective against an unusually wide range of venomous snake bites.

        "summary": "Police are looking for two men spotted installing a credit card skimmer on a point-of-sale system at a miami beach gas station on wednesday. As a digg post observes, the ease of the whole operation is \" frankly terrifying. \" a surveillance video shows two men approach the counter of a chevron around 9: 30pm, reports cbs miami. While one man asks the attendant to grab some items from behind the counter, a second man pulls a device from his bag and places it over the station's payment terminal. He backs away as another customer approaches, then adjusts the device. The entire installation took less than three seconds. The pair then left the store. Only when the skimmer came loose the next day did a gas station employee realize what had happened and call police. As the men weren't able to return to collect the device — which nabs debit or credit card information when a card is swiped — customers are in luck. But similar devices may go undiscovered at similar high-traffic areas. Your safest bet is to use atms inside a bank, though credit cards are safer than debit cards elsewhere since they have better fraud protections, advises credit.com. ( you might want to consider freezing your credit reports, too. )",

Scientists in london and switzerland gave goats what they called a \" complex foraging task, \" per their paper published in frontiers in zoology: first, the animals had to pull on a rope to get at a lever. Next, they had to lift that lever to get a fruity snack, the smithsonian reports. Nine of 12 goats tested were able to learn to do so within four tries. Two others tried to cheat using their horns, while one poor sap simply couldn't figure it out after 22 tries. Ten months later, the nine champs were given the task again. Seems they hadn't forgotten what they'd learned: they all got to the fruit within about a minute. \" our results challenge the common misconception that goats aren't intelligent animals; they have the ability to learn complex tasks and remember them for a long time, \" says the study's co-author. \" this could explain why they are so successful in colonizing new environments, though we would need to perform a similar study with wild goats to be sure. \" speaking of goat smarts, smithsonian notes that some goats in morocco are known to climb trees, and they're not the only animal to surprisingly do so.",

The brooklyn man managed to fly from cleveland to new york's laguardia airport yesterday on a 76-seat plane that carried just two passengers. Initially, he was the only one. As o ' leary explains to abc news, he was originally booked on a 7: 15am delta flight that ended up being canceled. The brew york editor was placed on a 9: 39am flight that was continually delayed, and instead of waiting it out at the airport, he remained at his hotel. He arrived at the airport to discover that everyone else had been moved to earlier flights; though delta tried to page him to make the same arrangements for him, he wasn't there to hear them. ( as the new york daily news notes, he spent the passing hours lightly grumbling: \" i ' m sure @delta's doing all they can, but this still sucks. \" ) that attitude changed once he boarded: he tweeted that he \" got a personal safety briefing from my two flight attendants, \" along with a grinning photo of himself on the otherwise empty plane. He ultimately had to share: \" the thrill is gone, you guys. Just as we were about to push back, they reconnected the jet bridge to let a second passenger on the flight, \" he tweeted, complete with crying emoji. But o ' leary is finding his story has legs, quipping, \" friends saying that these are my 15 minutes of fame must have forgotten about my cable-access cooking show in 7th grade. \" ( his mom is apparently just glad he recently got a haircut. ) abc confirmed there were only two passengers aboard and suggests delta didn't ax the nearly empty flight because the plane may have been needed in new york for a subsequent flight.

He may also look at how it pays taxes. After the axios story was published wednesday, amazon stock dropped 6.4 % and lost $ 46.6 billion in value, the los angeles times. According to cnbc, it later rebounded a bit — down 4.6 % and more than $ 33 billion — as of this story's publishing. On the other hand, sources say trump never mentions mark zuckerberg or facebook and hasn't been following the cambridge analytica scandal. \" he doesn't mind facebook because it helps him reach his audience, \" hart says.",

Lopez, a gas station attendant, was stabbed to death in 1983 by a man who had been lurking outside the store and later came in demanding money. The journal article alleges that carlos hernandez, who died in prison on other charges in 1999, was the true murderer; deluna said the two men had been together at a strip club before the murder, and that he fled when he saw hernandez attack lopez. Both deluna and hernandez had histories of violence and substance abuse. Witnesses gave very different descriptions of the suspect, some of which matched deluna and others of which matched hernandez; the two men also happened to look similar. Deluna was found beneath a nearby truck, with no trace of blood on his white shirt even though lopez had bled profusely. The only witness who saw the struggle between lopez and her murderer was only half-sure deluna was the right man. The article goes on to assert other problems with the allegedly shoddy investigation and equally incompetent defense assigned to deluna. See the houston chronicle and the guardian for more.",

For some men, the reason for that might be in part because of their fathers — and their father's father — according to a new study, published online wednesday in the lancet. The study analyzed data from 3,233 unrelated white men enrolled in previous u.k. Studies. From this information, the researchers took a close look at genetic markers on the y chromosome, which is passed on from father to son. They found that 15 to 20 percent of the men fell into one of the 13 ancient ancestry branches known as haplogroup i. Men in this haplogroup, who all showed a common variant on the y chromosome, were 50 percent more likely to have coronary artery disease than those without it — even when age, body mass, cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking and other risk factors were taken into account.

No one really knows why. Now, a new study reports that part of the answer may lie on the y chromosome, the one chromosome unique to men. In the study, published on wednesday in the lancet, researchers found that nearly all british men have one of two variants of a cluster of genes on their y chromosome. Those with one of the variants had a 50 percent increased risk of heart disease compared with men with the other variant. This risk was independent of traditional factors like cholesterol, smoking and diabetes. The study needs to be replicated, researchers say, and while it raises intriguing hypotheses, it is not definitive.

            "Although heart disease is the leading killer of women as well as of men, two heart disease patients out of every three are male, and heart disease strikes men 10 to 15 years earlier than it does women. No one really knows why. Now, a new study reports that part of the answer may lie on the y chromosome, the one chromosome unique to men. In the study, published on wednesday in the lancet, researchers found that nearly all british men have one of two variants of a cluster of genes on their y chromosome. Those with one of the variants had a 50 percent increased risk of heart disease compared with men with the other variant. This risk was independent of traditional factors like cholesterol, smoking and diabetes. The study needs to be replicated, researchers say, and while it raises intriguing hypotheses, it is not definitive. Advertisement continue reading the main story the researchers also do not yet know which individual genes in the cluster are responsible for the increased risk, nor do they know why the genes have this effect. And the study, said its lead author, dr. Maciej tomaszewski of the university of leicester, does not completely explain the male disadvantage in heart disease."

All of which sets up a dicey situation for president trump, as a story at mcclatchy news service explains. Mercer wants irs chief john koskinen booted from office, and he's pushing trump to fire him before his five-year term expires in november. The president has not tipped his hand on whether he ' ll do that, but it makes for \" bad optics, \" per the chief ethics adviser in the george w. Bush white house. \" the guy's got a big case in front of the irs, \" says richard painter. \" he's trying to put someone in there who's going to drop the case. Is the president of the united states going to succumb to that? \" mercer, whose daughter rebekah is a major political player on the right as well, ramped up political contributions to conservative groups after the irs began investigating his fund's use of a complicated banking method known as \" basket options \" in 2010 to cut its tax bill, reports mcclatchy. The method involves converting short-term gains on trades into long-term gains, which are taxed at a lower rate. The irs does not comment on ongoing cases, but a senate panel accused the fund of short-changing the agency of at least $ 6.8 billion. The company has maintained that it did nothing illegal. One thing that could work in the mercers ' favor: they have long ties to top trump strategist steve bannon. Still, a columbia professor says that even if the mercers succeed in getting koskinen fired, it's doubtful that would upend a years-long irs case.",

        "summary": "Mohammed emwazi, the british-kuwaiti man who has been identified as \" jihadi john, \" had long been known to british security services — and according to the advocacy group cage, the way they treated him may have contributed to his radicalization. According to the group, when he tried to travel to tanzania for a \" safari vacation \" in 2009, he was detained, questioned, and returned to the uk by security officials who accused him of wanting to join militants, and he complained about harassment by security services in the years afterward. Cage says that after emwazi moved to kuwait later in 2009, he returned to britain for a visit the following year and was told he could not return to kuwait, leaving him feeling trapped and unable to return to his job and fiance. According to court papers seen by the bbc, however, authorities believed emwazi was part of a network \" involved in the provision of funds and equipment to somalia for terrorism-related purposes and the facilitation of individuals'travel from the united kingdom to somalia to undertake terrorism-related activity, \" and had at least one associate who ended up fighting in somalia with al-shabab radicals. The director of cage says emwazi was never \" somebody who ever said, 'i hate the system, i reject the system, ' \" reports the new york times. Instead, he says, \" it's someone who said, ' i don't like the environment, but i ' ll work within the system to effect change. ' \" but a lot of people aren't buying the argument that harsh treatment from security services turned emwazi into a brutal isis executioner. \" malcolm x and martin luther king got a lot more pressure from police, and neither decided that decapitating people is the right response, \" brookings institution fellow jm berger tells the times. After he was unable to return to kuwait, emwazi trained as an english teacher and changed his name to mohammed al-ayan in 2013, according to cage. After another failed attempt to get to kuwait, he left the family home in london to travel elsewhere. His parents reported him missing in august that year and were informed four months later that he was in syria. Around where emwazi grew up in a comfortable part of west london, people are stunned to find \" jihadi john \" once lived among them. \" it's a big shock to me and everyone here, \" a worshiper at a mosque 100 yards away from the address where emwazi grew up tells the washington post. \" he seems to be some sort of bogeyman for the muslim community.

Construction workers near seville wednesday stumbled upon about 1,300 pounds of bronze roman coins from the third and fourth centuries crammed into 19 ancient amphoras, the afp reports. The washington post reports that the workers noticed \" irregular terrain \" while toiling in a ditch a little more than 3 feet deep. Ana navarro, head of the local museum that's now taken over the excavation project, didn't pin an exact number on the coins ' value, simply stating they're worth \" certainly several million euros \" ( which would equate to several million dollars ) and that it's hard for her to assign a dollar amount because \" the value they really have is historical and you can't calculate that. \" navarro tells a local paper that \" this find is extremely important, \" with \" very few similar cases, \" per rt.com. The coins features images of emperors constantine and maximian, and their mint condition indicates they likely weren't in circulation. Navarro speculates the money was used to pay government taxes or the armed forces, and that the amphoras were buried \" because of social conflicts, violence, [ and other ] threats \" of the time. Navarro also notes that because the coin-filled containers are so heavy, it's probable they weren't placed underground by one person alone, cnn reports. The country's cultural department says no such coins exist in the seville archaeological museum's collection, per the ap. ( another recent find involved coins hailing from the nazi era. )",

As take part explains, the park city, utah, location advertised for temporary summer positions in 2013, complete with free housing and paid expenses — and then allegedly only hired women for those positions because the restaurant didn't want to deal with the hassle of coed housing. The eeoc is suing on behalf of andrew herrera, who worked at an oregon ruby tuesday, and joshua bell, who worked at a missouri one, both of whom applied for positions. The lawsuit accuses ruby tuesday of violating the civil rights act, and the eeoc wants ruby tuesday to stop hiring based on gender and to pay losses to herrera and bell. Despite the fact that the lawsuit was brought on behalf of men, experts tell take part it could help to protect all workers from discrimination, plus possibly improve work conditions since, one explains, \" jobs constructed as being for women pay less, have fewer promotional opportunities, and often, part of job is to be sexually available to male clients. \" adds another, \" the idea that a company would come up with an outright bar excluding men from applying to a job — if the eeoc didn't take steps to stop that, what would be next? \" ( at least one weatherman has also sued for sex discrimination. )",

Two hundred and nineteen of his neighbors down the street joined together in the house of representatives to pass historic health care legislation. Speaker nancy pelosi made it happen, but obama worked harder and more intensely than he has on any other issue of his presidency. He made 92 direct pitches to democratic members of the house, according to a white house tally. Last week he gave three speeches, culminating in an appeal to fellow democrats more personal and philosophical than any he's given since taking office.

            "President obama has just completed the most arduous act of community organizing of his career. Two hundred and nineteen of his neighbors down the street joined together in the house of representatives to pass historic health care legislation. Speaker nancy pelosi made it happen, but obama worked harder and more intensely than he has on any other issue of his presidency. He made 92 direct pitches to democratic members of the house, according to a white house tally. Last week he gave three speeches, culminating in an appeal to fellow democrats more personal and philosophical than any he's given since taking office.

Outside help is beginning to reach parts of the central philippines, as more horrific stories of the monster storm emerge — along with one of hope: the much-suffering tacloban, where authorities fear the death toll could be as high as 10,000, experienced the smallest bit of good news today: a 21-year-old survivor gave birth to a baby girl at the city's airport. Cheers broke out when the healthy baby was delivered to emily ortega, who had to swim and cling to a post to survive when the storm surge flooded the emergency center she was in. The afp reports the child has been named bea joy, after ortega's mother, beatriz, who was swept away by the waters. The us military has sent water, generators, and a contingent of around 90 marines and sailors to tacloban, the ap reports. They are at the forefront of a major international relief mission centered on the city, where few buildings are left standing and corpses are scattered in the streets. The philippine military has sent soldiers to the city amid reports that desperate survivors have attacked trucks ( including, reportedly, a red cross truck ) carrying food and water. A survivor in tacloban describes a desperate fight to stay alive after the storm flooded her home, drowning her mother and brother. \" the hardest thing is... Seeing your mother floating in the flood and you don't know what to do.

But this is the \" first concrete american response, \" notes the new york times. \" we appreciate the complexity of the situation, \" said obama. While conceding that mohamed morsi's government wasn't exactly a pillar of democracy, obama said the military should not have used force to oust him. A peaceful political solution was still possible immediately after the ouster, but yesterday's violence shows that military leaders instead chose a \" more dangerous path. \" the president called for the newly declared state of emergency to be lifted and asked \" people who are protesting to do so peacefully. \" he spoke as the official death toll passed the 500 milestone, a figure certain to rise.

        "summary": "Jurassic park had us all fooled: outstripping a tyrannosaurus rex in a jeep would've been easy-peasy because, well, t. Rex couldn't run. After much debate about how fast t. Rex moved — previous estimates suggested up to 45 miles per hour — scientists at the university of manchester used advanced computer simulations to come up with the most accurate assessment yet. Taking into account the beast's muscles and skeleton, they discovered running would've been \" impossible \" without a t. Rex's legs buckling under its 7-ton weight, per the bbc. Study author william sellers says t. Rex instead walked at a pace of up to 12 miles per hour — a fast jog for humans and less than half of usain bolt's top speed of 27.8mph, report reuters and buzzfeed. As a researcher not involved in the study tells national geographic, there's \" no way t. Rex could have chased down that jeep in jurassic park if it was going at highway speeds. Maybe if it was in first gear, but even that's a big if. \" while it's a welcome discovery for anyone who might find themselves transported back in time, it also provides insight into how t. Rex hunted. Juveniles may have been faster moving, but an adult t. Rex \" certainly would not have been able to chase down faster-moving prey animals, \" sellers says. That means t. Rex might have hid in forested areas and launched ambush attacks, or it might have dined mostly on slow-moving dinosaurs like triceratops, reports gizmodo. ( t. Rex sure had a nasty bite. )",

Racqual thompson, who is 8 1/2 months pregnant, was arrested on tuesday and charged with child endangerment, along with boyfriend cornell malone, reports click2houston. Prosecutors say the couple left four children — two 3-year-olds, a 5-year-old, and 19-month-old j ' zyra thompson — alone in their houston apartment while they went out to get pizza and visit malone's brother, abc13 reports. They returned to find three of the children crying, with j ' zyra dead and \" extremely burned \" in the tipped-over oven, which had been turned on \" all the way, \" according to court documents. Earlier court records, which have now been sealed, according to the ap, stated the 3-year-olds told authorities they had put j ' zyra in the oven and turned it on. A neighbor tells click2houston that the couple had bragged about not facing charges over the nov. 16 death. \" they were saying that it wasn't their fault, and that they're gonna get away with it, and they weren't there and this and that, \" he says. Thompson and malone are being held on $ 36,000 bond and the other children are now in the custody of child protective services, the houston chronicle reports. Authorities tell click2houston that in cases like thompson's, they ' ll wait for the mother to give birth before deciding whether to request cps custody.

        "summary": "The bible suggests the canaanites were wiped out by the ancient israelites, but a new study says otherwise, claiming the people survived and went on to be the ancestors of those who today live in lebanon, sciencedaily reports. Per a study in the american journal of human genetics, researchers from the uk's wellcome trust sanger institute sequenced the genomes of five 4,000-year-old canaanites, as well as 99 people now residing in lebanon — dna evidence that enabled the scientists to establish ancestry. The study results show an overwhelming majority of the genetic makeup ( 93 % ) of today's lebanese can be traced back to the canaanites, per the times of israel. Study co-author chris tyler-smith calls that percentage \" quite surprising, \" given the \" enormously complex history of this region, \" per sciencedaily. The bible's book of deuteronomy lays out what was to happen to the canaanites: \" completely destroy them... As the lord your god has commanded you. Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do. \" but some bible verses contradict the story of total annihilation, and the researchers write that \" no archaeological evidence has so far been found to support widespread destruction of canaanite cities between the bronze and iron ages. \" the canaanites made a major cultural impact during the bronze age, including introducing what's believed to have been the first alphabet. This new discovery sheds a bit more light on the rather mysterious group, who didn't leave much in the way of written records. ( this find could reveal the truth about goliath's people. )",

She \" felt that the haqqani network were really bad guys, \" congressman jim moran explains. Clinton was negotiating a tougher version of the deal that would have staggered the release of the taliban detainees, and subjected them to more restrictions, like monitoring and travel bans. At the time, people like adm. Mike mullen and leon panetta were advocating a rescue operation instead of a prisoner swap, the washington post reports. Obama hoped a swap would help along the afghan-taliban peace process, but clinton, robert gates, and james clapper all believed that releasing the detainees was too risky. A spokesman for clapper confirmed that he'd had doubts, but added that \" circumstances have changed dramatically \" since then.",

Researchers from russia's tomsk state university were digging at a fossil site in kazakhstan when they found bones belonging to the elasmotherium sibiricum, otherwise known as the \" siberian unicorn, \" huffington post reports. According to ifl science, this ancient giant rhinoceros, which has a horn protruding from the middle of its head, is thought to be the basis for modern tales of unicorns. The siberian unicorn is believed to have been about 20 feet long with a 7-foot horn, national geographic reports. But it wasn't the existence of elasmotherium sibiricum that caught researchers off guard; it was the age of the bones. Radiocarbon dating found one of the skulls to be only about 29,000 years old, according to a press release. Scientists had long believed the siberian unicorn went extinct 350,000 years ago. If the team's research — which was published in the american journal of applied sciences — holds up, it means unicorns and humans walked the earth at the same time, though in different places.

The association's director of sport promotion says she's since learned bickford loosened securing straps, including on his legs, after the tandem parachute he wore was opened. \" state police interviews with other skydivers and industry officials concluded that no experienced skydiver would loosen a parachute harness by mistake … it was an intentional act, \" a maine department of public safety rep tells the bangor daily news.

        "summary": "A big win for animal rights activists — and a bigger win for dogs and cats — in taiwan. With the legislature's approval of an amendment to the country's animal protection act, taiwan appears on track to become the first country in asia to ban the possession, sale, purchase, and consumption of cat and dog meat, reports the guardian. The amendment that passed tuesday, which includes fines of up to $ 8,100 for offenders, still needs to be signed by the president, but tsai ing-wen is known to be an animal lover and is expected to do so by the end of the month. The measure also doubles the maximum penalty for animal cruelty to up to two years in prison and a $ 65,000 fine. Though dog and cat meat were once popular in taiwan, the animals are now most often viewed as pets and family members. Tsai even brought her two adopted cats along on the campaign trail prior to her election last year, while promising to do more to protect animals, reports the telegraph. She also has three retired guide dogs, which she adopted. Animal activists hope china and south korea, where the consumption of dog meat is more common, will follow taiwan's lead, per cnn. However, china's infamous yulin dog meat festival, where 10,000 dogs are slaughtered and eaten each year, is expected to kick off without a hitch on june 21 — even with 675,000 signatures on a petition calling for its end. ( in moscow, orange-toothed river rat is now a popular meal. )",
