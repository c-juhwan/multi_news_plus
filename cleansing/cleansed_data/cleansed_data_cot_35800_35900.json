        "summary": "Last month, kickstarter taught us that only 315 people still care about melissa joan hart's career. This month, it teaches us that even fewer people care about zosia mamet's music. Mamet isn't exactly struggling in life — in addition to starring on the wildly popular girls, she's the daughter of playwright david mamet — yet she and sister clara ( who's also on a tv show, abc's the neighbors ) still went on the crowdfunding site to ask the general public for $ 32,000 so the duo ( act name: the cabin sisters ) could make a music video. The campaign ended unsuccessfully yesterday, with just 80 backers pledging $ 2,783, tmz reports. The campaign was the target of much derision, and some even speculated it was some sort of supposed-to-be-ironic prank, but tmz confirmed with the sisters'reps that the ladies really were hoping to get funded. Perhaps people didn't take too kindly to lines like this from the campaign video: \" my sister clara and i decided to start this band basically as an excuse to spend more time together. \" sounds inspired! our favorite comment left on the campaign page: \" i am so excited to see what kind of music video $ 32,000 buys! i don't know a lot about music videos, though i did make one once with a $ 150 smartphone and some free editing software, and if my calculations are accurate a $ 32,000 music video should be approximately 213.33 times better. \"",

Visually the video will bounce from opulence to sparseness, french baroque to a simple, timeless and heartbroken. We are hoping to capture something everyone has felt at some point in their lives. Thank you so much for taking the time to visit our kickstarter page. As you heard in our video this band sort of just happened. We come from a musical family and music has been a common bond for us since a young age.

        "summary": "As the climate warms, scientists are conducting experiments around the world to try to boost drought resistance in a wide range of crops. But a study out of the riken center for sustainable resource science in japan is especially promising because the key ingredient helping a wide range of crops survive severe drought is cheap and readily available: vinegar. Reporting in the journal nature plants, the researchers say that plants grown in drought conditions and treated with water or other organic acids all died — but 70 % of those treated with just acetic acid ( vinegar ) lived. The study came about because scientists are trying to understand why a mutation to an enzyme called hda6 in arabidopsis plants makes them so drought resistant, reports phys.org. In normal conditions, hda6 represses the production of acetic acid. During a drought, hda6 is involved in a biological pathway that actually produces acetate, a salt that is a byproduct of acetic acid. In the arabidopsis plants that are drought resistant, that pathway is extra active, producing far more acetate, reports popular science. Sure enough, in what modern farmer reports \" could be a hugely important discovery, \" vinegar helped multiple crops in this study, including rice, wheat, and maize, survive drought-like conditions. Researchers say vinegar would be a far simpler and less costly solution than, say, genetically modifying most plants. ( more than 100 million trees recently died in california. )",

Further analysis showed that activity of the hda6 enzyme acts as a switch that controls which type of metabolic pathway is active.

In fact, that location was hit twice, according to the new york post. Advertisement a new uniform concept for apple employees introduced by apple's senior vp of retail might be to blame for the robberies. In 2015, angela ahrendts announced her vision for uniforms called \"back to blue... But all new \" which introduced several different styles of shirts for employees to wear.

            "Thieves outsmarted the geniuses at an apple store on the upper west side — twice — to swipe dozens of iphones in the past month, police said tuesday. Three crooks — including a woman disguised as an apple worker — first stole eight iphones worth more than $ 5,300 from the store on broadway at west 67th street around 1: 30 p.m. On feb. 16, according to police and an apple source. A male cohort distracted the real workers, while another acted as a lookout during the heist. Then, last tuesday, three thieves used the ruse to net 59 iphones worth $ 44,000. This time, a man dressed as a worker walked over to the store's genius bar help desk and snatched handfuls of new iphone 6s from a storage drawer, said police and the company source. He handed the batches off to a female accomplice hiding out in a nearby bathroom, where she stuffed them into a duffel bag, the source said. The third male crook acted as a lookout. A clerk finally noticed the ruse and called security, but the trio had already fled. The stolen phones weren't tagged with sensors and were unlocked. The crooks may have targeted the shop because it's a training location, where \"nobody would question \" an unfamiliar worker in blue, the store source said"

That's what arkady babchenko said thursday in an interview from kiev cited by reuters. Babchenko, whose wife found him in their apartment building, said he was even taught how to fall as if he had been shot, and that he wore a shirt riddled with bullet holes, cnn reports. He was taken by ambulance ( where a doctor pronounced him dead ) to a morgue, where he \" came back to life, \" changed clothes, and turned on the news to watch reports of his death. \" what a great guy i was, \" he joked thursday. The government said he had been shot dead before revealing he was still alive the following day. Babchenko says ukrainian officials approached him about a month ago with the idea to foil what they say was a russian security services plot to have him assassinated. The anti-kremlin journalist, 41, says the choice was his and he agreed to the plan to fake his own death, cbs news reports. Two people allegedly involved with the russian plot are reportedly in custody. Babchenko also confirmed his wife did not know about the ruse in advance, and apologized to her \" for the hell she had to go through in the past two days. There was no choice there. \" international media advocacy group reporters without borders decried that plan thursday: \" it is always very dangerous for a government to play with the facts, especially using journalists for their fake stories, \" the group's director tweeted. But babchenko thursday said he was only concerned with the survival of himself and his family, not journalistic ethics. Meanwhile, russia has slammed the faked death as anti-russia propaganda.",

        "summary": "So must a baker make a cake for a gay couple even if he opposes same-sex marriage? the answer, it seems, lies solely with anthony kennedy. That's the gist of coverage from tuesday's closely watched arguments in the supreme court. The washington post reports that the four more liberal justices seemed to side with the gay couple, while the four more conservative justices leaned toward the baker. That leaves kennedy in the familiar position of casting the deciding vote, but he didn't seem particularly happy with either side on tuesday. He sent \" sharply contradictory \" messages with his questions, per adam liptak in the new york times. In an analysis at scotusblog, however, amy howe suggests that when all was said and done, the edge seemed to go to the baker. Kennedy \" initially seemed sympathetic to the same-sex couple but later expressed real concern that colorado had not been sufficiently tolerant of the baker's religious freedom, \" she writes. Along those lines, the wall street journal calls attention to one of kennedy's comments in which he declared, \"it seems to me the state has been neither tolerant or respectful \" of the baker's views. However, the story then quickly noted that kennedy's comments \" cut in opposite directions. \" one possible outcome being floated: given concerns voiced by kennedy and others that the state's civil rights commission treated baker jack phillips unfairly, the court could send the case back to the commission with orders for an unbiased hearing.

But jack phillips, the owner of the bakery, refused to make them a cake.

Louis was home to a purification plant for raw uranium ore as part of the manhattan project, which led to a dumping ground and storage site for radioactive waste. Today, residents are still feeling the effects, according to a lawsuit filed tuesday, per the guardian. Robbin and mike dailey say dust samples from their home in the suburb of bridgeton contain the radioactive element thorium-230 in levels up to 1,000 times greater than normal — allegedly the result of illegal dumping at a nearby landfill in the 1970s, reports the st. Louis post-dispatch. The epa found radioactive particles in rainwater runoff near the landfill in may, per st. Louis public radio, though the company in charge of the site — one of nine named in the daileys'suit — says it's safe. Yet the daileys'samples are no fluke: last year, thorium-230 was found on properties along a tributary of the missouri river that travels through suburbs north of st. Louis, while a radioactive lead was found in samples from northern st. Louis county. Studies also show high rates of autoimmune diseases and cancer in the area. \" honestly, people literally die, and we're still sitting here doing nothing, \" says a woman whose 11-year-old daughter died of a rare form of brain cancer in 2011; she says all six in her household \" have issues. \" \" i had a good cry, \" says robbin dailey of the test results. \" after that i was pissed as hell and ready to fight. \" per the litigation daily, it's \" likely to be a massive fight. \" ( an atomic bomb test may have sickened people, too. )",

Korea calls north missile tests calculated provocation ( afp ) – 14 hours ago seoul — south korea on friday labelled north korea's test firing of four short-range missiles a calculated, provocative act timed to coincide with south-us joint military exercises. North korea test-fired the missiles into the sea of japan on thursday, three days after the joint drills kicked off in the face of vocal opposition from pyongyang. \" with the exercises underway, we see the firings as a calculated, provocative act, \" defence ministry spokesman kim min-seok told journalists. He noted that the launches also came days after an incursion by a north korean patrol boat across the disputed yellow sea border that has been the scene of brief but bloody naval clashes in the past. Kim said the tests were of scud-type missiles at the longer edge of the short-range spectrum, with an estimated reach of 300-800 kilometres ( 185-500 miles ) -- capable of striking any target in the south. \" if the north re-engineers scuds or tests them, we always undertake a serious analysis to consider counter-measures, \" he said. Kim stressed that the annual military drills with the united states would continue as planned. In washington, state department spokeswoman jen psaki urged north korea \" to exercise restraint and take steps to improve its relations with its neighbours \". But pentagon spokesman colonel steven warren acknowledged that such short-range tests did not put the north in breach of international resolutions. \" we view this as an unannounced weapons test that we see somewhat regularly, \" he told reporters in washington.

A defense ministry official said north korea fired four projectiles believed to be short-range missiles with a range of more than 200 kilometers ( about 125 miles ) into the waters off its east coast.

            "S. Korea calls north missile tests calculated provocation ( afp ) – 14 hours ago seoul — south korea on friday labelled north korea's test firing of four short-range missiles a calculated, provocative act timed to coincide with south-us joint military exercises. North korea test-fired the missiles into the sea of japan on thursday, three days after the joint drills kicked off in the face of vocal opposition from pyongyang. \" with the exercises underway, we see the firings as a calculated, provocative act, \" defence ministry spokesman kim min-seok told journalists. He noted that the launches also came days after an incursion by a north korean patrol boat across the disputed yellow sea border that has been the scene of brief but bloody naval clashes in the past. Kim said the tests were of scud-type missiles at the longer edge of the short-range spectrum, with an estimated reach of 300-800 kilometres ( 185-500 miles ) -- capable of striking any target in the south. \" if the north re-engineers scuds or tests them, we always undertake a serious analysis to consider counter-measures, \" he said. Kim stressed that the annual military drills with the united states would continue as planned. In washington, state department spokeswoman jen psaki urged north korea \" to exercise restraint and take steps to improve its relations with its neighbours \". But pentagon spokesman colonel steven warren acknowledged that such short-range tests did not put the north in breach of international resolutions. \" we view this as an unannounced weapons test that we see somewhat regularly, \" he told reporters in washington. It is not unusual for north korea to carry out such tests and observers said they were unlikely to trigger a significant rise in military tensions. Despite the start of the south korea-us drills on monday, which the north",

North korea routinely conducts short-range missile tests, but the latest came three days after south korea and the u.s. Began annual military drills that pyongyang calls a rehearsal for invasion. A defense ministry official said north korea fired four projectiles believed to be short-range missiles with a range of more than 200 kilometers ( about 125 miles ) into the waters off its east coast. The official spoke anonymously citing department rules.

        "summary": "A mississippi police officer fatally shot 41-year-old ismael lopez late sunday night while attempting to serve an arrest warrant. A lawyer for the lopez family says police had the wrong house, nbc news reports. According to the washington post, lopez was in bed when he heard a sound outside his home in southaven. He got up to see what was going on; moments later he was dead. Prosecutor john champion tells the commercial appeal that lopez was pointing a gun at the two police officers outside his house through a partially open door and ignored orders to put the gun down. Champion says it appears one officer shot at a pit bull that ran out of lopez's home and the other shot at lopez himself. There were three bullet holes in lopez's door. It's unclear if lopez fired any shots or if he knew the people at his front door were police officers. Attorney murray wells says neither lopez's wife nor a neighbor heard the officers tell lopez to drop the gun. In fact, he says lopez, who has no criminal history and was not wanted for anything, wasn't even holding a gun during the shooting. Wells says there was a gun on the couch at the time. He says police were attempting to serve an arrest warrant for samuel pearman, who lives next door. Wells says the two homes are 36 feet apart and both have their addresses clearly visible. Pearman was wanted on a domestic abuse charge. An investigation into the shooting is underway.",

Officials in tomsk have charged the police officer allegedly responsible, but they have tried to excuse his actions, saying that he was suffering from stress at the time, the guardian reports. Popov was arrested for being drunk and playing his guitar too loudly, not for his journalistic activities, but his case has focused attention on police abuses in russia and some believe he was singled out for harsh treatment because of his profession. \" the figures on assaults against journalists in russia speak for themselves, \" an analyst at the center for journalism in extreme situations tells the christian science monitor. \" this latest monstrous act of arbitrariness by police is, sadly, nothing out of the ordinary in this country. \"",

Per usa today, a kayaker who helped rush the bloodied victim out of the water following saturday's incident in encinitas said the predator tailed his vessel as it made its way to shore. Chad hammel told the paper he was among the first to respond to the 13-year-old's shouts for help. When they pulled the unnamed teen into the kayak, hammel said the shark wasn't far behind and wasn't ready to give up. Hammel provided gory details about the boy's injuries, stating that it appeared as if the flesh at his collar bone had been ripped open. Hammel said he did what he could to calm the boy, who was conscious, before he was soon airlifted to a hospital. He underwent emergency surgery and was subsequently listed in critical but stable condition. Per the ap, the boy was at the shore north of san diego skin diving at the start of the popular spiny lobster season when the attack occurred. While witnesses estimated the shark was around 11 feet long, officials were still working over the weekend to determine the species. ( just weeks ago, a boogie boarder lost his life across the country in cape cod's first fatal shark attack in 82 years. )",

The list, which was part of a high school assignment, said: \" kiss in the rain. Fly to spain. Save a life ( not really scary though. ) \" the danbury, conn., teen's sister tells buzzfeed that rebecca had traveled to spain, and kissed her boyfriend in the rain — and a friend injured by the same car says the last thing he can remember is rebecca pushing him out of the way. Rebecca had just graduated from immaculate high school, whose principal tells the newstimes that she was a \" wonderful, wonderful person \" who founded the school's chapter of she's the first, a charity that helps girls in the world's poorest countries. On remembering rebecca, a facebook page in her memory, relatives explain that the \" bucket list \" assignment was returned at the end of her senior year and they found it on her bed marked \" for future rebecca townsend. \" the page urges people to \" keep rebecca's spirit alive by showing kindness to others, \" and people have responded by setting up blood drives and founding new chapters of she's the first.

Italian researchers used a ct scan to measure the vocal tract and vocal chords of a 5,300-year-old mummy known as otzi the iceman, and produced this video to demonstrate what his voice sounded like when pronouncing vowels, reports seeker. It didn't help that otzi died — was murdered, actually — with his arm over his throat, but the researchers used a software program to move it virtually. Technically, he speaks in a frequency between 100hz and 150hz, on par with a modern male. Non-technically, he kind of sounds like a chain-smoker, notes discover. One reason for the new research is that this year is the 25th anniversary of the discovery of otzi in the italian alps. In another bit of archaeological sleuthing to mark the occasion, detectives and scientists attempted to figure out how otzi ended up with an arrow in his back, one fired from a good distance, reports news.com.au. Because otzi also had a recently healed defensive wound on his hand when killed, they suspect he had some kind of fight a few days before his death, and his rival hunted him down in revenge. His copper ax was still with him, so robbery seemed unlikely. If it all sounds worthy of the big screen, hollywood agrees: otzi's story is being adapted for a movie starting german actor jurgen vogel, according to the hollywood reporter.

        "summary": "So why did birds survive the mass extinction that wiped out their dinosaur relatives? a new study suggests that the shape of their eggs played a role, reports the bbc. Scientists aren't sure exactly what that role was, but they do know that eggs of survivor birds were shaped differently than eggs of dinosaurs and birds that got wiped out. Among other things, the non-survivor eggs were more elongated and \" significantly more symmetrical, \" says the news service. The difference in shape suggests that the birds themselves differed in physiology, reports phys.org, presumably in ways that gave them an advantage when the mass extinction took place 65 million years ago. One theory is that the differences in shape may have something to do with crucial differences in hatching and nesting behavior. \" i suspect modern birds survived the major extinction event because they used contact incubation that's prevalent now, \" says one researcher from the uk's university of lincoln. \" they built nests and sat on their eggs whereas most of the birds prior to that were burying the eggs like their theropod ancestors, potentially making them more vulnerable. \" ( click to read how hummingbirds aren't as gentle as you might think when it comes to mating rituals. )",

        "summary": "Twice a jury appeared before a court monday to announce a not guilty verdict in the 2014 burning death of 19-year-old jessica chambers — and twice it was revealed the decision was actually split. Finally, judge gerald chatham declared a mistrial due to a \" hopelessly deadlocked \" jury, though prosecutors immediately stated they intended to try quinton tellis again for capital murder, reports the jackson clarion-ledger. According to prosecutors, phone records show 29-year-old tellis, an acquaintance of chambers, was with her around the time she was doused in gasoline and set on fire in courtland, miss., on dec. 6, 2014. Defense attorneys, however, stressed that chambers identified her attacker as \" eric \" or \" derek \" before she died, per wreg. Though usa today reports chambers ' mouth was so badly charred that she mispronounced her own last name as \" tambers, \" tellis ' family urged authorities to \" find eric \" as they celebrated the mistrial. Defense attorney alton peterson described the result as \" very unusual, \" adding, \" i've never seen it happen before, \" per wreg and cnn. After a week-long trial, jurors apparently believed only a guilty verdict required a unanimous decision; they returned with a split not guilty verdict even after the judge reminded them that a decision had to be unanimous. Peterson says his \" great sense of relief \" quickly evaporated. It's not yet clear when a new trial could take place. Tellis also faces charges in a separate murder in louisiana and is serving time in prison for using credit cards belonging to that victim.",

Police say unlicensed caregiver lori conley is to blame for giving 8-month-old haddix mulkey a drug he never should have taken, abc news reports. Authorities say mulkey dropped off haddix at conley's home in reynoldsburg, ohio, on may 13, and during the day conley quieted haddix with a dose of the allergy medication benadryl. Conley, who was babysitting eight toddlers and infants, later found him unresponsive and hysterically rushed him outside seeking help — but responding paramedics couldn't revive him, police tell the columbus dispatch. A toxicology report released friday found that haddix died from a deadly dose of benadryl. Conley \" told detectives the child was fussy and that she gave him an adult dose of benadryl to help him sleep, \" says a police sergeant.

The man killed after fbi and state police stopped vehicles on highway 395 has been identified as robert \" lavoy \" finicum, 55, a spokesman for the occupation and one of its most visible members, the oregonian reports. \" he would never ever want to hurt somebody, but he does believe in defending freedom and he knew the risks involved, \" one of the arizona rancher's 11 children tells the paper. In other developments: the fbi and oregon state police say group leader ammon bundy and his brother ryan were among five people arrested after the highway incident, oregon public broadcasting reports. Two men were arrested in the nearby town of burns, and another suspect was arrested in arizona. Authorities say ryan bundy, 43, suffered a gunshot wound during the incident and was treated in a hospital before being released to fbi custody. It isn't clear how many people remain at the malheur national wildlife refuge, which the protesters seized in early january. Bundy supporter brand thornton says he left on monday. \" the entire leadership is gone, \" he tells the ap. \" i wouldn't blame any of them for leaving. \" there are conflicting accounts of the highway shooting. Nevada lawmaker michele fiore says ammon bundy called his wife and told her that finicum was cooperating with authorities when he was shot, but sources tell the oregonian that he resisted arrest and ignored an order to surrender. Raw story reports that one of the two men arrested in arizona is jon ritzheimer, another high-profile occupier. In a facebook post, he says he came home to see his daughters before turning himself in, and he asks for donations to help with legal fees. The fbi says all eight people arrested will face a federal felony charge of \" conspiracy to impede officers of the united states from discharging their official duties through the use of force, intimidation, or threat, \" per the ap. \" i am pleased that the fbi has listened to the concerns of the local community and responded to the illegal activity occurring in harney county by outside extremists, \" oregon sen. Jeff merkley said in a statement. \" i hope that the remaining individuals occupying the malheur national wildlife refuge will peacefully surrender. \" one occupier still at the refuge tells the new york times that the plan now is to wait for sunlight \" and see what's up. \" jason patrick says the mood is \" prepared but",

The technical problems with the website set up for the affordable care act have been well-documented and security flaws have been discovered.

        "summary": "Knight capital desperately needed somebody in shining armor to come to its rescue after it lost $ 440 million in 45 minutes last week, and a lifeline has arrived — but at a very heavy cost to shareholders. A group of financial services and private equity firms has agreed to a $ 400 million rescue package that values the firm, which was trading at $ 10.33 early last week, at just $ 1.50 per share, sources tell reuters. The deal leaves the consortium owning up to 75 % of knight. The firm's trading nightmare was caused by a glitch in its new trading software. The change in ownership will not affect the investigation into both knight and the high-speed trading which made the loss possible, notes the new york times. Knight was responsible for more than a tenth of all trading in american stocks in the first half of the year, and the speed of its near-demise has shocked wall street. It remains to be seen whether its clients, who rapidly deserted the firm last week, can be persuaded to return.",

Researchers at the university of toronto call it \" reorienting one's priorities, \" and report in the journal of experimental psychology: general that wiping our hands acts as a physical proxy for mentally separating ideas that are still kicking around in our heads. This allows us to refocus on a new goal. The researchers tested this by having participants focus on certain goals by taking a short survey or playing word games. Some participants were then asked to evaluate what they'd done, while others were asked to use a handwipe to clean their hands first. Sure enough, those who cleaned their hands were less likely to think of the goal they'd been primed to focus on and less likely to find it important, reports entrepreneur. But that's not inherently a good thing. \" for people who were primed with a health goal, for example, using the handwipe reduced their subsequent tendency to behave in a healthy manner — they were more likely to choose a chocolate bar over a granola bar, \" one of the researchers says.

Obama said he has asked congress to postpone any vote on the potential use of force until moscow's plan plays out on the international stage. \" it's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the assad regime keeps its commitments, but this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because russia is one of assad's strongest allies, \" said obama. If the initiative fails, however, america is obligated to act given the nature of chemical weapons, he said. \" that's what makes america different. That's what makes america exceptional. \" ( read the full transcript via the washington post. ) the president — who reiterated that \" i will not put american boots on the ground \" — also made the case that stopping such weapons is a matter of national security for the us: \" if we fail to act, \" bashar al-assad will keep using them, and \" other tyrants \" and terrorist organizations could follow suit. Iran might be emboldened to shrug off international law in regard to nuclear weapons. \" when dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory, but these things happened, \" said the president, who encouraged people to look at the videos from syria for themselves. As for the diplomatic path: it seemed to be making progress for most of the day but suffered a late setback when russia rejected the idea of any un resolution that called for the possibility of military action, reports the ap. Moscow wants any use of force off the table, and a resolution being drawn up by france doesn't oblige. John kerry, meanwhile, is set to meet with his russian counterpart on thursday in geneva.",

Bart police touched off a free speech debate that generated international news coverage when they switched off the gadgetry aug. 11 that enables people to use their cell phones and wireless devices in san francisco's market street subway. The controversy also drew the ire of anonymous, a secretive group promoting free speech and internet",
            "There are lawful ways to protest outside the fare gates or go to bart board meetings -- that's appropriate, not making anonymous demands, \" allison said. \" we stand by our decision to interrupt cell-phone service. Earlier todayreported that anonymous, the secret hacking group responsible for bart protests, fired off a list of demands the transit agency would have to meet before the group would put an end to the weekly protests that have snarled evening commutes. And one of those demands was for bart to fire its chief spokesman linton johnson.to show they are serious about their ill feelings toward johnson, members of the group released saucy photos that allegedly show the bare-chested johnson pulling down his pants, giving a full-frontal view of his genitals. Accompanying the partially nude photos is the following message: \" if you are going to be a dick to the public, then i ' m sure you don't mind showing your dick to the public. \" who knows where the vulgar photos originated from, but the pictures are blowing up on twitter. Johnson became a target after the veteran spokesman told media outlets that it was his idea to shutdown cell-phone service in effort to block coordination of a scheduled protest -- and that it was well within bart's right to do so.jim allison, a spokesman for bart, agency said he"

Claudia marcelloni/cern for now, physicists are only willing to call them ' excess events ', but fresh data from two experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are hinting at something unusual — and it could be the most sought-after particle in all of physics. Both atlas and the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiments are seeing an unusual surplus of events in a rough mass range of 130 – 150 gigaelectronvolts ( energy and mass are used interchangeably in particle physics ). The data are far from conclusive, but physicists believe this could be the first indication of the higgs particle, believed to be responsible for the masses of other particles. The results were presented this afternoon at the europhysics conference on high energy physics in grenoble, france. Physicists familiar with the experiments urge caution.

Researchers at the large hadron collider say they could confirm the existence of the higgs boson within a matter of months. Claudia marcelloni/cern for now, physicists are only willing to call them ' excess events ', but fresh data from two experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are hinting at something unusual — and it could be the most sought-after particle in all of physics. Both atlas and the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiments are seeing an unusual surplus of events in a rough mass range of 130 – 150 gigaelectronvolts ( energy and mass are used interchangeably in particle physics ). The data are far from conclusive, but physicists believe this could be the first indication of the higgs particle, believed to be responsible for the masses of other particles. The results were presented this afternoon at the europhysics conference on high energy physics in grenoble, france. Physicists familiar with the experiments urge caution. The new data are a long way from a discovery, says matthew strassler, a theoretical physicist at rutgers university in new jersey. \" i would call it tantalizing. \" the hunt for higgs since its prediction in 1964, the higgs has been the most wanted particle in all of physics.",

If 2012's numbers are any clue, however, things are changing: the figure rose to 29 %, pew research reports. The climbing numbers turn a three-decade trend upside down. What's changed? the ap highlights the high cost of childcare: on average, the weekly cost of childcare for families with working moms shot up 70 % between 1985 and 2011, from $ 87 to $ 148. Some 34 % of stay-at-home moms live in poverty, while 12 % of working mothers do. An increase in the number of immigrant mothers also helps explain the reversal, as immigrant moms generally stay home more than american-born mothers do — about 40 % of them, compared to about a quarter of us moms. Many women are also unable to find work, and the recession didn't help, bloomberg notes. Meanwhile, \" most americans continue to believe that it's best for children to have a parent at home, \" the study's lead author notes. Still, she says, \" the majority of mothers would like to be in the workplace. \"",

            "To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It's a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. According to a theory i sometimes hear, i should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends. Photo i didn't refuse, nor did others.

Researcher he jiankui says he tweaked embryos with crispr technology in the hope of making the resulting infants naturally resistant to hiv, reports the ap. He's claims have not been independently confirmed, and he's keeping a lid on details about the infants ' identities. He revealed the details to the ap ahead of an international conference on gene editing in hong kong, and also talked about his work in this video. Prior to the ap interview, mit technology review found chinese medical documents online this month revealing details about the study, including the recruitment of couples willing to take part. The development is a hugely controversial one, given the debate over \" designer babies. \" \" i feel a strong responsibility that it's not just to make a first, but also make it an example, \" he tells the ap. \" society will decide what to do next \" in terms of embracing similar research or imposing restrictions. That sentiment countered quotes like this one from dr. Eric topol, head of the scripps research translational institute in california: \" this is far too premature. We're dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It's a big deal. \" the development, if confirmed, would be a \" stunning medical achievement, \" per mit, though one fraught with ethical concerns. The crispr-cas9 editing tool has been used on adults, but any changes in those cases are restricted to the test subject. Editing embryos is a different matter, explains the ap, because any changes could be passed on to children. ( could crispr help conquer cocaine addiction? )",

Volunteers are slowly combing over what the un estimates to be 8 million tons of rubble — enough to form three separate piles as big as the great pyramid of giza — to recover the bodies of civilians and isis fighters responsible for a putrid smell in the air. \" we only stop when it gets too dark or we get too tired, \" nurse sroor al-hosayni tells the bbc. She says city officials suggested allowing stray dogs to eat the corpses, per usa today. \" i told them there were not enough dogs, \" she says. \" there are thousands of bodies. \" hidden dangers, like unexploded bombs and suicide vests, are complicating efforts. A doctor tells usa today some volunteers have been injured in the collection of 860 bodies so far. The corpses pose health risks for others, too. The world health organization has warned those living downstream of iraq's second-largest city are at risk of gastroenteritis from remains around the tigris river. Yet rebuilding is already a focus. Though it will take a year just to clear the site, mosul is preparing to rebuild the al-nouri mosque and 800-year-old al-hadba minaret, destroyed by isis fighters, with a $ 50 million donation from the united arab emirates, reports the new york times. A resident of mosul's old city, almost entirely destroyed by fighting, feels officials might be jumping the gun. \" while there are many historic buildings officials need to preserve and protect, the government should do something to help the volunteers who have been working so hard, \" shihab ahmed tells usa today.",

        "summary": "The speaker of britain's house of commons said monday that he strongly opposes letting us president donald trump address parliament during a state visit to the uk, the ap reports. Speaker john bercow's unusual public intervention makes it unlikely trump will be given the honor during his trip later this year. Bercow told lawmakers he would have been against extending the invitation even before trump's temporary ban on citizens of seven majority-muslim nations entering the us. He said that after the migrant ban was issued, \" i am even more strongly opposed. \" bercow's comments were unusual — the bbc calls his rebuke \" unprecedented and extraordinary \" — because speakers in the british parliament are expected to remain above the partisan fray. Bercow is one of the parliamentary officials who would have to agree on inviting a foreign dignitary to address lawmakers and peers. World leaders given the honor of making a speech to both houses of parliament include nelson mandela and trump's predecessor, president barack obama. Bercow was cheered by opposition lawmakers when he said that, although britain values its relationship with the us, \" our opposition to racism and to sexism, and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary, are hugely important considerations. \" trump is due to visit britain later this year as the guest of queen elizabeth ii. The invitation was announced by prime minister theresa may when she visited trump in washington last month. May's office said the dates and itinerary for the state visit have not yet been finalized.",

But if leonid bershidsky has his way, it will go to none of the above. \" i hope the prize goes to german chancellor angela merkel, \" he writes at bloomberg. She's the favorite with 6-1 odds of winning, and bershidsky says there's good reason, particularly in her responses to europe's refugee crisis, the ukraine-russia conflict, and the greek economic crisis. Faced with vladimir putin's attack on ukraine, for example, merkel chose to push for sanctions she knew would hurt germany's economy rather than keep up the country's cozy relationship with russia. She went on to help craft the ceasefire that would stop the fighting, bershidsky says. Then, confronted with the refugee crisis, merkel \" decided to bend european rules and accept those fleeing the syrian war rather then send them back to their eu country of entry, \" helping to get \" hundreds of thousands housed and fed, \" bershidsky writes. In fact, \" she may have sacrificed her political future to pursue that course. \" next, \" rather than allow greece to flout european rules and set a bad example for others, she got it back on eu life support, under tougher conditions than before, but perhaps with better chances of survival, \" bershidsky says. \" no one has done as much as merkel this year for peace, and for people fleeing war, \" he concludes, adding barack obama arguably won the prize for much less.

Police say kitterman — found \" tired \" but in seemingly good condition in a kmart parking lot in pueblo yesterday — told them he'd simply had \" his fill of football and decided to go for a walk … to somewhere warmer, \" the denver post reports. That walk ended 118 miles south of where he started out, with kitterman resting in tree-shaded areas and in bushes along the way and even ditching his broncos cap so no one would recognize him, according to his statements to police. Authorities called relatives to come get him while he rested in a local room the police chaplain arranged for him, abc news reports. Kitterman's family members publicized his case in the hopes of gaining widespread attention ( they did ) to help find the missing 53-year-old; they phoned local hospitals, detox centers, and jails, the post notes, and put up fliers ( kitterman said he didn't know there had been so much hubbub about his disappearance ). But a family spokesperson asked for privacy earlier today in a facebook post that appears to have since been taken down. \" the family is happy to report paul has been found and they are now with him and he is safe, \" the post says, per abc news. \" we know there are many questions that some of you may have but for the time being we are asking that you respect [ their ] privacy as they have been through a lot. \" ( the mother-in-law of megadeth's lead singer is still missing. )",

Researchers at brunel university london reviewed the status updates of 555 facebook users who completed surveys about self-esteem, narcissism, and the \" big five \" personality traits: extroversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they found those with different personality traits chose to share very different information. Extroverts, for example, frequently wrote about social events and tended to use facebook exclusively to socialize, the independent reports. Conscientious people often wrote about their children, while people with open personalities didn't shy away from sharing political views or social itinerary. People with low self-esteem, meanwhile, frequently posted about their romantic partners. \" people are more likely to post relationship-relevant information on facebook on days when they feel insecure, \" researchers say, adding it's \" reasonable \" to see the move as a way to \" claim \" their relationship. However, those with low self-esteem didn't aim for attention and validation so much as narcissists, who were found to share updates about their achievements, as well as their diet and fitness routine, which suggests a deliberate display of the energy put into their appearance. Researchers say narcissists also posted more and received more likes and comments than others, but \" it could be that their facebook friends politely offer support while secretly disliking such egotistical displays, \" the researchers say in a press release. \" greater awareness of how one's status updates might be perceived by friends could help people to avoid topics that annoy more than they entertain. \" and, as the study was self-reported, narcissists may have inflated the number of likes and comments they received, per business insider.

Rodriguez says daniels, whose real name is stephanie clifford, will soon announce when she plans to go public with her story. Legal experts, meanwhile, say cohen's story that he made a $ 130,000 payment to daniels out of his own pocket without being reimbursed by trump is highly improbable — and if it's true, it could be a violation of campaign finance laws. \" the thing seems so weird that it invites an inquiry into what you're doing, \" charles wolfram at cornell university tells the new york times. \" lawyers don't go around giving $ 130,000 to strangers, benefiting their clients, without billing their clients. \" cohen declined to tell the times whether he made an arrangement with trump at the time of the payment — or whether he made more payments to other women.",

The scans can be used for identification much like a fingerprint, and critics are worried about abuse. The fbi says scanning began as part of a pilot project to \" develop a system capable of performing iris image recognition services \" as agents work to expand the fbi's identification system to include facial recognition and palm prints. The fbi collaborates with other agencies to collect the scans, along with california, texas, and missouri. The aclu says the database now available — to which 189 scans were added daily by authorities in san bernardino, calif., alone at the start of the year — is \" without any public debate or oversight \" and \" very troubling. \" aclu's technology director calls it \" runaway surveillance, \" per the bbc. The fbi says the technology could be crucial in helping track down criminals. In the search for an escaped prisoner, for example, officers could use iris scanners to check people at a roadblock. But no privacy impact assessment has been submitted \" as a way of anticipating and mitigating possible overreach, \" reports the verge; officials say one should be complete by september, per mashable. \" it is deeply concerning \" that this data is collected \" without public debate, proper safeguards, or even awareness that such data has been taken and is being stored, \" says privacy international. \" if our biometric data is to be collected at all, such systems should not be introduced or continued before a public debate, strong legal frameworks, and strict safeguards are in place. \"",

        "summary": "What's the first thing you do when you see a \" do not touch \" sign, in all caps, on a piece of nasa \" critical space flight hardware \"? if you're mike pence, you proceed to touch it, obviously. Per gizmodo, a picture taken by photographer mike brown for reuters shows the vice president encountering the hands-off gear thursday during a visit to kennedy space center, with the sign prominently displayed on the device, then going right ahead and laying his hand on it anyway. No one's yet received an answer from the pence camp as to why the vp — who was perhaps told too many times as a kid to stay away from hot stoves, or maybe not enough — couldn't resist such tactile temptation. No matter the actual reason, the internet came quick with the memes, joking that pence wanted to handle a glowing orb just like trump had, or could simply be easily distracted by shiny objects. Others, meanwhile, ventured into slightly darker territory, referencing pence's \" white privilege \" and his alleged refusal to dine with women other than his spouse. \" suddenly i understand why he won't have dinner with a woman who isn't his wife, \" one user tweeted, with another commenter noting the machine itself looked \" appalled. \" it could've just been that pence got carried away in the moment, which came shortly after he gave a spirited speech to nasa employees in which he proclaimed \" we will put american boots on the face of mars \" and that \" under president donald trump, american security will be as dominant in the heavens as we are here on earth. \"",

That's because there are loads of photos of flight attendants posing for snapshots in jet engine wells — a show of solidarity for attendant ericka paige diehl, who's in hot water for taking such a photo at o ' hare airport, reports wls. A passenger who saw her do it before the flight contacted wls to ask if it was legal. When diehl came aboard, someone got her name, looked her up online, and saw she had posted those tarmac pictures to her facebook page. The photos, as well as her entire facebook page, have since been scrubbed, the station notes. A chicago department of aviation rep tells wls that anyone on the tarmac has to be \" properly badged and/or under escort. \" and, per abc news, when spirit airlines got wind of the situation, it issued a statement that said, \" the activity portrayed in the photo absolutely goes against spirit policy. \" a spokesman says an investigation is underway. But fellow professional fliers are supporting diehl, saying such photos are a time-honored tradition. \" i have a picture in a jet engine, and pretty much everybody that i know that has been a flight attendant … it's just one of those things that we like to do, \" an ex-flight attendant tells abc. Another tweets: \" the photo of the flight attendant in the engine isn't a problem. We all take them. The time that she decided to take it could be an issue. \"",

        "summary": "Aaron persky, the judge widely condemned for his lenient ruling in the stanford rape case, has been abruptly removed from a new sexual-assault case. District attorney jeff rosen says he lost confidence in persky after he took the unusual step of ending a misdemeanor mail theft case midtrial on monday, dismissing the case before the jury had a chance to deliberate, the san francisco chronicle reports. Rosen says that after the puzzling move — and \" recent events \" — authorities decided they lacked faith in persky to \" fairly participate in this upcoming hearing in which a male nurse sexually assaulted an anesthetized female patient. \" the case is believed to be the first one persky had been assigned to since he sentenced brock turner to six months in prison, sparking outrage and calls for his recall, reports nbc san francisco, which notes that persky automatically won a new six-year term last week because he ran unopposed. Reuters reports that stacey capps, chief trial deputy for the da's office, says the new sexual-assault trial has been assigned to a different judge. The case involves a male nurse accused of touching the vagina and breast of a woman before surgery at a santa clara hospital, and capps says the fact that the victim is \" particularly vulnerable \" played a role in persky's removal. ( would-be jurors refused to serve on the jury under perksy in the stolen mail case. )",
