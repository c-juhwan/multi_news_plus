They're calling the virus \" careto \" ( meaning \" mask \" or \" ugly face \" ), because the word crops up in some of the code. The hackers ' professionalism and care in covering their tracks \" make us believe this could be a state-sponsored operation, \" the researchers write. Computers are infected via spearphishing emails, which point users to seemingly innocuous links to reputable sites like youtube or the washington post. Once the device — be it pc, mac, or even smartphone — is infected, the unwitting user is quickly redirected to the site they assumed they were clicking on. The virus has been most active in morocco and brazil, followed by the uk, spain, france, switzerland, libya, the us, and iran. Kapersky identified a paris-based firm called vupen as being responsible for one of the exploits the mask employs. Vupen discovered the flash flaw in a 2012 hacking competition, but, in a controversial move, chose not to reveal it, saying it would sell it instead. Asked about the revelation, the company told reuters, \" believe it or not, but there are many other companies selling \" such exploits.",

The particulars: roberts, 77, owns a home near dc in alexandria, va., and that's where he spends nearly all his time. He also owns a home in dodge city, kansas, but he's rented that out to tenants for years. When he does go back to kansas for business, he stays at the home of friends and pays them $ 300 a month to do so. That's the address listed on his voter registration. The premise of the story by jonathan martin is that roberts faces a primary challenge this year and is suddenly \" desperate to re-establish ties to kansas and to adjust his politics to fit the rise of the right in the state. \" that is, he wants to avoid the fate of tea party victim dick lugar. The roberts camp has lashed back at the article as a \" hit piece \" that distorts the facts, notes politico. But at the conservative hot air, blogger allahpundit isn't exactly brimming with sympathy for roberts, and he proposes this \" modest \" idea for lawmakers: \" either they're capped at three terms in either chamber or they can run as much as they like but need to prove that they're physically present in their home state for at least half the year.

The newspaper first asked state police to hand over the documents in january 2014; when that didn't happen, it went to the state freedom of information commission, which greenlighted their release in may 2014, reports the newtown bee. The state appealed, and on friday, superior court judge carl j. Schuman overturned that ruling, and his reasoning was thus: connecticut statutes hold that private property seized via search warrant and not used in a criminal trial be returned to the owner at the conclusion of the case; this trumps the foia. The courant points out that no one has voiced a privacy concern in relation to the documents, but schuman said his ruling must apply to similar situations less \" unusual \" than lanza's. As for what's known of the documents, they include lanza's handwritten notes, a spreadsheet that tracked the details of mass killings, and \" the big book of granny. \" a november 2013 courant article written upon the release of the state police's summary of its nearly year-long investigation shared details of the eight-chapter book, which featured a gun-slinging granny, her son, and dora the beserker. In the book, written as a school project with another classmate when the two were fifth-graders, granny robs a bank, kills soldiers, wipes out the beatles, and threatens to murder schoolkids.

Netflix already has a similar deal with the uk's virgin media, but as reuters notes, a move into the us market would be a big deal, because netflix has generally been seen as an enemy of pay-tv here. However, at a conference last week, its ceo said that cable was \" the natural direction for us in the long term, \" because it could rival time warner's hbo. Still, it isn't a done deal yet. The journal reports that many cable providers have been reticent to adopt the special technology netflix says is imperative to making its content stream smoothly. Others are concerned that netflix would use its service as a \" trojan horse \" to offer things like pay-per-view movies that would compete with the cable provider's other offerings.

Cosby's lawyers, who want his criminal sexual assault case dismissed before his april retrial, say in court papers thursday that prosecutors only recently informed them of an interview last year with a woman who cast doubts on andrea constand's allegations that cosby drugged and molested her in 2004. They also say detectives destroyed their notes from the interview. The woman, marguerite jackson, says constand told her of a plan to falsely accuse a \" high-profile person \" so she could sue and get money, per a court affidavit. At cosby's first trial, resulting in a hung jury, the judge blocked jackson's testimony, and cosby's attorneys have asked that she be allowed to testify in the upcoming trial. The two women worked together at temple university, and jackson says that a tv news report about a celebrity accused of drugging and assaulting women prompted constand to claim that something like that had happened to her, per philly.com. She then said she wasn't actually assaulted, but added, \"i could say it happened, file charges, and get money to go to school and open a business, \" according to the affidavit.

Speaking shortly after his arrival in uganda, netanyahu praised israel's commando raid on the airport that freed israeli hostages from a hijacked plane, reports ap. \" international terrorism suffered a stinging defeat, \" he said of the mission in july 1976. The entebbe rescue is a seminal event in israeli history and is widely seen as one of the country's greatest military successes. It also was a monumental event for netanyahu, as the death of his brother, yonatan, pushed him into the public eye and on a track that would take him to the country's highest office. Yonatan netanyahu was struck by a bullet as he led israeli commandos in the rescue mission. \"often i have to dispatch people to places where if there's a failure, they won't come back, \" netanyahu tells the new york times in an interview about the late yonatan. \"it's in times like these that i consult with my brother — and they're a lot more frequent than you might think. \" israel's success in the raid humiliated then-ugandan president idi amin. Four decades later, uganda has good relations with israel, which is courting allies to counter palestine's rising influence at the united nations. But netanyahu says the raid, in which three hostages were killed, remains personal. \" entebbe is always with me, \" he says. \" it is deep in my heart. \"",

            "On june 27 of that year, palestinian and german terrorists hijacked an air france flight from tel aviv to paris with more than 200 passengers. It was an era of hijackings: benjamin netanyahu, also in sayeret matkal, had been wounded during the freeing of a hijacked plane in israel in 1972. But the terrorists had learned from that one. This time they had the jet flown farther away than they thought the israelis could ever reach, to the main airport in entebbe, uganda, which was in the grip of one of the most destructive and cartoonish characters to ever rule in africa, idi amin. Amin, who called himself the uncrowned king of scotland and the \"lord of all the beasts of the earth and fishes of the seas, \" had recently thrown in his lot with the arab world, and he dispatched his soldiers to surround the hostages at the entebbe airport. The israelis, at first, were inclined to meet the terrorists'demands and free dozens of prisoners. It seemed impossible to stage a rescue. Uganda was more than 2,000 miles away. Few of israel's planes had that range, and if anything went wrong, there was no backup. This was before cellphones and satellite images became ubiquitous: the israelis did not even know how many ugandan soldiers were guarding the airport or exactly",

Speaking shortly after his arrival in uganda, netanyahu praised israel's commando raid on the airport which freed israeli hostages from a hijacked plane. \" international terrorism suffered a stinging defeat, \" he said of the mission in july 1976. The entebbe rescue is a seminal event in israeli history and is widely seen as one of the country's greatest military successes. It also was a monumental event for netanyahu, as the death of his brother, yonatan, pushed him into the public"

            "On june 27 of that year, palestinian and german terrorists hijacked an air france flight from tel aviv to paris with more than 200 passengers. It was an era of hijackings: benjamin netanyahu, also in sayeret matkal, had been wounded during the freeing of a hijacked plane in israel in 1972. But the terrorists had learned from that one. This time they had the jet flown farther away than they thought the israelis could ever reach, to the main airport in entebbe, uganda, which was in the grip of one of the most destructive and cartoonish characters to ever rule in africa, idi amin. Amin, who called himself the uncrowned king of scotland and the \"lord of all the beasts of the earth and fishes of the seas, \" had recently thrown in his lot with the arab world, and he dispatched his soldiers to surround the hostages at the entebbe airport. The israelis, at first, were inclined to meet the terrorists'demands and free dozens of prisoners. It seemed impossible to stage a rescue. Uganda was more than 2,000 miles away. Few of israel's planes had that range, and if anything went wrong, there was no backup. This was before cellphones and satellite images became ubiquitous: the israelis did not even know how many ugandan soldiers were guarding the airport or exactly",

She awoke to a man holding a knife to her throat. The woman had no idea that the man, lance blanchard, was a convicted sexual predator who lived in the building and was deemed a \" significant risk \" by police, reports the edmonton sun. But she soon learned what he was capable of. She was dragged to his apartment, sexually assaulted, and stabbed before she was able to make a 911 call. But a year later, in 2015, the unidentified woman was led into court to testify against him while in chains. \" i ' m the victim and look at me, i ' m in shackles, \" the woman told alberta judge raymond bodnarek, per the cbc. \" aren't you supposed to commit a crime to go to jail? \" during her first day of testimony, the woman had difficulty answering questions and repeatedly fell asleep. Citing a law regarding uncooperative witnesses, bodnarek ordered that she be held in custody. Days later, she begged to be released, but the judge refused, promising she would be kept away from blanchard, who was held at the same facility. Instead, at least twice over her five nights in custody, she was taken to court in the same prisoner transport van as her attacker. When blanchard was eventually convicted of aggravated sexual assault and other crimes, a judge described the woman's treatment as \" appalling. \" by that time, she was dead, a victim of an accidental shooting. Alberta's justice minister says an investigation into her treatment is now underway.",

' and he ran away and came back with a card that said ' you, ' and i knew what was happening and i just started crying, \" she recounted. \" and then he came out with a card that said ' marry, ' but it was spelled ' mary, ' and the last time donnie came out with evan and evan's shirt said ' me? ' and he was holding the ring. He asked, ' will you marry me? ' \" after mccarthy said yes, 11-year-old evan whooped, \" i have another dad! \" and everyone started crying, she said. No date has been set, but the pair, dating publicly since july, could wed as soon as august, she said. Mccarthy was also in the news over the weekend, after she wrote an op-ed clarifying that she's \" not anti-vaccine, \" she simply thinks vaccines are a \" gray area \" and she questions \" the ' one size fits all ' philosophy of the recommended vaccine schedule. \" that's not good enough, however, for many critics who quickly hit back. ( in less happy celebrity romance news, tori spelling and dean mcdermott have publicly acknowledged mcdermott's cheating — and mcdermott says he's trying to save their marriage. )",

            "[ editor's note: this article was updated with additional information. ] sunday's ( jan. 28 ) bruno mars-loving grammy awards took a steep ratings spill, fetching the smallest demo audience in the show's history. The telecast, which ran a bloated three-and-a-half hours, was off by 24 percent from 2017 with adjusted numbers. With time zone adjustments taken into account, the telecast averaged 19.8 million viewers and a 5.9 rating among adults 18-49. The second stat marked a low for the show. Among total viewers, that number was down even more than overnight returns from nielsen media that it a 12.7 rating among households. It's the biggest drop for the grammys since the 2013, the year after the show swelled following the death of whitney houston. The 2017 overnight ratings for the grammy awards didn't paint the most accurate portrait of their year-over-year performance.

            "[ editor's note: this article was updated with additional information. ] sunday's ( jan. 28 ) bruno mars-loving grammy awards took a steep ratings spill, fetching the smallest demo audience in the show's history. The telecast, which ran a bloated three-and-a-half hours, was off by 24 percent from 2017 with adjusted numbers. With time zone adjustments taken into account, the telecast averaged 19.8 million viewers and a 5.9 rating among adults 18-49. The second stat marked a low for the show. Among total viewers, that number was down even more than overnight returns from nielsen media that it a 12.7 rating among households. It's the biggest drop for the grammys since the 2013, the year after the show swelled following the death of whitney houston. The 2017 overnight ratings for the grammy awards didn't paint the most accurate portrait of their year-over-year performance. The 16.0 rating among households, steady with 2016, ended up translating to a not-insignificant gain of 1 million viewers.

        "summary": "Today's historic arguments before the supreme court over whether gay marriage is a constitutional right have wrapped up, but anyone looking to predict the winner seems to be out of luck. As expected, the court's liberal justices backed the idea and its conservative justices were skeptical, leaving all eyes on anthony kennedy as the expected swing vote. But as the washington post notes, he asked tough questions of both sides. \" this definition has been with us for millennia, \" he said of marriage between a man and a woman. \" and it's very difficult for the supreme court to say, ' oh, well, we know better. ' \" and yet he also wondered why gay couples should be deprived of the \" same ennoblement \" that marriage provides. The bottom line for those who went into today's proceedings confident of a win for gay marriage is that \" kennedy's vote is no sure thing, \" writes mark joseph stern at slate. Proponents also hoped to win over chief justice john roberts, and that, too, remains possible but murky. He voiced concern about shutting down debate on gay marriage with a court ruling, notes the new york times. But he also observed, \" if sue loves joe and tom loves joe, sue can marry him and tom can't. Why isn't that a straightforward question of sexual discrimination? \" that suggests he might join to strike down gay-marriage bans on the narrower issue of gender discrimination rather than sexual orientation, observes the roundup at bloomberg. The court is expected to rule on the case, obergefell v. Hodges, by the end of june.",

        "summary": "When a pair of college roommates were cleaning up after a party, there were bottle caps everywhere, so they picked them up with a magnet. Fast forward a few years, and the two have turned the magnet trick into a simple $ 60 invention — and they've sold $ 500,000 worth of the things, the chicago tribune reports. The device is called dropcatch, and it involves a bottle opener attached to a piece of wood containing a magnet. When partiers open their bottles, the caps drop right onto the wood, and they stay there. Joe walsh, who invented the device with university of illinois buddy kent frayn, says dropcatch can hold 60 bottle caps. Each cap ends up magnetized itself, so that it can hold the next one. \" it's a conversation piece, \" walsh, 24, notes. The two worked other jobs after college, but eventually decided to see if they could fund their project on kickstarter: \" never again will a bottle top be lost to the black abyss under your sofa, \" they proclaim on the site. They aimed for $ 10,000 in funding, which they managed within 36 hours, walsh notes. They now have an assembly shop in chicago; their site proudly proclaims \" made in the usa. \" ( in other new inventions for your kitchen, \" smart chopsticks \" identify food you won't want to eat. )",

William danielczyk and eugene biagi, who are accused of illegally funneling $ 150,000 of corporate cash into clinton's 2008 campaign, argued that the transaction should be legal, because corporations have the right to free speech. But the court today refused to take the case, bloomberg reports, and in so doing declined to expand on the citizens united decision. The court rejected several other cases today as well. In one notable case, it refused virginia's appeal in the case of a man whose iq was deemed too low to execute, the ap reports. A lower court had ruled that leon winston, who was convicted of shooting a pregnant woman in front of her daughters, was mentally disabled, and that his attorneys didn't do enough to try to prove that.

        "summary": "Not yet mastered the art of cooking a thanksgiving turkey? neiman marcus can help you out — for a price. As part of its christmas book of fantasy gifts, the department store chain is offering a \" holiday turkey dinner \" for $ 495 plus shipping, complete with a 12-pound roast turkey, gravy, stuffing, soup, salad, bread pudding, bread, and butter. The fancy feast may seem, um, a tad overpriced given that the average thanksgiving dinner for 10 people cost $ 50.11 last year, reports kdvr. But it's the add-ons in particular that have ruffled twitter users. For $ 80 plus $ 18 shipping you can also get baked beans, while three pounds of frozen collard greens with bacon ( now sold out ) cost $ 66 plus $ 15.50 shipping, report npr and the washington post. Collard greens are what eater calls a \" value vegetable, \" selling for as little as $ 2.63 per pound in grocery stores, per us weekly. At such a high price, neiman marcus'version \" better taste like unicorn tears and prince's bath water, \" the root quips in a tweet. But the fact that neiman marcus chose to include bacon in its greens is also a matter of contention as the dish is traditionally made in the south with ham hocks or smoked meat. A cookbook author accuses neiman marcus of being oblivious to \" the cultural nuances behind greens. \" she adds, \" i've heard people from the south say that they were ashamed that their family cooked collard greens. \" ( check out some of last year's fantasy gifts. )",

So far, things are looking positive. Usa today calls the s8 and s8 plus \" fast, sturdy, good looking. \" and wired decrees them \" pretty dope. \" perhaps most promisingly, samsung has completely changed the way it tests and inspects its batteries after what happened with its doomed note 7. The first thing that jumps out about the s8 and s8 plus are the screens, which are super big, take up 83 % of the phone's face, and wrap slightly around its edges. Some other features: the phones can be unlocked using facial recognition software, can survive 30 minutes underwater, and can be converted into a desktop computer by attaching a dock, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. T-mobile says the s8 will be the fastest phone on its network. And the phones mark the debut of bixby, samsung's version of ai assistants like alexa and siri. There has, however, been one bad omen raising the specter of the combusting note7: cnet reports a samsung store in singapore caught fire the day before the debut of the s8 and s8 plus.

The suit asks that trinitysun end its use of the fruit stripe name, along with \" confusingly similar \" marks, words, designs, and other names. \" i had a flavor that was labeled as fruit stripe gum, they asked me to remove that, and i did, \" trinitysun president dave miller responds.

Walgreen is joining the aon hewitt exchange, also used by sears and darden restaurants ( olive garden, red lobster ), though it will call its own marketplace the \" living well benefits store, \" reports forbes. In a fairly impressive piece of spin, a company rep says walgreen is actually doing both the employees and america a favor: \" i think the only way to drive down costs in the health care space is to have the consumer buying the health care be knowledgeable and educated and understand what they are buying, \" he says, per the ap. But critics of the approach say private exchanges allow employers to lock in the amount of money they pay, then tell staff to \" go buy their own health care \" without necessarily agreeing to increase that amount or respond to inflation in the future, forbes reports.",

She wasn't sure who the father was, but was informed she couldn't get aid from the state unless she named one. So she put down alexander on the welfare application; he had no clue. A court order demanding he pay child support was issued; a summons that he appear in court was delivered to his home, according to records from the late ' 80s. Except he never got it, reports 7 action news, which confirmed alexander was in prison on the date on record. As he tells the news station, \" i had no knowledge that i had a child support case against me. \" he ultimately learned there was a warrant out for his arrest during a traffic stop in 1991, cnn reports. Alexander says the court told him he owed $ 60,000 — and that it was too late to get a dna test. He eventually did, which proved what the child's mother says she knew — alexander wasn't the dad. She asked the court to wipe away the debt, but it only agreed to forgive the child support that was earmarked for her. The $ 30,000 portion for the child is still owed by alexander to the state. He won't pay up, and is being threatened with prison. \" i feel like i ' m standing in front of a brick wall with nowhere to go. \" ( in another strange case, a man raped at age 14 has been ordered to pay child support. )",

        "summary": "The white house said wednesday that president donald trump's proposed washington meeting with russian president vladimir putin had been delayed until 2019, citing the ongoing probe into russian interference in the 2016 election. Putin had already sent signals that the fall white house meeting wasn't going to happen, the ap reports. National security adviser john bolton said in a statement that trump believed his next meeting with putin should take place \" after the russia witch hunt is over, \" a reference to special counsel robert mueller's investigation. Bolton said they agreed the meeting would be \" after the first of the year. \" while the statement signaled optimism that the mueller probe would be completed by the end of this year, no timetable has been given for when it will be wrapped up and it could very well stretch into 2019. The white house said last week that trump had directed bolton to invite putin to visit washington in the fall, moving quickly for a follow-up meeting amid the backlash over trump's performance at a news conference with putin following their helsinki summit last week. Many members of congress had objected to the two leaders meeting again in the fall and also said putin would not be welcome on capitol hill. The decision came days after the white house rejected a putin-backed effort to hold a referendum in eastern ukraine on the region's future. Secretary of state mike pompeo said wednesday, prior to the announcement, that the us would never recognize russia's annexation of crimea and demanded that ukraine's territorial integrity be restored. The statement was released shortly before pompeo appeared before the senate foreign relations committee, where he testified he has personally told top russian officials that there will be \" severe consequences \" for any interference in us elections or the american democratic process.",

            "Update: this post has been updated to reflect the correction appended at end. Burns -- as state troopers trained their guns on robert \" lavoy \" finicum along a secluded eastern oregon highway, he reached twice for a pocket that police say contained a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun. That's when they fatally shot finicum, a video released thursday by the fbi appears to show. Read fbi statement the federal agency played the video in an attempt to dispel rumors about the circumstances of finicum's death two days earlier as he and other leaders of the armed standoff at the malheur national wildlife refuge were driving to a meeting. Conflicting accounts of his shooting fueled outrage among supporters of the refuge occupiers and prompted the leader of a northwest militia group to issue a call for members to report to burns. Greg bretzing, a special agent with the fbi, said the footage provides an \" honest and unfiltered view \" of what happened. The grainy video, taken from an fbi plane flying above the traffic stop where finicum died tuesday, depicts a dramatic scene that lasted several minutes and included a short high-speed chase.

Bill walker. As the alaska dispatch news reports, walker yesterday intervened to plead for the lives of the quintet, which were set to be euthanized, by asking the state fish and game commissioner if there was another solution. \" i ' m sure there will be plenty of criticism about the governor getting involved in this, \" walker said. \" but i ' m a person too. I have a soft spot for individuals in circumstances not of their own making. \" the bears will now likely be trapped and transported about 60 miles away, so as to inhibit their return. \" i ' m here in juneau being inundated with budget issues and having to say no to all these programs, \" walker continues. \" i felt these bears had done nothing wrong and just thought it was the right thing to do. \" speaking of those budget issues, the fish and game chief says it won't be too pricey to move the bears — but don't expect relocation to replace euthanasia as the norm. \" there are a lot of bears so it would be expensive if you had somebody doing it full time, \" he says. Both men underscore that it was a request from walker that resulted in \" a collective decision, \" per ktuu, not an order.",

Bill walker and the department made a collective decision today to instead relocate the bears, \" officials wrote. According to the release, relocating bears has not always been a good option. A trash-eating bear that was killed last year on the university of alaska anchorage campus, had previously been relocated to a remote area near eklutna, though she returned to anchorage with her cubs, shortly after. Original story: a family of trash-eating bears that made headlines as they traipsed around government hill is getting a stay of execution from alaska's governor. Department of fish and game officials said earlier this week there was no choice but to kill the five black bears that have been wandering around the anchorage neighborhood due to the cost involved with relocation, potential diseases that may result, and the complexities of finding a welcoming home. However, gov. Bill walker said saturday from the capitol — amid the frenetic close to the 90-day lawmaking session — that he found a minute to contact fish and game commissioner sam cotten to instruct them to take another approach. Walker said he was concerned when he saw news reports that the bears could be put down. \"i've been following it, watching it, \" he said. \"i just think this is the season that we can give them another try elsewhere. I really didn't think the bears had done anything wrong. \" grace jang, the governor's spokeswoman, said the department will make another attempt to relocate the animals but will keep public safety as the top priority.

        "summary": "One of the facets of the gop tax bill now signed into law is the tax break given to corporations, with the rate lowered from 35 % to 21 %. But goldman sachs says it won't capitalize as much as everyone thinks from the new bill, noting it will take a hit from a tax abroad that will slash profits this year by about $ 5 billion, per bloomberg and reuters. In a friday filing, the company says a good portion of the hit it will take is tied to a repatriation tax that now requires companies with overseas income kept as cash to pay a 15.5 % tax on it ( other holdings face an 8 % tax ); the old law allowed firms to hold off on paying taxes until that income was brought back to the us. Still, this news didn't stop top execs at the company from being awarded about $ 100 million in stocks early due to the new bill, which is still expected to make goldman sachs money overall from the changes, the hill notes. Meanwhile, sen. Marco rubio seems to be having a bit of buyer's remorse after initially giving his thumbs-up to the bill, per the hill. Rubio sat down with the news-press on friday and said if he \" were king for a day, \" the bill wouldn't look the same, and that republicans \" probably went too far on [ helping ] corporations. \" \" by and large, you're going to see a lot of these multinationals buy back shares to drive up the price, \" he said. \" some of them will be forced, because they're sitting on historic levels of cash, to pay out dividends to shareholders. That isn't going to create dramatic economic growth. \" despite these reservations, rubio still thinks there are many good things about the bill and that americans will come around once they start seeing gains in their paychecks. The new republic, however, says his concession \" contradicts every gop talking point about the tax bill. \"",

Posts on basaran's instagram page show her with her seven female friends in dubai. Authorities say the passengers were listed as six turkish citizens and two spaniards.

All three crew members were also female, including captain melike kuvvet, who was one of the first female pilots in the turkish military before she started flying private jets, the national reports. Heavy winds and rain made it impossible for helicopters to land near the crash site sunday, though authorities say the black box has now been recovered, which will make it easier to determine why the bombardier cl604 crashed, the ap reports.

The latest incident occurred when his w-2 tax form bore the number, which the bible associates with the antichrist. The number on the tax form was related to the payroll mailing sequence at contech casting, but that doesn't matter to walter slonopas: \" if you accept that number, you sell your soul to the devil, \" he tells the tennessean. When he began working for contech in 2011, he was given the number 666 to use for clocking in; he had it changed. When an alteration to the time-clock system made his number 666 three months later, he quit the job, but came back after the firm apologized. A rep for the company is \" completely at a loss for words. \" amazingly, his tale must share the title of weirdest tax-related story making the rounds: kval reports that an oregon man is suing the government and an irs agent who he claims coerced him into having sex by threatening to slap him with a 40 % tax penalty.

The president-elect has been speaking with heads of state — some say with no preparation and on personal phone lines — including a recent call with kazakhstan president ( and \" enduring dictator \" ) nursultan nazarbayev in which he called the country's \" success \" a \" miracle. \" the paper says this week's call with pakistani pm nawaz sharif has so far \" caused the most angst \" due to what white house press secretary josh earnest deems the \" quite complicated \" relationship between the two countries. The times notes the pakistani readout of that conversation left some dc diplomats thinking it was a joke. Daniel f. Feldman, a former special rep to afghanistan and pakistan, says trump's \" cavalier \" approach to the calls could be dangerous, especially those involving nuclear-armed regions. \" he's made himself not only a bull in a china shop, but a bull in a nuclear china shop, \" he notes. The white house has offered to help trump out. \" i ' m confident that as... Trump takes office, those same state department employees [ who helped obama ] will stand ready to offer him advice as he conducts the business of the united states overseas, \" earnest says. \" hopefully he ' ll take it. \" the times piece has more on how obama has carefully handled pakistan, a country he never visited as president.",

Trump's warm sentiments were surprising, given that during the campaign, he called for temporarily barring muslims from entering the united states to avoid importing would-be terrorists. His conversation with mr. Sharif also came a day after an attack at ohio state university in which a somali-born student, abdul razak ali artan, rammed a car into a group of pedestrians and slashed several people with a knife before being shot and killed by the police. Law enforcement officials said mr. Artan, whom the islamic state has claimed as a \"soldier, \" had lived in pakistan for seven years before coming to the united states in 2014. Mr. Obama never visited pakistan as president, even though he had a circle of pakistani friends in college and spoke fondly of the country. The white house weighed a visit at various times but always decided against it, according to officials, because of security concerns or because it would be perceived as rewarding pakistani leaders for what many american officials said was their lack of help in fighting terrorism. \"it sends a powerful message to the people of a country when the president of the united states goes to visit,",

And turkish officials. \" one of the surprising details of the report is that erdogan himself was taken aback at how successful he was in convincing trump on the syrian matter. Before the phone call, the consensus position that the trump administration had reached, backed by secretary of state mike pompeo and secretary of defense jim mattis, was that trump would tell erdogan to back off from his threats to attack kurdish forces in syria. But during the phone conversation, trump threw away the script and agreed with his turkish counterpart. As ap relates, trump started by reiterating the message of backing off. But then a change occurred: erdogan, though, quickly put trump on the defensive, reminding him that he had repeatedly said the only reason for u.s. Troops to be in syria was to defeat the islamic state and that the group had been 99 percent defeated. \"why are you still there? \" the second official said erdogan asked trump, telling"

Law enforcement officials said mr. Artan, whom the islamic state has claimed as a \"soldier, \" had lived in pakistan for seven years before coming to the united states in 2014. Mr. Obama never visited pakistan as president, even though he had a circle of pakistani friends in college and spoke fondly of the country. The white house weighed a visit at various times but always decided against it, according to officials, because of security concerns or because it would be perceived as rewarding pakistani leaders for what many american officials said was their lack of help in fighting terrorism. \"it sends a powerful message to the people of a country when the president of the united states goes to visit,",
            "The associated press is reporting that president donald trump's decision to withdraw troops from syria crystallized during a december 14 phone call with turkish president recep tayyip erdogan. According to the news agency, the decision was \"made hastily, without consulting his national security team or allies, and over strong objections from virtually everyone involved in the fight against the islamic state group, according to u.s. And turkish officials. \" one of the surprising details of the report is that erdogan himself was taken aback at how successful he was in convincing trump on the syrian matter. Before the phone call, the consensus position that the trump administration had reached, backed by secretary of state mike pompeo and secretary of defense jim mattis, was that trump would tell erdogan to back off from his threats to attack kurdish forces in syria. But during the phone conversation, trump threw away the script and agreed with his turkish counterpart. As ap relates, trump started by reiterating the message of backing off. But then a change occurred: erdogan, though, quickly put trump on the defensive, reminding him that he had repeatedly said the only reason for u.s. Troops to be in syria was to defeat the islamic state and that the group had been 99 percent defeated. \"why are you still there? \" the second official said erdogan asked trump, telling"

        "summary": "\" keep your movements subtle and casual. No store is free of blind spots. Find one and do your concealing there. \" these tips for shoplifting in the face of security cameras come courtesy of a so-called liftblr blog, liftblr being what good calls \" tumblr's notorious shoplifting community, \" which has been around since at least 2012. Members of the community, mostly young and female, give themselves names like unicorn-lift, princessklepto, and lifterslife. They blog about their thievery, posting photos of stolen merchandise, keeping a running tally of how much money they have \" saved, \" and providing shoplifting pointers and moral support. In trying times, according to cosmopolitan, they help their comrades work through the experience of being caught and offer advice for how to avoid detection in the future. \"it's really about sharing experiences and helping fellow lifters, \" princessklepto tells good. The lifters justify their behavior in a variety of ways: \" i kind of lift with a robin hood philosophy, \" says one. While another explains, \" i lift because i ' m poor. \" and among their guiding principles is \" thou shalt not rip off mom-and-pop shops, \" per good. Unicorn-lift, who is 15, says, \" i only lift from stores that are multi-million dollar companies \" — think sephora and victoria's secret. The lifters, good writes, are taking part in \" theft as activism, \" an idea that \" infiltrates the earliest anarchist doctrines. \" they are performing an \" anti-capitalist action, \" a researcher tells the website, whether they know it or not. Justifications aside, plenty of people are not enamored with the lifters ( including weight lifters, who use the same moniker ). Past news coverage forced many lifters into digital hiding, though a tumblr spokesman last year told tech insider that \" posts depicting potentially illegal activity \" don't necessarily violate the terms of service. According to good a new crop of lifters has emerged over the last year, with many marking their tumblrs as fictional to head off potential legal repercussions. Good has much more on the trend here.",

That includes a missouri doctor who got aroused while asking a patient if she liked being tied up and peed on, a kentucky doctor who put his mouth on a patient's vagina when he was supposed to be examining her abdomen, and a california psychiatrist who grabbed a patient's breast and ejaculated on her hand. There were examples in all 50 states of doctors of all stripes sexually abusing patients, from babies to women in their 80s. \"they're concerned only about one thing, and that's their personal gratification, \" a lawyer for one group of victims tells abc news. The journal-constitution argues the problem should be given the same level of attention as sex abuse in the catholic church. Some doctors have hundreds of victims each. An oregon doctor of the year who was called a \" great humanitarian \" by congress had 140 counts of sexually abusing patients leveled against him. He pleaded guilty to six but never saw prison. The journal-constitution was inspired to investigate after it discovered two-thirds of georgia doctors disciplined for sexual misconduct were allowed to keep practicing. It was the same story in minnesota ( four-fifths ), kansas ( two-thirds ), and alabama ( three-fourths ), the new york daily news reports.

The telegraph reports that witnesses heard \"screaming \" as workers rushed to help a zookeeper in an animal enclosure, where a tiger had attacked her. \"it was a case of total panic, \" says one witness. \"there were keepers rushing about throwing about buckets of meat to try and get the tigers under control. \" visitors were led away from the scene and then evacuated from the zoo. Another witness posted photos she was snapping of the zoo's tigers before the incident occurred to facebook, where she wrote, \"well we've just had to hide thinking a tiger was loose. Something has gone wrong with a keeper and a tiger. \" according to the independent, social media posts claiming that animals escaped began circulating, but police later refuted those accounts. The zoo released a statement calling the incident a \"freak accident \" and reiterating that no animals escaped their enclosures and that visitors were never in danger. Police also reported that the tiger was alive, in response to twitter users concerned over the fate of the animal ( last year protests erupted online when a zoo's gorilla was put to death for attacking a boy ). No further information about the zookeeper has been released, and the zoo said employees are too distraught over the incident to talk at this time. \" our thoughts and sympathies are with our colleagues, friends, and families at this dreadful time, \" the zoo's statement says.",

Strict gun-control policies have failed to deliver on their essential promise: that denying law-abiding citizens access to the means of self-defense will somehow make them safer. This should come as no surprise, since gun control has always been about control, not",
            "Two years ago, in ﻿﻿district of columbia v. Heller, the supreme court took the unprecedented step of ruling that the second amendment guarantee of the right to bear arms was an individual right rather than a right tied to a \"well-regulated militia. \" today, in mcdonald v. City of chicago, it ruled 5-4 that state and local governments are as bound by that interpretation as the federal government, a step that greatly restricts their ability to legislate in that arena. Symbolically, the ruling is a big victory for the gun lobby. But its practical effect is another matter. A decade or two ago, when hot political battles were still being fought over gun control, rulings such as these would have had significant impact. But the truth is that the single-minded passion of gun-rights advocates long routed their opponents in the political arena, making gun-control arguments in the political arena all but moot."

        "summary": "One of the most common questions being asked wednesday is how pollsters and pundits managed to be so wrong about donald trump. Well, not everybody was wrong: the los angeles times/university of south california tracking poll consistently had trump in the lead through the final months, often to much derision. As usa today notes, of 61 polls tracking a two-way race since october, only six put trump in the lead — and all were from the la times/usc. ( but even the la times ' own electoral map predicted a landslide for clinton on the eve of the election. ) back in september, american university history professor allan lichtman predicted a trump victory based on a system that involves 13 true/false statements. One caveat: lichtman's system predicts the winner of the popular vote, and trump may yet lose that. Still, coming into this year, he's been perfect since 1984. In september, he spoke to the washington post. Stony brook political science professor helmut norpoth predicted trump would be the next president. He says his model, which assesses candidates ' performances in the primaries, would have gotten every election right since 1912 except for 2000. See the new york post. Two other tracking polls that consistently had trump performing better than in most national surveys were from rasmussen reports and investor's business daily, reports politico. On monday, an outfit called the democracy institute published a poll with trump up 5 points and \" poised for electoral college win. \" the institute's press release that day boasted that its public poll was the only one to get brexit correct. Stats guru nate silver managed to be both right and wrong in a sense. His final assessment at fivethirtyeight gave clinton a 71 % chance of victory, but he also pushed back hard against polls calling her a shoo-in and observed sunday that she was \" one state away from potentially losing, \" notes the washington post. In other words, he covered his \" backside, \" writes dana milbank.",

Others are considering nixing the bans, considering the arguments of those who say \" breed-specific legislation, \" or bsl, doesn't cut down on dog bites and has killed millions of dogs — some of them not even pit bulls — that may have acted aggressively because of their upbringing, not their genes. Those who don't support bsl include the american veterinary medical association, the humane society, the national canine research council, and even the obama administration. That's not to say everyone is ready to welcome these dogs back with open arms: colorado residents in aurora voted to keep their ban, the aurora sentinel reported earlier this month; miami-dade county upheld its ban in 2012, per usa today. Even some branches of the us armed forces have banned \" dangerous dogs \" — including pit bulls and rottweilers — from base because of \" unreasonable risk, \" the founder of dogbites.org told the ap earlier this year. Perhaps no one feels as strongly about keeping the bans in place as wisconsin's jeff borchardt, whose 14-month-old son was mauled to death by pit bulls last year. \" there's this pro-pit-bull movement that tries to paint these dogs as nanny dogs and sweet, lovely, and kind, \" he tells usa today. \" it's dangerous and it's irresponsible. \" ( fifty pit bulls were recently rescued in a dogfighting raid. )",

But once he fell in and drowned, well, lesson learned, and he wasn't around to cause anyone else any grief. But the modern-day people who suffer from the disorder named after him? they're a whole different matter. Narcissists are alternately preening, entitled, aggressive, greedy, insensitive, vain, unfaithful, dishonest, lethally charming ( a charm you buy at your peril ) and sexually exploitative. They may represent merely 1 % to 3 % of the general population — but that's only full-blown, capital-n narcissism, the kind formally known as narcissistic personality disorder. There are plenty of other people with lowercase, sub-clinical cases of the condition who can do all kinds of damage — and the odds are very, very good there are at least a few in your life. How can you learn to recognize a narcissist at a glance? easy, suggests a new study published in plos one: just ask them. Narcissism is typically diagnosed with a 40-item questionnaire known as the narcissistic personality inventory, or npi. ( take it here. ) the npi is a so-called forced choice test, one that asks people to choose between two generally contradictory statements such as \"i prefer to blend in with the crowd \" and \"i like to be the center of attention, \" or \"i like to have authority over other people \" and \"i don't mind following orders. \" in many cases, both qualities may apply — it's entirely possible to like to be the boss and to accept another person's authority as well. But the \"forced \" part of \"forced choice \" means you must pick the quality that more closely describes you. The lowest you can score on the npi is a zero, the highest is a 40. Average in the u.s. Is between 15 and 16, depending on age, gender and other variables. The problem with the npi is it's time-consuming and inconvenient — hardly the kind of thing you can administer on a first date to find out if you're getting mixed up with a charming louse before you accept a second date."

            "Time health for more, visit time health narcissus got a bad rap. Sure, the guy was self-absorbed — what with all that staring at his own reflection in a stream. But once he fell in and drowned, well, lesson learned, and he wasn't around to cause anyone else any grief. But the modern-day people who suffer from the disorder named after him? they're a whole different matter. Narcissists are alternately preening, entitled, aggressive, greedy, insensitive, vain, unfaithful, dishonest, lethally charming ( a charm you buy at your peril ) and sexually exploitative. They may represent merely 1 % to 3 % of the general population — but that's only full-blown, capital-n narcissism, the kind formally known as narcissistic personality disorder. There are plenty of other people with lowercase, sub-clinical cases of the condition who can do all kinds of damage — and the odds are very, very good there are at least a few in your life. How can you learn to recognize a narcissist at a glance? easy, suggests a new study published in plos one: just ask them. Narcissism is typically diagnosed with a 40-item questionnaire known as the narcissistic personality inventory, or npi. ( take it here. ) the npi is a so-called forced choice test, one that asks people to choose between two generally contradictory statements such as \"i prefer to blend in with the crowd \" and \"i like to be the center of attention, \" or \"i like to have authority over other people \" and \"i don't mind following orders. \" in many cases, both qualities may apply — it's entirely possible to like to be the boss and to accept another person's authority as well. But the \"forced \" part of \"forced choice \" means you must pick the quality that more closely describes you. The lowest you can score on the npi is a zero, the highest is a 40. Average in the u.s. Is between 15 and 16, depending on age, gender and other variables. The problem with the npi is it's time-consuming and inconvenient — hardly the kind of thing you can administer on a first date to find out if you're getting mixed up with a charming louse before you accept a second date."

        "summary": "\" dyslexia \" is a meaningless term that should be scrapped, two academics argue in a new book. In the dyslexia debate, julian elliott of durham university and dr. Elena grigorenko of yale say the misstep comes in searching for a blanket term with which to label children who have trouble reading. \" in every country, and in every language, a significant proportion of children struggle to master the skill of reading, \" and our instinct is to \" search for a diagnostic label... Because we believe that this will point to the best form of treatment, \" says elliott. But the authors ' five years of research — which the independent reports touched on education, genetics, neuroscience, and psychology — indicated that that approach doesn't apply in this case. Quite simply, the authors explain that two children diagnosed with dyslexia often wouldn't share the same symptoms, indicating that the intervention that might work for one could be fruitless on another, reports the telegraph. The problems exist, but the label is too inexact, they say. As elliott explains to the daily mail, \" you have a long list of symptoms, things like anxiety when reading out loud, but any kid that is learning to read might be expected to show some anxiety. You show a parent this list and they say, ' you are right, i didn't realize my kid was dyslexic. ' it is like showing someone a horoscope, they look at it and see bits of themselves in it. \" what they suggest is that the focus be put not on a search for a diagnosis — which often means subjecting children to tests that will ultimately do little to inform the kind of help they need — but on identifying reading difficulties and quickly designing an intervention plan.",

Other former top obama officials cite concerns about the accuracy of the cia's own reporting of the attacks, including death tallies. Indeed, the numbers sometimes appear murky: one strike report says seven to 10 people were killed; another notes that 20 to 22 died. And the documents identify only one of 600 people killed in the 14-month period as a civilian. That's \" just not believable, \" says a former state department adviser. Worth noting: though nbc calls its report \" exclusive, \" mcclatchy appears to have covered the same ground in april, the atlantic wire notes; newser didn't cover the story that time around.",

The recall involves approximately 2,902 vehicles located in north america, with 2,712 located in the united states and 190 in canada. The company has set up a website where drivers can check their vehicle identification numbers to see if their truck is included in the recall. If it is, their instructions are quite clear: stop driving it, now. \" we take this matter very seriously and are advising owners of these specific 2006 ford rangers to stop driving their vehicles so dealers can make repairs immediately, \" ford said. \" dealers are prepared to get vehicles directly from customers, make permanent repairs that will resolve the safety risk and provide a free interim loaner vehicle, if necessary. \"",

At least 21 deaths worldwide have been linked to the takata inflators, which can rupture and send deadly metal fragments into the driver's body. \" ford is saddened by these tragic losses and offers its sincere condolences to the drivers ' families, \" the company said. Ford had previously recalled some 391,000 rangers from various model-years, but the vehicles in the new recall are all 2006 models built at the twin cities assembly plant in minnesota from aug. 10, 2005 to dec. 15, 2005. The recall involves approximately 2,902 vehicles located in north america, with 2,712 located in the united states and 190 in canada. The company has set up a website where drivers can check their vehicle identification numbers to see if their truck is included in the recall. If it is, their instructions are quite clear: stop driving it, now. \" we take this matter very seriously and are advising owners of these specific 2006 ford rangers to stop driving their vehicles so dealers can make repairs immediately, \" ford said. \" dealers are prepared to get vehicles directly from customers, make permanent repairs that will resolve the safety risk and provide a free interim loaner vehicle, if necessary. \"",

In fact, it maintains political and economic ties with 164 nations and has embassies in 47 of them. China is, of course, its biggest trade partner by far, with india second. Pyongyang, however, has relationships of various kinds all over the globe, from supplying construction workers in the mideast to providing military training in africa. All in all, these ties have helped the north \" amass the money and technical know-how to develop nuclear weapons and missiles. \" the full breakdown is here. Other coverage: bet on it: at the washington post, conservative charles krauthammer runs through the us options in the wake of the north's icbm test, all of them unpalatable, and concludes that the most likely one, \" by far, is acquiescence. \" his damning intro: \" across 25 years and five administrations, we have kicked the north korean can down the road. We are now out of road. \" forget russia and china: if you think they will lead the charge, krauthammer explains why you're sorely mistaken. The deal they proposed this week doesn't unwind north korea's nuclear program but instead freezes nuke and missile testing, something the north has agreed to in the past and violated every single time. In exchange, the us would give up its joint exercises with south korea. Russia and china's \" dead-on-arrival proposal demonstrates that their real interest is not denuclearization. Their real interest is cutting america down to size by breaking our south korean alliance and weakening our influence in the pacific rim. \" advantage: fellow post columnist charles lane thinks the north's regime has an advantage over the us and other nations because of its singular focus on one goal: \" hold on to power, at all costs, and by any means necessary. \" tiny satellites: the key to tracking future north korean missiles — and issuing warnings — may be small, inexpensive satellites out of silicon valley. The new york times explains, noting they were first developed to count cars in target parking lots. Interceptors: the us also could try to shoot down the north's missiles with a new generation of interceptors, but the economist sees a problem: \" given the speed at which north korea's missile program is advancing, its icbms may be ready before america's new interceptors are. \" apology to tokyo: a top japanese nuclear official is walking back this comment, referring to the possibility of the north hitting",

In the book, love claims bandmate and cousin dennis wilson came to him at a recording studio in 1969 \" visibly shaken, \" people reports. \" i just saw charlie take his m16 and blow this black cat [ man ] in half and stuff him down the well, \" love recalls wilson telling him. According to the new york daily news, wilson and manson had befriended each other in the los angeles music scene, and wilson had hung out a bit at spahn ranch, where manson was setting up his commune. Love writes that wilson was too scared to tell the police what he had seen. But he believes the guilt from that decision stuck with wilson, who had problems with drugs and alcohol, leading to his death in 1983 at the age of 39. Former los angeles county prosecutor stephen kay helped get manson convicted and doesn't buy love's story. \" if it was true, i would have heard it before, \" he tells people, adding that he doesn't recall there being a well at spahn ranch. In his book, love also claims doris day potentially saved her son from manson when she convinced him to move out of a home he was renting with girlfriend candice bergen and into day's malibu beach house, the mercury news reports. The two moved out in january 1969; sharon tate and four others were killed at that home on aug. 9 of that year. ( a teen slain 46 years ago near the manson killings was ided this year. )",
