That's bk's proposal to its no. 1 rival, put forth on its mcwhopper.com, which suggests the two fast-food foes team up on sept. 21 to create a sandwich by that very name, the new york times reports. In an open invitation on the site ( and in full-page ads in the times and the chicago tribune ), burger king suggests the two industry giants \" end the beef, with beef, \" calling for \" a ceasefire on these so-called ' burger wars ' \" to create \" all the tastiest bits of your big mac and our whopper, united in one delicious, peace-loving burger. \" the stated purpose of the initiative: to raise money to donate to peace one day, a nonprofit trying to let people know about the un's international day of peace on sept. 21, the times notes. \" corporate [ activism ] on this scale creates mass awareness and awareness creates action and action saves lives, \" the founder of the nonprofit says on the mcwhopper site. The proposed location would be a pop-up shop in atlanta — \" burger king hq is in miami, mcdonald's hq is in chicago, so let's meet in the middle, \" the site notes — and employees from both teams would serve up their new sandwich together; bk has even come up with designs for packaging, uniforms, and a \" peace treaty \" printed on a napkin. What exactly those \" tastiest bits \" mentioned earlier would entail is six big mac ingredients ( including the special sauce, lettuce, and cheese ) and six from bk ( including the flame-broiled patty and pickles ), per bloomberg. Mcdonald's ceo steve easterbrook doesn't seem particularly receptive, though: in a facebook post this morning, he says he thinks the two brands could pull off a more \" meaningful global effort, \" calls out bk for comparing their business rivalry to the \" real pain and suffering of war, \" and adds a ps that notes: \" a simple phone call will do next time. \" too bad.

        "summary": "Over the past few months, amanda bynes has racked up quite a few black marks on her driving record — so many, in fact, that we haven't bothered to report them all. There was her dui arrest and that time she had to be chased down by six cop cars and a helicopter after an alleged hit-and-run, but there have also been a few other hit-and-run allegations and reports of erratic driving. She's currently facing the dui charge and two hit-and-run charges. Not surprisingly, her license was suspended, but that hasn't deterred her from driving, and over the past week things have gotten even scarier: she was pulled over sunday night for driving sans headlights, but was only given a warning despite the fact that her license had been suspended. She was photographed driving tuesday while, apparently, smoking marijuana. Witnesses say she drove recklessly, to boot. Then, last night, she got into yet another fender bender, tapping the bumper of a car in front of her while leaving a west hollywood parking lot. At this point, police are concerned bynes, 26, is going to kill someone, tmz reports. Radar adds that judge marsha revel — who also had some strict dealings with lindsay lohan — this week specifically ordered bynes not to drive, and said that if she does not appear in court later this month to discuss her recent troubles, a warrant for her arrest will be issued.",

        "summary": "Italy is no stranger to exorcisms, with half a million italians reportedly requesting them each year. The independent in 2015 reported on an exorcism of an entire town, performed via helicopter. Three years prior, the catholic diocese of milan instituted an exorcism hotline, reported the bbc. But in the wake of last month's death of rome's most famous exorcist, father gabriele amorth, who was 91, demand has outpaced available priests. Amorth's protege, 79-year-old father vincenzo taraborelli, says he performs as many as 30 exorcisms in his windowless room on any given day ( he generally does it three days per week ). But he's having trouble finding successors to help take over because they are \" scared \" and feel unprepared for a workload like taraborelli's, reports the bbc. Back in 2004, amorth told the los angeles times that \" exorcism is god's true miracle, \" and that not only was he never afraid of the devil but that, in fact, \" i can say he is often scared of me. \" but the ritual that's basically unchanged since medieval times, which involves driving out evil spirits through prayer and denunciations, is supposed to be a last resort, performed after a psychologist or psychiatrist has ruled out medical issues, the times reports. Taraborelli confirms that he \" urges \" such a visit and asks those seeking exorcisms to \" bring me their prognosis. \" when warranted and performed, people have vomited anything from metal pins and braids to wood and stones, he claims. \" we need other priests like me to meet the needs of so many families, \" he says.

        "summary": "France's tussle with the burkini was just dealt a strong blow by the country's top administrative court, which on friday overturned one resort town's ban against the full-body beachwear, the ap reports. The ruling from the council of state comes during a summer of high-profile cases along the french riviera in which cannes and more than two dozen other municipalities have forbidden muslim women to don the specialized swimsuits. In the words of the cannes mayor, the burkini is a \" symbol of islamic extremism \" that doesn't respect \" good morals and secularism \" in a country that's been hard hit by militant attacks in recent months. But the director of amnesty international's european office disagrees with this tactic, noting \" these bans do nothing to increase public safety, but do a lot to promote public humiliation, \" per the bbc. The council of state heard arguments from lawyers for two human rights groups who noted that mayors in the towns that have nixed the burkinis don't have the right to tell women what to wear. Protests in support of the burkini have been taking place around the world, per cnn, including a \" wear what you want beach party \" thursday held on a diy \" beach \" outside the french embassy in london. Although friday's decision refers specifically to the town of villeneuve-loubet, it's expected to set a legal precedent for other resorts that have issued the same mandate. At least one mayor — in corsica — is already saying he ' ll continue to enforce the ban, despite the court's ruling, the bbc reports.

        "summary": "The treasury department applied new sanctions tuesday intended to squeeze north korea even tighter. The sanctions were mostly against chinese and russian companies and individuals that the us accuses of conducting illegal business with pyongyang and thus helping its nuclear weapons program, reports the washington post. The big hits were against chinese firms that import about $ 500 million worth of coal from the north, as well as russian firms that deliver oil to the nation, per politico. Also of note: the us went after two companies that help north korea with an unusual but lucrative business: building statues overseas. More on that and related coverage: those statues: yes, north korea has found a niche in the statue-building biz, as a feature from the bbc explains. The statues are particularly popular in african nations, and the north gets them built by sending its laborers abroad. The new sanctions go after companies that smooth the process. The point: \"it's definitely a message to beijing and moscow they can't continue to facilitate pyongyang, \" a former senior treasury official tells the wall street journal. The same official — anthony ruggiero of the nonprofit foundation for defense of democracies — echoed the point to the new york times, saying the sanctions look \" like the beginnings of a broad pressure campaign. \" china response: soon after the treasury's move, china responded with relatively strong language, even if in diplo-speak: \" we strongly urge the us to immediately correct its mistake, so as not to impact bilateral cooperation on relevant issues, \" said a chinese embassy spokesperson, per reuters. War games: the sanctions come as the us and south korea are conducting their annual military exercises, much to the chagrin of north korea. The los angeles times has details on what goes on. Of note: they generally don't involve live artillery and are instead confined to \" command posts and computers \" as leaders prep for quick responses to complex scenarios. Testy words at un: us and north korean envoys traded accusations at a un forum tuesday, reports the ap. American robert wood said the \" path to dialogue still remains an option \" but insisted that a \" reckless \" pyongyang poses a threat to the world and warned that president trump's top priority is keeping the us safe. The north korean envoy in turn said the north had no choice but to develop its nuclear arsenal because of \" hostile \" behavior by the us.

        "summary": "President obama, and president bush before him, fought hard to make ethanol a central part of american energy. But an ap investigation finds that the program as it stands may be doing far more environmental harm than good. The effort to grow corn for fuel has meant the destruction of more conservation ground than \" yellowstone, everglades, and yosemite national parks combined \" — some 5 million acres. Billions of pounds of fertilizer have tainted drinking water, rivers, and wildlife habitats; wetlands and prairies have been ruined; and the farming process releases carbon dioxide once held in the soil. \" this is an ecological disaster, \" says an environmental advocate. In fact, some environmental groups and big oil companies are fighting on the same side against the ethanol mandate. The obama administration argues that even if such programs take a toll now, they're an investment in future renewable energy that may be cleaner. But the ap investigation indicates that the white house is taking an unrealistically rosy view of the program — boosting corn yield assumptions, for instance, to make ethanol sound as green as possible. In further ethanol news: the white house may actually be poised to reduce the amount of ethanol required in fuel blends, politico notes. A draft of an epa document set for release today suggests a drop to 2012 levels amid clashes between top special-interest groups. The ap is getting some serious flak for its investigation from the ethanol industry, which calls it \" rife with errors. \" \" there is probably more truth in this week's national enquirer than ap's story, \" says an advocate. But the ap points to government data and peer-reviewed journal articles to back its claims. For a brief overview, the ap offers up a fact sheet.",

Ramiro ramirez, chief of diplomatic security for the cuban interior ministry, told nbc news in an exclusive interview. U.s. Officials believe some kind of sonic weapon was used to attack two dozen embassy staffers and relatives between the fall of 2016 and this august, but the cubans claim they don't even have that technology — and u.s. Experts say they don't know of technology that would produce the reported symptoms. \" cuba has never produced these type of weapons, \" said lt. Col. Jorge alazo, head of the criminal division of the interior ministry. The state department pulled 60 percent of its workers out of the embassy in havana three weeks",

Cuban interior ministry's colonel ramiro ramirez, who leads a team investigating u.s. Complaints of \" attacks \" on diplomats in havana, speaks during an interview at the hotel nacional in havana, cuba, october 22, 2017. Reuters/alexandre meneghini u.s. President donald trump said last week he believed havana was responsible for 24 diplomats being harmed. Washington expelled 15 cuban diplomats and recalled more than half the u.s. Diplomatic personnel from havana earlier in october. While cuba denounced the expulsions as \"unjustified \" and accused the united states of insufficient cooperation, three interior ministry officials and a doctor heading the inquiry provided more details in an interview in havana on sunday. Cuba had deployed about 2,000 security officials and experts, from criminologists to audiologists and mathematicians, to investigate the incidents after it became aware of them in february, the investigators said. The probe has not ended but so far has failed to uncover any evidence to corroborate allegations of attacks that the united states says have caused hearing loss, dizziness, fatigue and cognitive issues for diplomatic personnel who were based on the communist-run island. \"this is slander by the"

According to the post report, an escort named nexis de los santos santana attested in an affidavit that she was paid by a lawyer to appear in a video claiming she'd been paid by the new jersey democrat for sex. In the video, \" those are my words and that is me, but it does not reflect the truth, \" she said, per the affidavit. That lawyer, in turn, says he was misled about how the tape would be used; the two said they believed it was to be used as evidence in a divorce case. The daily caller, however, asserts that neither of the women who appeared in its video exposing menendez were named nexis de los santos santana. The caller points out other flaws in the post story; for instance, it reports that de los santos identified a prominent lawyer in her video confession, but the caller said no such name was spoken in its video interview.

The president of the higher council of school programmes says the story was a \" political smear, \" trying to blame the current government for changes made decades ago. Regardless, schoolbooks will start using the new spellings in september ( though schools will still accept the old spellings as correct ). And as long as we're changing languages to make them easier for schoolchildren, we'd like to request the us government immediately recognize \" wierd, \" \" concious, \" and \" embarass \" as fine and good spellings.",

Sales of the \" luxury \" medium-bodied red wines made from merlot grapes have increased 5 % over the past year, while sales of merlots of $ 100 or more are up 8 % in restaurants, reports bloomberg. Consider, too, that a 2016 wine intelligence report found merlot to be the top varietal choice for us drinkers of all ages and you might just be forced to overthrow all preconceived notions of merlot as, well, gross. When made well, it's actually quite delicious, \" medium-bodied with velvety soft, rounded plummy fruits and none of those drying tannins associated with cabernet sauvignon, \" gus clemens writes at the san angelo standard-times. So why the bad rap? bloomberg explains merlot has always been a favorite in bordeaux, france, where it's the most planted vine. In the 1990s, americans started fancying the grape, too, prompting the number of merlot cases sold in the us to spike from 800,000 in 1990 to 20.3 million in 2000. To get in on the trend, california wineries who'd never made merlot before began to plant the grape in unsuitable soils and climates and \" overwrought, overripe, over-alcoholic and over-oaked \" merlots took over shelves, reports hour detroit. The wine's reputation further plummeted after it was bashed in the 2004 film sideways, says clemens; many of those california wineries producing mass-market swill ripped out their vines as a result. Yet experienced merlot growers kept making delicious wine, which now appears to be getting due recognition. Clemens ' advice: \" give merlot another chance. \"",

In colorado, trump is the one in the lead, nabbing 42 % of likely voters to clinton's 41 % ( libertarian gary johnson takes 13 %, the green party's jill stein 3 % ). And in pennsylvania, clinton squeaks by with 45 % to trump's 44 %, with johnson grabbing 6 % and stein holding steady at 3 %.

Before the cnn/orc polls — conducted sept. 20-25 among 771 likely pennsylvania voters and 784 colorado voters — emerged, fivethirtyeight noted sunday that clinton was \" tenuously \" ahead in the polls, including holding onto the states she needs to win the electoral college vote, but that \" trump is one string of good polls in pennsylvania or colorado or new hampshire away from erasing that advantage. \"",

The administration filed emergency applications late thursday with the us supreme court to reinstate the temporary ban on travelers from six muslim-majority countries, reports reuters. The ban has been repeatedly slapped down by other courts, most recently by the 4th circuit court of appeals, which said it suspected the ban was an attempt by trump to bring in the unconstitutional muslim ban he spoke of on the campaign trail. If the court decides to grant the emergency requests, the ban could be reinstated immediately. The decision on whether to lift the injunctions against the ban could come within two weeks, with the court hearing the full case at a later date. We are \" confident that president trump's executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism, \" justice department spokeswoman sarah isgur flores said in a statement. Politico notes that a decision to reinstate the ban will require the approval of five of the court's nine justices, and the administration's claim of it being an emergency will be undercut by the fact that it has passed up several previous opportunities to turn to the supreme court.",

        "summary": "Quick, name a ufo hot spot around the us. If northwest florida didn't come to mind, maybe it should have. As the tallahassee democrat reports, the big bend region in the state has had all kinds of sightings dating back to the 1970s. In recent years, 50 sightings in leon and surrounding counties have been reported to the nonprofit mutual ufo network. And the state as a whole is no slouch, either, with 58 reports to mufon last month out of 985 worldwide. In fact, another tracking organization, the national ufo reporting center, says only california beats florida in terms of overall sightings ( 11,542 vs. 5,385 ). So does this mean there thousands of ufos flying around? well, no, says mufon. The group investigates all reports — from weird lights to tales of alien abductions — and usually links them to airplanes, drones, sky lanterns, or hoaxes. But it says five cases in florida can't be explained. One involves charles ellison, who says he nearly crashed into a bright light while driving near pensacola in 2012. He says he slammed on his brakes and skidded sideways. Then, suddenly, he was 100 yards up the road. He says he pulled over and started walked toward the light, but got spooked and drove away. \" if i was a betting man, i would say it was something that's not of this earth. \" click for the full story, which includes details of more strange encounters.

To address this issue, state media reports that china is creating its own christian-based theology that will conform more closely with the government's way of doing things, according to the south china morning post. \" the construction of chinese christian theology should adapt to china's national condition and integrate with chinese culture, \" says a director with the country's religious affairs department. No more details were offered. There were about 67 million christians in china in 2010, or about 5 % of the population, according to the pew research center. However, the communist party allows worship only in state-sanctioned churches under the government's watchful eye. Officials have started taking aim at the many \" underground \" churches that have cropped up across the republic, as well as some of the state-approved ones: in zhejiang province — where wenzhou, the city known as \" china's jerusalem, \" is located — officials have been tearing down crosses and steeples and have ordered at least 100 church demolitions for \" zoning \" violations since the spring, reports the new york times. This battle \" has been going on for decades and will continue, \" a human-rights activist says in an email to the washington free beacon. \" the authoritarian police state cannot possibly tolerate a faith that preaches dissent from the regime's one-party rule. \"",

Though there are many claims in the news about outrageous things happening in the private screening rooms ( such as this one last year ) i've never seen or even heard of anything malicious, illicit or illegal happening in the private screening room, depending, at least, upon what one's personal definition of \"illegal \" may be, per the fourth amendment, in regards to tsa policy in general ( and yes, i ' m familiar with u.s. Vs davis 1973 for you tsa apologists reading this, your perennial go-to rejoinder ). The reason the tsa generally wants to shield the \"enhanced security screening procedures \" that transpire in the private screening room is because, of course, if the ever-present, ever-lurking, american-way-of-life threatening terrorists out there were to ever get the specifics on those state of the art procedures, then why, by god, they would possess the very key to defeating tsa's highly-sophisticated",

The unnamed ex-tsa officer, who writes for the blog taking sense away, received a note from a reader which said:'tell us, please, what really happens in that private room and why the tsa does not want it seen in public or recorded. ' in response, the blogger wrote that while he has not experienced or heard of anything outright illegal or illicit going on in the private screening rooms, officers manning the image operator ( io ) rooms where passengers ' nude x-ray images are reviewed often behave in a highly inappropriate manner.

For starters, a world treaty requires airlines to pay families up to about $ 157,000 each after the crash of an international flight, no matter what caused it, reports ap.

The act was established to tamp down on the aborting of female fetuses in the country.

Why? because he's taken on public unions. In a speech yesterday at the conservative political action conference ( aka the \" conservative woodstock \" ) in national harbor, md., walker reminded everyone of his anti-unions stance and extrapolated that to how he'd do taking on the militants wreaking havoc in iraq and syria, the guardian reports. \" i want a commander in chief who will do everything in their power to make sure the threat from islamic terrorists will not show up on our soil, \" he said. \" if i can take on 100,000 protesters, i can do the same across the world. \" walker was referring to 2011 protests in his state that demonstrated against his act 10 legislation, which effectively nixed collective bargaining for public unions, per npr. One person who didn't appreciate walker's comments, per the wisconsin state journal: wisconsin afl-cio president phil neuenfeldt. \" to compare the hundreds of thousands of teachers, students, grandmothers, veterans, correctional officers, nurses, and all the workers who came out to peacefully protest and stand together for their rights as americans to isis terrorists is disgusting and unacceptable, \" neuenfeldt said in a statement. Walker's counterpoint: \" let me be perfectly clear: i ' m just pointing out the closest thing i have to handling this difficult situation is the 100,000 protesters i had to deal with, \" he told reporters, as per the journal. \" you all will misconstrue things the way you see fit. That's the closest thing i have in terms of handling a difficult situation, not that there's any parallel between the two. \" when asked by a reporter if he regretted yesterday's statements, he simply said, \" no. \" ( and listen: walker has no clue if obama loves his country or not, so don't ask. )",

Alejandro travaglini was surfing at gracetown around 8am when he was attacked, st. John ambulance spokesman dennis bertoldo says. The argentinian-born 37-year-old was treated on the beach by paramedics before he was flown 160 miles by helicopter to a hospital in the city of perth. Friends say travaglini fought off the shark before it returned and dragged him underwater, the west australian reports. He punched it before making his way to shore, where his friends used the rope from his board as a tourniquet until help arrived. The hospital described the victim's condition as stable. The attack prompted the world surf league to postpone the nearby margaret river pro international surfing contest, where traviglini is a member of a work crew, for about an hour while shark-spotting drones were deployed, the ap reports. Surf photographer peter jovic watched the attack from the beach and likened it to the live broadcast of a shark attack in south africa in 2015. \" if anyone is familiar with the mick fanning moment... It was very similar to that, where a shark pretty much popped up and ended up knocking a surfer off his board, \" he said.

        "summary": "\" that's one thing that makes this case interesting: it asks the existential question as to when friendship ends and corruption begins. \" so says a former federal prosecutor of the corruption trial, which is kicking off wednesday, of sen. Robert menendez. The 63-year-old new jersey democrat is the first senator to face bribery charges in almost four decades, relating to political donations and free vacations from a florida eye doctor, reports the new york times. Menendez's lawyers say the gifts were simply given by salomon melgen to his close friend of more than 20 years. But prosecutors argue that menendez returned the favors by urging the department of health and human services to abandon its claim that melgen defrauded medicare of $ 9 million and pressing the state department to approve visas for melgen's girlfriends, reports nbc news. Prosecutors say menendez twice met with officials who could placate melgen's personal and business concerns on the very day that melgen donated to super pacs supporting menendez. But his lawyers say menendez was only acting on his policy views to help a political supporter. The trial could last up to two months. If convicted, menendez would likely face calls to resign, though he would be expected to delay his resignation until new jersey's next governor — likely to be a democrat, according to polls — takes office in january. If he resigns before january, gov. Chris christie would get to appoint a republican in his place, giving republicans a much-needed boost in their quest to pass new health care legislation, per the los angeles times.",

        "summary": "The divisive — and sometimes bizarre — facebook ads bought by russian operatives were on display wednesday as facebook, google, and twitter execs appeared before congressional panels for a second day. The house intelligence committee released the ads, a wide selection of which can be seen here, in what it said was an effort to show just how hard the kremlin had tried to polarize american voters before and after last year's election. The ads purchased by russia's internet research agency targeted clinton, trump, and sanders voters as people on both sides of issues like the police violence and black lives matter controversy. One ad posted the day before the election told texans to be ready to secede if \" killary rotten clinton \" won. \" my concern is that a dictator like vladimir putin abused flaws in our social media platforms to inject the worst kind of identity politics into the voting decisions of at least 100 million americans, \" said democratic rep. Andre carson, per the new york times. Facebook execs said the ads reached almost 150 million users, more than previously disclosed. Facebook reported very strong quarterly earnings wednesday, though mark zuckerberg warned that moves to boost security could cut into future profits, usa today reports. \" we're bringing the same intensity to these security issues that we've brought to any adversary or challenge we've faced, \" he said. \" i ' m dead serious about this. \" the company says it plans to double the number of security personnel to 20,000. \" what they did is wrong and we're not going to stand for it, \" zuckerberg said.",

The alarm clock? who needs one? the gps navigation system? why pay for one when you can get turn-by-turn for free? but there's something big that the smartphone, try as it might, has not been able to stare down into oblivion: pen and paper. Even as we scramble to replace our daily activities with simplified digital solutions, there's still nothing quite like writing something down. Mobile interfaces, even for the agile-thumbed, can be cumbersome. Devices like the apple ipad are popping up in more boardrooms, but anyone who tries to take notes or manage a calendar on one quickly runs into problems. The novelty factor quickly fades as men and women in suits struggle to thumb in notes during important meetings. Still, one of the most competitive app categories today is productivity and task management. It seems every week there's a hot new app that promises to streamline our digital lives, linking things like to-do lists and calendars to help keep us focused. Apple's siri digital personal assistant, baked into the iphone 4s, includes a much-hyped feature to help add reminders to a calendar. In fact, that's where this column began -- a list of the best apps to help you stay on task"

She was 53. It was her friend's 10-year-old son who was struggling in the water, reports le monde, and dufourmantelle went into cardiac arrest while trying to come to his aid. Other news outlets, including the bbc, say it was two children dufourmantelle was trying to rescue and that they were ultimately brought safely to shore by lifeguards. Swimming conditions were not good friday at the pampelonne beach with strong winds and high waves, according to television channel france 3. An orange warning flag had recently been switched to red, prohibiting people from being in the water, when dufourmantelle was overcome by the strong current. That dufourmantelle sprung into action, despite the risks, perhaps comes as no surprise. In 2011 she wrote a philosophical book called éloge du risque ( in praise of risk ). \" the idea of absolute security — like ' zero risk ' — is a fantasy.... Being alive is a risk, \" dufourmantelle told the french newspaper la liberation in a 2015 interview. \" when there really is a danger that must be",

Anne dufourmantelle entered the water after the children got into difficulty in strong winds at pampelonne beach, near st tropez, on friday. The two children were later rescued by lifeguards and were unharmed. The french culture minister, françoise nyssen, said dufourmantelle was a \" great philosopher who helped us live \". Witnesses said dufourmantelle, 53, was bathing 50m ( 164 ft ) from the two children when an orange warning flag at the beach was changed to red, indicating that bathing was prohibited due to dangerous conditions. She immediately tried to reach them but was carried away in a strong current. Attempts to resuscitate her after she was recovered failed, france 3 reported ( in french ).

            "French philosopher who promoted risk-taking dies attempting water rescue prominent french academic and author, anne dufourmantelle, who wrote about the importance of taking risks, died friday while trying to rescue a drowning child at the beach in saint-tropez. She was 53. It was her friend's 10-year-old son who was struggling in the water, reports le monde, and dufourmantelle went into cardiac arrest while trying to come to his aid. Other news outlets, including the bbc, say it was two children dufourmantelle was trying to rescue and that they were ultimately brought safely to shore by lifeguards. Swimming conditions were not good friday at the pampelonne beach with strong winds and high waves, according to television channel france 3. An orange warning flag had recently been switched to red, prohibiting people from being in the water, when dufourmantelle was overcome by the strong current. That dufourmantelle sprung into action, despite the risks, perhaps comes as no surprise. In 2011 she wrote a philosophical book called éloge du risque ( in praise of risk ). \" the idea of absolute security — like ' zero risk ' — is a fantasy.... Being alive is a risk, \" dufourmantelle told the french newspaper la liberation in a 2015 interview. \" when there really is a danger that must be",
            "Image copyright librairie mollat image caption french philosopher anne dufourmantelle, 53, said that \" life begins with risk \" a leading french philosopher who advocated risk-taking has drowned after attempting to save two children at a beach on the french riviera. Anne dufourmantelle entered the water after the children got into difficulty in strong winds at pampelonne beach, near st tropez, on friday. The two children were later rescued by lifeguards and were unharmed. The french culture minister, françoise nyssen, said dufourmantelle was a \" great philosopher who helped us live \". Witnesses said dufourmantelle, 53, was bathing 50m ( 164 ft ) from the two children when an orange warning flag at the beach was changed to red, indicating that bathing was prohibited due to dangerous conditions. She immediately tried to reach them but was carried away in a strong current. Attempts to resuscitate her after she was recovered failed, france 3 reported ( in french ). It was unclear if she knew the children involved in the incident. Her funeral is due to be held in ramatuelle, southern france, on tuesday. Dufourmantelle wrote numerous essays on the importance of taking risks and the need to accept that exposure to any number of possible threats is a part of everyday life, including the book praise of risk",

The official tells the new york times that a team of 15 saudi agents were waiting for the washington post columnist when he arrived around 1: 15pm on oct. 2, expecting to receive paperwork for his planned marriage. The official said khashoggi was beaten and tortured almost immediately after he was taken to the office of the saudi consul general, mohammed al-otaibi, who's reportedly heard on an audio recording of the slaying. Khashoggi — who was also drugged, per the wall street journal — was dead within minutes, but not before his fingers were cut off, the official said. More:",

Some recordings or other evidence may have come from intercepted communications or audio surveillance that the turkish government is unwilling to acknowledge for fear of compromising intelligence sources or revealing violations of international law. But mr. Trump's comments suggested that the turks have also declined to share their evidence with united states intelligence agencies, which are usually close partners. That reluctance suggests the turkish government may be seeking to reach some accommodation with saudi arabia while avoiding a full rupture in relations with another important regional power.

President trump suggested that he was taking the accusations seriously and sent mr. Pompeo to saudi arabia for answers. And people knowledgeable about the saudi plans said the royal court was preparing to acknowledge mr.

That's \" order-to-shelf. \" the austin business journal explains it's an inventory-management system that, as the name suggests, tries to move products from the truck right to the shelf, ideally increasing efficiency while trimming waste. But the employees say it's leading to food shortages, anxiety, crushed morale, and tears. \" seeing someone cry at work is becoming normal, \" says a west coast employee. One of the more damning quotes from a georgia employee: \" we've lost team leaders, store team leaders... And even a regional vice president.

        "summary": "Cnn reported friday that four more women have leveled allegations of sexual harassment against journalist mark halperin. The news channel said that one woman claimed halperin masturbated in her presence after she went to his abc news office to seek advice from him about her career at the news division, where she was a desk assistant. Cnn said a second woman alleged that the game change co-author threw her against a restaurant window and threatened to derail her career after she rebuffed his attempt to kiss her. The woman, who told cnn she met halperin when she was interning at the white house, said he called her shortly after the encounter and warned that she'd never be hired in media or politics. The four women, who were not identified in the cnn report, said the encounters took place between the late 1980s and 2006, during which time halperin worked at abc news in influential positions including political director. Cnn said that halperin denied that he masturbated in front of anyone or physically assaulted or threatened anyone. The latest allegations bring the number of women accusing him of sexual misconduct to about 12. Halperin issued a lengthy apology on twitter, the ap reports. He said he was \" profoundly sorry for the pain and anguish i have caused by my past actions....

As npr reports, the rare left-curling snail's story surfaced last fall when scientists at the university of nottingham made a public bid to find other left-curling snails with which jeremy could mate ( his left-curling status means he can't align sex organs, which are located on the left side of the head, with normal right-curling snails ). They found not one potential suitor, but two: lefty, a uk woman's pet, and tomeu, who was on his way to becoming a meal in spain. Scientists stuck all three in the fridge — as one does to simulate snail hibernation, apparently — then took them out in the spring to see if lefty love might come alive. It did, but it was lefty and tomeu who were furiously mating. Lefty and tomeu produced three batches of eggs, and more than 170 snails have thus far hatched, per a press release, giving scientists the answer to the question of whether left-curling snails produce left-curling snails: nope. At least not so far, notes sky news, though scientists are hoping the trait might show in future generations. But all is not lost for jeremy: lefty has since returned home, and angus davison — the uk professor who has been studying the love triangle — is hoping that jeremy and tomeu turn to each other's, er, shells? says davison, jeremy \" has since become much more lively so we continue to hope that we can do the experiment and understand the genetics of all three snails, but for the moment only two of them have reproduced. \" as \" simultaneous hermaphrodites, \" snails can do that.

        "summary": "Tony robbins has taken a lot of heat since dozens of people at one of his seminars were injured last week in dallas while walking over hot coals. But not everyone is breathing fire on the motivational guru. First, and not surprisingly, robbins'rep jennifer connelly defended the \" unleash the power within \" exercise, per nbc news, in a statement: \" seven thousand attendees successfully participated in a fire walk [ that ] has been a celebrated part of this event for 35 years. \" and while she also expressed her gratitude to emergency responders who treated what the washington post reports were 30 to 40 \" burn victims \" ( five had to be hospitalized ), she noted outside assistance really wasn't necessary, since robbins ' events always have medical personnel to treat the small percentage ( \" fewer than 1 % \" ) of attendees who may get \" hot spots \" on their feet during the hot-coal stroll. Local officials appear to back up connelly's assessment: a rep for the dallas fire department tells the post that robbins ' group had all necessary permits and that there were two fire-prevention officers, two paramedics, and a rescue unit on hand. And the director of the dallas convention center where the seminar was held notes robbins did the coal walk there two years ago \" without any incidents that we are aware of. \" but perhaps robbins'strongest defenders are those who actually attended the event, with fans praising him as \" awesome \" and insisting that attendees distracted by taking selfies and even the outside medical response may have exacerbated the problem. One gushes to nbc about robbins ' \" unique gift, \" while a six-time attendee says, \" all of a sudden you had these ambulances showing up — sirens blaring, lights blaring — and we've still got people trying to walk. \" he adds robbins ' past seminars have been \" an amazing, outstanding experience every time. \"",

The driver of the pickup was not 17-year-old carlee bollig's boyfriend, as initially believed, reports the star-tribune.

The picture prosecutors are painting is one of total disregard: carlee was in the truck with three teens who also survived; one was caysi jaronske, who told police that she told carlee to stop texting at least eight or nine times that night. Carlee allegedly told caysi she \" didn't care if she crashed, \" and to \" f --- off, \" and caysi says that as the car neared the fatal intersection, someone in the truck screamed \" red light, red light! \" what investigators found in the weeks since, per prosecutors: carlee never hit the brakes, and she used facebook messenger between 7: 49pm and 7: 57pm; the initial 911 call was logged at 7: 59pm, reports the st. Cloud times. The star-tribune reports that 10 days after the crash, caysi told police carlee and another passenger had agreed to say the boyfriend was behind the wheel because no one else in the car had a valid license. Dna evidence helped police make their determination. The st. Cloud times in august cited search warrants stating that the truck's passengers had stopped in st. Cloud for the purpose of doing drugs; synthetic marijuana and a pipe were found in the truck. Killed were charles maurer and daughter cassy, who would have been a fifth-grader this year; her 16-year-old sister and a 15-year-old friend survived.

        "summary": "The supposed mission of mattel's \" i can be \" barbie book series is to empower girls to realize their career dreams. Hence the uproar over \" i can be a computer engineer, \" which shows the iconic doll struggling to reboot her computer, then finding male coders to rescue her, consumerist reports. The random house book caught the eye of author pamela ribon — whose fiery take on the \" misogynistic \" tome was reprinted by gizmodo — and amazon reviewers, who gave the book at least 97 one-star reviews before it was yanked off the site yesterday, consumerist notes. In the book, barbie does such non-tech-savvy things as infecting her friend skipper's laptop with a virus, which causes skipper to lose her music files and homework. The two girls have a pillow fight, then barbie goes to hunt down steven and brian to help her with her computer woes. The book was written by susan marenco, who handled many \" i can be \" books and worked for microsoft for 10 years as a technical editor and \" usability designer. \" she tells abc news she thinks of herself as a feminist: \" if i was on deadline, it's possible stuff slipped out or i quietly abided by mattel without questioning it. Maybe i should have pushed back, and i usually i do, but i didn't this time. \" reaction is predictably fierce, as gizmodo notes, complete with a tumblr parody and the feminist hacker barbie site, where you can \" fix \" pages in the book to be more progressive. Mattel has apologized for the book, stating on the barbie facebook page that the book was first published in 2010, that it \" doesn't reflect the brand's vision for what barbie stands for, \" and that the book series has been revamped since then.",

        "summary": "Get ready for some electrifying concrete news. No, seriously. Upi reports researchers at the university of nebraska are developing conductive concrete that uses electricity to keep itself free of snow and ice during even the worst winter storms. Sounds like something the east coast could've used this week. The winter-defeating concrete is made with 80 % traditional asphalt and 20 % \" carbon particles and steel shavings. \" it carries enough current to heat itself to 40 degrees, according to national geographic. That's enough to melt snow and ice but not to hurt people, upi reports. Funding for the concrete comes from the faa, which hopes to use it in tarmacs. \"they said that if we can heat that kind of tarmac, then there would be ( far fewer ) weather-related delays, \" civil engineering professor chris tuan says in a press release. \" we're very optimistic. \" the idea for conductive concrete has been around for decades, and a test of tuan's design kept a nebraska bridge clear during the winter back in the early 2000s, national geographic reports. So why are we still shoveling our driveways like chumps? one expert says cost and liability concerns are to blame. Tuan has addressed that first concern by using waste from the coal and steel industries in his concrete, reducing the manufacturing cost by 60 %. And he notes that once the concrete is installed, it costs less to heat than to use salt or chemicals, according to upi. And while it's too expensive for use on entire roads, the conductive concrete could be used for busy intersections, driveways, and other \" strategic locations. \" ( yellowstone closed a road because it was melting. )",

Women's advocates say existing legislation in sudan severely limits the ability of victims of sexual violence to seek justice ( st ) according to a press statement issued by the strategic initiative for women in the horn of africa ( siha ) on thursday, the woman was sentenced to one month in prison, which has been suspended, and fined 5000 sudanese pounds ( about us$ 961 ). The woman, who was three months pregnant at the time of the attack, had been facing a possible death sentence after being charged with adultery and prostitution. However, the court accepted that the woman was divorced and thus the charges of adultery were not applied. Siha said the woman's conviction of indecent acts sends a message that sexual violence is in part the fault of the victim. \"this verdict reflects the substantial challenges in enabling victims of sexual violence to pursue justice. It will also serve to prevent future victims from speaking out and seeking assistance and entrenches a culture of impunity for perpetrators, \" hala elkarib, the siha network's regional director, said.

            "February 20, 2013 ( khartoum ) – an 18-year-old ethiopian woman who said she was gang raped by seven men in sudan has been found guilty of committing indecent acts and is also facing a possible jail term for immigration offences. Women's advocates say existing legislation in sudan severely limits the ability of victims of sexual violence to seek justice ( st ) according to a press statement issued by the strategic initiative for women in the horn of africa ( siha ) on thursday, the woman was sentenced to one month in prison, which has been suspended, and fined 5000 sudanese pounds ( about us$ 961 ). The woman, who was three months pregnant at the time of the attack, had been facing a possible death sentence after being charged with adultery and prostitution. However, the court accepted that the woman was divorced and thus the charges of adultery were not applied. Siha said the woman's conviction of indecent acts sends a message that sexual violence is in part the fault of the victim. \"this verdict reflects the substantial challenges in enabling victims of sexual violence to pursue justice. It will also serve to prevent future victims from speaking out and seeking assistance and entrenches a culture of impunity for perpetrators, \" hala elkarib, the siha network's regional director, said. It's alleged the attack",
            "An ethiopian woman who says she was gang-raped in sudan has been convicted of \" indecent acts \". The woman of 18 was three months ' pregnant at the time of the alleged attack. She was arrested after video of her allegedly being sexually abused was circulated on social media. Three men who admitted having sex with the woman and two who distributed the video were reportedly sentenced to being whipped. The three were each sentenced to 100 lashes for adultery, while two got 40 lashes for distributing indecent material, according to women's rights group strategic initiative for women in the horn of africa ( siha ). ' brutal'the woman was sentenced to a one-month jail term but this was suspended because she is pregnant, her lawyer, samia al-hashmi, told the afp news agency. She was also fined 5,000 sudanese pounds ( $ 880; £ 530 ). She had also faced charges of adultery and prostitution, which could have led to a penalty of death by stoning, but these were dropped after she convinced the court she was divorced, reports siha. The campaign group says the woman was house-hunting when she was lured to an empty property and attacked in omdurman, just across the river nile from khartoum. It says she now faces deportation. The group's regional director hala elkarib condemned the conviction,"

He placed the bet one week into the season, at 30-1 odds, and the payout is the \" largest futures bet win in sports gambling history, \" mel magazine notes. Oancea had to spread the bet around to 15 different las vegas casinos, because after winning big with sports futures bets before, no casino would allow him to place such a large bet in one go. He's banned from westgate, vegas ' biggest sports book, and the mgm grand, and he's limited at several other casinos. \" vegas loves losers but hates winners, \" he says.

That's already enough to make your jaw drop, but it may drop even further when you consider that number is 600 square feet more than the entire old mansion — which romney is tearing down in order to make room for the new mansion, huge basement and all.

The dewatering of two falls that comprise niagara falls also will provide insights into how millions of gallons of surging water cut through rock. The falls are \" spectacular aesthetically, \" university of buffalo geologist marcus bursik tells live science, \" but they're not studied a lot geologically. \" that will change if plans go ahead to build a rock and earth structure called a cofferdam that will divert water away from the two us falls — american falls and bridal veil falls — toward horseshoe falls on the canadian side. Horseshoe falls already takes 85 % of the water flowing over niagara falls, the cbc notes. Geologists would create detailed maps of the landscape that's normally hidden beneath rushing water. They plan to snap photos with airborne drones, make 3d images with stereography, and use laser ranging to see how long it takes the falls ' light to reach various satellites. Comparing new images to ones shot in 1969 ( when the two falls were last dewatered ) may reveal how water has carved the rock. Scientists can also see whether boulders have fallen over time and whether rock face bolted in 1969 to prevent toppling has held up. And what they learn may lead to a broader understanding of waterfalls in general, bursik says. The geology project is expected to take several weeks, while the waterfalls should be curbed for five to nine months. In any case, it won't happen soon: the dewatering project likely won't begin for five to seven years, a new york state parks rep tells wired.

Conservative lawmakers have derided the loan guarantee program, arguing that it's wasted billions of taxpayer dollars. Critics have pointed to the program's $ 535 million loan guarantee for solyndra, a fremont-based solar panel manufacturer that filed for bankruptcy in 2011. But the department of energy reported last year that it expects to make a profit of $ 5 billion to $ 6 billion from the program. The department funded",
            "Riverside, calif. ( ap ) — one of the nation's largest solar projects was dedicated monday in the riverside county desert, as california rushes to expand its use of green power to meet the state's renewable energy requirements. The dedication of the desert sunlight solar farm comes about a month after gov. Jerry brown called on the state to increase renewable electricity use to 50 percent by 2030, up from the current goal of 33 percent by 2020. \" solar projects like desert sunlight are helping create american jobs, develop domestic renewable energy and cut carbon pollution, \" interior secretary sally jewell said in a statement. \" i applaud the project proponents for their vision and entrepreneurial spirit to build this solar project, and commend gov. Brown for implementing policies that take action on climate change and help move our nation toward a renewable energy future. \" the plant, which uses photovoltaic panels, is expected to produce enough power for about 160,000 homes. Constructed on about 4,000 acres of federal land, it is owned by nextera energy resources, ge energy financial services and sumitomo corporation of america. First solar is building and operating the plant, the california energy commission said. Nationwide, the u.s. Bureau of land management has approved 52 large renewable energy projects since 2009, including 29 solar plants. Desert sunlight benefited from"

        "summary": "Following an initial nuclear deal between tehran and the west, iran is planning to ramp up its oil production, its oil minister says. \" we will produce 4 million even if the price drops to $ 20, \" says bijan namdar zanganeh. That's about a sixth of the current price, and it would leave production costs far higher than revenue, the ap notes. Saudi arabia, which produces about a third of opec's supply, doesn't plan to reduce production for iran's benefit, and opec doesn't look likely to raise its 30-million-barrel daily production limit, arab news notes. Still, the saudi oil minister doesn't appear worried about any potential export crisis. \" i hope iran comes back ( and ) produces all it can, \" he says, per the ap. But the nuclear deal itself may face a challenge, with republican lawmakers on the attack; some democrats, including charles schumer, have also expressed doubts. \" the overwhelming sentiment ( among house republicans is ) this was an agreement that was foolish, dangerous, and that we need to do something and push forward, \" says rep. Tom reed. The house could push the senate for new iran sanctions, or it could pass a resolution officially expressing disapproval, the hill reports. The public apparently feels differently. A poll shows that a plurality of americans who know at least \" a little \" about the agreement — some 34 % — back it.

Anyone diagnosed with gender identity disorder will also be allowed to apply for a legal gender change at 18. But 18 won't cut it when it comes to drinking alcohol, smoking, gambling, or adopting children; the legal age for those activities will remain 20.

Some 82 % of americans don't approve of the way congress is doing its job, the lowest rating since the times started asking the question in 1977. Cnn's poll gave lawmakers even lower grades, with just 14 % of respondents approving of how congress is handling its responsibilities. More than 80 % said the debt debate was more about scoring political points than doing what's best for america. The public isn't impressed with either party, but the gop fares worse in the times poll, with 72 % of those surveyed disapproving of congressional republicans ' performance versus 66 % down on the democrats. Poll respondents were more evenly split on president obama's performance in the debt talks, with 47 % disapproving and 46 % approving of how he handled the situation. Only a fifth of americans now view the tea party movement positively, the poll found, and more than two-thirds say creating jobs should be a higher priority than cutting spending.",
