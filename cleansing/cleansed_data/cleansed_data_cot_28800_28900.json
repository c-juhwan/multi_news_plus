As for the odni, which was created in 2004 to increase cooperation between intelligence agencies post-9/11, trump wants to limit its power because he believes it actually interferes with the 16 us intelligence agencies, sources tell cnn. Rep. Adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, quickly hit back at the reports: shrinking the odni would \" diminish its effectiveness and reverse many of the important gains we had made since 9/11, \" he said in a statement wednesday night. \" moreover, to propose changing the cia's operational structure because of loose allegations of politicization — claims based on nothing more than the agency's willingness to contradict the president-elect's preferred version of events — would be a mistake of the highest order. \" trump has an intelligence briefing on russian hacking friday.",

He is one of the guards who admitted falsifying records to make it appear as if rounds had been carried out. He said guards would spend time reading books and doing crossword puzzles instead of performing their duties. Some highlights from the new york state inspector general's report, per the new york times, cnn, and nbc: sweat spent 85 nights sneaking out of his cell to explore tunnels and cut an escape path with tools left behind by workmen or smuggled in by prison tailor shop employee joyce mitchell. \" in the time sweat was out of his cell over a three-month period, a total of more than 400 counts should have been conducted, \" the report states. \" if only one of the counts was done properly, the escape plan would have been instantly stopped. \" mitchell, who was sentenced to up to seven years for helping the men escape, told investigators that she allowed sweat to seduce her and she believed a \" younger guy would actually like an older woman. \" she began to smuggle in food for the men — including pepper, which they planned to use to thwart search dogs — and later gave them tools including hacksaw blades. The failures at the institution in dannemora, ny, were \" longstanding, \" the report states. \" these included the failure by officers assigned to the front gate to search employees ' bags entering the prison; night counts of inmates that were conducted negligently or not at all; inadequate cell searches; and poor supervision of inmates and employees by security staff and civilian managers in the tailor shop, among others. \" matt was shot dead after three weeks on the run. Sweat was recaptured two days later and is now serving six years in solitary confinement. He told investigators that as they made their way out of the prison, the shawshank redemption was on their minds. The prisoners left notes for guards along with dummies in their beds. \" you left me no choice but to grow old and die in here. I had to do something, \" wrote matt in one note. Another, written on a painting he had made of tony soprano, said: \"time to go kid. \" when the pair burst out of a manhole on the outside, their supplies included assorted clothes, a dozen sticks of pepperoni",

Here's what reviewers are saying: fast &amp; furious 6 embodies what we've come to expect from the franchise, jen chaney writes in the washington post. It's a movie about \" hot cars that get into epic accidents, \" and it proves \" there is no such thing as an action sequence that is too over-the-top. \" who cares about the silly plot? \" did you just see tyrese leap onto the roof of that speeding ford escort rs 2000 in order to avoid being crushed by a military tank also traveling on a public thoroughfare at an exceptionally high velocity? \" \" twelve years and a half-dozen speedometer-busting adventures later, the fast &amp; furious franchise is still going strong, \" writes adam nayman at the globe and mail. \" to borrow a bit of stunt-car parlance made famous by quentin tarantino, we might say that the brand is death proof. \" he tips his hat to dwayne \" the rock \" johnson, who he says has \" genuine star presence. \" tom long at the detroit news calls the film \" spectacular junk, \" but also, at times, \" undeniably infectious. \" \" if only it was played off characters who had some sense of reality, who weren't such obvious constructions, and who spoke fewer leaden lines, \" he writes. Still, he says, it's a movie people will want to see. But scott tobias isn't so sure.

At times, it looked like he might not make it. Roughly 2 months into the trip, bertish told sup his craft had been taking on water for nearly two weeks due to rough conditions. \" i have a sea grass growing on my entire deck because it's underwater the entire time, \" he said.

        "summary": "It may not generate the headlines of other global conflicts, but the mediterranean island of cyprus has the distinction of being home to europe's last divided capital city. After four decades, however, that might soon change. The island has been split between a greece-controlled area and a smaller turkey-controlled region since 1974, and diplomats from the two countries are meeting in geneva this week to try to hammer out an agreement. Coverage: the talks: what's happening now is the culmination of 19 months of complex negotiations over how a new cyprus would be run. Barring a last-minute collapse, britain will join the talks later this week to help cinch a deal. The ap lays it out here. Sticking points: the status of property abandoned long ago, the logistics of a rotating presidency, and the role of turkish troops are among the logistics to be straightened out. The bbc has details, and more background. Natural gas: one thing that might spur an agreement is the discovery of offshore gas reserves worth $ 50 billion. Cnbc explains. Symbolic house: the story of the conflict can be seen through the eyes of two men, one whose family left its home in northern cyprus when the trouble began and the second who lives in it now. The ap tells their story. The big deal? \" if successful, the island's reunification could be a game-changer in europe, provide a ( very ) last-minute foreign-policy win for the obama administration, and inspire a region immersed in conflict. \" so asserts an analysis at foreign policy. Risks vs. Rewards: while a deal would surely benefit the island, it would also carry risks for cyprus ' neighbors. See the financial times.",

( reuters ) last week, london elected its first-ever muslim mayor. Sadiq khan, the son of working-class pakistani immigrants, triumphed over a conservative challenger who controversially attempted to implicate khan with connections to islamist extremists. The attacks — considered by many to be ill-judged smears — proved futile, and khan is now the mayor of europe's most-populous capital and one of the world's most diverse and important cities. [ why khan's victory was so remarkable ] his victory comes at a fascinating, tense moment. Britain is poised to hold a referendum next month on its membership in the european union. Those eager to sever ties with brussels are, in part, motivated by fear of immigration and islamist infiltration. Boris johnson, the boisterous politician khan replaced as london's mayor, has become one of the biggest backers of what's known as the \"brexit \" movement. In the build-up to the mayoral election, khan warned against the dangers of the nativist populism that has gripped countries on both sides of the pond.

The researchers says this slow-moving current could continue to divert heat into the deep seas for another decade. However",
            "Oslo, the atlantic ocean has masked global warming this century by soaking up vast amounts of heat from the atmosphere in a shift likely to reverse from around 2030 and spur fast temperature rises, scientists said. The theory is the latest explanation for a slowdown in the pace of warming at the earth's surface since about 1998 that has puzzled experts because it conflicts with rising greenhouse gas emissions, especially from emerging economies led by china. \" we're pointing to the atlantic as the driver of the hiatus, \" ka-kit"

They've started the carbon mineral challenge, which is urging professional and amateur mineral collectors to scour the planet for carbon-bearing minerals. Scientists believe carbon minerals evolved over time and 406 varieties have been found so far. New ones have been popping up at a rate of about four a year since 2010, but scientists estimate there are at least 145 yet to be discovered, per smithsonian. \" they could be hiding in any corner of the world, \" says challenge leader daniel hummer. \" a good way to put it is that we're crowd-sourcing mineralogical research. \" want to get in on the action? scientists offer a few tips: the minerals are probably colorless, poorly crystallized or powdery, a form of carbonate, and may disappear and reappear in time with events like rainfall. They may also be found at a few key sites including canada's poudrette quarry, kukisvumchorr mountain in russia, and clara mine in germany, where other carbon minerals have been discovered, according to a release. Have access to a rock collection? that ' ll work, too, since there could be \" minerals hiding in drawers right now … that we don't even know we have, \" says hummer. Indeed, \" it will be fascinating to see what new and exciting carbon minerals might be lurking in our smithsonian collection drawers, \" a mineral expert at the museum tells scientific american. A team of 25 scientists will review all promising discoveries over the next four years.

Even the startups from former apple employees of that era worked on this sort of thing — remember general magic? it's also sort of the antithesis of everything prior in ios. Ios is explicit and visual. Everything you can do in ios is something you can see and touch on screen. The limits are visible and obvious. Siri, on the other hand, feels limitless. It's fuzzy, and fuzzy on purpose. There's no way to tell what will work and what won't. You must explore. I found it extremely fun to explore siri — primarily because so many of the things i tried actually worked. It's a completely different interface for interacting with your iphone.

            "The iphone 4s this is the easiest product review i've ever written. The iphone 4s is exactly what apple says it is: just like the iphone 4, but noticeably faster, with a significantly improved camera, and an impressive new voice-driven feature called siri. Siri siri feels like old-school apple. Newton-esque, at least in spirit. Sculley-era apple was obsessed with this sort of thing — natural language processing, the computer as \"digital assistant \". New models of human-computer interaction. Ai that works naturally. Even the startups from former apple employees of that era worked on this sort of thing — remember general magic? it's also sort of the antithesis of everything prior in ios. Ios is explicit and visual. Everything you can do in ios is something you can see and touch on screen. The limits are visible and obvious. Siri, on the other hand, feels limitless. It's fuzzy, and fuzzy on purpose. There's no way to tell what will work and what won't. You must explore. I found it extremely fun to explore siri — primarily because so many of the things i tried actually worked. It's a completely different interface for interacting with your iphone. You're not driving or commanding the existing iphone interface with commands. There",
            "Facing increasing competition from smart phone competitors, apple has released the iphone 4s. After testing the phone, wsj's walt mossberg finds a lot to like about it but says owners of the iphone 4 may not need to upgrade. Sometimes, as we all know, looks can be deceiving. While apple's latest iphone doesn't look different, and may not be the kind of blockbuster people expect from the late steve jobs's company, it thinks different, to quote one of apple's old ad slogans. Inside its familiar-looking body there lurks a nascent artificial-intelligence system that has to be tried to be believed. Enlarge image close apple iphone 4s's 8-megapixel camera takes the best photos seen on a phone. Apple's fifth-generation iphone, the $ 199 iphone 4s, goes on sale friday with a new operating system and a new cloud-synchronization service called icloud. But, while its insides have been significantly improved, the phone's exterior design is identical to that of last year's iphone 4, which apple says is the best-selling smartphone in the world. I've been testing the 4s for about a week to see how it differs from the previous model. I also evaluated the key features added by the new operating system, called ios 5, including a new"

On friday, he died of natural causes while awaiting execution, nbc bay area reports. Seaton became the 69th death row inmate to die of natural causes in california since the state reinstated the death penalty in 1978, according to reuters. In that time, only 13 inmates have been executed in the state, and none since 2006. In addition to those natural deaths, 24 death row inmates have committed suicide and eight have died of other causes over the past 37 years, nbc reports. There are still 747 inmates awaiting execution. Reuters reports that while the death penalty is legal in california, executions have been stymied by legal challenges to lethal injections and a lack of political will to fight for capital punishment. Support for the death penalty is dropping around the country and was at a 50-year low in california last year. Only 54 % of californians supported it, down 14 points from 2011. Officials announced the death of seaton, 69, yesterday. The exact cause of his death has yet to be determined; there has been an outbreak of legionnaire's disease at san quentin recently, but officials say there's no indication that played a role.",

About five years ago, moss bought an unopened box that contained a star wars figurine — part of a toy giveaway from the late 1970s, the bbc reports. Moss hoped the box might contain the most coveted figurine, one of the beloved boba fett character firing a rocket, worth about $ 8,000. Moss didn't want to open the white box the figures were originally shipped in and spoil the value, so an editor at the collectors gazette helped him out by bringing it to the university of nottingham. Alas, the university's \" most advanced x-ray micro ct scanner \" ( which normally studies plant roots ) revealed that the figure inside is the villain emperor palpatine, worth maybe $ 50. \" i ' m slightly disappointed but it's still an amazing thing to have, \" says moss, who fortunately only paid about $ 8 for the boxed figure. Of course, given how palpatine hid his own identity of darth sidious, maybe it was appropriate that he was the one inside, writes rich trenholm at cnet. \" it's enough to make you turn to the dark side. \" weirdly, palpatine is in the news for another reason: an upcoming \" in-canon book \" has revealed his first name for the first time, reports cinema blend.

Those foods, along with corn, beans, and peanuts, which belong to a category called kitniyot, were previously banned for ashkenazi jews living outside of israel during passover, which began friday. The reason for the prohibition? those foods are sometimes mixed with wheat, the eating of which is permissible during the 8-day festival only in the form of matzah. To avoid any accidental consumption of wheat, kitniyot was banned altogether in the 13th century. Other groups, such as the sephardi jews, have always eaten these foods on passover, the times of israel reports. Now, a new world of passover cuisine has been opened up to ashkenazi jews — the largest jewish group in the us, reuters reports. Traditional passover dishes include beef brisket, gefilte fish, and matzo ball soup. Both budgetary and health reasons prompted the change, which was approved by 19 rabbis, with one opposing and two abstaining, per the times. \"passover foods are high in fat and cholesterol, \" one us rabbi says, adding that meat is expensive and, depending on how it is raised, \" environmentally questionable. \" \" for vegans, \" another rabbi tells reuters, \" it was really a matter of not having protein for eight days. \" still, not all jews are welcoming the change. \"we won't be doing anything different this year, \" lynne sandler of virginia tells the times. \"we've lived our lives without it. \" ( here are some \" sensitive \" study results on another jewish tradition: circumcision. )",

The move comes partly in response to the growing popularity of gluten-free and vegan diets, said rabbi elliot dorff, chair of the conservative movement's committee on jewish law and standards.

Jews of ashkenazi descent, typically from eastern europe, are still in the majority in the united states.

Sandler, a member of conservative agudas achim congregation in alexandria, virginia, said she won't take advantage of her movement's ruling in december that permits eating a category of food called kitniyot that includes rice, beans and other legumes. These foods have always been eaten by sephardi jews on passover, but have banned by ashkenazi rabbis since the 1200s.

By dispensing with a custom whose roots in jewish law are relatively recent as such things go, they argue, the ruling responds to modern concerns over nutrition, finances and even jewish unity. All three factors are weighed in the teshuvah, or ruling, which passed with 19 rabbis in favor, one opposed and two abstaining. With many jews complaining about the high cost of eating during passover, and the lack of healthy packaged foods, the committee's ruling referred"

Nearly five months of legal battling ensued, as the california toddler's parents — who did not agree with the prognosis — fought to keep him on life support. The fight ended abruptly thursday, after what the sacramento bee calls a \" surprise ruling \" by a los angeles superior court judge that the boy be removed from life support. He stopped breathing almost immediately. \" he's gone, \" israel's mom jonee fonseca tells the bee. At the beginning of the saga, she and israel's dad, nate stinson, initially had israel transferred from davis to kaiser permanente in roseville; that hospital also determined he was brain-dead, the washington post reports. They refused to sign a california death certificate issued by kaiser, started a gofundme campaign, and filed an injunction to stop kaiser from removing him from the ventilator. All the while, they posted videos and updates for their supporters and got pro bono support from lawyers. A federal judge rejected the injunction in may, so israel's parents took him to guatemala, where, according to his parents, an electroencephalogram showed brain activity. Children's hospital in los angeles then accepted israel, and he was brought there about two weeks ago — but doctors at children's agreed he was brain-dead and sought to take him off life support. Israel's parents were granted a temporary restraining order, but the hospital successfully appealed. ( the family of jahi mcmath is in a similar fight. )",

U.s. President barack obama waves as he walks from the oval office of the white house in washington before their departure september 9, 2015. Washington president barack obama has directed his administration to prepare to take in at least 10,000 syrian refugees over the next year, the white house said on thursday. It is the first specific commitment the united states has made toward increasing its acceptance of refugees from the war-torn country. Since the start of the syrian civil war in 2011, the united states has taken in 1,500 refugees, with 300 more expected to be cleared by october. But refugee advocates and some members of congress said taking in an additional 10,000 refugees did not go far enough toward addressing the humanitarian crisis triggered by the war, which has prompted a massive refugee influx into europe. In a letter distributed to house members and seen by reuters, democratic representative david cicilline asked obama to accommodate 65,000 syrian refugees by the end of 2016. Religious groups have called for the united states to accept 100,000 syrian refugees. European countries have taken in waves of migrants fleeing violence. Germany allowed 20,000 migrants into the country over the weekend and is preparing for 800,000 this year.

This is not time for autopilot. This is time to really ramp things up, \" said nezer. The united states is conducting air strikes in syria as part of its effort to fight against islamic state. It currently admits a total of 70,000 refugees from around the world annually, and is due to increase that total by 5,000 for the fiscal year starting in october. White house spokesman josh earnest would not say whether the 10,000 syrians would be a part of or in addition to that total.

        "summary": "A ray of hope at the white house? republican senators emerged from a nearly 2-hour meeting with president obama today saying the two sides are closer to an agreement — or are at least listening to each other, politico reports. What's more, the washington post reports that obama talked by phone with john boehner afterwards, and both agreed that the two sides should keep talking. So it looks like no one's getting time off this weekend. In other details: republican senators said the conversation turned to broader us fiscal issues, rather than just focusing on obamacare. \" i was pleasantly surprised, \" said sen. Bob corker. \" i think there's a jelling that's beginning to take place. \" momentum may be shifting against house republicans, as many gop senators joined obama in opposing a 6-week debt-limit extension — a proposal that would likely create deadlock right around thanksgiving and the holiday shopping season. After the meeting, top republicans continued to craft a bipartisan solution that would extend the us borrowing limit until the end of january, reopen government to the end of march, and either delay or ease a tax on medical devices under obamacare — terms closer to what obama would accept, the new york times reports. The gop effort to \" defund obamacare \" seems to be fading, except for sen. Ted cruz, who said that any agreement \" should provide real relief to the millions of people who are losing their job or forced into part-time work or losing their health insurance because of obamacare. \"",

In addition to the above issues outlined in an aug. 12 letter to hampton creek ceo joshua tetrick, the fda also warns that just mayo violates other fda standards, including that it makes \" cholesterol free \" and heart-healthy claims that aren't valid. The company was given 15 working days to respond to the letter, the ap notes, and tetrick said yesterday he had a \" really good conversation \" with the fda and that \" we feel good about where we are from a regulatory perspective, from a legal perspective. \" he said he didn't think the name just mayo would ultimately have to go, though the fda's letter states a number of times that the just mayo products are \" misbranded. \" ( the government of belgium may call a \" mayo summit \" to discuss its own mayonnaise laws. )",

        "summary": "Pyongyang has today confirmed that kim jong un's uncle has been fired and it sounds like jang song thaek was a pretty busy guy during his years as north korea's second most powerful official. According to pyongyang's statement, jang led a \" dissolute and depraved \" lifestyle, using drugs and having \" improper relations with several women, \" the washington post reports. Kim's uncle was also an \" ideologically sick and extremely idle and easygoing \" man who used drugs and blew the country's cash at foreign casinos, all while disobeying orders from kim and plotting to build up his own power base. The bbc reports state news agency kcna released not just the statement but also images that show jang being forcibly removed from a party meeting by guards; it has the photos. Jang — whose wife may be purged next — \" committed criminal acts baffling imagination and they did tremendous harm to our party and revolution, \" pyongyang says. One of jang's top aides is believed to have fled to south korea, in what would be the north's highest-profile defection in more than 15 years, reports reuters. So what does it all mean for north korea? jang was spearheading economic reforms that may now be on the back burner, analysts say, and the high-profile nature of his ousting appears to be a warning against dissent — and a signal that kim plans to treat political rivals more harshly than his father did. Further, the wall street journal reports that the \" power-consolidation move \" could actually usher in instability. The military and ruling party each claim a good deal of power, and jang, for all his military titles, was seen as a party figure. A former us official says the purge could result in a perceived power shift toward the military.",

The post uses as a case study al-bab, a town of about 175,000 in the same region as aleppo that mostly stayed out of the conflict until regime troops opened fire on a protest april 20. That killing mobilized the town. Within months, it had formed a militia, and though it calls itself part of the free syrian army, it's run independently. On sunday, it succeeded in routing the army garrison there, proving how tenuous the regime's grip on power is in some places. Meanwhile, fighting continues to rage in aleppo. Regime troops say they've taken the rebel-friendly salaheddine district, but rebels deny that, and say the regime is on its back foot. One rebel commander tells reuters that he thinks his men can claim the city center \" within days, not weeks. \"",

During the day on tuesday large clouds of black smoke rose into the sky after attack helicopters turned their machineguns on eastern districts for the first time in the latest fighting and a mig warplane later strafed the same area. After nightfall, reuters journalists in aleppo heard loud explosions somewhere near the city. At least 10 volleys of shells lit up the night sky and drowned out the sound of the islamic call to prayer. Carloads of rebel fighters shouting \" god is great \" sped off towards the fighting. The battle for aleppo, syria's largest city, has become a crucial test for both sides in the 16-month-old rebellion. Neither assad's forces nor the rag-tag rebels can afford to lose if they hope to prevail in the wider struggle for syria. Syria's civil war has entered a far more violent phase since july 18 when a bomb killed four top members of president bashar al-assad's inner circle.

For those who follow such things, the name will be familiar: it's craig wright, the man wired magazine identified as the all-but-certain creator of the digital currency last year. Now wright himself has given interviews to the bbc, the economist, and gq to say that he is indeed the man behind the pseudonym satoshi nakamoto. Wright also posted a blog entry with technical details to buttress his claim, one that will surely be pored over in the coming days. \" satoshi is dead, \" he writes. The economist's takeaway: \" our conclusion is that mr. Wright could well be mr. Nakamoto, but that important questions remain. Indeed, it may never be possible to establish beyond reasonable doubt who really created bitcoin. \" wright says he's come forward now to end the speculation — \" there are lots of stories out there that have been made up and i don't like it hurting those people i care about, \" he tells the bbc — but he says he isn't interested in being the \" public face \" of bitcoin. \" i just want to be left alone. \" the revelation comes at a pivotal time for the currency, as two competing camps within the community wrestle with whether it should remain \" smallish and pure \" or go more mainstream, says the economist. Wright says he chose the fictional name nakamoto after a 17th-century philosopher and merchant in japan. As for the name satoshi, \" some things should remain secret. \" if he is indeed nakamoto, wright is a wealthy man, because \" nakamoto \" holds the equivalent of about $ 450 million in bitcoins. Still, gq notes that the revelation also puts wright in danger of prosecution, given the use of bitcoin in the internet's shadowy realms such as the silk road.",

Originally among a group of 44 susquehanna county residents who sued cabot in 2009, these two couples — nolen scott ely and monica marta-ely and raymond and victoria hubert — refused to settle in 2012, reports the scranton times-tribune. After a 14-day trial in which the couples argued cabot negligently drilled two natural-gas wells that contaminated their water wells with methane, a federal jury agreed, awarding $ 2.6 million to the elys and $ 1.4 million to the huberts. Each of their children, a total of four, were awarded $ 50,000 over the fracking. \" it wasn't about the money, \" nolen scott ely says. \" we were voicing ourselves and standing up for our rights. \" cabot plans to appeal. A state investigation that started in 2009 found cabot responsible for contaminating 18 water supplies in dimock township, where residents complained that brown water would cause a lit match to burst into flame, reports the pittsburgh post-gazette. \" oh my god! they heard! they heard! \" said the couples ' attorney, leslie lewis, after the verdict. Cabot attorney jeremy mercer says that there was no evidence to suggest anything but naturally occurring gas reached the couples ' wells and that the water problems started before cabot began drilling nearby. He also accused lewis of mentioning evidence that was supposed to have been excluded. \" without plaintiffs ' counsel's conduct, the evidence in this case did not allow for a jury to reach the verdict it did, \" he says.

That boyfriend, donthe lucas, was charged friday with first-degree murder in connection with the death of kelsie schelling, whose body has not been found. The denver channel notes friday marks the first time that the long-running investigation has been described by authorities as a \" homicide investigation. \" details on what triggered his arrest are scarce. His home was searched in april, but police didn't comment on what they did or didn't find. All that has been found is schelling's car, discovered in a hospital parking lot in pueblo more than a week after she vanished. People quotes a police statement that notes lucas ' arrest came as he was already in custody on unrelated armed-robbery charges. He's not the only lucas in jail over the september robbery, per kktv: the 25-year-old's brother duschon and mother sara have also been arrested, and his sister desiree was on monday rearrested for bond revocation. Dan corsentino, a former county sheriff hired by schelling's family to investigate, said investigators suspect lucas ' family members could know something. \" it was difficult for law enforcement to penetrate the shroud of secrecy that existed within the donthe lucas family, \" he says. \" i think it's highly possible a family member or someone close to donthe could have turned. \" read more details on schelling's last known night here.",

        "summary": "Run run shaw might not be a household name, but these are: chow yun-fat and john woo, who got their starts at his studio, and quentin tarantino, who was one of many filmmakers inspired by him. Shaw, the hong kong producer who is considered the father of the kung fu movie genre, died today at home in hong kong, aged 106. Shaw was born shao yifu; \" run run \" was a nickname. He and his older brother, the similarly-nicknamed run me, made their first film in 1924. By 1927, they had moved to singapore and were producing movies as well as importing others to play in their theaters, the new york times reports. After world war ii, run run ended up in hong kong, where, by the late 1960s, he was enjoying great success making modern martial arts movies including five fingers of death and shaolin avenger. The shaw bros. Studio was the largest in asia at that time, and produced the region's most popular films, the los angeles times reports. \" we were like the hollywood of the 1930s, \" shaw once said; he had created shaw movietown, a huge complex where his employees both lived and worked. \" we controlled everything: the talent, the production, the distribution and the exhibition. \" but he lost out on one very big name: bruce lee. Lee wanted $ 10,000 per movie and a long-term contract, which shaw rejected; a competing company, founded by a former shaw employee, ended up backing lee instead. But shaw's success continued: in addition to the nearly 1,000 films his companies released, he eventually expanded into television, publishing, real estate, and more — he became one of macy's biggest shareholders in the 1990s, to help save it from bankruptcy — and even co-produced us movies including blade runner. He was also a generous philanthropist who was eventually knighted by queen elizabeth ii. He is survived by his second wife and four children, the ap reports.",

The clinton campaign won't confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails, but working on the assumption that they would vigorously deny them if they were forgeries, there are indeed some noteworthy items of information to be gleaned from the emails, as well as from recent foia requests related to clinton's private email server, and the slow trickle of information coming out of the fbi regarding its investigation into clinton's server. We've rounded up the ten most interesting recent revelations into the clinton machine below: 1. John podesta thinks bitcoin is too \" libertarian \" to be associated with the clinton campaign.

Leaders receiving an update on the mission against osama bin laden was too scandalous. What was so offensive about the image? u.s. Secretary of state hillary clinton was in the photo and, based on good intel, the editor of der tzitung discovered that she is a woman. The hasidic newspaper will not intentionally include any images of women in the paper because it could be considered sexually suggestive.

        "summary": "Researchers say they've found the most conclusive proof to date that a good breakfast translates into better grades for kids. In a large-scale study out of cardiff university, researchers in wales asked 5,000 children aged 9 to 11 to record everything they ate over 24 hours, from breakfast on the first day to breakfast on the second, reports the guardian. The results showed that kids who ate a quality breakfast had twice the chance of receiving above-average scores in standardized assessment tests six to 18 months later, compared to those who skipped. The word \" quality \" is key: kids who ate candy or other junk food for breakfast — about 20 % reported doing so — saw no boost in scores. This \" offers the strongest evidence yet of links between aspects of what pupils eat and how well they do at school, \" says the lead author in a release. While breakfast programs \" can be seen as an unwelcome diversion, \" they \" might also deliver educational improvements, \" the researcher adds. The head of one school tells the bbc that teachers can tell which students have skipped breakfast. \" by around 10am they start flagging, \" she says. \" it has an effect on behavior and concentration. \" in fact, teachers in the study estimated that kids who come to school hungry lose about two hours of learning a day, notes the international business times.

Yet if you want to track him down after hours, you ' ll need to peek inside a bunch of texas dumpsters. The 37-year-old austin man told randall sullivan, writing for wired, that he's made a killing moonlighting as a dumpster-diver, extracting an astonishing amount of \" treasure \" that he can either use for his own hobbies or refurbish and resell. He's gotten it down to a science, creating spreadsheets for inventory, figuring out when garbage day is for each target site, and mapping out particularly lucrative locations, like big-box retailers, college campuses ( rich kids throw out lots of stuff, he claims ), storage facilities, and stores going out of business or undergoing a remodel. His vocation has paid off big time: he says if he chose to make it his full-time job, he'd make at least $ 250,000 a year. Malone started what he calls his \" for-profit archaeologist \" career nine years ago when he had to pick through the trash of a client for a security job. He was amazed at his first haul — a line of discontinued printers from officemax, still in their boxes — and was hooked. He's picked up plenty of tips along the way from other divers, including focusing on consumables ( e.g., paper, toner ) rather than just big-ticket items, and knows to \" move along \" if cops ask him to. He takes special pleasure in offering typically expensive finds for much-lower prices to people who couldn't afford them otherwise. Sullivan, who went with him on a couple of \" dives, \" predicts malone could actually pull in about $ 600,000 per year if every night was as productive as the ones he tagged along on. So why doesn't malone just troll for trash full time? he says he likes his day job. ( must be something about texas dumpsters — this professor redecorated one to live in. )",

Were it not for the sliding pitched roof and weather station perched on top, a reasonable person might dismiss the box as \"just another dumpster \" — providing this person did not encounter the dean of the university college jeff wilson living inside. Professor wilson went to the dumpster not just because he wished to live deliberately, and not just to teach his students about the environmental impacts of day-to-day life, and not just to gradually transform the dumpster into \"the most thoughtfully-designed, tiniest home ever constructed. \" wilson's reasons are a tapestry of these things. Until this summer, the green dumpster was even less descript than it is now. There was no sliding roof; wilson kept the rain out with a tarp. He slept on cardboard mats on the floor. It was essentially, as he called it, \"dumpster camping. \" the goal was to establish a baseline experience of the dumpster without any accoutrements, before adding them incrementally.

Essentially, the higher the speed limit is on a road, the faster the birds take off to avoid oncoming traffic. That may seem like a no-brainer, but here's the part that especially intrigued the researchers: the birds don't react based on the speed of a particular vehicle, but on the average speed of the road. They ' ll take their sweet old time on slow roads and rush on fast ones, no matter the speed of an individual car. \" in other words, the birds appear to have adapted street savvy to survive alongside these strange metal-clad beasts, our cars, by judging their typical behavior, \" writes stephen messenger at treehugger. That, of course, makes drivers exceeding the speed limit especially dangerous to them. National geographic quotes the study's co-author explaining how the findings could be applied to wildlife safety: \" if you have different speed limits for similar roads in similar landscapes, it could be dangerous for birds because they hardly have any cues of those changes. \" also of note: more birds tend to get hit in the spring, possibly because young ones haven't yet learned the rules of the road, notes new scientist.",

For our planet's wildlife, creatures which evolved over millions of car-free years, these mechanical monsters must seem like a puzzling new arrival to their local habitats -- fast-moving threats which appear to be multiplying at an alarming rate. But as it turns out, birds in particular might actually be adapting to our driving habits, capable of sensing how fast cars typically move on individual roads so they know just when to get out of the way. Biologist pierre legagneux, lead-author on a recent study about this behavior, says the idea for this research sprung up from bird behavior most drivers witness every day: avian jaywalkers taking flight as to avoid being run over. While that survival instinct might seem pretty straightforward, legagneux soon discovered that birds were doing more than just responding to an approaching object -- they were actually anticipating its arrival time considering the average speed of cars that pass by there. Legagneux, who tested reaction times of birds on both fast and slow roadways, found the 21 bird types he studied \" associate road sections with speed limits as a way to assess collision risk. \" in other words, the birds appear to have adapted street savvy to survive alongside these strange metal-clad beasts, our",
            "Birds cannot read road signs, but they know that some roads have higher speed limits than others. They will take off further away from an approaching car on a faster road than on a slower road – regardless of the speed of the car. When pierre legagneux of the university of quebec at rimouski and simon ducatez of mcgill university in montreal, both in canada, were working together in france in 2006, they began studying the birds they encountered on the drive home from the lab. They found that where there was a 50-kilometre-per-hour speed limit, birds on the road typically took off when the car was about 15 metres away, whereas on a 110-km-per-hour road, they took off when a car was nearer 75 metres away. They did this even when faced with a car travelling faster on the slow road or slower on the fast road. Know your limits \" what was really cool is that birds did not respond to the speed of the car but rather to the speed limit of the road section, \" says legagneux. \" it was like they were able to read road signs – although they obviously do not. \" the researchers think the birds treat cars as predators, and realise that in some parts of their environment the predators are more dangerous than in others.

When pierre legagneux of the university of quebec at rimouski and simon ducatez of mcgill university in montreal, both in canada, were working together in france in 2006, they began studying the birds they encountered on the drive home from the lab. They found that where there was a 50-kilometre-per-hour speed limit, birds on the road typically took off when the car was about 15 metres away, whereas on a 110-km-per-hour road, they took off when a car was nearer 75 metres away. They did this even when faced with a car travelling faster on the slow road or slower on the fast road. Know your limits \" what was really cool is that birds did not respond to the speed of the car but rather to the speed limit of the road section, \" says legagneux. \" it was like they were able to read road signs – although they obviously do not. \" the researchers think the birds treat cars as predators, and realise that in some parts of their environment the predators are more dangerous than in others.

Only a day after accidentally legalizing some recreational drugs, ireland has passed new legislation that clearly states the possession of drugs including ecstasy and crystal meth is illegal. Yesterday, an emergency law banning the substances made its way through the irish legislature and was signed by president michael d. Higgins. The law went into effect at midnight, ireland's minister for health leo varadkar tells cnn, meaning the so-called \" headshop drugs \" were only legal for about 36 hours. An appeals court inadvertently legalized the possession of numerous drugs when it struck down a section of the misuse of drugs act 1977, which it deemed unconstitutional because ministers were able to add drugs to a banned list without parliament's approval. Varadkar previously said \" dozens \" of cases could be affected by the loophole, but tells the irish times, \" i am advised that people who were charged in recent times in many cases were charged, not just under this section of legislation, but under other legislation as well. \"",

        "summary": "It's a new front for states dealing with legal marijuana: potentially dangerous pesticides used to grow the stuff. Colorado's governor on nov. 12 ordered state and local agencies to destroy any marijuana or marijuana products tainted by unapproved pesticides, the denver post reports. And oregon won't be far behind: beginning in 2016, any marijuana sold in the state must be screened by an accredited lab for 60 common pesticides, reports the oregonian. Any batch that exceeds allowable amounts must be destroyed. In colorado, gov. John hickenlooper's order goes much further than similar efforts taken by denver health officials. According to the ap, city officials started quarantining marijuana plants grown with unapproved pesticides more than six months ago. They would then release the plants back into circulation once tests showed pesticide concentrations in them were below harmful levels, the post reports. Unlike denver's policy, hickenlooper's order doesn't appear to leave room for even trace amounts of unapproved pesticides, the post reports. \" when a pesticide is applied to a crop in a manner that is inconsistent with the pesticide's label, and the crop is contaminated by that pesticide, it constitutes a threat to the public safety, \" the order states. Because marijuana remains illegal under federal law, the epa hasn't run any tests to see what pesticides are safe for use on marijuana, so states are on their own. A post investigation found high concentrations of unapproved pesticides in consumer products, leading to the quarantines and recalls last spring, and an oregonian investigation found much the same. \" for a lot of producers, this could be the end for them or it could mean they choose not to come into the regulated market, \" says one organic grower in oregon.

The order came after the denver post reported that pesticides barred for use on cannabis were still being applied and found at high concentrations in products sold to consumers. Denver city officials placed thousands of plants on hold last spring after finding they'd been treated with unauthorized chemicals. The city has since issued a half-dozen recalls of marijuana products. Other plants have been released back into commerce because residual levels of the pesticides dropped to safe levels.",

Marijuana concentrates, which tend to be contaminated at higher levels than flowers, must be tested before they go onto store shelves or used to make edible products.

The new requirements, spelled out in temporary rules issued by the oregon health authority, represent a radical shift in how oregon addresses pesticide use in the cannabis industry.

Per fox news, the last time abrini had been spotted was on nov. 11, two days before the paris attacks, at a gas station near paris with another suspect in the paris attacks, salah abdeslam. The latter was arrested march 18 in brussels and is now being held in a bruges prison. Abrini has a bunch of convictions to his name in belgium, including for robbery and violence.

About 10 emergency agencies were involved in the rescue; rescue crews and atvs had to hike a hydraulic system and airbags to the woman, who was about an hour from the trailhead. It took more than two hours to free her, and then rescuers carried her 45 minutes to a helicopter at the top of the mountain that took her to the hospital. Though she was critically injured — she had multiple fractures and was unconscious during the rescue — the fire department says her vital signs were \" fairly good. \" as the post explains, rockslides are a fairly typical occurrence during the temperature changes involved in the freeze-thaw cycle in the spring.

Reagan's foundation, which opposed the sale. \" we have negotiated with the consignor to arrange for the item to be withdrawn from the auction and donated to the ronald reagan presidential foundation, a considerable financial gesture from the consignor, \" said the auction company, which is based in the british channel islands. \" we are very pleased with this outcome and wish to thank the consignor and pfc auctions for their assistance in this matter, \" said john heubusch, executive director of the reagan foundation, in a statement. The vial of blood came from a maryland laboratory, where it had been sent for testing for lead after the failed assassination attempt on mr. Reagan in 1981, according to documents accompanying the vial shown on the auction site. A lab employee had kept the vial as a memento and later passed it on to her adult son, according to a letter and documentation posted on the site",
