Coli outbreak at chipotle locations — suggest close to 200 people have fallen ill after eating at a ohio restaurant, per business insider. The location at 9733 sawmill parkway in the columbus suburb of powell closed monday based on \" a few reports of illness, \" with a rep noting \" we are not aware of any confirmed foodborne illness cases, \" reports the columbus dispatch. The number of reports has since ballooned to 182 as of this writing, with most describing multiple people with nausea and diarrhea. In one case, a family of six, including four kids ages 1 to 8, describes coming down with food poisoning symptoms after \" celebrating completion of the summer reading program with the coupons provided as prizes. \" per the dispatch, a thursday health inspection at the location found pinto and black beans weren't kept at a high-enough temperature, while lettuce wasn't appropriately chilled. The inspection report noted both issues were corrected the same day, though chipotle, whose shares fell more than 3 % in after-hours trading monday, says it's doing a deep cleaning of the restaurant anyway.

Per dnainfo, the woman on the divvy bike, ided by the cook county medical examiner as virginia murray, tried to make a turn east from sacramento avenue to belmont avenue and smashed into the truck making the same turn; a witness says she was thrown 6 feet into the air before crashing to the ground. Murray suffered severe injuries to her upper body and was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Bike-sharing programs — where riders pay a fee to pick up a bike at a self-serve station, then drop it off at another location when they're done — are increasing in popularity around the us, with the wall street journal noting there are about 40 currently in existence. And while the mineta transportation institute has noted bike sharing can be seen as being \" inherently unsafe \" for bicyclists ( including riders not using helmets and not being familiar with a city's landscape ), a study found \" collision and injury rates for bikesharing are lower \" than rates for regular cyclists. ( police say murray was wearing a helmet, per the journal. ) still, an active transportation alliance director tells the tribune that murray's death is \" a tragic reminder that we still have work to do to make our streets safe for everyone. \" in a statement, divvy and chicago's dot shared their \" deepest condolences to the rider's family and loved ones, \" per the tribune, with the paper noting that divvy has provided almost 8 million rides since it was introduced in the windy city three years ago.

Major cities have established large bikesharing systems, including boston, chicago, denver, minneapolis-saint paul, new york city, salt lake city, the san francisco bay area, seattle, washington dc, and others. These systems began operating as early as 2010, and no fatalities have occurred within the us as of this writing. However, three have happened in north america — two in canada and one in mexico. Bikesharing has some qualities that appear inherently unsafe for bicyclists. Most prominently, helmet usage is documented to be quite low in most regions. Bikesharing is also used by irregular bicyclists who are less familiar with the local terrain. In this study, researchers take a closer look at bikesharing safety from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Through a series of four focus groups, they discussed bikesharing usage and safety with bikesharing members and nonmembers in the bay area. They further engaged experts nationwide from a variety of fields to evaluate their opinions and perspectives",

To track how the information flowed, agents will try to gain access to the email accounts of many state department officials who worked there while mrs. Clinton was secretary of state, the officials said. State department employees apparently circulated the emails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011, and some were ultimately forwarded to mrs. Clinton. They were not marked as classified, the state department has said, and it is unclear whether its employees knew the origin of the information. The f.b.i.

        "summary": "This year's public service announcements urging people to get a flu shot might have just gotten some extra ammo: new research suggests the shots not only help ward off the flu but protect the heart as well, reports the la times. An analysis of previous studies found that 3 % of people who got the flu vaccine went on to have some kind of \" cardiovascular event, \" as opposed to 5 % who got a placebo, according to the study published in the journal of the american medical association. That is, those who got flu shots reduced their risk by about a third of having a heart attack. \" if there are those out there who for whatever reason don't get the flu shot or don't feel that they need it … this is one more reason why they might help, \" the lead researcher tells reuters. So what's going on? webmd explains a leading theory: the flu triggers an inflammatory immune response in the body, and that inflammation could spell trouble for arteries, especially ones already compromised. If the shot keeps the flu away, all that is avoided. The researchers say those who already have heart disease should be especially vigilant about getting the yearly flu vaccine.",

But a new report by amnesty international shows that not only has the practice continued into the present day — it's given iran the dubious distinction of being \" one of the leading executioners of juvenile offenders, \" the new york times reports. At least 73 youngsters have been executed in iran between 2005 and 2015, per the report, and at least 160 juveniles are now on the country's death row, and those are probably conservative numbers ( the report notes actual figures are probably higher but unknown because info about the death penalty is \" shrouded in secrecy \" ). And it's apparently much worse for girls than for boys, a deputy director for the group says. \" iran continues to lag behind the rest of the world, maintaining laws that permit girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15 to be sentenced to death, \" says said boumedouha. This in spite of supposedly significant changes to the country's islamic penal code — changes meant to offer judges \" alternative punishments \" to the death penalty when juveniles are involved. In fact, the need for those changes in the first place shows what a dismal failure iran has been in dealing with this issue, since in 1994 it ratified its participation in the un's convention on the rights of the child, which states that \" neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed [ on ] … persons below 18 years of age. \" \" the report debunks recent attempts by iran's authorities to whitewash their continuing violations of children's rights and deflect criticism of their appalling record as one of the world's last executioners of juvenile offenders, \" the amnesty report reads.

After warning the youth that her husband, nfl player mike fisher, was in the arena, underwood asked chase \"ok, how are we going to do this? \" give the boy credit for guts: he replied, \"lip to lip. \" so underwood gave him a kiss square on the lips. You know that's a moment he won't ever forget. After the concert, the superstar even posted a picture of the smooch and thanked the boy on twitter @carrieunderwood: \"thanks, chase, for the kiss and thanks louisville for rocking so hard tonight! we had fun! #liptolip \" what a sweet, fun, classy moment, that you can share in thanks to that ol ' youtube magic.

Halfway through her pregnancy, kristine barry of barrie, ont., learned her unborn son had a heart defect in which the two main arteries of his heart were reversed, reports the cbc. Putting the aorta and pulmonary artery in their rightful places would require open-heart surgery after birth. But because barry's unborn son also had no opening to allow blood to flow between the upper and lower chambers of his heart, he would be unable to circulate oxygen through his body once separated from his mother's placenta, with brain and other organ damage occurring within minutes. \" he likely wasn't going to make it, \" barry, 25, tells the toronto star. But doctors weren't about to give up. In what may be the first balloon atrial septoplasty performed on a baby in the womb, doctors from mount sinai hospital and sick kids hospital in toronto used a needle to insert a balloon through barry's uterus and into the boy's heart, opening a passageway between the chambers. Five days later on may 23, sebastian was delivered \" all pink and screaming, \" rather than \" blue and not vocal \" as initially expected, barry says. Two months after undergoing open-heart surgery to repair his heart defect, he's healthy and happy and barry can't thank doctors enough. \" it's just amazing what they're able and capable of doing, \" she tells the canadian press.

Sewage water had leaked into the alexandria sarcophagus over the centuries through a crack, meaning that instead of well-preserved mummies, antiquities head mostafa waziry and his team found three skeletons, a vile red liquid, and a terrible smell when they opened the sarcophagus, the guardian reports. The discovery of the massive sarcophagus two weeks ago sparked rumors that the tomb of alexander the great could have been found, but archaeologists believe the three bodies were those of soldiers, judging by the lack of elaborate death masks and the arrow wound in one of the skulls, the week reports. Waziry spoke to the media to dispel rumors that the sarcophagus was cursed, the bbc reports. \" we've opened it and, thank god, the world has not fallen into darkness, \" he said. \" i was the first to put my whole head inside the sarcophagus...

Catholic news service published the letter friday from then-archbishop leonardo sandri to the rev. Boniface ramsay, a new york priest who made the initial allegation. Ramsay informed the vatican in a november 2000 letter about then cardinal theodore mccarrick's misconduct with seminarians from seton hall university's immaculate conception seminary. Ramsay says he sent the letter at the request of the then-vatican ambassador because he had heard so many complaints from seminarians that mccarrick would invite them to his beach house and into his bed. Sandri, now a top-ranked vatican cardinal who was the no. 3 in the vatican's secretariat of state at the time, wrote ramsay on oct. 11, 2006, seeking his recommendation for a former seminarian for a vatican job. In it, he referred to ramsay's 2000 letter, saying: \" i ask with particular reference to the serious matters involving some of the students of the immaculate conception seminary, which in november 2000 you were good enough to bring confidentially to the attention of the then-apostolic nuncio in the united states, the late archbishop gabriel montalvo. \" archbishop carlo maria vigano, at the center of a storm rocking pope francis ' papacy, cited ramsay's 2000 letter in his own expose of a cover-up about the mccarrick affair.",

Critics and audiences are equally in love, giving the flick a 92 % and 90 % approval rating, respectively, on rotten tomatoes. Some highlights: \" spielberg can't help but make the kind of inspiring, classically constructed drama that we keep being told hollywood doesn't produce anymore. Thank goodness he still does, \" writes ann hornaday writes at the washington post. British actor mark rylance gives \" what, with luck, will be a career-making performance \" as accused soviet spy rudolf abel, she adds. He's \" an example of screen acting at its most subtle, poignant and exquisitely calibrated. \" \" bridge of spies isn't conventionally exciting, and isn't intended to be. Instead, it's satisfying — thoroughly and pleasurably so, \" writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. It's \" a fascinating piece of fiction based on fact, a cold war parable of moral principles colliding with the imperatives of national security, \" he adds. Hanks portrays james donovan \" with stirring conviction leavened by enjoyable zest, \" morgenstern writes, while \" rylance's performance is a minimalist wonder. \" essentially, the movie \" is a moral drama driven by an insurance lawyer. That it works at all is a miracle — or would be, if anyone other than st. Steven were involved, \" writes ty burr at the boston globe. \" compact and to the point it's not, \" but it is \" plush, professional, tonally wobbly, and very watchable, \" he says.

The 70-year-old weisselberg is no mere acquaintance: he has served for decades as chief financial officer and executive vp of the trump organization, reports the wall street journal. In fact, when trump was elected president, he turned over the financial reins of his business empire to weisselberg and to trump's adult sons. Weisselberg actually started working for the organization in the 1970s, when trump's father, fred, ran it, per nbc news. Earlier this year, weisselberg was called to testify before a grand jury as part of the investigation of cohen's payments to two women in exchange for their silence about alleged affairs with trump. Weisselberg had been mentioned in a recorded conversation between cohen and trump about how to facilitate a payment to former playboy model karen mcdougal. Cohen has pleaded guilty to eight charges and said trump directed him to make the hush-money payments ahead of the election, possibly implicating the president in a federal crime. It's not clear what information weisselberg provided in the investigation. ( this week, trump suggested that \" flipping \" in exchange for deals with prosecutors should be illegal. )",

The prospect of rubio doing so gained traction in the wake of the orlando shooting, but he continued to insist that he wouldn't run against his friend already in the race, carlos lopez-cantera. Now, however, lopez-cantera himself is publicly giving rubio the all-clear, reports politico. He says he and rubio discussed it in recent days, with lopez-cantera encouraging him to consider changing his mind. \"i don't want you to feel like you have to say that because of outside pressure, \" he quotes rubio as responding. The incumbent told reporters on wednesday that he'd go home this week to spend time with his family and consider his next steps. Rumors are swirling that the pair have some sort of plan — perhaps for rubio to win the seat over a democrat ( republicans believe he has the best shot ), then resign and allow lopez-cantera to run before the 2020 presidential campaign. But lopez-cantera says that's not the case. \" until i mentioned this, he was really committed to spending time with his kids, being able to be home for more than 10 days without having to go somewhere, \" he says. As of now, \" nothing has changed, \" he adds. \" i ' m still running.

But \" what seemed like a good idea — a comedy based on the phenomenon of identity theft — turned out to be comic quicksand, \" because having your life ruined at random isn't really funny. Bateman comes off as \" a dramatic character facing personal tragedy who just happens to be stuck in a supposed comedy. \" the screenplay \" tortures itself \" to get its leads on a buddy-movie-esque road trip together, complains ty burr at the boston globe. \" no, it doesn't make sense. Nothing in this movie makes sense. Next to identity thief, inception is a marvel of sober concision. \" it's littered with \" comedy clichés, \" and worse, an \" obnoxious sentimentality, \" like the \" generic equivalent of a judd apatow movie. \" rex reed at the new york observer has drawn criticism of his own for calling mccarthy a \" tractor-sized \" \" female hippo \" who \" has devoted her short career to being obese and obnoxious with equal success. \" many have decried the review as sexist. \" have you ever read a review where a male actor was described this way? \" asks adriana velez at the stir, pointing out the host of plus-sized male comedians who haven't faced that kind of ridicule. Meanwhile manohla dargis at the new york times thinks mccarthy is the best part of the movie, \" the supernova who burns up this show. \" but ultimately this is \" a lazy comedy \" that isn't subversive enough to really cut her loose. \" order must be restored, the family reunited, the wild woman tamed. \" everyone must learn a lesson, \" and then everything will fit tidily, phonily together. \"",

        "summary": "San bernardino shooter syed rizwan farook may have been planning mass murder even before he married accomplice tashfeen malik, according to sources close to the investigation. Officials tell cnn that farook plotted to carry out an attack with somebody else in california in 2012, though it's not clear how far the preparations went. The plan was called off after a round of terror-related arrests in the area \" spooked \" farook and his accomplice, one source says. Law enforcement officials tell nbc news that farook and malik appeared to have planned the san bernardino attack for at least a year, training at local gun ranges and making financial arrangements for their 6-month-old daughter and farook's mother. The fbi is still investigating a loan of $ 28,500 deposited into farook's account two weeks before the attack, a loan that an investigator tells nbc \" would be consistent with them making preparations for grandma and the kid. \" in other developments: the los angeles times reports that former minneapolis resident mohamed abdullahi hassan, an alleged isis recruiter who targeted westerners on social media, has surrendered to authorities in somalia. Investigators suspect he may have influenced farook. The san bernardino department of public health, which employed farook and most of the 14 people killed in the attack, trained employees last year for an active-shooter drill in the same room at the inland regional center that farook and malik attacked, the ap reports. \" everyone was trying to be quiet and not draw attention to themselves as they were trained to do, to try to find as much protection as you can, \" an assistant director of the department says. \" unfortunately, the room just didn't provide a whole lot of protection. \" law enforcement sources tell the times that a device farook and malik left behind at the scene of the attack may have been designed to kill first responders. The sources say the crude device, which included three pipe bombs, was disabled by water from the building's sprinkler system. See a photo of the holiday party taken just before the shooting here.",

So report researchers at indiana university bloomington in the journal computers in human behavior after analyzing both the messages being sent and the physical state of those doing the sending. Contrary to previous research and conventional wisdom suggesting that a voicemail message is more intimate than email, this study finds that, at least among the 72 college-age millennials analyzed, the act of writing produced in the sender far more emotional arousal and greater use of emotional language. The effect endures, too, since people tend to respond to messages using the same medium, thus the recipient may in turn experience similarly heightened emotions when replying, reports pacific standard. \" when writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium's inability to convey vocal tone, \" dennis and wells wrote in the paper. \" senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails. This extra processing may increase arousal. \" what's more, the students they studied have, they feel, adapted to the medium. \" if you look at the new generation of millennials, and that's who we studied, they've grown up with email and text messaging, \" one researcher says. \" so it may not be as unnatural a medium as we at first thought. \" or, perhaps, voicemail is just more awkward.

Kare reports that as minnesota's juneski was puzzling over her test results from 23andme, a woman in a nearby town in wisconsin took her own dna test. Linda jourdeans'results showed that \" m. Mayer \" was her mother — but that wasn't the woman who had raised her, she tells kare. The murkiness of this all soon cleared up: juneski and jourdeans had been somehow switched at birth sometime after being born on dec. 19, 1945, at bethesda hospital in st. Paul, minn. The news offered context for things both women had long noticed: juneski was the only blonde among redheads and brunettes, while jourdeans, a redhead, was surrounded by lighter-haired kin. Juneski said she also felt out of place in a family of athletes, while jourdeans was the only athlete in her family. The women tracked each other down in april and have since met a few times, and they're celebrating their special new bond. \" i consider it a gift, \" juneski says. Together, the women visit one other person at her memory care facility: 99-year-old marianne mayer, the woman who raised juneski and is jourdeans ' biological mother. Rochelle nielsen, juneski's biological mother and the mom who raised jourdeans, died of cancer when jourdeans was 17. ( were these birth switches done on purpose? )",

The shootings took place at three homes saturday night — two in brookhaven and one in bogue chitto — about 70 miles south of jackson, after authorities got a call about a domestic dispute, the mississippi bureau of investigation said. The dead included two boys, investigators said. Godbolt was listed in good condition at a hospital with a gunshot wound; authorities did not say how he was wounded. Bureau of investigation spokesman warren strain said charges had yet to be filed and it was too soon to say what the motive was. Authorities gave no details on the relationship between godbolt and the victims. However, godbolt himself shed some light on what happened in a video interview with the newspaper as he sat with his hands cuffed behind his back on the side of a road. Godbolt said he was talking with his wife and in-laws when somebody called authorities. \" i was having a conversation with her stepdaddy and her mama and her, my wife, about me taking my children home, \" he said. \" somebody called the officer, people that didn't even live at the house. That's what they do. They intervene. \" \" they cost him his life, \" he said, apparently referring to the deputy. \" i ' m sorry. \" the stepfather-in-law, vincent mitchell, said in an interview that godbolt's wife and their two children had been staying at his bogue chitto home for about three weeks after she left her husband.",

But there's a big caveat: \" we don't have archaeological proof of the fort at this time, \" says fsu's fletcher crowe.

For instance, they say native americans near the fort spoke a language known as guale, and those speakers lived around what is now darien, ga., near the newly proposed site. It's definitely \" provocative, \" a university of north florida archeologist in the jacksonville camp tells the florida times-union.

The 35-year-old california man was sentenced to more than 21 years in prison friday after pleading guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to distribute drugs, reports the washington post. His fall from grace is a wild tale: while at usc in 2004, hanson began selling drugs, including cocaine and steroids, rolling stone previously reported. After college, he started working as a bookie in los angeles. Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler rj cipriani, that hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in australia, per 9 news. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from hanson's illegal dealings in australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in la. Cipriani claims he figured this all out and was purposefully reckless at the casino tables to get out of the arrangement; he ended up losing $ 2.5 million. But his escape plan wasn't that easy. Cipriani says hanson threatened him and his wife, including by sending them a video of two men being beheaded. \" if you don't pay us our money, this will happen to you, \" an attached note read, according to prosecutors. The us gambler eventually went to the fbi and hanson was arrested in 2015 in a joint operation with australian police. He pleaded guilty in january, and has now been ordered to forfeit $ 5 million in assets. More than 20 of hanson's associates have also been charged with crimes related to gambling and drug trafficking.",

Sources tell the washington post and cnn that on saturday morning — the first morning of his presidency — trump contacted michael t. Reynolds, the national park service's acting director, to demand more photos of the crowd on the national mall. Reynolds, who has worked for the service for 30 years, was \" taken aback \" by the request, but he sent some aerial photos to trump, according to the post's sources. The photos did not, however, provide proof of trump's claim that more than a million people had gathered to watch his inauguration. Reynolds and the nps have declined to comment, but insiders say trump also expressed anger over an nps tweet comparing his crowd to obama's, which apparently led to an order for all interior department accounts to stop tweeting. White house deputy press secretary sarah huckabee sanders confirmed that trump contacted the nps. She said the call demonstrated the president is \" so accessible, and constantly in touch. \" \" he's not somebody who sits around and waits. He takes action and gets things done, \" she said. \" that's one of the reasons that he is president today, and hillary clinton isn't. \" ( trump was still talking about the size of his inaugural crowd on wednesday, when he gave his first interview as president. )",

The man and woman were found at the site of an ancient chapel in hallaton, along with nine other skeletons, reports the leicester mercury. The couple appear to be the same age, but scientists plan further study to see whether they can determine the cause of death. They also hope to determine why the bodies were buried at this particular site, quite a distance away from a \" perfectly good church in hallaton, \" says a lead researcher from the university of leicester. Leading theories are that the burial site was used for those who were either sick, criminals, or foreign pilgrims. One man at the site apparently died of a head wound, perhaps from a pole ax in battle, while another had his legs raised to his chest, possibly because of a disease of some kind. Researchers hope further work at the chapel can fill in a gap of about 500 years when not much is known about what went on in the region, reports the international business times.

        "summary": "Twelve days remain in the fiscal year, and the threat of a second government shutdown in three years remains very much in play. The big problem remains a showdown over funding for planned parenthood, with conservative republicans who are upset about recent undercover videos demanding that the group lose all federal funds. With the clock ticking, party leaders still have \" no concrete plan \" to avoid the shutdown, reports politico. One possibility is to pass a temporary measure before the end of the month to allow more time for negotiations in the fall, but that's not a slam dunk — because house conservatives demand that even such a continuing resolution block planned parenthood funding, reports the hill. They're also threatening to try to oust john boehner — who opposes abortion and planned parenthood but doesn't want to hand democrats a potential gift in the form of a shutdown — as speaker if he backs down. The ap sees a possible way out of what it calls this \" political rubik's cube. \" house leaders are pushing through a number of abortion-related measures, including one that passed today to defund planned parenthood for a year. The measures stand virtually no chance of becoming law, but leaders hope they will be enough to mollify the conservative rank-and-file. It \" remains unclear \" whether that will be the case, however, notes the washington post. Lawmakers are in session only five more days until the deadline, and about the only safe bet is that the drama will go down to the final day, if not hour.",

The fixes aren't exactly high-tech: north korean soldiers were seen digging a big trench in the border area where the soldier first drove and then ran to freedom, reports reuters. They also planted trees, apparently to prevent vehicles from getting through in the future. Finally, north korea also seems to have replaced all of its border security guards, reports the yonhap news agency, which surmises that any officers involved are in for serious punishment. Details and developments: the soldier: \" he's a pretty nice guy, \" the lead south korean surgeon says of the 24-year-old defector, identified only by the name \" oh. \" the patient likes bruce almighty and csi, though usa today notes it's unclear whether he saw that us movie and show in the hospital or previously in north korea on the black market. Oh faces a long recuperation, having been shot at least five times. One bullet decimated his colon. The surgeon: the incident has put the spotlight, again, on 48-year-old trauma surgeon lee cook-jong. Lee is the one giving regular updates after the surgeries he performs, and the washington post reports that he previously became a \" national hero \" in 2011 when he saved the life of a ship captain shot by somali pirates. That feat became the subject of a medical drama. Lee, blind in one eye, also served as the inspiration for a character in a second drama called romantic doctor, teacher kim, which was released last year and gave him certifiable celeb status. The post uses the terms \" heartthrob \" and \" mcdreamy \" in the profile. Next for oh: the surgeon, taking note of oh's \" jarhead \" haircut, jokingly suggested that oh eventually join the south korean military: \" he smiled and said that he would never ever go back to the military system again. \" when he's stronger, oh will be debriefed. Then he ' ll get help with housing, education, and job training from the south korean government, reports the guardian.",

Wob says on their website: \"we're inviting a team of interns to travel the world, hopping from brewery to brewery, wob tavern to wob tavern to explore beer for themselves and share their stories with wob drinkers across the country. \" can this possibly be for real? alyssa ahern, a wob representative, told us that world of beer came up with the internship — which is being offered this year for the first time ever — because the company is all about providing a global experience. \"our mantra is 'drink it in, ' and so 'drink it intern ' was just a natural extension of what wob stands for, \" she said.

Pictures on her facebook and formspring accounts look pretty close to the blurred images offered up on the dirty when it broke the sexting story, and she's talked about weiner quite a bit online ( often on accounts that are now deleted ). For example, in a june 2011 facebook post, she declared: \" rep. Weiner can continue sending dick pics every single day for the rest of his life as long as he continues to legislate like he does. I decided. \" her twitpic account identifies her as an obama for america field organizer. She also listed weiner as one of her heroes, wrote at least one blog post about his resignation, and said on facebook that he shouldn't have resigned. An anonymous source confirms buzzfeed got the id right and says he or she saw the messages exchanged a year ago, but a buzzfeed reporter asked weiner last night if he knew leathers and — shocker — got no response. The source, who says he or she has known leathers since high school, says she \" felt she was the important one \" to weiner, even more important than wife huma abedin. As for abedin, daily intel notes that she came to a \" prescient conclusion \" in september's harper's bazaar: \" people have said many things about my husband — some nice, some not so nice. And that will surely continue. Launching this campaign was not an easy decision for our family to make. Putting yourself out there comes with a cost. \" ( meanwhile, \" cubicle guy \" has become a viral sensation after weiner's press conference last night. )",

        "summary": "\" are we really willing to risk los angeles or chicago in retaliation for an attack on a us military base in the region? probably not, \" nuclear strategy specialist vipin narang tells the ap. And that's exactly the calculation that gives north korea a small shot at \" winning \" in a nuclear conflict, challenging the assumption that launching a nuclear weapon would be automatic suicide for the country. If north korea feels threatened to the point of using a nuclear weapon, a first target would likely be a us military base in japan; north korea would then use its long-range nukes to threaten the us mainland and avoid a retaliatory strike. Experts say this is kim jong un's \" theory of victory \" — one that president trump may be attempting to combat with an unsuccessful version of the \" madman strategy. \" here's what else you need to know about north korea's most-recent missile launch: tuesday's missile launch over japan seems likely to result in even more sanctions against north korea. But after un sanctions aug. 5 targeted millions of dollars in seafood, coal, iron ore, and more, is there anything left to sanction? cnn reports two options are oil and chinese banks. After tuesday's missile launch, trump said \" all options are on the table. \" this was, all things considered, a \" measured \" response from the president, according to the atlantic. It was an official statement instead of a tweet, didn't threaten \" fire and fury, \" and avoided calling kim jong un a \" wack job. \" the guardian reports on the scary morning had by residents of japan, who were awoken around 6am tuesday by a government missile warning on their phones. They were given less than 10 minutes to get to a shelter or sturdy building as sirens and special broadcasts blared. The missile test impacted us markets, with the dow dropping more than 100 points tuesday morning, reuters reports. The stock market would recover by the afternoon as the threat passed. Korea expert stephan haggard tells the washington post that tuesday was another example of how \" weirdly conservative \" kim jong un is — carrying out provocative actions with just enough restraint to avoid an actual response. For example, pointing the missile toward japan, not guam. Finally, russia's deputy foreign minister blamed the us and south korea for tuesday's nuclear test and came out against further sanctions against north korea, saying they haven't prevented missile tests in the past and won't in the future, newsweek reports.",

Corrine brown's \" one door for education \" charity raised $ 833,000 between 2012 and 2016 to award scholarships to disadvantaged students — but prosecutors say only $ 1,200 was spent on a total of two scholarships. Brown, a democrat who represented a florida district in congress for 24 years, is facing years in prison after being found guilty on 18 of 22 federal fraud charges, wjct reports. Prosecutors said brown and aide elias simmons siphoned off the rest of the money raised by the sham charity, spending it on travel, lavish parties, and luxuries like private boxes for nfl games and a beyonce concert, npr reports. Prosecutors accused the 70-year-old of choosing \" greed and personal gain \" over public service. She \" shamefully deprived needy children of hundreds of thousands of dollars that could have helped with their education and improved their opportunities for advancement, \" said acting assistant attorney general kenneth blanco, per the tampa bay times. Brown, who lost her re-election bid after she was indicted last year, maintained her innocence and blamed the theft on simmons. He pleaded guilty to fraud and testified against brown, as did the charity's president, carla wiley, the ap reports. All three will be sentenced at a later date.",

The strange case began in june when police in casselberry charged sarah markham with neglect and took away 2-week-old caleb. The charges came after a pediatrician diagnosed caleb as dehydrated and underweight, and told markham to take him to the hospital immediately, recounts wkmg. Instead, markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a seminole county judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \" there's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect — there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it, \" says caleb's grandfather, bo markham. The child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother's care, and now weighs about 17 pounds. \" he's still on a soy formula, \" says bo markham. The criminal neglect charges are still pending, though sarah markham's attorney — mark o ' mara, who defended george zimmerman — says he expects they will be dismissed now.

A cousin says per espn fc the remains were removed from a grave in a cemetery near rio 10 years ago, after another family member was buried there. Garrincha's bones were supposed to be transferred to a niche, but cemetery officials concede they have no idea if that ever happened. \" it's very upsetting not knowing where he is, \" says daughter rosangela santos. Cemeteries in brazil are typically divided into two parts, one with tombs and another with concrete niches set like drawers into walls, per the bbc. Two tombs carry garrincha's name: the original grave where he was laid to rest in 1983, and a second one constructed in 1985 and marked with an obelisk. If the family agrees, mage mayor rafael tubarao says he ' ll order an exhumation of the graves and dna tests of any bones. Garrincha, a nickname meaning \" little wren \" in brazil's portuguese dialect, is widely revered as the nation's greatest dribbler of all time. As one of pele's teammates, he helped the soccer-crazed nation clinch the world cup in 1958 and 1962. He died at the age of 49 after years of heavy drinking.

Itzcoatl ocampo, a 25-year-old iraq veteran, had yet to stand trial for the stabbing murders of four homeless men he apparently picked at random and a mother and son he was acquainted with.

After the former marine's arrest, family members said he had been kind and generous to the homeless but prosecutors painted a different picture, saying ocampo saw the homeless as a blight on society and had set a target of 16 murders.

A spokesperson for bmw told the times the company isn't planning on selling its domain and that alphabet was a large part of its business.

            "As sergey and i wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, \"google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one. \" as part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make \"smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses. \" from the start, we've always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. More we did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like google maps, youtube, chrome, and android. And we haven't stopped there. We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about. We've long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable",
            "Google has bought the alphabet. Not literally of course ( if that's even possible ), but it has acquired the domain name abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com, just a few days after google officially became a subsidiary of alphabet, its new holding company. The domain was created in 1999 and was updated on wednesday when google took control of it, according to domain database whois. It is unclear how much it was bought for.

        "summary": "Like snacking on dark chocolate? then we hope you're not doing it to avoid milk, because the us food and drug administration tested 94 dark-chocolate bars and found milk in 61 % of them, quartz reports — including not just products with descriptions like \" may contain milk \" or \" may contain traces of milk, \" but ones that claim to be vegan, dairy-free, or lactose-free. What if the label doesn't mention milk at all? yep, the agency found milk in 33 % of those cases. Of 88 bars that didn't list milk as an ingredient, 51 included milk. The fda undertook the project after consumers complained about reacting badly to dark chocolate. Sure enough, it's hard to find a dairy-free heaven in dark-chocolate land: \" this can be a problem, since even one small bite of a product containing milk can cause a dangerous reaction in some individuals, \" a researcher tells yahoo. The fda detected milk in 75 % of dark-chocolate products labeled \" may contain milk, \" \" manufactured in a facility that uses milk, \" or similar, and found that certain products \" had milk levels as high as those found in products that declared the presence of milk, \" the agency says, noting that consumers should \" read ' may ' as ' likely ' \" on such labels. What's more, 15 % of dark-chocolate bars with labels reading \" dairy-free \" or \" lactose-free \" contained milk, as did 25 % claiming to be \" vegan. \" so what's up? many companies make dark and milk chocolate on the same machines: \" and remember, they use a lot of powdered milk products in the chocolate industry, so powder can blow, it can get stuck to equipment, \" an allergist tells cbs pittsburgh. Those in dire need of milk-free dark chocolate should find \" a trusted source of allergen-free chocolate, \" says yahoo, which advises people to \" proceed with caution. \" ( if you're not allergic to milk, though, chow down. )",
