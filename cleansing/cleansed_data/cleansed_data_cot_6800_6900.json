As for bell, her instagram pic featured an even larger pore strip and a strange lip covering, accompanied by the caption: \" i have serious doubts this is actually a lip conditioning sticker my makeup artist... Applied over my mouth.

        "summary": "In what police are calling the first death of its kind in singapore, a longtime professional diver was killed by a stingray tuesday at a shuttered aquarium, the bbc and reuters report. Philip chan, 62, who'd worked at underwater world since it opened its doors in 1991, was the venue's head diver until it closed down in june, the victim of competition with other local aquariums, but he had stayed behind with nearly a dozen other workers to care for the animals while new homes for them were sought, says a spokesperson from haw par corporation, the aquarium's parent company. Per the new paper, police say they responded to a call about an injured man shortly after 2pm tuesday, and he died after being taken to a local hospital. A haw par statement says chan was struck in the chest by the stingray, reports the independent. Chan's death is reminiscent of that of australian wildlife expert steve irwin, who was stabbed hundreds of times and killed by a stingray in 2006. A marine scientist tells the new paper that while the animals aren't usually aggressive, stingrays in captivity being moved from one place to another might feel threatened and lash out with the poisonous barbs on their spine. Chan called the animals at the park his \" babies \" and could often be spotted decked out in his scuba gear in the tanks, placing food in the mouths of the stingrays and sharks while visitors snapped photos. Condolences for chan have been popping up on facebook, with one user calling chan \" the pillar who stood strong and tall since day one of laying the aquarium's foundations, \" per the independent. The police say they're investigating chan's \" unnatural death, \" and the haw par rep says the animal transfer efforts have been put on hold.",

According to a facebook post from donna beegle, the family was on its way home to oregon from walt disney world when 15-year-old juliette became upset because she hadn't eaten during a layover in houston, nbc news reports. After being told that hot food was only available to first-class passengers, beegle, who was in economy class, explained to a flight attendant that her daughter might have a \" meltdown \" if she couldn't get some. She tells kgw that after a meal arrived, there was an announcement that there would be an emergency landing because of a passenger's behavioral problem. The parents and their two children were ordered off the plane by police officers when the plane landed in salt lake city. \" as a mom, it ripped my heart out, \" beegle tells kgw. \" i was shaking. \" she says her daughter has flown many times before without a problem. She tells koin that the family was kicked off the plane because of \" ignorance \" and \" the fear of autism. \" she says she plans to file a lawsuit not for money, but to make sure airline staff receive the proper training in dealing with autistic passengers. In a statement, united said the \" crew made the best decision for the safety and comfort of all of our customers \" after \" the situation became disruptive. \" ( an autistic 11-year-old boy was found safe five days after he wandered away from a campground. )",

The sheboygan parks chief says the perp isn't flushing the bottles, but rather cramming them into the toilet pipe — about 12 times in 2016, 14 times last year, and at least three times already in 2018. And it's proven an expensive infraction, with the city in some cases having to remove the toilet to remove the bottles; it has spent as much as $ 3,000 on the issue. The same thing has also happened at another public facility, though not to the same extent. There aren't cameras in the center's public women's restroom, but there are some nearby, and the footage suggests a man may be entering the bathroom to do the dirty work. A local mom tells wtmj that the constantly out-of-order bathroom isn't only inconvenient for the city's wallet, but also for mothers with young children who have to use that bathroom when they're near the community center along lake michigan. \" i don't even know where the other nearest bathroom is, so it's a real pain when we can't use this. … as taxpayers, we pay for that, \" she says, adding: \" i really hope they catch whoever is doing this.

        "summary": "The good news: hundreds of ms-13 gang members have been arrested over the past few years. The bad news: those gang members are now wreaking havoc in the prisons they're in, perpetrating acts of violence and extortion to gain control over their locked-down domains. The washington post details the increasing number of gang fights and attacks resulting from ms-13's desire to take charge of their surroundings. \" ms-13 presents unique challenges … to the correctional system, \" the head of maryland's corrections system says. The post notes that as the percentage of ms-13 members in prisons ' overall populations rises — local prisons the paper surveyed report double-digit percent increases in ms-13 inmates over the past two years — so do the problems as the ms-13ers get into \" turf wars \" with members of other gangs like the bloods, crips, and aryan brotherhood. In the case of one maryland prison, ms-13 members even started imposing a \" tax \" on fellow inmates ( usually hispanics ), offering them protection in exchange for commissary goods. Other inmates eventually balked, immediately attacking any ms-13 member transferred to their unit as a preemptive strike. Prison officials try to separate ms-13 members so they can't work together, and also attempt to keep them away from rival gangs, as there are often \" jump on sight \" directives when rivals are spotted. Sometimes ms-13 members, often in prison for extended periods due to the serious nature of their crimes, have to be transferred to another prison to remedy the issues. Check out the post for its interviews with a handful of the alleged gang members, as well as the new york times for why president trump referenced the gang in his state of the union speech.",

Denis st. Claire says he found the face on reeks island but the rugged shoreline made a close examination nearly impossible, so parks canada alerted the local aboriginal group, tseshaht first nation. Intrigued, tseshaht beachkeeper hank gus began searching for the mysterious \" face in the rocks \" two years ago and finally found it on june 3, reports ha-shilth-sa. Some 40 feet up an inaccessible rock cliff, a 7-foot face gazes out at passersby. \" we went out to see it recently, and it's remarkable, \" parks canada rep matthew payne tells abc news. \" it really is a face staring back at you. \" parks canada and tseshaht first nation now hope to determine if the face is manmade or natural. \" we are working with the first nations to find out if there are any oral histories the face could link back to, \" payne says. \" in my years of working with many elders during the 1970s and 1980s none of them ever referred to a rock face carving, \" gus says. However, he suggests the face bears a similarity to a carving by tseshaht artist gordon dick. His carving of a blowing face, named ubi, represents \" sharing the history of our ancestors and keeping it alive, \" gus tells ctv news. \" it's something really similar to this face in the rock. \" the archaeologist who first saw the face notes \" it certainly looks purposefully made, but nature can play tricks on us. \" he adds a \" close-up viewing is necessary to see if there were tell-tale signs of rock modification. \" until such an inspection is possible, gus says he's happy just sharing the mystery with others.",

But there was another woman in my life named sara, who shortly after that became mick's wife, sara fleetwood. \" so henley's story about the song \" sara \" was \" accurate, \" nicks said, \" but not the entirety of it. \" gawker fills in some of the backstory: according to marc eliot's book about the eagles, nicks and henley had \" a serious two-year affair, \" but when nicks got pregnant, \" the'situation ' was resolved quickly and quietly when nicks, between tour dates, had an abortion. Although henley did not try to force the issue, according to friends, she was deeply upset about what she considered his fast and easy consent to her decision. Nicks took it as henley's way of saying he wasn't interested in any type of serious long-term commitment. \" in henley's interview years later, according to a 2006 book excerpted here, he said nicks \" named the [ unborn ] kid sara, and she had an abortion — and then wrote the song of the same name to the spirit of the aborted baby. \"",

The documentary titanic: the new evidence aired sunday, and it puts forth the theory that the ship was handicapped before it even encountered the iceberg that sent it to its doom. The telegraph reports irish journalist senan molony has spent three decades researching the ship, and is focusing on photos found in an album that was auctioned in 2012; they show what he says are 30ft-long black marks along the front right-hand side of the hull, where the ship eventually collided with the iceberg. The photos were taken before the titanic left the belfast shipyard, and molony says the marks resulted from what is a well-documented fire that burned for days in a three-story-high coal storage bunker behind boiler room six. Molony believes the intense heat from the fire — with temps hitting 1,800 degrees fahrenheit — warped the bulkhead steel, sapping its strength by as much as 75 %. That \" led to an accelerated sinking \" upon collision. \" titanic couldn't stay afloat long enough for an effective rescue, \" he says, per cnn. Molony also points out that the ship oddly reversed into her berth, which he says kept the streaked side hidden from boarding passengers, reports the times of london. Jalopnik notes molony isn't the first to air a fire-related theory. In 2004, engineer robert essenhigh presented his theory to the geological society of america: that the ship tore through an iceberg field in the dark at full speed because the crew had sped up the rate at which the already burning coal was shoveled from the bunker into the steam engine boiler as a method of getting rid of it.

Though libyan rebels are likely to scoff at the suggestion, the government is playing on fears of instability and warns that without gadhafi, the nation could fall into chaos similar to what happened in iraq.

His government has lost control, is bombed nightly, and is dealing with fuel shortages and lessening popular support. By allowing him to remain in the country as a figurehead, the government's proposal will ensure that gadhafi escapes the any arrest warrants that could come from the international criminal court. The government is counting on the fact that nato will eventually grow weary of bombing and become open to negotiation, analysts say. Interestingly, the independent has a copy of a different proposal — this one from libya's prime minister — that offers a ceasefire, talks with the opposition, amnesty, and a new constitution, but does not mention gadhafi's role.",

Tim o ' flaherty, a democrat, sponsored a house bill to repeal the statute, which dates back to the early 1800s, the ap reports. The house passed the bill, and the state senate today did the same, usa today reports; the governor has said she will likely sign it, meaning it would go into effect january 1. Adultery is currently a misdemeanor punishable by a fine as high as $ 1,200. O ' flaherty held a public hearing last month on his measure, and the only person to argue in favor of keeping the adultery ban was a man who once attempted to file a criminal adultery complaint against his wife; she was never charged with a crime. His argument: \" if we retain adultery as a crime, we may deter an otherwise law-abiding citizen... From falling into the trap of that repugnant behavior. \" ( maybe he's also the guy who wrote this letter to the editor arguing for the ban to remain intact? ) interestingly, the anti-adultery law defines adultery as between a man and a woman: \" intercourse from which spurious issue [ a child born out of wedlock ] may arise. \" adultery is currently a crime in 21 states.",

        "summary": "It's one bit of good news after this week's massacre at a college in kenya: a 19-year-old woman was found hiding in a cupboard this morning two days after the attack. Cynthia cheroitich initially refused to come out even as rescuers pleaded with her, reports ap. \" how do i know that you are the kenyan police? \" she asked. Finally, one of her teachers arrived and convinced her to emerge, but it's tough to blame her: survivors have described how the gunmen at garissa university college told students to leave their dorms, promised they would be unharmed, and then executed them. Often, they taunted their victims before shooting them — in some cases, ordering the students to call their parents beforehand, reports the new york times. The death toll is now at 148. Other developments: five arrests: so far, five suspects have been arrested, including two men found at the college. One is a campus security guard, osman ali dagane, whose arrest suggests the al-shabab militants had inside help. The other is a tanzanian national identified as rashid charles mberesero, reports afp. Three other suspects were caught attempting to cross into somalia. Suspected mastermind: kenyan authorities think the mastermind is a former kenyan teacher named mohamed mohamud, also known as dulyadin gamadhere, believed to be in somalia. They've offered a $ 220,000 bounty. Local gunmen? survivors say they heard the gunmen speaking in fluent swahili, which the bbc notes is an official language of kenya and suggests at least some were locals and not from somalia as widely believed. Another threat: a statement from al-shabab today promised more attacks in kenya and a \" long, gruesome war \" in retaliation for the country's incursion into somalia in 2011. It promised to fight \" until all muslim lands are liberated from kenyan occupation. Until then, kenyan cities will run red with blood. \"",

        "summary": "What to do when a wheeled suitcase hits a bump in the road and starts to wobble? walk a little faster. Yes, this is a question scientists have recently looked into, and they've got a couple pieces of advice for travelers. \"if it's not wobbling, it's better to walk slower, but if it starts then it's bad to slow down, \" says sylvain courrech du pont of paris diderot university. It all started when he assigned an experiment on the physics question to an undergrad class, only to learn that no previous research on it seemed to exist. So he and his colleagues took it upon themselves, using tiny model suitcases on a treadmill and theoretical calculations to sort out why the wobble and how to correct it, reports new scientist. If the disruption to the wheels is small enough, it ' ll self-correct quickly. If it's large enough, it ' ll rock harder until it falls over. And right in the middle, there's actually a sweet spot, they report in the proceedings of the royal society a, where it could theoretically wobble forever, though uneven surfaces and gaits make this highly unlikely in the real world. In the scenario where the disruption is large enough to fully topple the suitcase, the best way to prevent this is to walk faster. Holding the the suitcase handle lower also seems to help, though phys.org notes that doing both simultaneously \" would require some degree of athleticism. \" the researchers mention speed skaters in the study: the faster and lower they move, the more stable they become.

The story involves extortion, illegality and reckless behavior, sufficient justification at least in tabloid news terms. The account was true and well-reported. It concerns a senior business executive at one of the most powerful media companies on the planet.

I cannot blame our editors and writers for pursuing that original mission. But the media environment has changed, our readers have changed, and i have changed. Not only is criticism of yesterday's piece from readers intense, but much of what they've said has resonated. Some of our own writers, proud to work at one of the only independent media companies, are equally appalled. I believe this public mood reflects a growing recognition that we all have secrets, and they are not all equally worthy of exposure. I can't defend yesterday's story as i can our coverage of bill o'reilly, hillary clinton or hulk hogan. We are proud of running stories that others shy away from, often to preserve relationships or access. But the line has moved. And gawker has an influence and audience that demands greater editorial restraint. Advertisement gawker is no longer the insolent blog that began in 2003. It does important and interesting journalism about politicians, celebrities and other major public figures.

            "Tokyo electric power co. Officials underestimated fukushima fishermen's anger and distrust toward the company whose failures continue to threaten their livelihoods. After meeting fisheries leaders several times since last summer, utility officials believed they had won approval from a prefectural fisheries federation for a plan to reduce the amount of contaminated water at the stricken fukushima no. 1 nuclear plant. However, the fishermen themselves lashed out against tepco at a meeting in iwaki, fukushima prefecture, on may 13. \"an explanation from tepco alone will not be enough to win the confidence of union members, \" a participant at the meeting said. Tepco officials emphasized the safety of its plan to pump up groundwater at the plant and release it into the ocean before it can flow into the basements of reactor and turbine buildings and mix with highly radioactive water accumulated there. Some leaders of the fukushima prefectural federation of fisheries co-operative associations had agreed with tepco's plan. However, opposition from rank-and-file members was so great that the federation ended up rejecting tepco plan. Some members said that any water from the plant dumped into the sea would spread fears about the safety of their catches. Officials of the fukushima prefectural government and the central government's fisheries agency also attended the meeting. Fishermen in the tohoku region, especially fukushima prefecture, have been trying to regain a sense of normalcy in their operations since the great east japan earthquake and tsunami on march 11, 2011, led to the triple meltdown at the plant. Weeks after the accident, the utility announced that highly radioactive water had leaked from the reactor buildings into the sea, contaminating the sea bed and fish. The company also released several thousand tons of contaminated water into the ocean in the early stages of the crisis. Fukushima prefecture has been fighting an uphill battle to convince the public that its products are safe from radiation contamination. However, every report about water leaking or being released from the nuclear plant fuels fears of radiation and raises alarm among the local fishermen.

Tanis ukena was arrested aug. 8 in layton, utah, after a uniformed police officer who'd consumed part of a subway drink and sandwich reported feeling intoxicated. Ukena tells ksl he \" went into shock \" when officers arrested him after he'd helped them search the subway location \" for an hour or two. \" authorities at the time claimed an ion scanner test showed the officer's drink was laced with thc and methamphetamine and surveillance footage showed the crime unfold. However, utah state crime lab tests were \" unable to confirm that contaminates [ sic ] were in the officer's drink, \" police say. Urine and blood tests showed no drugs in the officer's system and \" extensive medical testing \" offered no clues to his condition, reports the standard-examiner. Ukena's lawyer says police initially used a \" cheap \" drug test, noting, \" the officer's symptoms did not correlate with the drugs, and that should have raised some red flags. \" he adds surveillance video shows ukena only holding the officer's drink. Ukena — who's considering legal action, per the standard-examiner — says he's still \" pro-police, \" but he fears \" this is going to affect me for years to come. \" since his arrest, he says he's received death threats and finds it \" scary to go out in public. \" an apology would be nice, he adds. In a statement, police noted their \" appreciation \" for his \" patience. \"",

Usa today has five takeaways from the speech, which include trump calling terrorists \" losers, \" iran a \" rogue nation, \" and venezuela a \" responsible neighbor and friend. \" while the north korean ambassador to the un walked out before trump's speech, a former cia analyst and expert on north korea tells the los angeles times how it's likely to play there: \"if i were kim jong un, i'd think, i better accelerate this thing and finish building my nuclear weapon before it's too late. These threats will only increase the hysteria and paranoia in north korea. \" meanwhile, french president emmanuel macron took issue with trump's stance on the iran nuclear deal, calling the deal \" essential for peace \" and saying scrapping it would be a \" grave error, \" the new york times reports. Macron also \" rejects escalation \" when it comes to north korea. In its look at the phrases trump used that \" matter most, \" cnn notes the president used \" sovereign \" or \" sovereignty \" 21 times. By doing so, trump made it clear that america is looking out for itself first and foremost. Writing for the washington post, ed rogers says he was pleasantly surprised by trump, who showed an \" unusual grasp of realism and relatively remarkable restraint. \" the former employee of the ronald reagan and george hw bush white houses says trump playing nice with the un is a possible result of stephen bannon leaving the administration. Finally, vanity fair calls trump's speech \" maniacal \" and \" warlike \" and one that despite all the president's bluster and bragging \" left him looking small \" in front of the international community.",

Trump, on the other hand, keeps running into problems like this one involving white supremacist david duke. But at usa today, tavis smiley writes that conventional wisdom doesn't apply to this election and that democrats will be making a serious \" miscalculation \" if they assume black voters will pick clinton. He lays out a few reasons, perhaps the most interesting being the silence he's noticed from the group he labels the bfots — black friends of trump. These are the \" black elite \" who travel in the same social circles as the billionaire. \" the relative silence of the black establishment class has been chilling, \" he writes.

They were ahead of the curve then, and they've stayed there – helping to usher in the era of online video in the 2000's, and now turning their sights to media's next frontier: subscription television. Digital media enables stars to reach their biggest fans directly on a smartphone or tablet – eliminating the network, studio, and cable system middlemen. Plummeting production costs mean that subscription channels built around ultra-niche personalities and their super-fans can become highly profitable in a very short time. Glenn beck, louis ck, jon stewart, rand paul, and wwe, among others, have all entered this lucrative arena.

            "Egypt's military chiefs pledged tuesday to speed up the transition to democratic rule, saying they will transfer power to an elected president by july 2012, a clear concession after four days of raucous street demonstrations. The move was announced by the country's military leader in his first national address since assuming power in february. But it appeared unlikely to deflate the anger of many of the tens of thousands of protesters on the streets of cairo and in other parts of the country who have been demanding the military council's immediate departure. Speaking on state television in his green army uniform, field marshal mohammed hussein tantawi appeared indignant, accusing demonstrators who have turned out in increasingly larger numbers of \"insulting \" the military. And he echoed the paternalism voiced by then-president hosni mubarak near the end of his three-decade rule, describing the armed forces ' hard work on behalf of the egyptian people during the challenging transition period that has followed mubarak's fall. A sea of protesters in tahrir square booed tantawi as he finished speaking, and they erupted in chants calling for his ouster — a scene almost identical to those that played out during mubarak's final days. But this time, it was unclear whether those who braved tear gas to demand a change in leadership had the backing of the rest of the nation. The dramatic events marked the most critical test yet of egypt's half-finished revolution, which has appeared orderly in contrast to the other arab spring uprisings that it helped spark, but which many egyptians see as too slow. And they deepened security concerns ahead of monday's parliamentary elections. The violent clashes between security forces and angry protesters have left 33 dead, at least 1,700 wounded and dozens under arrest. Among those detained were three americans studying",

That overcrowding was reportedly extreme: sometimes as many as 1,000 tourists on a beach there, one that has a capacity of 70 people. The guardian points to complaints of this nature on tripadvisor; one posted in february complains about the number of divers ( \" 8-10 boats here on most sites with circa 20 divers a boat \" ), which are driving away the manta rays. \" wake up national park admin... You are losing the attraction by allowing too many divers... It's not all about revenue! \" the review concludes. Point taken: closing the beach should \" allow the rehabilitation of the environment both on the island and in the [ andaman sea ], \" says netithammakul.",

Which is why pro mountaineers and local officials are worried about the 800 or so climbers expected to make the trip this year, upping the chances for dangerous \" traffic jams, \" the officials say. Some 371 foreigners have been issued climbing permits for 2017 — the highest number since 1953, per the post — with more than 400 sherpas also set to climb. Experts explain that waiting on the mountain behind other groups isn't just an eye-rolling inconvenience: with each extra minute spent not moving, climbers could fall prey to altitude sickness, risk getting frostbite, or use up too much of the oxygen needed to complete the trip. In a facebook post last week, uk mountaineer tim mosedale said he recently came across some \" fairly strange and indeed dangerous activity \" on everest: he describes one climber whose helmet was attached to his backpack rather than on his head and whose crampons were on the wrong feet ( \" his excuse was that he was in a rush to go to the toilet that morning \" ). Many people don't seem to realize that even the best mountain climbers can be no match for mother nature: swiss climber ueli steck, for instance, died just last week prepping for an everest climb. \" this is not alpinism, this is tourism, \" sniffs italian mountaineer reinhold messner, the first documented climber to reach the top of everest alone without supplemental oxygen, to the diplomat.

Sandeep mathrani, ceo of mall company general growth properties, spilled the beans on tuesday when the wall street journal asked him about developments in the mall business. \" you've got amazon opening brick-and-mortar bookstores and their goal is to open, as i understand, 300 to 400, \" said mathrani, noting that online retailers in areas including fashion and makeup are also opening stores in malls — and that having physical stores would allow amazon shoppers to drop off returns.

Amazon — which opened its first brick-and-mortar store in seattle in november — says it doesn't comment on \" rumors and speculation. \" investors appear to believe that opening a bookstore chain would hurt both amazon and its rivals: the journal reports that amazon and barnes &amp; noble shares both fell in after-hours trading.

The winner was to be given a 14-day internship at the plant and the title \" bouncer of energy, \" per 9news. Although cez later claimed the point of the contest was to \" promote technical education, \" controversy in the czech republic and online came quickly, with one internet user calling it \" degrading, disgusting, and primitive. \" the operators of the contest offered their mea culpa on facebook and said all 10 finalists would be receiving internships. In a press release, cez compared the bikini contest to its other cultural programs, such as the time it hosted a local philharmonic orchestra at the plant in south bohemia.",

A year later, a french fashion designer introduced a scanty two-piece bathing suit and named it the bikini. Unable to find a model immodest enough to wear it, he debuted it on a stripper - and it too became big news."

Though giraffes have a voice box, one line of thought was that due to their long necks it was too difficult for the creatures to generate the airflow needed to \" vibrate their vocal folds. \" but university of vienna researchers now say they've determined that giraffes do indeed \" produce vocalizations \" that may serve as a means of communication. The researchers recorded animals at three european zoos, amassing 947 hours of recordings over eight years. They then analyzed the recordings visually, in a process they describe in bmc research notes as \" time consuming, tedious, and very challenging. \" they believed the animals might produce \" infrasonic vocalizations \" — that is, below the level of human perception — and were looking for such low-frequency sounds. And they did indeed find \" structurally interesting humming vocalizations \" that occurred mainly at night and hovered around 92 hertz in frequency; as one new scientist commenter notes, they sound a little like the kraken ( listen for yourself here ). The hum isn't infrasound, but it's not exactly easy to hear either; wired notes the researchers shared the vocalizations with zookeepers, and the sound was unfamiliar to them. Though the researchers couldn't prove the sound is used for communication, they found \" suggestive hints \" that the hum might serves as a \" contact call, for example, to re-establish contact with herd mates. \" they speculate the hums may be occurring at night because giraffes'typically keen vision is less effective then. \" future studies should test in a well established experimental setting whether giraffes are more vocal when visual communication cues are absent, \" they conclude.

Since the affordable care act's inception in april 2013, the san francisco-based company has grown to more than 900 employees. That makes it the largest firm among dozens that have sprouted in the law's wake, according to pricewaterhousecoopers, which issued a report on the trend this week. The health law, which took full effect in 2014, represents the most dramatic change to the u.s. Health system in 50 years. Entrepreneurs, including some from within president barack obama's"

        "summary": "A seahorse's tail is a bizarre one in the animal kingdom because it's square — or more precisely, it's made up of about three dozen \" square plates, \" explains gizmodo. Why? researchers set out to discover just that with a method that sounds, well, pretty fun: they printed 3d replicas of the tail, along with round tails of a similar size, then took a mallet to them, popular science reports. In doing so, they realized the square version is harder to smash and \" tends to snap naturally back into place once it's been twisted and deformed, \" a researcher says, per livescience. That means in the wild, a square tail is more resilient when it suffers, say, a predator bite. The trade-off is that the plates cut motion in half, but the tail can still bend about 90 degrees. The flat surface of the tail also lets a seahorse get extra close to seaweed and coral, and is perfect for twisting and gripping, the study finds. What does that mean for us? well, researchers say in a post at eureka alert that the tail could provide \" inspiration for the next big technological breakthrough in robotics, defense systems, and biomedicine. \" they argue the superior square could be used to create stronger, more flexible robotic arms or even armor, particularly for a search-and-rescue \" snake \" robot that moves along the ground. Its body sections are susceptible to rips and tears, and \" the seahorse tail gives us an idea of how we might add armor on to these, \" a researcher says.

Bloomberg takes a look at the case of tarshema brice, a 34-year-old hairstylist and janitor in richmond who pleaded guilty last month to creating as much as $ 20,000 in phony bills over a two-year span. She \" was raising six children on her own with modest income and was filling the gaps by making counterfeit money, \" specifically $ 50 and $ 100 bills, says her lawyer. She's also \" emblematic \" of something much larger, per bloomberg: how easy digital technology has made it to churn out fake bills. You used to need a printing press; but in just 20 years, the percentage of such bills made on digital or laser printers and recovered by the feds has swelled from 1 % to almost 60 %. The secret to brice's success was that she started with real currency — watermarked $ 5 bills. But from there, her tools were pretty ordinary ones. She used purple power degreaser, heated the bills in a microwave, got the ink off with a toothbrush, then ran the paper through her printer, the richmond times-dispatch reported in december. The results of brice's work fooled local merchants and their counterfeit detection pens, although the watermark of lincoln was incorrect for the larger bills. She was caught by police with a fake bill last year and arrested along with three accomplices in september. As for the modest size of their scheme, an agent notes that technology has stripped away the need to create fake millions. \" depending on the technology you are using, you could just print up some [ money ] to go out on a friday night. \"",

        "summary": "The man-eating lions of tsavo, that pair of legendary beasts who killed about 35 railroad builders in kenya in 1898, have long been attached to one question: what caused them to turn to humans? more than a century later, researchers were able to use remains kept at chicago's field museum to arrive at an answer — or two. Bruce patterson and larisa desantis created dental molds and then casts of the lions'teeth, with those casts then subjected to tests designed to surface any microscopic wear. One prevailing theory was that the cats were so hungry due to a lack of prey they had to resort to eating men. Except the tooth damage you'd expect from crunching bones — consuming whole carcasses, not just fresh meat, would be natural in times of extreme hunger — just weren't there, per the study, published in scientific reports. Quite the contrary, their microwear was \" similar to what you'd see in a zoo lion, \" says desantis. But the teeth did give up a secret. The lion identified in a prior study as having eaten the most humans ( likely 24 ) had lost three lower right incisors and suffered from a canine-tooth root-tip abscess, which would have severely impaired its hunting ability. \" humans are so much easier to catch, \" says patterson. A press release explains the teeth of the second lion, believed to have eaten 11 humans, were in better shape. A second press release notes that we can only speculate about why the human bones weren't consumed: it may not have been feasible because of the dental disease, or the remains may have been recovered by survivors before the lions had finished. Regardless, the researchers say dental disease was probably a big factor. ( here's how a python can swallow a man whole. )",

In launching her campaign to be the state's top elections official, taitz is alleging that fellow republican candidate damon dunn, a former nfl player living in irvine, is ineligible to seek the gop nomination. She says he's committed voter and election fraud. Taitz told me this morning that she's running \"to clean up the fraud we all have seen in the 2008 election. It is important to bring legitimacy to elections. And i will be fighting to ensure the california corporations are not overburdened by regulations. \" taitz has seen the dismissal at least three lawsuits in which she's attempted to prove that obama is not a natural-citizen, alleging he may have been born in kenya and that even if he was born in the united states, having a kenyan father disqualified him. The native of the ussr, a naturalized u.s. Citizen, was sanctioned $ 20,000 for misconduct by one court, with the fine upheld by an appeals court on monday. One of her failed lawsuits asked secretary of state debra bowen to investigate obama's qualifications to be president. Taitz has repeatedly criticized bowen for not verifying obama status as a natural-born citizen. Bowen, a democrat, is expected to win reelection against the eventual gop nominee. Kelley said that taitz filed a complaint with his office, \"55 or 60 pages \" long. Among the allegations was that dunn was registered as a democrat within the last 12 months, which would disqualify him to seek the gop nomination, kelley said. Candidates must be registered for three months with the party they are running for, and cannot be registered for a different party for 12 months. Kelley said that dunn has been registered as a republican in orange county since march 17, 2009. That's just short of the 12-month mark given the march 12 filing deadline, but meets the three month requirement. Taitz offers evidence that dunn was registered to vote in jacksonville, florida, as a democrat. Dunn"

Democrats want rates increased for everyone making more than $ 250,000, but obama's latest proposal allowed an increase in that number to $ 400,000.

The vaccine, known as pfspz vaccine, was developed by scientists at sanaria inc., of rockville, md.

        "summary": "The $ 4.1 trillion budget sent to congress tuesday by president trump claims it will erase the national deficit by 2027, the ap reports. It will do this by drastically cutting programs for the poor, including medicaid and food stamps, as well as decreasing funding for medical research, highways, and more. Democrats are, not surprisingly, opposed to the budget, but even some republicans are distancing themselves from it. \" these cuts that are being proposed are draconian. They're not mere shavings, they're deep, deep cuts, \" says republican rep. Harold rogers of kentucky. Here's what else you need to know about trump's proposed budget: analysis in the washington post states trump's proposed budget takes from the poor to give to the rich — it includes massive tax cuts for wealthy americans and a $ 1.4 trillion cut to medicaid over the next decade — at a time when inequality in the us \" is already at historically elevated levels. \" but cuts alone aren't enough to balance the budget. Fivethirtyeight reports the other part of trump's proposed budget is rosy economic projections \" that have little basis in reality. \" the budget assumes economic growth of 3 % per year by the year 2021; most economists think that won't happen, and some federal agencies are projecting growth that's less than 2 %. The bbc reminds readers that trump's budget — which includes a 10 % increase in military spending and $ 1.6 billion for a border wall — is unlikely to become a reality as it stands, same as all other presidential budgets. The senate and house each pass their own version of the budget, then congressional committees hammer it all out. But slate argues that just because it's unlikely to pass as is, it doesn't make trump's proposed budget any less dangerous, calling it a \" permission slip \" to republicans in congress to attack the safety net: \" he's granting paul ryan permission to cut away. And that, ultimately, is what makes trump's budget so frightening. \" on the other hand, peter morici writes for marketwatch that trump's \" mad-genius budget \" is just what we need to \" avert fiscal calamity and restore prosperity and hope for the nation's most struggling citizens. \" he claims too many people are abusing social services like unemployment. Finally, new york points to what it characterizes as an \" embarrassing mistake \" in trump's proposed budget: it assumes a $ 2 trillion increase in government revenue through economic growth. That growth isn't",

The crescent-shaped structure just a few miles away from the sea of galilee is about 492 feet long and 23 feet high and — based on pottery found nearby — was likely built between 3050 bc and 2650 bc.

The hebrew university of jerusalem student who led the excavation surmises that the crescent shape may have been used because the lunar crescent symbolized sin, a mesopotamian moon god, and adds that the structure may have served as the border marking for a town located a day's walk away, whose name translates to \" house of the moon god. \" just as the world has always been fascinated with how the pyramids were built, the jethro cairn team set to work trying to figure out the man-hours that went into this project: they believe it took between 35,000 and 50,000 days — an effort scientists estimate would have taken 200 workers at least five months to complete.

        "summary": "The united states and several leading eu states appear poised to increase non-lethal aid to syrian opposition groups, adding equipment such as body armor and night-vision goggles, reports the wall street journal. Arms, however, remain off the table, as president obama fears they could fall into the hands of al-qaeda-affiliated groups. The white house is also reviewing military options, such as bombing syrian aircraft on the ground or adding patriot anti-missile batteries to turkey to defend against syrian rockets. \"it's not going to turn the tide in the battle, but of course it helps, \" one analyst tells the new york times. Over in europe, there are signs britain and france are interested in stepping up their assistance to rebel groups by letting the eu arms embargo against syria expire at the end of may. At a group of eight meeting in london yesterday, syrian opposition groups once again called for increased military assistance, asking for antiaircraft and antitank guns. The news comes as human rights watch declares more than 4,300 civilians have been killed in government airstrikes since july, al jazeera adds.",

In london, where the british foreign secretary, william hague, hosted a meeting with the syrian opposition on wednesday, there were signs that britain and france were prepared to let the european union arms embargo expire by the end of may so that they could increase their assistance. \"we certainly believe that it's necessary to continue, if the situation continues to deteriorate, to increase the practical help we give to the syrian opposition, \" mr.

        "summary": "The old-school incandescent bulb has been getting a bad rap, but mit researchers say they've figured out a way to make one that even al gore would embrace. In fact, their breakthrough could result in an incandescent bulb far more efficient than the more modern leds or compact fluorescents, reports the telegraph. Traditional incandescent bulbs are notoriously inefficient — electricity passes through a filament to create light, but more than 95 % of the energy is lost through heat. The mit researchers got around that by encasing the filament in \" photonic crystal \" that bounces the escaping energy back to the filament, which then reabsorbs it and converts it to light, reports upi. Think of it as \" light recycling, \" they explain in a post at mit. \" it recycles the energy that would otherwise be wasted. \" their working prototype raised the efficiency of the incandescent bulb to 6.6 %, which is roughly triple that of an unmodified incandescent and on par with the lower end of leds ( 5 % to 15 % ) and compact fluorescents ( 7 % to 13 % ), reports science. However, the researchers say their computer modeling suggests this procedure, which uses nanoengineered mirrors, could ultimately result in a whopping 40 % efficiency. Another real-world selling point: the incandescent emits its usual warm, natural glow, one that's generally seen as superior to the more modern bulbs. \" if the approach lives up to its promise, cutting-edge photonics could give edison's glowing filaments a new lease on life, \" writes robert service at science.",

Police said a homeless man found the dead child while he was rummaging through the trash behind a u-gas station at 5235 n.w. 7th avenue on sept. 5, 2014. Later that day, the son of the funeral home owner, jarren hood, was arrested. He works for carey royal ram ' n funeral home and told police that someone broke into his van and stole the box carrying the child while he was delivering him to the crematorium. In 2015, hood was found negligent for misconduct in the transportation of the baby and the funeral home was fined for breaking state law, according to cbs4 news partner the miami herald. Hood, however, was only charged with resisting arrest. At the civil trial, no one from the funeral home appeared."

        "summary": "Want human beings to feel a massive ego-boost? then look elsewhere, because a ground-breaking study published by science finds that insects ruled the earth about 400 million years ago and grew wings long before any other animal, reports heritage daily. They cropped up as plants began diversifying, in fact, and in short order created most of the major insect groups still flying today, notes wired. So which one came first? insects resembling today's silverfish existed roughly 480 million years ago, an expert tells tech times: \" then, about 400 million years ago, ancient ancestors of today's dragonflies and mayflies were the first to develop wings, \" he says. More on the study: lice came relatively recently, cropping up about 53 million years ago ( when modern mammals and birds came around ). So primates are actually older than those little guys. By the evolutionary clock, insects diversified quickly. Consider that plants colonized earth over the past 450 million years; well, insects needed just 80 million years to take over the skies and form most of their major groups. Led by a group in china, the study solicited genetic data from more than 100 insect specialists around the world and crunched it all with a supercomputer. This leapfrogged the fairly slow pace at which experts were analyzing insect subsets on their own. The study created the first-ever thorough evolutionary tree for insects, notes livescience.
