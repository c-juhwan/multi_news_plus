Per the ap, tyler butler was arrested on charges of arson and using an explosive device after cops say he tried to prevent the bank from selling his foreclosed home in a way that suggests he's watched too many looney tunes cartoons: blowing up the place with a bowling ball bomb, complete with what butler told deputies was a gunpowder-filled center and a rope for a fuse, the sun-sentinel reports. People in butler's neighborhood called 911 to report a house fire around 10pm sunday, and someone told police on the scene that butler was still inside. Deputies detained the man as he left the burning building, and as firefighters put out the blaze, they noticed a bowling ball with what looked like a wick sticking out. Witnesses said butler had mentioned before the fire that \" he wasn't gonna leave the house he [ used ] to live in, that he would burn it down, \" per a palm beach county sheriff's arrest report. ( a seattle man wasn't trying to burn down the house where he lived — he just wanted to kill a spider. )",

The latest on the subject, and tillerson in general: as for what lavrov may have needed to clarify, the ap notes that moscow's directive that the us cut 755 embassy and consulate staffers was confusing to some, as it's thought the us government doesn't employ that many people in the country. Usa today's take on the meeting highlights this quote from tillerson: \" i don't think it is useful to just cut everything off on one single issue [ of election meddling ]. These are two very large countries and we should find places that we can work together, let's try to work together. \" the us may be giving itself a few weeks to formulate a response, but the hill sees \" a sign of further steps russia is taking in response to the sanctions. \" it cites a brief reuters report that quotes russia's deputy foreign minister as telling russia media, \" we will of course intensify work related to... Reduction of dependence on us payment systems, on the dollar as a settling currency and so on.

Presenting their findings at the european society of human reproduction and embryology annual meeting in helsinki, finland, this month, researchers in greece said they were able to reverse menopause in roughly 30 women, including one who entered menopause at 40 but five years later menstruated again, reports new scientist. The team has collected three eggs from her and, using her husband's sperm, fertilized two into embryos that they plan to implant into her uterus. Still, an outside researcher says, the development \" opens up ethical questions over what the upper age limit of mothers should be. \" the team reports that roughly 1 % of women become infertile before they turn 40 thanks to certain medical conditions and cancer treatments. \" it offers a window of hope that menopausal women will be able to get pregnant using their own genetic material, \" says gynecologist konstantinos sfakianoudis. The team injected a woman's ovaries with a platelet-rich plasma — or prp, which is made with a person's own blood to trigger tissue and blood vessel growth and has been used by the likes of tiger woods to speed healing from soft-tssue injuries, notes forbes — to effectively rejuvenate them and trigger menstrual cycles. They're not yet sure exactly how it works, but they've managed to fertilize eggs from nearly all of the 30 women they studied, who are between 45 and 49 and want to have children.

But where did that figure come from and what's behind it? the number, the ceo said, comes from a 2010 princeton university study by economist angus deaton and nobel-prize winning psychologist daniel kahneman and published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. In the study, the researchers analyzed the answers to questions about income and well-being from more than 450,000 americans polled by gallup and healthways. Money does indeed buy happiness but only up to a point, the researchers found. The less someone made below $ 75,000, the unhappier they reported feeling. But making above that income threshold did not lead to increasing happiness. It's actually a bit more complicated than that, said study author kahneman, who is now retired. As he explained it, there are two types of happiness: day-to-day mood and long-term well-being. \"making a higher income doesn't appear to affect your daily happiness after a point but making more and more money does continue to improve your outlook on life indefinitely, \" he explained. In other words, an annual paycheck higher than $ 70,000 won't leave you feeling any less grumpy on"

She says she only realized the animal was a mountain lion after it picked up lenore, her 15-pound portuguese podengo, and stalked back out. Fought says she took a flashlight and searched for her dog outside, but found only \" wet, very clear, large paw prints walking in, \" along with drops of blood, the los angeles times reports. \" what's so rare and shocking about this is that the animal comes up to the property and enters the home, \" says san mateo county sheriff's office spokesman salvador zuno. He says detectives notified the california department of fish and wildlife after finding what appeared to be mountain lion footprints around the home. He says homeowners should keep their doors and windows locked and have an air horn handy. ( last year, a mountain lion apparently killed a koala at a los angeles zoo. )",

The international team of researchers come to one clear conclusion: environmental conditions made life hard for the rapa nui people before europeans ever arrived at easter island in 1722, livescience reports. According to the study, the rapa nui used two of three areas on the island far less in the late 1650s and very early 1700s, possibly because one site was susceptible to droughts and another suffered from poor soil fertility. Researchers pegged those years by analyzing water absorption in obsidian flakes from rapa nui tools scattered around the island. \" the results of our research were really quite surprising to me, \" says co-author thegn ladefoged. \" indeed, in the past, we've published articles about how there was little evidence for pre-european-contact societal collapse. \" that's the old hot point: whether europeans devastated the rapa nui with disease and slavery, or the locals had already ruined the land with over-use and possibly resorted to cannibalism, phys.org reports. Now other sources, like science news and the washington post, are saying, hey, environmental conditions worsened life for the rapa nui but didn't ruin their civilization — so europeans did that. And ladefoged doesn't disagree, saying that the rapa nui reacted \" to regional environmental variation... Before they were devastated \" by european disease and other changes.

        "summary": "After multiple failed pregnancies, maria lancaster miscarried again when she was 46. At age 47, however, she finally gave birth to a daughter, though her pregnancy did not come through in vitro fertilization, or egg or sperm donation. Rather, lancaster is a \" snowflake mom, \" ozy reports, having adopted an embryo in order to become pregnant and have a child. There were believed to be more than 600,000 frozen embryos being stored in the us in 2011, reports la weekly, which terms embryo adoption a \" sort of by-product of ivf \" — making use of embryos left over after women successfully undergo the procedure. A rep for the nearly 20-year-old snowflakes embryo adoption and donation program — the first embryo adoption agency to open its doors, per la weekly — says at least 1,000 snowflake babies have been born over the years. Where ivf can cost as much as $ 20,000 and still have less than a 4 % success rate with women over 44, per ozy, embryo adoption costs about $ 3,500 and gives a woman in her 40s a 50-50 shot of becoming pregnant. \" if you're doing embryo adoption, age doesn't really matter as long as you have a uterus, \" an ob-gyn tells ozy. Another doctor tells la weekly that her clinic at usc transfers adopted embryos into women up to 53 years old; the american society for reproductive medicine recommends age 55 be the cutoff. \" it is becoming more and more common, but there's a very small minority of people who want to donate their embryos, \" an attorney tells the chicago tribune. Ozy has more on the process — and how much the government has spent promoting it. ( these human embryos grew outside the womb for 13 days. )",

Again fleiderman got pregnant, but at around week five her ob-gyn told her she feared fleiderman had an ectopic pregnancy. A few days later, fleiderman was given medication to stop the growth of the abnormally progressing pregnancy, and she miscarried again. \" the emotional and financial strain of trying to get pregnant and having failed pregnancies, one after another, it's horrible, \" fleiderman says.

After the 2012-13 school year, the test will no longer be offered as part of the school's news writing course, roush said. Instead, students will sign up to take it at the school's student records office, where it is offered on a weekly basis. \"what we're trying to do is encourage students to take it earlier in their time here on campus so we don't have second-semester seniors taking it to graduate, \" he said. Nicole yang, a senior journalism major, has taken the current version of the test. She said she wished the test had included a word choice section when she took it but said she thinks the spelling section still has merit. \"i feel like as a journalist it's something you just need to",

Putin of russia reached out to president obama on friday to discuss ideas about how to peacefully resolve the international standoff over ukraine, a surprise move by moscow to pull back from the brink of an escalated confrontation that has put europe and much of the world on edge. After weeks of provocative moves punctuated by a menacing buildup of troops on ukraine's border, mr. Putin's unexpected telephone call to mr. Obama offered a hint of a possible settlement. The two leaders agreed to have their top diplomats meet to discuss concrete proposals for defusing the crisis that has generated the most serious clash between russia and the west since the end of the cold war. But it remained uncertain whether mr. Putin was seriously interested in a resolution that would go far enough to satisfy the united states, ukraine and europe, or instead was seeking a diplomatic advantage at a time when he has been isolated internationally. While the white house account of the call emphasized the possible diplomatic movement, the kremlin's version stressed mr. Putin's complaints about \"extremists \" in ukraine and introduced into the mix of issues on the table the fate of transnistria, another pro-russian breakaway province outside his borders.

The flag was flown around the world and signed by the likes of george pataki, rudy giuliani, and michael bloomberg, until it was discovered that it was not the real one. There was one dead giveaway: the autographed flag was 5 feet by 8 feet, while the one in the photograph was 3 feet by 5 feet. Then, in the fall of 2014, four days after the flag mystery was featured on the first episode of brad meltzer's lost history, a man who called himself brian carried a flag in a plastic bag into a fire station in everett, wash., and told the firefighters he was a former marine who'd been given the flag by a national oceanic and atmospheric administration employee, who'd been given it by a 9/11 widow. There are several holes in his story, and no one's been able to find him since he dropped it off, but the flag has been tested and confirmed to be the original. Original owner shirley b. Dreifus has donated it to the sept. 11 museum, where it is set to go on display. Meanwhile, wkbw reports that people are planting nearly 3,000 flags ( one for every victim ) in western new york.

The fda now says it will \" consider taking regulatory action, as appropriate, to protect consumers, \" but cohen tells cbs news the agency \" completely dropped the ball. \" all supplements containing bmpea were removed from stores in canada in december after health authorities described risks of raised blood pressure, \" serious cardiovascular complications, \" and other issues, the times reports. Why hasn't the fda identified similar risks? critics say it may be because some of the fda's top regulators of the supplement industry have come from the natural products association, which lobbies against laws that would impose tougher standards.

Last year, the off-duty border patrol agent shot a target filled with the explosive tannerite and colored powder — blue for boy, pink for girl — on a dry and windy day in green valley, ariz. The ensuing blast started a brush fire that quickly spiraled out of control into what became known as the sawmill fire, according to a release from the us attorney's office in arizona. It took about 800 firefighters close to a week to finally control it. \" i feel absolutely horrible about it, \" the 37-year-old dickey said in court last week. \" it was probably one of the worst days of my life. \" because it was an accident, dickey wasn't charged with arson, and he is expected to keep his border control job. Luckily, the fire caused no injuries. Dickey had to immediately dip into his retirement fund to hand over $ 100,000, and he will make monthly payments of $ 500 for 20 years, reports the sahuarita sun.

Forest service, the bureau of land management, and various private landholders. Dickey immediately reported the fire to law enforcement, cooperated, and admitted that he started the fire. The total losses attributable to the fire, including suppression costs and damage to land and landholdings, totaled more than $ 8 million. In his plea agreement, dickey agreed to a sentence of five years ' probation, and to make a public service announcement with the u.s. Forest service concerning the cause of the sawmill fire. Dickey agreed to pay restitution totaling $ 8,188,069. Dickey also agreed to make an initial payment of $ 100,000 toward the restitution judgment and monthly payments thereafter. The investigation in this case was conducted by the u.s. Forest service. The prosecution was handled by the u.s. Attorney's office for the district of arizona, tucson.

As tensions with iran rise, the us military has been quietly boosting its strength in the persian gulf, reports the los angeles times. The move comes as us officials have warned iran that closing the strait of hormuz, as it has threatened to do, would be a \" red line \" that would trigger an american response, reports the new york times. New deployments have raised troop numbers in kuwait to nearly 15,000 and there are now two aircraft carriers and their strike groups in the region. The army's 1st cavalry division's 1st brigade, which moved from iraq to kuwait, has been designated a \" mobile response force \" for the region. The buildup was requested late last year by central command chief james mattis, the top us commander in the region. Pentagon officials say the deployments are not a preparation for war, but an effort to have a force ready to react quickly if a military crisis erupts in the standoff with iran.",

Kierah lagrave was arrested thursday in plattsburgh, new york, on second-degree strangulation charges after the alleged victim reported the assault on oct. 20. Police say the 22-year-old admitted to choking the bouncer into unconsciousness at five1eight nightclub but did it because he had grabbed her, per the press republican. But surveillance video suggests that the real perpetrator was a friend of lagrave's. Lagrave, who also works at the club, can be seen on video talking to a female friend at the bar before turning to dance — which is when her friend playfully slapped lagrave's behind, per the new york post. The 125-pound lagrave then spotted the bouncer walking by and put him in a chokehold until he fell to the floor unconscious. Law and crime notes that lagrave's friend can be seen glancing at the assault and tossing her hair, then walking over when the bouncer was about to fall over. Released on her own recognizance, lagrave is slated to return to court nov. 20.",

Costco's numbers were revealed in an earnings call with cfo richard galanti last week, who noted that costco's sales of organic have doubled over the past couple of years.

So while costco's relatively new tack may seem surprising — as thestreet's jim cramer puts it, the news is \" quite a change from when management of costco admitted to me just a few years ago that they thought it was a fad that would go away \" — it's probably just the start, with retailers like walmart not far behind, per the times.

When two philippine air force planes landed at the city's airport earlier today, they were swarmed by a crowd of thousands of people — some holding babies over their heads — who surged past a fence in an attempt to escape. Only a few hundred made it on board. \" people are just scavenging in the streets, \" says a man who managed to get his wife and two children on a flight out but stayed to guard what remains of his home. \" the grocery stories have all been looted. They're empty. People are hungry. And they ( the authorities ) cannot control the people. \" by now the looting has died down, however, abs-cbn reports, in part thanks to a heavy police and military presence, and in part because, in the words of one government aid worker, \" there is nothing left to loot. \" but as people try to escape the city, which is still littered with corpses, others are flooding in, searching for lost relatives or hoping for aid, which largely has yet to arrive, the wall street journal reports. The government believes the death toll — now at 1,774 — will rise sharply. Tacloban's city administrator says that in the city alone it \" could go up to 10,000. \" thousands have been reported missing and hundreds are being buried in mass graves. President benigno aquino thinks the 10,000 figure is too high, however, predicting it ' ll settle between 2,000 and 2,500, according to cnn. The bbc has more harrowing numbers: 9.8 million people have now been affected, 2.5 million are short on food, and 659,268 have been displaced. While international aid is pouring in, there still doesn't seem to be an effective operation in place to help survivors in tacloban, according to a bbc reporter at the scene.

        "summary": "Ever wonder why your cat sleeps all day while you're stuck with the measly seven hours you can cram in between scandal and your morning commute? as it turns out, you're just way better at sleeping than your furry friend. According to a study in evolutionary anthropology, humans evolved to be the most efficient sleepers in the primate family. Researchers from duke university studied the sleep patterns of 21 primate species and hundreds of other mammals, according to a press release. They found humans sleep less than most primates — the sleepiest of which gets as much as 17 hours per night. But humans also sleep deeper than other animals, with 25 % of our shuteye coming as rem sleep; some primates get as little as 5 %. Researchers hypothesize that when our ancestors came down from the trees, a change in sleep patterns proved beneficial, medical news today reports. Less time spent sleeping on the ground meant less time to be eaten by a lion or attacked by a rival tribe and more time for social interactions and other benefits. \" less sleep would enable longer active periods in which to acquire and transmit new skills and knowledge, while deeper sleep may be critical for the consolidation of those skills, leading to enhanced cognitive abilities in early humans, \" the study states. So — as gizmodo puts it — the fact that we're \" burning the candle at both ends \" might explain \" why humans are playing with ipads while the rest of our close family is still throwing poop. \" ( in fact, another study shows ancient humans may have slept even less than we do now. )",

            "Insomniacs take heart: humans get by on significantly less sleep than our closest animal relatives. The secret, according to a new study, is that our sleep is more efficient. Researchers from duke university scoured the scientific literature and compiled a database of slumber patterns across hundreds of mammals including 21 species of primates -- from baboons and lemurs to orangutans, chimpanzees and people. They then used statistical techniques to account for each species ' position in the primate family tree. They found that humans are exceptionally short sleepers -- getting by on an average of seven hours of sleep a night, whereas other primate species, such as southern pig-tailed macaques and gray mouse lemurs, need as many as 14 to 17 hours. What's more, our sleep tends to be more efficient, meaning we spend a smaller proportion of time in light stages of sleep, and more of our sleep time in deeper stages of sleep. A dream state called rapid eye movement sleep, or rem, for example, makes up nearly 25 percent of our overall sleep. But in primates such as mouse lemurs, mongoose lemurs and african green monkeys, rem sleep barely climbs above five percent. \" humans are unique in having shorter, higher quality sleep, \" said anthropologist and study co-author david samson of duke, who logged nearly 2,000 hours watching",
            "Have you ever woken up after 8 hours of sleep and thought to yourself that you could sleep for a few more? perhaps something from your evolutionary past is calling to you.

For example, school-age children need about 10 hours of sleep each day, while teenagers need 9-10.

At this point, one thing is clear: you can't blame the original speechwriters.

It didn't include any of the controversial passages that would come to embarrass the campaign — in fact, the delivered speech bears almost no resemblance to the original. So who changed it? that's still not fully clear, but the new york times reports that melania trump herself was unhappy with the original and decided it needed to be overhauled. The times says she turned to \" trusted hand \" meredith mciver, who helped donald trump with books like think like a billionaire, and it seems their research led them to previous speeches by first ladies. The times adds that it's unclear how much of a role mciver had in writing the final speech, but when all was said and done, it reports only the introduction and a line about a \" national campaign like no other \" was left standing from the original. Nbc news, meanwhile, reports by way of sources that rick gates, a top aide to campaign chairman paul manafort, approved the final text.

The finding from a 10-year study of more than 7,000 british government workers contradicts previous notions that cognitive decline does not begin before 60 years of age, and it could have far-reaching implications for dementia research. Pinpointing the age at which memory, reasoning and comprehension skills start to deteriorate is important because drugs are most likely to work if given when people first start to experience mental impairment. A handful of novel medicines for alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, are currently in clinical trials, but expectations are low and some experts fear the new drugs are being tested in patients who may be too old to show a benefit. The research team led by archana singh-manoux from the center for research in epidemiology and population health in france and university college london found a modest decline in mental reasoning in men and women aged 45-49 years. \" we were expecting to see no decline, based on past research, \" singh-manoux said in a telephone interview.

If employers suddenly have to start ensuring that they've got wider seats, larger tables, more parking spaces for people who are obese, i think then we're just making the situation worse jane deville almond, british obesity society judges said that obesity in itself was not a disability - but if a person had a long-term impairment because of their obesity, then they would be protected by disability legislation"

        "summary": "Virginia state police are still attempting to piece together exactly what happened at state sen. Creigh deeds'residence yesterday, but have confirmed that they \" are looking at this as an attempted murder and suicide. \" the times-dispatch elaborates on its report on the mental health evaluation son gus deeds underwent on monday, reporting that the exam occurred at bath community hospital, and that the 24-year-old was indeed released due to the lack of an available bed — though the search for one covered a broad section of western virginia. The director of the board that oversees the state's mental-health services explains to the washington post, \" i can tell you right now, it was multiple hospitals that they called. That is a very rural area. The hospitals are few and far between. \" more updates: and then there's this, from the post: creigh deeds last week posted to his facebook page a new york times article about shortcomings in how our country cares for young people with mental-health issues. The post notes that, six years after the massacre at virginia tech, the state is still struggling to adequately fund its mental-health system. Police say the elder deeds, who was yesterday afternoon upgraded to fair condition, was stabbed near a barn on the property, reports the daily progress. He walked about 225 feet down a steep gravel driveway to the road after being attacked, where he was spotted by a cousin driving by; it's unclear if the cousin had been contacted. Gus lived at that home along with deeds'second wife, siobhan; the two married last year, and she was not home during the incident. The post notes that the couple had returned to virginia on friday from a week-long european vacation, per siobhan's facebook page. Deeds had four children from his first marriage; gus was his only son. Politico notes that a firearm was found at the scene, but police aren't yet saying who it belonged to or what type it is. Meanwhile, friends and classmates are stunned, and recall gus not as troubled, but as an \" exuberant and talented musician \" who worked hard to make people smile, reports the times-dispatch. But the music major had withdrawn from william &amp; mary about a month ago, and his academic adviser notes that he had left school on a prior occasion due to some kind of issue. Brian hulse says it was his understanding that deeds got some sort of religious support that gave him \" structure or whatever he needed to come back to school. \"",

The university began digging into the mystery, thus far without much luck. It explains that the envelope looks quite weathered, like it got a beating in the mail. Except the package doesn't have us postage on it, and the stamps it does feature look photocopied. The mostly handmade journal's destination, the building that houses admissions, used to be home to the geology and geography department, the tumblr notes. Lucasfilm confirmed the package isn't part of a viral marketing stunt. The ap reports one working theory: that it's part of an \" alternate reality \" game where players plant clues for others.",

            "Indiana jones mystery package we don't really even know how to start this post. Yesterday we received a package addressed to \"henry walton jones, jr. \".

When our student mail worker snapped out of his finals-tired haze and realized who dr. Jones was, we were sort of in luck: this package wasn't meant for a random professor in the stat department. It is addressed to \"indiana \" jones. What we know: the package contained an incredibly detailed replica of \"university of chicago professor \" abner ravenwood's journal from indiana jones and the raiders of the lost ark. It looks only sort of like this one, but almost exactly like this one, so much so that we thought it might have been the one that was for sale on ebay had we not seen some telling inconsistencies in cover color and \"ex libris \" page ( and distinct lack of sword ). The book itself is a bit dusty, and the cover is teal fabric with a red velvet spine, with weathered inserts and many postcards/pictures of marion ravenwood ( and some cool old replica money ) included. It's clear that it is mostly, but not completely handmade, as although the included paper is weathered all of the \"handwriting \" and calligraphy lacks the telltale pressure marks of actual handwriting. What we don't know: why this came to us. The package does not actually have real stamps on it – the outside of the package was crinkly and dirty as if it came through the mail, but the stamps themselves are pasted on and look like they have been photocopied. There is no us postage on the package, but we did receive it in a bin of mail, and it is addressed to the physical address of our building, rosenwald hall, which has a distinctly different address from any other buildings where it might be appropriate to send it ( haskell hall or the oriental institute museum ). However, although now home to the econ department and college admissions, rosenwald hall used to be the home to our departments of geology and geography.

Gregg spriggs, a weapons physicist at the lawrence livermore national laboratory, tells paleofuture the films were \" on the brink \" of being \" useless. \" not anymore. Spriggs has scanned 4,200 of the films to digital and gotten 750 of them declassified.

He isn't just preserving the nuclear test footage for historical purposes but to learn as much as possible from it scientifically, the verge reports. Atmospheric nuclear testing has been banned since 1963, and these old films represent some of the best data available for scientists in the present. Spriggs ' laboratory has found about 6,500 of the test films. He says it will take two years to digitize the rest of them and many more years after that to get them declassified.

The entry fees paid by some 25,000 visitors a year ( note of warning for guests, per the new york times: the two ancient toilets don't function ) help fund the repairs, but sir lachlan tells the paper he expects there won't be money to keep them going after 2017. This after sir lachlan in june 2012 informed the maclean clan congress that his family couldn't afford further repairs; a public appeal was launched at the time, only to be followed in the winter of 2013 with the collapse of four ceilings due to water penetration.

Voting to have the bell remain in use in the church tower in the village of 700, councilors said it would serve as a memorial against violence and injustice and as a symbol of reconciliation, reports the bbc. Former church organist sigrid peters doesn't see it that way, though the move follows recommendations by outside experts. Peters says she's saddened they would \" allow a bell dedicated to a murderer to hang in the church, \" especially following the huge election gains of the far-right alternative for germany party in september.

The atlantic notes we already knew that this occurred, but that the toll is just now being fully understood: it describes a new study published in the journal nature as \" a kind of autopsy report for the debacle. \" a team led by terry hughes, the head of the arc centre of excellence for coral reef studies, examined the \" catastrophic die-off \" more closely to establish links between high levels of heat exposure, the resulting coral bleaching, and how well the coral ultimately withstood it. The upshot isn't good: about a third of the world's largest reef system succumbed to the \" mass mortality \" between march and november that year, per the guardian. The los angeles times notes a second heat wave in 2017 exacerbated things, with both events leading to the destruction of about half the great barrier reef's coral. The researchers found that coral in areas where the heat exposure was greatest experienced the biggest die-offs. ( per the new york times, it only takes a spike of two or three degrees fahrenheit above normal to decimate the coral. ) another shocker: about half the coral destroyed in 2016 didn't gradually die from starvation, as scientists believed would happen, but instead went south \" very quickly \" from heat stress, taking only a few weeks to perish. Hughes says he's trying to keep a \" glass half full \" outlook, noting that the billion corals that did endure are more resilient than their unfortunate counterparts. Still, if we can't keep the heat under control, it's \" game over, \" he says. ( australia will feel a \" profound \" impact from this loss. )",

        "summary": "With days to go until 538 electors officially decide on the next us president, the \" faithless \" are hard at work to ensure that person is not donald trump. Activists need to convince 232 democratic electors plus 38 republican electors to vote for someone else. That person would presumably be a republican, not hillary clinton, as there are more republican national electors overall, but activists hope democrats feel anyone would be better than trump, reports kdvr. Is such a scenario at all likely? it would certainly be a break with tradition. Throughout us history, more than 99 % of electors have voted for the candidate who won their state, which is legally required in 29 states, reports the ap. However, \" no elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged. \" it wouldn't be unconstitutional as electors are only required to \" meet in their respective states and vote by ballot, \" writes columbia law professor david pozen at the new york times. Indeed, he argues electors have an \" obligation to preserve the country and the constitution \" and should stand against what might be perceived as a threat. At the washington post, ej dionne jr. Recommends electors think long and hard before making their decision. \" our tradition — for good reason — tells you that your job is to ratify the state-by-state outcome of the election, \" he writes. \" the question is whether trump, vladimir putin and, perhaps, clinton's popular-vote advantage give you sufficient reason to blow up the system. \" the ap lays out the pros and cons of doing away with the electoral college system altogether, stressing it was developed at a time when voters may not have had the opportunity to hear from a candidate out of state. Some 230 years later, that's no longer an issue. But that's a conversation for a later date, charles lane writes at the post. Trump and clinton knew they needed to win the electoral college to become president. Those now complaining about trump becoming president despite clinton leading him by 2.6 million votes nationwide might as well complain that the nfl on sunday \" awarded the tennessee titans a win over the denver broncos because they scored more points, even though the broncos got more total yards. \" electors vote on monday.",

Here's how and why the u.s. Does it like this: ___ origins the electoral college was devised at the constitutional convention in 1787. It was a compromise meant to strike a balance between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted no public input. Alexander hamilton wrote, \" if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent. \" at the time, the country had just 13 states, and the founders were worried about one state exercising outsized influence. Small states didn't want states with big populations to dominate. Southern states with slaves who couldn't vote worried that northern states would have a louder voice. There were concerns that people in one state wouldn't know much about candidates from other states. The logistics of a national election were daunting. The thinking was that if candidates had to win multiple states rather than just the popular vote, they would have to attract broader support. ___ how it works the electoral college is a process, not a place, the national archives likes to say.

Holmes county sheriff timothy zimmerly said the party was a rumspringa party, which is a right of passage for amish people in which teens between the age of 14 and 16 experience the non-amish world before deciding whether to be baptized within the amish church or leave the community. The 73 arrested were all booked and released. They all have future court dates. Download the cleveland 19 news app. Copyright 2016 woio. All rights reserved."

        "summary": "The concept of \" net neutrality \" is back in the news, with new fcc chief ajit pai laying out his plans to undo rules for internet service providers put in place in 2015, reports ars technica. The details are dense, but the general battle lines are drawn: advocates of the rules say they're necessary to prevent big isps from controlling what we see on the internet, while opponents such as pai see the rules as unnecessary regulations that strangle online enterprise. Here's a look at coverage: the ap has a primer on net neutrality, starting with the definition of it as \" the principle that internet providers treat all web traffic equally. \" for example, comcast wouldn't be allowed to block or slow down traffic to a service created by a rival. The fight revolves around the arcane reclassification of isps as \" title ii \" common carriers, essentially equating them with public utilities, explains variety. Read pai's argument here. He blames \" politics \" for the 2015 rule change and asks, \" do we want the government to control the internet? \" the consumerist is not happy with the fcc's move. Kate cox sums up the changes thusly: \" we'd lose the law that tells companies what they can't do and punishes them for breaking it, and instead replace it with a pinky swear from comcast, at&t, verizon, and everyone else that, sure, they ' ll play along — until they don't. \" the electronic frontier foundation frames it this way: most people have only one broadband service, and scrapping the rules gives isps \" unchecked power to extract tolls from you and from businesses that wish to reach you. \" yes, big content providers such as netflix and facebook can afford those tolls, but what about the next facebook or netflix? it's encouraging people to let their congressional representatives know they oppose rollback of the rules here. In the opposing camp is the wall street journal editorial page, which argues that pai's move \" would restore freedom and innovation that the federal government disrupted. \" among other things, it argues that isp promises not to block or slow content could be stipulated in service agreements. More than 800 startups and entrepreneurs signed a letter to pai saying that killing net neutrality might kill them, too. The fcc votes on the move may 18, but this is just the start of a long fight, and wired sees a decent chance that courts will keep net neutrality rules in place.",

She was never seen alive again. Officials say the body of the 33-year-old woman, who was shot in the back of the head, was found buried behind a shed yesterday morning on property owned by her stepfather, gregory r. Graf. He was yesterday charged with her murder. Graf reportedly confessed to shooting padgett in his home ( his home and business are located on the same land ) and disposing of her body, says northampton county district attorney john morganelli. Morganelli adds the apparent motive was sexual assault, the allentown morning call reports. Initially, the only clue in padgett's disappearance was her white subaru outback, found with her cellphone inside in a dollar general parking lot, the express-times reported. Investigators say graf left his truck near the parking lot the morning padgett vanished, telling an employee he had to have work done on it. Later, he allegedly dropped off padgett's car; surveillance video shows the truck being driven away about a minute later. \" we're still trying to develop that information as to whether this might be some evidence of premeditation, or whether he had good intentions to drop his truck off, \" says morganelli. Family friends tell nbc philadelphia that graf participated in the search for padgett, a newlywed who married in september.
