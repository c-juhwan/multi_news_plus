        "summary": "Republicans sometimes bristle at the comparisons between ronald reagan and barack obama because of their midterm troubles. A favorite conservative theme about reagan is that the \" love fest \" between him and the american people continued during and after his presidency, writes steve kornacki at salon, who singles out this piece as an example. He says it's time for a reality check. He ticks off the savings and loan mess, the iran-contra scandal, and a national debt that tripled to $ 3 trillion. George hw bush suffered for the sins of reagan, to the point where bill clinton was able to steal the \" reagan democrats \" back. Polls in 1992 found that just 24 % of americans thought the country was better off because of reagan, and his popularity sank below jimmy carter's to 46 %. His image has since been restored, but \" the conservatives who lionize reagan today are worshiping a flattering caricature, \" he writes.",

            "By 1992, three years after he left the white house, ronald reagan was anything but a beloved former president. As a painful recession gripped the country, the public came to see the reagan years -- which featured a massive defense buildup, soaring deficits and even a stock market crash in 1987 -- as the source of their economic woes. Running for president that year, bill clinton promised to enact a clean break from the \" failed policies of reagan and bush. \" as reagan prepared to speak at the republican national convention in august, a gallup poll found that just 46 percent of americans had a favorable view of him. By contrast, jimmy carter, the man reagan had defeated in a 44-state rout in 1980, was viewed favorably by 63 percent of the american public. The reagan presidency stood in something approaching disrepute. Today, though, you'd never know any of this happened. In the two decades since it bottomed out, reagan's image has been resurrected, thanks largely to a relentless campaign from conservative activists. Will bunch, who writes for the philadelphia daily news and is a senior fellow at media matters, chronicled reagan's image makeover -- and the reality of his record as president -- in his 2008 book \" tear down this myth. \" we spoke with him recently",

It is a fitting time to dispense once and for all with the myth that there is any similarity whatsoever between ronald reagan and barack obama. Washingtonians and insecure politicians obsess with comparisons but can anyone imagine lincoln or fdr or jfk or reagan comparing themselves to previous presidents? far too secure in their own skin, they enjoyed the presidency as kennedy said paraphrasing the ancient greeks that it was \" the full use of your powers along lines of excellence. \" advertisement advertisement fellini said, \" you must live spherically \" and by this, the old movie director meant one should live their lives in many different directions.

        "summary": "If all the movies you can watch at home for one low price per month isn't enough, a netflix co-founder has another proposal: a movie a day at actual movie theaters for one low price per month. That's the idea behind mitch lowe's startup company moviepass, which tuesday dropped that monthly subscription fee from up to $ 21 ( for just two movies a month ) to $ 9.95 for dozens — less than the cost of a single movie ticket in most cities, bloomberg reports. That subscription enables moviegoers to view one showing per day in any us theater that takes debit cards ( not counting 3d and imax films ), which lowe thinks should boost lagging ticket sales. In return, moviepass will pay the theater the full price of each ticket. To compensate for the money it may lose, moviepass is selling a majority stake to data firm helios and matheson analytics, with an ipo set for next year. But while moviegoers are getting ready to pour butter on their popcorn, variety reports that amc is threatening to sue moviepass for its cheaper plan, declaring in a statement that the subscription option is \" shaky and unsustainable, \" an uneducated attempt to \" turn lead into gold, \" and \" not in the best interest of moviegoers, movie theaters, and movie studios. \" although moviepass says its customers increase attendance more than 110 % and fork over more money for concessions, major exhibitors like amc prefer to invest in their own customer rewards program instead of hooking up with outside parties. Lowe shrugs at amc's waffling, comparing it to \" like blockbuster was when we rolled out netflix or redbox. It's the big guy being afraid of the little guy offering better value to consumers. \"",

Clark county sheriff joseph lombardo told reporters wednesday night that the gunman, who killed himself as police closed in, appears to have had an escape plan, though he didn't elaborate, the new york daily news reports. Lombardo also told reporters that he found it hard to believe that paddock didn't have some kind of help. \" maybe he's a super guy, \" he said, sarcastically, per the ap. \" you know, a super yay-hoo [ who ] was working out all this on his own. But it would be hard for me to believe that. \" in other developments: lombardo said paddock was a \" disturbed and dangerous \" man who apparently lived a \" secret life \" over the last decade, the las vegas sun reports. He said the secrecy was making it difficult to determine a motive for the shooting. Lombardo told reporters that paddock had been gambling just hours before he carried out the mass shooting, the bbc reports. He said that according to the latest casualty figures, paddock killed 58 people and injured at least 489. The chief of the fbi's las vegas division addressed reporters after lombardo and seemed to rebuke him for saying he was sure others were involved, the guardian reports. \" theories are great and everyone can have a theory, \" said aaron rouse. \" but i need to deal with facts. The sheriff needs to deal with facts. \" the new york times has done a fact check on rumors that more than one shooter was involved. Paddock was not among the highest rollers in las vegas, but he was well known in the city's casinos and was rewarded for his loyalty with perks like free hotel rooms, including the mandalay bay suite he carried out his shooting rampage from, the new york times reports. Police have also confirmed that the weekend before the mass shooting, paddock rented a room through airbnb at las vegas ' ogden hotel, which overlooked the life is beautiful alternative music festival. Paddock apparently targeted jet fuel tanks as well as the route 91 harvest music fest, sources tell the las vegas review-journal.

        "summary": "No one wants to be a doctor in new zealand for $ 267,000 a year, but getting paid $ 100,000 to sift through giant rats, dead animals, and even human body parts is right up noel molina and tony sankar's alley. Both men made six figures as nyc garbage collectors last year ( molina $ 112,000 as a driver, sankaer $ 100,000 as a helper ), complete with health insurance and a 401( k ), cnnmoney reports. And although not all trash workers rack up those kind of bucks, most enjoy a higher salary than not only many high school dropouts ( with median earnings in 2013 of about $ 24,000, per the department of ed ), but many high school grads ( $ 30,000 ) and even some college grads ( $ 48,500 for those with a bachelor's degree ). Per the department of labor, the median annual wage for \" refuse and recyclable materials collectors \" is $ 33,600, with those in the top 10 % pulling in $ 58,590. And if you're in a high-paying state, those wages are even more: in new york, for example, the annual mean wage is $ 52,570, or just over $ 25 per hour. To be sure, molina and sanka earn that paycheck: they work 55 to 60 hours a week from 7pm to 3am, do lots of heavy lifting in unsafe environments and all sorts of weather, and deal with stuff no one else would want to ( that human body part: a leg sankar spotted in a dumpster ). And some people feel there's still a stigma attached to handling trash. But it's a relatively easy field to get into: there's no high school diploma needed for many private companies, and firms will often train for the commercial license required to drive a truck. Plus industry wages have been consistently rising, qualified workers are in demand, and there's plenty of job security. \" we're one of the very few blue-collar jobs that can't be outsourced to china, \" the director of the solid waste association of north america says.

        "summary": "Russian officials are looking into a phenomenon that's been documented by a flurry of pictures on social media: one of the country's northernmost rivers turning a bloodlike bright red. Cnn reports that the daldykan river shifted to a rouge hue on tuesday, and while some are saying the cause could be iron ore in the ground, russia's environmental ministry says it's investigating the norilsk nickel factory located nearby, citing in a press release a possible \" break in a norilsk nickel slurry pipe \" that may have dumped a chemical into the water, the guardian notes. A mining expert explains to the verge that certain oxidation processes or those that use high heat — like ones that may be used in the nickel plant — can convert sulfide minerals into iron oxide, which can turn water red if they mix together. Residents in the area tell a local newspaper they've seen this happen before, though they're not elaborating. Norilsk nickel, which says it's the world's \" largest producer of nickel and palladium, \" is trying to deflect the finger-pointing, though it says it will tamp down production during the probe. Upper management there may also need to call the eye doctor. \" the color of the river today doesn't differ from its usual condition, \" the company told the ria novosti state news agency. The river doesn't hook up with the area's water supply, so locals shouldn't fret about immediate health hazards, norilsk city managers tell sputnik, via cnn, though the director of an environmental nonprofit says local farmers and herders could be at risk, especially if livestock drink the water or the water is used for irrigation. One resident who posted her images of the river on instagram frets, \" you get scared when you see this. And people are still gathering mushrooms and berries. \" ( the same thing happened in china two years ago. )",

In a report out yesterday, the agency revealed that canadian researchers have, as part of a pilot study, discovered such bacteria in a single raw squid found in a chinese grocery store in saskatoon, canada; it likely hailed from south korea. That's the first time it's been found in food, the washington post reports. Here's a really gloomy assessment from one of the researchers: \" this finding means a much broader segment of the population is potentially at risk for exposure. It's something you may be bringing into your home rather than something you would acquire while traveling or following hospitalization. \" the bacterium identified in the squid is a \" common environmental organism, \" explains the post, but in this instance, it had a gene that rendered it resistant to last-resort antibiotics called carbapenems. That organism, pseudomonas fluorescens, typically wouldn't harm a healthy person. But for someone with a weakened immune system, it could render common bacteria ( think e. Coli ) resistant to carbapenems. That's because, as the post explains, once the bacteria is in a person's body, it \" can share that gene or enzyme with other bacteria. And that makes those other bacteria also resistant. \" though properly cooking the squid would have killed the bacteria, it could spread during the food-prep phase.

They met as part of a group of about 50 prominent egyptians and opposition figures, including officials of the small, recognized opposition parties, as well as a handful of young people who helped start the protest movement. While both sides acknowledged the meeting as unprecedented, its significance quickly became another skirmish in the battle between the president and the protesters. Mr. Suleiman released a statement — widely reported on state television and instantly a focal point in washington — declaring that the meeting had produced a \"consensus \" about a path to reform, including the promise to form a committee to recommend constitutional changes by early march.

Secretary of state hillary rodham clinton said sunday the obama administration supports the transition to a new government now moving forward in egypt, but she says it must be up to the egyptian people to decide if the reforms go far enough. With mass protests now in their 13th day, clinton said the u.s. Is encouraging talks between opposition leaders and vice president omar suleiman aimed at ending the country's political crisis. But she withheld judgment on the decision by the muslim brotherhood to enter into discussions with the embattled government. The fundamentalist group said it would insist that president hosni mubarak, an authoritarian leader who's been in power for nearly three decades, step aside immediately. In an interview with national public radio, clinton said the u.s. Has been clear about what it expects as egypt moves toward a new government. \" the egyptian people are looking for an orderly transition that can lead to free and fair elections, \" she said. \" that's what the united states has consistently supported.

The south carolina republican revealed yesterday during a conversation about hillary clinton's emails that he had never sent an email before. \" i don't know what that makes me, \" he said on meet the press. Well, drawing on a pew research center report from 2012, five thirty-eight says that 9 % of american adults haven't sent an email either. And a pew report from last year says 15 % of american adults don't go online for email, surfing, pinging, posting, or whatever. What's really unusual about graham's email stance is the fact that he doesn't fit into the non-email group's demographic. Per the 2012 report, just 3 % of americans with a college education say they haven't clicked \" send \" before — while graham left the university of south carolina in 1977 with a bona fide degree. And his $ 174,000 salary makes him more affluent than most non-email users; 97 % of americans making at least $ 75,000 say they've used email compared to 85 % of people banking under $ 30,000. Whites are also more likely to have sent an electronic message. Only graham's age ( he's 59 ) makes him a closer demographic fit, but even then, 90 % of adults in his age range say they've sent email before. So why doesn't he? \" i've tried not to have a system where i can just say the first dumb thing that comes to my mind, \" he tells bloomberg.",

Researchers found that babies who didn't begin eating solids until the age of at least 10 months had four times the risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia ( all ) than that experienced by infants who started on solids by 4 months. Babies who started at 7 to 9 months saw triple the all risk of those who started at 4 months. But kids who got into solid food at 5 or 6 months didn't encounter an increased risk of the illness, which is the most common type of childhood cancer in the us, the researchers note. But the study had its limits — for instance, it only involved children from texas, and other factors could be involved in the risk level. Researchers aren't ready to say parents should abide by the findings, though they do approximately fit american academy of pediatrics recommendations that babies be exclusively breastfed until 6 months, at which point they should start eating solid foods; at that point, the cdc says, solid foods should \" complement \" breast milk. The aap suggests babies should continue breastfeeding until they're at least a year old. Indeed, the researchers note that breastfeeding for longer than six months is also associated with a reduced all risk. Overall risk of the disease, however, remains low, with about four us cases diagnosed per 100,000 kids each year, livescience reports.

Family, friends, and coworkers are mourning the loss of the nypd officer and bronx native who was fatally shot early wednesday only a few miles from her home. A longtime friend says familia grew up during the crack epidemic, and that made her want to help people. The new york daily news reports familia spent five years as a nurse at new york university hospital and another two years at the american red cross before joining the nypd 12 years ago. \"fully knowing the dangers that she faced, she suited up in uniform every day and stood tall against those who threaten and terrorize the good folks of the bronx, \" the head of the patrolmen's benevolent association says. Familia didn't just take care of the citizens of new york, she also raised three children while caring for her elderly mother. \"there is not one single negative thing that anyone can say about her, \" the president of the dominican officers association says. \"that's not because of her death — that's just her nature. \" familia was shot and killed while sitting in a police vehicle. It's unclear why she was shot, and she didn't know the shooter, who was killed by police a short time later. Jeff sessions says familia's death is the \" latest in a troubling series of attacks on police officers over the past two years, \" the washington post reports. The attorney general says the 48-year-old officer was \" unjustly targeted and murdered in a cowardly, unprovoked attack. \"",

A judge has ruled the 43-foot national war memorial cross violates the separation of church and state and needs to be removed within 90 days — once all appeals are exhausted, that is. But since the cross's supporters plan to petition the supreme court, it won't be going away too quickly, the san diego union-tribune reports. Justices already refused to hear the case once, sending it to the lower courts, but did leave open the option of a later review of the decades-long legal battle. The cross sits on federal land, after being transferred out of the city's ownership in 2005 to avoid the cross being removed under court order. Alternatives to taking it down, like putting up signs that the cross — erected in 1954 as a \" gleaming white symbol of christianity, \" kgtv reports — is not an endorsement of christianity, were bounced around before a ruling was made, but surprisingly, both sides seem happy with the result. \" i ' m somewhat upbeat about this, \" says a lawyer who fought for the cross to remain standing, noting the decision moves the case closer to a final decision from the supreme court. \" believe me, we've had darker days. \"",

( published thursday, sept. 17, 2015 ) the aide to gov. Cuomo who was hospitalized for more than a week after being shot in the head during festivities leading up to the west indian day parade in brooklyn has died, police said. Carey gabay, a first deputy general counsel at the empire state development corporation, succumbed to his injuries wednesday night at kings county hospital, according to the nypd. Gabay had been hospitalized for more than a week while in a coma, and his family said earlier wednesday he was brain dead. Gabay was caught in the crossfire between two gangs around 3: 40 a.m. Sept. 7 near the parade route in brooklyn as more than two dozen shots from up to three guns were fired, authorities have said. The nypd has released surveillance video of two men wanted for questioning in the case and authorities are offering a $ 12,500 reward for information leading to an arrest. Gabay, a 43-year-old harvard-educated lawyer and bronx native, joined cuomo's administration in 2011. The governor said in a statement wednesday night he learned of gabay's death \" with profound sadness. \" \"carey"

        "summary": "New research may have solved a \" deep-rooted mystery \" about our solar system and lent credence to the theory that there's a ninth planet chilling beyond pluto. ( sorry, buddy. ) researchers at caltech, including konstantin batygin and mike \" pluto killer \" brown ( who first floated the \" planet nine \" theory ), say evidence of the massive body has been right under our noses — or actually above our heads — all this time: the planet may cause the sun to appear tilted. How? well, the orbits of all other planets in our solar system are mostly flat, yet the zone in which they orbit the sun is tilted about six degrees off the sun's equator, per a press release. A massive hidden planet with an orbit set 30 degrees off the other planets ' orbits would explain why that is. Such a planet would give the solar system \" no choice but to slowly twist, \" study author elizabeth bailey says, and calculations apparently check out, per the guardian. There are other possibilities — that the planets were created this way or the sun's core influenced the orbits early on — but \" planet nine is the first thing that has been proposed to tilt the solar system that doesn't depend on early conditions, so if we find planet nine, we will be able to see if it's the only thing responsible, \" bailey tells space.com. Separate research from the university of arizona notes a massive planet would also explain odd orbits in the kuiper belt, the region beyond neptune's orbit. If there isn't a ninth planet, \" it has to be that there was one there yesterday and [ it ] disappeared, \" brown says. ( astronomers recently made a \" jackpot \" discovery. )",

In a televised address yesterday, gov. Alejandro garcia padilla called for debt restructuring and postponed payments, the ap reports. The same day, economists released a report offering a very bleak assessment of the island's economy. \" growth has not just been low, but output has actually been contracting for almost a decade now, which is remarkable for an economy suffering neither civil strife nor overt financial crisis, \" they wrote. Puerto ricans can't vote in presidential elections, but the crisis could still become a major issue in 2016 because there are millions of emigrants and people of puerto rican descent living in the us, and their political power is rising in florida, the times notes.",

One said goline texted that \" she would like to have sex with him but he was too young, \" and sent him a photo of her wearing a thong, according to court documents.

The tabloid was all set to run an interview with accuser beth ferrier when cosby's legal team got wind of it and threatened to sue. The tabloid reportedly provided cosby's lawyers with a copy of the unpublished story, and the two sides struck a deal. The enquirer killed the story and replaced it with a soft interview with cosby in which he rebutted the allegations that were just beginning to surface. Robin mizrahi, the reporter who interviewed ferrier, is no longer with the enquirer, but she tells the guardian that ferrier's story seemed air-tight. \"she passed the polygraph test with flying colors, \" mizrahi says. \"she had a very, very detailed description of what allegedly happened, which i still remember because it was so haunting. She said cosby had stood over her and then she fell asleep because there was something in her coffee. \" of course, it may not have made much of a difference had the enquirer printed the piece: ferrier soon gave an interview to the philadelphia daily news, but the story got nowhere near the national traction as the current one. At the daily beast, mark ebner writes that cosby's money and lawyers have \" vanquished \" several lawsuits over the years. ( casinos are the latest to cut ties with cosby. )",

        "summary": "Japan and russia have decided to have another stab at forging a peace treaty that will bring world war ii to an official end. Russian president vladimir putin met with japanese pm shinzo abe at the kremlin yesterday, and the first top-level summit between the countries in about a decade yielded an order for their foreign ministries to come up with a mutually acceptable plan, the christian science monitor reports. The biggest obstacle is the kurils, four pacific islands that russia seized soon after entering the war in august 1945 and are still claimed by japan. The issue tends to inflame nationalist sentiments in both countries, but analysts say that with japan getting a growing share of its energy from russia, and with both countries seeking to counter china's rise, the time could be ripe for a deal. In 1956, soviet leader nikita khrushchev offered to give the two southernmost islands back to japan, but the deal was never finalized. Putin recently said the issue could be settled with a \" hiki-wake \" — a judo expression for a tie — hinting that he might revive the khrushchev deal. And the wall street journal reports that the meeting seemed to be a \" particularly friendly \" one, per some of the officials who accompanied abe; they each got a photo with putin, which they described as unusual, and in a live press conference after the summit, putin reportedly whispered to abe that he likes japan. Another tidbit: the group lunched on caviar served from a bowl constructed of ice and opened a bottle of wine from 1855.",

            "Moscow -- at a working lunch here monday, russian president vladimir putin charmed the visiting japanese prime minister shinzo abe and his delegation by serving an 1855 vintage bottle of wine -- the year diplomatic relations between the two neighbors were first established with the treaty of shimoda. The guests were also served caviar on a bowl made of ice. Was it the beginning of a new thaw in sometimes-frosty japan-russian relations? or just old wine in an old -- but newly presented -- bottle? japanese officials played up what they considered a particularly friendly exchange. Each government official and business executive in mr. Abe's group got a personal handshake and photo with mr. Putin -- unusual for such events, officials said. Japanese and russian officials generally come to these meetings with differing agendas. The japanese want back the chain of islands off hokkaido seized by the soviet union at the end of world war ii. The russians want japanese money. The usual game is for the russians to suggest enough flexibility on the former to get more of the latter. During the summit, mr. Putin first talked a lot about economic issues. That made some japanese officials wary that russia may want to avoid discussing the islands. But their concerns were eased when mr. Putin then turned directly to the subject, saying there were other important things that needed to be",
            "Today's summit between shinzo abe and vladimir putin comes at an opportune moment but may founder on the old problem of the kuril islands, which japan still wants back.

A roundup: the new name is a \" special kind of bad, \" writes sean gallagher at ars technica. \" an oath is something you either take, \" like an oath of office, \" or a blasphemous interjection, \" he writes. \" in the case of oath the company, it may be more of an oath of acquiescence as verizon's mobile and broadband customers sign their contract. \" the 20 brands armstrong referred to include the huffington post, flickr, and tumblr. It's not clear what parts of the business the yahoo name might survive in, and a yahoo spokeswoman declined to comment on the new name to business insider. The deal could be complete as soon as april 24. Twitter users had a lot of fun with the name, describing it as better suited to a german heavy metal band or \" the name of a movie that stars nicole kidman as a troubled puritan widow in 1600s massachusetts, \" cnet reports. \" the last ' oath ' yahoo took was to keep my email safe and wellllll, \" tweeted silicon valley editor casey newton. Sources tell recode that marissa mayer will have no role at the combined company. The blog is offering a free t-shirt to the author of the funniest joke under the #mocktheoath hashtag. Oath, an apparent attempt to breathe new life into both firms, is being called one of the worst rebrandings in corporate history, reports the telegraph, though some critics say it is merely the worst since the tribune company became \" tronc. \"",

A spokesperson for the riverside county district attorney announced friday three more counts of child abuse against both louise and david turpin and a new felony assault charge against louise. A lawyer for the turpins says the couple has pleaded not guilty to the new counts. The charges were the result of continuing investigation into the turpins. According to the washington post, investigators say it will be a long process for the 13 turpin siblings — ages 2 to 29 years — to learn to trust authorities. But as that happens, the siblings could reveal details about their lives that may lead to further charges against their parents. Authorities say the turpin siblings were beaten, starved, chained to their beds, only allowed to shower once a year, and more. The turpins were arrested in january after a child escaped. Karen spiegel, mayor of corona, tells abc news the siblings are being kept in two separate hospitals but communicating through skype. She says \" their minds are just being opened \" and they're \" starting to make plans for their future \" for the first time. For some, it's their first experience owning shoes or being able to choose what they eat. Spiegel says some of the siblings \" didn't really know what a toothbrush was for. \" more than $ 570,000 has been donated to the siblings ' medical expenses and education. \" in cases like this there are long-term needs like behavioral health, housing, scholarships, educational support, tutors, and medical needs, \" a hospital spokesperson says.",

Razieh ebrahimi's father forced her to marry a neighbor at age 14, and she gave birth to a child at age 15. She said she suffered physical and emotional abuse until, at age 17, she killed her husband with his own gun as he slept. The law defining a juvenile is murky in iran, reports the guardian, but hrw says ebrahimi qualifies and thus shouldn't be executed. Besides, says the lawyer for another rights group, young girls forced to wed \"are actually being raped constantly under the name of marriage. \" they should be in school, not living a \"life full of violence with no legal support, \" she says. \"they eventually kill themselves or their husbands to end this vicious circle. \" no date is set for the execution, but if the hrw campaign fails, it's possible that the victim's family could save ebrahimi by asking for a last-minute pardon.

        "summary": "\" we are just shocked. \" that's the reaction of the oregon humane society to a wednesday ruling by the oregon court of appeals that will require a rogue river couple to have their six dogs ' vocal cords cut. The court case was one between neighbors of nearly 20 years, reports the oregonian: debra and dale krein said the barking from karen szewc and john updegraff's tibetan and pyrenean mastiffs began in 2002 — at 5am each day, and didn't stop. The suit was filed 10 years later, with the kreins alleging an auditory hell so bad their kids didn't want to come home from school. Szewc and updegraff reportedly did attempt to rectify the situation with methods including shock collars, to no avail. A jury ruled in the kreins ' favor in 2015; szewc and updegraff were ordered to pay the couple $ 238,000 and have their dogs undergo devocalization. The appeals court upheld that ruling. Szewc and updegraff had argued that the dogs were what kept their livestock — sheep, goats, and chickens on 3.4 acres — safe from predators. The washington post reports that as such, they argued the county's public nuisance code didn't apply as they were subject instead to farming ordinances. But the ap in 2015 reported on the original ruling, which found tibetan mastiffs aren't a breed designed to guard livestock. It also cited the 2006 decision of a local hearings officer ( related to a citation over the barking ) who found the farm use defense was unavailable to the couple due to the small size and profits of their farming endeavors. They have not decided whether to appeal the latest decision. The oregonian notes the surgery still allows dogs to make a very quiet bark or squeak; critics call it a \" cruel and unnecessary \" procedure.

The 58-year-old venezuelan president has been treated for cancer in cuba for the past month, most recently battling respiratory complications",
            "Image caption mr chavez is said to be stable despite a lung infection the venezuelan national assembly has approved a request by president hugo chavez to postpone his inauguration for a new term in office, which was scheduled for thursday. Mr chavez is in hospital in cuba after cancer surgery, and has suffered complications caused by a lung infection. Legislators voted to give mr chavez as much time as he needed to recover. He has not been seen in public since his last operation a month ago. The government insists that the inauguration is a mere formality for an incumbent leader and can take place at a so far unspecified later date. The opposition argues that mr chavez's current mandate expires on 10 january and is calling on the supreme court to rule on the issue. The court has scheduled a news conference at 14: 00 gmt on wednesday. Venezuelan constitution article 231: the president-elect shall take office on 10 january...

        "summary": "It's said to be \" exceedingly rare, \" but a study in the bmj case reports journal documents the case of a 34-year-old uk man who showed up at a leicester hospital complaining he was having a hard time swallowing, and that he felt a \" popping sensation \" in his neck. After some prodding, doctors discovered the man had suppressed a sneeze by pinching his nose and clamping his mouth shut. That ended up rupturing his throat from the force of the stifled sneeze, rendering him voiceless and landing him in the hospital. Anthony aymat, a london doctor not involved in the study, explains to the ap that sneezes can escape your body at 150mph or so, and that if you try to keep one inside, \" it could do a lot of damage and you could end up like the michelin man with air trapped in your body. \" although they say a throat rupture like this is rare, the study's researchers elaborate on other potential complications, including a brain aneurysm or eardrum damage, per the guardian. The university of texas'dr. Zi yang jiang, who says he sees a couple of sneeze-induced issues each year, tells the ap a collapsed lung is also possible. Doctors used scans to assess this patient and found the popping sound was caused by air bubbles that had formed in his throat tissue and neck. \" the whole point of sneezing is to get something out of your body, like viruses and bacteria... If you stop that, those may end up in the wrong part of the body, \" jiang says. The patient was given antibiotics, fed through a tube, and released a week later, with strict instructions to let future sneezes fly. \" the safest thing to do — although it's not socially acceptable — is just to sneeze loud, \" aymat tells the ap. ( allowing yourself a hearty sneeze could also dislodge the toys stuffed up your nose for decades. )",

Even complainers fared better than humblebraggers in the study because they were viewed as more \" sincere. \" the researchers conducted five separate experiments to test how people perceived humblebragging. In one of the experiments, 300 or so people were asked to rate hypothetical people who made the following three statements: \" i am so bored \" ( complaint ), \" people mistake me for a model \" ( explicit brag ), and the everyone-wishes-they-had this-problem remark of \" i am so bored of people mistaking me for a model \" ( humblebrag ). Not only did the participants rate the complainers as the most authentic ( braggers came in second ), but they also imagined the humblebraggers to be less attractive than the braggarts. \" despite people's belief that combining bragging and complaining confers the benefits of both self-promotion strategies, humblebragging fails to pay off, \" the researchers conclude.

We first document the ubiquity of humblebragging across several domains, from everyday life to social media. We then show that both forms of humblebragging — complaint-based or humility-based — are less effective than straightforward bragging, as they reduce liking, perceived competence, and compliance with requests. Despite being more common, complaint-based humblebrags are less effective than humility-based humblebrags and are even less effective than simply complaining. We show that people choose to deploy humblebrags particularly when motivated both to elicit sympathy and impress others. Despite the belief that combining bragging with complaining or humility confers the benefits of each strategy, we find that humblebragging confers the benefits of neither, instead backfiring because it is seen as insincere.

We first document the ubiquity of humblebragging across several domains, from everyday life to social media. We then show that both forms of humblebragging — complaint-based or humility-based — are less effective than straightforward bragging, as they reduce liking, perceived competence, and compliance with requests. Despite being more common, complaint-based humblebrags are less effective than humility-based humblebrags and are even less effective than simply complaining. We show that people choose to deploy humblebrags particularly when motivated both to elicit sympathy and impress others. Despite the belief that combining bragging with complaining or humility confers the benefits of each strategy, we find that humblebragging confers the benefits of neither, instead backfiring because it is seen as insincere.

In testimony yesterday and this morning, new orleans police officer greg mcrae explained his decision to burn the body of 31-year-old henry glover, who had been shot by police officer david warren earlier that day. \" i had seen enough bodies, \" mcrae said. \" i had seen enough rot. \" mcrae testified that he did not know, at the time, that glover had been shot by a police officer. He said he was motivated by exhaustion, the trauma of the storm, and the need to get the body away from the makeshift police station where he was based. Glover's death was first detailed by propublica nearly two years ago, in an investigative partnership with the nation institute and the nation magazine. In june, the justice department indicted five officers in connection with the case. Warren has been charged with shooting glover; mcrae and lt.

Warren said that glover was running toward him at the time, and that from the second floor balcony where warren stood, it appeared that glover was holding a weapon. His partner that day, nopd officer linda howard, testified earlier in the trial that glover was actually running away from the strip mall where they stood -- not towards it -- when glover was shot. In testimony on monday, alan baxter, an expert for the defense, testified that warren's shooting was justified, and that warren met the standard for firing his weapon, which requires the reasonable belief that his or someone else's life was in danger.

        "summary": "Just as the tobacco industry aimed to quash evidence of health risks linked to smoking, a new paper claims the sugar research foundation decades ago suppressed research on the sugar's negative effects. The assertion comes via university of california at san francisco researchers who reviewed internal sugar industry documents, per a release. Npr explains what they say they found: in 1968, the srf funded a researcher's study that looked at the impact a high-sugar ( versus starch ) diet had on lab rats. The initial findings pointed to an increase in their triglyceride ( that's a fat in your blood ) levels and noted elevated levels of an enzyme linked to bladder cancer in their urine. The researcher shared initial findings, and srf opted not to fund the previously authorized three-month extension needed to finish the research. \" had this information been made public, there would have been a lot more research scrutiny of sugar, \" says paper author cristin kearns. She suspects more potential manipulation as \" isrf sponsored more than 300 research projects between 1943 and 1972, and its successor organizations continue to fund research, \" she tells the guardian. But one successor, the sugar association, argues the research published in plos biology is only a \" collection of speculations and assumptions. \" it says the 1968 study was ended because it was delayed, over budget, and occurred during \" organizational restructuring \" in which the srf became the international sugar research foundation. \" there were plans to continue the study with funding from the british nutrition foundation, but, for reasons unbeknown to us, this did not occur. \"",

        "summary": "\" he is conscious, and he is safe. \" with those words, an indian navy rep revealed the status of sailor abhilash tomy, who'd placed an emergency call from his yacht during a bid to make it around the world in the golden globe race. Per npr, tomy's vessel became dismasted friday during a storm in the indian ocean; with his satellite phone broken, tomy sent a message from a texting unit noting his back was seriously hurt and that he was initially immobilized. \" lugged cans of ice tea. Having that. Vomiting continuously. Chest burning, \" was a subsequent message the 39-year-old indian navy commander sent sunday, per the bbc. Race organizers soon became concerned after tomy stopped replying to their messages, cnn notes. Rescuers from different nations rushed to get to him, with a french fishing vessel finding him first, drifting about 2,000 miles off the coast of western australia. The golden globe, which kicked off in france on july 1, is a 30,000-mile circumnavigation, with competitors eschewing all modern tech ( e.g., gps ), save for satellite communications. Of the 18 sailors who started the race, just 11 are still in it, per the bbc ( npr says 10 ). Tomy's 36-foot yacht, the thuriya, is a reproduction of the suhaili, which won the first golden globe 50 years ago with sir robin knox-johnston at the helm. Knox-johnston tweeted his own worries for tomy on sunday, writing: \" very concerned about @abhilashtomy's injuries and will be glad when assistance can reach him. \" in a statement, race organizers praised tomy's decision to drop out of the race as a \" responsible \" one, noting his engine and self-steering gear had been rendered useless when the yacht capsized and that \" the alternative would have been to continue sailing singlehanded \" and risk getting caught in another storm.",

Some troubling incidents from his past: in 2007, when he was just 17 and a freshman at the university of florida, hernandez was allegedly involved in a bar fight. A bouncer claimed hernandez was being escorted out after refusing to pay his bill, and punched the worker in the head, leaving him with a burst eardrum. Then-teammate and close friend tim tebow tried to calm hernandez down and pay the bill before things got violent, the orlando sentinel reports. It's not clear how the case was resolved. The same year, hernandez, two other florida football players, and an nfl player were questioned in connection with a double shooting after florida lost a game. They were reportedly cooperative, and no charges were filed. Last year, police were called to a domestic disturbance involving fighting between hernandez and his fiancée, shayanna jenkins, tmz reports. Jenkins didn't want to press charges. An acquaintance filed a civil lawsuit against hernandez days before he was arrested, claiming hernandez shot him in the face after they argued at a florida strip club in february. They had flown to the area together, but when the man was initially found shot in the eye, he said he didn't know who had done it. Hernandez has also been linked to a bar fight in rhode island in may involving a gun; that incident may also have involved the same man who was with hernandez on the night of lloyd's murder. And of course, there's the double murder hernandez may have been linked to. Time points out that nfl arrests are on the rise, with 31 players arrested since the super bowl. A labor economist finds the increased arrest rates \" surprisingly high, \" considering players have such a huge incentive to stay out of trouble and earn millions on the field and through endorsements.

It's the latest sign that trump's campaign fury hasn't faded. Trump retweeted the brief video on his official twitter account sunday.

A white house official said at the time that the tweet had been posted inadvertently, and the image was deleted. In july, mr. Trump posted a video of him body slamming a man with a cnn logo superimposed over his head. The post with the golfing gif on sunday was just one of several eclectic tweets that mr. Trump sent, hours before his trip to new york, where he will address global leaders. In one, he referred to a conversation with president moon jae-in of south korea. \"asked him how rocket man is doing, \" mr. Trump wrote.

        "summary": "How did the company that built the bulk of healthcare.gov manage to bungle it so badly? there may be some clues in the corporate ethos of cgi federal, newsweek finds in an extensive look at the canadian it pioneer that now holds hundreds of government contracts in the us and abroad. At cgi, founder serge godin's unusual management philosophy still holds sway, with little in-house training for employees who are expected to \" manage themselves \" and \" make their own jobs \" by tracking down projects within the company, former execs say. The company doesn't even track sick days — but employees who go three weeks without finding a project can be fired. Most of its workers are classed as consultants and benefit from profit-sharing schemes. But beyond the corporate ethos — which extends to the firm having its own \" constitution \" — there are allegations of shady accounting practices, underhanded methods of winning projects, and a general sense that contractors have become so deeply embedded in federal agencies that \" they think they're part of the government, \" in the words of a senior technology exec. The long-term consequences of the healthcare.gov mess for the company are still unclear, but another contractor involved has already been replaced, reports the wall street journal. Hewlett-packard has signed a contract to serve as the project's web-hosting provider, replacing verizon subsidiary terremark. The switch, which means technical work will continue for months, was arranged before obamacare's botched launch, but sources say big problems with terremark's hosting were apparent years ago.",

But this secretive unit of the japanese army during world war ii — better known as unit 731 — conducted germ warfare and other lethal experiments on live prisoners of war, explains the guardian. Now, at the request of scholars, japan has for the first time released the names of 3,607 of those in the unit, a list that includes 52 surgeons, 49 engineers, 38 nurses, and 1,117 combat medics. The unit, developed in 1936 with the intent of developing biological weapons, conducted its experiments mostly in china on chinese and korean prisoners accused of espionage, reports the japan times. Its existence remained a secret for decades after the war, in part because the us and its allies did not want the work made public. Among other things, doctors would inject the plague into victims, deliberately cause frostbite, and deprive prisoners of food and water to observe the effects, per the afp. Surgeons also would perform operations on live prisoners as if they were lab rats. \" the list is important evidence that supports testimony by those involved, \" says katsuo nishiyama, a professor at shiga university of medical science. He said he hopes its publication will lead to more information about the unit, which conducted experiments with 20 different kinds of bacteria, including anthrax and smallpox. By one estimate, 3,000 people died at the hands of the unit. One tangible result: nishiyama will be pushing to have a university degree revoked from at least one medical officer whose dissertation is believed to have been based on the human experiments.

Firefighters in wolverhampton, england, say they were \" seriously unimpressed \" after five of them had to spend an hour dealing with a case of the latter thursday, the bbc reports. The west midlands fire service says a 22-year-old man it describes as a \" youtube prankster \" and his friends poured several bags of a fast-hardening product into an unplugged microwave oven they were using as a mold around the man's head, which was protected by a plastic bag. Firefighters say that by the time they were called, the man's friends had been trying to free him for 90 minutes and had given him an air tube to help him breathe. Firefighters had to call a technical rescue team for help freeing the man, which involved taking apart the microwave and very carefully removing the cement, using a screwdriver. \" as funny as this sounds, this young man could quite easily have suffocated or have been seriously injured, \" says watch commander shaun dakin, per the telegraph. \" all of the group involved were very apologetic, but this was clearly a call-out which might have prevented us from helping someone else in genuine, accidental need. \"",

        "summary": "The white house says president trump fired the fbi's james comey over his handling of hillary clinton's email trouble. Critics, however, think it's fishy that trump just happened to get rid of the man leading the investigation into russian meddling in the election. Now, a new report from the new york times won't help trump's case with those critics: it says comey asked the justice department for \" a significant increase in resources \" to expand the russia investigation just before he got fired. Here's a look: the meeting: comey went to deputy attorney general rod rosenstein last week with the request. ( remember that attorney general jeff sessions has recused himself from the russia inquiry. ) days later, rosenstein wrote the justice department memo being used to justify comey's firing, though that memo focuses on the clinton emails and doesn't mention russia, notes the ap. Denial: a justice department spokesperson tells huffpost that comey did not ask rosenstein for more money, but she did not elaborate on whether he asked for other resources, such as manpower. The optics: \" the timing of mr. Comey's request is not clear-cut evidence that his firing was related to the russia investigation, \" says the times in its assessment. \" but it is certain to fuel bipartisan criticism that president trump appeared to be meddling in an investigation that had the potential to damage his presidency. \" the briefing: comey briefed members of the senate intelligence committee on his request monday, the day before he was fired, reports the washington post, which adds that the status of the fbi investigation is now unclear. The optics, take ii: that comey got the boot over russia is all speculation, observes joe cunningham at the conservative redstate. \" however, with a media that is not friendly to the trump administration, and with the number of leaks this administration has produced, the best case scenario is that trump's timing was bad. \" another sign: cnn reports on what it sees as another \" significant escalation \" of the russia investigation before comey's firing: federal prosecutors issued subpoenas to associates of ousted national security adviser michael flynn, who is accused among other things of failing to report business dealings in russia.

            "– democratic party leaders united wednesday in calling for sen. Al franken to resign from the u.s. Senate, an extraordinary rebuke to the minnesota democrat as he faced a new allegation of sexual harassment. Franken planned to make an announcement about his future thursday morning on the senate floor. His office said it would happen at 10: 45 a.m. Central time, describing it as the senator planning to \" deliver a speech from the senate floor. \" a top democratic official told the star tribune that franken planned to resign, but the senator's staff insisted no final decision had been made. It was clear that franken's political career was hanging by a thread, as a wave of democrats throughout the day — first female senators, followed by many male colleagues and then other party leaders, said it was time for him to step down from the seat he's held since 2009. \"i believe it would be better for our country if he sent a clear message that any kind of mistreatment of women in our society isn't acceptable by stepping aside to let someone else serve, \" new york sen. Kirsten gillibrand, the first of franken's democratic colleagues to come out against him, posted on facebook. Politico reported that a former democratic aide says sen. Al franken tried to forcibly kiss her in 2006. If franken resigns, dfl gov. Mark dayton will appoint a temporary replacement. A high-ranking democratic source told the star tribune that the likeliest replacement is lt. Gov. Tina smith, a close dayton ally who would not be expected to run for the seat in an ensuing special election in november 2018. Dayton is expected to move quickly if franken resigns. Franken's day started when another woman stepped forward with allegations of unwanted touching. More than half a dozen women have shared stories of being groped, harassed or forcibly kissed by the minnesota ­democrat and former \"saturday night live \" performer, both before and after his senate election. Franken has repeatedly apologized, while saying the issue should be turned over to a senate ethics committee investigation. But the bruising round of denunciations, including from his closest colleagues and ideological allies, arriving in bursts throughout the afternoon, made that an increasingly untenable prospect.

            "– democratic party leaders united wednesday in calling for sen. Al franken to resign from the u.s. Senate, an extraordinary rebuke to the minnesota democrat as he faced a new allegation of sexual harassment. Franken planned to make an announcement about his future thursday morning on the senate floor. His office said it would happen at 10: 45 a.m. Central time, describing it as the senator planning to \" deliver a speech from the senate floor. \" a top democratic official told the star tribune that franken planned to resign, but the senator's staff insisted no final decision had been made. It was clear that franken's political career was hanging by a thread, as a wave of democrats throughout the day — first female senators, followed by many male colleagues and then other party leaders, said it was time for him to step down from the seat he's held since 2009. \"i believe it would be better for our country if he sent a clear message that any kind of mistreatment of women in our society isn't acceptable by stepping aside to let someone else serve, \" new york sen. Kirsten gillibrand, the first of franken's democratic colleagues to come out against him, posted on facebook. Politico reported that a former democratic aide says sen. Al franken tried to forcibly kiss her in 2006. If franken resigns, dfl gov. Mark dayton will appoint a temporary replacement. A high-ranking democratic source told the star tribune that the likeliest replacement is lt. Gov. Tina smith, a close dayton ally who would not be expected to run for the seat in an ensuing special election in november 2018. Dayton is expected to move quickly if franken resigns. Franken's day started when another woman stepped forward with allegations of unwanted touching. More than half a dozen women have shared stories of being groped, harassed or forcibly kissed by the minnesota ­democrat and former \"saturday night live \" performer, both before and after his senate election. Franken has repeatedly apologized, while saying the issue should be turned over to a senate ethics committee investigation. But the bruising round of denunciations, including from his closest colleagues and ideological allies, arriving in bursts throughout the afternoon, made that an increasingly untenable prospect. More than half of franken's fellow democrats in the u.s. Senate said he should step down, including senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york. Democratic national committee chairman tom perez also joined in.",

Police say a german and brazilian, both in their 20s, met a man in a rural area of south australia who drove them to a remote beach campsite in coorong national park on tuesday, per 7 news and the guardian. There, police say the man sexually assaulted the women, then tried to kill them. One was hit in the head with a hammer while the other was reportedly run over by a car. Incredibly, both managed to escape and run in different directions, reports the bbc. One was recaptured, but the other found a group of fishermen. \" she ran straight to the car yelling. She opened the back door, jumped straight in and [ was ] like, ' get me out of here, get me out of here.

A 59-year-old south australian man — 7 news reports he is of german heritage — was arrested later tuesday in coorong national park and faces charges of kidnapping, unlawful sexual intercourse, and attempted murder. The man cannot be named for legal reasons, but neighbors say police have raided his home several times over the last year, taking items including computers. A photo on facebook shows him holding a gun, while a fishing knife and hook were found at the campsite. \" he's never put hands on family. At least not on me or the kids, \" his ex-wife says. He's due in court in april. Both victims were admitted to a hospital, where the german backpacker remained in stable condition on thursday. ( a swedish doctor allegedly held a woman in a bunker. )",

Obama and romney were virtually tied there, according to a poll out yesterday; if either manages to grab the state's 13 electoral votes by a comfortable margin, that could be telling, reports the ap. 7: 30pm: the star of this time slot is ohio ( 18 electoral votes ), though it shares the spotlight with fellow swing-state north carolina ( 15 ). Real clear politics ' average of a slew of polls gives obama a three-point edge in ohio. 8pm: polling ends in the district of columbia and 16 states, with florida ( 29 ) and new hampshire ( four ) leading the list of ones to watch; a cnn poll of polls yesterday had obama up 50 % to 48 % in the granite state. The majority of florida's polls actually close at 7pm, but the ap cautions florida-watchers from declaring victory or defeat too quickly: some of the state's democratic strongholds are typically last to report. Also keep an eye on pennsylvania ( 21 ), which romney is hoping to grab from obama. 8: 30pm: the lone state of arkansas ( six ) closes its polls; romney should take it easily. 9pm: another 14 states call it quits. Keep an eye on colorado ( nine ), along with three states that are expected to go blue: wisconsin ( 10 ), minnesota ( 10 ), and michigan ( 17 ). If romney is able to flip any of them, it's big news. 10pm: among this hour's four states are the last of the battlegrounds: iowa ( six ) and nevada ( six ). If romney doesn't take ohio and wisconsin, he needs nevada. 11pm: polls close in five western states, and there shouldn't be any surprises.

The conviction closes one of new jersey's \" most notorious cold cases, \" the new york times reports. Lodzinski told police that her son, timothy \" timmy \" wiltsey, disappeared from a carnival in sayreville, n.j., on may 25, 1991, saying she turned away from him for a few minutes to get a soda and when she turned back around, he was gone. A search ensued, including a helicopter and a scuba team. Timmy's disappearance was featured on america's most wanted, and his photo appeared on milk cartons. In april of 1992, police identified human remains found in a creek at an industrial park as timmy's. Investigators had for some time suspected that lodzinski, now 48, was involved with timmy's disappearance, nj.com reports. Ultimately, it was child's blanket found near timmy's remains that cracked the case some two decades later. During the eight-week trial, three witnesses recalled seeing the blanket at lodzinski's home. \" she dumped his body in a creek like a piece of trash, but she left behind a telling clue: this blanket, \" the prosecutor said. \" no other killer could get this. \" before her 2014 arrest, lodzinski was living in florida with her two teenage sons. When the guilty verdict was read wednesday, per nj.com, there was a gasp in the courtroom and lodzinski began to shake. She faces life in prison. \" i hate to say i ' m very happy about it, but i am happy, \" a former teacher from timmy's school says. \" it took 25 years, and we knew back then that she was guilty. \" lodzinski plans to appeal.",
