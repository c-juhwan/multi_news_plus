The new york times shares accounts of female lawyers being called \" honey \" or \" darling \" in court, black lawyers being called racial slurs, demeaning physical contact ( \" i got the pat on the head, \" says one woman ), and more. Victims of this kind of behavior say it's done by opposing lawyers to get in their heads and gain an advantage in court. But that could change monday when the american bar association is scheduled to vote on an amendment proposed by the national association of women lawyers that would ban discrimination or harassment \" on the basis of race, sex, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, or socioeconomic status. \" \"changing the comment to a black-letter rule makes an important statement to our profession and the public that the profession does not tolerate prejudice, bias, discrimination and harassment, \" reads a report submitted to the house by the standing committee on ethics and professional responsibility, per the aba. Similar rules are already in place in 23 states, but this amendment would create national guidelines for the legal profession. Critics of the amendment say it would hamstring lawyers in court.

        "summary": "\" there's people on a jet ski … right in front of the boat, and now we're going to hit the jet ski. \" that's an observer's play-by-play in a youtube video now making the rounds after a very close call in florida waters over the weekend. The orlando sentinel reports the carnival magic was chugging along saturday afternoon when capt. Doug brown saw a jet ski with two passengers in his vessel's path. He rushed to call sheriff's deputy taner primmer, who was manning the marine unit's patrol boat that day and who quickly made his way to the scene. As primmer approached, one of the jet skiers fell off the recreational watercraft and tried to get back on, at which point the jet ski overturned and both jet skiers ended up in the water, with the carnival magic fast approaching. \" oh my god. No. Get in — get in! \" the video's narrator yells from the deck of the magic, as other spectators can also be heard screaming. Brown tells florida today his task of steering clear of the jet skiers, identified as 19-year old skylar penpasuglia and 20-year-old allison garrett, was made more difficult because of the wind forcing the west virginia women right in front of the ship, as well as a dredge close by that he needed to avoid. \" i was limited in how far i could maneuver, \" he says. But brown somehow managed to avoid disaster as primmer yanked both women into the sheriff's boat. Both brown and primmer were lauded for their quick thinking and professional efforts, with brevard county sheriff wayne ivey noting the jet skiers came perilously close to being dragged under the ship. ( a german man didn't bother to mention his wife had disappeared from a cruise ship. )",

The figure was revealed by a senior member of the group today. Exact facts surrounding the births of the duke and duchess of cambridge's children - on july 22, 2013 and may 2, 2015 respectively - were clouded in mystery for security reasons. It's now emerged the team on hand was much bigger than expected. Only a handful of midwives and others led by a consultant obstetrician were in the delivery room to supervise the birth of prince george and princess charlotte but waiting in the wings were more than a dozen experts in case of emergencies. ( image: duchess of cambridge/pa wire ) read more: kate gave birth to both children at the exclusive lindo wing of st mary's hospital in paddington, west london. It is the same place where princess diana gave birth to william in 1982 and harry in 1984. ( image: stuart c. Wilson/getty images ) read more: her luxurious private delivery suite - which cost an average of £ 4,965 a night - was complete with an en suite, wireless internet, satellite tv and champagne on request. There was also a chair for william to recline in while he waiting patiently for news. Extra supplies of kate's blood type were reportedly ordered in case of an emergency. Obstetrician marcus setchell, who was formerly the queen's gynaecologist, delivered the baby. He was overseen by gynaecologist alan farthing, the former fiancé of murdered tv presenter jill dando. ( image: pa ) in addition to the number of people involved quoted, contingency plans are known to have been put in place for kate to give birth near her parents ' home at the royal berkshire hospital. Staff were also prepped",
            "A doctor who helped deliver prince george and princess charlotte has revealed that 23 hand-picked hospital staff were on the team dedicated to the duchess of cambridge each time she gave birth. Professor tiong ghee teoh, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at st mary's hospital, paddington, and dr johanna bray, a consultant anaesthetist, met the duchess after being invited by the queen to a garden party at buckingham palace. The duke, who wore a top hat and tails as he attended his first ever palace garden party, and the duchess, attending her fourth, had plenty to chat about with the two doctors, who were on standby to take over if there had been any complications."

South africa's meerkat has already exceeded expectations. Though operating at a quarter of its eventual capacity with 16 of 64 planned dishes, meerkat's first image, released saturday, revealed some 1,300 unknown galaxies in a tiny patch of sky previously known to house only 70, reports afp.

The images feature a galaxy forming new stars from hydrogen gas and a black hole emitting electrons close to the speed of light, reports cnn. Naledi pandor, south africa's science minister, tells iol that the quality of images is what scientists expected from 32 dishes, not 16, meaning meerkat \" is already the best radio telescope in the southern hemisphere, \" says camilo. \" when the 64 dishes are in place next year, it will be the best telescope, not only in the southern hemisphere but in the world, \" adds pandor. When it hits full capacity in the 2020s, ska \" will have a discovery potential 10,000 times greater than the most advanced modern instruments, \" reports afp.

Uk researchers who surveyed drug watchdogs around the world uncovered 47 cases of sudden hearing loss linked to viagra and related drugs.

Meanwhile, reuters reports that a new us study finds that taking viagra could double one's chance of experiencing hearing loss. It found that one in three men over 40 who took the drug had hearing loss; of those not taking it, only one in six did. Scientists say they are not sure how anti-impotence medicine could affect hearing, but suspect a chain of chemical reactions caused by the drugs could be harming the inner ear.

May have violated federal criminal statutes prohibiting solicitation or acceptance of anything of value from a foreign national. Staffers are expected to focus on the 2016 meeting, also attended by trump son-in-law jared kushner and then-campaign head paul manafort, but they could also probe other possible connections trump's family had with russia. Trump jr. Agreed to the interview in july after the senate judiciary committee subpoenaed him and manafort ( subpoenas were withdrawn after the two agreed to be interviewed privately ). Committee chair chuck grassley said they'd both eventually be questioned in a public hearing. Per politico, trump jr. Has also agreed to hand over relevant documents. Manafort met privately with senate intel staff in july; kushner met with senate intel staff and house intelligence committee members. Trump jr. Is also expected to appear before the senate intelligence committee. The house intel panel has sought to talk to him as well, though that's reportedly being negotiated.",

After nightfall, a small group remained and the scene turned to one of disorder, following the pattern of friday and saturday. Protesters smashed windows and attempted to block a ramp to an interstate highway, police and witnesses said. Officers tackled some protesters who defied police orders and used pepper spray before starting the mass arrests. At a late-night news conference, mayor lyda krewson noted that \"the vast majority of protesters are non-violent, \" and blamed the trouble on \"a group of agitators. \" acting police commissioner lawrence o'toole struck a hard stance, saying: \"we're in control, this is our city and we're going to protect it. \"",
            "Protesters gather, friday, sept. 15, 2017, in st. Louis, after a judge found a white former st. Louis police officer, jason stockley, not guilty of first-degree murder in the death of a black man, anthony... ( associated press ) st. Louis ( ap ) — hundreds of people protesting the acquittal of a white former st. Louis police officer in the fatal shooting of black man following a high-speed chase marched for hours in mostly peaceful demonstrations, until a broken window at the mayor's home and escalating tensions led riot-gear-clad officers to lob tear gas to disperse the crowds. Activists had for weeks threatened civil disobedience if jason stockley were not convicted in the death of anthony lamar smith, stirring fears of civil unrest and the erecting of barricades around police headquarters, the courthouse where the trial was held and other potential protest sites. A racially diverse crowd of protesters — some carrying weapons, as allowed by state law, and others toting children and waving posters — took to the streets",

        "summary": "The petsitting company suing a texas couple over their negative yelp review now wants even more money from the couple. As consumerist reports, prestigious pets ' original lawsuit, which sought less than $ 7,000, was quickly dropped — only to be replaced with this new suit, which seeks between $ 200,000 and $ 1 million. Prestigious pets originally argued that robert and michelle douchouquette violated a non-disparagement clause in the petsitting contract by posting the bad review, in which the couple complained about some of the company's policies and alleged the petsitter may have harmed their fish. The new suit still alleges the non-disparagement clause was violated, and adds two more claims: defamation and business disparagement. Prestigious pets says the bad review and the ensuing bad publicity have led to threats and harassment and left the company a \" shell of its former success, \" cbs dfw reports. \" you'd think that what really damaged the reputation of the company was bringing the suit in the first place, \" says paul levy of public citizen, a consumer advocacy group representing the douchouquettes pro bono. A warning that now pops up on prestigious pets ' yelp page reads, \" you should know this business has issued legal threats and/or taken legal action against reviewers for exercising their free speech. If your review accurately describes your firsthand experience, you have a first amendment right to express your opinion on yelp. \" a court will soon determine whether the petsitters ' lawsuit is frivolous, in which case the douchouquettes could seek to have it dismissed.

A study from economists at mit and boston university published this month by the national bureau of economic research attempts to quantify the effects of industrial automation on american employment. It found that between 1990 and 2007, each robot added to the workforce reduced employment in the local commuting area by three to six jobs, quartz reports. The addition of one robot per thousand workers also lowered wages by 0.25 % to 0.5 %. Overall, the report estimates robots cost the us between 360,000 and 670,000 jobs total during the span in question, according to the verge. But robots don't affect all jobs equally. Unsurprisingly, robots had the biggest impact on the wages of america's lowest earners — blue collar workers and those without a college education — and could be responsible for growing the wage gap, bloomberg reports. The automotive industry has taken the brunt of the robot uprising, with 39 % of the us ' industrial robots working in that industry. Some experts expect the number of robots working in the us to more than double by 2025 to more than 3 million. And it remains to be seen whether the market will find new jobs for humans, as it has after the advent of new technologies in the past, or whether robots will continue to depress employment and wages into the future.

            "The fear that automation in the form of robots or artificial intelligence is going to destroy jobs is widespread. But it can be difficult to gauge just how serious to take the threat. Different reports offer different estimations of how many jobs will be lost, while politicians and economists argue that technology creates as many jobs as it destroys, maintaining an equilibrium in employment over the long run. But is this really true? a new study from the national bureau of economic research aims to add some solid numbers to the debate, looking at the historical effects of robots on employment in the us.

The golden state has been getting bombarded with precipitation — rain, snow, hail, sleet — making even los angeles feel \" more like london than southern california, \" the los angeles times notes. But for a parched state that's been plagued by a drought lasting more than five years, this wet weather is not only good for 2017 — it could bring an official end to the drought altogether. The weather network reports a \" great improvement, \" particularly in california's northern third, and the first third of january has been \" exceptional \" for rainfall and snow accumulation. About 42 % of california is now drought free, the ap reports ( a more specific breakdown can be found at the us drought monitor ). The prospect of an end to the drought is \" kind of a nice thing to think about, \" a state climatologist tells the times. But mother nature still has a lot of work to do. The unpredictable weather patterns that often come with la niña conditions, expected to last throughout the winter, mean there's no guarantee the storms will keep raining their soggy gifts down. And semantics could complicate a declaration of \" this is the end, \" as there's no set parameter to gauge if a drought has indeed come to a close ( it would officially be deemed over if gov. Jerry brown pulls or changes a january 2014 emergency drought order he issued, per the mercury news ). Still, there's reason to be hopeful: last week alone, the storms dumped more than 350 billion gallons of water into the state's thirsty reservoirs, boosting water levels to long-forgotten marks. \" it's early.

What's more, average wages rose.5 % to $ 25.39, \" another sign of a healthy labor market, \" observes marketwatch. Growth, however, appears to be slowing: employers added 151,000 jobs, short of the expected 185,000 and well off december's newly adjusted figure of 262,000. Volatility in the world's markets may have unnerved employers, and a snowy month probably didn't help. Investors digesting the report didn't seem pleased: stock futures were dropping. As usual, the report will add to speculation on whether the fed chooses to again raise interest rates, though another jobs report will be out before that march decision. And this one isn't much help in reading the tea leaves. \"if people were looking for support from the data to say the fed is going to get off the tightening path, i don't think the data is conclusive enough for us to feel that way, \" an investment officer at oppenheimerfunds tells the wall street journal.",

People have long believed that the fifth us president lived in a modest, two-bedroom house at highland, his homestead from 1799 to 1823 located near charlottesville. But new evidence suggests the home monroe referred to as his \" cabin castle \" was, as the washington post puts it, \" more castle than cabin. \" archaeologists last year discovered the foundation of a much larger dwelling on the 535-acre property, the williamsburg yorktown daily reports. The footprint of the larger house is about 74 by 30 feet, per the new york times. The still-standing cottage is now believed to have been quarters for the guests of monroe, who served as president from 1817 to 1825. The search for the remains of a larger structure at highland were spurred by test results that showed wood from the cottage was cut between 1815 and 1818, years after monroe moved to the estate. Those results jibe with a 1818 letter monroe sent to his son in which he references a newly built guesthouse. Furthermore, 19th-century newspaper accounts mention the destruction of the monroe house. Archaeologists have discovered rubble and charred wood indicating that the larger house was destroyed by fire. \"what else haven't we realized? \" sara bon-harper, who oversees the property for the college of william and mary, tells the post. \"it's a much different story than we have been able to see before. \" visitors to highland, fairly close to thomas jefferson's monticello residence, now receive updated information about the property to reflect the new discovery.

That's the heftiest hike on record, reports the wall street journal, and comes as the average state funding per student fell 9 %. That, too, is a record, the biggest drop since the state higher education executive officers association started keeping track in 1980 ( you can read the association's original report here ). But that bad news masks some good: 31 states actually increased their funding last year, but the worse-off states dragged the stats down. California alone saw a 14.3 % slash in per-student funding, and florida has cut funding to its state universities by $ 1 billion over the past six years, even as enrollment climbed by 35,000. At penn state, state funding now comprises just 14 % of the university's budget, down from 62 % in 1970. \" unless we make public funding a higher priority, the funds are going to have to come from parents and students, \" says one economist.",

The city is known for its impressive architectural feats, but one structure in the works has the potential to be more awe-inspiring than the rest. Dynamic architecture is designing an 80-story tower that qualifies as a shape-shifter, at times transforming from a curvy design to one that resembles a stack of jenga blocks, as each apartment rotates 360 degrees. To visualize what cnn calls the \" first rotating skyscraper, \" see this your discovery science video. In it, architect david fisher explains that the 1,273-foot dynamic tower \" will never look the same \" because each resident will have control over the position of their apartment and the speed at which it spins around a stationary core. Fisher says he was inspired by a visit to new york's olympic tower, in which he saw the appeal of a rotating floor offering 360-degree views of a city, per dynamic architecture's website. But a view of both the sunrise and sunset wouldn't the only perk for residents, who would have to shell out up to $ 40 million. They would also receive free electricity from 79 wind turbines sandwiched between the building's floors, and a special elevator would let them to park their vehicles outside their apartments. So when and where exactly? stay tuned. Fisher says he's planning to have it built by 2020, but no details were provided beyond that, reports the national. A post at what'son.ae notes that dynamic has registered for the appropriate patents, suggesting that it's indeed serious about what the site calls its \" dancing tower. \" ( there could be a new tallest building by 2020. )",

Eleven rig workers were killed. The company will plead guilty to the charge and pay the maximum fine of $ 200,000, the justice department announced. Halliburton also made a voluntary $ 55 million payment to the national fish and wildlife foundation. Halliburton destroyed the evidence during an internal investigation into what went wrong and who was to blame. Bp owned the well, but halliburton oversaw the pouring of cement during its drilling, explains the times-picayune of new orleans. Halliburton recommended that bp use 21 \" centralizers, \" or metal collars, on the well, but bp used only six. When halliburton ran simulated tests during its spill investigation, the results showed that it made little difference whether bp used six or 21. That didn't please halliburton execs, so they ordered the results destroyed, say the feds. They did the same with results from a second simulation that reached the same conclusion.

The 38-year-old was found hanged in the building where he planned to open a brewery, and authorities suspect suicide, the chicago tribune reports. Cantu achieved incredible success: after working with late chef charlie trotter for four years, he became executive chef and then an owner at moto, a michelin-starred restaurant; he also opened his own eateries and was, nbc chicago reports, the founder of a food tech design firm — but in recent days, his professional life had taken a dark turn. An investor in moto and ing, a now-closed cantu restaurant, sued cantu last month, accusing him of using moto's account for personal expenses, failing to pay the investor owed profits, and using moto's profits to keep ing from failing. A fellow chef collaborated with cantu late last month and spoke to him about the lawsuit — which, eater chicago noted after it was filed, threatened to force cantu out of moto. \" he told me, ' what are you gonna do? i ' m going to work through it, ' \" the chef says. \" but he definitely wasn't in the happiest spirit.

Authorities say a man with a rifle opened fire on on people in a residential neighborhood. According to cbs los angeles, police officers \" were met with gunfire \" and \" pinned down \" when they arrived on the scene tuesday afternoon in azusa. At least three other people were injured, and at least one of the victims was on their way to vote. A voter at a nearby polling place tells cnn he heard shots fired and then a bunch of people ran into the polling place before police locked it down. \" at first, i thought it was construction, but people came running into the room saying they see a guy with a bulletproof vest, \" another voter says. A second polling place and a middle school were also locked down. A los angeles county official says \" voters should avoid the area and, if necessary, cast a ballot at an alternate polling location, \" ktla reports. Residents are being told to shelter in place. Multiple police and swat vehicles were on the scene, and three civilian vehicles were crashed near the scene of the shooting. It's unclear if the crash was related. The conditions of those injured in the shooting are unknown. It's also unclear if any police officers are among the injured or deceased.",

After all, those buying bouquets don't really care about a flower's ability to attract pollinators. A new study in the journal science, however, may help restore the distinct aroma to roses that have become less potent over time. Experts were already aware of some 400 chemical compounds, the majority of which are alcohols, responsible for the scent of roses, popular science reports. This finding surrounds alcohols known as monoterpenes and what french researchers say was a previously unknown gene. Roses that \" strongly expressed the gene produced more monoterpenes and had stronger scents, \" discover explains. The gene, called rhnudx1, was revealed as researchers compared the genomes of fragrant papa meilland roses — 70 % of their scent comes from monoterpenes — and scentless rouge meilland roses. In papa meilland roses, the rhnudx1 enzyme produced a monoterpene called geraniol, which is actually the main component of rose oil. The gene was also found in rouge meilland roses, but it appeared to have been \" turned off. \" an analysis of 10 other rose varieties proved roses with the active gene produced more monoterpenes and smelled sweeter. With a little meddling, scientists say the gene could be reactivated in less-potent flowers. As they found no genetic link between scent and a rose's ability to stay fresh after it's been cut, they add breeders may soon get their rose and smell it, too.

In an opinion piece in the journal of the american medical association, the two argue that \" there is substantial waste in the education and training of us physicians. Years of training have been added without evidence that they enhance clinical skills. \" just how long does it take to become an md from start to finish? fourteen years. One part of that is medical school, and they argue that the only reason that stage is four years long is because of a report recommending that length — published in 1910. Most doctors could be trained far faster, and a few schools are already speeding up their programs. They propose trimming the total training time by 30 %, to 10 years, which could in turn trim doctors'salaries. As the washington post notes, the average doctor graduates with $ 160,000 in student debt. That cost is often used to justify doctors'salaries, which are twice as high in the us as in most other countries.",

Yet most physicians could be trained in significantly less time. Since 1997, the university of pennsylvania has only 1 years of preclinical science training. The important patient care skills can be obtained in less than 2 years of clinical training.

But this year we get to party like it's 1977 when the moon is shown in its full glory on dec. 25, the weather channel reports. It's an event that won't happen again until 2034, and then every 19 years after that for a few cycles, the independent explains. But it really has been a full 38 years since the last christmas day full moon, though the independent notes we were psyched out in both 2004 and 2007, when the moon appeared full on christmas, but was actually full on dec. 26 and christmas eve, respectively. In other full-moon trivia, this full moon even has its own set of nicknames: the full cold moon, the tribal name of full long nights moon, and the moon before yule ( space.com has a complete list of what every full moon of the year is called ). To catch a glimpse of the moon in peak mode this time around, you ' ll have to get up early — it's set for maximum fullness at 6: 11am est, a nasa moon expert tells the weather channel — but people with young kids will probably be woken up that early anyway to open gifts. As a bit of a cheat, the weather channel recommends people simply view the moon at night on christmas eve, when it ' ll essentially appear to be full. ( don't worry, you likely won't end up in the er on christmas day because of this. )",

Rickles died thursday morning at his home in los angeles from kidney failure, his longtime publicist paul shefrin confirmed. He would have turned 91 on may 8. Though he appeared in films and on television, rickles ' mainstay was always nightclub performances, appearing in las vegas and elsewhere into his late 80s. He also found late success as the voice of mr. Potato head in the \"toy story \" films, which were exceptional box office performers, and popped up frequently on latenight talkshows. Rickles ' career had its ups and downs as comedic tastes changed, and his curmudgeonly persona was sometimes out of kilter with audience tastes, but he survived long after many of his contemporaries had disappeared into retirement. And when he was hot, he was a potent club headliner, insulting his audience with his two key signature phrases \"dummy \" and \"hockey puck. \" his attempts at series tv did not succeed because of the astringency of rickles ' personality. His serious side, however, was occasionally put to good use in guest starring roles in episodic tv and the occasional dramatic role in movies"

        "summary": "A north korean government spy was charged thursday in connection with cyberattacks including the 2014 sony hacking scandal, the ap reports. It was the first time the us has brought computer hacking charges against a pyongyang operative, the washington post reports. Park jin hyok, accused of hacking on behalf of north korea's military intelligence agency, is also allegedly linked to the lazarus group, which has been implicated in other cyberattacks including the wannacry computer virus. He is believed to be in north korea currently. Also thursday, the treasury department is expected to announce sanctions on north koreans linked to the attacks. The 2017 wannacry ransomware attack paralyzed computers by encrypting files, then demanding money to un-encrypt them. The 2014 sony attack, among other things, resulted in the release of sensitive internal documents including emails; one executive ultimately lost her job as a result. Sony also canceled its planned release of the interview, a film about two americans trying to assassinate kim jong un, as a result of the attack, abc news reports. Per the new york times, the us has been attempting to indict the alleged hacker for some time, but since much of the evidence against him is classified, it could not be included in a criminal indictment.",

Ownbey had been through a milder episode before. A tornado hit part of his district in 2009, destroying a mobile-home park. It turned the neighbourhood into \" a landfill \", he says. Afterwards ownbey tried to get a bill passed that would require mobile-home parks to offer emergency plans to residents.

In other words, they suggest the existence of planets too far away for our telescopes to see. Scientists only learned about these stars 12 years ago, shortly after the first planets beyond our solar system were discovered in the 1990s, which is why a new study has many feeling like they've just been hit by an asteroid, per discovery news. It turns out the first evidence of planetary systems around a white dwarf was captured in 1917 — more than 50 years before we set foot on the moon. While researching an article about a white dwarf called van maanen's star, jay farihi of university college london surveyed a glass photographic plate in the carnegie observatories ' collection — made by former director walter adams in 1917 — which shows an image of the light the star emits. As farihi discovered, it also shows evidence that the light passed through debris, suggesting an exoplanet is orbiting the star, report cnet and gizmodo. Farihi says it's only a matter of time before astronomers discover it. \" the unexpected realization that this 1917 plate from our archive contains the earliest recorded evidence of a polluted white dwarf system is just incredible, \" adds carnegie observatories'director. \" we have a ton of history sitting in our basement and who knows what other finds we might unearth in the future? \" ( this is the biggest known structure in the galaxy. )",

The aclu reports her release comes just days after it filed suit to bring together the mother, who'd been kept in san diego's otay mesa detention center, and daughter, held in a chicago refugee resettlement facility. \" we are thrilled that the mother has been released and look forward to the government immediately reuniting her with her daughter, \" says aclu attorney lee gelernt. \" but there remain many other families who have been separated, and we will continue to attack this horrific family separation practice. \" gelernt tells the ap that orders for the mother's release came \" from up top \" in the department of homeland security. Judy rabinovitz, deputy director of the aclu's immigrants ' rights project, tells the post that \" obviously dhs was feeling some pressure \" over the \" unconscionable \" separation. One logistical snag, per gelernt: the mother was abruptly let out as a \" mandatory release \" without any arrangements as to where she'd go next, per the chicago tribune, which calls the case \" absurd. \" another lawyer was apparently able to quickly step in and get a hotel room for her, but gelernt says he thinks \" they won't reunite her with her daughter until she has a stable place, \" which is the aclu's next goal.

The harvard business review's daily stat points to a study that showed waitresses who stood about 6 inches from patrons, as opposed to 2.5 feet, improved their tips by 22.6 %. The study, originally published in the journal of hospitality &amp; tourism research, also found that tips were boosted when waitresses smiled broadly, touched customers briefly on the arm or shoulder, or squatted by the table to introduce themselves. In good, alex goldmark notes that it's simply a \"natural human reaction \" to reward servers who increase intimacy, but adds that another — notably less scientific — experiment by this american life in 2003 found that \"aloof \" waitresses actually earned higher tips than \"super-friendly \" ones. \"add it all up, and the path to maximum gratuity earnings might be standing up close and personal \" while \"acting distant and impersonal. \"",

The find \" documents deliberate planning, production, and curation of a pigmented compound, and the first recorded use of containers, \" writes christopher henshilwood, an anthropologist at the institute for human evolution at the university of witwatersrand in johannesburg, in an email exchange. The find indicates that humans at this period \" had an elementary knowledge of chemistry and the ability for long-term planning. \" in pictures: painted faces the earliest evidence for ocher production dates back roughly 160,000 years, according to research published in 2007. The evidence came from caves in cliffs near south africa's mossel bay, suggesting that humans had developed a sense of symbolism far earlier than previous studies had suggested. Within the next 40,000 years the use of ocher would become widespread in the region, researchers say. In 2009, another team, led by dr. Henshilwood, unveiled the earliest direct evidence"

Holtzclaw, charged with raping 13 black women while on duty, was convicted of four counts of rape ( as well as 14 other counts ) thursday. He's staring at as many as 260 years. Holtzclaw's crimes stretched from late 2013 until the night he pulled over ligons.

        "summary": "Beyonce blew the world's collective mind when she released a new album seemingly out of thin air friday, and now a number of media outlets are tackling the inevitable question: how did she do it? code names were involved. The album was called \" lily, \" billboard reports, and the whole operation was referred to as \" tno \" for \" tell no one, \" adds the new york daily news. People learned about the project on a \" need to know \" basis. Only the top itunes executives knew about the plans and, according to vanity fair, only about 12 people on beyonce's sony records team knew the exact release date. And of course, everyone involved signed confidentiality agreements one person calls \" scary. \" even top staffers at columbia records had no idea what was going on: \" honestly, most of us found out [ about the release ] when everyone else did, \" one insider says. Working with itunes exclusively was a big factor, rolling stone points out: beyonce was able to give secret information only to apple employees, as opposed to including employees at amazon and other retailers. Collaborators, too, were kept as much in the dark as possible. A songwriter and producer who worked on one of the songs had no idea why he was being pressured to finish mixing and mastering it, and the writer and producer of another song says, \" i had no clue it was coming. \" amazingly, one of the videos actually includes a tmz employee, and yet even tmz failed to get the scoop. That's likely because dancers and other collaborators often didn't know exactly what they were working on. And they were never told song titles or given clues about when they might be released. Some of the videos were even recorded in studios \" on lockdown. \" and beyonce kept things fluid: she worked on the album for months, despite the fact that she was in the middle of a huge world tour ( radar has her grueling shooting schedule here; it involved eight different cities on four continents ), but the deadline wasn't finalized until a week before the release. That doesn't mean there weren't hints: people rounds up a number of them, including clues beyonce dropped on instagram and tumblr. For example, a few images shared on instagram were taken during the video shoot for \" blue, \" and some even ended up in the video.

The state's supreme court declined to hear the case last month, keeping the appeals court's decision in place and resulting in mcfadden's release. \" we are without remedy, \" da dan rubenstein lamented. \" if you've heard the phrase, ' he got off on a technicality,'this is exactly that situation, \" he added, per kkco. Rubenstein took to facebook to explain mcfadden's release at length so the community \" can take action at the next election of [ the ] court of appeals judges \" involved. It initially appeared mcfadden wouldn't have to add his name to any sex offender registry, since his crimes were officially vacated. He'd been convicted once before for sexually assaulting a child, but that conviction happened before it was required by law for sex offenders to add their names to a public register. However, rubenstein said thursday that mcfadden will have to register based on that 1990 case.

Alabama's board of pardons and paroles pardoned the last three today after a unanimous vote, the montgomery advertiser reports. Nine black teens were accused of the rapes in 1931; by 1937, haywood patterson, charlie weems, andy wright, and clarence norris had all been convicted of rape. The other five saw their charges dropped, and norris was pardoned in 1976 because, the ap reports, he was the only one known to be alive at the time; patterson, weems, and wright received full and unconditional pardons today. Why now? just last spring, the alabama legislature made posthumous pardons legal in convictions 80 years old or older, specifically so the scottsboro boys could be pardoned. It's not clear what happened to all nine men: patterson died in 1952 and wright is known to be buried in chattanooga, but as for the rest, many kept a low profile after it was all over, or even changed their names. \" with some of them, we really don't know if they died with their right name, or a different name, \" says an expert. \" they no longer wanted to be known. \" the case came to symbolize the deep racism in the south at that time, the los angeles times notes, with elements including \" a frame-up on the charges, a recanting by a key witness, conviction by an all-white jury, angry mobs, an attempted lynching, \" and poor legal representation for the teens.",

New research suggests the thinking behind this trend — that conflict between parents is so harmful to kids they should avoid shared custody — is all wrong. In fact, a team out of sweden reports in the journal of divorce &amp; remarriage that kids have a harder time missing one of their parents than they do coping with their parents not getting along. \" if you want to hasten the process of healing, or at least tolerance, the worst thing you can do is declare one person a winner and one person a loser, \" one expert tells the minneapolis star tribune. \" you're both winners. You're both going to be parents. That will actually diminish conflict. \" to test this, researchers analyzed data on more than 800 children in sweden's surveys of living conditions. Kids who live with just one of their parents are more likely to experience stress multiple times a week than kids in joint custody, they report in a press release. \" there has previously been a concern that shared physical custody could be an unstable living situation that can lead to children becoming more stressed, \" says researcher jani turunen. But, per the press release, he contends those concerns are built \" on theoretical assumptions rather than empirical research. \" shared custody allows children to maintain active relationships with both parents, gives them more resources that each parent has separate access to, and takes away worry over the parent they rarely see.

Those wary of establishing shared parenting argue that it places children in the middle of disagreements, pressures them into loyalty conflicts or forces them to side with one parent against the other. Their thinking is that it's better to formally place the children in mom's household for stability and let dad parent one night a week and every other weekend. In a new study, nielsen re-examined this notion — with surprising results. \"the role of conflict has too often been exaggerated and should not be the"

The app that lets you send messages that say \" yo \" ( yes, that's all it does ) was virtually unknown a week ago, but then it got a $ 1 million cash injection, prompting a flood of mostly incredulous news stories — and a lot of curious downloads. By yesterday it was on apple's top free apps list, and now three georgia tech students have hacked it, techcrunch reports. The hack, which yo has confirmed, allows the students to collect any user's phone number, spam users with \" yo \" s — or any other push notification — and much more. Another so far unconfirmed hack appears to allow yo to rickroll people. \" the lesson here, yo? the next time an app falls from the heavens and lands on everybody's phones, maybe we should think twice before installing it, \" writes alex fitzpatrick at time. Yo, developed in all of eight hours and suddenly instantly popular, \" certainly doesn't have anything resembling an effective internal security team, \" and was a \" prime target. \" meanwhile, over at the atlantic, ian bogost takes a more thoughtful look at the app, and while he thinks there's some honesty in its grand-yet-stupid ambition to formalize meta-communication, he also finds it kind of \" gross, \" both because \" yo \" is \" a dudebro's term \" that's \" stocky and aggressive, \" and because the app tries to \" contain all human activity within the logics of tech startups.

        "summary": "A mysterious package has emerged from a pink miami beach mansion once owned by colombian drug lord pablo escobar. The current owner, chicken kitchen founder christian de berdouare, bought the waterfront estate for $ 9.65 million in 2014 with the plan to tear down the old mansion, unaware of escobar's link to it. When he learned the former boss of the medellin cartel owned the home before it was seized by us authorities in 1987, he hired professional treasure hunters to sweep the place — a smart move given that escobar was known to hide goods in secret compartments in walls and floors. Among the discoveries: a \" suspicious \" foot-long cylinder wrapped in plastic and containing \" a white paste \" that was found beneath an old stove in the garage, says de berdouare. Police have concluded it doesn't contain cocaine or ecstasy, reports the miami herald, but further details on what it might be weren't available. Workers were also aware of a safe hidden beneath a tile under a marble staircase, but de berdouare says it was stolen \" within the last 30 days. \" authorities previously warned de berdouare that escobar's old cronies might try to recover some of his property, reports nbc news. \" we don't know what it had inside or if it was empty, \" he says. Demolition has since begun at the property, where de berdouare plans to build a new home. \" i ' m very excited to see the house of the devil disappearing right before our eyes, \" he tells the ap. \" this was the biggest criminal in the history of the world. \" his wife adds that \" there was a very negative energy inside the house, \" which she had blessed by a catholic priest before it was torn down. Nbc reports it isn't clear if escobar ever set foot in the house, which might simply have been a base for his cohorts. ( sean penn has some regrets about that el chapo interview. )",

But instead of assault, the lawsuit is going after cosby for defamation. Green says that cosby's denials of the alleged assault have hurt her reputation, and tmz reports that the legal tactic gives her a chance to sue cosby without running into statute-of-limitations problems: the alleged assault may be 40 years old, but cosby's denials are more recent. The hollywood reporter observes that while cosby's attorneys quickly reject the accusations of any women coming forward for the first time, they're far more careful when speaking about previous accusers. That might be because they're wary of opening him up to lawsuits by \" breaching any confidentiality obligations he has from prior settlements, \" writes eriq gardner. He notes that high-profile attorney gloria allred has challenged cosby to waive the statute of limitations on the abuse claims, but cosby hasn't obliged.",

Corey coleman — who resigned weeks ago, before the investigation concluded — allegedly sexually harassed subordinates, hired unqualified fraternity brothers and women he met on dating sites, and transferred women to regional offices so his friends could try to have sexual relationships with them. Fema administrator brock long says the investigation uncovered a \" systemic problem going on for years \" and some of the behavior could lead to criminal charges, if victims decide to contact the police. According to the report, coleman, who led the disaster agency's personnel department from 2011 until his resignation, had sexual relationships with at least two female subordinates, the ap reports. One woman said coleman kept pressuring her for dates after they broke up in 2015 and denied her a promotion when she refused. Coleman is also accused of creating a \" toxic \" work environment by intimidating staff members, reports nbc news. Long said in a statement monday that the report is being referred to the department of homeland security's internal watchdog. \" we must care for our own with the same respect, compassion, and advocacy that we bring to our external operations, \" he said.",

Space agency chief dmitry rogozin said the hole detected thursday in a russian space craft docked at the orbiting station was caused by a drill and could have been done deliberately, either back on earth or by astronauts in space. Astronauts used tape to seal the leak after it caused a small loss of pressure that was not life-threatening. \" there were several attempts at drilling, \" rogozin said late monday in televised comments. He added that the drill appeared to have been held by a \" wavering hand. \" \" what is this: a production defect or some premeditated actions? \" he asked. \" we are checking the earth version.

The shot, from johnson's smith &amp; wesson m&p.40 pistol, hit mcquilliams square in the chest and made the 15-year-veteran the toast of gun enthusiasts around the country. \"at a minimum, it was extraordinary shot, \" said army maj.

His death comes 179 years after his father, luke martin sr., was born, the ap reports. The elder martin escaped slavery in hertford, north carolina, heading to new bern after union soldiers had taken it. He enlisted with one of the first black regiments and was wounded in battle in florida. Later, he worked as a mason; martin was his youngest child, the wilmington star-news reports. Martin jr.

As leaders hold emergency talks, six members of george papandreou's party have called for his resignation, and one has quit, leaving his party's majority at two, the bbc reports. The opposition party wants an election, while a top mp from papandreou's party wants to form a unity \"government of national salvation, \" to be followed by elections. \"in order to save himself, mr papandreou has posed a dilemma of blackmail that puts our future and our position in europe in danger, \" the opposition leader says. Papandreou will meet with angela merkel and nicolas sarkozy tomorrow on the sidelines of the g20 summit. He says the referendum is needed in order to put austerity measures in place. The new york times warns that friday's planned confidence vote could lead to a government collapse, ending hopes for a bailout and ultimately prompting a default and the end of the euro in greece.

According to research published in the new england journal of medicine, the gene acts as a \" switch \" for other genes that affect whether energy from what people eat is stored as fat or burned off. People who inherited a faulty version of the gene from one parent, and especially those who inherited faulty versions from both parents, are a lot more likely to be obese. The researchers discovered that a gene editing sequence can reverse the effect, reports the telegraph, which predicts that \" a cure for obesity could be just an injection away, \" though the ap notes that a lot of testing lies ahead before a safe treatment can hit the market — and since the gene problem is widespread in white people but is found in only 5 % of black people, \" other genes are clearly at work. \" still, experts call the finding a \" big deal \" with plenty of promise for treating obesity. \" obesity has traditionally been seen as the result of an imbalance between the amount of food we eat and how much we exercise, but this view ignores the contribution of genetics to each individual's metabolism, \" an mit researcher tells discovery.",

But when the heiress was murdered in 1977, her killers took only about $ 3 million of it ( $ 1.7 million of it was found buried in the arizona desert ) and about $ 5 million was recovered at the home, leading to the question: is more of jackson's money still out there? an 81-year-old reporter who's been nominated for two pulitzers thinks maybe, that an fbi agent assigned to the case may have lifted it, and that the fbi may have covered the whole thing up to save its reputation. The story is a fascinating one with plenty of curiosities, the star reports. One is jackson herself, a recluse who left a place setting for jesus in her dining room and gifts scattered around her home labeled \" to god from marjorie. \" the two convicted of killing her were an odd couple, too, with one described by the ex-prosecutor as a \" hip, inner-city black, \" the other an \" ignorant hillbilly. \" but reporter don devereux is most intrigued by the info he uncovered while digging into the case, including financial and property files he obtained from the fbi that suggest a now-deceased agent may have skimmed some of the cash from the desert dig ( or from another location harboring more money ), funneled it into a swiss bank account, and then used it years later to buy real estate. \" i ' m not accusing the fbi agent of anything, but it sounds like there could be something to it, \" jackson's 69-year-old nephew tells the star.

According to insiders, trump jr. Met with a small group at trump tower in august 2016: an envoy for two arab princes, an israeli expert in social media manipulation, and the founder of the private military contractor blackwater. The envoy, george nader, apparently said the crown princes of united arab emirates and saudi arabia were intent on helping his father become president. The social media whiz, joel zamel, said his firm could give a political candidate the edge. In fact, his firm had already written a proposal to give donald trump just that. Trump jr. \" responded approvingly, \" the times says, but it's unclear if the zamel plan was ever executed. As for nader, he allied with the trump campaign and met regularly with michael flynn and jared kushner. After trump's election win, nader paid zamel up to $ 2 million, possibly for a pro-trump media campaign. Blackwater founder erik prince arranged the meeting, and could be in trouble after telling a house intelligence committee last november, under oath, that he'd never formally met with the trump campaign, mother jones reports. Now mueller is investigating the 2016 meeting and its ramifications, including possible support from russia. The wall street journal already reported last month that mueller's team was questioning zamel about the activities of his israeli firm, wikistrat.",

They have already received offers from traders in the united arab emirates and saudi arabia, and an auction is expected this week. Ambergris is produced in the digestive tracts of sperm whales and released as feces or vomit into the ocean, where it slowly hardens and floats.

If you find one of these, you might hope for ambergris – sometimes referred to as \"whale vomit \" – as one couple recently reported finding in morecambe bay in lancashire, uk. Described as floating gold, it's a highly-prized natural treasure used by past kings and still sought after by artisan perfumers. According to reports, this latest could be worth £ 50,000 ( us$ 71,000 ) for a 1.57kg lump. So what exactly is ambergris and why does it still cost more than gold or truffles? the reason for the high prize lies in the origin of ambergris. It is a product of the sperm whale, as only sperm whales make the compound responsible for ambergris ' allure: ambrein. Different organisms biosynthesise different compounds, such as caffeine made by cocoa, coffee or tea plants. Ambrein is made by sperm whales only to glue together squid beaks. Squid is the main"

What's more, van zant says the film also violates a 1988 consent order governing use of the band's name, along with the name, likeness, and biography of her former husband, reports courthouse news. Band members johnny van zant ( ronnie's brother ) and gary rossington, as well as representatives for deceased members allen collins and steve gaines ( who died in the crash ), also protest the film, which offers former lynyrd skynyrd drummer artimus pyle's opinion on what happened. Pyle, one of 20 people to survive the crash, \" is free to exploit his own personal life story, \" but the film's improper use of the name and history of lynyrd skynyrd and its \" potentially inaccurate or skewed portrayal … of a defining moment in the band's history \" will cause considerable loss and harm, the plaintiffs say, per reuters. Cleopatra ceo brian perera maintains he's not in the wrong. He hopes to release the film, which cleopatra lawyers say will clearly acknowledge it's not authorized by the band, in 2018.",
