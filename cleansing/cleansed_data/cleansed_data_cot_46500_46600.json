        "summary": "A retired nasa astronaut who flew on five space shuttle missions has been charged with murder after an early-morning car crash in alabama took the lives of two young half-sisters, per al.com. A 2015 chrysler allegedly being driven by james halsell jr., 59, smashed into a ford fiesta at around 2: 50am monday just east of tuscaloosa; 11-year-old niomi deona james and 13-year-old jayla latrice parler, neither of whom was wearing a seatbelt, were ejected from the vehicle, police say. Niomi died at the scene of the accident, while jayla died later at a local hospital. The driver of the fiesta, 37-year-old pernell deon james ( officials say he's the girls'dad ), and another passenger, 25-year-old shontel latriva cutts, were also injured in the wreck. The ap notes that james was said to be in good condition and ready for release tuesday from a tuscaloosa hospital, while cutts remains in fair condition. Meanwhile, state troopers say an initial examination of the crash suggests speed and alcohol may have both been factors. Halsell has been charged with murder, and a spokesman for the tuscaloosa county sheriff's office says he was released on $ 150,000 bond monday evening. Per his nasa bio page, halsell's stint with nasa started in 1990 and notched him more than 1,250 hours in space, including as the pilot on two space shuttle trips and commander on three others. After the 2003 columbia disaster that killed all seven crew members, halsell was the leader of the space shuttle program's \" return-to-flight \" planning initiative. He retired from the space agency in 2006.",

The one stand-out finding: the lower the handlebars, the greater the trouble. If a woman has to lean forward more to reach low handlebars, that means she's putting more pressure in sensitive areas, which can lead to numbness. \"we're basically showing that there may be modifiable risk factors associated with female riders, \" says a female yale professor who co-wrote the study. \"this better positions us to educate riders on safe riding practices that may actually be beneficial to reduction of pressure and lost sensation in the pelvic floor. \" the study, which looked at about 50 women who rode at least 10 miles a week, is online here.",

Many women who cycle or take spin classes are familiar with the numbness that sometimes can occur from sitting on a traditional bike seat. Bike seats are designed in such a way that body weight typically rests on the nose of the seat, which can compress nerves and blood vessels in the genital area. In men, this raises the risk of erectile dysfunction, something that has been documented in studies of male police officers on bicycle patrol. But female cyclists have not been studied as closely. A study by yale researchers in 2006 found that female cyclists had less genital sensation compared with a control group of female runners. As a result, some scientists believe that female cyclists probably are at similar risk for sexual problems as male riders. In the latest study, the yale researchers tried to determine whether there are specific factors that influence soreness and numbness among female riders. Forty-eight women took part in the study, each a consistent rider who cycled a minimum of 10 miles a week, but typically much more. The women took their personal bikes and saddles into the lab. The researchers mounted the bikes on a stationary machine",

Methods: previously, we compared genital sensation in competitive female cyclists ( n = 48 ) to that of female runners ( n = 22 ). The current study is a subanalysis of the 48 cyclists from the original study group. Nonpregnant, premenopausal women who rode at least 10 miles per week, 4 weeks per month were eligible for participation. Main outcome measures: genital sensation was measured in microns using biosthesiometry measures of vibratory thresholds ( vts ). Perineal and total saddle pressures were determined using a specialized pressure map and recorded in kilopascals ( kpa ). Results: handlebars positioned lower than the saddle correlated with increased perineum saddle pressures and decreased anterior vaginal and left labial genital sensation ( p < 0.05, p < 0.02, p < 0.03, respectively ). Low handlebars were not associated with total saddle pressures or altered genital sensation in other areas.

Macewan university in edmonton discovered the fraud on aug. 23, when a construction company it works with asked why it had yet to be paid. But the school had made payments to what it thought was the company: $ 1.9 million on aug. 10, $ 22,000 on aug. 17, and $ 9.9 million on aug. 19 — a total of $ 11.8 million to a fraudulent account, with the money eventually being traced to canada and hong kong, reports the cbc. The school has launched a full investigation, but has preliminarily pegged the scam to a series of emails and a website that used the vendor's authentic logo and claimed the vendor had a new bank account. For now, the school says it is down to \" human error, \" where lower-level staffers failed to verify the bank account change was legitimate, so the transfers went to the phony vendor. Canada's advanced education minister issued a statement expressing his disappointment. \" this is unacceptable, \" he says. \" i expect post-secondary institutions to do better to protect public dollars against fraud. \" the loss is 10 % of the university's entire annual operating grant from the alberta government, reports the edmonton journal, with a $ 118 million grant provided in 2015 for the school's $ 237.1 million budget. One expert calls it the \" single largest publicly disclosed amount i've seen \" lost to a phishing scam, while noting that private companies may have fallen victim to similar scams but have not been required to disclose the amount lost. Macewan says its computer systems have not been compromised, per the toronto star, and that it expects to recoup the $ 11.4 million it's managed to trace, though $ 400,000 remains missing.

Born with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy due to a lack of oxygen that damaged certain motor functions in her brain, she didn't learn to walk until she was 3 years old, used crutches and a four-point cane to get around as a kid, and still struggles with balance and coordination. But as the washingtonian reports, the determined advocate for people with disabilities had fallen in love with running the year before and vowed, quietly, to complete 34 races in the year leading up to her 34th birthday. What she didn't anticipate was the following she'd amass as people gathered and waited from one race to the next to cheer watts on as she crossed the finish line — dead last, every time. Many hours and falls later, watts completed her mission. It wasn't easy, as she reports in pacers running, but she had the help of race organizers who offered her head starts and an escort for most races. Watts runs a 30-minute mile; the first time she tried a 10-mile race she said she knew she could go six but said \" it's going to be my friends that get me through the last four. \" when she crossed the finish line, six hours and 32 minutes later, a crowd greeted the running community's new hero, and race organizer and friend lisa reeves was the first to hug her. \" it's just inspiring and it gives you a reason to keep going every day, \" reeves says in a pacers running video. Watts went on to complete 40 runs by her 34th birthday and another 36 by her 35th. In may, she set off at 2: 28am to run her first half marathon and finished in seven hours and 53 minutes. ( this woman's half marathon pace is just over 5 minutes, even after having her second baby. )",

Pending senate confirmation, us rep. Mick mulvaney of south carolina will head the office of management and budget, trump announced saturday. The washington post notes mulvaney, elected during the tea party wave in 2010, has been an \" outspoken fiscal hawk \" who's pushed for spending cuts even when they force him to oppose his own party, as he has on defense spending. \" you can't just like spending that your party wants and dislike spending the other party wants, \" the journal quotes mulvaney as saying. As budget director, mulvaney will be involved in shaping many of trump's proposals, likely including changes to the tax code, increased spending on infrastructure, and the repeal of obamacare. Trump says mulvaney will help his administration \" make smart choices about america's budget, \" reuters reports. But many of trump's proposals seem to go against mulvaney's staunch opposition to increasing the national debt. Trump wants $ 1 trillion in new infrastructure spending — an amount opposed by republican leaders — and it's unclear where that money will come from. He also wants increased defense spending, which mulvaney himself has opposed. Finally, nonpartisan experts say trump's tax plan alone would add at least $ 2.6 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years.",

Dan lipinski, an illinois democrat apparently seeking the title of hero to the american traveler. Lipinski has put forth a bill called the comfortable and fair flights act of 2015, reports fox news, which tells airlines \" don't even think about it \" in a number of ways — including banning so-called \" pee fees. \" per a lipinski statement: \" more and more, airline passengers... Expect to suffer from uncomfortable conditions. One thing they should never have to worry about is access to a bathroom. Unfortunately, commercial flights are not required to depart with a functioning bathroom, sometimes forcing passengers to endure a trip without this basic necessity. Moreover, as ancillary fees continue to grow, the specter of an in-flight bathroom fee continues to loom. \" but lipinski's bill doesn't just deal in future hypotheticals: as popular mechanics notes, the bill \" carries [ an ] interesting addendum, and one that is frankly more likely to affect travelers: all airlines would be forced to refund extra checked bag fees to anyone who has the arrival of their bag delayed by two or more hours. \" or, as lipinski puts it: \" simply put, if you pay for a service, you should get that service promptly or get your money back. \"",

The move comes less than a month after apple booted tumblr from its app store because an audit turned up child pornography, though tumblr says the issue goes beyond that. As the daily beast reports, porn stars, \" cam girls, \" and others in the sex trade have long used the platform for publicity, and now they're worried. \" it was pretty much panic from all of us, \" a 28-year-old sex worker tells the website. \" [ we're ] talking about if we're going to be able to keep our blogs or if we're going to have to just abandon tumblr and work on different platforms. \" the changes are effective dec. 17, and tumblr's new \" community guidelines \" section spells them out: \" don't upload images, videos, or gifs that show real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples. \" depictions of sex acts are barred, though written erotica is still permitted. If you're wondering about a certain phrase above, you're not alone. \" what the hell are ' female-presenting nipples '? \" wonders jezebel blogger harron walker, who has reached out to tumblr for clarification and is posting best guesses in the meantime.

She hired the law offices of tuan a. Khuu and associates to help her figure out her insurance and damages, ars technica reports. But she says the law firm was less than satisfactory. According to the houston chronicle, cai says they ignored her phone calls and emails, put a lien on her insurance, and even came into her bedroom while she was sleeping in her underwear ( \" super unprofessional! \" ). As a result, she left some bad reviews on yelp and facebook. Khuu attorney keith nguyen sued cai for libel after she refused to take down the bad reviews, seeking up to $ 200,000 from a student working six nights a week to put herself through nursing school. \" she needs to learn...

These laws protect consumers from businesses angry about online reviews. A judge threw out the libel lawsuit this week after fleming, working pro bono for cai, successfully argued that cai's negative reviews couldn't be proven false and that the khuu law firm wouldn't be hurt by them because they already have plenty of other negative reviews.

At 7: 30pm, the woman, angela wrightson, who was 39, returned home from the local shop in hartlepool and was never seen alive again, reports the bbc. The circumstances surrounding her death are now the subject of an intense court trial expected to last five weeks in which the girls are accused of not just murder but torture. The girls were in the care of social services at the time and had troubled relationships with their mothers. Their relationship with each other was described as \" intense. \" the first evidence of a problem was a snapchat image one of the defendants posted around 9pm, in which wrightson appears in the background not smiling and with visible, fresh marks on her face. The girls were caught on cctv leaving the home around 11pm, were asked by a friend why they had blood on their clothes, and then returned from 2am to 4am. Upon leaving, they called police for a ride home, which resulted in another snapchat image captioned, \"me and [ name ] in the back of the bizzie van again. \" the following day wrightson's landlord found her dead body, sitting upright on a couch, naked from the waist down, with more than 100 injuries, reports the guardian.

A couple of minutes later, jeff banta emerged and was also peacefully taken into custody. That's when the last holdout, david fry, apparently decided to renege on the deal to give himself up. \" unless my grievances are heard, i won't come out, \" he reportedly shouted, informing officials he was feeling suicidal as he sat alone in a tent. He then added: \" i have to stand my ground. It's liberty or death. I will not go another day as a slave to this system. \" among his grievances, per the times, is that his tax money is being used to fund abortions. Just before 11am pst, fry announced on the live feed that he was having one more cigarette and cookie, and then he said he was going out to meet with the authorities. The fbi confirmed at 11am that fry was in custody, per the oregonian. Gavin seim, a right-wing activist who had set up the live feed, said after fry had walked out that \" america needs to learn from what just happened here. David's concerns and his fears reflect what all of america feels. \" meanwhile, another feed moderator, krisanne hall, started sobbing when it was all over and said, \" i need a hot tub and a massage. \"",

The candidate told host larry king that it was \" probably unlikely \" that moscow is interfering in us elections and that claims that it is are probably coming from the democrats, politico reports. He also slammed the \" unbelievably dishonest \" american media and discussed third-party candidates, saying they appear to be fading away and he doesn't want to see libertarian candidate gary johnson on the debate stage. In other coverage: trump was strongly criticized for speaking to a network widely seen as having a strong pro-russia bias, with gop strategist john weaver calling it \" insanity, \" the washington post reports. The trump campaign said it thought the interview would appear on larry king's podcast, not on rt. The hill reports that during a speech in cleveland thursday, trump insisted that hillary clinton was lying when she said he was for the iraq war before he was against it. \" if i had been in congress at the time i would have cast a vote in opposition, \" he said. \" for years i've been a critic of these kinds of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been a hallmark of trigger-happy hillary and her failed career. \" the washington post looks at somebody who has been missing from the campaign trail since late july: melania trump. The possible first lady was in the audience for trump's appearance at a military forum on wednesday, but she hasn't spoken publicly since what turned out to be a partly plagiarized speech at the republican national convention and isn't expected to play a major role in the campaign's final weeks. The new york times examines the education plan trump unveiled in cleveland thursday. He promised $ 20 billion in federal funds to help poor students attend the schools of their choice, though it's not clear where he plans to find the $ 20 billion.

Even when banks reopen, limits on withdrawals are expected to remain, along with measures to prevent money from leaving the country, the bbc reports. Deposits above $ 130,000 in the two biggest banks, which will be subject to a stiff levy under the bailout deal, will be frozen. President nicos anastasiades didn't offer cypriots many details on the transaction limits that will be imposed, but told them, \" i want to assure you that this will be a very temporary measure that will gradually be relaxed, \" reuters reports. The bbc spoke with the country's finance minister, who said the levy will be \" significant, \" and as high as 40 %.",

Ryan \" played the part of the glib, ambitious student, \" casting the romney-ryan ticket as a \" father-son pairing rather than a team of equals, \" writes molly ball at the atlantic.

        "summary": "A painkiller that cost $ 138 a bottle less than five years ago now hovers at close to $ 3,000 — the latest price hike to put the pharmaceutical industry in the spotlight. Cnnmoney reports horizon pharma's latest increase on vimovo, which has seen nearly a dozen such rate rises since horizon acquired it from astrazeneca in 2013, amounts to a 9.9 % increase on a 60-pill bottle, making the wholesale price $ 2,979. The high cost of the med — which fiercepharma explains is prescribed to help ease symptoms from certain forms of arthritis and to prevent gastric ulcers — is also raising eyebrows because its two main ingredients, naproxen ( sold as the aleve brand ) and esomeprazole ( commonly sold as nexium ), are sold separately for under $ 40. \" based on the mechanism of action of these drugs, i see no reason why these products can't be taken individually, \" the ceo of a company that makes software to help ease drug payments tells the irish times. Horizon pharma disagrees: it says taking the meds separately isn't the same as taking the combo pill; it adds there's no generic or otc version of vimovo. The company also pushes back on the steep price, noting it has rebates that allow all but 2 % of insured patients to get the drug for less than $ 10 out of their own wallet. However, analysts say the price hike ends up raising insurance prices overall. It also underlies the murkiness of what happens when drug prices rise, as no one's really sure who's making money off the deal; besides the manufacturer, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers are also in the mix.

        "summary": "Tondalo hall wasn't accused of abusing her two young children but was handed a 30-year sentence for failing to protect them from her abusive boyfriend. Her partner, meanwhile, nabbed a plea deal and served just two years for breaking the ribs and femur of their 3-month-old infant; he was released in 2006. The 31-year-old hall appealed for clemency to the oklahoma pardon and parole board, but that appeal was denied wednesday, leaving her with at least 15 more years behind bars and frustrating women's rights activists, buzzfeed reports. The board — whose vice chair \" seemed incredulous \" during the hearing that hall hadn't done more to help her kids, buzzfeed notes — offered no explanation for its 5-0 decision against hall, whose plight had received publicity from a buzzfeed investigation last year. In court documents, testimony against hall's boyfriend indicated he choked and punched her regularly, was verbally abusive, and isolated her from family and friends, the washington post notes. In her commutation application, hall — whose sentence ends in 2034, with the possibility of parole in 2030 — acknowledged her past mistakes but says she's since dedicated herself to becoming a better mom, taking parenting and anger management classes and earning her ged. \" despite my failures, i did not physically abuse my children, \" she wrote. \" i was an active parent and a proud mother. I loved and cared for my children and i would appreciate the opportunity to watch them grow up. \" the co-founder of a national advocacy group that got 70,000 signatures on a petition to release hall tells buzzfeed, \" the [ board ] had the responsibility to make things right and they failed with [ wednesday's ] decision. \" read more on her case here.",

Under a new proposal from the chicago mayor, high school students of chicago public schools will need to prove they have a plan for their immediate future before they can graduate, reports the chicago tribune. To fulfill the graduation requirement, students of the class of 2020 and beyond will need to show they have a job offer, or are entering university, community college, a trade program, the military, or another educational program. The goal is to prepare students for a challenging job market, emanuel tells cbs chicago. \" a [ high school ] diploma alone isn't enough anymore, \" says cps chief education officer janice jackson. Emanuel notes all high school graduates in chicago are automatically accepted at city colleges, so no student will be left without an option. But critics say the rule could force undecided students to rush into a decision, or harm students living in poverty, per quartz. Some say it may also require more high school counselors and additional funding for local community colleges, which are struggling financially. Others question if it's even legal for cps to weigh in on students ' choices. \" i've been doing this for 20 years and i've never heard of anything like that, \" says an education policy expert. \" the question i would have for mayor emanuel is: ' where did this come from? what informed your thinking to lead you to believe that this was a good plan of action for cps?

Acid snow is as natural as acid rain in our post-industrial revolution world and it poses an unusual threat. Let's delve into the properties of acid snow, along with its dangerous backlash when spring comes and temperatures rise. The top image is an altered form of an image by day-light on deviantart. How is acidic precipitation created? s normal rain is already somewhat acidic, due to the absorption of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide in the air becomes carbonic acid, a weak acid, leading to a ph of approximately 5.6 for most rainfall across the world. Acid precipitation is created when industrial pollutants like sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide react with water in the atmosphere. Upon reaction with water, nitric acid and sulfuric acid forms, and this decreases the ph of the ensuing precipitation.

            "We grow up hearing about acid rain, but what about other forms of acidic precipitation — do they even exist? one form, acid snow, certainly does exist. Acid snow is as natural as acid rain in our post-industrial revolution world and it poses an unusual threat. Let's delve into the properties of acid snow, along with its dangerous backlash when spring comes and temperatures rise. The top image is an altered form of an image by day-light on deviantart. How is acidic precipitation created? s normal rain is already somewhat acidic, due to the absorption of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide in the air becomes carbonic acid, a weak acid, leading to a ph of approximately 5.6 for most rainfall across the world. Acid precipitation is created when industrial pollutants like sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide react with water in the atmosphere. Upon reaction with water, nitric acid and sulfuric acid forms, and this decreases the ph of the ensuing precipitation. Both sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide are pollutants created in the process of fuel combustion, with nitrogen and sulfur oxide also released through the use of coal to produce electricity. S less acidic than acid rain acid snow is slightly less acidic than acid rain, due to the crystalline structure of ice as it falls. The ph of acid snow ranges",

The new season officially arrives at 12: 30am edt on sunday, march 20, notes the old farmer's almanac. And as earthsky points out, this happens to be the earliest arrival of spring since 1896 — the result of a fluke in the calendar. \" in a nutshell, this earliest spring is happening because the tropical year, as measured between successive march equinoxes, doesn't have an even number of days ( 365.242 days ), \" explains the post. And so leap years ( 366 days ) vs. Non-leap years ( 365 days ) adjust its timing. And pope gregory xiii threw a wrench into things: in 1582 he decreed that leap year not fall on centennial years, unless that year was divisible by four — so 2000 was considered a leap year, but not 1900. That \" causes the march equinox to arrive roughly three-quarters of a day earlier in the 21st century than at corresponding years in the 20th century, \" explains the post. Every four years, the march equinox will shift earlier, ultimately bringing us to the earliest one of the 21st century: 10: 03am march 19, 2096. Come 2100, where there is also no leap year, the march equinox times will be pushed forward, and will once again occur on march 21 in 2102.

Not so, says president trump. \" the story in the new york times concerning north korea developing missile bases is inaccurate, \" he tweeted. \" we fully know about the sites being discussed, nothing new - and nothing happening out of the normal. Just more fake news. I will be the first to let you know if things go bad! \" the times story he's referring to was based on a new study by center for strategic and international studies, whose researchers say they have found more than a dozen secret ballistic missile bases in north korea. The newspaper acknowledges, however, that us intelligence agencies have long known about this network. Here is how the times frames the issue: \" the satellite images suggest that the north has been engaged in a great deception: it has offered to dismantle a major launching site — a step it began, then halted — while continuing to make improvements at more than a dozen others that would bolster launches of conventional and nuclear warheads. \" south korea objected to this characterization even before trump did, also using the phrase \" nothing new. \" a spokesman for president moon jae-in adds: \"north korea has never promised to dismantle its missile bases, nor has it ever joined any treaty that obligates it to dismantle them. So calling this a 'deception ' is not appropriate. \" that didn't stop democratic sen. Ed markey, who sits on the foreign relations panel, from asserting that trump was \" getting played by kim jong un, \" per bloomberg.",

        "summary": "A new study published in the journal of pediatrics found ensuring children under 15 are properly restrained — or wearing seat belts at all — could save about 232 lives every year. Researchers found 20 % of children who died in fatal car crashes between 2010 and 2014 weren't buckled in or were improperly restrained, npr reports. Of the more than 18,000 children involved in fatal car crashes in those years, 15.9 % died. The biggest factor in those deaths was whether the children were properly restrained. Other factors included rural roads, which increased the likelihood a child would die in a car crash, and red light cameras, which decreased that likelihood. The study found child fatality rates varied widely by state, which makes sense as seat belt laws, public information on car seats, rural roads, and the use of red light cameras also vary widely by state. More than half of all children who died in a car crash lived in the south. The highest rates of death were in mississippi, wyoming, alabama, montana, and virginia, cbs news reports. The lowest were in massachusetts, new york, new jersey, washington, and rhode island. In mississippi, 38 % of children who died in a fatal car crash weren't restrained properly or at all. The study's authors advocate for stronger seat belt laws and better public information — potentially at the federal level — to protect children in car crashes.",

The wall street journal reports that supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei sent obama a letter \" in recent weeks \" whose tone it describes as \" respectful but noncommittal. \" it was in response to a letter obama wrote in october suggesting cooperation between the two countries in fighting the islamic state if a nuclear deal were struck. As to whether the exchange might lead to an actual deal, well that part's a little hazy. But the journal also provides the first details on an earlier exchange of letters between the two leaders early in obama's tenure, in which khamenei laid out a set of grievances and, significantly, did not rule out the idea of a compromise in nuclear talks. Analysts see the very fact of their existence almost as more important than the details they contain. \"you don't know how important it is for the supreme leader of iran to actually write a letter to the us, \" says a former us official. \"it's a sign he recognizes the country. \" a post at al jazeera america parses recent public comments from obama and khamenei, along with other diplomatic moves, and concludes that \" the two sides are closing in on a deal. \"",

At least 48 people were killed and more than 100 others injured in shootings and bombings, including a triple suicide bombing in the normally peaceful province of nimruz, which borders iran. Bombers there targeted a bazaar bustling with people buying treats for the end-of-ramadan holiday this weekend, and then attacked a hospital where the injured from the first blast where being treated and where worried relatives had gathered, reports the los angeles times. This morning, at least nine people were injured in a mosque in eastern afghanistan when grenades were thrown inside during morning prayers. The attacks are seen as a taliban show of force and an attempt to weaken the country's security forces, who will take control across the country in 28 months as nato departs.

The new york times relays this anecdote from 1964, when a new british band called the rolling stones covered a song he wrote called \" it's all over now. \" at first womack was ticked because he and his brothers had their own version out on the r&b charts as the valentinos.

        "summary": "The american e-cigarette business is booming: it's expected to make more than $ 1 billion this year, and sales are projected to overtake those of real cigarettes by 2047. Big tobacco is probably fine with this, reports businessweek, and the reason why is surprising. According to a recent report, an average of 11 % of cigarettes sold in each us state are smuggled in, and that figure is way higher in states like new york ( 61 % ), arizona ( 54 % ), and new mexico ( 53 % ). \" smuggled \" smokes can be anything from those brought in from other states with lower taxes to counterfeit cigarettes — which are sometimes stuffed with sawdust and \" human excrement. \" \" once a tax gets too high, it acts in the same way that prohibition did: you get substantial black-market activity, \" says an economist. E-cigs, on the other hand, are only subject to regular sales taxes, so the black market incentive isn't there. Tobacco giants are now moving their focus to the e-cig market and launching products of their own. Of course, now the fda is looking to start regulating the industry, as the wall street journal reports. But bans on online sales or advertising restrictions probably won't bother them that much, the businessweek report suggests — so long as they're not hit with taxes.",

Investigators think the petite 25-year-old mother was abducted, and family members believe she was lured away from the exxon mobil in norton shores by an acquaintance or someone saying they needed help. A few odd details from the local police chief would seem to fit that theory: \" there's no sign of a struggle, no sign of anything inside the store being disturbed. The cash drawer was sitting out and no money was missing. Her purse was in the store with 400-some dollars in it. It's just odd how that occurred. \" friends say customers at the gas station are regular, and they also believe heeringa knew or at least recognized her abductor, fox 17 reports. Heeringa's disappearance was discovered after customers found the gas station open but empty and called police. There's scant evidence to work with, as the station had no security camera; right now, police are looking for a gray or silver minivan seen in the area and its driver, a white man aged 30 to 40, around six feet tall with wavy, light brown hair.

Interior secretary sally jewell announced on thursday that the louisiana black bear — which appeared in the famous \" teddy's bear \" political cartoon after teddy roosevelt refused to shoot a tied-up one in 1902 — has been taken off both the threatened and endangered species list after a population increase from as few as 80 in 1959 to up to 750 today, the christian science monitor reports. In what authorities say should serve as an example to other areas, the bear rebounded with the help of habitat restoration and wildlife corridors that connected different populations of the bear subspecies, which once ranged all the way from eastern texas to eastern mississippi. Jewell praised the \" recovery of a species, \" though the ap notes that some groups think the move is premature. \" the work's not over, \" jewell told reporters. \" the work's really just beginning to bring back more of these hardwoods so louisiana can help enjoy the kinds of animals that teddy roosevelt saw when he was here at the turn of the century. \" there hasn't been a legal bear hunt in the state since 1988, and the new orleans advocate reports that state authorities, who will now take over work to protect the species, say it's far too early to talk about holding one now.

With no sound save the murmur of voices and the faraway cry of her fans, the clip shows vonn as she prepares for this moment, slapping her thighs, stretching and bouncing, blowing out her cheeks, taking small but fierce breaths. Then she was off, a tiny figure against an impossibly wide and steep slope, and there was no need for a commentator's opinion about speed or form, her past performances or her injured shin.

Lindy chamberlain-creighton was found guilty of murder in 1982 and sentenced to life in prison; that conviction was later overturned after a piece of azaria's clothing was found near a dingo den, notes the afp; the child's body was never found. The australian reports that the case is being reopened because new information about recent dingo attacks was given to the northern territory coroner by the chamberlains ' lawyers. Among the included incidents, as noted by the telegraph: a 9-year-old boy was mauled to death in 2001 by two dingoes, and a four-year-old girl was harmed in 2007. The new inquest will begin on feb. 24.",

Northern territory coroner elizabeth morris has cited new information from the chamberlains ' counsel about dingo attacks as a reason for reopening the inquiry, the sun-herald newspaper said on sunday. Azaria was just nine weeks old when she went missing on august 17, 1980 during a camping trip to ayers rock, or uluru, the evocative red monolith in the heart of australia's outback. Her body was never found. The case inspired the 1988 hit film \" a cry in the dark \", starring meryl streep and sam neill, along with books, a tv mini-series and even an opera, and was followed closely",
            "In a case that divided the nation and inspired the film a cry in the dark, the baby's mother, lindy chamberlain, was convicted and jailed for life after a jury refused to believe her claim that a dingo stole her baby from a tent near uluru, or ayers rock, in 1980. However, the conviction prompted a community campaign and was overturned in 1988 following a royal commission. But the cause of death has remained open. In a surprising twist, the northern territory coroner agreed to open a new inquest after the chamberlains presented information about \" dingo attacks since the death of azaria \".

            "New australian inquest into'dingo ' baby death sydney — a new inquest will be opened into the death of baby azaria chamberlain, according to reports, 31 years after she was apparently taken by a dingo at ayers rock in a case that caused a worldwide sensation. Northern territory coroner elizabeth morris has cited new information from the chamberlains ' counsel about dingo attacks as a reason for reopening the inquiry, the sun-herald newspaper said on sunday. Azaria was just nine weeks old when she went missing on august 17, 1980 during a camping trip to ayers rock, or uluru, the evocative red monolith in the heart of australia's outback. Her body was never found. The case inspired the 1988 hit film \" a cry in the dark \", starring meryl streep and sam neill, along with books, a tv mini-series and even an opera, and was followed closely",
            "In a case that divided the nation and inspired the film a cry in the dark, the baby's mother, lindy chamberlain, was convicted and jailed for life after a jury refused to believe her claim that a dingo stole her baby from a tent near uluru, or ayers rock, in 1980. However, the conviction prompted a community campaign and was overturned in 1988 following a royal commission. But the cause of death has remained open. In a surprising twist, the northern territory coroner agreed to open a new inquest after the chamberlains presented information about \" dingo attacks since the death of azaria \". The information reportedly includes an account of attacks by dingoes on children at fraser island in queensland, including an incident in 2001 in which two dingoes mauled a 9-year-old boy to death. In another incident in 2007, a four-year-old girl was badly injured after she was bitten",

They are accused of raping a drunk female midshipman during an off-campus party last year, reports the new york times, which has interviewed the unidentified woman. The 21-year-old says she was drunk before she arrived at the party and continued drinking while there. She acknowledges that she doesn't remember much, apart from being on a bed with one player on the team and later in a car with three others. \"i was sitting on my knees on the floor in the back seat, \" she tells the times. \"i remember briefly seeing them, and i remember crying, and being upset and saying i ' m sorry. \" a day later, when she noticed bruises on her body, she says one of the players admitted they had sex with her. Soon, rumors started flying around campus on social media — including a private facebook page for players — and the woman went to authorities when she heard another female cadet was going to report the incident. No charges have been filed, but the graduation of one of the suspects has been delayed while the investigation continues. The three were allowed to play this season.",

It used to be \" a working class coalition of urban workers and rural farmers \" until it developed a \" new left ethos — turning decidedly leftward not only from cultural conservatism but also on middle class, quality of life issues ( feminism, environmentalism, consumer rights, etc ) that are of much more concern to ' enlightened ' liberals in the big cities than rural voters in arkansas. \" steve kornacki, salon: chalking it up entirely to race \" may be an oversimplification, \" although he notes that obama fared miserably in the region in 2008 against hillary clinton. \" perhaps obama's race is one of several markers ( along with his name, his background, and the never-ending muslim rumors, his status as the ' liberal ' candidate in 2008 ) that low-income white rural voters use to associate him with a national democratic party that they believe has been overrun by affluent liberals, feminists, minorities, secularists and gays — people and groups whose interests are being serviced at the expense of their own. \"",

        "summary": "Researchers are pushing for banner ads that offer free hiv test kits to gay men on the dating and hookup site grindr after a ucla and indiana university study. Results from the study, reported in the journal sexual health, suggest that greater access to free testing will improve rates of testing. The team says that after posting 300,000 banners ads and three broadcast messages targeting a high-risk hiv population in los angeles in the fall of 2014, 333 tests were requested, 56 men took them and filled out questionnaires, and two men ultimately learned that they were hiv positive. Engadget notes that given 5 million men in 192 countries use grindr, the simple step could be a \" very effective \" means of slowing the spread of hiv. Paper author dr. Jeffrey d. Klausner, an hiv specialist at ucla's school of medicine, tells the new york times that using the app to encourage home testing is \" ripe for expansion \" in other cities and possibly countries. He says they used grindr because it's the \" oldest and biggest \" gay dating app, and they focused on black and hispanic men who have sex with men because they are four times more likely than their white counterparts to not know they are hiv positive. Recipients received test kits in the mail, via a pharmacy voucher, or via a code that produced a vending machine kit at the los angeles gay and lesbian center. The test relies on a simple swab of the gums and results are available in 20 minutes. ( the cdc predicts that one in two gay black men alive today will become hiv positive in their lifetime. )",

The results showed a bunch of differences in how dads interact with sons versus daughters. Dads sang more to daughters and talked more about sadness with them, according to live science. Dads spent three times longer playing with sons than daughters. And dads of daughters talked more about their child's body, whereas dads of sons used more words like \" win \" and \" best. \" researchers also gave the dads mri brain scans while they looked at photos of their children. Dads of daughters had bigger reactions to their child looking happy; dads of sons had bigger responses to their child looking neutral. Researchers say it shows dads may pay less attention to their sons ' emotional needs. But alan kazdin tells cbs news we shouldn't draw conclusions from the small study. For one thing, the professor of child psychiatry says it's unclear whether dads treat sons and daughters differently for societal reasons or if they're responding to differences in behavior between boys and girls.

Why does it happen every time? well, there's actually a whole branch of science to help explain, and it's called knot theory, wired reports. A 2007 experiment conducted at the university of california, san diego, may shed some light on the situation. Researchers dropped string into a motorized spinning box, examining the resulting knots. They argued that knots occurred because when a string is coiled in order to fit in a small space, its end is parallel to other sections. Spinning makes it possible for that end to loop around a segment, and more spinning means more looping. In half of the 10-second spins, strings came out knotted. The longer a string was, the higher the chance of knotting — up to a point. Strings shorter than a foot-and-a-half didn't usually get knotted, and those beyond five feet long got knotty just half the time. So how to avoid knots? stiffer cables help reduce tangling, as do smaller spaces. Or you can try a do-it-yourself method to avoid tangling.",

        "summary": "Your dog really may be your best friend, according to a new study out of japan that highlights just how far canine loyalty can go. In a study to be published later this month in the journal animal behaviour, cognitive researchers at kyoto university found that dogs will actually ignore people who snub their owners, even when food is being offered. It's a level of social cooperation seen so rarely in the animal kingdom that even among primates it's not exactly common, reports afp. \" this ability is one of [ the ] key factors in building a highly collaborative society, and this study shows that dogs share that ability with humans, \" lead researcher kazuo fujita said. The team tested three groups of 18 dogs — using breeds including golden retrievers and chihuahuas, and a range of ages, from seven months to 14 years, reports quartz — who watched their owners try to open a box. Two strangers were always present. In the first group, the owner asked one stranger for help but was refused while the other remained neutral; in the second, the person being asked did help while the other remained neutral; and in the third control group, neither of the strangers interacted with the owner at all. Then in all instances, the strangers offered the dogs food. The dogs turned out to be willing to take food from anyone — except, of course, the strangers who refused to help with the box. Would your best friend have your back like that? ( there's also evidence that dogs are cunning thieves. )",

            "Tokyo ( afp ) - dogs do not like people who are mean to their owners, japanese researchers said friday, and will refuse food offered by people who have snubbed their master. The findings reveal that canines have the capacity to co-operate socially -- a characteristic found in a relatively small number of species, including humans and some other primates. Researchers led by kazuo fujita, a professor of comparative cognition at kyoto university, tested three groups of 18 dogs using role plays in which their owners needed to open a box. In all three groups, the owner was accompanied by two people whom the dog did not know. In the first group, the owner sought assistance from one of the other people, who actively refused to help. In the second group, the owner asked for, and received, help from one person. In both groups, the third person was neutral and not involved in either helping or refusing to help.
