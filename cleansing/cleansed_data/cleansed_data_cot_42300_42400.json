A 10-mile stretch of interstate 405 had to be closed over the weekend so part of the 50-year-old mulholland drive bridge could be taken down to make way for a wider road. While the crew was working on one section of the span, another section plummeted to the earth, reports cnn. But no one was injured, and la mayor antonio villaraigosa has already labeled the work a \" resounding \" success. \" our hope and expectation was that it would be carmaheaven 2, \" boasted villaraigosa. The highway has already reopened today ahead of schedule, but it hasn't been easy street beating the rush-hour deadline as crews scrambled to squeeze into two days what should have taken weeks, filling potholes and paving three southbound lanes along sepulveda pass. \" this was the mother of all public works projects, \" a los angeles county supervisor grumbled to the los angeles times. The work is part of a $ 1 billion, four-year project to install what villaraigosa calls the \" longest carpool lane in the nation. \"",

        "summary": "Ukraine's economy is in crisis, which makes the stories emerging about former president viktor yanukovich's water-feature-filled estate stand out all the more. Two main narratives, about what was found in the water, and what else was on the property: foreign policy on saturday reported on what protesters found in the water after getting to mezhyhirya, yanukovich's luxe home some 12 miles outside of kiev: files thrown into what it terms a river ( the wire calls it a moat; ap says it was a lake ), ostensibly by the last man out the door. The files, which journalists are in the process of drying via heat gun, include dossiers on journalists and activists, accounting files, and receipts, including one dated september 2010, the year yanukovich took office, that records a $ 12 million cash transfer; it doesn't specify the parties on the giving or receiving ends. The estate was formerly state-owned, but yanukovich \" privatized \" it, and the ap reports that the found files shine a light on what was spent making that happen. Outfitting the \" knight's hall \" with curtains cost $ 110,000; $ 1.5 million went to the purchase of plants; $ 2.3 million went to wooden decor for rooms including the \" tea room. \" as for what else ukrainians found after descending on it on saturday makes for a roster of luxuries almost too long to list. Highlights, from the global post: a pirate galleon anchored on a man-made lake, a golf course, a large vintage car collection, a bar stocked with vodka bottles bearing yanukovich's face, faux ruins, a boxing ring, a private zoo complete with ostriches, and a church. The ap points out that yanukovich formerly only described the estate as a modest house on a small plot of land. Click through the gallery for more pictures of the estate, or the bbc has more here.",

        "summary": "After years of intrigue, researchers are celebrating \" a major step forward \" for the male birth control pill. A month-long clinical trial shows a once-daily male pill is safe and effective at suppressing the hormones needed for sperm production, and has no negative effect on sex drive, according to researchers who presented their findings sunday at the endocrine society's annual conference in chicago, per the telegraph. The hormone pill, dimethandrolone undecanoate ( dmau ), overcomes issues that plagued earlier versions of the male contraceptive. In addition to concerns about how low testosterone would affect sex drive, researchers feared the pill would need to be taken twice daily, given the speed that hormones clear the male body, reports the guardian. Dmau, however, contains fatty acid undecanoate which is believed to slow the clearance. Some 100 men aged 18 to 50 received a placebo or varying doses ( 100mg, 200mg, or 400mg ) of the pill, which contains an androgen and a progestin and must be taken with food. After 28 days, all pill-popping patients saw low testosterone levels, while patients given the 400mg dose saw a \" marked suppression \" in testosterone and two other hormones needed for sperm production, reports the telegraph. Patients also saw mild weight gain and a slight drop in hdl or \" good cholesterol \" levels, per nbc news. But \" very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess, \" and liver and kidney function remained healthy, senior researcher stephanie page says in a release. \" these promising results are unprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill. \" research will now focus on effects over longer periods. ( another male pill might leave hormones alone. )",

Hemler, now 49, says he deserted at the age of 21 after getting involved with a pacifist church and becoming disillusioned with ronald reagan's policies. He is married to a swedish citizen and has three children. His family in pennsylvania had assumed he was dead until they heard from him a few weeks ago.

A spokeswoman for the air force office of special investigations says hemler contacted the agency about 10 days ago. \" we really want to catch this guy, \" she tells the new york times. It's not clear what punishment hemler will face for deserting — or whether the swedes will be willing to hand him over. \" my dream scenario is that the responsible authorities realize i have already been punished quite severely for my actions, \" he says. \" i have been living 28 years in lies. \"",

Under an alias, he married and fathered three children and worked at a hamburger restaurant and a nursing home before finding a job with the swedish government. Before that, though, he was an airman who had enlisted straight out of high school and joined the united states air force's 6913th electronic security squadron based in augsburg, germany. But on feb. 10, 1984, distraught over a broken relationship and angered by the foreign policies of president ronald reagan, mr. Hemler, then 21, deserted and hitchhiked to sweden. Until a month ago his family had presumed he was dead. \"i never planned on it being this long, \" mr. Hemler said by telephone from uppsala, the university town where he has lived for nearly three decades. \"days went and weeks, and i started to realize that maybe the military police weren't coming. I just felt so good. I had a delayed teenage rebellion, you could say. \" this month, mr.

I intended to come to sweden until i felt better ( after his experience in the airforce ), i expected a week or so, \" hemler told the newspaper in a video on its website.

            "For 28 years, david a. Hemler said sunday, he has lived a secret, though rather mundane life in sweden, far from his native pennsylvania. Under an alias, he married and fathered three children and worked at a hamburger restaurant and a nursing home before finding a job with the swedish government. Before that, though, he was an airman who had enlisted straight out of high school and joined the united states air force's 6913th electronic security squadron based in augsburg, germany. But on feb. 10, 1984, distraught over a broken relationship and angered by the foreign policies of president ronald reagan, mr. Hemler, then 21, deserted and hitchhiked to sweden. Until a month ago his family had presumed he was dead. \"i never planned on it being this long, \" mr. Hemler said by telephone from uppsala, the university town where he has lived for nearly three decades. \"days went and weeks, and i started to realize that maybe the military police weren't coming. I just felt so good. I had a delayed teenage rebellion, you could say. \" this month, mr. Hemler, 49, who was born in cleona, pa., said he decided it was time to call the family he had left behind, first telling his story to the swedish newspaper dagens nyheter.",

Air force deserter who has lived secretly in sweden since 1984 has revealed his identity and contacted his family in the united states who were overwhelmed to hear he was still alive, a swedish newspaper reported at the weekend. Dagens nyheter said david hemler had deserted aged 21 while serving at a u.s. Air force base in germany, after getting involved with a pacifist church and becoming disillusioned with the policies of former president ronald reagan. He hitchhiked via denmark to sweden where he settled down, living under an assumed name for the last 28 years and not revealing his true identity to anyone. \" i never planned on not telling the truth in the beginning. I intended to come to sweden until i felt better ( after his experience in the airforce ), i expected a week or so, \" hemler told the newspaper in a video on its website. Now aged 49, he is married to a woman from thailand, has three children and works for a swedish government agency, but would not let the newspaper print his assumed name. After his desertion, he became one of the u.s. Air force's eight most wanted fugitives, according to the newspaper, and had expected at any time to be arrested by military police with both interpol and europol looking for him. Hemler told"

What is clear is that the brothers were in the midst of a rift that the scandal would only expose. According to the los angeles times, the brothers with a reputation for noisy spats had for years pursued their own interests at the weinstein company — bob favoring commercial flicks, harvey preferring high-brow films — when harvey reportedly punched bob during a meeting six years ago. \" i divorced my brother five years ago \" and since then, \" i've probably talked to my brother 10 times on any personal level, \" bob weinstein tells the hollywood reporter. \" i could not take being around him. \" in 2015, it was bob weinstein who alerted the weinstein company's board of directors to a sexual harassment allegation made against his brother by a female employee, the times reports. Publicly, however, the brothers played nice to appease their mother, sources say. Upon her death last year at age 90, outright war was no longer out of the question. But if bob weinstein intended to take full control over the company he built with his brother, he might've been overconfident. Now facing his own allegations of harassment and bullying, he may only hold onto his offshoot label dimension films. There's also the possibility he could start a new label, but that may be a challenge without his brazen brother leading the charge, reports nbc news.",

In her lengthy and passionate dissent, sotomayor countered that this was a matter of equal protection of the law, and hence the court should intervene. \" democratically approved legislation can oppress minority groups, \" she wrote.

Bloomberg notes the suit \" might seem strange, \" as phone messaging apps are now \" ubiquitous \" and share many of the same features. A blackberry rep tells reuters the suit came only after longtime negotiations and because the company owed it to shareholders to protect its technology. Cheddar reporter alex heath, who initially said blackberry's suit felt \" desperate and completely out of left field, \" tweeted out a statement tuesday from facebook, which notes \" blackberry's suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business.

Analyzing data from more than 17,000 healthy people aged 50 and older collected in an online trial, researchers at the university of exeter medical school and kings college london announced that when it comes to tests on short-term memory and grammatical reasoning speed, people who play word puzzles enjoy cognitive health that is equivalent to 10 years younger than their actual age. That performance was not only consistently better in people who engage in puzzles, but actually improved incrementally with the frequency of puzzle play. It's an exciting enough finding, per fast company, that researchers now want to conduct a clinical trial to see if playing crosswords and other word puzzles can actively help reduce cognitive decline. \" we can't yet say that crosswords give you a sharper brain — the next step is to assess whether encouraging people to start playing word games regularly could actually improve their brain function, \" one researcher says in a press release.

Police say a man is being questioned in topeka after allegedly phoning in a threat against the kansas... ( associated press ) capitol police spokesman patrick saleh said the incident was not connected to another arrest wednesday of a man who allegedly phoned in a threat to gov. Sam brownback's office from a topeka motel. \" neither one of them was armed, and neither of them offered any resistance, \" saleh said. Saleh said officers went to investigate the pickup after receiving a call from a state employee about it being parked in a restricted lot outside the kansas judicial center, south of the statehouse, without the normal state worker tag. An officer saw suspicious objects inside, including an empty gun holster, and authorities called in the topeka police department's bomb squad. Saleh said the homemade explosives were made with household materials and designed to spray shrapnel once they were detonated. He didn't have further details, but called them \" actual explosives.",

The trucks discovery was the first in a day of unusual events at the statehouse that included threats made to the governors office and hundreds gathering on the steps of the capitol to protest policies advocated by gov. Sam brownback and secretary of state kris kobach. Authorities detained a suspect driving the truck. They also arrested a columbia, mo., man and charged him with making harassing calls to the governors office. Patrick saleh, spokesman for the capitol police, said the three events were unrelated. everything seems to be independent of each other. It just occurred on the same day by happenstance,  saleh said. The most potentially threatening situation was discovered by a state worker who was upset about where an unpermitted truck with a florida plate was parked. The truck was parked in state lot no. 1 next to the kansas judicial center, which houses the state supreme court and the court of appeals. Police responded to the complaint and saw an empty holster inside. The black ford pickup was dotted with decals including one with uncle sam that read: welcome to america.

Samsung revealed the phone today at an event at new york's radio city music hall. The galaxy s4, which crams a 5-inch screen into body slightly smaller than the s3's, will go on sale globally between april and june. In the us, it will be sold by all four national carriers — verizon wireless, at&t, sprint nextel, and t-mobile usa — as well as by smaller ones us cellular and cricket. Samsung didn't say what the phone will cost, but it can be expected to start at $ 200 with a two-year contract in the us. In the last two years, samsung has emerged as apple's main competitor in the high-end smartphone market. At the same time, it has sold enough inexpensive low-end phones to edge out nokia as the world's largest maker of phones. Early reviews are mixed. It \" feels uninspired, \" writes brent rose at gizmodo. \" there are small spec bumps from the previous generation and there's a ton of software which will largely sit unused. There's just no wow-factor here. \" but at techcrunch, jordan crook writes that \" it very well may be the best smartphone on the market, period. \"",

The latter is true of a bizarre incident in stockholm involving three chinese tourists — an older couple and their grown son, reports the guardian. The three arrived very early, apparently the night before their scheduled check-in at a facility described variously as a hostel or a hotel. The two sides differ on exactly what happened next — the hotel says the tourists became belligerent and threatened staff, while the son says he merely wanted the hotel to allow his elderly parents to wait in the lobby — but the upshot is that police came and carried the group outside. See them lying on the sidewalk here. \"this is killing, this is killing, \" the son yells in english. \" save me, \" says his mother. The video soon took off on social media platforms in china, with many users outraged at the treatment. Others thought the family embarrassed china. Beijing's foreign ministry sided with the former camp, and a spokesman at china's embassy in sweden said police \" severely endangered the life and violated the basic human rights of the chinese citizens. \" a state newspaper, the people's daily, has accused sweden of being hypocritical in calling out human rights issues elsewhere, notes reuters. So far, swedish government officials haven't deemed the incident worthy of an investigation, with one anonymous official accusing china of exaggerating things because sweden recently spoke out against the detention of a swedish citizen, gui minhai, in china.

            "Beijing demands an apology over 'brutal abuse ' of three chinese tourists by police in stockholm a disagreement between chinese tourists and a hostel in stockholm over check-in time has turned into a diplomatic spat between china and sweden, after beijing criticised sweden for violating the human rights of chinese citizens. China has demanded an apology from sweden and issued a safety alert for its tourists in the country after it said that three tourists had been \"brutally abused \" by swedish police on 2 september. The zengs, a family of three, had arrived at a hostel in stockholm around midnight, hours before their booking. They were allowed to wait in the lobby until the staff ordered them to leave and police forcibly ejected them. Bizarre video footage posted online shows police carrying the group outside, while the son yells in english: \"this is killing. This is killing. \" another clip shows the three lying on the ground crying loudly while the mother wails in chinese: \"save me. \" the chinese embassy in sweden said on saturday that china's ministry of foreign affairs and the embassy had \"made solemn representations \" to the swedish government \"stressing that what the police had done severely endangered the life and violated the basic human rights of the chinese citizens. \" the incident comes as ties between china",

Police forcibly ejected a chinese man surnamed zeng and his parents from a hotel in stockholm in the early hours of sept. 2 after they arrived a day before their booking and were asked to leave, according to chinese state media.

China has demanded an apology from sweden and issued a safety alert for its tourists in the country after it said that three tourists had been \"brutally abused \" by swedish police on 2 september. The zengs, a family of three, had arrived at a hostel in stockholm around midnight, hours before their booking. They were allowed to wait in the lobby until the staff ordered them to leave and police forcibly ejected them. Bizarre video footage posted online shows police carrying the group outside, while the son yells in english: \"this is killing.

What health officials are worried may help along the outbreak, so far mainly concentrated in hennepin county: a fear among local somali-americans that the measles vaccine causes autism. Measles was declared eradicated in the us in 2000, but it's still brought into the country by travelers, spurring recent outbreaks. The current situation a tinderbox, per kris ehresmann, the director of the infectious disease unit of the state's health department, because measles is such a highly contagious disease that its presence in a community that often lives in congested quarters and fears the vaccine is a recipe for disaster. Ehresmann says health officials are trying their best to step up outreach efforts, which includes sending representatives to appear on somali tv and radio and in chatrooms, as well as involving local imams in the conversation. What may also help spread the word: community members who've come around to the health officials ' way of seeing things. A young somali mother in minneapolis profiled in the washington post explains how her two young children got measles this spring, her 18-month-old hospitalized for four nights — and how she now plans to encourage others to get the vaccine, especially those who attend local anti-vax meetings. \" because when the kids get sick, it's going to affect everybody, \" she notes.

The cause is actually straightforward: baby dominique ( her last name isn't being released ) was developing in utero with a twin, but as sometimes happens, she absorbed her twin's body. Well, most of it. The legs, feet, and spine of the so-called \" parasitic twin \" who required dominique's organs to survive fused to dominique's spine. They would eventually not only prove cumbersome but also tax her heart and shorten her life, reports the bbc. \" that amount of mass and disturbance in that area would cause her significant spinal problems as she grew, \" one surgeon said. Five surgeons spent six hours using an \" enormous \" amount of specialized imaging to remove the twin's anatomy ( including bones, blood vessels, and nerves, reports the chicago tribune ) from dominique's spine — a risky operation that could have resulted in paralysis. The team at advocate children's hospital in park ridge, ill., tells reuters the operation was a success and that the 10-month-old is thriving at her chicago area foster home. \" she has touched our hearts, \" her foster mother nancy swabb said, holding back tears as she called the \" amazing \" girl \" resilient. \" dominique will be reunited with her parents and three older sisters, who are regularly updated with photos and stories, as soon as she can travel.

        "summary": "It's being called a \" bombshell \" in the making a murderer case. Rolling stone reports steven avery's defense lawyer claims to have evidence that a different member of avery's extended family is implicated in the 2005 murder of teresa halbach. Kathleen zellner filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing monday in wisconsin \"based on manifest errors of law and fact and the development of new evidence \" after a judge refused to grant avery a new trial earlier this month, according to wbay. Much of the new evidence claimed by zellner's court filing has to do with bobby dassey, avery's nephew and older brother of brendan dassey, who along with avery was sentenced to life in prison for halbach's murder. The hit netflix series made a case that avery and brendan dassey were framed; zellner's filing suggests bobby dassey could have been part of that, newsweek reports. Bobby dassey was the one who testified that he last saw halbach walking toward avery's trailer and never saw her leave the property. Zellner's filing states that a week after halbach's murder, another brother, bryan dassey, was told by bobby that he did see halbach leave the property. Bryan signed an affidavit to that effect but nothing was done with that evidence. The court filing also claims the dassey family computer contained \" images of ms. Halbach, many images of violent pornography involving young females being raped and tortured, and images of injuries to females. \" it claims those images were accessed at times only bobby dassey was home. The court filing also claims new evidence connecting halbach's ex-boyfriend to the crime scene and more. Zellner tells newsweek \" our efforts to win mr. Avery's freedom will never stop. \"",

Jackie says she eventually reported the case to the school's sexual misconduct board, but not to police, and the allegations went nowhere. The story has set off a ruckus on campus, reports the local daily progress. Hundreds of students rallied yesterday against sexual violence, and vandals broke windows at the phi kappa psi frat house. The frat has surrendered its school charter and stopped all activities, and uva has appointed a former us deputy attorney general to review how it handles sexual assaults. Erdely notes that she hadn't talked to jackie as of yesterday afternoon, and wasn't sure if she was ready to talk to police. Full article here.",

Saturday, when a hole developed in the main spillway, was the first time the emergency spillway was used since the dam was completed in 1968. Authorities say the dam itself remains structurally sound, reports the los angeles times. Officials said sunday night that the immediate danger was subsiding because the level of the man-made lake oroville had dropped below the level of the emergency spillway for the first time in more than 24 hours, the sacramento bee reports. But authorities warned that the danger of catastrophic flooding remains, with the main spillway still in danger of collapse because water was released so quickly along it to relieve pressure on the auxiliary spillway, causing further erosion. The ap reports that the evacuation order covered 188,000 people in yuba, sutter and butte counties and that people were stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic out of the area more than five hours after the order was issued.",

During a press conference friday, zervos said that after she rebuffed trump's advances, her job offer was cut in half then rescinded entirely. Earlier, kristin anderson told her story to the washington post: she was at a manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s when trump sat next to her on a couch and groped her, touching her inner thigh and vagina through her underwear and underneath her skirt, she says. At the time, she was trying to get into the modeling industry. \" it wasn't a sexual come-on. I don't know why he did it.

It was very random, very nonchalant on his part. \" she and her friends came to the conclusion that, \" ok, donald is gross. We all know he's gross. Let's just move on, \" she says. The incident lasted half a minute or less before she pushed his hand away and got off the couch. Anderson, now 46, has told the story to friends over the years, and a person who had heard the story contacted the post to get in touch with anderson, but she did not decide to go public with her story until after the 2005 video in which trump can be heard bragging about grabbing women \" by the p --- y \" was leaked.

From 1970 to 2010, the probability that a 15-year-old would die before turning 60 dropped by 19 % for men and 34 % for women, according to christopher murray, md, director of the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington in seattle, and colleagues. During that period, the difference between mortality risk in men and women grew from 63 per 1,000 to 80 per 1,000, the researchers reported online in the lancet. \" i think the widening gap between males and females is brought about to a large extent by the bigger impact of the soviet union collapse -- social dysfunction, high alcohol use -- on males than females, \" murray told medpage today. Also contributing is the hiv epidemic's disproportionate effect on males in certain parts of the world, he said. Murray and his colleagues set out to evaluate worldwide trends in premature adult mortality from 1970 to the present, a topic that has not received as much attention as child health.

            "By todd neale, staff writer, medpage today published: april 29, 2010 although worldwide adult mortality rates have been dropping overall for the past four decades, the gap between men and women, who have lower mortality risk, has widened, researchers found. From 1970 to 2010, the probability that a 15-year-old would die before turning 60 dropped by 19 % for men and 34 % for women, according to christopher murray, md, director of the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington in seattle, and colleagues. During that period, the difference between mortality risk in men and women grew from 63 per 1,000 to 80 per 1,000, the researchers reported online in the lancet. \" i think the widening gap between males and females is brought about to a large extent by the bigger impact of the soviet union collapse -- social dysfunction, high alcohol use -- on males than females, \" murray told medpage today. Also contributing is the hiv epidemic's disproportionate effect on males in certain parts of the world, he said. Murray and his colleagues set out to evaluate worldwide trends in premature adult mortality from 1970 to the present, a topic that has not received as much attention as child health. They argued, however, that \" the prevention of premature adult death is just as",

        "summary": "At an apparent turning point in one of its hardest foreign policy challenges, the trump administration is demanding a ceasefire and the launch of un-led political talks to end the saudi-iran proxy war in yemen. Defense secretary jim mattis called for a halt to hostilities within 30 days. The renewed diplomatic drive reflects a convergence of political pressures: international outrage over the slaying of a us-based saudi journalist and a yemeni humanitarian crisis fueled by the dual threats of war and hunger in the arab world's poorest country, the ap reports. \" the time is now for a cessation of hostilities, \" secretary of state mike pompeo said in a statement late tuesday. The conflict, which began in 2014, has killed around 10,000 people and left more than 8 million at risk of starvation. The administration's new push comes amid mounting fears of a fresh arab coalition assault on the red sea port of hodeida, the entry point for 70 % of food imports and international aid to yemen. Pompeo urged a cease-fire between the saudi-led coalition allied with the government and shiite muslim houthi rebels, citing both missile and drone strikes into saudi arabia and the united arab emirates by houthis and the airstrikes \" in all populated areas \" of yemen by the us-backed arab coalition. He urged implementation of \" confidence-building measures \" to address the underlying issues of the conflict. The united kingdom joined calls for a ceasefire wednesday, the new york times reports. ( un investigators say all parties in the conflict have committed atrocities. )",

It's such a strange assortment of features that researchers who identified the new species from a fossil used x-rays to make sure the nearly complete skeleton wasn't a jumble of unrelated bones. \" it looked like an alien, \" vincent fernandez, co-author of a new nature study, tells the new york times. \" it's like a mixture of things that could have been put together. \" that was a legitimate concern, as the 75-million-year-old fossil found in southern mongolia was sold on the black market before an international team of researchers got their hands on it. They say the fossil is indeed real and identify the creature as halszkaraptor escuilliei, a relative of the velociraptor and perhaps only the second swimming dinosaur ever found. Researchers explain h. Escuilliei's snout, similar to that of a goose, had sensory nerves like those crocodiles use to detect movement in water. The dinosaur's hooked teeth and long neck also would've helped it snatch fish from the surface of lakes and rivers it navigated with flipper-like forelimbs. The long digits of its non-webbed feet may have helped it swim, too, though researchers say the dinosaur likely would've laid its eggs on land, per national geographic. The fossil — explore a virtual 3d image at live science — is now in belgium but will be returned to mongolia. For researchers, it represents all of the surprising dinosaur discoveries still to be made.

Helping his chances was republican rep. Shelley moore capito's capture of the west virginia seat of retiring democratic sen. Jay rockefeller.

Kentucky democrats once had high hopes for challenger alison lundergan grimes, kentucky's young secretary of state. But the hill was too steep in a state president barack obama lost by 23 percentage points in 2012. Mcconnell, like republicans in every competitive state, relentlessly tied his opponent to the president, whose approval ratings have sagged. Mcconnell's allies taunted grimes for refusing to say whether she had voted for obama. If republicans gain at least six new seats, mcconnell, 72, is positioned to become the senate's majority leader. That would give him substantial powers to decide what legislation reaches the floor for votes, and when.

            "Washington ( ap ) — senate republican leader mitch mcconnell won a hard-fought sixth term tuesday, putting him a step closer to his lifelong dream of becoming majority leader and getting the gop off to a good start in its goal of taking control of the senate. Helping his chances was republican rep. Shelley moore capito's capture of the west virginia seat of retiring democratic sen. Jay rockefeller. Her victory, while not a surprise, gave republicans the first of six new seats they will need to control the senate for the first time in eight years. Kentucky democrats once had high hopes for challenger alison lundergan grimes, kentucky's young secretary of state. But the hill was too steep in a state president barack obama lost by 23 percentage points in 2012. Mcconnell, like republicans in every competitive state, relentlessly tied his opponent to the president, whose approval ratings have sagged. Mcconnell's allies taunted grimes for refusing to say whether she had voted for obama. If republicans gain at least six new seats, mcconnell, 72, is positioned to become the senate's majority leader. That would give him substantial powers to decide what legislation reaches the floor for votes, and when. Democrats privately said they hoped to limit their net senate losses to five seats, which would barely keep them in control. But"

Dodge says the demon is the world's fastest production car, able to go from zero to 60 in 2.3 seconds, just beating tesla's model s p100d sedan, reports the ap. Motor trend points out, however, that the model s was tested on dry asphalt and the demon on a coated drag strip. The demon can also complete a quarter-mile in 9.65 seconds, making it one of the \" 10-second cars \" so coveted in the fast and the furious franchise. It's no surprise, then, that dodge enlisted vin diesel to help reveal the street-legal car tuesday, ahead of the new york auto show. The car is also expected to appear in fate of the furious out friday, per the detroit free press. It's \" unlike anything we've ever done, \" says tim kuniskis of fiat chrysler, noting the demon's 840 horsepower and 770 pound-feet of torque give it enough power to pop a wheelie. \" this car is the epitome of power, \" adds race car driver leah pritchett, who worked on the car with dodge.

The man behind kickstarter's baubax travel jacket — which last year became the fourth most-funded project on kickstarter, raising $ 9.2 million — hopes to raise $ 100,000 with his new plans for clothes that wirelessly charge your devices. The jackets, hoodies, jeans, and shorts come with a pocket for your phone or other device that serves as a wireless charging pad thanks to hidden copper wire and a battery bank. The battery bank takes two to four hours to charge, using a baubax charging pad, and provides a full charge to a smartphone or two charges to a smartwatch, reports cnnmoney. If you'd rather not wear the battery, baubax also offers charging wallets, wristlets, and more. The clothing ranges in price from $ 69 for men's shorts to $ 169 for a jacket, but necessary add-ons drive up the cost. The $ 49 battery bank is sold separately, as is a $ 39 watch connector, $ 29 charging pad, and $ 15 phone case that provides wireless charging capability for iphones; android devices can go without the case. The prices are expected to climb as the campaign continues. Still, cherlynn low at engadget, who got to try some of the products, suggests they're worth a try. \" the soft interior lining made the clothes comfortable and the garments felt luxe, \" she writes. \" i was impressed that, even with the phones and battery packs in the pockets, the women's vest i tried on didn't show any unsightly bulges. \" the gear is scheduled to ship out in january.",

Called \" blowtox \" by some, it's really a bunch of botox injections in the scalp that prevent sweating and have the pleasant side-effect of keeping blow-dried or straightened hair from going all frizzy, fast company reports. \" it's common for soulcycle people, \" says new york city dermatologist dr. Patricia wexler. \" soulcycle is infamous for killing the hair. \" sound weird? well, botox may be known for smoothing wrinkles, but one of its \" off-label ' uses is to counteract \" severe underarm sweating, \" reports shape, which also observes that \" while it sounds crazy to inject something into your head, \" botox is fda-approved to treat adults with chronic migraines, who get such injections in their scalp. And as one dermatologist puts it to shape, the blowtox is \" definitely a trend. \" in some circles, $ 1,500 for a blowtox treatment that lasts up to nine months actually makes financial sense. After all, over that period, two $ 40 blow drys a week at an urban salon adds up to $ 2,880. The procedure itself takes roughly 20 minutes and involves about 150 to 200 injections ( one every square centimeter ) throughout the scalp, nyc dermatologist dr. Dendy engelman tells yahoo beauty. ( for comparison's sake, de-wrinkling the forehead typically requires no more than a dozen injections. ) shape notes that the needle used is thinner than a piece of hair; since the scalp is light on nerve endings, pain is extremely minimal. Fast company suggests that blowtox could make life easier for american women, who apparently spend 55 minutes daily on their appearance; shape observes that it can help women maintain \" their professionalism \" while squeezing in workday workouts.

The new york times reports abdul haroun was caught and arrested tuesday just outside england 10 hours after entering the tunnel in france. Haroun is allegedly the first migrant to walk nearly the entire length of the channel tunnel, and it's unclear how he was able to enter it without being spotted by heightened security. The telegraph says he got caught \" just steps away \" from the english side of the tunnel. \"it is illegal and very dangerous to attempt to enter the tunnel, and a person can be seriously injured or killed, \" a eurotunnel spokesman tells the times. \" mr. Haroun could now face prison, and he will likely not be able to get asylum. He has lost everything. \" the tunnel is dealing with nearly 1,000 attempts per day from migrants trying to cross the channel, many by stowing away in vehicles. At least 10 migrants have died since june, and thousands are living in makeshift camps near the entrance to the channel in france. The un calls the situation in the port city of calais a \" civil emergency, \" reports newsweek. As britain and the rest of europe struggle with how to deal with migrants, some are pointing to haroun's journey as a prime example of migrants'desperation while fleeing dangers in africa and the unwillingness of european countries to take them in.",

In a \"mad race \" to reach the uk, abdul rahman haroun, 40, was arrested by british police just steps away from the mouth of the eurotunnel in folkestone, kent. This is the first incident of a migrant successfully managing to walk the length of the channel tunnel where he is believed to have dodged trains travelling at up to 160kph. It is unclear how rahman haroun managed to scale four high fortified fences, evade security patrols, dogs and 400 cctv cameras inside the eurotunnel site on the french side. He is thought to have walked all day in almost complete darkness. He is now facing prison and is unlikely to be able to request asylum. An alert was sounded at 7.30am on tuesday after around 500 migrants attempted 600 times to get into the eurotunnel terminal overnight. An alarm went off in the southern tunnel at 'interval 5 ' in calais signalling an \"anomaly \" and traffic was suspended in the 17km stretch of track while police searched the tunnel area, sparking up to two-hour delays for shuttle passengers coming to france from the folkestone end. Kent police have confirmed that officers are investigating the incident after rahman haroun was located in the channel tunnel near to its exit at the folkestone terminal at 6.13pm on",
            "The united nations said dire living conditions for refugees and migrants living in the french port city of calais, delays in processing asylum applications and the rising number of people dying while trying to reach britain constitutes a \"civil emergency \" that won't slow down for the foreseeable future. Speaking from geneva on friday, vincent cochetel, director for europe at the united nations refugee agency ( unhcr ) said the u.n. Has been calling for an \"urgent, comprehensive and sustainable response \" by europe, and particularly france, to the crisis for the past year, the local france reports. \" let's treat that as a civil emergency, \" cochetel said, referring to the situation in calais. An estimated 3,000 people are living in a calais camp known as \"the jungle, \" while thousands have attempted to enter the channel tunnel in recent weeks, which runs underneath the english channel and connects the u.k. And continental europe. Ten people have died in the process since the beginning of june, according to unhcr. The european union agreed earlier this week to give $ 78 million to the u.k. And france to help both countries deal with the crisis. Women and children in calais are vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking and require particular attention from the french authorities for their protection, said melissa fleming, unhcr spokeswoman, said from geneva"

It is unclear how rahman haroun managed to scale four high fortified fences, evade security patrols, dogs and 400 cctv cameras inside the eurotunnel site on the french side. He is thought to have walked all day in almost complete darkness. He is now facing prison and is unlikely to be able to request asylum. An alert was sounded at 7.30am on tuesday after around 500 migrants attempted 600 times to get into the eurotunnel terminal overnight. An alarm went off in the southern tunnel at 'interval 5 ' in calais signalling an \"anomaly \" and traffic was suspended in the 17km stretch of track while police searched the tunnel area, sparking up to two-hour delays for shuttle passengers coming to france from the folkestone end. Kent police have confirmed that officers are investigating the incident after rahman haroun was located in the channel tunnel near to its exit at the folkestone terminal at 6.13pm on",
            "The united nations said dire living conditions for refugees and migrants living in the french port city of calais, delays in processing asylum applications and the rising number of people dying while trying to reach britain constitutes a \"civil emergency \" that won't slow down for the foreseeable future. Speaking from geneva on friday, vincent cochetel, director for europe at the united nations refugee agency ( unhcr ) said the u.n. Has been calling for an \"urgent, comprehensive and sustainable response \" by europe, and particularly france, to the crisis for the past year, the local france reports. \" let's treat that as a civil emergency, \" cochetel said, referring to the situation in calais. An estimated 3,000 people are living in a calais camp known as \"the jungle, \" while thousands have attempted to enter the channel tunnel in recent weeks, which runs underneath the english channel and connects the u.k. And continental europe. Ten people have died in the process since the beginning of june, according to unhcr. The european union agreed earlier this week to give $ 78 million to the u.k. And france to help both countries deal with the crisis. Women and children in calais are vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking and require particular attention from the french authorities for their protection, said melissa fleming, unhcr spokeswoman, said from geneva"

Orlandi's brother has even suggested some holy see complicity in the case. Just last year, an italian journalist claimed a stolen vatican document listed expenses for orlandi's care after she disappeared, reports the ap, though the vatican called the document a fake.

Found in the ancient city of pylos in may, the 5-foot-deep grave contained a bronze sword with an ivory hilt; a gold-hilted dagger; four gold rings; a gold necklace; gold, silver, and bronze cups; carnelian, amethyst, jasper, and agate beads; impressive stone carved seals; a bronze mirror; remains of a bronze suit of armor; an ivory plaque carved with a griffin; and more, per the new york times and los angeles times. \" probably not since the 1950s have we found such a rich tomb, \" says a researcher. \" you can count on one hand the number of tombs as wealthy as this one, \" another adds. Many of the treasures are from the minoan civilization on crete to the southeast and may hold clues about the mainland mycenaean civilization. The grave of the so-called \" griffin warrior \" dates to \" a transformative moment in the bronze age \" when the mycenaean civilization began borrowing heavily from the \" higher culture \" of the minoan civilization, researchers explain, noting further study may reveal how the minoan culture was adopted and adapted into what became mycenaean palace culture. For now, scientists guess the male warrior, aged 30 to 35, was perhaps the leader of a chiefdom, though dna analysis could reveal more about his origin. \" whoever he was, he seems to have been celebrated for his trading or fighting in nearby island of crete and for his appreciation of the more-sophisticated and delicate of the minoan civilization, \" a scientist says in a release. \" it's almost as if the occupant wants his story to be told. \" ( a professor recently found priceless coins from ancient greece and rome. )",

But, finally, mystery solved: military fighter jets were the culprit.

Yet if you're aiming to get rid of as much bacteria as possible, you've been washing your hands all wrong. After observing the hand-washing techniques of doctors and nurses, scientists at glasgow caledonian university in scotland say the who's six-step hand-washing technique is most effective, reducing bacteria by 21 %, compared to just 6 % with the three-step method backed by the cdc, per attn and cbs news. Lathering your hands with soap is actually just the first step. The six-step technique also involves rubbing the backs of hands, the backs of fingers, between fingers, then rotational rubbing of your thumbs, then fingers in your opposite palm, reports the telegraph. To determine which technique was best, scientists watched 42 doctors and 78 nurses wash their hands with an alcohol-based rub. Those who used the three-step technique saw the average bacterial count on their hands fall from 3.08 colony-forming units per milliliter to 2.88, compared to 3.28 to 2.58 cfu/ml for those who used the six-step method. However, the six-step method took 25 % longer to complete for an average of 42.5 seconds. That might explain why \" only 65 % of providers completed the entire hand hygiene process despite participants having instructions on the technique in front of them and having their technique observed, \" a researcher explains in a release.

        "summary": "While chocolate prices have fallen in recent years, you can expect a massive price hike by 2050 unless scientists at the uc berkeley innovative genomics institute reach their goal. Together with the mars company, scientists are working to create a genetically modified form of cacao that can withstand the effects of climate change, expected to take a toll on chocolate production in the coming decades, reports business insider. Snopes concludes that climate change won't make chocolate go extinct as some suggest, but it will cause temperatures to rise in the narrow stretches of land, roughly 20 degrees north and south of the equator, where cacao plants thrive in rainforest conditions, according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. And that would crimp production. For example, ghana and the ivory coast, which together produce more than 50 % of the world's supply of chocolate, will see a significant reduction in the growing area for cacao, which produces cocoa beans, with an expected temperature increase of 3.8 degrees fahrenheit by 2050. Scientists, however, are already working on a solution. Using the gene-editing technology crispr — which can also be applied to human embryos, per newsweek — they're hoping to create cacao seedlings capable of thriving in a warmer, drier climate to prevent the relocation of farms. Crispr researcher jennifer doudna says work on other crops threatened by climate change is ongoing. \" personally, i'd love a tomato plant with fruit that stayed on the vine longer, \" she tells business insider.

We recently conducted a survey of 300 professionals who are involved in the hiring process at their company to understand the use of social networks for screening job applicants. The results of this survey are shown in this infographic: so what do these results really tell us? from our perspective, there are three key takeaways: whether you like it or not, hirers are using social networks to screen job applicants.

But according to an affirmative action lawsuit filed by a group representing asian-american students, the school consistently scored asian-american applicants lower than other groups on personal qualities, which affected their admission chances, reports the new york times. The suit cites an analysis of 160,000 student records, which found that although asian-american students scored higher than other groups on academic and extra-curricular measures, their personal ratings lagged and lowered their overall rating. The group accuses harvard of increasing admissions of white, black, and hispanic applicants at the expense of asian-american students, reports cnn. The suit has forced harvard to disclose its admissions process, which has been a closely held secret. Harvard strongly defends its admissions practices, and accuses the group of using misleading data. Harvard's own research office found that if admission were based purely on academic achievement, 43 % of an admitted class would be asian-american, notes the boston globe. Last spring, 23 % of the students admitted were asian-american. Harvard has countered with an updated review that contradicts the group's finding and concludes that in the last decade, admissions of asian-americans grew by 29 %. Harvard is calling the suit, \"the latest salvo by ideological opponents of the consideration of race in university admissions. \"",

Netanyahu quickly added that us-israeli cooperation on intelligence is \" terrific. \" but the ap notes that \" it was never alleged that trump told the russians that israel was the source of the intelligence, just that he shared the information with the russians. \" speaking with netanyahu at a later news conference about a mideast peace deal, trump said, \" i've heard it's one of the toughest deals of all. \" per haaretz, he added that he has \" a feeling that we're going to get there eventually. \" more from trump's two-day visit to the holy land: earlier monday, trump visited the western wall, pressing a hand against it for half a minute before tucking a prayer note into a crevice. He is the first sitting american president to do so, notes abc news. The ap notes that melania and ivanka trump visited the women's section of the wall; the latter converted to judaism before she married husband jared kushner. \" iran must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon, \" trump warned while meeting israeli president reuven rivlin, per cnn. Trump said that in israel there's a \" great feeling for peace throughout the middle east, \" the ap notes, and that people have had \" enough of the bloodshed and the killing. \" rivlin told trump that \" we are praying for peace and we are pushing for peace for the last 100 years and with god's help somebody will bring us peace. \" an israeli lawmaker with an infamous reputation made for an awkward moment in a receiving line, reports the washington post. Oren hazan grabbed trump and pulled him in for a selfie as netanyahu tried unsuccessfully to deter him; trump did not look amused. For more on trump's visit, click here.",
