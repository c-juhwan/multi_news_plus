He will deliver his inaugural address at 11: 51am, according to the ap's timeline, and analysts say it will be one of the most closely watched in history. Advisers say that, like many predecessors, trump will issue a call for unity and give his vision of \" one america. \" experts tell nbc news that trump's unique and repetitive speaking style will drive the message home and maybe even go a little way toward unifying america. \" if i keep saying it, it becomes it, \" says new york university neuroscience professor david poeppel. In other coverage: the los angeles times reports that trump has said he looked to the speeches of ronald reagan, john f. Kennedy, and richard nixon to prepare — and of the three, nixon might be most relevant. After winning with a minority of the popular vote in the deeply divisive 1968 election, nixon called on the \" better angels of our nature \" in his inaugural address, saying america had heard too much inflated and bombastic rhetoric. \" we cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another, \" he said. The san francisco chronicle lists five things to look for in trump's address, including efforts to reassure foreign leaders. Ad-libs are also a strong possibility, though analysts say trying to wing it could be a big mistake. The speech was largely written by incoming senior white house adviser stephen miller, politico reports in its guide to inaugural events, which includes viewing tips and the order of the ceremony. The washington post looks at the many demonstrations that will be taking place across the capital on friday, including a few pro-trump events, as well as numerous \" counterinaugural \" protests. The \" let america hear us, roar for trump \" group will be sharing dupont circle with a pro-marijuana group that plans to hand out 4,200 joints. Time takes a look back at every inauguration day in us history, and at what every president had to say on the occasion. The times of london reports on the \" security nightmare \" posed by trump's first ride in the presidential limousine, which will take him past tens of thousands of people between the capitol and the white house. Many will be watching to see whether he chooses to walk part of the way as predecessors including obama did.

            "Atlanta ( ap ) — grambling state won the celebration bowl when it blocked an extra-point kick set back 15 yards by an excessive celebration with just over two minutes left, holding off north carolina central 10-9 saturday. Joseph mcwilliams surged in and swatted brandon mclaren's 35-yard try with 2: 14 remaining to preserve the tigers ' edge. Down 10-3, north carolina central had a chance to pull even after quentin atkinson shook loose and caught a 39-yard touchdown pass from scrambling malcolm bell. But atkinson took off his helmet while reveling with the crowd, drawing a personal foul penalty. Martez carter's 32-yard touchdown run to open the second half gave grambling state ( 11-1 ) its first lead. The tigers earned the bowl bid by winning the southwestern athletic conference championship to complete a dramatic resurgence by the program. The eagles ( 9-3 ) won the mid-eastern athletic conference under third-year coach jerry mack. Trailing 3-0 at halftime, grambling state opened the third quarter with a run-first plan. Following five power runs by 240-pound running back jestin kelly, the 175-pound carter looked extra-quick on his sharp cuts through the line on his touchdown run for a 7-3 lead.

            "Atlanta ( ap ) — grambling state won the celebration bowl when it blocked an extra-point kick set back 15 yards by an excessive celebration with just over two minutes left, holding off north carolina central 10-9 saturday. Joseph mcwilliams surged in and swatted brandon mclaren's 35-yard try with 2: 14 remaining to preserve the tigers ' edge. Down 10-3, north carolina central had a chance to pull even after quentin atkinson shook loose and caught a 39-yard touchdown pass from scrambling malcolm bell. But atkinson took off his helmet while reveling with the crowd, drawing a personal foul penalty. Martez carter's 32-yard touchdown run to open the second half gave grambling state ( 11-1 ) its first lead. The tigers earned the bowl bid by winning the southwestern athletic conference championship to complete a dramatic resurgence by the program. The eagles ( 9-3 ) won the mid-eastern athletic conference under third-year coach jerry mack. Trailing 3-0 at halftime, grambling state opened the third quarter with a run-first plan. Following five power runs by 240-pound running back jestin kelly, the 175-pound carter looked extra-quick on his sharp cuts through the line on his touchdown run for a 7-3 lead. The tigers threw only one play-action pass for a short gain on the touchdown drive. Grambling state's defense later set up more points. Arkez cooper sacked bell, forcing a fumble recovered by malcolm williams at the eagles 25. The turnover set up a 26-yard field goal by jonathan wallace.

The 26-year-old army medic survived the bataan death march but died in a pow camp and was buried in a communal grave along with 13 other americans who also died on nov. 19, 1942; four were later identified, but the remaining 10 were left in grave 717. After carrying out their own research and studying declassified burial records, family members zeroed in on grave 717, and \" manila #2 x-816 \" in particular — the only unknown in the grave that records show had gold inlays in his teeth, as kelder did. But it has taken a long fight, and a lawsuit, to get the joint pow/mia accounting command to agree to dig up the remains and carry out dna testing, propublica finds. The military also plans to disinter the remains of the others in the grave who were never identified. J-pac receives $ 100 million a year to do its work but only identified 60 service members last year out of the more than 73,000 americans still missing from wwii. Relatives — and j-pac whistleblowers — say j-pac is choosing to ignore modern technology and war documents that could identify many world war ii unknowns, stars and stripes found when it reported on the kelder case last year. The cousin who did the bulk of the investigative work says that while the family is overjoyed that they could soon finally be able to bury kelder in the family crypt in chicago, the government has only changed its stance because of the lawsuit, not because it sees it as the right thing to do. \" this will be a hollow victory for mia families unless the us government undertakes substantial and meaningful reforms of the mia accounting process, \" he says.

Politico points out that cnn, fox, and msnbc carried the entirety of trump's press conference even though hillary clinton and john kasich spoke during the 9pm et hour.

Some of the sisters ' ghastly crimes: they killed an infant by bashing his head against an electric pole, dropped a 7-month old to stop its crying, bludgeoned a boy while he hung upside down, and dismembered another and stuffed his parts in a bag, the post reports. The killing ended as it began — with a revenge kidnapping and murder in 1996, also plotted by their mother as revenge against her ex. The 9-year-old, his daughter, was dumped in a field and an eventual investigation led to the sisters ' other crimes. The sisters say they're innocent and wrongly convicted. A recent plea for mercy was rejected.",

It said eight people were killed in homs, central syria, including four shot dead by shabiha, an armed civilian group that supports assad's government. • libya's interim government has become the first in the world to recognise syria's opposition movement as a \" legitimate authority \" to rule syria. Guma el-gamaty, the uk-based co-ordinator for libya's national transitional council, urged other countries to do the same. \" we feel the syrian people have been let down by the world, and they need moral and political support, \" he said. • a former syrian vice president who became one of the country's most prominent dissidents was kidnapped in lebanon five months ago while visiting his daughter and is believed to be secretly imprisoned by the syrian regime as it tries to crush a 7-month-old uprising, his daughter and lebanese police said, according to ap.

After cops told her there was a video, sponsler said she \" did not remember \" doing the cartwheel.

Such is reality for the torti family in tennessee, whose son, owen, now 23 months, was diagnosed with the rare metabolic disorder lchad ( long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase ) as an infant. Because his body doesn't break down certain foods into energy, owen is at risk of his body breaking down his muscles for energy if he goes without food for more than an hour, reports abc news. \" he wants to act like a normal 2-year-old and he wants to go and play and run around as long as the other 2-year-olds, \" mom kayla torti says. \" unfortunately, we have to have him sit down and take little breaks. He doesn't know how to pace himself. \" lchad, which was first diagnosed in the 1990s, is so rare it only affects one in every 100,000 newborns and wasn't even on newborn screening tests until six years ago, reports wkrn nashville. To help with medical bills, two teams recently ran the ragnar relay through tennessee wearing \" all in for owen \" shirts and raised $ 15,000. Owen was born nine weeks premature, according to the family's youcaring page, and has been hospitalized 12 times in 20 months, typically when a metabolic breakdown causes breathing problems and seizures. If not treated, he could slip into a coma and even die. With the constant eating, his mother says he's developed an oral aversion to food and is on a special medical formula called lipistart, administered largely through a feeding tube. The tortis have a 25 % chance of having a second child with the same disorder. ( these parents are losing both their sons to a rare brain disease. )",

But that's why he thinks this bubble still has legs. Bubbles, he theorizes, take off when mainstream buyers get involved. Once better bitcoin sites appear, the masses will arrive, and \" prices will begin to get really crazy. \" speculators \" are just laughing at all the people who are dismissing bitcoin as a bubble, \" writes henry blodget at business insider.

But kurt eichenwald at vanity fair is far, far less convinced, calling the system \" very cool. But also very foolish. \" bitcoins aren't a currency anymore — currencies are based on \" a rational expectation of relatively stable valuation, \" and bitcoin prices are anything but stable or rational. \" in essence, the market is a fantasy, \" based on speculators and investors.

        "summary": "The west coast sardine population was down 72 % since 2006 per a fall assessment — the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the los angeles times reports: researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in southern california last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans — which also depend on sardines for food — are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines ( harvest maximums have been dramatically cut ) — and they often can't find any to catch ( the la times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing ). So what's going on? sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions ( the pacific decadal oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area ) and overfishing. Last month, pew charitable trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact.",

        "summary": "Yesterday was the day net neutrality died, with a court ruling that internet service providers aren't bound by fcc non-discrimination rules — so they can prioritize some traffic over others. The decision may mean major changes for the everyday user, and today, media sites are offering the details. Among their warnings: the wall street journal reports that the decision could have a huge impact on sites like netflix and youtube, whose video services hog a lot of bandwidth ( they account for 32 % and 19 % of peak web traffic, respectively ). If isps start making netflix, for instance, pay a usage fee to maintain speedy content delivery, that cost could make a serious dent in its profits — or trickle down to consumers. Isps could charge sites big fees in exchange for faster content delivery, potentially giving giants who can pay, like amazon, a big leg up over independent retailers — not to mention other small businesses, the huffington post notes. Providers might even go so far as to prioritize traffic to partner sites — time warner might push cnn, for example. Another anti-competitive fear, via buzzfeed: big companies might start paying your data fees for the use of their sites. That might sound good — free data? — but it would mean that companies with the ability to pay would have a major advantage over start-ups in winning users. As buzzfeed points out, \" if, in this future, you're choosing between two streaming music services, and one of them pays for your data, there's a very good chance you're going to pick that one. \" beyond concerns over fees, there are worries that providers could block certain websites completely: comcast users could theoretically end up with no access to, say, netflix or vonage, writes troy wolverton in the san jose mercury news. But net neutrality, in some form, may live to see another day, the journal notes, reporting that the ruling \" left open the door for the fcc to craft rules in a different form that might accomplish its earlier intentions. \"",

Instead, most of the attention is focused on the shooting violence that occurred elsewhere in the city, leaving more than 60 injured and 10 dead between friday evening and monday morning, reports wls-tv. The worst of it took place in a three-hour span starting around midnight saturday when 30 people were shot, reports the sun-times. Of those victims, 25 were injured in five mass shootings. Police say gang violence is mostly to blame, with shooters taking advantage of large gatherings in the summer weather to inflict the most casualties. \" if they shoot you, they don't even run, \" one man tells the chicago tribune. \" they just walk away, they ain't trying to run. \" a police spokesman says the extra police presence at the music festival did not play a role in the violence because officers working it were generally on their regular days off and on ot. The violence prompted rudy giuliani to enter the fray with a series of tweets backing garry mccarthy, a former chicago police chief who hopes to unseat mayor rahm emanuel. \" make chicago safe again! \" tweeted giuliani, who worked with mccarthy in new york when giuliani was mayor. Giuliani called mccarthy a \" policing genius \" thanks to his work with the data-centric compstat system, adding, \" chicago murders are direct result of one party democratic rule for decades. \" the washington post can't resist pointing out that giuliani misspelled mccarthy's first name as \" jerry \" and the current mayor's last name as \" emmanuel, \" and that mccarthy is a democrat himself.",

In a pair of tweets, he boasted about america's nuclear prowess. \" my first order as president was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal, \" he tweeted. \" it is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before. \" he then added, \" hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world! \" earlier, in response to north korea's threat to strike guam, trump retweeted a fox news story about us air force jets taking off from andersen air force base in guam for a training mission, with a caption noting pilots could be ready to \" fight tonight, \" notes the wall street journal. Related: ad-lib? the new york times reports that trump's \" fire and fury \" line from tuesday was improvised. The newspaper says the president did not run the language by advisers in advance, including chief of staff john kelly. A piece of paper trump had in front of him was reportedly a fact sheet on the opioid crisis. Politico reporter josh dawsey's sources tell him the words were not \" carefully vetted, \" adding, \" don't read too much into it. \" mattis weighs in: secretary of state rex tillerson may have had a more calming tone on the subject wednesday, but defense chief james mattis followed up with some tough language. Among other things, he warned in an afternoon statement that north korea should \" cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and destruction of its people, \" per cnn. American nukes: trump's tweets on the us arsenal were apparently in reference to a review of nuclear weapons that was ordered on jan. 27 but isn't expected to be completed until year's end, reports the washington post. Such reviews are required by congress about every eight years. After the last one in 2010, barack obama announced a $ 1 trillion plan to upgrade the nuclear arsenal over 30 years. Given all that, fact-checkers are pushing back on trump's boast that he beefed up the arsenal, and that's putting it mildly.

At 38 minutes, it was the shortest acceptance speech from an incumbent since gerald ford in 1976, politico notes. The democrats were having a great convention until the president delivered a \" warmed-over rehash of his stump speech \" with a \" laundry list of familiar proposals, \" writes molly ball at the atlantic. His speech — which \" seemed engineered as a series of defensive moves \" — was \" so befuddlingly flat as to make you wonder whether its lameness was intentional, \" she writes. The speech wasn't make-or-break for obama, but he could surely have done better than the \" fourth best speech of the democratic convention \" after bill clinton's, michelle's, and joe biden's, writes yuval levin at the national review. Obama \" laid out no discernible second-term agenda of his own, \" and his attack on romney's \" supposed plans to eradicate all of government while giving tax cuts to the wealthy \" was the speech's \" sole coherent message, \" he writes. Chris cillizza at the washington post names his winners and losers of the convention, and puts obama between the two categories. \" at times, it felt more like a state of the union address than a convention acceptance speech. It was workmanlike more than inspirational, \" he writes. The speech wasn't in the same league as bill clinton's, \" but neither will it be remembered as a colossal flop. \" the speech was \" forceful, animated, and error-free — but not among his most lustrous rhetorical moments, \" write niall stanage and amie parnes at the hill. The speech \" highlighted obama's accomplishments, drew broad outlines of what a second white house term would bring, and was jam-packed with stark, sometimes mocking, contrasts between his policies and those \" of mitt romney, but there wasn't a glimpse of the \" more elevated oratory that powered his historic journey to the oval office in 2008 \" until the final minutes.",

They both love the con game, but who's playing who? here's what critics are saying: richard corliss at time is a fan. \" the mix of longtime star and minx on the rise is one tasty element in the success of a movie that approaches the modest goals and effortless allure of a 60-year-old hitchcock, \" he writes. Smith \" takes a welcome break from glowering sci-fi roles \" and writer-directors glenn ficarra and john requa \" deserve some credit in letting will be will in the star's first charm barrage since 2005's hitch. \" steven rea at the philadelphia inquirer admits smith \" shows some of the movie-star wattage that's been missing from his recent pics. He charms. \" there's also \" combustible chemistry \" between smith and robbie, but the movie just \" disappoints, \" rea writes. \" even if you're willing to forgive its sinkhole plotholes and farthest-fetched conceits, the film... Ultimately makes no sense. \" betsy sharkey, on the other hand, says this \" rom-com-con \" is \" an irresistible reminder of all the reasons we first fell for the fresh prince so many years ago. \" writing at the los angeles times, she notes the romantic role of nicky fits smith perfectly, while robbie is \" more than holding her own \" as his match. \" the scams are rubik's cube complicated, but what keeps you guessing is whether the romantic connection between jess and nicky is real or just another con. \" but mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle isn't convinced. In a review titled \" will smith just stole $ 12 from your pocket, \" he argues focus is \" ridiculous in every detail. It's a movie with no truth that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it. \" nicky and jess lack \" impact, \" partly because \" smith is not a strong leading man, \" he says. Viewers are left \" waiting for the trick, which is not the same as being fooled. \"",

            "Musical chairs or russian roulette? sometimes there's as much tense drama in the casting of a hollywood movie as there is in the finished product. This week's example: focus, a caper film about a veteran con man and the young woman he takes as his accomplice. Ryan gosling, then brad pitt and ben affleck were touted as the dapper con, while the female lead was reckoned to be played, at one time or another, by jennifer lawrence, emma stone, kristen stewart, michelle williams, jessica biel, rose byrne, olivia munn — basically, every working actress under 35. Since focus conjures up a more relaxed time in hollywood history, when the top stars radiated their golden appeal in romantic comedies about duplicitous souls, writer-directors glenn ficarra and john requa might have dreamed of cary grant and grace kelly, who paired in alfred hitchcock's 1955 to catch a thief. Grant had just hit 50, and kelly was 25, but their upmarket glamour",

He wants a new party to combine the best of their movements, and even floats a name for it: the innovation party. Vandehei suggests someone like mark zuckerberg or sheryl sandberg could lead it, while michael bloomberg could provide financial backing and then perhaps run the treasury. \" right now, millions of young people are turned on by a 74-old-year socialist scolding wall street \" and \" millions of others by a reality-tv star with a 1950s view of women, \" writes vandehei. His ideal candidate is instead someone from outside the political system who can talk to americans in \" unvarnished \" language. He or she should also be from the military or select a running mate who is, because \" terrorism is today's world war. \" click for his full column, which is meeting with some heated criticism.

        "summary": "Reactions are flying in to the supreme court's decision to strike down much of arizona's immigration law, but one of the most extreme came from the court itself. Speaking in dissent of the ruling, antonin scalia questioned whether arizona and other states would have even joined the union if they'd known today's ruling was coming, politico reports. He said the ruling particularly \" boggles the mind \" in light of obama's recent executive order on immigration. He said delegates at the constitutional convention would have \" rushed to the exits \" at the thought of obama's move. But while scalia may have been incensed, seemingly every other quarter was declaring victory, or at least partial victory. For example: jan brewer called it a \" victory for the rule of law, \" and for the 10th amendment, because \" the heart of sb 1070 can now be implemented, \" meaning the provision requiring police to check the immigration status of people stopped for other crimes. Joe arpaio agreed. \" i think this is a good section that's been upheld, \" he said, though he lamented the loss of \" the authority to arrest illegal aliens just by being there illegally. \" president obama said he was also \" pleased \" with the decision, which \" makes unmistakably clear ( that ) congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform, \" but said he was still \" concerned \" about the remaining provision, according to cnn. Mitt romney's statement, meanwhile, was decidedly vague. \" today's decision underscores the need for a president who will lead on this critical issue, \" he said. \" president obama has failed to provide any leadership on immigration. \" he said every state has a duty and right to secure its borders, but offered no explicit opinion on the ruling itself.",

Per the atlanta journal-constitution, mohammed tawfeeq — an iraqi national and permanent legal us resident who's an editor and producer for the news network — was held at hartsfield-jackson atlanta international airport sunday evening as he returned after being on assignment in iraq. Now tawfeeq, who's enjoyed permanent resident status since 2013, is suing the department of homeland security and other government agencies for his detention, which the suit says was illegal. Per courthouse news, tawfeeq was returning to the us from baghdad ( he travels to the middle east often for work ) on jan. 29 when a us customs and border protection officer pulled him aside. Tawfeeq's green card and passport were examined, he was interrogated about his trip, and he was told he'd need to wait for \" an email \" from the proper authorities to clear him to enter the country. When he was finally allowed to leave, no one offered further explanation, and they didn't even stamp his passport or give him any entry papers. \" the executive order has greatly increased the uncertainty involved in current and future international travel \" for legal resident such as tawfeeq, the suit claims, per the hill. It also adds that, as a legal permanent resident, he should be afforded \" greater procedural protections than non-immigrants/temporary aliens. \" a cnn rep says the network supports tawfeeq and that his complaint \" is a basic request to clarify and assert his rights under the law, \" per the hill.",

He takes over from the previous interim president, who briefly held power when longtime leader el abidine ben ali fled the country in the face of mass protests over rising prices, joblessness, corruption, repression, you name it. The storyline continues to shape up as one that could set a historical precedent — an arab populace rising up against its leader. Anthony shadid, new york times: \" the most enthusiastic suggested it was the arab world's gdansk, the birthplace of solidarity in poland, which heralded the end to communist rule in eastern europe. That seemed premature, particularly because the contours of the government emerging in tunisia were still unclear. \" shadi hamid, huffington post: \" no one should underestimate what happened yesterday in tunisia. If the revolution succeeds, it may very well prove to be one of the most important moments in recent arab history.

The protests'success gripped a region whose residents have increasingly complained of governments that seem incapable of meeting their demands and are bereft of any ideology except perpetuating power.

        "summary": "Since the story of baby gammy went viral several days ago, the australian government has announced that it is looking into whether it can intervene in a case described by the australian immigration minister as \" very, very murky, \" particularly because it took place in another country, reports the telegraph. The baby, now 7 months old, was allegedly abandoned by his australian parents, who paid a 21-year-old thai woman to be a surrogate mother following an ivf procedure that ultimately resulted in twins. But the australian couple says they were never told about the second baby, though surrogate pattaramon chanbua, a street vendor with two young children of her own, thinks they're lying about that. She says she was asked to abort gammy but refused due to religious beliefs, and she's now raising him — and she wants to raise his twin sister as well after new allegations arose against the couple who took her and left gammy behind. Sources tell australia's 9 news that the father is a pedophile who was jailed in the 1990s on child sex convictions; his wife says she's aware of those convictions but that her husband is a changed man. The ap also spoke to a police officer who says the man is a convicted sex offender. Child protective services is reportedly looking into the father's suitability now, and chanbua says she'd take the baby girl she carried back. As for whether she'd turn gammy over to the couple at this point, she says, \" never. Not in any way. \" he's currently in the hospital with a serious lung infection and will need surgery for a heart problem, reports the guardian. A gofundme campaign started by a charity has raised more than $ 230,000 for gammy's care, and some have argued that gammy should be able to access australia's health care.

But foye has bigger fish to fry than working moms getting to leave work on time. She's advocating for \" meternity leave \" to balance out the maternity leave given to new moms. She defines meternity leave as \" a sabbatical-like break that allows women and, to a lesser degree, men to shift their focus to the part of their lives that doesn't revolve around their jobs. \" foye says a meternity leave would allow childless women to get the time to refocus and reevaluate their lives — time that is already afforded to new mothers. Foye actually took a meternity leave for herself and says the experience was invaluable. \" i may not have been changing diapers, but i grappled with self-doubt for the year and a half that i spent away from the corporate world, \" she writes.

Trump, who has offered mixed messages on russian interference in us elections — at times even calling it a \" hoax \" — acknowledged in a tweet that the midterms are a likely target. \" i ' m very concerned that russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming election, \" trump wrote. \" based on the fact that no president has been tougher on russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the democrats. They definitely don't want trump! \" that's despite russian president vladimir putin saying outright last week, following the leaders'summit in helsinki, that he wanted trump to win in 2016. Us intelligence agencies also have determined that russia interfered in the election to help him win, and the agencies have warned there are ominous signs of more cyberattacks to come. As trump tweeted on tuesday, house republicans held a hearing on election security in which lawmakers — even some of trump's closest gop allies — strongly criticized russian interference and pointed to an indictment this month of 12 russian intelligence officers. The indictment alleges that the russians broke into democratic email accounts and tried to penetrate state election systems. House oversight and government reform chairman trey gowdy noted that the indictment said there is no evidence the vote count was affected, \" but that was not likely for a lack of trying. \" meanwhile in the senate on tuesday, two senators introduced bipartisan legislation to impose new russian sanctions, saying the us \" must make it abundantly clear that we will defend our nation. \"",

According to nasa's calculations, its new horizons spacecraft flew by pluto at 31,000mph at 7: 49am edt today; confirmation of that will come tonight, some 13 hours later, reports the ap. The confirmation will mark the completion of nasa's tour of the \" classical nine \" planets, reports the ap, which notes that pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of mars: new horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on pluto and its moons charon, styx, nix, kerberos, and hydra during the flyby. \" i can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it, \" principal new horizons scientist alan stern tells the bbc. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \" phone home, \" the ap notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about pluto. \" the science we've already made is mouth-watering, \" says stern. \" the pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty. \" among nasa's findings in recent days: pluto's north pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the christian science monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. Livescience notes that new information from pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \" there's a feeling among scientists that pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it '",

This winter, though, an aquatic robot will be deployed to help slow the invasion of the invertebrates … by killing them, scientific american reports. The cotsbot, developed at the queensland university of technology, is a small submarine outfitted with cameras, sonar, gps, and a syringe-tipped arm. Following a pre-programmed path along the reef, the robot scans for crown of thorns starfish. Once it identifies its target, the cotsbot pumps it full of bile salts that, as scientific american puts it, \" digest the animal from the inside \" before it can separate and regenerate ( one starfish can produce millions of young ). The cotsbot, which can kill more than 200 starfish in eight hours, will augment the efforts of human divers. \"it's now so good it even ignores our 3d-printed decoys and targets only live starfish, \" one researcher says. It is believed the starfish has destroyed some 230 square miles of live coral in the past three decades, per the times, which says the outbreak may be linked to starfish-nourishing algal blooms resulting from fertilizer runoff. Overfishing of the starfish's predators may also be to blame, per scientific american. Check out the cotsbot in action in this video.",

        "summary": "Three scientists from the united states, france, and canada have been awarded the nobel prize in physics for advances in laser physics, including the first woman to take home the prize in 55 years. The swedish royal academy of sciences on tuesday awarded half the $ 1.01 million prize to arthur ashkin of the united states, and the other half will be shared by gerard mourou of france and donna strickland of canada, per the ap. Strickland is the third female laureate in physics, but the first in more than half a century, reports the bbc. The academy says ashkin developed \" optical tweezers \" that can grab tiny particles such as viruses without damaging them. As the guardian notes, \" this means scientists can hold even living cells in place, allowing them to probe their inner workings. \" strickland and mourou helped develop short and intense laser pulses that have broad industrial and medical applications. The nobel panel's explanation: \" ultra-sharp laser beams make it possible to cut or drill holes in various materials extremely precisely — even in living matter. Millions of eye operations are performed every year with the sharpest of laser beams. \" ( a cern scientist just got suspended for saying physics was built by men. )",

The 16-year-old girl has not been identified, but a grand jury is deciding whether her father should face any charges for shooting the teen after finding him in his daughter's bedroom. However, the family of victim johran mccormick says the da should also take action against his daughter, because she allegedly lied to her father and said she didn't know johran — which arguably led to his death. Their idea: the girl could be charged with accessory to murder or even involuntary manslaughter, khou reports. Activists including johran's mom, zakia mccormick, rallied yesterday in front of the home where he died. But earlier this month, experts told the houston chronicle that an indictment for murder against the father would be unlikely. Says one, \" if it's perceived that there is a'stranger ' in his home, there could be a viable claim of self-defense or defense of others. \"",

Its predecessor ruled the box office in 2016, but does this sequel from david leitch — which cost a stuntwoman her life — have the power to do the same? it seems so, with the movie getting a solid 85 % positive rating from critics and audiences alike at rotten tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: \" if you love films that keep you guessing, laughing and surprised on the edge of your seat, this is a must-see, \" writes colin covert at the minneapolis star tribune. \" more gory, bizarre, offbeat and even obscenely funny than the original, \" the film \" revels in its self-referential perspective \" while reynolds \" radiates a bizarre charisma, \" covert writes. Not to be outdone is a \" delightful \" zazie beetz as lucky superhero domino. \" there's no way it could equal the freshness and irreverence of the 2016 original. Fortunately, the sequel comes off as much more than a cash grab, \" writes calvin wilson at the st. Louis post-dispatch. He mostly credits reynolds. In \" the role of his dreams, \" the actor \" totally sells the character's blend of reckless self-absorption and reluctant heroics. \" even so, \" another sequel really isn't necessary, but it's in the works anyway. \" jen yamato wasn't as impressed. \" while the sequel benefits from reynolds'superhuman charisma, \" it \" merely rehashes and recycles the same wink-wink barbs that worked the first time around \" and offers \" uninspired plotting, \" she writes at the los angeles times. Thank goodness for celine dion. Her music brings \" new life, emotion and a winking, self-aware wit into the action, \" yamato says. The movie \" comes blazing out of the shoot, but dips in its second hour, like a stretched-out piece of taffy, \" writes adam graham at detroit news. \" still, there is a lot left to like here, and reynolds and company crank out better, more outrageous laughs than most pure comedies.

        "summary": "For decades, conspiracy theorists have claimed the famous \" backyard photo \" of lee harvey oswald, which shows him holding the same type of rifle used to assassinate jfk, is a fake — a claim that oswald himself made when he was arrested. But thanks to a scientist who has studied this photo before and stated previously it was \" highly improbable that anyone could have created such a perfect forgery with the technology available in 1963, \" that claim has now been debunked. A new study out of dartmouth, published in the journal of digital forensics, security, and law, used sophisticated 3d imaging technology to analyze key details of the photo, including oswald's pose, and found that the photo is indeed authentic, a press release notes. \" our detailed analysis of oswald's pose, the lighting and shadows, and the rifle in his hands refutes the argument of photo tampering, \" hany farid, the study's senior author, says. Both the warren commission and a special house committee on assassinations had already found photo tampering hadn't taken place, and farid had done studies in 2009 and 2010 that determined the photo's lighting and shadows were indeed feasible, per phys.org. But some said that oswald's pose in the photo, in which he appears to be standing somewhat off-balance, was a physical impossibility, so this time around farid and his team put the photo through a rigorous 3d stability analysis. By adding appropriate mass little by little to each section of a 3d model of oswald, they were able to examine oswald's balance to show he certainly could have stood that way. The study also found, once again, that the lighting, shadows, and rifle length were also plausible. \" with a simple adjustment to the height and weight, the 3d human model that we created can be used to forensically analyze the pose, stability, and shadows in any image of people, \" farid says in the release. ( the cia has admitted to covering up jfk's assassination, though. )",

Manteo mitchell was 200 meters into the race's first leg when a bone in his leg snapped. He managed to finish the rest of the lap in excruciating pain, and keep the us in the competition, cnn reports. After he limped off, an x-ray confirmed that the 25-year-old athlete had a broken left fibula, the smaller of the two leg bones. It is possible to run with a broken fibula, but most people would find the pain unbearable, slate notes. Mitchell originally hurt himself missing a step as he went up some stairs at the olympic village earlier in the week, but he says he felt fine after treatment. But \" as soon as i took the first step past the 200-meter mark, i felt it break. I heard it, \" he says. \" i even put out a little war cry, but the crowd was so loud you couldn't hear it. I wanted to just lie down. It felt like somebody literally just snapped my leg in half. \" the us — which has won gold at the eight olympic 4x400-meter relays it entered — now advances to tonight's final, although the team has not yet announced its replacement for mitchell.",

Mitchell, who was halfway through his segment of the men's 4-by-400 relay when he felt something snap, did what he said \"almost any person would've done in that situation \" — he finished the remaining 200 meters. His endurance wasn't for naught: after mitchell limped off, his three teammates completed the relay and qualified for the 4-by-400 final. After the race, doctors diagnosed mitchell with a complete break of the left fibula and said the bone would heal in four to six weeks. How difficult is it to run 200 meters on a broken fibula? very difficult, but not impossible. The fibula is the smaller of the two bones that make up the lower leg, the other being the tibia. Unlike the tibia, the fibula is non-weight-bearing. As such, it is possible to run on a broken fibula. The pain, though, would be intense and would likely debilitate many athletes. The fact that mitchell made it around the track in just more than 46 seconds — a time that placed him in a tie for fifth out of eight runners — is extremely impressive. Advertisement",

He has been cited as a key influence by many in the hip-hop community — such as rapper-producer kanye west, who closed his platinum-selling 2010 album my beautiful dark twisted fantasy with a track built around a sample of scott-heron '",
            "Gil scott-heron is frequently called the \"godfather of rap, \" which is an epithet he doesn't really care for. In 1968, when he was nineteen, he wrote a satirical spoken-word piece called \"the revolution will not be televised. \" it was released on a very small label in 1970 and was probably heard of more than heard, but it had a following. It is the species of classic that sounds as subversive and intelligent now as it did when it was new, even though some of the references — spiro agnew, natalie wood, roy wilkins, hooterville — have become dated. By the time scott-heron was twenty-three, he had published two novels and a book of poems and recorded three albums, each of which prospered modestly, but \"the revolution will not be televised \" made him famous. Scott-heron calls himself a bluesologist. He is sixty-one, tall and scrawny, and he lives in harlem, in a ground-floor apartment that he doesn't often leave. It is long and narrow, and there's a bedspread covering a sliding glass door to a patio, so no light enters, making the place seem like a monk's cell or a cave.

The woman came forward last year and told police that former teacher michael layne williamson, 60, had repeatedly assaulted her over a period of years. He was sentenced to one to 15 years in prison by a judge who berated him for disgracing the \" noble profession \" of teaching. Williamson, who pleaded guilty in may to aggravated sexual abuse of a child and another count of attempted sexual abuse, apologized in court. \" this indiscretion of mine was of the most heinous type, \" he said. \" let me stop you right there, \" retorted judge thomas willmore. \" it is not an indiscretion. You broke the law. \" the unidentified victim, now 35, displayed a photo of herself as an eighth-grader and said williamson ruined her life. \" you put it all on my shoulders, those of a 13-year-old, to carry, \" she said. \" i always blamed myself. \" she said she left the state and kept silent but on a trip back home, the pain was too much. Supporters of williamson, however, wrote that he was a respected teacher and golf coach who \"fell victim to the persuasions of a girl, \" reports the herald journal. It's possible this isn't the end of williamson's legal trouble: last year, the state changed the law to allow victims of sexual abuse to file civil lawsuits years after the fact, notes the deseret news. ( in texas, this teacher was accused of having a longtime sexual relationship with an eighth-grade student. )",

            "Salt lake city — the utah legislature passed a bill wednesday that eliminates the statute of limitations for lawsuits against perpetrators of child sexual abuse. Deondra brown, co-founder of the nonprofit foundation for survivors of abuse, watched from the senate gallery as lawmakers engaged in a final debate before voting to pass hb277 and sending it to gov. Gary herbert for his signature. \"on behalf of victims across the state of utah, we're excited to know that we can kind of breathe, take our time in healing, and come forward and tackle that big legal case when and if we are every ready, \" brown said. Brown has followed the progress of hb277 and testified in favor of the bill at committee meetings throughout the legislative process. Three brown sisters, members of the 5 browns piano quintet, were molested by their father, keith brown, as children. The sisters sought criminal charges in 2010 against their father, who had also been their professional manager. Keith brown was sentenced in march 2011 to 10 years to life for sodomy on a child, a first-degree felony, and one to 15 years each on two counts of sex abuse of a child, a second-degree felony. The crimes occurred when the girls were 13 years old or younger. Current utah law limits civil actions to four years after a victim",

        "summary": "A tiny creature grew inside a florida woman for two months after her honeymoon in belize — and no, she wasn't pregnant. Weeks after returning home, the 36-year-old noticed an itchy spot on the left side of her groin and assumed she'd been bitten by an insect, reports live science. Thinking it was an infected spider bite, her doctor fruitlessly prescribed antibiotics. Dr. Enrico camporesi of tampa's memorial hospital next took a look, noticing a hole in the center of the wound, which felt hard, as though something were inside. A surgeon suspected it was a living thing, and turned out to be right. Cutting open the lesion, doctors found a tapered human botfly larva with rows of spines and hooks meant to keep it buried in the woman's skin for up to 128 days, reports the miami herald. Commonly found in central america, a human botfly first deposits her eggs on an insect, like a mosquito, which carries them to human or animal hosts. Injected in skin via bites, the egg hatches into larva that eventually drops from the skin and continues developing, eventually reaching the size of a large bumblebee, per the journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports. Though the botfly didn't reach the pupa stage in this case, it wasn't necessary for its human host to go under the knife. Belizeans cover lesions — with petroleum jelly, nail polish, and even bacon strips, per the herald — to suffocate larvae, which emerge for air and can be removed with tweezers. Still, the florida patient was healed within a week. ( caterpillar larvae might prove useful. )",

The woman had gone to tampa general hospital telling doctors that she thought the reddish lesion could have been an insect bite. She said she had already gone to a primary care doctor about the lesion. That earlier doctor had given the women a course of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole; but when the woman had finished her antibiotics, she said the lesion was still there, though the redness had improved, according to researchers who investigated the case.

        "summary": "Decaying road tunnels have left brussels in a perpetual state of traffic chaos, but repairs are apparently on hold due to what citylab deems possibly \" the world's worst excuse for poor infrastructure \": hungry rodents. Because the transportation department was housed 25 years ago in a hotel ( apparently when the responsibility for the roads passed from federal hands into local ones ) and didn't have a lot of space, the original construction blueprints for some of the city's major tunnels were instead filed away in the pillars under a highway bridge, reuters reports. Apparently the four-legged creatures got to them before their two-legged counterparts. The telegraph reports the plans were stored in that less-than-ideal location for two decades, and were moved to a typical storage facility in 2010. But by then \" they were apparently eaten by mice, \" the ex-chief of brussels ' infrastructure department informed city officials on wednesday.

            "Brussels officials have reportedly blamed \" mice \" for their inability to tackle chronic traffic jams, saying hungry rodents probably ate the original plans to improve underground tunnels in the belgian capital. As eu leaders convened for a summit to deal with british threats to quit the bloc and to discuss the refugee crisis, they found a city often in gridlock due to repeated closures of key road tunnels caused by crumbling concrete and years of decay. Now the belgian capital's regional parliament has been told that repairs are being held up because original construction plans have apparently eaten by rodents. The unlikely claim was made during an investigation into the parlous state of a series of tunnels under brussels, which are under threat of falling apart. A special parliamentary commission has been set up to look into how the 7.1 miles of underground traffic tunnels in brussels have become so dilapidated and whether it is too late to save them. During a hearing this week, christian de buysshcher, the former head of roads for the body in charge of the tunnels, was asked: \" what happened to the plans of the tunnels when the responsibility was transferred from the federal to the brussels government? \" he replied that the original plans were archived in 1989 inside a pier under a viaduct linking the liège motorway to the boulevard reyers, as at the time",
            "Could this be the world's worst excuse for poor infrastructure? the city of brussels has a novel excuse for recent holdups to vital public works. Faced with europe's worst traffic, the belgian capital has been desperately trying to patch up tunnels whose poor state has caused road closures. Now brussels has finally explained why the repairs are taking so long: the tunnel's plans have all been eaten by mice. Claiming rodents ate your master plan sounds like the municipal equivalent of saying the dog ate your homework, but apparently it's true. According to city transit officials, plans for the tunnels were stored inside bridge supports on one of brussels ' main highways — a bizarre enough fact in itself. They seem to have ended up there because, when the brussels capital region was founded in 1989, the relevant transport department was in temporary digs in a hotel and was short on space. It turns out a concrete pillar is not the ideal place to store valuable documents, which have all disappeared, apparently eaten. By now, the tunnel plans have probably long since been chewed to pieces by hungry teeth and passed through a host of murine digestive systems. The local response to the news is pretty much what you'd expect: people seem to be pausing occasionally from belly laughs to bang"

        "summary": "For julian assange, there's good news and bad news. The good is that a un panel has ruled in his favor and found that britain is essentially keeping him in arbitrary detention, reports the bbc. The bad is that london doesn't care and vows to arrest him if he tries to leave the ecuadorean embassy, reports reuters. The developments come after assange appealed to the un working group on arbitrary detention to look into his case. The official ruling is to be made public on friday, but both the bbc and the guardian say the panel has sided with assange. The wikileaks founder has been holed up in the embassy for more than three years, hoping to avoid being extradited to sweden to face sex-crimes charges. In an earlier tweet, assange said he would turn himself in to police if the panel ruled against him, reports the ap. \" however, should i prevail and the state parties be found to have acted unlawfully, i expect the immediate return of my passport and the termination of further attempts to arrest me, \" he wrote. That appears unlikely: a spokesman for prime minister david cameron said thursday that the ruling isn't legally binding and that assange — who also fears extradition to the us over the leaking of military secrets — would be immediately arrested if he tries to leave. Wikileaks, meanwhile, says it is awaiting confirmation of the news reports about the ruling.",
