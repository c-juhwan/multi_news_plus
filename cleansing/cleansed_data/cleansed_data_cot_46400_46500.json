Emergency generators were used until an off-site power supply could be connected to the fort calhoun plant, and officials say there has been no danger to the public, reports abc news. Federal authorities, including the head of the nuclear regulatory commission, are on the scene. The berm was considered an \" additional layer of protection \" at the plant, and a work crew will attempt to patch it, said a spokesman for the omaha public power district. The plant, near brownville, has been closed for refueling since april, and the operation won't be restarted until the floodwaters recede, according to ap. Nebraska's other nuclear power plant, some 75 miles south of omaha, was threatened by flooding earlier this month and will be shut down if floodwaters exceed a specific level. Federal officials are continuing to monitor the situation. The fort calhoun berm breach was the latest trouble in flooding of the missouri river that has inundated some 4,500 homes. It could be up to six weeks before the river falls back to its pre-flood stage.",

Meanwhile, in-person voting will get its start in minnesota on sept. 23. Why early voting can be important, other than offering convenience for the voter: these types of ballots make up anywhere between 50 % to 75 % of the overall votes cast in certain battleground states, including north carolina, florida, and arizona. Plus, decent returns can provide momentum. \" if one campaign does significantly better in harvesting early votes, that campaign will have a substantial advantage as election day approaches, \" paul gronke, director of the early voting information center, tells the ap.

But while the company is \" working with other estates of famous funny guys and funny girls, \" he adds, \" these just happened to be amenable estates who see the vision. \" and that vision for the former taxi star and the sanford &amp; son patriarch includes what david says is the best stuff from their famous routines, as well as biographical snippets that lend further insight into the two funnymen. Although a director at the licensing agency for the kaufman-foxx deal concedes to the times that the idea is \" uncomfortable \" to some, david insists the mission of hologram usa — which has also projected wikileaks founder julian assange and late-night host jimmy kimmel into remote locations — is no different than any other nonfiction biopic you might see. Others aren't so sure. Jesse david fox writes for vulture that this idea emerged because, as the headline on his post puts it, \" people who crave money often have stupid ideas. \" the idea creeps him out, he writes, and \" if they respected the ' work, ' if they respected comedy, they'd know this is a terrible idea. \" but michael kaufman, andy's brother, tells the times that he's on board.

            "The logic seems sound: the more lottery tickets you buy, the better your odds of striking it rich. So when the mega millions jackpot hit a record $ 540 million thursday, it was only natural for some houstonians to pool their resources with friends and colleagues to buy as many tickets as possible. After all, there are plenty of millions to go around. The more the merrier. Gary grief, executive director of texas lottery commission, said he encourages pools, provided that, as with all lottery wagering, they are conducted responsibly. \" my advice is to formalize those agreements unless you are dealing with people you completely trust - and trust, potentially, with hundreds of millions, \" said grief, who also serves as lead director of mega millions. Six construction workers in new jersey learned that lesson the hard way. The co-workers had pooled their money for years to play the lotto. They relied on one member of their group, americo lopes, to purchase the tickets. In november 2009, one of the tickets he bought hit the $ 38.5 million jackpot. Lopes cashed it without telling his co-workers, and walked away with more than $ 17 million in one lump sum after taxes. Lopes later claimed he bought the winning ticket with his own money, not funds collected from the group,"

The captives, fishermen from vietnam, taiwan, cambodia, indonesia, china, and the philippines, were freed saturday with the help of the hostage support partners group, which negotiated with tribal and religious leaders. John steed, a retired british colonel who works as a coordinator for the group, tells the afp that the men are in \" reasonable condition, \" considering that they have \" spent over four and a half years in deplorable conditions away from their families. \" he says the men are the \" last remaining seafarers taken hostage during the height of somali piracy. \" steed says one crew member died during the march 2012 hijacking of their omani-flagged vessel and another two died during their captivity. He says the boat sank a year after its capture and the men were taken to a village in somalia, where they were held by \" pirates making increasingly irrational demands. \" on sunday, the freed sailors were flown from somalia to kenya, where one of them told the bbc he felt like the \" walking dead \" after so long as a captive. He said food and water were in short supply and the men had eaten rats to survive. \" eat anything, even you not like, you feel hungry, you eat it, \" he said. \" you eat rat, you cook it. \"",

These are just some of the images contained in a detroit police department report regarding the may death of chris cornell, obtained from an foia request by the detroit free press. The press notes that while the report doesn't contain any new bombshells, it does elaborate on what happened the night the 52-year-old soundgarden singer took his own life at the mgm grand detroit, including how bodyguard martin kirsten found his body and what emergency workers discovered when they entered his suite. Kirsten went to cornell's room when vicky cornell, the singer's wife, became alarmed because he sounded distraught on the phone. The bodyguard forced his way into the suite and found the awful scene. \" i went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened, and i could see his feet, \" kirsten says in his statement. He also notes vicky cornell told him that when she called the hotel front desk to try to get info, \" they hung up on her \" the first time around. Tmz has a gallery of the images, some of which are graphic, including photos that show bottles for such prescription drugs as prednisone ( an anti-inflammatory ), an antacid, and lorazepam, which is used to treat anxiety. The free press notes that cornell's autopsy report, released in early june, said he had the lorazepam in his system, as well as a decongestant, caffeine, a sedative, and naloxone, which is used to reverse the effects of opioids — but the report adds these medications \" did not contribute to the cause of death. \" the report also includes a 911 call from the hotel, but the paper notes \" no photos of cornell's body were visible. \"",

The note, dated 30 june 1845, was addressed to baudelaire's lover jeanne duval. The poet, who was 24 years old at the time, attempted to commit suicide on the same day - but survived. The french auction website osenat said the letter sold to a private buyer for three times the estimated price. In the letter, baudelaire informed his mistress of his intention to take his own life. \" by the time you receive this letter, i will be dead, \" it said. \" i am killing myself because i can no longer live, or bear the burden of falling asleep and waking up again. \" image copyright afp image caption baudelaire is regarded as one of the greatest french poets of all time baudelaire, who had money problems after squandering his inheritance, stabbed himself in the chest but suffered no serious injuries. He lived for another 22 years, writing in that time the volume that established his reputation, les fleurs du mal ( the flowers of evil ). His works influenced generations of french poets.

The turkey point nuclear power plant near miami has been around for four decades and powers more than 1 million homes, according to fusion. But problems started being detected with the system of canals used to cool it two years ago after florida power &amp; light increased the plant's power output. Now a study released monday found tritium levels in biscayne bay up to 215 times higher than normal, the miami herald reports. It's unclear at the moment if those levels of tritium, a radioactive isotope, are dangerous to people or animals, but they are high enough to \" suggest a consistent flow \" from the cooling canals into the ocean. A state representative calls the study \" the last straw \" and is asking the epa do something to \" protect the public. \" stoddard says he and others warned florida power &amp; light about the canals years ago but were ignored. \" they argued the canals were a closed system, but that's not how water works in south florida, \" he tells the new times. Just two weeks ago, a judge ordered the utility to fix the canals because they were contaminating groundwater and potentially endangering drinking water. Stoddard says there are only two solutions: replacing the canals with cooling towers or shutting the whole thing down. ( radioactive groundwater was detected in new york city. )",

The investigators had to peer through windows of most of the buildings because the personnel on site only had keys to three of them, abc reports. The inspectors recommended that the us army take another look at plans for building other border police facilities to ensure they are appropriately sized. Their report noted that sustaining the kunduz facility would require people with the skills to maintain electrical generators, fueling stations, and water treatment systems, but there are no plans in place to train anybody.",

Wkyc reports on the june 19 incident, when about 40 people, including members of the delta sigma theta sorority, headed to the orange village eatery and didn't like the service. The manager called the cops, claiming the customers were cursing, disrespectful, and \" worked up about the bill. \" some of the patrons, however, say the manager assumed they wouldn't pay what they owed because they were african-american. Chante spencer, one of the customers, tells cleveland.com that one guest who'd waited 25 minutes for her bill got fed up and said she was leaving. She did stay, spencer says, but the cops were summoned. Once police arrived, the manager, who claimed that more than one person had threatened to leave without paying, asked officers to stick around to make sure all of the customers in the group settled their individual bills, per a police report, which adds the cops stayed for about an hour. In a statement, ohio rep. Marcia fudge, herself a member of the sorority, calls the incident \" a chilling reminder that no african-american is exempt from the impact of racial profiling when a group of professional women known for their service and advocacy are victims. \" \" we clearly fell short of delivering great service to our guests, \" the parent restaurant tweeted thursday. \" the manager involved no longer works for us because they mistreated a guest. \" the restaurant also noted it has invited those involved back for a better experience.

        "summary": "Police in fort worth, texas, are investigating after a video surfaced showing an officer firing a burst of pepper spray at a group of motorcyclists on a highway. Members of the group say about 200 motorcyclists were traveling on highway 287 around 3pm sunday when an officer pulled over a pickup truck, one of the group's \" safety vehicles, \" reports wfaa. As captured by one of the biker's helmet cams, the officer — identified as w. Figueroa, per the fort worth star-telegram — exited his vehicle on the shoulder of the highway, then sprayed a yellow mist in the direction of the bikers as they passed him. A police rep confirms it was pepper spray and that figueroa documented its use in a police report, reports nbc dallas-fort worth. She didn't, however, reveal why he used it. Police say the department had received several complaints about the motorcyclists weaving in and out of traffic and generally driving recklessly around the time of the incident. But \" if you're worried about safety, why would you pepper-spray a large group of bikers like that? \" asks biker jack kinney. An ambulance called to the scene over exposure to pepper spray — apparently for those in the pulled-over pickup — transported one person to the hospital who asked to be checked out, notes the star-telegram. Another four refused treatment. Figueroa, a six-year veteran with the force, has been placed on administrative duty during the investigation.",

A study released this week found that high cholesterol may make it tougher for couples to get pregnant, the washington post reports. Researchers came to their conclusion after following 501 couples who were trying to conceive ( and controlling for other potential infertility contributors, like body mass index ). Their finding held true when either both partners or just the woman had high cholesterol; no significant effect was seen if only the man had the condition. The effect was the most pronounced when both would-be parents had high levels, per a statement released by the national institutes of health. As study leader enrique schisterman explains, cholesterol plays a key role in the production of hormones like estrogen and testosterone. \" an excess sometimes creates an imbalance of too much hormones, or too little hormones. You have to have a sweet spot. \" schisterman cautions that the finding doesn't mean couples should rush to take cholesterol-lowering drugs, but he does encourage couples looking to become parents to lead a healthy lifestyle.

And it's a prominent family at the heart of the mess: that of 89-year-old conservative activist phyllis schlafly, who the ap describes as famed for her campaign to defeat the equal rights amendment in the 1970s, and whose nephew, tom schlafly, began brewing under the family name, without conflict, many years ago. Phyllis schlafly petitioned the us patent and trademark office to reject the request some 18 months ago, as did her son andrew schlafly. He tells the star-ledger the name wasn't so much an issue \" when the business was in the family \" ( a reference to the private equity firm, sage capital; tom schlafly has stayed on as chairman of the board for the brewery ) but nonetheless points out that booze is associated with values his mother has fought against, and says supporters assume she's tied to the beer. Settlement talks continue, notes the ap, with the trademark office being asked to determine whether schlafly is primarily a last name or a commercial brand that deserves legal protection.

        "summary": "During a meeting with an international group of nuns on thursday, pope francis casually mentioned that he's open to making the biggest change to women's role in the catholic church in more than 1,000 years. When one of the sisters asked about the possibility of a commission to look into having women serve as deacons, the pontiff said it was a good idea and it would be useful for him to have the point clarified, the new york times reports. In the church, deacons are clergy who are allowed to preach and carry out weddings and baptisms, the washington post reports. They were important in the early centuries of the church but the role gradually withered from around ad500 onward, though the second vatican council in the 1960s brought back permanent deacons and made the role available to both married and single men. \" many experts believe that women should also be able to serve in this role, since there is ample evidence of female deacons in the first centuries, including one named phoebe who is cited by saint paul in his letter to the romans, \" the vatican press office explained after francis made his remarks. The wall street journal notes that rising numbers of deacons have helped the church cope with a shortage of priests. Women active in the church in the us say they're thrilled by the apparent shift in policy, which many of them did not expect to see in their lifetimes. \" it's very hopeful, \" catholic scholar phyllis zagano tells the national catholic reporter. \" it displays francis ' openness to scholarship, to history, and, most importantly, to the needs of the church. \" ( last month, francis released a landmark document on marriage, divorce, sex, and family life. )",

A gene called mkp-1 was identified by yale university investigators after comparing the genetic codes of 21 deceased people who had been diagnosed with depression with those of 18 otherwise healthy individuals. Mkp-1 plays the role of an off switch over a cascade of brain chemicals called mapk that are crucial to the survival and function of neurons, according to the paper, which appears in the journal nature medicine. \" this could be a primary cause [ of ], or at least a major contributing factor to, the signalling abnormalities that lead to depression, \" said the study's lead author, ronald duman, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology. The scientists created \" knockout \" mice whose mkp-1 had been deactivated to explore the hunch that altering mapk levels played a role in depression. Mice without mkp-1 were happily resilient to stress. But stressed mice with the gene developed depression-like symptoms which were then eased by using anti-depression drugs, they found. Depression, like many other mood disorders, is believe to have multiple causes, including genetic, for its symptoms vary widely among individuals. As many as 40 percent of depressed patients do not respond to drugs, which are mainly based on boosting uptake of a brain chemical called serotinin. Almost one in six americans are afflicted by depression in any given year, and the disorder costs the us economy 100 billion dollars annually, according to figures quoted in the study.

As many as 40 percent of depressed patients do not respond to drugs, which are mainly based on boosting uptake of a brain chemical called serotinin. Almost one in six americans are afflicted by depression in any given year, and the disorder costs the us economy 100 billion dollars annually, according to figures quoted in the study. The finding \" identifies mkp-1 as a potential target for a novel class of therapeutic agents, particularly for treatment-resistant depression, \" yale said in a press release. Copyright © 2010 afp.

The federal lawsuit appears to be the first stemming from the outbreak, though many lawsuits are expected. The suit alleges that barbe puro suffered headaches and nausea after receiving injections in her neck to ease chronic back pain in september, but she believed the symptoms weren't abnormal. She said she was later contacted by the minnesota department of health, informing her that she may have received contaminated shots sold by the new england compounding center. Officials have identified the massachusetts-based company as the source of steroid shots suspected in the fungal meningitis outbreak that has sickened about 170 people and been linked to the deaths of 14 others. Puro, of suburban minneapolis, underwent a painful spinal tap to test for the illness over the weekend, said her attorney, jeff montpetit. Results are pending. Center spokesman andrew paven declined comment thursday, saying the company hadn't seen the lawsuit. Paven said the lawsuit was the first he'd heard about. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from the company for puno's injuries, along with class-action status to cover other people who were injured after receiving the potentially tainted medication in minnesota."

The number of cases nationwide reached 184, an increase of 15 from thursday, cdc said. The outbreak is a major national health scandal, with multiple investigations under way and a leading democratic lawmaker, senator richard blumenthal of connecticut",
            "A minnesota woman who may have received tainted steroid injections blamed for the nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis sued the drug seller on thursday, though she hasn't been diagnosed with the rare illness. The federal lawsuit appears to be the first stemming from the outbreak, though many lawsuits are expected. The suit alleges that barbe puro suffered headaches and nausea after receiving injections in her neck to ease chronic back pain in september, but she believed the symptoms weren't abnormal. She said she was later contacted by the minnesota department of health, informing her that she may have received contaminated shots sold by the new england compounding center. Officials have identified the massachusetts-based company as the source of steroid shots suspected in the fungal meningitis outbreak that has sickened about 170 people and been linked to the deaths of 14 others. Puro, of suburban minneapolis, underwent a painful spinal tap to test for the illness over the weekend, said her attorney, jeff montpetit. Results are pending. Center spokesman andrew paven declined comment thursday, saying the company hadn't seen the lawsuit. Paven said the lawsuit was the first he'd heard about. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from the company for puno's injuries, along with class-action status to cover other people who were injured after receiving the potentially tainted medication in minnesota."

            "A center point man with a violent past is now charged with attempted murder in the pistol-whipping of a birmingham police detective during a traffic stop friday morning. Police today identified the suspect as 34-year-old janard shamar cunningham, also known as janaris shavar cunningham. He has at least a half dozen convictions dating back to 1999, and as many arrests in which charges were dismissed during the same time period. Cunningham is charged in the beating of a detective who is a six-year veteran of the force. Authorities said cunningham stole the detective's gun and then repeatedly hit him in the head until the detective stopped moving.

Artur samarin — who called himself asher potts when he enrolled at harrisburg high school in 2012 — pleaded guilty to passport fraud and social security fraud in august, the ap reports.

Samarin, who will probably be deported when he finishes his sentence, was a star student at harrisburg high — and a runner-up for homecoming king — before his true age was discovered. At thursday's hearing, his lawyers said he had been one of the most distinguished students in the high school's history and had supported charities, including the central pennsylvania food bank, pennlive reports. The lawyers said samarin had been pushed into the fraud by michael and stephayne potts, a couple who became his \" adoptive parents \" but treated him like a servant — and reported him to authorities when he \" escaped. \" they are also facing fraud charges related to samarin's high school career.",

Surveillance video showed two still-unidentified students breaking into the enclosure at bayworld marine park, grabbing the penguin, and driving it to the nearby shoreline, where they released it. The problem is that buddy the penguin was raised in captivity and is \" completely ill-equipped to survive in the wild, \" says the park manager. Staffers are searching up and down the south african coast, hoping buddy will come back to land before he runs out of fat reserves in two or three weeks. \"the individuals stated that they did not agree with the penguins being kept in captivity and that their intention was to capture and then release a penguin back into the wild, \" says a bayworld statement, per news24.com. The park has reported the theft to police and says the men's lawyer has been in contact. The african penguin is an endangered species, with less than 20,000 breeding pairs in the wild. The loss of buddy is especially bad for the park, as he was successfully paired with a mate. Penguins mate for life, and park officials worry buddy's mate, francis, may not accept a new partner if buddy does not return. What's more, one of their two recently hatched chicks has died since his disappearance. ( there may be good news about these 150,000 missing penguins. )",

In a press release, plaintiffs ' lawyers say california state polytechnic university put both fitbits and ecg sensors on 43 separate subjects tested for 65 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise, and found that the purepulse technology in the fitbits had an \" extremely weak correlation \" with the heart rate recorded by the ecgs. The researchers say the fitbit measurement was up to 20 beats per minute off during exercise. In some cases, fitbits on both wrists recorded different rates — and heart rates of zero were recorded on subjects who were definitely not zombies. Fitbit argues that the study, which was funded by the lawyers, \" lacks scientific rigor and is the product of flawed methodology. \" the company notes that the ecgs were consumer-grade ones, not clinical devices. Alex montoye, an assistant professor of clinical exercise physiology at ball state university tells cnn that his own research has found that fitbits are pretty good at giving a \" ballpark estimate of activity levels, but these are difficult elements to measure perfectly. \" he says the fitbit is not a medical device and doesn't claim to be one, which is why the company tends to use words like \" track \" instead of \" measure \" in marketing materials and never promises 100 % accuracy.

As for cocaine, she's only used it \" like 10 to 15 times, \" she said, and while she didn't enjoy it, \" it allowed me to drink more, i think that's why i did it. \" she also cited a dependency on adderall, which she says she's \" much calmer \" without. She's not taking it anymore, she told oprah. The only drug she's currently on? \" vitamins, \" lohan said. Oh, and \" i take nexium. Because i have acid reflux. \" lohan's explanation for why her addiction started: \" a lot of stuff went on with my family when i was young and i grew up in a very chaotic home and then there were moments of everything being wonderful and perfect and then things being so uncontrollable and chaotic that — it's something people go through and unfortunately i waited too long to face it. \" she admitted she was addicted to the chaos, but now she's \" exhausted \" by it and ready to regain everyone's trust and \" get the thing that's made me the happiest my whole life back, which is just work really hard and stay focused and prove myself. \" speaking about her troubles with the law, lohan said, \" i somehow inside of me knew i wanted to go in jail. I think that was subconsciously going on in my head through my actions... Just to have some peace. \" winfrey expressed concern with a yoga retreat in europe lohan planned to attend, suggesting it wasn't a good idea \" just a few days out of rehab. \" lohan said she's \" different \" now, but ended up canceling the trip two days later.

The issue is a little more complicated than the usual gun-control debate, however: this time, both the nra and the aclu opposed the measure. The move by president obama in december required the social security administration to provide information about people who met certain criteria to the national database for background checks, reports nbc news. Affected would be those who get full disability benefits because of a mental illness and who were deemed unfit to manage their own finances, explains cnn. They were to be notified that they might not be eligible to own a gun, though they could appeal. The obama administration estimated it would apply to 75,000 people. Last week, the house and senate passed a bill to undo the rule, and trump signed it into law on tuesday. He had promised to \" un-sign that [ bill ] so fast \" even before he became president, reports usa today. It was criticized by both the aclu, which said it added to the stereotype that equates mental illness with violence, and the nra, which opposed it on second amendment grounds.

The flight crew had called ahead to cops about 20 minutes after takeoff, ktrk reports, with a delta spokesman telling the star tribune the couple had \" [ become ] aggressive and created a disruption in the cabin. \" the rep didn't say what allegedly set off either 35-year-old blake fleisig or 36-year-old anna koosmann, but a passenger who shot video of part of the incident says koosmann got irritated when she was told she had to stay seated and couldn't use the bathroom just a few minutes into the flight. The video shot by patrick whalen from the plane's front row shows police leading fleisig and koosmann down the aisle of the plane to disembark while other annoyed passengers take verbal swipes at them — until fleisig punches another passenger, per whalen. Cops can be seen bringing fleisig to the floor and yelling at him to \" stay down. \" as the two are finally led off the plane, an officer says to koosmann, \" you're already going to jail, \" to which she replies, \" why? for what? for what? \" the two were hit with disorderly conduct charges ( koosmann also was charged with obstructing the legal process ), and an airport rep tells the new york daily news fleisig was booked and released right at the airport, while koosmann remained \" uncooperative \" and was taken to a local detention center.

            "Laura king expected a tally of good food on her restaurant tab. A credit for her children's good manners, on the other hand, came as quite a surprise. King, her husband and their three children, ages 2, 3 and 8, recently feasted on pizza, pasta and mushroom ragu at an italian eatery near their home in kingston, wash. The kids – no strangers to restaurants -- quietly enjoyed their meals. \"they were just being their normal selves, \" king told today.com. \"our server came to our table and just really thanked us for having exceptionally behaved children. \" today the restaurant receipt notes a discount for the king kids ' good behavior. Then, the server brought out a bowl of ice cream for the children to share and when the family checked the bill, it turned out the dessert was on the house.

Archbishop carlo maria vigano, the vatican's ambassador to the us, was appointed by benedict xvi and is known for his hardline stance against same-sex marriage, the washington post reports. Vatican officials say francis wasn't briefed on the davis case and the meeting \" should not be considered a form of support, \" which has left church insiders wondering whether vigano deliberately blindsided francis or merely underestimated just how controversial the meeting would turn out to be, the new york times reports. A vatican source tells cbs 2 that francis was \" exploited \" by those with their own agendas and the meeting should never have happened. Davis ' lawyer, who first announced the meeting, tells the times that it was set up by vigano — whom he met at an anti-gay marriage rally in washington, dc, earlier this year — but they were \" led to believe that the invitation did come directly from pope francis. \" the lawyer says the vatican's description of the meeting as a very brief one among dozens is \" absolute nonsense \" and \" somebody is trying to throw some people under the bus. \" bishops are required to ask for permission to resign when they turn 75, and it seems likely that vigano's will be accepted when he reaches that age in january, the times notes.

The wall street journal takes a look at the initial new landscape; the full shift is expected to take as long as five years. Five stand-out details: the new lingo: workers can join one of 300 \" circles \" ( ie, work teams ) run by a \" lead link \" ( sort of a project manager ) where they focus on a specific kind of work ( ie, customer service ) and might air \" tensions \" ( ie, work problems ) or discuss how they're \" energizing a role \" ( that being what one's job is now called ). The new lingo, part ii: can you translate yet? the journal has this jargony line ( and an interpretation ) from john bunch, who's heading the shift to holacracy. \" the idea is for each person to selfishly process their own tension. The reaction round is a sacred space. \" one specific experience: in the title-less world, brironni alex, 26, is no longer a customer-service manager, but now has \" more time for a workplace diversity committee and to perform on the zappos dance team, \" per the journal. How meetings have changed: at their end, employees can air their thoughts. A 24-year-old employee says she hears things like \" i can't wait to eat my leftover pizza for lunch. \" one specific circle: the journal highlights one called \" reinventing yourself, \" which former managers are encouraged to join as part of their quest to figure out what they should do in the company now that they can't manage.

Increasingly, employees and managers ( but also doctors, nurses, teachers, etc. ) are disillusioned with the way we run organizations today. We all somehow sense that there simply must be better ways to run our businesses, nonprofits, schools and hospitals. This hopeful talk shares the key insights from groundbreaking research into the emergence, in different parts of the world, of truly powerful and soulful organizations that have made a radical leap beyond today's management thinking. ( it starts with the story of how organizations evolved over time. You can skip to minute 28 to hear the story of buurtzorg, one of the extraordinary pioneering organizations, that revolutionized home care in the netherlands. At minute 36, the talk goes into self-management. At minute 52 into wholeness at work. And at 1: 06 into evolutionary purpose in organizations.

The israel antiquities authority says the coins appear to date back to between 909 and 1171, and that they're from north africa and the middle east. \" there is probably a shipwreck there of an official treasury boat which was on its way to the central government in egypt with taxes that had been collected, \" an iaa rep tells afp. Another theory: the coins could have been to pay soldiers stationed at the local garrison. Some of the coins show bite marks — indicating that they were at some point examined up close and personal for authenticity, notes afp — but are otherwise in excellent condition. The divers at first thought the stash, found in the harbor at caesarea national park on israel's mediterranean coastline, was made up of toy coins, but they quickly reported the find when they realized it was the real deal. \" they discovered the gold and have a heart of gold that loves the country and its history, \" says the iaa rep. But thanks and praise is all they get: no finder's fee, says the iaa. ( check out how much gold was found last year on a shipwreck dating back to 1857. )",

            "It's a story with everything: sex, secrets, religion, money, and an empire hanging in the balance. So it's no surprise that the allegations against atlanta bishop eddie long have quickly sparked a media frenzy. ( three lawsuits filed in dekalb county allege that the pastor used his \"spiritual authority \" to coerce male church members \"into engaging in sexual acts and relationships for his own personal sexual gratification. \" ) it doesn't hurt that the allegations of improper conduct focus on the pastor of a 25,000-member megachurch who is one of the most outspoken homophobes in the black church. He galvanized his followers in 2004 to support an amendment to georgia's state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. As i am a member of atlanta's large black gay community, this story is also a personal one. It raises the question, why is the black church so hostile to gay men and women? will we ever be accepted as we are? atlanta boasts, at least anecdotally, the nation's largest black gay population.

        "summary": "Donald trump doesn't think jeb bush is setting a very good example for americans when he speaks spanish, but a bilingual arizona news anchor is likely in the bush camp on this one. Vanessa ruiz — who was born in miami, grew up in colombia, and studied in spain before jumping into journalism and nabbing a job at 12 news in july — isn't even taking heat for speaking spanish, but for her non-anglicized pronunciation of spanish words, reports the new york times. The station's news director tells the times that some viewers have complained about how ruiz \" rolls her r's when pronouncing spanish words, \" as well as how she says certain words like \" mesa \" ( \" mess-uh, \" like many spanish speakers say it, instead of \" may-suh \" ). As noted by the times, the criticism of ruiz underscores the issues some people have with the proliferation of spanish in the us, which now has the second-largest population of spanish speakers in the world. As the arizona republic puts it, an \" eloquent and unapologetic \" ruiz took to the air monday to address the issue, gently noting, \" i do like to pronounce certain things the way they are meant to be pronounced. And i know that change can be difficult, but... Over time i know that everything falls into place. \" she added, per 12 news: \" certain words just sound better when said in their natural way. It really is that simple.... My intention has never been to be disrespectful or dismissive. \" a bilingual mom of three tells the times when she heard ruiz on air for the first time that \" i kind of pumped my fist and celebrated. Hey, look, she's not afraid of her heritage. \" ruiz posted on facebook wednesday: \" i ' m happy it has ignited a dynamic conversation. … i am more proud now than ever to be an american, and also, a latina. Thank you. Gracias. \" ( for the record, spanish is considered the happiest language. )",

That's because the school's oft-touted claim that since 1975, 90 % of its graduates looking for employment found jobs in their field within six months actually has no basis in fact, according to the department of education. The university was asked to back up the assertion last year, but it \" could not provide evidence to substantiate this claim, \" the department announced thursday. As part of a settlement, devry must now abandon the claim, post a notice on its website for two years noting the claim is unproven, and keep at least $ 68.4 million in reserves in case of any future issues, report npr and the wall street journal. However, unlike competitors corinthian colleges and itt technical institute — which recently folded after missteps — devry will keep its access to federal funding. Devry, which has more than 50 campuses nationwide, says it's \" pleased \" to have the issue cleared up, though it suggests its claim wasn't all that bogus. It says it simply lacked \" student-specific data for the period from 1975 to october 1980. \" the university adds it will \" continue communicating its strong student outcomes. \" devry is currently fighting an ftc lawsuit over another of its claims: that its graduates have 15 % higher incomes one year after graduation than graduates from all other universities.",

The mars orbiter mission took off from a base on india's east coast this morning and if it survives the journey, it will carry out experiments including searching for methane in the martian atmosphere. Nasa, the european space agency, and the former soviet union have successfully sent probes to mars, but failure is pretty common, cnn notes. Britain's beagle 2 probe vanished in 2003, a chinese probe was lost last year, and japan's nozomi orbiter was unable to reach its goal in 1998. Some commentators wonder why a country with such high rates of malnutrition is spending money on a mars program, but the program's defenders say the project is relatively cheap, at $ 72 million, and will result in technological development that could benefit india's industries.",

The uk's beagle 2 probe separated from the european space agency's mars express orbiter in 2003 but nothing was ever heard from the lander. It will take 10 months for india's mars orbiter mission to reach the red planet after lifting off from the satish dhawan space centre near chennai. The probe will explore the planet's surface features, minerals and atmosphere. Isro is hoping to discover more about the loss of water from mars, map the sources of methane gas, as well"

So hersh is wrong, writes one expert, or \" zawahiri is helping obama forge evidence to boost us-pakistan relations, which seems like an unusual hobby for an [ al-qaeda ] leader. \" the sheer scope: hersh \" produces no supporting documents or proof \" yet \" accuses hundreds of people across three governments of staging a massive international hoax that has gone on for years \" and \" when facts seem to squarely contradict his claims, his answer is that this only goes to show how deep the rabbit hole goes. \" the blowback: the earlier pieces that made hersh's name \" were all quickly confirmed by dozens of independent reports and mountains of physical proof.

But with a great deal of coastal development, how one gets to this public strip of land can be far murkier, as a new lawsuit involving a private property near half moon bay demonstrates. In 2008, silicon valley billionaire vinod khosla, who co-founded sun microsystems, bought 53 acres of martins beach, which sits just south of san francisco; two years later, he decided to close the gate and paint over the billboard that had directed beachgoers ( it's a popular surfing spot ) to a for-a-fee parking area the previous owners had set up, reports the guardian. In other words, the former owners played nice, and khosla didn't want to play at all. In his lawsuit filed sept. 30, khosla accuses the california coastal commission, state lands commission, and san mateo county of unfairly targeting him. The san jose mercury news explains that the latter two bodies informed khosla that what he did in revoking the beach access fits the coastal act's definition of development, which means he needs to apply for a coastal development permit. Khosla says the agencies are trying \" to harass, coerce, and single [ him ] out \" and says they never interfered when the prior owners locked the gate during winter months or private events. The legal director for the surfrider foundation, which has filed its own lawsuit to restore public access to the beach, calls it \" almost laughable \" that khosla would claim \" state agencies could harass and coerce such a powerful man. \" ( check out the nation's best beaches. )",

Khosla, who has a net worth of $ 1.55bn, co-founded the technology company sun microsystems and now runs the venture capital firm khosla ventures.

It's sad enough that amy winehouse lost her life at such a slight age. It adds a special ache that the garish events of her personal story will initially swamp any appreciation of her very real talents and accomplishments. At her sober best, winehouse displayed a rich and resonant instrument, emotive enough for soul but skilled enough for jazz. At times, she could strike an original mean between etta james and billie holiday. Winehouse's deep tone had a full bodied kick, yet her phrasing took it in unexpected directions, extending the intrigue and beauty of the melodies.

            "Or, how facebook makes money and advances its own interest by helping apple sell apps on its own store. It's a surprisingly clever move. The facebook app center will \" sell \" ios apps. ( credit: facebook ) the app store model is winning the evolutionary battle for software businesses. It's how operating system manufacturers are making ongoing money, especially on mobile devices. But now facebook, which has a social networking platform and not an operating system of its own, has figured a way to take advantage of the model. The challenge, for a platform like facebook, is that it has to build a store on top of these other existing stores. It is especially tricky to build on top of the apple app store, which remains the only legitimate channel for users to get apps onto ios devices. Facebook, instead of opening a store per se, has announced that it's opening a hybrid marketplace: part store, part showcase. Facebook will be selling ( i use the term loosely ) three things: 1. Pointers to mobile apps on other stores. The app center will list mobile apps for ios and android, but it won't sell them. Rather, it will point users to complete their purchases on those stores. Facebook won't make money from the sale of apps on other stores. Facebook still wins big, though.

Prosecutors accuse restaurant owner mohammed zaman of subbing in peanuts for almonds in his ground mix to save money and deliberately concealing the switch to customers, reports the bbc. That proved deadly for 38-year-old paul wilson of north yorkshire, who picked up a take-out order from indian garden from in easingwold and later died after going into anaphylactic shock. Wilson suffered from a severe peanut allergy, something he pointed out to the staff — the words \" no nuts \" were written on the lid of his order. A few weeks before his death, a 17-year-old girl nearly died after eating food from another one of zaman's restaurants, reports the telegraph. When her mother called afterward to ask whether it contained peanuts, she was told it did not, say prosecutors. After that incident, an inspector found a box of ground peanuts in a kitchen of one of zaman's restaurants and ordered that all of his customers be informed about its use, something that allegedly never happened. \" mohammed zaman received numerous warnings that he was putting his customers ' health, and potentially their lives, at risk, \" says a prosecutor, per the yorkshire post. \" his was a reckless and cavalier attitude to risk and one that we, the prosecution, would describe as grossly negligent. \" zaman, strapped for cash, allegedly told his food supplier to sub in peanuts in order to cut his cost in half, then ignored the supplier's demand that he inform customers of the change.

Instead, on friday, it exploded while he was smoking it, the arkansas man tells knwa. \" i put it to my mouth and as soon as i pressed the button on the bottom, the device exploded, \" he says. His wife, who was on her way to the garage to find her husband at the time, says she heard what sounded like gunfire and saw flames. \" that's when i looked back and i found my husband bent over here in the garage and gasping for air and he couldn't even speak to me, \" she says. In addition to burns on his mouth, throat, and hand, josh also ended up with severed lips and shattered teeth; they believe the e-cigarette's battery caused the explosion. The tale is just the latest bit of bad publicity for the e-cigarette industry: a study published this week finds that adolescents who use e-cigarettes are 30 % more likely than those who've never used the devices to report respiratory problems like coughing or phlegm, reuters reports. \" e-cigarettes are certainly not harmless and serious health problems of long-term use will probably emerge with time, \" the study author says. But the idea of banning e-cigarette sales to teens is not as good as it may sound: another recent study finds that when people under 18 are not allowed to purchase e-cigarettes, rates of traditional smoking among that age group actually go up, medscape reports.

        "summary": "It's now referred to as \" america's first mass shooting, \" and those who remember it say it certainly felt like the start of something new, strange, and horrible when charles whitman started shooting people at random from the university of texas clock tower on aug. 1, 1966. In a coincidence that some find chilling, monday is not only the 50th anniversary of whitman's rampage, which killed 17 people, but also the day the state's \" campus carry \" law comes into effect, allowing people to carry concealed handguns at public universities across texas. A roundup of coverage: the ap answers some questions about the new law, including details on what parts of campuses guns will be allowed in — and on why it was so controversial. Claire wilson james was eight months pregnant when whitman — who received a sharpshooter badge in the marines — shot her in the belly from the tower, killing her unborn son. He also killed her boyfriend, tom eckman. She talks to the austin american-statesman about why she opposes the new law. She recalls that as the rampage continued, austinites were urged to bring their guns to campus to try to stop him — but that \" only made it worse. \" the university's daily texan paper looks at the claim, controversial to this day, that whitman's behavior may have been influenced by his brain tumor. The washington post looks at the arguments on both sides of the \" campus carry \" movement. Out of 15 states to look at the issue last year, texas was the only one that ended up passing a law legalizing it. The ap has made a version of its original 1966 story on the mass shooting available. The guardian speaks to a former newscaster who found himself covering a new kind of horror and to gary lavergne, the university's director of admissions research and the author of two books on the rampage. He recalls that in 1966, his father said: \" that nut is showing everybody what's possible and we're going to see a lot more of this. \" \" i ' ll never forget the way he said that, \" lavergne says. \" and i ' ll be danged if he wasn't right. \"",
