        "summary": "The washington post has rolled out an ominous new slogan â€” \" democracy dies in darkness. \" the phrase, one of bob woodward's favorites, now appears under the paper's logo on its home page and might be introduced to the print version in the weeks to come. Shani george, the post's communications director, tells cbs news that the slogan offers a \" good, concise value statement \" to new readers on snapchat and other platforms. The move has been met with general hilarity among other members of the media, the hill reports. A roundup of reactions: on the late show, stephen colbert quipped that trump will only see the \" goth phase \" motto if it's mentioned on fox, deadline reports. He said the slogan beat other choices such as \" no, you shut up! \" \" excited to announce our new huffpost slogan: the night is dark and full of terrors, \" tweeted huffington post politics editor igor bobic. Commentary magazine editor john podhoretz poked fun at post owner jeff bezos with his suggested slogan: \" democracy dies in darkness but i got this cute little night-light at amazon for just $ 4.99 and it's free shipping because i have prime. \" slate rounds up 15 classic metal albums with titles less dark than the new slogan, including \" welcome to hell \" and \" reign in blood. \" michael mcgough at the los angeles times looks at the history of newspaper slogans. His favorite is the revised version of the pittsburgh post-gazette's \" one of america's best newspapers, \" which pj o ' rourke used for the fictional dacron republican-democrat: \" one of america's newspapers. \" fox news reports that the post denies the motto is a reaction to trump's criticism of the paper and the media in general as \" enemies of the people. \" the blaze pulls together more mockery of the \" melodramatic \" slogan, including the suggestion of \" postseason hopes also die in darkness \" for the post's coverage of dc sports teams.",

Kendra mckenzie gill, who was named miss riverton in june, bryce christopher stone, and two others are still being held in jail on suspicion of detonating an incendiary device, a class three felony, the salt lake tribune reports. Police started getting calls late on friday that people were throwing bombs out of a dark-colored car with a dented front bumper; witnesses told cops that stone drives a similar car. There were nine total explosions in all, targeting two homes and several individuals. Stone's ex-girlfriend lived in one of those homes, and when police picked up stone he named the other three. He characterized the caper as \" pranking \" people with fireworks. The bombs were made of plastic water bottles, aluminum foil, and a \" chemical substance. \" gill was set to compete in the miss utah pageant, notes huffington post; the south valley journal outlines her decidedly un-explosive miss riverton platform, \" fit to be you. \"",

Koco notes she has no family history of the illness and has undergone previous mammograms. The 3d procedure, which the ceo of stillwater medical center says took about seven minutes, allows doctors to view breast tissue in 1mm increments â€” so where they may get just one image from a 2d scan, a 3d scan can produce as many as 50 images from all different angles with just a five-second breast compression. Only two other oklahoma cities ( tulsa and oklahoma city ) have this technology. Noble, one of the first patients to take advantage of it, says she ' ll begin treatment by mid-august.

He died on sept. 7 of multiple organ failure, and at a pre-inquest hearing this week, a potential cause was heard. Greenaway's father did hours of research into his son's death and believes the gardener must have brushed up against aconitum. The deadly flower, also known as devil's helmet, monkshood, and wolfsbane, was indeed growing on the grounds of millcourt house, a $ 6 million estate owned by a retired venture capitalist. A histopathologist testified at the hearing that the flower \" more likely than not \" caused greenaway's death, though it's not clear why he may have come in contact with it. If it's handled without gloves, the flower can cause vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, heart palpitations, and, in severe cases, paralysis of the heart and airways, the telegraph reports. Others testified that the toxin would have caused massive damage to the gardener's internal organs within hours. But a lawyer for his employer isn't convinced, and one problem is that the blood sample taken when greenaway was admitted to the hospital has been destroyed. According to testimony, the plant's toxin wouldn't have been detectable in his blood in as little as 24 hours, making samples taken after his death potentially useless, the independent reports. The bbc notes that aconitum poisoning is rare and typically happens when the plant is eaten; indeed, a canadian actor died after accidentally eating the plant while camping in 2004.

The 29-year-old man was taken to hospital in the western town of schoeppingen, near the dutch border, by the two other men who fled the scene of the explosion in a car, leaving behind condoms and money scattered around the gutted vending machine. The two men told hospital officials that their friend had fallen down the stairs, injuring his head. Suspicious of their story, the officials called the police. During questioning, police said, one of them admitted that the three had blown up the condom machine, and that their cohort was hit in the head by metal as he tried to take cover from the explosion.

The brazilian, whose real name is denis furtado, was arrested on murder charges thursday, four days after the death of a patient. He had been giving butt-enhancement injections to a 46-year-old mother of two, who'd traveled 1,250 miles to his rio de janeiro apartment, when she became sick on saturday. Investigators say furtado took lilian calixto to a hospital, where she suffered four heart attacks and died early sunday, per the afp and bbc. By that time, furtado had disappeared with his mother, maria fÃ¡tima barros, an accused accomplice and fellow doctor, though one with a suspended license, reports the guardian. The pair allegedly drove through a parking lot barrier to escape police on one occasion; both were arrested in rio on thursday. Furtado's girlfriend and receptionist, renata fernandes, is also in custody while police search for a nursing technician. Meanwhile, 45-year-old furtado, who spoke about butt-enhancing treatments using acrylic glass filler, is calling calixto's death a \" fatal accident, \" stressing he's performed 9,000 such procedures in the past. But though medical officials says furtado is licensed to practice medicine in brasÃ­lia and goiÃ¡s, but not in rio, the brazilian plastic surgery society asserts he's not a trained plastic surgeon. \" the growing invasion of non-specialists in the specialty has provoked more and more fatalities like this one, \" it says. Per afp, the society's president adds non-specialists are selling a fantasy to patients who \" are often attracted to low prices, without considering whether or not the conditions are adequate. \" ( this us case is similar. )",

        "summary": "President obama is taking a lot of heat today for dropping his threat to veto a controversial defense bill that could allow the military to capture and indefinitely detain american citizens on us soil. In a fiery editorial, the new york times today called it \" a complete political cave-in, one that reinforces the impression of a fumbling presidency, \" saying it had too many objectionable parts to name. Other criticism has included: andrew sullivan, a longtime obama fan, says the move \" is another sign that his campaign pledge to be vigilant about civil liberties in the war on terror was a lie, \" noting that the president's initial objection to the bill was not that it infringed on americans ' civil rights, but on executive power. Over at salon, glenn greenwald takes an in-depth look at the bill's language, demonstrating that it does indeed codify indefinite detention under the law, expand the scope of the war on terror, and at least leave open the possibility of the military detaining us citizens. We recommend taking a look. \" it's the wrong choice, \" the la times laments, complaining that by sidelining the fbi and civilian courts in terror cases, the bill ignores their \" proven record of success, \" while trampling on the rights of the accused. Obama, who has often advocated those rights, \" should have had the courage of his convictions. \"",

The american heart association says research shows that coconut oil packs more saturated fat than butter and some other oils, usa today reports. \" coconut oil is pure fat, \" writes frank sacks, lead author of the aha's paper. More than 70 % of americans and a third of nutritionists think coconut oil is good for you, per the site health. \" there's no basis at all for that, \" sacks writes. Claims that the white paste was a health food led sacks and his team to examine the existing data. Writing in the aha journal circulation, they found that 82 % of the fat in coconut oil is saturated, far more than in butter ( 63 % ), beef fat ( 50 % ), and pork lard ( 39 % ), per the bbc. They also found nothing in the coconut variety to counter the \" bad effects of saturated fat. \" the ama recommends avoiding saturated fat, found in animal-based sources like lard and butter, which can raise \" bad \" ( ldl ) cholesterol levels. Not all experts agree that is the path to a healthy heart; a 2015 study found people replaced saturated fat with sugar and empty calories, per usa today. Still, the ama recommends switching to plant-based sources like olive oil. For those with stocks of coconut oil, take heart. It still makes a good moisturizer. \" you can put it on your body, but don't put it in your body, \" says sacks.

        "summary": "Day one of bill cosby's retrial on sexual assault charges was markedly different than his first go-round, beginning with a topless protester who barreled toward him outside a pennsylvania courthouse and evident in the prosecution's revelation of what he paid accuser andrea constand to settle her 2005 lawsuit. That amount â€” $ 3.38 million â€” was shared toward the end of the day. The philadelphia inquirer explains that in cosby's first trial, which ended in a mistrial, neither side brought up the suit. Both sides are singing a different tune this time around, with montgomery county district attorney kevin steele arguing in his opening statement the settlement's hefty amount suggests cosby was covering for bad behavior. Cosby's team will present its opening statement tuesday; it's expected to portray constand as a greedy money-seeker. Constand sued after prosecutors opted not to go after cosby in 2005. The payment was made in 2006, reports the ap, and had never before been made public, thanks to a confidentiality agreement. But the judge ruled it was fair game for both sides in this trial. As for the ruckus this morning, the protester has been identified as nicolle rochelle, 39, of little falls, nj. She appeared on four episodes of the cosby show between 1990 and 1992, but has no personal accusations against cosby. She says \" the main goal was to make cosby uncomfortable because that is exactly what he has been doing for decades to women. \" she was charged with disorderly conduct and released.",

        "summary": "In 1793, when acclaimed spanish painter francisco goya was 46, he was bedridden for months with a mysterious illness that brought on headaches, dizziness, hallucinations, and even vision and hearing problems. He eventually recovered and went on to live just past his 82nd birthday, but the illness took his hearing for good, reports live science. With no doctors ' notes and only a description of symptoms, experts have long puzzled over the historic case â€” though syphilis, bacterial meningitis, and lead poisoning ( not exactly uncommon among painters at the time ) have long been considered plausible. Now a leading hearing expert at the university of maryland school of medical says goya may have suffered from a rare autoimmune disease called susac's syndrome. In susac's, one's immune system attacks blood cells in the brain, inner ear, and retina, and can lead to loss of vision and hearing and even psychiatric issues. The painter exhibited this \" constellation of symptoms, \" says dr. Ronna hertzano. \" this required real detective work, \" she says. \" the question of goya's ailment was a fascinating medical mystery. \" still, while syphilis and meningitis are less likely because they tend to be progressive and lead to other complications, she warned ahead of her presentation at the historical clinicopathological conference that \" the best we can do is speculate. \" the annual meeting features an expert ( if armchair ) diagnosis of historical figures that have in the past included vladimir lenin, eleanor roosevelt, and abraham lincoln. Hertzano noted that today goya would have been able to restore his hearing with cochlear implants. ( here's what killed beethoven. )",

He is scheduled for execution wednesday, march 11, 2015 for the ordered murder of a san antonio woman... ( associated press ) huntsville, texas ( ap ) â€” a mexican mafia hit man convicted of beating and strangling a san antonio woman because she didn't pay the gang's 10 percent tax on her illegal drug sales was executed wednesday evening. The injection of manuel vasquez with a lethal dose of pentobarbital leaves texas with enough of the powerful sedative to carry out only one more execution. Vasquez was the fourth texas inmate put to death this year, and at least six are scheduled for execution in the coming weeks. Texas prison officials, like those in other death penalty states, have found it increasingly difficult to find suppliers to provide drugs intended for capital punishment use. Vasquez, 46, was pronounced dead at 6: 32 p.m. Cdt, 17 minutes after the drug began being administered. Vasquez, in a final statement, told his family and friends he loved them and thanked \" the lord",

Editor's note: this story has been updated to reflect the execution. Huntsville â€” a hit man for the mexican mafia gang was executed wednesday night for the 1998 strangling death of a san antonio woman, becoming the fourth inmate to face lethal injection in texas this year. Manuel vasquez was declared dead at 6: 32 p.m., 17 minutes after a lethal dose of pentobarbital was released through an iv into his arm. He was sentenced to death for his role in the murder of juanita ybarra, 51, who had refused to pay gang members a 10 percent street tax on illegal drugs she was selling. Asked if he had a last statement, vasquez, strapped onto a gurney, looked straight up at the ceiling and uttered a brief one. \" i want to say ' i love you'to all my family and friends. Thank you, lord for your mercy and unconditional love. In jesus ' name i pray, amen, \" vasquez said. His sister, mary helen vasquez, cried loudly as she watched her brother take about two dozen breaths before becoming unconscious. She declined to make any statement following the execution. In 1999, jurors convicted vasquez"

        "summary": "Israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu's ruling likud party scored a resounding victory in the country's election, final results showed today, a stunning turnaround after a tight race that had put his lengthy rule in jeopardy. The numbers: with nearly all the votes counted, likud appeared to have earned 30 out of the parliament's 120 seats and was in a position to be able to build a coalition government with its right-wing and religious allies with relative ease. Exit polls were off: recent opinion polls had indicated netanyahu was in trouble, giving chief rival isaac herzog of zionist union a slight lead. Exit polls showed the two sides deadlocked, but once the actual results came pouring in, likud soared and zionist union wound up with just 24 seats. From his mouth: \" against all odds, we achieved a great victory, \" netanyahu told supporters before the final results were in. \" i am proud of the people of israel, who in the moment of truth knew how to distinguish between what is important and what is peripheral, and to insist on what is important. \" what to expect: he staked out a series of hard-line positions in the final days of the campaign â€” notably declaring there would be no palestinian state on his watch â€” and the ap sees his return to power for a fourth term likely spelling trouble for mideast peace efforts and possibly escalating tensions with the us. But the new york times notes this about his past: \" still, mr. Netanyahu has a long history in power and has in the past demonstrated that he can change positions from campaigning to governing. His record is as a pragmatist, analysts said. \" what he ' ll face: reuters notes the palestinians will on april 1 join the international criminal court â€” and may cause a headache for netanyahu in short order.

Macdonald mayor of lewiston it's time for a major overhaul of the many laws and policies dealing with confidentiality, laws that dictate how federal, state and local government are run. A person's medical records, financial statements and other personal information should be blocked from busybodies who seek it out of curiosity. This type of information should remain protected. Recently, a friend asked if it would be possible to locate a gentleman he had known for many years and was now terminally ill. He sought to contact the man with the hope of providing him help and comfort in his final days. I called an organization i felt could locate the man. I was told, correctly, that they could not give out that information. I asked if i left my friend's name and number, could it be passed along to the person if, in fact, they knew him. I was told, again correctly, this would not be possible. I bring this to the reader's attention in an attempt not only to show the foolishness of these laws, but the fear they strike into the average law-abiding citizen. In maine there is a website that lists the pension amounts received by everyone who is issued a monthly check by the state of maine. No privacy here because this is",

Marvel has announced that a black hero â€” longtime cap ally sam wilson, aka the falcon â€” will be taking over his star-spangled mantle in captain america #25, the new york daily news reports. Classic cap steve rogers has been looking for a replacement since being aged into a 90-year-old man in the current storyline ( though, as ign points out, truly plugged-in fans will have known the outcome of that search for a while, thanks to the solicitation for avengers #35 ). Wilson will be familiar to moviegoers thanks to his appearance in captain america: the winter soldier. \" it's about time, \" marvel executive editor tom brevoort said. \" in 2014 this should be a thing that we shrug off, it shouldn't be seen as revolutionary, but it still feels exciting. \" the announcement comes just days after marvel announced a new female thor, and that's no accident, writes andrew wheeler at comics alliance. \" these changes suggest an agenda, \" he writes. \" i'd call it progressive agenda, but it's not. Putting women and people of color in key positions isn't progressive, it's just evidence that superhero comics are slowly catching up to the present day. \"",

        "summary": "An indictment related to the death of a child is always a grim happening, but in the case of anna elizabeth young, it might be the start of something much more awful. The gainesville sun reports the 75-year-old was arrested friday near atlanta in connection with the late 1980s death of a toddler who was allegedly tortured and denied food while in her care. The story is blurry in parts, but what's known is that young ran the house of prayer for all people beginning in roughly 1985 near micanopy, a florida town in alachua county not far from gainesville. Young and her husband, who died in 1988, took in children under the non-profit; a separate sun article suggests kids weren't placed there via social services but accompanied adults who ended up there by way of word-of-mouth references. Cobb county authorities say the situation wasn't an innocuous one. They describe young in a press release as a one-time \" cult leader \" who was in 2001 convicted of child abuse charges related to a 1992 incident in which a 12-year-old girl was burned after young put her in a steel tub containing chemicals; young reportedly fled and was apprehended eight years later, in a relative's attic in illinois. Alachua county sheriff's spokesman art forgey says the death of the toddler, named emon harper, was investigated after the sheriff's office received information, though state attorney bill cervone notes no body has been recovered. Forgey suggests it's not an isolated incident: \" there were numerous children that were beaten, locked in solitary confinement, food withheld, \" he tells wcjb. \" we can document other states and other missing children that we believe are tied into this \" dating back to the ' 60s, he adds, per the sun.",

In several incidents, fights in food courts or other areas of crowded malls led to chaos as rumors spread of shots being fired. A roundup of incidents: in aurora, colo., every on-duty officer in town and officers from neighboring forces were called in to deal with multiple fights and a crowd that grew to 500 people, the denver post reports. Cops say the mayhem began when a crowd surrounded officers trying to arrest somebody suspected of fightingin a mall food court. At least five juveniles were arrested and the town center mall was shut down. The hulen mall in fort worth, texas, was put on lockdown after police investigating reports of gunshots discovered that brawls had broken out involving up to 150 people, reuters reports. A police spokeswoman tells cnn that there was \" chaotic panic and everybody running all at once \" after people thought they heard gunshots at the mills at jersey gardens in elizabeth, nj. The sound turned out to have been a chair being slammed during a fight. Two children, ages 8 and 12, were injured amid the chaos. In memphis, tenn., arrests were made after fights at two malls and reports of gunshots that turned out to be false, the ap reports. \" somebody yelled ' gun! ' and youths stampeded through the mall, \" a police spokesman says. In a very similar incident in fayetteville, nc, there was what the fayetteville observer calls a \" scary level of panic \" at cross creek mall after a fight in the food court led to hundreds of people running through the mall amid unconfirmed reports of gunshots. Officials ended up evacuating and closing the mall. Cleveland.com reports that the beachwood place mall in a cleveland suburb was locked down monday evening and police used pepper spray to disperse a crowd after yet another brawl resulted in pandemonium and false reports of shots being fired.",

Wednesday's apology by candice jackson, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, came on the eve of a series of meetings that her boss, education secretary betsy devos, is holding to examine the impact of the obama administration's stepped-up efforts to hold schools accountable for investigating sexual violence, the ap reports. Jackson was quoted in the new york times on wednesday as saying federal rules have resulted in many false accusations under the law known as title ix.

In her statement of apology, jackson said she was a rape survivor. \" i would never seek to diminish anyone's experience, \" she said. \" what i said was flippant, and i am sorry. \" meanwhile, dem senators are coming down on devos for her approach to campus rape, including her decision to meet with a men's rights group that suggests half of all sexual assault reports are lies, per buzzfeed. \" it is disturbing that the department of education would place these radical groups on the same level as those working tirelessly to confront the crisis of sexual assault on our campuses, \" sen.

        "summary": "The death toll from friday's horrific warehouse fire has risen to 36, making it california's deadliest building fire since the devastation of the 1906 san francisco earthquake. As recovery efforts at the \" ghost ship \" warehouse continue, many are wondering why inspectors failed to act despite repeated complaints that the cluttered building was being illegally used for living and entertainment purposes. Nbc reports that at least 10 complaints were filed over the last 18 years, including a 2007 complaint calling the building \" a nuisance or substandard or hazardous or injurious. \" two of the complaints were filed just last month. Officials say inspectors visited nov. 17, but left after they couldn't get in. A round-up of coverage: some victims trapped in the warehouse were able to text goodbyes to loved ones, the ap reports. Relatives received messages like \" i ' m going to die \" and \" i love you, \" alameda county sheriff's spokesman sgt. Ray kelly told reporters monday, adding that rescue workers found the bodies of some people who were \" protecting each other, holding each other. \" officials say they have identified 33 of the victims and notified 23 families, reports the san francisco chronicle. They say rescue crews, who are searching for evidence of a crime as well as additional victims, believe there may be no more bodies to recover. Investigators believe they have discovered the spot where the fire began, though there is no word yet on the cause. A list of victims can be seen here. Investigators say they have found no sign of fire alarms or sprinklers in the structure, which had been subdivided into a maze of artists'studios and residences. Zac unger, vice president of the local oakland firefighter union, tells the los angeles times that the city is extremely short on fire inspectors. \" had a fire inspector walked into that building and seen the conditions in there, they would have shut the place down, \" he says. The san jose mercury news, which has a diagram of the building's interior showing how much of a death trap it was, reports that interviews with interviews with experts and former ghost ship residents show that the fire danger was ignored by people including the warehouse's owner and city employees. Officials declined to say when the building last received a fire inspection, though it had apparently been quite some time: authorities say fire extinguishers found in the wreckage were inoperative.

The driver, identified as 40-year-old jainer jesÃºs flores vigo, was detained and released, according to newspaper peru21. The lines were scratched into the ground approximately 2,000 years ago and depict animals, plants, imaginary creatures and geometric figures miles long. Nazca's lines and geoglyphs stretch across an area of about 280 square miles. A magistrate concluded that there wasn't sufficient evidence to indicate the driver acted with intent, peru21 reports. Peru's public minister announced that nazca's prosecutor's office was appealing the judge's decision. The ministry had sought nine months of preventive detention and a $ 1,550 fine while the investigation continues, according to the newspaper. The rig left \" deep scars \" across a 50 meter by 100 meter ( 164 feet by 328 feet ) area, the culture ministry said, affecting the surface of the ancient site and damaging three of the geoglyphs. Argentine newspaper clarÃ­n reports that the driver said he didn't know the area because he had never traveled there before and that he left the road because of a mechanical problem. The newspaper speculated that the driver actually drove off the pan-american highway to avoid paying a toll. Unesco says the nazca site is \" the most outstanding group of geoglyphs anywhere in the world and are unmatched in its extent, magnitude, quantity, size, diversity and ancient tradition to any",

Underscoring their differences, the us and russia disagree even on the purpose of the meeting on the sidelines of an annual un summit. The us says it will focus on ukraine, while the kremlin says it will focus on syria and the fight against isis, where there's apparently much to discuss: the new york times reports that us officials were surprised to discover on sunday that russia has joined an anti-isis intelligence-sharing pact with syria, iraq, and iran. In a wide-ranging 60 minutes interview that aired sunday night, putin said russia doesn't plan to put combat troops in syria \" right now, \" but that moscow is considering \" intensifying \" its work with the assad regime and other allies. Putin, a former kgb agent, brushed aside interviewer charlie rose's suggestion that the regime's war crimes were actually helping isis. \" speaking in a professional language of intelligence services, i can tell you that this kind of assessment is an ' active measure ' by enemies of assad. It is anti-syrian propaganda, \" he said. Later in the interview, putin agreed with rose when he said, \" once a kgb agent, always a kgb agent. \" ( he also revealed what he most admires about america. )",

To revamp these hypertension guidelines, last updated in 2004, a 20-person committee looked at almost 15,000 articles revolving around abnormal blood pressure in kids and teens, which is caused by different reasons per age group ( including underlying conditions like kidney disease in infants and little kids, and murkier causes for older kids and teens ).

        "summary": "The widow of the man driving the porsche carrera gt that crashed and killed actor paul walker had hoped to prove that something wrong with the car itself, not the car going too fast, caused the 2013 accident. But a california federal judge on monday dismissed kristine rodas ' wrongful death suit against porsche â€” one of three similar claims â€” saying rodas hadn't proved mechanical issues were to blame for the death of walker and her husband, roger, the los angeles times reports. \" plaintiff has provided no competent evidence that rodas'death occurred as a result of any wrongdoing on the part of defendant, \" judge philip gutierrez said in his ruling, per the ap. An la county sheriff's report said the porsche was driving at a speed between 80mph and 93mph at the time of impact, per cnn. But rodas says her husband was obeying the speed limit, and another lawsuit filed against porsche by walker's daughter, meadow, claims the car was between 63mph and 71mph. What rodas thought was to blame: mechanical problems, including the lack of a crash cage, no safety fuel cell ( a special fuel tank with a stiff outer shell and flexible inner shell to help prevent punctures in a crash ), and a malfunctioning suspension. But the judge found neither of the first two would have mitigated the severe injuries rodas suffered, and the defense's expert testimony about the suspension was dismissed. Walker's daughter's suit â€” which cites different mechanical issues as contributing to walker's death, including a faulty seat belt and an engine capable of letting the car go too fast â€” will continue. \" the issues in the cases are very different, \" her attorney said tuesday, per people. \" [ paul walker ] survived the crash but was trapped and burned to death because of the vehicle's defects. \" there's also one filed by walker's father.",

Neanderthals and a second now-extinct hominid â€” denisovans â€” were living in europe and asia for hundreds of thousands of years before humans arrived and were likely well-adapted to the local pathogens, according to a press release. When humans showed up and started interbreeding, they took on some of the neanderthal and denisovan genes. One of the studies reports three genes having to do with \" innate immunity \" in modern humans show more similarities to neanderthal and denisovan genomes than the rest. Innate immunity is the body's first response to pathogens and other foreign substances, npr reports. The three genes from neanderthals and denisovans \" are key components of innate immunity and provide an important first line of immune defense against bacteria, fungi, and parasites, \" according to the second study. But there's a \" trade-off, \" as researcher janet kelso puts it. \" i suppose that some of us can blame neanderthals for our susceptibility to common allergies, like hay fever, \" she tells npr. That's because these genes that helped ancient humans ward off disease in a new world can cause the body to overreact to minor foreign substances, such as pollen, according to the press release.

We identify a gene set under the strongest selective constraints, mutations in which are likely to predispose individuals to life-threatening disease, as illustrated by stat1 and traf3. We then evaluate the occurrence of local adaptation and detect 57 high-scoring signals of positive selection at innate immunity genes, variation in which has been associated with susceptibility to common infectious or autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, we show that most adaptations targeting coding variation have occurred in the last 6,000 â€“ 13,000 years, the period at which",

A video surfaced showing abc7/kgo-tv sports anchor mike shumann grabbed a jacket belonging to ralph walker, the warriors director of team security ( otherwise known as steph curry's personal security guard ), as shumann exited the at&t center in san antonio following a warriors practice late last week during this first-round playoff series.

The chapters held their spring formals at panama city beach's laketown wharf resort last friday, where the warrior beach retreat for wounded iraq and afghanistan war vets was also taking place, the gainesville sun reports. Fraternity members are accused of spitting on the veterans and their service dogs, tearing magnets and american flags from their cars ( and peeing on one flag ), tossing beer bottles from a balcony onto the veterans, and vomiting onto awnings covering areas where the vets were gathered. \" they knew who [ the veterans ] were and were just getting a kick out of it, \" says retreat founder linda cope, noting that the 60 participants were wearing hats and shirts identifying them as having served. The founder called police, and hotel security got the situation under control ( no police report was ultimately filed ) and evicted the fraternity members the following day. News of the incident went viral when a veteran's wife posted about it on facebook. The fraternity has since sent an apology letter to the organization noting that it's working on figuring out which members misbehaved, and now the president of the university of florida has offered his own apology and promised a full investigation. Emory is also doing an investigation but says that so far no evidence implicates its students; cope tells wjhg she finds that hard to believe. The executive director of the fraternity's national organization says the chapters at both universities are under suspension as the investigations continue, wuft reports.

Steal from their employers at significantly higher rates than workers in other countries, according to the global retail theft barometer released this month by checkpoint systems. While in most countries shoplifting makes up the bulk of shrinkage, in the u.s. The bulk of shrinkage is due to employees stealing from their employers. In layman's terms, shrinkage is the difference between the revenue businesses should have received and the revenue they did receive, and the difference is due in large part to losses from shoplifting, employee theft and vendor/supplier fraud. Indeed, employee theft is responsible for 45 % ( up from 43 % last year ) of shrinkage in the u.s. ( vs. 36 % from shoplifting ). Globally, it's just 39 % from employee theft ( vs. 38 % from shoplifting ). While experts at the global retail theft barometer say it's not clear why employee theft is so high in the u.s. â€” at least compared with other countries â€” they do have information on how these workers steal from their employers.

Researchers including dunbar himself are now reporting in the open access journal arxiv that mobile phone records suggest the layers are pretty much on the money. After analyzing cell phone calls made by 35 million people in 2007 â€” intentionally chosen to predate widespread use of facebook and smartphones â€” the team found people do seem to have, at least on average, four bffs, 11 close friends, 30 acquaintances, and 129 \" others \" in their cohort. \" in this dataset we find strong evidence for the existence of a layered structure, \" they report. \" the clustering yields results that match well with previous studies for the innermost and outermost layers, but for layers in between we observe large variability. \" vice notes that myspace allowed eight slots for best friends, while harry potter had just two, but the researchers didn't sort out the exact nature of each relationship, so it's possible that the four contacts the typical person calls the most includes, for instance, one's parents.

It also raises a whole new set of concerns about \" designer babies. \" to dampen the controversy, the researchers out of sun yat-sen university did not use embryos capable of developing into babies.

Each cycle is slightly different, and predicting the sun's activity has proven difficult thanks to a dynamo caused by fluid deep within the sun. However, after reviewing magnetic field activity over three solar cycles, researchers say they've found a second dynamo close to the sun's surface. \" they both have a frequency of approximately 11 years, although this frequency is slightly different, \" researcher valentina zharkova explains. The new model based on the pair has allowed for \" unprecedentedly accurate predictions, \" per science daily. As if to crush all hope of warmth, zharkova notes they're 97 % accurate. That doesn't mean we're all going to freeze solid. Zharkova explains that, according to the \" double dynamo \" theory, two sets of magnetic waves, \" originating in two different layers in the sun's interior, \" sway between the sun's northern and southern hemispheres. When they are \" in phase... We have strong solar activity. \" but when the \" two waves exactly mirror each other, peaking at the same time but in opposite hemispheres of the sun, \" as is predicted for 2030 to 2040, \" their interaction will be disruptive, or they will nearly cancel each other. We predict that this will lead to the properties of a ' maunder minimum. ' \" the maunder minimum, also known as the little ice age, brought significant temperature drops to the northern hemisphere from 1645 to 1715, causing england's river thames to freeze during the winter of 1683-84, reports the telegraph. Haaretz, which puts the dates at 1300 to 1870, reports some countries suffered crop failure and famine. ( the sun is already partly to blame for our shortening spring. )",

In this process, called \" open-pit \" or \" open-cast \" mining, the initially loose and eventually hard ore material is removed with large hydraulic shovels and ore trucks. Hard rock is drilled and blasted with explosives so the broken material can be removed. When deep, rich ore warrants it, the mining goes underground with vertical shafts descending to horizontal drifts, or passageways that enter the pipe. In bedrock adjacent to the pipe, shafts are sunk and drifts are tunneled into the pipe. The highly mechanized and efficient method known as block caving is shown in the adjacent model. Concrete-lined tunnels are excavated under a large vertical section, perhaps 140 to 180 meters ( 400 to 600 feet ) of kimberlite. Along the tunnels are draw points, or openings in the concrete casing where kimberlite is the open pit at the udachnaya ( lucky ) pipe in sakha republic, russia, has produced many millions of carats of diamond.

        "summary": "The drought in the west is hurting nevada's lake mead in the most obvious sense â€” it's shrinking fast. But that problem comes with an upside: tourism is up as the water recedes and reveals what lies beneath, reports cbs news. The big draw is the ghost town of st. Thomas, which was submerged after the government bought the land in the 1930s to build the hoover dam. The town has been gradually resurfacing over the last decade, so much so that national parks officials plan to put up informational placards for hikers who can now access it on foot, reports the los angeles times. Another popular site requires going under water, just not as far as before: divers are flocking to the wreckage of a b-29 that crashed in 1948. The plane used to lie under 260 feet of water, but \" now it's less than 130 feet down, meaning more light and divers don't need as much technical training, \" a member of a company that leads dive tours tells npr. The plane itself is fascinating, he adds. \" everything in there â€” every control that's inside of it â€” is in its original position. \" ( the crew, which was on a secret mission, survived the crash. ) elsewhere on the lake, a plant used in the construction of the dam sits 50 feet out of the water â€” it used to draw curious divers. While the lake is now at its lowest level since it was created, that means \" you have new beaches, new coves, new things you can explore, \" says a marina owner. All of which helps explain why spring tourism was up nearly 50 % from last year and summer visits were up about 30 % so far.

The mother of two â€” who underwent 59 surgeries, per wcmh â€” instead made it 696 days, dying tuesday at age 33. An official cause of death has not been released. However, officials with the franklin county coroner's office expect an autopsy will show she died as a result of injuries from the attack, which literally melted parts of her body. In fact, prosecutor ron o ' brien is already building a homicide case against malinowski's attacker. In december, michael slager, 42, was sentenced to the maximum 11 years for felonious assault, aggravated arson, and possession of criminal tools. But o ' brien says it was always his office's intention \" to pursue a homicide charge \" if malinowski died. Before her death, malinowski helped inspire judy's law, which would allow for longer sentences in cases where victims are permanently disfigured or incapacitated from the use of an accelerant. The ohio senate is expected to vote on the bill wednesday or thursday, per wsyx. State rep. Jim hughes, who introduced it, tells the dispatch that malinowski refused to take her pain meds when she first met him \" so that she could be her sharpest, at her best, to explain why this legislation was so important. \" hughes calls her an \" inspiration. \" ( this woman was burned alive. )",

Both candidates polled fairly evenly when it came to how voters thought they'd handle the economy, which is overwhelmingly seen as the most important issue. But when asked if they believed obama \" cares about the needs and problems of people like you, \" a majority said he did in all three states â€” the opposite was true for romney. \" romney does have business experience, \" said one respondent. But \" he was in business in order to make a profit. There's nothing wrong with that, but how would that help the country? \" overall, obama is winning by 6 points in ohio and florida, and by 11 points in pennsylvania. The poll also shows that voters in those states strongly support his proposal to raise taxes on households making more than $ 250,000 a year, with support ranging from 58 % to 62 %, and opposition between 34 % and 37 %.
