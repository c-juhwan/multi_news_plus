At the time, hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient australian civilization, sky news reports. Hamm and his team published a study on warratyi this week in nature. The discovery of warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed — or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, science alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

( those who don't are \" simply not qualified \" to weigh in, says mochizuki. ) mathematicians aren't saying that mochizuki's resolution of the theory is wrong, but they're not saying it's right, either. As a result, it's been in a kind of math limbo since 2012, despite attempts by the kyoto university professor as recently as last month to shed light on it. As for the abc conjecture, it's a longstanding math problem that also happens to be \" deceptively complicated, \" explains zme science. \" it roughly states that three numbers a, b, and c, which have no common factor and satisfy a + b = c cannot be too smooth.... In number theory, a smooth number is an integer which factors completely into small prime numbers. \" got that? the upshot, according to both sites, is that the theory raises fundamental questions about the \" nature of numbers, \" and thus its proof would be a major milestone. \" it's a bit disappointing that no one has come out and said it's right or wrong, \" says oxford professor minhyong kim.

What's yours? \" — and this week a federal judge decreed that the mta must comply in order to abide by the first amendment, courthouse news reports. ( there is no \" hamas mtv \"; the ad is actually referencing a music video militants broadcast in the gaza strip. ) the decision won't take effect for a month, in case the agency wants to appeal, the new york times reports. The pro-israel organization in question is pamela geller's american freedom defense initiative, which has previously brought us anti-islam ads in new york and chicago, ads comparing jihadists to \" savages, \" and ads showing a plane about to hit the world trade center. ( the southern poverty law center labels the afdi a hate group, raw story notes. ) the group sued the mta after the \" killing jews \" ads were initially rejected. Though the mta says it fears the ads could be seen as calling for harm to jews, the judge noted that similar ads in chicago and san francisco in 2013 did not result in violence. The ad is a parody of the council on american-islamic relations ' \" my jihad \" campaign, which seeks to frame jihad as a \" personal struggle against sins or temptations \" rather than holy war, the washington times notes.",

La lohan allegedly tried on a pair of diamond earrings on jan. 18, and only removed one — then, after looking around a bit more, started to leave the store with the other one still on, that ear covered by her hair. When confronted by a clerk, lilo \"laughed, admitted to her mistake, and removed the earring. \" tmz notes that this little anecdote could actually help lindsay, proving that she's simply absentminded — because it turns out the actress actually left her own earrings, a more expensive pair, on the counter as she walked out. There are other inconsistencies in the police report that could also help, including details of the store owner's story that have changed. Even so, the gossip site reports that lohan is scared of going to jail and may plead guilty simply so she can get a plea bargain and avoid prison.

Researchers then screened more than 300 white-tailed deer and found the parasite in 41 of them, in roughly half the states studied, science reports. None were in the west, but it was common in the east, particularly in west virginia and virginia.

This is not zika virus. \" the deer's ancestors may have brought the parasite into north america by way of the beringia land bridge millions of years ago, researchers say.

The film is directed and co-written by british anti-vaccination activist andrew wakefield, who was stripped of his medical license for ethics violations, reports the new york times.

Meet geophilus hadesi — or \" hades, \" named for the greek god of the underworld — a subterranean centipede discovered in the velebit mountain range by the croatian biospeleological society, per a press release. The carnivore eats other invertebrates and also shows some longer-than-average legs and antennae ( which help it find prey in total darkness, livescience notes ), as well as jaws filled with poison. But what really makes this \" centipede from hell \" unique is that it's one of \" only two remarkably troglomorphic geophilomorphs hitherto known, \" per the study in zookeys. Translation: it's one of only two centipede species that never leaves its cave dwellings, earning it its alternate title of \" king of the underworld. \" and hades has a queen, too, who never leaves her own underground domicile: geophilus persephones, or \" persephone, \" named for the greek goddess of the underworld, per livescience.

Hades has a couple of features that scientists believe emerged as evolutionary adaptation traits, including long claws at the end of its 33 pairs of legs ( perhaps so it can cling to rocks ) and the ability to withstand the caves ' chilly temps, which can hover in the 30s. How they migrated to these underground dwellings in the first place isn't certain, but the lead author of the study tells livescience that it could have been \" a dramatic change in the outside temperatures and overall conditions that forced less-adaptive organisms to seek shelter underground where the conditions are more stable and less dependent on the outside fluctuations. \" ( a centipede bite could provide more pain relief than morphine. )",

In fact, new evidence that they survived has spawned a history channel special and inspired a retired us marshal to revive the investigation, the new york post reports. \" this is absolutely the best actionable lead we've had, \" says the ex-marshal, art roderick. To recap, three alcatraz inmates — frank morris along with brothers john and clarence anglin — escaped by chiseling a hole into a prison wall and jumping into the cold san francisco bay, with homemade paddles and a raft made from raincoats. Never found, they were presumed dead. But two nephews of the anglins have produced evidence to the contrary: they have christmas cards signed in the names of john and clarence anglin, and roderick matched the handwriting. But the cards are neither stamped nor dated. A photo that will be seen on the show, alcatraz: search for the truth, \" proves the anglins may have been alive in the 1970s, \" says the post. And dna from the dug-up remains of another anglin brother, alfred, does not genetically match a set of bones found on a shore near san francisco in 1963. In a letter, former boston mobster whitey bulger says he met the three men in alcatraz and gave them advice about navigating currents in the bay. \" he taught them that when you disappear, you have to cut all ties, \" says one of the nephews, ken widner. \" he told me,'these brothers undoubtedly had done exactly what i told them to do.

The curious, however, would be well advised to tape this tedious production and fast-forward to the last six minutes, which contain everything they could hope to glean about whether the trio, never found, might have survived the treacherous waters surrounding the prison island. Even allowing for the genre's carnival-barker qualities, the producers have spread about 25 minutes of content over two hours. Told entirely from the perspective of the anglins ( that is, the guys who clint eastwood didn't play in the 1979 movie \"escape from alcatraz \" ), the special is built around information provided by their nephews, ken and david widner, two emotional fellows who are convinced the government has been after the family and that their uncles have been abused by the media. So they enlist a retired u.s. Marshal, art roderick, to help lay out their case, which includes various shreds of evidence that they believe prove the anglins not only navigated the frigid waters but also made it to south america.

Police believe 56-year-old dwight lamon jones, who shot himself at a scottsdale motel early monday, killed all six people in around 96 hours starting early thursday, the new york times reports. Police say jones started the spree when he killed prominent psychiatrist steven pitt, whom he'd been required to see as part of divorce proceedings. On friday, he allegedly killed veleria sharp and laura anderson, two paralegals at the firm his wife used during the divorce. Hours later jones allegedly killed marshall levine, a marriage counselor who used the same office as a counselor jones'son saw during the divorce. Police believe jones also killed mary simmons, 70, and bryon thomas, 72, in fountain hills, around 15 miles away from the other shootings, but their connection to him is still unclear. Jones left around 10 hours of youtube video in which he outlines an alleged conspiracy to steal custody of his son, who's now 21 years old, the arizona republic reports. Ex-wife connie jones says jones was a \" very emotionally disturbed person \" and she divorced him after he hit her and threatened to kill her. She was granted sole custody of their son. The ap reports that jones says her new husband, a retired police detective, was the one who made the connection between the divorce and the shootings and told police of his suspicions.",

The key is a short-chain fatty acid called acetate, which emerges as fiber is digested. Acetate then makes its way to the brain's hypothalamus, where it builds up and triggers chemical reactions that tell us we're full, time reports. Researchers reached this conclusion by scanning the progress of a dietary fiber called inulin through the bodies of mice. Those mice who ate fatty diets rich in inulin gained less weight than mice who didn't eat inulin. But one electrophysiologist not related to the study points out that the mice were fed dietary fiber levels of about 11 %. He tells nature that at such a level, \" the room would be full of mouse farts \" — and perhaps the mice were eating less because they felt gassy. The researchers plan to next test the idea in humans. So could we eventually see an acetate-based diet pill? it's possible, the telegraph suggests: \" the major challenge is to develop an approach that will deliver the amount of acetate needed to suppress appetite but in a form that is acceptable and safe for humans, \" a researcher says.",

Some say kim jong un's wife disappeared after failing to wear one in public. Other versions feature kim il sung, and a rare few show both former leaders. These are only given to high-ranking government officials and military leaders, though ordinary citizens can get a knock-off version from china on the black market. North koreans were even using the pins in place of cash before the workers ' party made it illegal. Police are investigating how the pins got into the flowerbed as possession of such items is illegal in south korea, but say they may have arrived via a propaganda balloon. Meanwhile, pyongyang accuses the south of releasing snakes across the border \" as part of a ' cunning scheme'to challenge our unity, \" reports the guardian. A diplomat also promises action if the war games go ahead as planned, noting the us \" crossed the red line \" when putting kim on a sanctions list.",

        "summary": "Pregnancy affects not only a woman's body: it changes parts of her brain, too, a new study published in nature neuroscience says. The study includes data on 25 spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: a computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the mri scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. ( based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy ). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the ap. What's going on? elseline hoekzema, a study author at leiden university in the netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the mri data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood. One analysis linked brain changes to how strongly a woman felt emotionally attached to her infant.",

After getting bombarded by critics on facebook, lagarde walked back the criticism a bit, notes the new york times. But today, the guardian follows up with more fodder for her critics: lagarde has to pay no taxes at all on her own $ 468,000 salary. \" i suppose we can have a discussion about why international organization employees shouldn't pay taxes, \" writes david dayen at firedog lake. \" but the bigger issue is that lagarde surely knew at the time of making comments about evil tax evaders that she paid no tax on her salary.

Now, another shared experience for the men: strampel, 70, was arrested monday on charges that have not yet been made public. A press conference is scheduled for noon tuesday, reports the lansing state journal. The attorney who represents scores of women who are suing msu praised the attorney general's action, saying \" it demonstrates that he is serious about investigating the systemic misconduct at msu that led to the largest child sex abuse scandal in history. \" strampel stepped down in december citing medical issues; two months later the school initiated the process of firing him. Espn details alleged grievances about strampel that are unrelated to nassar — per msu performance reviews it viewed, he was accused of regularly making sex-related remarks — and also documents his timeline with nassar. Though strampel became dean in 2002, he says his only true interaction with nassar began after a complaint was lodged against the doctor in 2014. No wrongdoing was uncovered by michigan state's title ix office, and so strampel reinstated nassar so long as he followed a new protocol that included stipulations like having a chaperone present during any treatment that occurred near a young patient's genitalia. Strampel says he did not verify nassar was adhering to the rules, and fired him in 2016 after learning he wasn't. Mlive reports 20 women accused nassar of abusing them during that period.",

Now, 11 years later, police may have their man — but they may have had him much sooner if there hadn't been a massive backlog in testing a pile of rape kits. Komo news reports that, among the more than 1,000 kits stockpiled by the seattle police department, was the one that made a dna match to darin bolar at the end of last year, leading to the 52-year-old's arrest on sept. 26. Bolar, a level iii sex offender, already had a rape conviction under his belt from 25 years ago after assaulting another 14-year-old at a theme park. In the beacon hill case, the suspect had first grabbed the girl and raped her in some nearby bushes, then forced a garden hose into her vagina to try to clear out any evidence of the assault, per police reports. He then allegedly took the girl back to his home, where she was beaten, raped, and made to clean his house for the next two days. She finally said to have escaped while the suspect was at work and another man slept on the couch. She was tested immediately for forensic evidence, but that kit wasn't tested until december 2017. The seattle post-intelligencer notes that a $ 3m doj grant was given to the state's ag office in 2017 to help start testing the more than 6,400 untested rape kits across washington. Bolar has been charged with first-degree kidnapping and second-degree rape.",

        "summary": "Hud proposed a federal mandate thursday that has some smokers fuming: a ban against lighting up in public housing nationwide, the new york times reports. If the law passes, more than 3,100 public housing agencies would prohibit smoking in all living units, indoor common areas, administrative offices, and outdoor spaces near those other areas, the washington post notes. The reason: to keep residents safe from secondhand smoke, cut down on fire risks, and curb building maintenance expenses, per the times. \" the argument about secondhand smoke is over, \" hud secretary julian castro tells the paper. \" it's harmful. \" since hud started encouraging public housing groups to implement bans in 2009, more than 600 agencies with at least 228,000 units have gone smoke-free, per the post — but now the federal housing department wants to make it universal. A study by the cdc backs up the economics, predicting that a nationwide ban would result in annual savings of $ 153 million. The group that would feel the biggest burn: the nyc housing agency, the nation's largest public-housing group, with more than 400,000 residents in about 178,000 apartments, per the times. But some worry that, without community support, it will be difficult to enforce, and they don't think the cops should be involved. \" it should be resident-led, \" the chairwoman of the nycha tells the times. Hud says it will listen to public comments on the potential law before making a final decision.",

There's also the question of what defines intelligence: \" of course kids who have parents with more resources to offer ( i.e., good schools, tutors, even high-quality nutrition ) are going to do better when it comes to school and tests.

            "An 18-year-old man thought to have appendicitis ended up being treated for severe internal injuries after an intense paintball game, according to a new case study. The unidentified patient came in with severe abdominal pain, no appetite and fever, which is consistent with appendicitis, according to the case study published today in the bmj medical journal by doctors from university hospital in london. However, after the teen was rushed to the operating room, doctors found that his appendix wasn't the problem and that his liver was lacerated and bleeding into his abdomen. Doctors were able to stop the bleeding by \" repacking \" the liver or applying a special pad and putting pressure on the organ overnight. The liver had to be repacked again the next day until the bleeding finally stopped. After interviewing the patient, doctors discovered he had taken part in a paintball game two days before and reported being hit twice on his lower right-hand side, according to the case study. \" this represents the first report of paintball-related blunt traumatic injury to the liver, \" the doctors wrote in the study. \" solid organ injuries of this nature have only been reported three times previously. \" none of those cases involved liver damage.

The 18-year-old went to the emergency room in august 2015 because of abdominal pain and a low-grade fever, said dr. Joshua luck, a resident surgeon at north middlesex university hospital in london, who treated the patient and is the lead author of the case report. Based on the patient's symptoms, the doctors there diagnosed him with appendicitis.

Michael oreskes, 63, resigned wednesday, per the ap, after two women told the washington post about incidents in the late 1990s when he was the dc bureau chief at the new york times. Both women say while talking to him about possible jobs at the times, he suddenly planted a kiss on their lips and put his tongue in their mouths. When one woman confronted him about it months later, calling it \" totally inappropriate, \" she says he replied: \" i was overcome with passion. I couldn't help myself. \" neither woman was hired; they say they were spurred to come forward by the weinstein allegations. In a statement, npr notes, \" we take these kinds of allegations very seriously, \" though it wouldn't comment on specifics. Meanwhile, npr reports on a current employee now making public her own complaint. Science reporter rebecca hersher says she filed a grievance against oreskes in october 2015 after he turned what was supposed to be a career discussion into a \" three-hour-long dinner that delved into deeply personal territory. \" at that meeting, hersher says, oreskes steered their talk to relationships and sex, even calling one ex-partner his first \" sex girlfriend. \" hersher says oreskes never touched her inappropriately, and she believes he was held \" appropriately accountable \" after her complaint. But she notes the talk made her uncomfortable and \" undercut my confidence in a way that was surprising to me. \" in a statement wednesday, oreske said, \" my behavior was wrong and inexcusable, and i accept full responsibility. \" npr ceo jarl mohn has appointed christopher turpin as npr's temporary news chief, per cbs news.

The circus may also be charged with fraud and cruelty to animals, though the dogs ' owners were able to hold on to the animals, so long as the dogs never masquerade as pandas again.

The find: a 20-inch-high marble sculpture of the head of one adolf hitler, afp reports. \" somebody made an effort to properly hide it, it was buried some [ 2 feet ] underground, \" lech lopuski, a curator at gdansk's national museum, tells the dziennik baltycki website, via the bbc. Inscribed on the bust is \" thorak 1942, \" designating it as the work of josef thorak, who was known as one of the fuhrer's favorite sculptors, per afp. \" it's an important sculpture because we didn't know it existed, \" lopuski notes. \" thorak was a gifted sculptor, and we can see that he did a good job. \" thorak's works were known to be monumental, designed for use in official buildings and public spaces, per the bbc. While museum officials still aren't sure how this hitler head ended up in the garden — and remained hidden for 70 years, even when work was done to install a new fountain and flower beds, lopuski says — there's been speculation it was buried in 1945, just before the soviet army infiltrated gdansk. Lopuski theorizes the sculpture may have been part of the furnishings for the office of the museum director at the time, per afp. But just because the hitler head was found on museum grounds doesn't mean it will be up for display anytime soon. \" for the time being, it goes to a warehouse, \" the museum's director says, per the bbc. \" it needs to be studied scientifically to find out who ordered it, where it stood, and how it ended up in the museum. \" lopuski adds, per afp: \" it's a delicate issue. \" ( hitler's long-lost bronze horses were just found in may. )",

        "summary": "Bernie sanders rolled out his vision to overhaul the health care system on wednesday, one in which everybody would get their insurance from the government through medicare instead of through their jobs or a private insurer. Sanders calls it the medicare for all act of 2017, but you ' ll also hear phrases such as \" single payer \" and \" universal health care \" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the wall street journal. Coverage: the basics: per cnn, everybody gets a \" universal medicare card, \" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the ap. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A ' right ': sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the new york times. \" guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the american people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the american people want. \"'single payer ': david leonhardt of the new york times has a q&a on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \" single payer \" means. In short, it \" describes a system in which only one entity — the government — pays medical bills. If all americans had medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system. \" vox says sanders'system is far more generous than single-payer plans in canada and elsewhere. The cost: this could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the journal. Details are yet to come, but sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \" no one — including sanders — has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support, \" writes mike allen at axios. Litmus test? by all accounts, the chances of it passing a gop-controlled congress are precisely 0 %. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for democrats, reports the washington post.

Despite blanketing the area with ads, the companies lost saturday's vote on proposition 1 by 56 % to 44 %, reports engadget, which notes that the companies were also fighting to be able to pick up passengers in traffic lanes. Mayor steve adler says he wants uber and lyft to stay in austin, but the companies say they are \" disappointed \" and they need to \" take a stand. \" uber says the withdrawal will leave around 10,000 people out of work. The uber and lyft spend on the campaign worked out to around $ 223 for every vote they received, making it the most expensive campaign in city history. The previous record, adler's 2014 election campaign, cost only a seventh of what they spent on the proposition 1 fight.

Researchers in switzerland were inspired by the bombardier beetle, which shoots out a gas that can burn skin, the atlantic reports. The beetle's mechanism works by mixing two chemicals normally kept separate in its abdomen. When under attack, the beetle combines the hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone to spray its attack gas. The researchers copied this system by putting hydrogen peroxide and manganese dioxide side-by-side, separated by only a lacquer. Break that lacquer, and you get the reaction. Atm makers could employ the principle in their machines by rigging them to ooze foam if someone begins tampering, say the researchers. Instead of burning acid, the atms could cover bills with dye and dna, making the cash hard to use and easy to track. \" thieves may be able to run, \" notes gizmodo, but \" it's getting much harder for them to hide. \" in fact, the mechanism \" could be used anywhere you find things that shouldn't be touched, \" a researcher tells eth zurich — whether to fight vandalism or keep animals off crops.

The actor reached out to woody allen's daughter wednesday to apologize for starring in her father's mighty aphrodite — for which she won an oscar — while ignoring farrow's claims of sexual abuse against allen. Farrow was 7 when she said allen sexually touched her, and a judge later found her claims credible, though allen has continually denied the allegations, vulture reports. Sorvino says she was aware of farrow's claims when she made mighty aphrodite but dismissed them \" as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle \" because of her lifelong love of allen's work. \" it is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career's existence, \" she writes. Sorvino says her experience opening up to farrow's brother, reporter ronan farrow, about harvey weinstein made her want to learn more about dylan farrow's allegations, which led to her taking those allegations seriously. Sorvino says her love of allen's work \" does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because i wanted desperately for it not to be so. \" she says she won't work with allen again, writing: \" we are in a day and age when everything must be re-examined. This kind of abuse cannot be allowed to continue. If this means tearing down all the old gods, so be it. \" sorvino isn't the first actor to denounce allen.

        "summary": "It seems americans are safest from gun-related injuries and deaths when thousands of gun owners are busy attending the nra's annual convention, ars technica reports. An analysis published thursday in the new england journal of medicine found gun-related injuries dropped 20 % nationwide during annual nra conventions between 2007 and 2015 and 63 % in the states hosting the conventions. These reductions were seen despite no corresponding reduction in crime rates. The biggest drop in gun injuries was for men living in states with high levels of gun ownership in the south and west. \" the drop in gun injuries during these large meetings attended by thousands of well-trained gun owners seems to refute the idea that gun injuries stem solely from lack of experience and training in gun use, \" analysis author dr. Jena anupam tells cnn. Jennifer baker, the director of public affairs for the nra, says the analysis \" is another example of when data and numbers fly in the face of logic and common sense. \" but the chair of emergency medicine at the medical college of wisconsin tells reuters it \" passes the sniff test. \" \" it makes sense that decreased exposure and decreased usage would result in fewer events, \" says dr. Stephen hargarten, who wasn't involved in the analysis. Anupam says it's possible nra conventions have an outsize impact on gun injuries and deaths because attendees are the most intense users of guns. So it's good news for the safety of americans then — at least for the few days of the year when there's an nra convention — that time is reporting a spike in nra memberships in the wake of the parkland shooting and ensuing conversation about gun control.",

Two georgia men arrested last week allegedly wanted to save them by shooting up an alaska research facility that has been at the center of multiple conspiracy theories. Det. Michael vickers tells the alaska dispatch news the men — 30-year-old michael mancil and 22-year-old james dryden jr. — claim \" that god told them to go and blow this machine up that kept souls, so souls could be released. \" some conspiracy theorists believe the high frequency active auroral research program, or haarp, can control people's minds and the weather. Vickers tells the atlanta journal-constitution that mancil believes it keeps people's souls from getting to heaven. Last week's arrest of mancil and dryden started with an investigation into mancil for allegedly dealing drugs, walb reports. Georgia authorities believe the men were bound for alaska when they were arrested last thursday in south georgia. Sheriff doyle wooten says the men had an \" arsenal \": four ar-15 rifles, four handguns, another rifle, thousands of rounds of ammo, and two flak jackets. Vickers tells the dispatch news the men planned \" to try to find a scientist, to steal his car and id badge to gain access. \" a spokesperson for the university of alaska fairbanks, which took over haarp from the government in 2014, says they've had threats before but nothing \" quite this extreme. \" haarp researches earth's ionosphere, which has an impact on communication and navigation systems.",

That fact didn't stop steve aisthorpe of scotland from his recent mission on the nepal-tibet border: to get \" closure \" on the fate of kristinn runarsson and thorsteinn gudjonsson, friends and fellow climbers who vanished during a 1988 expedition with him. Aisthorpe, who the guardian notes found out just a few weeks ago his friends ' bodies had been seen at the end of a glacier on pumori mountain, recalls on the church of scotland's website how his group started as four climbers in october of that year, though one of the men fell ill early on and dropped out. Aisthorpe, then 26, came down with the flu, and so he climbed back down on oct. 16, 1988, to seek medical attention. When aisthorpe realized he was in no condition to attempt the climb, he sent a message back to runarsson and gudjonsson, both 27 and from iceland: \" feel free \" to go for the summit without him. The two men were never seen alive again after oct. 18. When aisthorpe finally felt well enough to head back to the last camp where he'd left his friends, \" my calls echoed from the rocks and ice before fading. … the silence was palpable. \" fast-forward 30 years, when an american climber spotted their bodies just last month; a group of local climbers brought the remains down. Among those at the cremation ceremony in kathmandu for the men was runarsson's 30-year-old son; runarsson's fiancee had been pregnant when the father of her child was lost to pumori. More on their tale here. ( two highly experienced climbers died on el capitan over the summer. )",

North charleston's city council voted unanimously on thursday to settle with walter scott's family for $ 6.5 million, the new york times reports. A city attorney tells the post and courier that they're proud they could \" settle a case of this magnitude without a brick being thrown, without a fire being set, and without a lawsuit being filed. \" he says the city took the $ 6.4 million settlement in the freddie gray case and the $ 5.9 million settlement in the eric garner case into account during negotiations. As part of the settlement, scott's family has agreed not to sue the city or its employees, the times notes. The city lawyer says that while the payment is large, there was the potential for \" a very large verdict \" if the case went to court because there's video of the shooting and former officer michael slager has been charged with murder. \" it's historic, \" an attorney for the scott family tells the washington post. \" it sets a good precedent for a city not tolerating this sort of behavior from police officers. \" anthony scott, walter scott's brother, says the settlement ensures that scott's four children will be taken care of financially, and a portion of it will be donated to the red cross to help flood victims in the state, the post and courier reports.

It says trostle and wife krystsina opted to ride the raging rapids water ride, which is supposed to mimic a white-water rafting trip, even after noticing the ride's water was \" dirty, stagnant and sludge-like \" and its waterfall wasn't running. The ride typically splashes riders at the end, reports triblive, and in trostle's case, he said the water hit his left eye — and then the trouble allegedly began. Per the suit, the eye reddened, became sensitive to light, and itchy and painful, reports the post-gazette. He was initially diagnosed with acute conjunctivitis. Antibiotics didn't rectify the situation, and on july 14 he was diagnosed with microsporidia keratitis. The suit says microsporidia is a \" harmful parasite that eats away at the cornea of the eye, \" and alleges it was in the ride's water.

Cnn reports on irma, currently a category 3 hurricane that experienced \" rapid intensification \" from wednesday into thursday, meaning its wind speed ramped up at least 35mph in that period — though the national hurricane center on thursday noted the \" remarkable \" increase measured 58mph. A national hurricane center alert issued early friday pegs maximum sustained winds at 115mph, with higher gusts. The storm is expected to approach the caribbean by tuesday or so as a category 4 storm, then possibly the us — though meteorological models with wildly different scenarios show it's too early to make any definitive predictions on where the storm will land. Irma is what's called a \" cape verde \" hurricane, meaning one that forms off the coast of africa then shoots across the atlantic; cnn notes these storm systems can turn into particularly powerful ones ( hurricane hugo is one example ). What's emboldening irma is a lack of the \" hurricane kryptonite \" known as wind shear, which often acts to tamp down hurricanes. A powerful high-pressure ridge is pushing irma westward and keeping wind shear low. What one of the models is showing that has some concerned, per reuters: irma could head straight into the gulf of mexico, which could be bad news for areas still struggling after harvey. \" all interests in the eastern caribbean will need to monitor the progress of this evolving and dangerous hurricane, \" an accuweather hurricane expert notes, reiterating he can't say \" with certainty \" how the us will be affected.",

Facebook has pledged to buy some 650 of those patents, or $ 550 million worth. In the deal, facebook also gets a license to microsoft's portion of the portfolio. According to facebook's announcement, microsoft ends up with 275 aol patents, plus licenses to facebook's aol patents and the 300-ish patents aol didn't sell. \" today's agreement with facebook enables us to recoup over half of our costs while achieving our goals from the aol auction, \" says a microsoft rep. For facebook, it's \" another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect facebook's interests over the long term, \" says a spokesman. What do outsiders say? \" the deal is a further sign of the growing importance of stockpiling patents in the arsenal of any big technology company, \" writes nick wingfield for the new york times. \" it also shows how microsoft and facebook have gravitated increasingly closer to each other in large part because of a common enemy: google. \" writing for zdnet, emil protalinski says it's actually all about yahoo, not google. \" with public companies like yahoo targeting it for patent infringement, the social networking giant has stepped up its game. I don't believe it's a coincidence that aol and yahoo are such similar companies. This is exactly why facebook is so interested in aol's patents: a lot of them cover technologies that facebook uses, as well technologies used by companies that want to sue facebook. \"",

Prosecutors said he used the $ 100,000 or so he made from selling the gold to ottawa gold buyers to buy a house in jamaica and a boat in florida. Investigators, first alerted by a suspicious bank teller, found vaseline and rubber gloves in lawrence's work locker. In his safe deposit box at a bank, they discovered four unsold gold pucks, which had about the same diameter as a golf ball and matched the size of the ladle lawrence used to test gold at the mint, radio canada international reports.

The company announced wednesday that it \" will not invest in next generations of traditional ford sedans for north america. \" in a financial release, ford said that it plans to transition to just two cars over the next few years: the ford mustang and the new ford active, a \" crossover \" vehicle to be released next year. Ford currently sells the fiesta, focus, fusion, c-max, mustang, and taurus sedans and coupes in north america reports techcrunch, which notes that the lincoln sedans are also expected to vanish. Ford hasn't said exactly when the taurus and other models will be phased out, but the company's statement says almost 90 % of its north america portfolio will be trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles by 2020. Auto industry experts say the move is a bold one, but not totally unexpected, given the continuing shift among consumers away from cars and toward suvs. \" ford's announcement to pretty much get out of the car business... Comes as no surprise, \" says analyst michelle krebs, per the detroit free press. \" ford's car sales have been dismal for the past couple of years, and there's no end in sight to the decline of traditional cars. \"",
