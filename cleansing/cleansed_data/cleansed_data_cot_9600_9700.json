The man's supervisor in food service at the university of maryland eastern shore visited the princess anne home after he didn't turn up for work saturday, but no one answered the door, the daily times reports. She filed a missing person report and police discovered the bodies of rodney todd, 36, and five girls and two boys, aged 6 to 16, alongside a generator that was out of gas. There was no power to the home due to an unpaid bill, relatives say. \" to keep his seven children warm, [ todd ] bought a generator, \" his stepfather tells the ap. \" it went out and the carbon monoxide consumed them. \" the official cause of death hasn't been determined, but no foul play is suspected.

But the head of an american academy of pediatrics injuries committee tells npr the walkers are \" inherently dangerous objects that have no benefit whatsoever, \" and that he thinks they should be banned. Dr. Benjamin hoffman's remarks represent a reinvigorated movement to stop the manufacture and sale of the wheeled walkers in the us, and that mission is backed by a new study published monday in the journal pediatrics. The study found that, between 1990 and 2014, more than 230,000 kids younger than 15 months ended up in ers after using a walker. More than 90 % of the injuries were to the head and neck, cbs news notes. \" there's absolutely no reason these products should still be on the market, \" study author gary smith tells npr. The reason they've been deemed a hazard is that little ones can zip along at too-fast speeds: one estimate says they can propel themselves 4 feet in just one second, meaning they may end up in dangerous situations before adults can catch up, like falling down stairs, burning themselves by pulling pots off of stoves, and plummeting into pools. Federal safety standards, including walker brakes, put into place eight years ago led to a big drop in injury numbers — a 23 % decrease in the four years after the standards were implemented — but researchers say people may also not be using walkers as much anymore, and that thousands of kids still get hurt each year. \" despite the decline in injuries, infant walkers remain an important and preventable source of injury among young children, \" the study notes.

The boston globe reports that white house staffers routinely write trump's tweets for him, mimicking his style as best they can. That the president doesn't write all of his own tweets isn't a huge revelation, but the globe story has details on the process: staffers will give the president a few sample tweets in a memo, and while they deliberately include syntax and grammatical errors, and probably an exclamation point or two, the faux-trump tweets do not deliberately include typos. The president then picks the tweet he likes best and sends it out himself, sometimes with modifications. \" some staff members even relish the scoldings trump gets from elites shocked by the trumpian language they strive to imitate, believing that debates over presidential typos fortify the belief within his base that he has the common touch, \" writes annie linskey. Some giveaways: tweets with photos, videos, or hashtags are probably not from trump. The globe suggests it's getting harder to tell the difference between trump and non-trump tweets, and andrew mcgill of the atlantic has created a trumpornotbot to help judge. For instance, on the melania trump tweet mentioned earlier, the bot thinks there's just a 25 % chance trump wrote it himself, notes mashable.",

In self/less, he plays the younger form of a wealthy powerbroker who swaps his cancer-riddled body for a newer model and a second chance at life. What critics are saying: self/less has an interesting premise, but \" degrades it by turning it into a generic thriller, and finishes it off with a rushed, disjointed ending, \" writes james berardinelli at reelviews. He says the flick is overflowing with material, but is too rushed and seriously lacking in character development. It's \" too badly made to entertain audiences in search of escapist entertainment and too insulting for viewers hoping for more, \" berardinelli concludes. \" any hope reynolds had of reviving his stardom with self/less is as fruitless as thinking a person can swap bodies without consequence, \" writes peter howell at the toronto star. He calls the acting \" bloodless, which is appropriate to the theme, i suppose. \" as for director tarsem singh, \" he seems singularly uninspired — a chase scene on a highway looks like a bunch of hollywood stuntmen demonstrating how they do chase scenes. \" \" singh once seemed an original, but self/less doesn't have a distinctive bone in either of its bodies, \" writes mark jenkins at npr.

Self/less also \" raises provocative questions about identity and then doesn't think about them at all. \" ann hornaday's take: just, no. Self/less is \" a tiresome game of cat and mouse, padded with cliched fight scenes, car chases, and shootouts, \" that \" bears not a trace of singh's signature visual richness, \" she writes at the washington post. \" reynolds does his dogged best to look serious and sincere, but he can't rescue a film that flounders almost from its first moments. \" this flick \" could just as easily have been called brain/less, pulse/less, and point/less. \"",

The film, from director tarsem singh ( whose most recent credit was the snow white-inspired mirror mirror ), is instructive in illustrating the cavalier and unsatisfying way hollywood often takes intriguing ideas and debases them by forcing them into familiar narrative structures. There's enough material in self/less to fuel a mini-series. Instead of letting the story breathe, the film rushes along at breakneck speed, using contrivances and \" shortcuts \" in failed attempts at character development. The film opens with ben kingsley ( in full ming the merciless mode ) playing a wealthy new york city powerbroker who is afflicted with an aggressive form of cancer. Eager to avoid the embrace of the grim reaper, he accepts the offer of geneticist professor albright ( matthew goode ), who claims he can transplant the content of damian's mind into a younger, healthy body ( ryan reynolds ).

The film, from director tarsem singh ( whose most recent credit was the snow white-inspired mirror mirror ), is instructive in illustrating the cavalier and unsatisfying way hollywood often takes intriguing ideas and debases them by forcing them into familiar narrative structures. There's enough material in self/less to fuel a mini-series. Instead of letting the story breathe, the film rushes along at breakneck speed, using contrivances and \" shortcuts \" in failed attempts at character development. The film opens with ben kingsley ( in full ming the merciless mode ) playing a wealthy new york city powerbroker who is afflicted with an aggressive form of cancer. Eager to avoid the embrace of the grim reaper, he accepts the offer of geneticist professor albright ( matthew goode ), who claims he can transplant the content of damian's mind into a younger, healthy body ( ryan reynolds ). Once the transition is complete, damian discovers all is not smooth sailing. Not only is the new body trying to reject the implanted thoughts and memories but the identity of its previous inhabitant is in danger of re-emerging. Indeed, prodded by visions, damian searches out his former \" wife",

They can buy fresh bodies when the old ones wear out. Well, at least they can in self/less, a movie that raises provocative questions about identity and then doesn't think about them at all. In this sci-fi fantasy, rebottling your soul in a new vessel begets not contemplation but chase scenes. Lots of chase scenes. That's surprising only because the thing was directed by tarsem singh, whose resume includes such nutty but singular fables as the cell and the fall. Singh once seemed an original, but self/less doesn't have a distinctive bone in either of its bodies. The movie begins in a demimonde so garishly opulent that it was partly filmed in trump tower. Played by ben kingsley with a new york accent the size of the bronx, damian is a wealthy real estate developer with terminal cancer. He's not too busy dying, however, to forgo having a young competitor to lunch so he can humiliate him.

It potentially damningly found he had been shot eight times, mostly in the back. On tuesday the official autopsy was released, and it tells a different story. The sacramento county coroner's office found seven bullets, not eight, hit the 22-year-old, and that six didn't enter his back, as omalu found: rather, three hit there, plus another three that struck his right side and one that entered his left leg, reports the new york times. Kcra quotes coroner kimberly gin's report as saying that sacramento authorities asked four forensic pathologists to read the autopsy and give an assessment due to the \" erroneous information \" that came out of the private one. Dr. Gregory reiber was one of them and says omalu's findings contained a \" significant error \": that an exit wound on clark's left side was an entry wound. This \" leads to incorrect conclusions regarding the relative positions \" of clark and the police, says reiber, who says the official autopsy does \" not support the assertion that clark was shot primarily from behind. \" he adds that the bullet that hit the front of clark's left thigh was \" most likely \" the first bullet that struck him as he \" was walking toward the officers ' position, \" reports the sacramento bee, seemingly backing up officers'story that clark was coming toward them with what they thought was a gun; it turned out to be a cell phone. Omalu swung back at reiber's statements: \" i find it extremely unusual that an outside doctor is reviewing an autopsy report and is coming out to state [ i ] am wrong.

The investigation doesn't rule out terrorism or mechanical failure in the march 8 disappearance, but investigators haven't been able to build a case against anyone else on the flight. If intentional human action took down the plane, the circumstantial evidence points only to captain zaharie shah, 53, the times'report suggests. For example: on his flight simulator, shah charted a route that would see a plane land on an unnamed island in the south indian ocean, the telegraph reports. The route was deleted from his simulator but retrieved by computer experts. Shah was \" unique among those on board the flight \" for having no planned commitments, personally or professionally, after mh370 was scheduled to land, the independent reports. Some have also speculated that shah's home life was deeply troubled, but his family denies it, australia's news network reports. In fact, friends and family have described him as a warm and pleasant person, interested in social work, who had volunteered for a mainstream political party and opposed muslim extremists. His family has said they believe the truth will only come out when the flight's black box is retrieved. ( for more, see how family members are being compensated for the disaster. )",

            "What happens when \"a reclusive writer who spends hours identifying new constellations in the ceiling paint \" agrees to go on an okcupid date with \"a wildly energetic university professor \"? well, if they're two twentysomethings who share an overly robust sense of whimsy, the date turns into a spontaneous three-week trip around the world, which turns into a salon essay and then into a big-time hollywood movie. Variety reports that clara bensen's essay \"the craziest okcupid date ever \" is being adapted into a rom-com called no baggage. The movie sounds like the final nail in the genre's coffin, but at the very least this means our crappy okcupid dates have the potential to become something more than a pile of misery. Hey, hollywood: my craziest okcupid date was when the guy said he was five foot eight but turned out to be five foot two. I left after two-thirds of a drink and went home and ate a pint of ice cream even though i ' m lactose intolerant. Get at me.",

        "summary": "Most people know that jelly beans contain sugar. A california woman, however, says she was left in the dark and now wants retribution. Jessica gomez says she purchased jelly belly's sport beans — advertised as a supplement for carbohydrates, electrolytes, and vitamins — believing the candy had a lot less sugar than it actually does. Sugar, she notes, was not listed in the candy's ingredients. Only later did she realize that \" evaporated cane juice, \" which was listed, was essentially the same thing, reports forbes. Now, in a class-action lawsuit, gomez argues jelly belly's omission of the word \" sugar \" from the label was a deliberate attempt by the company to deceive consumers. And munchies notes she's backed up by fda guidelines on the matter. Last year, the fda stated that \" juice \" on a label should only be used to refer to juice from a fruit or vegetable because replacing the word \" sugar \" with \" evaporated cane juice \" is indeed deceptive. However, the fda wrote that the guideline \" does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding of fda or the public. \" jelly belly describes gomez's suit as, in a word, \" nonsense. \" in a motion to dismiss filed in april, the company says \" no reasonable consumer could have been deceived by sport beans ' labeling \" since \" the product's sugar content \" is clear on the label. It adds \" the plaintiff does not explain why an athlete — or anyone — would be surprised to find sugar in a product described as ' jelly beans.

Jeb bush \" finds himself in a unique and difficult position \" as he tries to set himself apart from his kin, a previous post article mentions. He hopes to do that in his address today before the chicago council on global affairs, in which he's expected to acknowledge how \" lucky \" he is with two oval office alums in his ear, but also explain how he ' ll forge his own path to strengthen the us as a world leader and reinvigorate weakened relationships in the middle east, europe, and latin america. Bush's statements also take on the economy, the current administration ( \" hashtag campaigns replace actual diplomacy and engagement \" ), and the military: \" the president's word needs to be backed by the greatest military power in the world.

Airport officials and local authorities report that around 8pm local time, a 29-year-old ground service agent with horizon air stole a 76-seat turboprop from sea-tac international airport, took to the skies, and may have even done stunts above puget sound as military f-15 jets flew after him, cnn and abc news report. After about an hour in the air, the passenger-less plane crashed on ketron island, about 40 miles away from the airport. The pierce county sheriff's department said the unidentified pilot, whom it called \" suicidal, \" was pronounced dead after the crash, and that the crash wasn't caused by the military jets. As the situation unfolded, air traffic controllers could be heard trying to guide the man safely back down to the ground. \" yeah, i ' m not quite ready to bring it down just yet, \" the pilot, referred to by controllers as rich or richard, said as they tried to get him to land at a nearby military airfield ( you can hear audio at the seattle times. ) \" those guys will rough me up if i tried landing there.... This is probably jail time for life, huh? \" at one point, the pilot refers to himself as a \" broken guy, got a few screws loose, i guess, \" per the washington post. Sheriff paul porter says the act wasn't terrorism. \" most terrorists don't do loops over the water, \" he tells abc. \" this might have been a joyride gone terribly wrong. \" his office tweeted it couldn't be sure if what the pilot was doing was stunts or a \" lack of flying skills \" before the plane went down. The ceo of alaska airlines, which owns horizon air, expressed sadness for the family of the pilot and said the airline is working with the faa, fbi, and ntsb to investigate what happened.",

        "summary": "In what is being called a first since 1889, a large-scale, government sanctioned bare-knuckle boxing event took place in wyoming on saturday night and things got bloody. Per usa today, a sold out crowd of 2,000 people in cheyenne watched as 10 bouts played out before them with fighters protected only by a little gauze around the palm. An even larger audience likely tuned in via pay-per-view to see the fights, including four heavyweight bouts. Fighters came from several backgrounds including boxing, ufc and mma. The quickest knockout occurred when sam shewmaker used one punch to send eric prindle to the canvas 18 seconds into their heavyweight bout. \" it felt like hitting a home run, \" shewmaker told the ap., a fourth-generation stone mason from the tiny central missouri town of gravois mills. \" i didn't think i would be able to catch him that early, but luckily i did. \" in the only female fight of the night, 29-year-old bec rawlings from brisbane, australia stopped alma garcia with a tko in the second round. Rawlings and her fellow combatants were all eager to become the first to take off the gloves for a large-scale event since july 8, 1889, when john l. Sullivan went 75 rounds to beat jake kilrain. Even that event was illegal and had to be staged under the cover of secrecy as most states had outlawed the non-gloved version of boxing. Fighting was forced underground until 2011, when a yavapai nation sanctioned a match that drew more than a million viewers. The promoter of that event and saturday's, david feldman, realized there was a hungry market for bare-knuckle fights. Wyoming has since become the first state to sanction and regulate the sport.",

The protesters in arizona parked vehicles sideways on shea boulevard, blocking both lanes of traffic into fountain hills, where trump held a rally saturday afternoon, maricopa county sheriff's office deputy joaquin enriquez told cnn. Enriquez described shea boulevard as the main artery into the area and the protesters ' actions were causing motorists to drive into oncoming traffic as they tried to get around them. Traffic was backed up for miles due to the blockage. \" this is causing huge issues for us, \" enriquez told cnn. He added, \" we obviously have to get this road open. \" enriquez later told cnn that three protesters were arrested and two cars were towed from the boulevard. The deputy emphasized that the arrests were due to protesters blocking the roadway, not because of the protest itself. Protests at trump rallies increasingly have become more contentious in recent days.

            "Washington ( cnn ) dozens of protesters blocked traffic near a donald trump event in arizona on saturday, while demonstrators marched in new york city to protest the gop front-runner. The protesters in arizona parked vehicles sideways on shea boulevard, blocking both lanes of traffic into fountain hills, where trump held a rally saturday afternoon, maricopa county sheriff's office deputy joaquin enriquez told cnn. Enriquez described shea boulevard as the main artery into the area and the protesters ' actions were causing motorists to drive into oncoming traffic as they tried to get around them. Traffic was backed up for miles due to the blockage. \" this is causing huge issues for us, \" enriquez told cnn. He added, \" we obviously have to get this road open. \" enriquez later told cnn that three protesters were arrested and two cars were towed from the boulevard. The deputy emphasized that the arrests were due to protesters blocking the roadway, not because of the protest itself. Protests at trump rallies increasingly have become more contentious in recent days. Friday night, protesters outside a trump rally in salt lake city, utah, tried to breach the venue's doors, causing police officers and secret service officers to abruptly shut them as trump was speaking.

        "summary": "Sure, americans chow down on about 280 pounds of meat each per year, compared to the 181 pounds in your average developed country. But chances are those 280 pounds come from the same three or four meat-producing animals: chicken, beef, pork, and maybe a little turkey. While north america has long had plenty of edible land animals, ranging from deer to squirrels, that doesn't translate to much in the way of menu choice for carnivores. The reason for that has a lot to do with the history of the meat industry in the us, lauren davis explains at io9. Westward expansion allowed the growth of cattle ranching at a time when cities like new york and chicago needed to feed surging populations. Meanwhile, european cattle suffered from a virus that forced europeans to turn to the us for their beef. Packers shipped huge amounts of the stuff to consumers. Deer ranching, by contrast, didn't take off, and required federal inspections for venison are much harder to come by. But while pretty much all poultry \" tastes like chicken \" in the us, the technician notes that the chinese have included pigeon and quail in their domestic poultry industry; geese and duck are common elsewhere. Another part of america's diversity problem? a simple lack of recipes that include more exotic meats. Click for davis ' full piece.",

And just this month, florida was ranked second in the us in school shootings since sandy hook two years ago, trailing only neighboring georgia, reports miami new times. Given the state is so gung-ho about guns, broward/palm beach new times has come up with a list of 7 ways floridians have accidentally shot themselves since 2012: one man managed to fire his weapon in his pants while launching a bowling ball, injuring his leg. A husband somehow shot himself in the face while threatening one of his wife's 13 collies, killing himself. A cop literally shot himself in the foot while finishing up his meal at a restaurant with friends. Next up is the man who decided to play russian roulette and, well, shot himself doing it. Another man shot himself in the hand and his buddy in the arm while they were cleaning their guns. And we can't leave off the teenager who nailed himself in the penis and left testicle while cleaning his gun. Finally, jose canseco gets a nod for shooting his own middle finger off while cleaning his semiautomatic pistol. Last year, a florida woman pulled a gun on walmart employees when they wouldn't take her coupon. ( and, rejoice: florida has now passed new york in population. )",

Confirm the identity, we are absolutely heartbroken to announce that the body appears to be that of 8-year-old madyson middleton, \" the department said in a statement, per usa today. The tragic find comes after a massive search that involved the fbi, a copter crew, k9 units, and a couple hundred residents who searched and posted messages on social media and in fliers, kron reports. Maddy was reportedly waiting for a friend sunday and was passing the time riding her scooter around the complex. The last surveillance video of maddy, taken at 5: 07pm, shows her riding the scooter past a row of metal mailboxes, per the san jose mercury news. Laura jordan, maddy's mom, tells the paper she searched far and wide for her daughter, thinking \" maybe she got bored waiting for her play date, maybe she found another friend. But we had no luck. \" a detective helping search last night happened to lift the lid of a dumpster and made the terrible discovery, kron notes. Neighbors tell the mercury news that the teen boy's mother \" screamed in agony \" when he was arrested. ( in florida, two teens are still missing after their fishing boat overturned ).",

Per the detroit news, ntsb officials were dispatched to an area outside st. Ignace on michigan's upper peninsula last week after employees in a national forest found a crashed piper cherokee 235. The plane is believed to be the one that mark and janet davies were in when they took off from drummond island in lake huron in 1997 and were never seen or heard from again. The husband and wife were headed to the town of howell 300 miles south when radar showed mark, the pilot, made a sudden turn north then disappeared in foggy weather. A search party fanned out in search of the plane but no sign of it was seen until wednesday, when a surveyor came upon the crash site. The plane was officially ruled lost and its occupants presumed dead. Janet's brother, michael smith, said he didn't think that this revelation would ever come. \" pretty much everyone had given up hope, \" he told wpbn. Now, he says, the family can have closure. Smith will reportedly be giving authorities a sample of his dna in order to verify the identity of his sister's remains.

            "Large depositors at cyprus ' largest bank may be forced to accept losses of up to 60 percent, far more than initially feared under the european rescue package to save the country from bankruptcy, officials said saturday. Deposits of more than 100,000 euros ( $ 128,000 ) at the bank of cyprus would lose 37.5 percent in money that would be converted into bank shares, according to a finance ministry decree obtained by the associated press. In a second raid on these accounts, depositors also could lose up to 22.5 percent more, depending on what experts determine is needed to prop up the bank's reserves. Banking and finance ministry officials confirmed these details in interviews with the ap. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to publicly discuss the issue. The deposits that converted to bank shares would theoretically allow depositors to eventually recover their losses. But the shares now hold little value and it's uncertain when _ if ever _ the shares will regain a value equal to the depositors ' losses. Europe has demanded that large depositors in the country's two largest banks _ bank of cyprus and laiki bank _ accept across-the-board losses in order to pay for the 16 billion euro ( $ 20.5 billion ) bailout. But officials had previously spoken of a loss to big depositors of 30 to 40 percent. Analysts said saturday that imposing bigger losses on major depositors could further squeeze already crippled businesses as cyprus tries to rebuild its banking sector in exchange for the international rescue package. \" most of the damage will be done to businesses which had their money in the bank \" to pay suppliers and employees, said university of cyprus economics professor sofronis clerides. \" there's quite a difference between a 30 percent loss and a 60 percent loss. \" with businesses shrinking, the country could be dragged down into an even deeper recession, he said. There's also concern that large depositors _ including many wealthy russians _ would take their money and run once capital restrictions that cypriot authorities have imposed on bank transactions to prevent such a possibility are lifted in about a month. Cyprus agreed on monday to make bank depositors with accounts over 100,000 euros to contribute to a financial rescue in order to secure 10 billion euros ( $ 12.9 billion ) in loans from the eurozone and the international monetary fund.

Critics seem to agree that the film is hilarious — though most have a quibble or two. Here's what they're saying: \" there is stuff in this is the end that had me laughing so hard, i sensed new body parts joining in to help out — my pancreas was heaving, my bile ducts ripped, \" writes kyle smith at the new york post. But \" the movie falls short of being a classic \" thanks to its flabby pacing and lackluster structure. \" it's destined to be watched by viewers with one thumb on the fast-forward button. \" the bickering between the stars \" is so fast and obscene that you feel like you're eavesdropping on the sorts of things comedians say to each other when they're off camera, \" writes owen gleiberman at ew. Thankfully, \" the movie doesn't play the end of days for laughs. It's an honest-to-god metaphysical disaster movie, \" which makes the comedy \" all the more explosive. \" \" it's the best and funniest and most absurd and outrageous and self-referential of all high-concept, stars-playing-themselves, jewish rapture movies ever made, \" writes andrew o ' hehir at salon, but it's also obnoxiously self-satisfied. Rogen and goldberg need to get over the idea that \" nothing could possibly supersede the awesomeness of hanging out with them and their young, rich, famous friends. \" it's basically \" a foul-mouthed, good-natured ' funny-or-die'sketch stretched to feature length, \" observes ao scott at the new york times. And while it's \" genuinely, even sublimely hilarious, \" the title could easily refer to \" the creative exhaustion of its makers and the popular, profitable strain of humor they represent. \" the house the gang is trapped in \" represents the limitations of an insular, exclusive, and increasingly self-cannibalizing comic imagination. \"",

        "summary": "Lamar odom is fighting for his life in the hospital, and while it's still unclear how he came to be unconscious in a nevada brothel, some dubious sex pills could be to blame. The former nba and reality tv star had taken \" upwards of 10 \" doses of a 72-hour \" herbal viagra \" pill in his three days at the brothel, love ranch owner dennis hof tells the new york daily news. Odom bought the reload pills at the brothel, hof tells the washington post. He describes it as an \" over-the counter speedy kind of product, \" but the post reports that the fda issued a warning about reload in 2013, telling consumers it contained the same active ingredient as regular viagra and could dangerously lower blood pressure. \" consumers should stop using this product immediately and throw it away, \" the fda said. Ranch spokesman richard hunter says odom took cocaine before he arrived there on saturday. He says he doesn't know if he took more after arriving, though the two women he spent time with had been ordered to \" stop the party \" if illegal drugs were seen, the ap reports. A police spokeswoman declined to say whether drugs had been found in odom's room, reports the los angeles times. \" we're going to be looking at the entire situation, \" she said when asked whether criminal charges will be filed in the case. Odom is still on life support in a las vegas hospital, and tmz reports that khloe kardashian is making medical decisions for him as his wife.

The guardian reports that plans are \" on hold \" after trump relayed as much on a phone call made in recent weeks to prime minister theresa may, who had extended the invitation on behalf of queen elizabeth just a week into trump's presidency. A downing street adviser claims to have been present during the call, saying trump would withhold visiting until the public supports him coming. The claim comes days after london mayor sadiq khan, who has been feuding with trump, said the president should cancel his trip. No firm date was ever announced, though it was expected sometime in the fall. The new york times also reports that trump is reconsidering the visit, quoting administration officials who say he has told aides and may herself that he is hesitant. But spokespeople for both trump and may reject the allegation. The white house released a statement saying that trump has \"tremendous respect \" for may and denies the trip was mentioned in their recent phone calls, and a washington post reporter tweeted that press secretary sean spicer called the guardian report \"false. \" may's office denies that anything has changed and says it won't \" comment on speculation \" about private phone calls, per reuters. \" the queen extended an invitation to president trump to visit the uk and there is no change to those plans. \"",

A rough outline, with details from the las vegas sun, the las vegas review-journal, nbc news, and the associated press: first threat: tammy meyers, 44, took her 15-year-old daughter, kristal, out for a night driving lesson. As they were heading home, with tammy driving, kristal says she leaned over and honked at a silver car that pulled up beside them. She says the driver spun in front of them, forcing them to stop, and the driver got out and told tammy, \" i ' m gonna come back for you and your daughter. \" kristal says the man appeared to be 6 feet tall; nowsch is 5-3. Two shootings: tammy sped home and summoned her 22-year-old son, brandon. He says he urged his mom to call police and stay home, but went along when she said she would go looking for the car alone. They found the silver car and began following, and brandon says someone in the passenger seat began firing at them. They sped home, and brandon says the silver car followed them to their cul-de-sac, where a person in the passenger seat fired at them again. He says he fired back, the car left, and he discovered that his mother had been shot in the head. Nowsch to friends: in the version nowsch told friends, he said he was in a park near the school that night when he thought someone was following him in a green car. ( the color of the meyers'vehicle. ) he called a friend with the silver audi to come pick him up. He said he started shooting the first time when he thought he saw someone in the green car waving a gun from the window. He also said that he was sure he hit someone when he fired again on the cul-de-sac. The driver of the silver car has not been identified. The police report seems to suggest that nowsch mistook the meyers'driving lesson as a threat, and things spiraled out of control after that.

        "summary": "A maryland couple whose youtube prank videos garnered them accusations of child abuse were sentenced to five years probation on child neglect charges monday, buzzfeed reports. Michael and heather martin entered a plea to avoid jail time, admitting the state had enough to convict them without actually admitting guilt. The martins ' youtube channel, daddyofive, featured hundreds of videos of them \" pranking \" their five children, according to the frederick news-post. Prosecutors singled out one video showing heather screaming obscenities at a crying 10-year-old cody — their youngest child — after falsely accusing him of pouring ink on the carpet and another video where cody is falsely told he is no longer going to live with them. Psychological evaluations found cody and 11-year-old emma suffered \" mental injury \" from the videos. The martins lost custody of cody and emma in may. Under the terms of their probation, they aren't allowed to have any contact with the two children or post any videos featuring them. \" it was clear from those evaluations that these kids were emotionally traumatized, so we felt child neglect charges were appropriate, \" state's attorney j. Charles smith tells fox 5. Assistant state's attorney lindy angel says the martins showed \" an extreme lapse in judgement \" but didn't mean to harm their children. Heather and michael are still posting prank videos that don't feature their children to their mommyofive channel. Their lawyer says they may return to posting videos featuring their other three children \" just not in the same fashion as before. \" ( it's not the only youtube video to end horribly. )",

Experts looked at illnesses and hospitalizations from various kinds of foods between 1998 and 2008. Healthy stuff, including fruits and vegetables, accounted for some 46 % of illnesses. Leafy vegetables were responsible for the most illnesses, while dairy was responsible for the most hospitalizations. Beef ranked sixth in numbers of illnesses caused, behind fruits and nuts, and various vegetables; it ranked seventh in hospitalizations. Pork ranked even lower in both cases. But don't think the cdc is giving you an excuse to opt for a burger over broccoli: \" other factors, such as the health benefits of consuming a diet high in fruits and vegetables, must also be considered, \" the researchers say.

The clashes saw some rebels from the coastal town of zlitin in western libya join fighters in neighboring misrata, signaling an expansion in opposition to col. Gadhafi's regime in a part of the country still largely under his control. Col.

In accordance with the law, the hunter brought the dead mountain lion to a state inspector, who verified the kill was legal and pulled a tooth to determine the animal's age. \" in the process of harvesting the animal we had an officer check it, and we determined something really interesting was going on, \" a fish and game spokeswoman tells east idaho news.

It left radioactive water, diesel fuel, human waste, and possibly pcbs buried with camp century — it believed forever. \" the phrase they used was that the waste would be preserved for eternity by perpetually accumulating snow, \" physical geographer william colgan tells npr. Instead, colgan's research — published thursday in geophysical research letters — says those pollutants could start escaping by the end of the century thanks to global warming. He concludes the ice sheet could start losing more ice than it gains by 2090. When that happens, it \" would guarantee the eventual remobilization of physical, chemical, biological, and radiological wastes. \" even though it would likely take another 100 years or so for camp century to be completely exposed, problems could start much earlier. If cracks form in the ice, water could run down to the buried pollutants — including radioactive cooling water from the base's old nuclear reactor — and then carry them into the ocean. It's unclear who owns the waste, as the base was built under a danish-us treaty, and who will need to deal with the fallout in the future. Interesting aside: camp century was built in 1959 as a research base. But unbeknownst to the public, the army was using it for project iceworm — massive railway tunnels under the ice sheet that would be used to send underground nuclear missiles at the soviet union.

Mccartney isn't actually a member of the band, but, perry tells rolling stone, the former beatle contributed one track to the upcoming album: a new version of \" come and get it, \" which he wrote and produced for badfinger ( then called the iveys ) and has rarely performed since 1969. Perry explains, \" the record is dedicated to all the friends we've lost to drugs and alcohol over the years and getting people to come in and cover the songs their friends wrote. \" rolling stone explains how badfinger fits in: members pete ham and tom evans took their own lives. Perry adds that cooper shared lead vocals with mccartney on the track. Few other details ( like when to expect the album ) have been released, but rolling stone notes that the hollywood vampires are scheduled to play at rock in rio in september, and perry says the full tour is being planned for that same month.

        "summary": "You know that creepy feeling like something or someone might be lurking under your bed at night? warning: this story will not mitigate that. Cops accuse jason hubbard, a new jersey man who apparently didn't have a place to live, of breaking into the spotswood home of his ex-girlfriend's parents, heading into an upstairs bedroom, and camping out under a bed in a spare bedroom — for anywhere from three to five days, wabc and other local media report. The bizarre break-in took place back in may, when hubbard reportedly waited for one of the home's residents to take out the garbage, then slipped in through the open door and sneaked into the bedroom where his ex used to sleep. He managed to avoid detection for up to five days, wabc notes, until resident margaret adamcewicz says her husband heard a noise, went upstairs to check it out, and found hubbard in his hiding spot. She says her 28-year-old son kept hubbard at bay while her husband called police. \" he used to date my daughter five years ago, \" she says, adding that she was more angry than scared. \" it didn't end well. He didn't say why he came back. He just picked our house to hide out in. \" in addition to criminal trespass and burglary, hubbard was also charged with theft of services: he's accused of charging four cellphones in an outlet under the bed during his stay, nbc news reports. The station notes that the crime is just being reported now because spotswood police only release records every six months. ( a florida woman looking for her cats under her bed found a person instead. )",

The 20-year-old german, identified in a local newspaper only as tobias, was part of a group of six who called themselves the \"bavarian dumbasses. \" they modeled their stunts on those performed by the jackass crew and posted video of them on youtube. In the lethal stunt, tobias was taped to a playground merry-go-round while his friends tied a rope from one end to a car, then stepped on the gas to make the carousel spin as fast as possible. The tape ripped, and tobias hurtled from the merry-go-round and plunged head-first into the ground, reports abc news. \"i heard this terrible scream and shouts for help, \" said a woman who lives nearby. \"when i arrived my husband was already there and he was trying to revive the victim but it was useless.

            "Getty images a german amateur stunt performer died instantly from head injuries after being thrown from a spinning playground carousel in a \" jackass \" -style stunt gone awry in the bavarian town of oberviehbach. The 20-year-old man, known only as tobias, was part of the group known as the \" bavarian dumbasses, \" a gang of six young german men who gained notoriety for filming their shenanigans and posting them to the web via youtube and facebook. Tobias was taped to the playground carousel and roped to a bmw by his three cohorts on sunday, according to the munchner merkur newspaper. With the rope hitched to the car, the three other young men, who the paper said were 18-20 years old, then put the car in full throttle in attempt to spin tobias as fast as possible. As the car took off, tobias was propelled by centrifugal force at an incredibly high speed - so fast that the tape tore off and he was sent hurtling six yards from the merry-go-round and head first into the ground. A woman who lived near the playground said that she then heard blood-curdling screams. \" i heard this terrible scream and shouts for help, \" the woman, identified by munchner merkur as rita h., said. \" when i arrived my husband was already there and he was trying to revive the victim but it was useless. He was covered in blood and think his neck was broken. \" a father on the scene quickly came to pull his two young children away from the horrific scene, reported munchner merkur, adding that when police arrived they found the driver of the vehicle crying in his car. Police are now looking at manslaughter charges against the friends, according to munchner merkur.
