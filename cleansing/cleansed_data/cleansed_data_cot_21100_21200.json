Yes, the world of professional cycling has uncovered its first case of \" motorized doping \" in a major competition, reports the sydney morning herald. It came in the wake of the women's cyclocross world championships in belgium over the weekend, when officials using \" some kind of radio-frequency-detecting tablet \" discovered the motor in the bike of 19-year-old belgian rider femke van den driessche, reports gizmodo. Rumors of this kind of cheating have been floating around for years, but this is the first time an actual motor has been found. \" it's absolutely clear that there was technological fraud, \" says union cycliste internationale chief brian cookson. \" there was a concealed motor. \" the accused rider says it's all a big mistake, blaming a mechanic for handing her an \" identical \" bike that belonged to a friend. \" this friend went around the course saturday before dropping off the bike in the truck, \" says van den driessche. \" a mechanic, thinking it was my bike, cleaned it and prepared it for my race. \" however, she faces at least a six-month ban from the sport and acknowledges that her cycling career might be done, reports cycling news. Weirdly, van den driessche didn't actually finish saturday's race — she had to withdraw over unspecified \" mechanical issues. \"",

Niec came to the us with his parents ( both doctors, now deceased ) and sister ( an attorney who eventually attained citizenship ) sometime between the ages of 3 and 6, per various sources, and since has been a green card resident, which permits an individual to live and work legally in the us. Per the washington post, his detention stems back to his two youthful convictions: one for \" malicious destruction of property under $ 100 \" and the other for \" receiving and concealing stolen property over $ 100. \" his sister says he pleaded guilty to the second offense as part of a state program that cleared his record, but per wood, ice doesn't honor that state deal. Mlive found other infractions: minor traffic violations, a 2008 \" operating while impaired by liquor \" offense ( his conviction was scrubbed after he completed probation ), and a 2013 domestic violence charge ( he was found not guilty at trial ). His co-workers, however, are \" outraged, \" per wood. \" he's exactly the kind of person our immigration policies should be encouraging to prosper here, \" a colleague says.

And she says she didn't realize how important her own role was. \" i didn't get how much you hung on to every word i said to you, \" she says. \" i used to tell you that cancer will be just a phase in your life.

Steve palumbi calls it \" the most destructive thing we have ever done to the ocean. \" yet the stanford marine sciences professor and fellow researchers have found a thriving marine ecosystem in the waters in and around the crater left by the bikini atoll nuclear tests. Palumbi says their study — the first looking in-depth at the effects of radiation on marine life — shows marine life is \" remarkably resilient. \" while there are some signs of mutation in nurse sharks in the area, according to usa today, hundreds of schools of fish are apparently healthy, as are the giant coconut crabs munching on radioactive coconuts. Perhaps most impressive is the coral — some of it as big as cars — which appears to have started growing as soon as a decade after the bombings. The coral shows no signs of being cancerous, and researchers hope learning why that is could potentially help humans fight cancer in the future, the stanford daily reports. \" the terrible history of bikini atoll is an ironic setting for research that might help people live longer, \" phys.org quotes palumbi as saying. The testing on bikini atoll rendered it a nuclear wasteland, one that is still unsafe for human habitation, but the bombs may have ultimately helped the coral, fish, and other marine life currently living there. \" in a strange way they are protected by the history of this place...

        "summary": "\" we're winning, winning, winning the country, \" donald trump declared after a thumping win in nevada's gop caucuses tuesday night — and many observers seem inclined to agree. He not only won by what appears to be his biggest margin yet, he swept almost every category of voters, including latinos, cnn notes. With what seems to be unstoppable momentum heading toward super tuesday, the hill is among those calling trump the \" presumptive nominee. \" more: in his victory speech at a las vegas casino, trump predicted that he would wrap up the nomination quickly, taking the home states of rivals — including john kasich — on the way, the new york times reports. \" it's going to be an amazing two months, \" he said. \" we might not even need the two months, to be honest. \" in a speech to supporters, cruz, tied for second with marco rubio in early results, argued that he is now clearly the only alternative to trump. \" the undeniable reality the first four states has shown is the only campaign that has beat donald trump, and the only campaign that can beat donald trump, is this one, \" he said. Poll numbers ahead of super tuesday don't reveal any clear path to the nomination for any of trump's rivals, the guardian reports. Apart from arkansas and texas, polls in most of the 11 states, including conservative southern ones, give trump a big lead. Ben carson, meanwhile, says he's not going anywhere despite a distant fourth-place finish, the hill reports. He told supporters that he has had \" many situations where people said this is impossible, it can't be done \" — and that's when he starts to find things exciting.",

Trump, who said he is \" absolutely fine \" with meeting vladimir putin soon, took a more combative tone on china. He said everything about the us relationship with beijing is under consideration, including the \" one china \" policy on taiwan. He complained about china's currency policies, and about beijing's reaction to his phone conversation with taiwan's president. \" we sold them $ 2 billion of military equipment last year. We can sell them $ 2 billion of the latest and greatest military equipment but we're not allowed to accept a phone call, \" he said. He did, however, show the journal the christmas card he received from china's president xi jinping. \" i have a beautiful card from the chairman, \" he said.

Gardner, \" the president told reporters when asked about the bill. \" i know exactly what he's doing; we're looking at it. \" if the bill becomes law, it would \" reshape the pot industry, \" in the words of the los angeles times, and put an end to a crackdown initiated by sessions earlier this year. Specifically, the legislation would change the federal controlled substances act to give states free rein to decide how marijuana should be regulated within their own borders, explains the ap. About two dozen states have legalized marijuana in some form, but the issue remains complicated because of a federal classification of the drug that puts it on par with lsd and heroin. Trump's comments are just the latest example of the president's soured relations with sessions. The new york times notes that trump's decision to commute the sentence of non-violent drug offender alice johnson earlier this week runs counter to sessions'directive in such cases. What's more, trump told his aides to look for similar cases in which prisoners were treated \" unfairly. \" ( trump continues to publicly criticize his ag.",

By mark shwartz stanford postdoc yingpen wu and colleagues have developed the first rechargeable aluminum-ion battery that's inexpensive, long-lasting and safe. ( mark shwartz / precourt institute for energy ) stanford university scientists have invented the first high-performance aluminum battery that's fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive. Researchers say the new technology offers a safe alternative to many commercial batteries in wide use today. \" we have developed a rechargeable aluminum battery that may replace existing storage devices, such as alkaline batteries, which are bad for the environment, and lithium-ion batteries, which occasionally burst into flames, \" said hongjie dai, a professor of chemistry at stanford. \" our new battery won't catch fire,",
            "Smartphones could be charged in less than one minute after scientists at stanford university invented an aluminium battery so powerful it could revolutionise the industry. The new rechargeable battery can go from flat to full in a fraction of the time it currently takes to pull in enough electricity to fully charge a phone, laptop or tablet. While an iphone 6 takes around two hours to fully charge its in-built battery, if it was fitted with the aluminium power source it would be completely topped up in around 60 seconds. And it will keep going for more than seven times as long as a lithium-ion battery. A traditional battery can be recharged around 1,000 times, while the new one can withstand 7,500 cycles. Although the new battery currently only produces half the voltage of a typical lithium battery, the scientists are confident that they will improve output within the next few years. \"otherwise, our battery"

Called flakka, it's already been reported in florida, ohio, texas, and is likely circulating in other states, forbes reports. Florida cases are particularly disturbing, cbs news notes, like the guy who tried bashing down the door of a police station, or the armed man who stood naked on a rooftop with a gun shouting, \" i feel delusional, and i ' m hallucinating! \" just what is flakka? it's a rock-form, crystalline drug made from a synthetic variant of cathinone, a chemical found in the khat plant in somalia and the middle east, where people munch on plant leaves to get a buzz. In synthetic forms, cathinones like flakka ( and bath salts ) can be similar to the most extreme effects of cocaine and crystal meth. What's more, people who take flakka while high on other drugs ( called \" snacking \" ) are known to experience psychosis, extreme aggression, and pounding heart rates. Users can also run high body temperatures, strip naked, \" and have an adrenaline-like strength \" that requires \" four or five officers \" to subdue, says an epidemiologist. \" if [ users ] don't receive immediate medical attention they can die. \" and florida crime labs are seeing a rapid rise in cases, from zero in 2010 to 670 in 2014, the sun-sentinel reports. Largely made in labs in pakistan, india, and china, flakka is often mixed into a mystery cocktail of drugs before ending up on us streets — so buyers don't really know what they're getting. One user called it \" $ 5 insanity, \" says a sheriff's treatment counselor. \" this is as bad as it gets. \" ( click for the latest on powdered alcohol. )",

Defense secretary leon panetta declared the iraq war over in a quiet ceremony in baghdad, saying the conflict was worth the cost because it set iraq on a path to democracy.

Eight years, eight months, and 25 days after it started. American troops will be home for the holidays, and won't have to wait for the dec. 31 deadline set by a us-iraq agreement, reports the washington post.

You will leave with lasting pride, secure in knowing that your sacrifice has helped the iraqi people begin a new chapter in history, free from tyranny and full of hope for prosperity and peace. \" iraqi response is mixed. Thousands in the town of fallujah were celebrating by burning american and israeli flags. But one resident was worried about the likelihood of new sectarian violence. \"what's the point of lighting a candle at the beginning of a tunnel when you know you will be walking in darkness? \" he asked. \"i am happy they are going, but i know my happiness won't last for long. \" more than 100,000 iraqi and 4,487 american lives were lost in the war.",

In an interview with fortune, the ceo of apple, which could soon become the world's first company worth $ 1 trillion, says he has already begun donating quietly. Why? \" you want to be the pebble in the pond that creates the ripples for change, \" says cook, who claims $ 120 million in apple stock, plus $ 665 million in restricted stock. No word on which specific charities he would support, but cook \" plans to take time to develop a systematic approach to philanthropy rather than simply writing checks, \" fortune notes. He has previously expressed his support for human rights and equality and described a need to address climate change and hiv/aids. With cook at the helm, apple itself has been no stranger to philanthropy. In an early 2012 meeting, he reportedly touted the company's $ 50 million donation to aids/tuberculosis/malaria charity product red, as well as a donation in the same amount to stanford hospitals, the verge reported at the time. In the interview with fortune, cook, a fairly private guy, also touches on his decision to come out as gay last year, noting most people at apple were aware of his sexuality and found the announcement to be a \" yawner. \" but seeing kids bullied at school and employees fired over their sexual orientation tipped the scales. \" to be honest, if i would not have come to the conclusion that it would likely help other people, i would have never done it, \" he says. \" there's no joy in me putting my life in view. \"",

        "summary": "Ecologists from down under are keeping a wary eye on ocean waters as an \" aggressive \" fish migrates south from papua new guinea toward the aussie mainland. What makes anabas testudineus, or the climbing perch, so frightening that one scientist tells the guardian it would be a \" major disaster \" for native fish, turtles, and birds? well, predators who swallow the perch are in trouble: the fish simply swells up inside them until their throats are blocked and they choke or starve. And the climbing perch is no ordinary fish: it uses its sharp spines to crawl across dry land ( check out the video shown here ) and can breathe air — it has lungs in addition to gills, and ecology asia explains that it gulps down air and holds it in a \" labyrinth organ. \" the freshwater fish can live for almost a week out of the water and apparently survive in salt water, as well as hide out in the mud of creek beds for six-month stretches. The fish, a native resident of southeast asia, first moved southward to indonesia and papua new guinea and now has been seen on australia's two most northern outposts, the guardian notes. Nathan waltham, a researcher at james cook university, doesn't think the perch can actually swim the entire way to the mainland, but he fears they ' ll find their way via the bottom of fishing boats \" or as discarded live-bait fish. \" fellow scientists in papua new guinea have already found some of the perch's victims ( barramundi, catfish, and birds that tried to devour them ), a worrisome discovery for australia's ecological watchdogs. \" when they populate an area they're not commonly found in, they can disrupt the balance of that habitat, \" waltham says, per the guardian.

        "summary": "Jocelyn wildenstein — better known as \" catwoman, \" the \" lion woman of new york, \" and the \" bride of wildenstein \" for her surgically created cat-like countenance — has filed for bankruptcy. At one time wildenstein spent at least $ 1 million a month on a lifestyle that included gulfstream jets, safaris, and pet tigers, extensively chronicled in a vanity fair profile. Although the 77-year-old manhattan socialite has nothing in her bank account, she has plenty of assets, notes fox news. They include three connected apartments on the 51st floor of trump world tower worth $ 11.75 million ( but she owes $ 4.6 million on the complex, which is in foreclosure and owes $ 25,000 in property taxes ); a 2006 bentley worth $ 35,000 ( but she owes $ 38,000 on it ); and $ 100,000 in belongings ( but they're in a storage facility and she owes $ 700,000 to the storage company ). Wildenstein also owes $ 273,000 to various law firms, $ 175,000 to her contractor, and $ 165,000 to the owner of a beverly hills rental property. The debt is somewhat remarkable because in 1999 wildenstein received an estimated $ 2.5 billion in her divorce from art dealer alec wildenstein, now deceased. But all is not lost, as she is reporting $ 16.4 million in assets and $ 6.4 million in debt. She also gets $ 900 a month in social security. And she believes she can recover financially if she gets the $ 4.5 million due from her divorce. But for now, she says, \" i am not employed and my only income is social security … i often turn to friends and family in order to pay my ongoing expenses. \"",

The reported confession from joseph ray daniels, 28, ends a days-long frantic effort to find joe, who was non-verbal and prone to wandering off the family property outside nashville, per usa today. The search for joe started wednesday after a morning 911 call that soon led to multiple police agencies and hundreds of volunteers combing the area. Joseph daniels even told wkrn at the time that he feared his son was \" lonely, tired, scared and confused. \" many concerned members of the community hoped that, like the previous times he'd disappeared, joe would be found safe. His own father's confession changed all that saturday, police say. According to the tennessee bureau of investigation, daniels confessed to police that he'd intentionally killed his son sometime during the night of april 3-4 in their home and then hid the body. The shocking revelation came on the heels of what were then seen as hopeful developments, including a footprint that police believed could have been joe's as well as what investigators called credible information the boy had been spotted. The tbi arrested daniels and charged him with one count of criminal homicide. As police continue to search for joe's remains, his 8- and 3-year-old siblings have reportedly been removed from the home and placed in the care of relatives.",

            "Some new jersey politicians ( well, ok, one assemblyman at least ) are furious after learning that the first season of mtv's jersey shore, a paean to all things terrible about america's fourth-worst state, will cost the state's taxpayers $ 420,000 in tax credits. The horror! an assemblyman named declan o'scanlon, a name he clearly made up when either bumblingly going undercover to infiltrate the ira or to work more convincingly at a bennigan's, is outraged that his state's hardworking taxpayers are forced to fork over $ 420,000 so these mooks, some of whom are not even from new jersey!, can tan and drink and recite wordsworth to each other or whatever they do on that show. Of course the mayor of seaside heights, who is just a mozzarella stick wearing a fake mustache and a bowler hat, says that when the show brings in far more than $ 420,000 in tourism dollars, but screw that! the whole idea that you have to spend money to make money is ridiculous and has never been proven true. That's why governor chris christie got rid of the film tax credit program last year. Can't have local crews, caterers, and other such layabouts employed at the expense of 10¢ a taxpayer. No sir. And yet",

Police say a storm had killed power to the home in sharon, pa., on monday night, so the resident family of five, including three children under 5, lit a candle for light. Shortly after 11pm, a 5-year-old daughter reportedly knocked it over, then tried to hide the flames with clothes, fearing she'd be in trouble, report cbs pittsburgh and wtae. The flames reached a couch, and as the fire erupted, father terry thomas carried son layden outside, \" put him on the porch, and went back in \" for his wife and daughters, all of whom survived, police say. Layden, however, must have followed his dad inside and hid under a bed, where firefighters later found his body, authorities say. They believe he died of smoke inhalation. Mom brittany smith says she remembers layden standing in front of the home after she escaped. \" i was outside with my newborn baby and my oldest daughter … and layden was right by my feet, and i ' m trying to call the police while i take care of them, and i just glanced away for a second and he ran back in the house, \" she says, calling the event a freak accident. \" i did my best, i got him to safety, \" says thomas, who left the home as the ceiling began to collapse, per the pittsburgh tribune-review. \" i chalk it up as this is what god wanted, \" he adds. \" there's nothing we could do. \" layden's great-grandfather describes the boy as \" just a sweet little baby, that's all. He was wonderful. He was my buddy. \" a relative says the family had no insurance and \" walked away with no shoes on their feet. \" they're accepting donations to the layden thomas memorial fund.

        "summary": "If repasts at restaurants in china have seemed especially delectable ( and irresistible ) as of late, it may be because workers were sprinkling addictive opiates into the mix. That's what that country's equivalent of the fda alleges, and now five restaurants are being prosecuted, while 30 others are getting a closer look, the independent reports. The illicit seasoning in question: powder from opium poppies, which can contain small amounts of codeine and morphine and, some say, get consumers hooked on their meals, per the ap. The powder — which can be bought in western china for about $ 60 a kilo — is often mixed with chili powder and oil, which makes it harder to detect, and stirred into soups and seafood dishes. Although the ap says it's \" unclear \" whether the opium flavoring can actually cause addiction, the substance has been banned since 2013, per cnn, and runs counter to china's food safety law, reports china daily. \" there are so many restaurants in china and it is very difficult to effectively inspect every one of them to ensure they all follow the law, \" a food safety professor at china agricultural university tells china daily. Meanwhile, citizens are unloading their anger online. \" how much poison have we eaten? \" one commented on a national consumer site, per the telegraph, while another one posted: \" unscrupulous merchants harming people with poison. I finally know the reason for the long queues outside this restaurant. \" ( this isn't the first time this has happened in china. )",

Continued worries about us-china tensions — exacerbated by news of the arrest of a chinese tech exec in canada at the us'request — were largely blamed for the market turmoil, per marketwatch.

What pundits are saying: what if we'd been told the costs from the start? \" it will take eight years, cost the lives of 4,488 us troops, \" and \" the civil war we unleash will kill more than 100,000 iraqis.

In the los angeles times, doyle mcmanus writes that the us suffered from \" hubris \" and intelligence that was both flawed and manipulated. \" there's nothing like a decade of grinding war to teach that invasions aren't easy and counterinsurgency isn't short, \" he says. Our arrogance may have lessened, but intelligence is always fallible — and it remains bound together with politics.

            "The number of people who have been forcibly displaced by war and other crises worldwide has risen to its highest level for almost two decades, hitting 45.2 million, according to the un's refugee agency. Annual figures released by the united nations high commission for refugees ( unhcr ) on wednesday showed that 1.1 million fled across international borders in 2012, while a further 6.5 million were displaced within their own homelands. \" this means one in each 4.1 seconds. So each time you blink, another person is forced to flee, \" antonio guterres, the un high commissioner for refugees, told reporters. The total figure of 45.2 million included 28.8 million internally displaced people, 15.4 million border-crossing refugees, and 937,000 asylum seekers. \" war is the main reason for this very high number of refugees and people internally displaced. Fifty-five percent of them correspond to the well-known situations of afghanistan, somalia, iraq, sudan, and syria, \" guterres said. Overall, the afghan conflict continued to produce the most refugees, a position that it has held for 32 years. Worldwide, one refugee in four is afghan. Guterres also cited conflicts in mali, the democratic republic of congo and central african republic as producing large numbers of displaced people and refugees. Due to the raft of crises, he said, the total number of refugees and internally displaced had risen to a level unseen since 1994, a year marked by the rwandan genocide and bloodshed in former yugoslavia. ' multiplication of conflicts ' while last year saw 2.1 million internally-displaced people and 526,000 refugees return home, as well as the resettlement of 88,6000 in rich nations, fresh crises drove the global total higher. \" new refugees, new internally displaced, unfortunately represent much more than those able to find an answer to their plight, \" said guterres, lamenting the international community's limited capacity to prevent conflicts and to find timely solutions to existing ones. \" we witness a multiplication of new conflicts, and it seems that old conflicts never die, \" he said. Guterres pointed out that the number of people who had fled the spiralling violence in syria had soared from 650,000 at the end of 2012 to around 1.6 million now, surpassing last year's total from all conflicts. The unhcr has warned that syrian refugee numbers could hit 3.5 million by the end of this year, while there are also fears that the number currently displaced within the country, 4.25 million, will also climb. Syrian refugees have flooded into neighbouring lebanon, jordan, turkey and iraq,"

Annual figures released by the united nations high commission for refugees ( unhcr ) on wednesday showed that 1.1 million fled across international borders in 2012, while a further 6.5 million were displaced within their own homelands. \" this means one in each 4.1 seconds. So each time you blink, another person is forced to flee, \" antonio guterres, the un high commissioner for refugees, told reporters. The total figure of 45.2 million included 28.8 million internally displaced people, 15.4 million border-crossing refugees, and 937,000 asylum seekers. \" war is the main reason for this very high number of refugees and people internally displaced. Fifty-five percent of them correspond to the well-known situations of afghanistan, somalia, iraq, sudan, and syria, \" guterres said. Overall, the afghan conflict continued to produce the most refugees, a position that it has held for 32 years. Worldwide, one refugee in four is afghan. Guterres also cited conflicts in mali, the democratic republic of congo and central african republic as producing large numbers of displaced people and refugees. Due to the raft of crises, he said, the total number of refugees and internally displaced had risen to a level unseen since 1994, a year marked by the rwandan genocide and bloodshed in former yugoslavia. ' multiplication of conflicts ' while last year saw 2.1 million internally-displaced people and 526,000 refugees return home, as well as the resettlement of 88,6000 in rich nations, fresh crises drove the global total higher. \" new refugees, new internally displaced, unfortunately represent much more than those able to find an answer to their plight, \" said guterres, lamenting the international community's limited capacity to prevent conflicts and to find timely solutions to existing ones. \" we witness a multiplication of new conflicts, and it seems that old conflicts never die, \" he said. Guterres pointed out that the number of people who had fled the spiralling violence in syria had soared from 650,000 at the end of 2012 to around 1.6 million now, surpassing last year's total from all conflicts. The unhcr has warned that syrian refugee numbers could hit 3.5 million by the end of this year, while there are also fears that the number currently displaced within the country, 4.25 million, will also climb. Syrian refugees have flooded into neighbouring lebanon, jordan, turkey and iraq,"

One cop even ended up at the hospital. Two men in the mission district were treated for non-life-threatening gunshot wounds and another sustained serious injuries after being stabbed multiple times, the san francisco chronicle reports. Brawls weren't an odd sight, either, as the smell of booze and marijuana wafted through the streets. Sirens blared throughout market street and the civic center plaza, where game 7 had been broadcast live. There, a bus's windows were smashed in, though most bus service was suspended anyway. Nearby, someone's old couch ended up in flames in the street as partiers danced around it. \" this isn't how we celebrate, y ' all, \" one woman was heard shouting. \" we're better than this! \" the response from one reveler: \" calm down, lady. It's just a couch. \" elsewhere in the city, however, celebrations were calmer, kcra reports. \" it's clean fun, \" said one woman, who described the scene as \" the anti-apocalypse where people are nice to each other and high-fiving. \"",

        "summary": "A study that shows toy-related injuries have jumped 40 % over the past two decades might have parents reconsidering their kids ' holiday wish lists. The report, published in clinical pediatrics today, shows that the injury rate for toy-related accidents, which affects boys and younger children the most, increased from 18.9 per every 10,000 kids in 1990 to 26.9 in 2011, usa today reports. These \" common injuries, \" according to dr. Gary smith, the study's lead author, sent more than 3.2 million kids to the er over the study's 20-year period. And the toy that seems to be behind the lion's share of the injuries? the foot-powered scooter and similar ride-on toys, a fact that's backed up by the consumer product safety commission's 2013 annual report. The study, said to be the first to \" comprehensively investigate \" these types of injuries, found that scooter accidents usually involved kids between the ages of 5 and 17 and that the most common scooter injury was lacerations, today.com reports. Razor, which makes a popular scooter brand, didn't respond to usa today's request for comment, but a spokeswoman for the toy association of america says in an email to nbc news that \" toy-related \" injuries simply refers to injuries that happen while a child is playing with a toy, not that the toy directly caused the injury. While the american academy of pediatrics offers tips on avoiding scooter-related accidents — including keeping kids away from moving traffic and supervising those younger than 8 — its no. 1 tip echoes smith's advice: \" wear a helmet, wear a helmet, wear a helmet. \" ( a risk to infants: the way we put them to bed. )",

Fireworks that are often thought to be safe, such as sparklers, can reach temperatures above 1000 degrees fahrenheit, and can burn users and bystanders. Families should attend community fireworks displays run by professionals rather than using fireworks at home. The aap recommends prohibiting public sale of all fireworks, including those by mail or the internet. Don't use scented soaps, perfumes or hair sprays on your child. Avoid areas where insects nest or congregate, such as stagnant pools of water, uncovered foods and gardens where flowers are in bloom. If possible, eliminate stagnant water, such as in bird baths or fish ponds,",

In our opinion, it is definitely one of the best-of-british ways to welcome in the new year. Our judges have compiled an eclectic list that ranges from trendsetting teenagers to grand old men and everything in between. This is because being well-dressed is nothing to do with age or fashion. As keith richards says, you don't find a style, a style finds you. That's not to say that trends aren't interesting. In recent years, for example, we have seen the rise and fall of the pitti peacocks - the self-conscious dandies that lurk around florence during that city's biannual menswear fair, who have been replaced with a more relaxed take on sports luxe. And trend-wise right now it seems that we are witnessing the demise of the sock, as ankles remain bare even when the mercury falls.

The trump organization has penned a deal that lets it out of its ties to trump soho by the end of the year, bringing to an end more than a decade of local pushback, lackluster interest in its pricey per-night rooms and condos, and even allegations of possible fraud at the hands of the trump family. The trumps managed the hotel that bore their name, though it's actually owned by california investment company cim group. By cim buying out the trumps, the firm will be free to boost the current footprint of the hotel, first announced in 2006 on trump's show the apprentice, by scooping up more condos, then trying to sell it; it can also try to rebrand the property entirely. Fortune notes that even though the hotel has been \" dogged from the start by controversy, \" things seemed to get even stickier once trump became president, with celebrities like lebron james publicly noting they won't stay there, and its koi restaurant shutting down earlier this year because regulars stopped going. But even though the trumps may be looking forward to ditching what timothy o ' brien of bloomberg says has been \" an epically misbegotten and mismanaged project, \" he also notes the hotel has apparently already caught the eye of special counsel robert mueller, who may be looking into trump soho's possible role in any \" suspicious financial activity \" linked to \" russian operatives. \" \" like visitors to the hotel california ( cue the eagles ) — the trumps can check out of the trump soho any time they like, but they can never leave, \" writes timothy o ' brien.",

        "summary": "It sounds like a riddle: how can two boys be both brothers and twins but not share a birthday, or even a birth month? a kansas city mother has a rather miraculous answer to that question. Elene cowan gave birth to her fraternal twin boys nearly six weeks apart, and after 100 days in the neonatal intensive care unit, the boys, now 4 and 6 months old, are home, weighing in at more than 9 pounds a piece, and expected to do fine. Cowan learned her amniotic sac was bulging in the birth canal at 24 weeks; with doctors unable to halt her labor, she delivered son carl on jan. 20; he weighed one pound four ounces — so tiny his mother could slide her engagement ring up his arm. Cowan's doctor tells kobi he believes an incompetent cervix may have been behind the premature birth; he literally stitched her cervix shut and used medication and a special balloon to keep carl's brother, david, inside in the hopes of improving his own chance of survival. Cowan spent the next six weeks on bed rest, moving only to visit carl. When david came along 39 days later, on feb. 28, he weighed less than three pounds — and cowan thought he looked huge by comparison. She tells abc news they plan to celebrate the birthdays separately in \" remembrance of what they went through. \" while it is incredibly rare for twins to be born so far apart, fox4kc reports the guinness book of world records lists the longest stretch between the birth of one set of twins at 87 days, or almost three months. ( the news of cowan's twins follows that of a woman in boston who recently gave birth to twins 24 days apart. )",

The 18-year-old, who was recaptured in mexico on monday, will face a maximum punishment of 120 days behind bars because of what experts describe as a quirk in texas law, the dallas morning news reports. Tarrant county district attorney sharen wilson says that because couch's case is still in the juvenile system, he can either be held in a juvenile facility until he turns 19 in april, or he can have his case transferred to adult court, where he can be sentenced to a maximum of 120 days in adult prison, the ap reports. She describes the situation as the \" horns of a dilemma in texas law. \" couch had been serving 10 years on probation for the 2013 accident. Wilson says she plans to have his case transferred to adult court, where she will ask for \" every single possible condition of probation where we will know where he is at all times \" for the remaining eight years, the los angeles times reports. She says that if he violates those terms, she will seek a 40-year prison sentence — 10 years for every victim. Dallas lawyer david finn tells the times that because of the public outcry over couch blowing his \" second chance, \" prosecutors will do everything they can to have him sent to prison. He expects them to load couch up with probation conditions and then \" sit back and wait for him to fail. \" ( couch's mother will face charges for helping him flee the country. )",

He may have been off by a few million, but he was on the mark in one way: the telecast's tv audience was the smallest in history, the los angeles times reports. The ratings have been largely falling since 2013, when it had 17.7 million viewers; its previous record low was 11.37 million viewers in 2016. Last year, 11.4 million watched, and this year's average was down 10.5 % from that, to 10.17 million viewers, per nielsen.

The surveys involved a physical exam and this question: \" during the past 12 months, have you tried to lose weight? \" about half of the adults were overweight or obese at the start with a body mass index of 25 to above 30. A bmi of 30 or above is considered obese, per the cdc. The percentage of those overweight or obese rose throughout the study period from 53 % to 66 % by the end in 2014, per medical xpress. At the same time, the percentage of those trying to shed pounds dropped from 56 % to 49 %. Black women had the highest obesity rates and the sharpest drop in a desire to lose pounds, from 66 % to 55 %. While there is a bright side to fat acceptance, zhang says the findings are a \" serious concern, \" with obesity linked to serious health effects such as heart disease and cancer. Weight loss is \" really challenging, \" says zhang, per the daily news. \" let's forget 'fat, \"obese, ' all the bad words. … let's just try to engage in a healthy lifestyle: eating less and moving. \" ( this blogger posted \" before and after \" photos, but not the way you'd expect. )",

That woman is carolyn moos, herself a former pro basketball player, and today in cosmopolitan she tells her side of the story. She recalls being immediately attracted to collins when she met him at stanford university, particularly pleased that he, at 7 feet, stood taller than her 6-feet-5-inches. But they didn't start dating until after college, and their basketball schedules made it difficult for them to spend much time together during the season. Even so, \" we understood each other in a way that others couldn't, \" moos writes, recalling one instance when collins told her she was his \" soul mate \" and \" meant for him. \" finally, after seven years together, collins proposed in 2008 and they moved in together and started talking about their future family. Then, a year later and just a month before the wedding, he called it off. He offered \" no tangible reasons, no explanations \" for ending the relationship, moos writes. Four years later, she finally understood why, when collins called her to come out as gay. It was the same day his coming-out article appeared, though he didn't mention that to her. Though she empathizes with collins, moos says she's still \" deeply hurt by him \" and his failure to be honest with her earlier. \" he's being hailed as a pioneer, but i believe true heroism is a result of being honest with yourself and with those you love. \" ( meanwhile, with the nba's summer signing period having started a week ago, collins still doesn't have a new team, the new york times reports. )",

            "Brittney griner just led baylor to a 40-0 record and a national championship. She's an attractive woman with a quick smile, a well-spoken representative of her university who is quick, in every interview, to deflect credit to her less-known – and lesser abused – teammates, and who will return for her senior year in college rather than pursue a professional career. What a dreadful woman. Let's all pile on. Griner didn't ask to be 6 feet 8. She didn't ask for a low-pitched voice and size 17 feet. Of course, those are perfectly good reasons for total strangers to speculate about the gender of a 21-year-old college student. Shame on those who watched griner play and whose sophisticated thought processes led them to that question. Shame on those who heard her voice and speculated that she might be a man, or had been a man, or might become a man. Shame on those who have called her names and taunted her. I turned on wtem-980 the other day and thought, \"who the heck is that squeaky thing? \" before realizing it was me, on the tony kornheiser show. I've always had a high voice. Not a thing i can do about it. Mike tyson also has always had a high voice. No one ever thought he was"

It's also the deadliest strain and requires quick treatment, but doesn't show signs of being plague, cbs denver reports. Taylor's family made sure their son's name went public so anyone who attended the memorial service on their property would act on flu-like symptoms, says o'donnell.

        "summary": "A vancouver woman backed out of her agreement to buy a $ 6.1 million mansion after finding out an alleged chinese mob leader had been shot to death at its front gate, and on friday, a judge ruled in her favor in the ensuing court case. The house's previous owner, mei zhen wang, used \" fraudulent representation \" to sell it, the judge ruled, since would-be buyer feng yun shao was not informed of the murder before paying her $ 300,000 deposit. Only after the deposit had been paid in 2009 did shao hear rumors of the mansion's history; she and her husband searched online and found out what had happened, the cbc reports. After shao pulled out of the sale, wang sued her for breach of contract, arguing she should be able to keep the deposit and should also be paid $ 338,000 in damages since the house ultimately sold to someone else for just $ 5.5 million. Wang's daughter and son-in-law had lived in the 9,018-square-foot mansion; her son-in-law, raymond huang, was an alleged leader of a gang with roots in china and was killed in an apparent targeted hit in 2007. Media reports about his death led to his young daughter being removed from her school, and the family moved so that she could attend a new school. When shao asked why wang was selling, though, all she was told was that the family needed to switch schools so the girl could improve her english. \" that representation, while true on its face, was incomplete, \" the judge ruled, noting that wang was also likely concerned for the safety of any family still living there. \" ms. Shao was entitled to an accurate answer. \" shao's lawyer had argued when pulling out of the sale that since huang's murderer had not been apprehended, anyone living in the home would be at risk. Wang was ordered to return shao's deposit, plus interest, ctv news reports.",
