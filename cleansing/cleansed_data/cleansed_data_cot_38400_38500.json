A fight broke out and about 20 people got sprayed, komonews.com reports. One man was arrested for allegedly pushing a police officer. \" people have been maced. It's ridiculous, all for a shoe, \" said one shopper, who added that he waited in line \" because it was a christmas present, and it's the only thing i wanted. \" another shopper said the craziness was worth it because of the shoe's value; pairs were selling for up to $ 420 online. And washington wasn't the only place where things got crazy; tmz reports that there were also brawls in kentucky and north carolina. Fox 5 atlanta notes that at least four people were arrested at a mall outside that city when a throng of customers broke down a door to get into the mall before it opened.

            "There were people other than brad pitt at this morning's press conference for the cannes premiere of killing them softly, but you'd be forgiven for thinking otherwise, given how pitt was the single target of pretty much every question asked. The future mr. Jolie was a charming panelist, gamely answering whatever questions came his way, even when the cannes moderator tried to keep him away from all the fun topics. Every time a journalist queried him, pitt made sure he could stare deep into the questioner's eyes while answering ( those lucky dogs ), even once asking someone else to move out of the way so he could continue making eye contact with a reporter. He also got cheeky, sometimes simply answering \" no \" when the moderator asked if he had anything to say, then grinning as the room was overcome by awkward silence and nervous giggles. In the talky crime drama, pitt plays a professional \" enforcer \" who attempts to manage the aftermath when ray liotta's illegal gambling operation is robbed by up-and-comers scoot mcnairy and ben mendelsohn. There will be blood, and at the press conference, violence was a major topic. When a spanish journalist asked pitt if, as a dad, he had a problem playing a killer, he replied, \" not in any way, because",

' \" romney focused on obama's attempt to blame congress for inaction, pointing out that for most of his presidency, democrats controlled both houses. \"but we shouldn't forget that for two years, this president had a congress that could do everything he wanted, \" said romney. Romney also criticized the \" buffett rule \" that would require millionaires to pay at least 30 % in taxes: \" we need to encourage people to invest, \" said romney, who plans to pay half that rate on last year's income. Over on the libertarian side, ron paul also attacked the president's speech, criticizing him for continuing the current system — and for not mentioning the evil federal reserve. \" president obama claims to want an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules, \" wrote paul. \" yet he remains committed to the same old system of debt, deficits, bailouts, and cronyism that created our economic problems. \" gingrich released a statement responding to the state of the union, insisting, \" bigger government and higher taxes will not lead to jobs and growth. Bigger government and higher taxes will instead lead to more people on food stamps, a situation which the president and his party defend as a fair outcome....

In the washington post, 17-year-old gavin grimm says he used the men's room at his school for months after coming out as transgender until the school board got wind of it and held two \" humiliating and painful \" public meetings \" to discuss my genitals and restroom usage. \" after the gloucester county school board banned grimm from using the men's room, grimm won a court case to allow him to use the restroom that matches his gender identity, usa today reports. But the supreme court put the lower court's decision on hold last summer and will hear the case next year, likely reaching a decision by june. The justices'decision to hear the case means grimm won't be able to use the men's room during his senior year of high school, but he says he's willing to sacrifice if it means helping transgender students around the country. \" i hope the justices of the supreme court can see me and the rest of the transgender community for who we are — just people — and rule accordingly, \" he says in the post. \"the supreme court's ultimate decision in this case will have a profound impact on transgender youth across the country, \" the human rights campaign's legal director tells usa today.",

People reports the british singer was recently kicking back on a boat with american idol finalist adam lambert and other friends when lambert started recording their conversation, at one point training the camera directly on smith. \" i don't like michael jackson, but this is a good song, \" smith said as jackson's \" human nature \" played in the background. Lambert posted the clip to his instagram, though the swift reaction to smith's mj jab soon forced lambert to take the post down ( music news facts captured a copy before it was removed ). In general, that reaction was not kind to smith, especially since, as ew notes, the \" stay with me \" crooner has mentioned r&b singers such as mariah carey and whitney houston as influences on his own music. In addition to regular folks ripping on smith — with one describing the 26-year-old as a \" boring, mediocre, dull, middle of the road cringeworthy crooning sad sack \" — some bigger names also came to the late jackson's defense. \" don't come for michael jackson when you wish you have sold as many records and you wish you were the king of pop like he was, \" stephanie mills, star of broadway's the wiz who says she once dated jackson, posted.

Reporting in the journal cognition, they write that eye contact actually \" disrupts resources available to cognitive control processes during verb generation. \" in other words, when you need to come up with certain words under certain circumstances, maintaining eye contact depletes the very brain resources you need to find the word. So you look away. To test this, the researchers asked 26 participants to make eye contact with a computer-generated face while playing a word association game, reports business insider. Looking at the face didn't seem to interfere with their ability to come up with verbs easily associated to nouns — like the word \" scissors \" prompting the person to think of \" cut. \" but when nouns were more difficult — for example, if they had too many associations or were a little obscure — it took participants longer to think of a verb while maintaining that eye contact. As a post at science alert sums up: \" while making eye contact and holding a conversation is certainly possible, this is evidence that they can both draw on the same pool of cognitive resources, and sometimes that pool starts to run a little dry. \" the researchers didn't parse out possible cultural influences, but scientific american suggests that if looking away while thinking is cross-cultural, \" perhaps cultures with less emphasis on eye contact enable deeper thinking during a given conversation. \" ( eye contact is forbidden in a certain minnesota locale. )",

As of friday, stein had raised more than $ 5 million dollars for recounts in wisconsin, michigan, and pennsylvania. The money will go toward attorneys, filing costs, and recount observers. Momentum for the \" long-shot \" recounts in three states where the final vote was markedly different from polling is growing due to hillary clinton's massive lead in the popular vote and concerns about possible russian hacking. The clinton campaign hasn't commented on recount efforts. While stein eventually made friday's deadline in wisconsin, her wait until the last minute prompted skepticism on social media. \" jill stein at nordstrom, telling the sales girl she ' ll get one in each color, \" reads one tweet. \" a cackling jill stein floats off into the sunset in a massive golden blimp with'recount ' emblazoned on the side, \" reads another. The recount deadlines in pennsylvania and michigan are next week.",

        "summary": "Think you're a big eater? one breakfast cooked up at the bear grills cafe in congleton, england, is so daunting that only 20 people have tried it — and no one has successfully cleaned their plate. The chef tells the daily mail it's called \" the hibernator \" because \" if anyone completes it they ' ll have to sleep for a year. \" the 7-pound, 8,000-calorie meal is served on a 4-foot turkey platter and includes four fried eggs, a four-egg cheese omelet, eight sausages, eight strips of bacon, four hash browns, four waffles, four pieces of toast, four pieces of fried bread, four servings of black pudding ( blood sausage ), two scoops of beans, two of tomatoes, mushrooms, large fries, and a 2-pint milkshake. Grub street points out that the restaurant also offers a \" mini \" version for children. The man v. Food-style challenge will set you back roughly $ 33 and involves signing a waiver, being 18 or older, and acknowledging that you know what you're getting yourself into. Those who can finish the entire course in under an hour win $ 162, appear on the establishment's presumably small wall of fame, have the breakfast named after them, and can add an ingredient to the challenge. The chef says the breakfast has brought in a younger clientele, but he adds that even those who dare try it are crying to their friends on their phones just 20 minutes in. Meanwhile, esquire has a lot of questions about the monstrosity: \" why do you need or want to consume 8,000 calories shortly after waking up? or at any point in the day? why is it even a dare? why would you want both toast and fried bread? why is there a milk shake at breakfast? \" ( food-eating contests can certainly be deadly — though not always because of the amount of food. )",

It looked at six factors, among them product quality and how employees are treated. Among the leaders: no. 4: google. The online giant wins major points for excellent customer service and for being a \" worker's paradise. \" no. 3: disney. The land of mickey and minnie has had a score of more than 80 out of 100 for three years running, and is highly ranked for social responsibility and leadership. No. 2: apple. After winning the survey last year, apple slipped to no. 2 mostly due to some disappointing financial news. But consumers still love its products and customer service. No. 1: amazon. It clocked in at 8th in 2011 and 4th last year, but secures the top spot thanks to its industry-leading scores for emotional appeal, along with top-five scores for vision and leadership, financial performance, and workplace environment. On the other end of the scale, you ' ll find plenty of financial firms. Among the lowlights: no. 3: halliburton. Halliburton isn't earning many rave reviews by being at the forefront of the oil fracking industry. No. 2: goldman sachs. One of just two companies with a score below 50, goldman has been voted the least trusted company in america. No. 1: aig.

Another development to emerge: engineering students had to create their own door locks during the ordeal. The wednesday morning shooting caused confusion and panic on campus, the daily bruin reports, with rumors spreading about up to four shooters and dozens of victims. But despite warnings, some professors allowed students to enter and leave classes after a lockdown was announced, and students in the engineering building where the shooting took place were alarmed to discover that their classroom doors did not lock. The ap reports that the students put their engineering skills to work, improvising their own locking mechanisms using belts, chairs, and water bottles.

Nobody should like it, \" he said. \" we defend many of these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices.

While the 2016 figure is only \" a first look, \" as the cdc won't be able to figure out final numbers until december, it still shows \" the largest annual jump ever recorded in the united states, \" the times notes. Some states saw an even greater rise in overdose deaths. Large increases were seen on the east coast in maryland, florida, pennsylvania, maine, and ohio, where fentanyl and its analogues have been increasingly emerging in drug seizures. And in that state, drug deaths jumped by more than 25 % from 2015 to 2016. A separate report from the columbus dispatch notes overdose deaths doubled in the state's six largest counties in that period. In a sign that the problem is only getting worse, fox news notes montgomery county has, not even midway through 2017, already passed last year's total overdose death tally. Some western states, on the other hand, saw overdose deaths hold steady or even fall in 2016. That's likely because black tar heroin remains most prevalent there, as opposed to powdered heroin, which can be laced with fentanyl or carfentanil. Should powdered heroin reach western states, drug deaths will increase, a doctor tells the times. ( how west virginians are trying to battle the od ' ing epidemic. )",

        "summary": "Despite the fbi's firm assertion earlier this month that north korea was definitely behind the sony hack attack, not everyone has been satisfied with that conclusion. A chatham house cybersecurity expert, conservative blogger charles c. Johnson, a hacking conference security director, and plenty of theorists on twitter and reddit have all advanced postulations that don't point to north korea. But only cybersecurity firm norse was able to talk the fbi into a meeting yesterday, where company researchers proposed the hack was pulled off by an angry employee, perhaps working with piracy hackers, politico reports. The company's evidence, compiled partly using leaked sony hr docs, points to six people ( two in the us, one in canada, one in singapore, one in thailand ), including an employee who worked in a technical capacity and knew her way around sony's networks, the security ledger reports. Norse vp kurt stammberger says insider knowledge would explain how the hackers were able to access sony server ip addresses and passwords. Arguments already presented against north korea's culpability include that the malware and ip addresses used in the hack were easily obtainable and that the code supposedly used in previous north korea attacks was widely known in underground hacking circles, notes politico. But while the fbi isn't officially changing its stance based on norse's new info, an official said to be close to the investigation told reuters yesterday that the us now thinks north korea may have commissioned foreign hackers to assist it in the attack. And stammberger thinks the fbi is still open to ideas. \" if they weren't, they wouldn't take a meeting with us, \" he tells the daily beast. ( no matter who was behind the hack, john mccain says it's war. )",

But the bbc reports that sea shepherd is now being forced to cancel those efforts, noting it's been outplayed by japan's cutting-edge technology and deep wallet. \" japan is now employing military surveillance to watch sea shepherd ship movements in real time by satellite, and if they know where our ships are at any given moment, they can easily avoid us, \" capt. Paul watson, the group's founder, says in a statement. Per cnn, watson says his group's work was also stymied by new anti-terrorism laws \" specifically designed to condemn sea shepherd tactics \" and warnings from japan that they might send out military vessels to protect their whalers. Japan has continued to hunt whales, despite an international whaling commission moratorium that began in 1985. Watson says over the past 12 years, his organization's efforts have slashed japan's annual quota from 1,305 whales to 333. He also has a beef with the us, australia, and new zealand, three nations that publicly take japan to task for flouting the moratorium, but which watson says actually have \" hostile governments \" that are \" too busy appeasing japan, \" per the bbc. Watson tells the australian broadcasting corporation that's because trade deals are more important to those countries than conservation efforts.

The company isn't confirming anything, however. One of the mystery structures is being built on a barge floating off treasure island in san francisco bay, and investigative reporter daniel terdiman of cnet rounds up a boatload of circumstantial evidence suggesting that it is indeed google behind the four-story \" secret project, \" as the locals call it. What's more, various experts say the specs match perfectly with the concept of a floating data center, an idea that google patented in 2009. Among the advantages: such a center could not only draw power from the ocean but use its water to cool all those servers. The other mystery barge is now sitting in the harbor of portland, maine, reports the local press herald. It carries a secret structure of its own about the same size as the one in san francisco. The story floats a number of possibilities to explain it, with a google data center being one of them. It all seems to add up, writes chris taylor at mashable. \" keeping data in the oceans would cut millions from google's data storage costs, \" he writes. \" and it can't have failed to escape the company's attention that putting data centers in international waters would theoretically put it beyond the reach of government interference.

The two then walked off in separate directions, with the telegraph noting they'd allegedly had an argument. Blomfield walked for 5 miles before showing up, disoriented and dehydrated, in a mining camp, where she reported collis missing. Authorities initiated a search involving planes, helicopters, and aboriginal trackers and quickly found the couple's car and some of collis ' clothes and gear. But officials assumed collis was dead because he failed to appear on their heat-detecting devices. Little did they know that collis was undetectable because he'd buried himself in sand and leaves to protect himself from the cold, a trick he says he learned watching british adventurer bear grylls on television. Police officers found collis on sunday less than 2 miles from his vehicle. During that time collis survived by eating bugs and flowers, a trick he also learned from grylls.",

A proposed class-action lawsuit was filed against payless after livid customers banded together in a facebook group created to air their grievances over customers ' biggest beef: undisclosed fees. \" they use low rates online to get people to use them over other rental agencies, but when you get there, they slam you with additional fees, \" says one of the lawyers behind the lawsuit. Abc spoke to one plaintiff who claims he was promised a $ 217 rental over six days upon signing his contract, but was later slammed with a $ 528 bill filled with charges for insurance and protection he repeatedly turned down. In their own investigation, abc producers rented four cars from payless at different airports. Two of the rentals didn't include surprise fees, but at least one had additional charges slapped on ( a fourth was towed for its \" dangerous \" tires ). Payless declined interview requests from abc but said in a statement, \" we are investigating your concerns with your experiences to ensure that our employees'statements and conduct always remain consistent with our policies and procedures. \"",

In fact, roughly 80 percent of new-car shoppers shell out for it. That's meant huge profits for america's best-loved company. On the other hand, not everyone's a fan of the technology. After myford touch debuted in 2010, customers complained about how difficult and confusing it was to use. As a result, ford tumbled from #8 to #17 in j.d. Power's initial quality rankings. Since then, the company's scores have fallen further: this year, ford clocked in a depressing 27th. Now, california's center for defensive driving has filed a lawsuit against the automaker, alleging that the myford touch system in its 2013 ford f-150 experienced a host of problems, including \" system lockup and total system failure; periodic non-responsiveness to peripheral devices ( such as mp3 players and smartphones ); and periodic non-responsiveness to voice commands \". In total, the plaintiff claims that myford touch froze or failed at least 27 times. The plaintiff and its lawyers at grant &amp; eisenhofer p.a. Are seeking class-action status. Ultimately, they're suing ford for \" compensatory damages \" and hope to force the automaker to institute a recall",

The federal communications commission approved rules last year banning isps from doing just that, but on thursday, the senate voted along party lines, 50-48, to bar the fcc from enforcing those rules, even though the rules aren't set to go into effect until december. As nbc news reports, there's \" little immediate impact \" to the vote, as the house must first pass the measure and president trump would then need to sign it into law, and a house vote is not yet scheduled. Some of the discussion surrounding the vote: as nbc explains, google and facebook accounted for 90 % of all new online ad spending in the first half of last year, which means every other entity on the web has to compete for the final 10 %. Supporters of this measure say it will level the playing field somewhat for those companies. Online privacy advocates, however, oppose the measure; an aclu rep says the senate voted to \" sacrifice the privacy rights of americans in the interest of protecting the profits of major internet companies, including comcast, at&t, and verizon. \" the electronic frontier foundation is not happy, calling the vote \" a crushing loss for online privacy \" and urging consumers to act. But marketing groups are in favor of the move, adweek reports. The data &amp; marketing association thinks consumers should be, too: \" consumers understand the value that relevant ads provide, and put the value of the services they get for free on the internet at $ 1,200 per year, \" a rep says. For more details, ars technica has an explainer of how isps might be able to sell your web history.",

It was bestowed on her by irvine, calif., police, reports the los angeles times, who branded the sister she plotted to kill the \" good twin. \" now, after 19 years in prison for her conviction on charges related to the 1996 attack on sunny han and her roommate, the state board of parole has recommended the 43-year-old be released. The ap reports gov. Jerry brown has 120 days to decide whether to approve or reject that recommendation, and the orange county district attorney's office is leaning on him to do the latter, describing gina in a letter as \" very intelligent and still manipulative \" and a threat to society. The twins were co-high school valedictorians in campo, but their relationship broke down in the years that followed. Sunny accused her sister of stealing her bmw and using her credit cards. Prosecutors argued that gina wanted her sister dead and recruited two teens to make that happen. As gina waited in a car outside, archie bryant, 16, and john sayarath, 15, gained entry to sunny's apartment by pretending to sell magazines. They restrained her roommate, helen kim; sunny managed to call 911 before she was tied up. An lat article on the trial says the girls were put in a bathtub; receipts showed gina had bought twine, duct-tape, pine sol, and garbage bags. But police were quickly on the scene, and gina was sentenced to 26 years to life in may 1998. She claimed she never intended to kill her twin. Bryant was sentenced to 16 years; sayarath, to 8, reports the orange county register. ( this woman was arrested over her twin's death. )",

But scientists aren't sure whether this is actually good thing in the long run for the seals, because wind farms have unique dangers such as maintenance vehicles and noise pollution.

The supreme court today unanimously overruled the conviction of carol anne bond, a pennsylvania woman who spent six years in prison after being prosecuted under an anti-terrorism law based on such a treaty, the ap reports. Upon discovering that her husband had impregnated her best friend, bond had spread toxic chemicals around that friend's home. The friend easily avoided the chemicals, suffering only a minor thumb burn. \" the global need to prevent chemical warfare does not require the federal government to reach into the kitchen cupboard, \" john roberts wrote in the court's opinion, \" or to treat a local assault with a chemical irritant as the deployment of a chemical weapon. \" the justices felt so strongly about the case that clarence thomas, antonin scalia, and samuel alito all wrote their own concurring opinions, npr points out. In other high court news: the justices refused to hear an appeal from new york times reporter james risen, effectively upholding a lower court ruling forcing him to reveal an anonymous source from his 2006 book state of war. But just last week, the court also refused to hear a case that would have required jana winters of fox news to reveal her sources for a piece about the aurora shootings, leaving the issue somewhat murky. The court ruled back in 1972 that the first amendment doesn't protect reporters'sources. The court will hear a challenge to alabama's legislative districts map, which democrats contend is racially discriminatory, packing black democrats into a few districts to limit their influence. A lower federal court ruled 2-1 that the map was not discriminatory.",

        "summary": "Robocop is back after a lengthy hiatus, but most critics are wishing it had stayed in 1987. Powered by director josé padilha and backed by some strong acting talents, the movie has promise. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver, and according to one critic, it may have ruined a classic. \" there was plenty of room for improvement \" over the original flick, writes ian buckwalter at npr, and generally, the remake is \" well made, polished, and hits every mark. \" except that it's a bit of a bore. \" is it crazy to want a futuristic sci-fi action flick about a motorcycle-riding metal supercop to be just a little more fun? \" even with a \" big budget, strong cast, and star director, \" robocop probably isn't worth your time — in fact, it's \" a travesty of a classic, \" writes colin covert at the minneapolis star tribune, who says he watched the film with \" a rising sense of anguish. \" if you liked the original, \" avoid seeing this flimsy facsimile. \" joe morgenstern at the wall street journal says star joel kinnaman \" compels our empathy with a kind of macho melancholia, \" but the other cast members are more fun to watch. Even so, it ends up as \" an action adventure that's graphics-rich, logic-poor, coherence-challenged, and pleasure-impaired. \" plus, it has none of the clarity that made the original a classic. Cue stephen whitty to soothe the pain — somewhat. Writing for the star-ledger, he notes, \" like robocop himself, [ the movie ] doesn't seem quite as truly, organically alive as it once did. But it sure looks sleek, and moves pretty fast. And if you don't think too much, it almost feels like the real thing. \"",

        "summary": "The house oversight committee held its much-anticipated hearing on the benghazi consulate attack today, and as expected, the testimony was both explosive and unflattering for the administration. Perhaps the most gripping testimony came from ambassador chris stevens'top deputy, greg hicks, who said he'd known the attack was terrorism from the beginning — in part because stevens called him and said, \" greg, we're under attack. \" when hicks heard susan rice describe the events as a protest on television \" my jaw dropped, \" he said, according to fox news. \" i was embarrassed. \" more from the hearings: hicks says he got a call later from the same phone stevens had used. Unidentified libyans on the other end said that they were with stevens and that the us should come get him. But hicks had already been told stevens was dead — which he called \" the saddest phone call in my life \" — so he didn't follow their instructions. \" we suspected we were being baited into a trap, \" he explained. Hicks recalled a 2am phone call with hillary clinton, in which he briefed her on the attack and they agreed to evacuate their benghazi personnel, the ap reports. Another witness, state department counterterrorism official mark thompson, complained that the white house denied his request to deploy a special military \" fest team \" during the attack, in part because it wasn't sure what was happening. Hicks added that the pentagon denied a separate special forces team in tripoli permission to fly to benghazi. \" they were furious. I can only say, well i will quote lieutenant colonel gibson who said,'this is the first time in my career that a diplomat has more balls than somebody in the military. ' \" the third main witness, libyan regional security officer eric nordstrom, testified that the review board clinton set up to look into the incident turned a blind eye to the role senior state department leaders played \" before, during, and after \" the attack, bloomberg reports. Democrats from the start denounced the hearing as a partisan exercise, the la times reports. Rep. Elijah cummings called it \" a full-scale media campaign that is not designed to investigate what happened, \" but rather to throw \" unfounded accusations to smear public officials. \" the white house echoed those sentiments, saying it had handed over more than 25,000 pages of documents to various congressional inquiries.

One reason for the push: the nsa is terrified that snowden has, and might make public, documents related to its espionage against chinese leaders, the washington post reports. \" he got a lot, \" one senior intelligence officials says, but it was \" not even close to the lion's share \" of what the nsa is up to. They're also worried about glenn greenwald's assertion that snowden has entrusted encrypted documents to trusted people around the world, so that \" if anything happens to him \" they will be revealed, raising concerns that snowden doesn't control the data anymore. Given the intensity of the effort, experts have some advice for snowden: fly commercial. Unlike private or government jets, commercial airlines are free to pass through other countries ' airspace, reuters explains, which given the bolivian plane fiasco now looks critical.",

Ekaterina's pop is the 93rd richest man in the world, thanks largely to a fertilizer business, and he's worth some $ 9.5 billion.

And one of the topics in that chat makes zuckerberg bristle: a recent slam by apple ceo tim cook, described by business insider as a longtime \" frenemy \" of zuckerberg. \" we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer — if our customer was our product. We've elected not to do that, \" cook said in an interview with recode and msnbc, set to be released this week. Cook added he \" wouldn't be in this situation \" if he were the head of facebook, and that the social media giant needs more than \" self-regulation \" at this point in the wake of recent \" controversies over fake news, electoral interference, privacy violations, and a broad backlash to smartphone addiction, \" per klein. Zuckerberg tells klein that cook's remarks were \" extremely glib \" and \" not aligned with the truth, \" per vox. \" i think it's important that we don't all get stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you, \" zuckerberg says. \" because that sounds ridiculous to me. \" zuckerberg defends his company's ad-based model, as not all can afford to pay for the service, and says facebook can have an ad-dependent model and still care for customers. He's not totally out of sync with cook on regulation, though. \" i actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated, \" he told cnn last month. \" i … think the question is more, what is the right regulation rather than ' yes or no, should it be regulated? ' \" klein's interview with zuckerberg is here, including how zuckerberg says it will take \" a few years \" for facebook to \" dig through this hole. \"",

        "summary": "A south american airline is asking its employees to be on the lookout for a former guantanamo bay detainee who was resettled in uruguay after being freed by us authorities, the ap reports. The alert about syrian native abu wa ' el dhiab adds to a growing mystery about his whereabouts. Uruguayan authorities have insisted for weeks that he's visiting neighboring brazil — though the uruguayan interior minister says his exact location hasn't been known since june 6, per plus55.com — and that as a refugee he's entitled to leave uruguay, but brazil says there's no record of dhiab entering the country. A rep for colombia-based avianca airlines told the ap on monday that the alert was issued internally, but he declined to give further details. The alert, published by the argentine web news portal infobae, warns employees that dhiab may be using a fake passport. The image of the alert posted by infobae says the information came from brazil's anti-terrorism police. Dhiab — who plus55 notes was nabbed in pakistan in 2002 for supposed al-qaeda ties — is one of six ex-gitmo detainees resettled in uruguay in late 2014, but some of the men initially complained the government wasn't helping them enough; they also refused to get jobs, drawing criticism from uruguayans. Dhiab has been particularly vocal about his unhappiness there. Several weeks ago, uruguayan media began reporting he'd left the country. Government officials said he'd traveled to brazil, noting he hadn't broken any law and wasn't being sought. However, last week the us embassy in uruguay said us authorities were \" collaborating \" with brazilian and uruguayan authorities to locate dhiab. Human rights activist belela herrera says it's \" crazy \" to use the word \" terrorism \" in relation to dhiab, who was never charged by us officials and cleared for release. \" he has a valid identity card, issued by the uruguayan government, that allows him to go to other countries. He is not a fugitive from justice, \" herrera tells the ap.",

The times reports the hackers seemed to be after social security numbers and associated \" personal identifying information, \" but it notes that because of the \" breadth \" of the hack, the intention — espionage? commercial gain? — is unclear. Dhs said its intrusion detection system, known as einstein, spotted the hack; the breach was found in april, and it's unclear why einstein didn't spot it sooner ( one cybersecurity expert frames einstein as \" a failure at this point \" ).

        "summary": "So many people decided to #deleteuber after the company was accused of \" strike-breaking \" at jfk amid immigration ban protests over the weekend that uber had to develop an automated process for deleting accounts. Previously, when a user requested their account be deleted, the process was manual — a human employee actually had to carry it out. That led to complaints once #deleteuber started surging saturday and people began leaving en masse — some said that, though they requested their account be deleted, it was not. That's because uber got backed up in the flurry of requests, the new york times reports. In response, the company expedited an automated process requiring users to go through a two-step process to delete their accounts ( including a password check to avoid fraudulent deletions ). As the times notes, users may still get error messages if they have credits in their account or if they also have a driver account with uber. But, an uber rep confirms to mashable, \" anyone who requested that their account be deleted will have their account deleted. \" over at quartz, meanwhile, alison griswold argues that uber was \" in a bind \" during the situation at jfk and would have been condemned no matter what it did. Ultimately, she writes, the company \" did nothing wrong, \" but it's too late — it's been caught in the \" cycle of liberal outrage. \" and at the times, mike isaac notes that anyone who switched over to lyft might want to consider the fact that two big trump supporters ( peter thiel and carl icahn ) own substantial shares in that company, and that uber says it is setting aside $ 3 million to help drivers affected by the immigration ban.",

Some interpreted the alert as an opportunistic attempt to attract business, even though it was sent a half-hour after the protest. One twitter user, @bro_pair, saw the message and called widespread attention to it, resulting in the hashtag #deleteuber. The hashtag was trending on twitter widely in the united states for much of saturday night and sunday. Uber said its message was not an attempt to capitalize on the taxi drivers'strike, but a notification to users that the company would not be increasing prices at a time of high demand.

The shooter, identified as 20-year-old adam lanza, then killed himself. Early reports said his mother, nancy lanza, was a kindergarten teacher at the school, but that doesn't appear to be the case, reports mediaite. More of what's known so far: lanza's older brother ryan was initially named as the suspect by a law enforcement official, possibly because adam was carrying his brother's id. Ryan, who lives in hoboken, nj, was questioned, but authorities say he played no role in the shootings, reports the ap. Authorities say someone turned on an intercom in the school's main office, which captured the hysteria of what was happening when lanza first entered the building. It also gave everyone else in the school time to prepare. Most of the victims were shot in two first-grade classrooms. Three weapons were found in the school: a glock and a sig-sauer, both of which are handguns, and a.223 bushmaster rifle; a fourth was found outside the school, possibly in a car, reports ap. Nancy lanza was reportedly a gun collector, and the weapons may have been registered to her. An emotional president obama talked about the killings this afternoon. It's the second worst school shooting in us history, after virginia tech but deadlier than columbine. Adam lanza's father was stunned at the news.",

            "Facebook told congressional investigators on wednesday that it sold political ads during the 2016 u.s. Presidential election to a so-called russian troll farm that was looking to target american voters. \" in reviewing the ads buys, we have found approximately $ 100,000 in ad spending from june of 2015 to may of 2017 — associated with roughly 3,000 ads — that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and pages in violation of our policies, \" facebook chief security officer alex stamos said in a statement. \" our analysis suggests these accounts and pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of russia, \" stamos said. The revelation, first reported by the washington post, comes amid ongoing investigations into russia's interference in the u.s. Election, including the use of social media to spread fake news and propaganda. The ads -- both traditional advertisements and sponsored posts -- were intended to sow discord among the american electorate by amplifying \" divisive social and political messages, \" stamos said. These ranged from \" lgbt matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights. \" roughly one quarter of the ads were geographically targeted, stamos said, though a facebook spokesperson declined to specify the locations where those ads were targeted.

The discovery includes a pair of christian temples, one of which was built in 1280 and destroyed not long after. It was \" roofed with tiles and decorated with murals and stone carving( s ), \" says a researcher. The basement contained imported plates and bottles of byzantine, egyptian, or iranian origin. Also among the findings were \" a chinese glass hair pin, with a head shaped as a split pomegranate, and a fragment of a bone plate with a carved dragon image, \" the researcher notes. He also describes stone carvings from the temple, featuring images like a cross and a griffin clawing a lion. Ukek was founded by batu khan, a descendant of genghis khan, archaeology reports. It was part of batu's golden horde kingdom, which reached from europe to central asia. But the city was destroyed in the late 14th century in an attack by tamerlane, a ruler who took control of a great deal of the golden horde's lands.
