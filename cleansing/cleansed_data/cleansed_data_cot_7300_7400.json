        "summary": "Outgoing house speaker john boehner said sunday there would be no government shutdown, but if there turns out to be one anyway, nearly 70 % of americans would oppose a shutdown over planned parenthood funding, per politico. The findings, based on a quinnipiac university poll released monday, also reveal that 52 % of the 1,574 registered voters who took the poll between sept. 17-21 wouldn't support cutting off funding to the organization. Even 56 % of republicans wouldn't give the thumbs-up for a shutdown due to planned parenthood. What also came through quite clearly in the poll is how respondents were broken down by gender in how they viewed planned parenthood: while 60 % of women said they are against a cutoff of funding, only 44 % of men are. And although 44 % of the respondents overall said they had a \" favorable opinion \" of the group, women felt so in larger numbers ( 50 % ) than men ( 43 % ).

So they're baffled why they're being investigated for neglect by maryland's child protective services for allowing their 10-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter to play at a silver spring park, then walk a mile home — alone. Danielle and alexander meitiv tell the washington post that they follow a \" free-range parenting \" philosophy — letting their kids gradually make decisions and gain certain freedoms. \" we wouldn't have let them do it if we didn't think they were ready for it, \" danielle tells the post.

Danielle refuted the state statute that cps cited ( it appears to deal with leaving kids alone in a building or a car, not at a park ) and the investigation ended. However, when alexander dropped the kids off solo at the park in december, they only got halfway home before cops picked them up ( a neighbor had called 911 ) — and cps got involved again. Danielle tells reason.com that things have gotten \" outrageous, \" including a cop telling her husband in front of the kids that \" shots would be fired \" if he came downstairs carrying anything other than his id, and a social worker visiting the kids'school and questioning the kids without the meitivs ' permission. Neither the police nor cps would comment on the case, though a police spokeswoman tells the post, \" we have a responsibility... To check on people's welfare. \" the meitivs are set to meet with cps again next week. \" i think what cps considered neglect, we felt was an essential part of growing up and maturing, \" alexander says. \" we're being bullied into a point of view about child-rearing that we strongly disagree with. \"",

In other words, they think that they're still part of a community, but nobody is able to see or interact with them. The shadowban is useful in that rather than someone immediately being locked out and possibly retaliating by, for example, making a new account, the user fades away gradually due to the lack of interaction from other users.

Now, vindication. After a six-week investigation, toronto police on friday revealed that they are investigating the deaths — the two were found in a semi-seated position and hanging from a railing by their indoor pool via belts — as a double homicide, and a targeted one at that. \" i believe that they were targeted, \" said det.-sgt. Susan gomes in a friday press conference. The cbc reports on the specifics of the investigation so far, per gomes: authorities have amassed 130 witness statements, 150 pieces of evidence, and 2,000 hours of surveillance video. All that and we \" haven't developed any suspects, \" gomes said, reports the wall street journal, though she added that investigators had an \" extensive list \" of people to talk to still. The home that the couple was found in was on the market, and the national post reports gomes confirmed that authorities have the names of everyone who was able to access the realtor's \" lock box \" that permitted entry into the home. The journal charts some of the \" numerous foes \" barry sherman, who started the generic drugmaker apotex, had, including drug industry rivals that he was famous for suing and some cousins who argued, unsuccessfully, that they had been pushed out of the wealth apotex generated. The shermans ' children have hired private investigators; here's what they have found so far.",

        "summary": "On wednesday, the republican chairman of the house intelligence committee dropped the kind of bombshell that raises more questions than it answers. Usa today reports rep. Devin nunes says he's seen intelligence reports that show communications between president trump's team and unnamed others were \" incidentally collected \" by us intelligence officials. Incidental collection is what happens when us citizens happen to be recorded talking to foreign targets of surveillance, according to the atlantic. Nunes says the surveillance in the reports, which were apparently brought to him by an unnamed source, was not directed at trump or his team and was both normal and completely legal, cnn reports. \" nothing criminal at all involved, \" nunes says. But that didn't stop nunes from immediately informing the white house and holding a press conference, saying he was \" actually alarmed by \" the reports. Democrats immediately accused nunes of blowing \" what little credibility he had left \" by going to the white house before sharing the reports with the rest of the house intelligence committee. In fact, it's unclear if anyone besides nunes has even seen the reports. Rep. Adam schiff, the ranking democrat on the committee, says nunes ' actions represent a \" profound irregularity \" and questions whether nunes is working for the trump administration. And while nunes himself reiterates there was no wiretapping of trump tower — by barack obama or anybody else — trump says he now feels \" somewhat \" vindicated.",

        "summary": "A mysterious hooded figure isn't the only individual police suspect was involved in the murders of a couple, their son, and housekeeper in washington, dc. Investigators say at least two people were probably at the home of savvas savopoulos, 46, and his wife, amy, 47, as early as wednesday night and likely kept the victims bound until thursday afternoon. At that point, sources say savopoulos probably handed over whatever the killers were after. Wusa 9 reports money was missing from the home; the family also had a valuable art collection, nbc washington notes. The couple, their son, philip, 10, and housekeeper veralicia figueroa, 57, were found dead inside the burning home. Three had either stab wounds or blunt force trauma, fox news reports; one victim was bleeding from the head and smelled of gasoline. Police are continuing to investigate, including at the parking lot of a church in lanham, md., where the family's 2008 blue porsche 911 was found in flames. That's the last known location of one of the suspects. Police say the killers would have been well aware of the family's day-to-day schedule. Authorities found no evidence of forced entry at the home, which had an elaborate alarm system that was always on, another housekeeper at the savopoulos home says. She adds figueroa planned to retire next year and move back to her native el salvador, which she fled during that country's civil war, after helping to pay for her children's education from afar. Instead, relatives tell the washington post they ' ll greet her body when it arrives in the country in the next two weeks.",

After a 911 call tuesday in which women were heard screaming, police were dispatched to a home in clinton, mo., where all were shot, one fatally — and it was the wrong home. Lowe says the officers should have been sent to an entirely different town, windsor, some 20 miles away, reports the kansas city star, which notes it's unclear if the error was made by human or computer. A news release from the missouri highway patrol states, \" after confirming with dispatch the address of the residence, officers entered the house where they encountered the suspect, \" who shot at them, and later, \" further investigation revealed the phone number from the original 911 call came from an address in windsor. \" clinton police officer christopher ryan morton, 30, was killed. Lowe notes that while the officers were sent to the wrong house, \" the fact is [ the residents ] were in the act of committing crimes within that house. \" the ap explains the series of events: tammy widger, 37, greeted the arriving officers and said nothing was amiss and no one else was home. The officers entered the house anyway to verify all was well and found james waters inside; the 37-year-old began firing at police and was later found dead by the swat team that arrived on the scene. Widger was charged wednesday with possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver after drugs were allegedly found in the home. One more tragic twist: morton, an afghanistan veteran, switched his status with the clinton pd from reserve to full time in september — to fill the hole left by officer gary michael, who was killed during a traffic stop.",

        "summary": "Your lucky monopoly thimble is at risk of being replaced by a hashtag. Monopoly maker hasbro is asking fans of the classic board game to help choose eight tokens for a new token madness version of the 82-year-old game to be released this fall, with options like a hashtag and smiley face emoji. When it was first introduced in 1935, monopoly had six game pieces: the top hat, thimble, shoe, battleship, cannon, and iron; pieces like the horse and rider, purse, and lantern were later added but ultimately retired, per cool material. The current roster of eight pieces includes the scottie dog, shoe, battleship, race car, thimble, wheelbarrow, top hat, and a cat — which fans voted in as a replacement for the iron in 2013, reports gizmodo. All of those game pieces could still become part of the new game, but they face tough competition from 56 new options, reports cnn. These span from the modern ( computer, private jet, monster truck ) to the retro ( typewriter, gramophone ) and also include a bread loaf, bathtub, t. Rex, penguin, rubber duck, campfire, trumpet, surfboard, rollerskate, and bunny slipper. Fans have until jan. 31 to vote at votemonopoly.com, but should be aware of the relative gravity of their decision. \" if they get rid of scottie the dog it's over for me and monopoly, \" one fan says in a tweet, per time. \" the top hat in monopoly has magic powers. You can't lose with it, \" adds another. The chosen tokens will be revealed in march. ( how monopoly actually helped wwii pows escape. )",

It's not the first time the beach has performed a vanishing act. According to records, it previously washed away in the 1890s but was back by 1927, at which point a pier was built — and after which some luminaries, including novelist graham greene and a young angela lansbury, visited, reports the irish times. Ireland's beaches will be inspected next year, reports the irish post, and molloy hopes the beach will still be there and gain blue-flag status. It could be a boon for dooagh village, which one local explains has seen three hotels and the local shop close their doors in the beach's absence.

            "Pope refuses to commit himself to raising status of women in catholic church and makes ' joke ' about female subservience in his first interview with a female journalist since his election to the spiritual leadership of the world's 1.2 billion baptised catholics, pope francis dodged a string of questions about whether he intended raising the status of women in his church and made a joke about women being \" taken from a rib \". The pope said women were \" the most beautiful thing god has made \". And he added: \" theology cannot be done without this feminine touch. \" he agreed not enough was said about women and promised that steps were being taken to remedy the situation. But when his interviewer, the vatican correspondent of the rome daily il messaggero, franca giansoldati, asked him whether he could detect an underlying misogyny in the catholic church, francis replied: \" the fact is that woman was taken from a rib. \" giansoldati wrote that he then laughed \" heartily \" before saying: \" i ' m joking.

        "summary": "A lunar mystery that has persisted since 1959 has been solved, according to penn state astrophysicists. That was the year in which a soviet spacecraft captured the first images of the dark side of the moon — the side that always faces away from earth. While the side we see features dark flat areas known as maria ( nasa explains they're made up of a kind of rock known as basalt ), the photos revealed that the far side was, as one professor says, \" all mountains and craters. Where were the maria? \" now the researchers say they've figured it out, and that the answer stretches back to the moon's origins. Their study points to the giant impact hypothesis, which states that a mars-sized object hit the earth, and that parts of that object and the earth's outer layers then formed the moon — which, like the earth, was extremely hot. Since the moon was a lot smaller, it began to cool faster, or at least part of it did. The near side was exposed to the earth's boiling temperatures ( upward of 2500 degrees celsius ), while the far side was not. As penn state news explains, \" aluminum and calcium would have preferentially condensed in the atmosphere of the cold side of the moon, \" and over the course of thousands if not millions of years, these elements would have, after combining with silicates in the mantle and surfacing, created a hard, thicker crust than what the near side sees. Meteoroids were later able to punch through the near side's crust, releasing basaltic lava that created the maria. On the far side, however, the thick crust largely held, \" and no magmatic basalt welled up. \" the result: mountains and craters, but little maria.

Almost half of all children suspended from preschool more than once are black, according to a new department of education study, even though black students make up just 18 % of preschoolers overall. Until now, education advocates have focused on disparities among high school and middle school students, the ap reports. \" we think of 4- and 5-year-olds as being innocent, \" says one analyst. But \" schools are using zero tolerance policies for our youngest also. \" overall, black students of any age are suspended and expelled at a rate three times that of white students. Eric holder hailed the report, the department's first to examine the problem among children so young, as \" critical, \" saying, \" this administration is moving aggressively to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline. \" but some analysts tell politico that the report lumps together districts of different sizes and demographics. The data \" is cut in a way that hides as much as it reveals, \" one education advocate says.",

The 59-year-old educator had a stellar résumé that included extensive fundraising experience and years of work with international human rights groups. But one apparent accomplishment was omitted from the list: according to u.s. Officials, nu ' aymi also was working secretly as a financier for al-qaeda, funneling millions of dollars to the terrorist group's affiliates in syria and iraq even as he led campaigns in europe for greater freedoms for muslims. Nu ' aymi was one of two men identified by treasury department officials last week as major financial backers of al-qaeda and its regional chapters across the middle east. Although u.s. Officials routinely announce steps to disrupt terrorist financing networks, the individuals named in the latest case are far from ordinary. Both men have served as advisers to government-backed foundations in qatar and have held high-profile positions with international human rights groups. The second man, a yemeni, is heavily involved in his country's u.s.-backed political transition. Their alleged dual roles — promoting humanitarian causes and civil rights while simultaneously supporting extremist groups — reflect a growing challenge for counterterrorism officials attempting to monitor the torrents of cash flowing to islamist rebel groups in syria, current and former u.s.

        "summary": "This has been a rough week for the white house for reasons that have nothing to do with russia. Two big promises of president trump fell by the wayside, at least temporarily. In addition to the gop failure to scrap obamacare, trump reluctantly preserved president obama's nuclear deal with iran. The developments have resulted in a theme of coverage on wednesday: new york times: \" trump finds that demolishing obama's legacy not so simple, \" reads the headline. The story notes that obama's signature achievements on the domestic and international fronts, both of which candidate trump vowed to reverse, are still intact. Yes, trump has unwound notable obama initiatives through executive action ( including the paris climate accord, the keystone pipeline, and the tpp pact ), but he's struggling on matters in which he needs help in congress. Los angeles times: \" trump set out to uproot obama's legacy. So far, that's failed, \" reads the headline. The story covers the same ground, with david lauter writing that \" trump's unusual concentration on repealing what his predecessor did, rather than putting forward initiatives of his own, has also hampered his effectiveness to a remarkable degree. \" this could change as trump appointees increase at federal agencies, but only if trump begins focusing on his own administration's initiatives rather than obama's, writes lauter. Daily beast: \" trump keeps failing to destroy obama's legacy, as aides assure trump all is fine, \" reads the headline. The story asserts that trump's \" failure to make more legislative inroads is quickly becoming a defining feature of his first year in office. \" like the other pieces, it lays some of the blame on trump's unfamiliarity with washington, a factor that will obviously change over time. The story adds that trump aides are trying to shield trump by giving him an inflated sense of his progress. Sun sentinel: \" gop, trump fail to trash obama's legacy, \" reads the headline on an editorial, as opposed to a news story. It talks specifically about obamacare, complaining that \" senators were sent to washington to help the american people, not to get rid of obama's legacy. They need to do their job. \" washington post: its story illustrates a point made in other stories — that trump seemed out of touch with gop opposition to the health care bill. A monday night dinner with senators was a casual affair that focused on small talk, not policy, even as the deal was falling apart at that very moment",

In updated guidelines released wednesday, it inched the recommended age to 45. Npr explains that doesn't mean getting a colonoscopy. The new recommendations detail six screening options, which include kits that allow patients to collect a sample at home and send it directly to a lab that looks in the stool for microscopic blood — the presence of which would then likely necessitate a colonoscopy. A press release notes there has been a 51 % rise in colorectal cancer among the under-50 group since 1994. Compared to those born around 1950, those born around 1990 have two times the colon cancer risk and four times the rectal cancer risk. \" we just have to face reality, \" says dr.

        "summary": "The nation's first primary has begun — and the only thing that appears certain is that new hampshire will deliver different winners than the iowa caucuses did. Some factors to watch out for in the state's 100th primary: bernie sanders looks like a sure thing, according to the forecast at fivethirtyeight, which puts his chances of winning at more than 99 %. The senator from neighboring vermont has a double-digit lead in the latest polls, politico notes. According to fivethirtyeight's calculations, donald trump has a 70 % chance of winning the gop race, with john kasich and marco rubio tied in second with a 10 % chance each. Jeb bush has a 6 % chance of winning, while ted cruz has a 4 % chance of repeating his iowa victory. Npr explains how people casting anti-trump votes could end up helping him. It's because of a state \" threshold \" rule: candidates must get at least 10 % of the vote to be awarded any delegates — if they fall short of that percentage, their delegates go to the overall winner, likely trump. The new york times takes a look at the state's undeclared voters, who are largely still undecided about which party's primary they're going to vote in, let alone which candidate. Such voters make up around 40 % of new hampshire's electorate and helped swing the state for hillary clinton in 2008 and john mccain in 2012. A winter storm has been causing havoc in the region, but officials tell the union leader that they've had elections in \" much worse weather \" and snow probably won't affect turnout too much. The washington post takes a look at what the candidates had to say about each other on their last day of campaigning in the state. It got pretty nasty, with trump telling a crowd that they \" have to get rid of the bushes of the world. \" if chris christie and john kasich have any road at all out of iowa, it ' ll be a tough one, politico finds in a look at what the governors will have to do to stay relevant in the month ahead. The boston globe looked for the most accurate bellwether in the state and found it between lake winnipesaukee and lake winnisquam. The small city of laconia has been within 5 % of the statewide results in every primary this century.",

Researchers from the university of michigan's sleep and circadian research laboratory tracked 171 college-age women over 14 days and found that those who got more sleep had more — and better — sex, with every extra hour of sleep raising the likelihood of having sex the next day by 14 %, cbs reports. The \" intersection of sleep and sexual functioning \" has been largely overlooked since a few studies in the 1960s, the researchers write in the study published in the journal of sexual medicine. More sleep boosted sexual desire even when factors like changes in mood were controlled for, reports the new york times. The study's lead author says that while snoozing won't provide a magic fix for sexual problems, people experiencing issues should definitely make sure they are getting enough sleep. \" if there's anything women or their partners can do to help promote good sleep for one another, whether it's helping out around the house to reduce workload, planning romantic getaways, or just practicing good sleep hygiene, it could help protect against having problems in the bedroom, \" he tells cbs.

She was 76. Ricky stachowicz, the general counsel for mrs. Johnson's family office, said she died after a long illness, which he did not specify. Mrs. Johnson — she preferred mrs. To ms., mr. Stachowicz said, and was known as basia ( pronounced bosh-uh ) — lived a fractured fairy tale of a life. When she arrived in the united states from poland in 1968, she had perhaps $ 200 in her pocket. She spent her first night in new york city in a dingy hotel room. Through a series of serendipitous connections, she was hired shortly thereafter as a cook by esther underwood johnson, better known as essie, the second wife of j. Seward johnson sr., heir to the johnson &amp; johnson band-aid and baby powder fortune. Photo miss piasecka was not much of a cook, it turned out, so her duties at the johnson estate in oldwick, n.j., became more of a maid's. She left in 1969 to take art classes at new york university; mr. Johnson set her up in a manhattan apartment, and later moved in with her. In 1971, mr. Johnson divorced his wife and married miss piasecka. She was 34; her husband was 76. None of mr. Johnson's six children were invited to the wedding. During their 12 years of marriage, mrs. Johnson, who had studied art history in poland, created a valuable collection of flemish tapestries, 18th-century furniture and paintings and drawings by rembrandt, botticelli, fra angelico, raphael and others. Together they built a 140-acre estate in princeton, valued from $ 20 million to $ 30 million, and called it jasna polana — \"bright glade \" in polish — echoing the name of leo tolstoy's russian home.

It seems the cathay pacific passenger jet was over japan on nov. 29 when its crew saw the north korean ballistic missile re-enter the atmosphere and crash into the sea of japan, reports the guardian. \" be advised, we witnessed the dprk missile blow up and fall apart near our current location, \" said the chief pilot, using the acronym for north korea, per the south china morning post. The crew advised air traffic controllers in japan, but their jet was far enough away that no course changes were necessary. It turns out that a cathay pacific cargo jet was even closer to the missile, though it was unclear whether that crew had seen it as well. \" operation remained normal and was not affected, \" says a statement from the hong kong airline. \" we remain alert and review the situation as it evolves. \" it was unclear how many passengers were aboard the plane at the time. Cnn notes that many cathay pacific jets have cameras mounted outside that allow passengers to see the view, but the airline didn't say whether the missile had been recorded. The relative close call raises the question of whether airlines flying in the vicinity need to consider altering routes or otherwise take precautions. One hong kong lawmaker, a former pilot, suggests that a panel be created that would coordinate intelligence about possible north korea tests with the aviation industry.",

After the company was criticized last year for including underwear and whisky flasks in its navajo line, a spokesman said the chain had no intention of changing its products. \" the native american-inspired trend, and, specifically, the term ' navajo ' have been cycling through fashion, fine art and design for the last few years, \" he told ap.",

        "summary": "President trump's surprise announcement of a meeting in may with north korea's kim jong un has led to all kinds of speculation about how things might unfold, and one piece getting attention is by victor cha, a former national security council director. In the new york times, he lays out two possibilities of what trump might offer. One is \" incremental \" assistance and the lifting of sanctions if kim agrees to freeze and eventually dismantle his nuclear and long-range ballistic missile programs. But cha thinks trump might be more tempted by a \" big bang \" idea — denuclearization in exchange for a peace treaty and diplomatic normalization of relations. Cha lays out both scenarios and warns that a disastrous meeting could actually \" take us closer to war. \" other views and developments: like he planned it? the meeting is \" a stunning vindication of the president's strategy, \" writes robert charles at fox news. He credits trump's \" engaged, creative and blunt approach \" for securing the meeting. A denuclearized korean peninsula is a long shot, but if trump pulls it off, he would secure global stature on par with ronald reagan, writes charles. \" donald does it again! \" declared a headline at drudge.

        "summary": "A stanford swimmer found guilty of sexual assault may have snapped photos of his unconscious victim's breasts while assaulting her — and sent the pics to friends in a group chat, cosmopolitan reports. According to police, a witness who saw brock turner, 20, standing over the woman's body during the assault said turner was pointing his phone at her. \" the cell phone had a bright light pointed in the direction of the female, \" the witness is quoted as saying, \" using either a flashlight app on the phone or its built in app. \" when the witness approached, turner apparently left for a while and returned to continue the assault. That's when two swedish men came by on bicycles and grabbed turner when he tried to flee. Santa clara police then spotted a text message on turner's phone after the arrest, abc news reports. Per the police report, cops saw the message \" sent to turner in the groupme application that said ' who's t --- [ breasts ] are those? ' \" police got a search warrant but couldn't find the text or any related photos ( possibly because groupme messages aren't stored and can be deleted by others in the group, cnn notes ). A screen grab of the actual message, published by the daily mail, shows that it's written in the singular ( \" whos t -- is that \" ) — which could matter, because the rape survivor's bra was disheveled and raised over her left breast. Still, says cosmo, it might have been another groupme friend who sent out photos of another woman's breast. ( the survivor's sister says turner tried forcing himself on her, too. )",

Now, fitbit and google data could help resolve the case. Attorneys for george burch, 40 — who is alleged to have killed nicole vanderheyden outside her ledgeview home on may 21, 2016 — say it was actually vanderheyden's boyfriend, douglass detrie, who killed the 31-year-old after a night out, reports the daily beast. Detrie was initially arrested after vanderheyden's body, with signs of sexual assault, was found in a field three miles from her home. But authorities say they've cleared detrie. Not only did burch's dna appear on vanderheyden's body and the cord used to strangle her, but fitbit data shows detrie was inactive when the murder took place, prosecutors say, per the green bay press gazette. After attending a concert with vanderheyden and friends, detrie became separated from the group. He says he then began receiving angry texts from vanderheyden, who'd been drinking heavily. Friends who went with vanderheyden to a bar say she got upset and left. Detrie, who friends described as worried, claims he went home and fell asleep around 3am. Only 30 minutes earlier, burch had left a bar where his lawyers claim he met vanderheyden. Google dashboard data shows burch then visited vanderheyden's home and two sites where her body and clothing were found, prosecutors say. Beginning this week, defense attorneys are expected to argue detrie killed vanderheyden when he found her with burch in a car outside the couple's home, then forced burch to dump the body at gunpoint.",

Two weeks ago, the 34-year-old teacher at the private woodlawn school, near davidson, flew to chihuahua, in north central mexico. He went there for his latest adventure, said his younger brother kerry braxton-andrew. \"in previous travels through latin america, he had heard from other backpackers that the el chepe train, which is the train that travels through the copper canyon national park, is just a really amazing trip.

And while it was impossible to master every factor in the \" hideously complicated \" set of coffee-brewing variables, the researchers were able to make some inroads in the drip-coffee process in a study published in the siam journal on applied mathematics. Making the experiment challenging is that coffee comprises about 2,000 chemical compounds, the subjectivity of individual preferences, and the fact that each step of the brewing process can affect how the beverage turns out — from the water temperature and how fast it flows, to how densely it's packed and how long it's brewed. And so the researchers concentrated on an easily measurable variable: the size of the grind. What they discovered is the larger the grounds, the better the hot water was able to flow in between them, minimizing bitterness. What you ' ll lose with that bigger grind, though, is the caffeine boost, as smaller grinds offer more of a wake-up wallop. Lead author kevin moroney also notes the ideal molecule extraction from a coffee bean is 20 %. The researchers note it may be impossible for the average joe to maximize his joe with this info, but they point out that coffee-machine makers are likely paying close attention to the math. \" our overall idea is to have a complete mathematical model of coffee brewing that you could use to design coffee machines, rather like we use a theory of fluid and solid mechanics to design racing cars, \" co-author william lee tells the bbc.

His car was found on fire around 30 minutes after the theft. Authorities say that before he disappeared, jakubowski sent a 161-page manifesto to president trump that was full of \" anti-religion sentiment \" and a \" laundry list \" of grievances against the government and upper class. Jakubowski has been \" highly agitated by national politics \" and \" believes that the government, and law enforcement in particular, are acting as terrorists and are enslaving the people, \" says rock county sheriff robert spoden, per the janesville gazette.

Raphael schumacher, 27, was taking part in a live theater performance of \" mirages \" at the teatro lux in pisa, italy, last saturday when a spectator found him unconscious. The washington post reports the play was viewed in sections in different parts of the theater with audience members moving between scenes. A single spectator watched in a courtyard as schumacher recited a monologue about the angst of a 15-year-old boy, stepped on a cube, and placed his head in a noose hanging from a fig tree, reports il tirreno. A medical school graduate — it isn't clear if she was the original spectator — then saw schumacher's body twitching and rushed to help, reports ansa news. Schumacher — who never regained consciousness and was declared brain-dead at a local hospital on thursday, per the bbc — changed the original ending of the scene, which was supposed to involve a gun, says a teatro lux manager. \" raphael changed it without telling us. \" but a prosecutor says the scene \" was performed successfully earlier on saturday evening, when he ended the scene laying his head in the noose. \" schumacher's family members don't believe it was suicide. \" his father died recently and he had just broken up with someone, but he had soon regained inner peace, \" his mom says.

That would be fbi director christopher wray, who will have 35,000 fbi employees watching his reaction after the memo on alleged surveillance abuses was revealed to the public despite his warnings. While wray hasn't tipped his hand on his next move, insiders note his frustration at being chosen by trump as a \" man of impeccable credentials, \" then ignored and portrayed as politicizing the russia investigation, per cnn. Before the release, sources told cnn that white house aides were nervous wray would resign if the memo were released, though white house counselor kellyanne conway told fox news friday that trump isn't worried that will happen, per politico. It's a move many ex-colleagues also don't anticipate. \" he ' ll tough this one out, \" a former doj co-worker tells politico, adding, \" he has great fidelity to the doj in general and the fbi in particular, and he will understand his leadership is needed. \" others don't think the memo release would even be a big enough deal in wray's mind to result in his leaving.

I wish more of our leaders would. \" ( comey also had something to say on \" weasels and liars. \" ) even though wray's working style isn't seen as being especially combative, wray is said to now be in \" raising hell \" mode. \" i think chris wray's motto is speak softly but carry a big stick, \" an fbi source tells cnn.",

Current tv hasn't announced the complete numbers for monday's show, but it said the program managed 179,000 viewers in the all-important 25-to-54 demographic advertisers crave. Current is happy with the rating, but mediaite notes that it's a fair step below the 237,000 lawrence o'donnell scored in olbermann's old slot on msnbc. The rating also put olbermann behind fox news and nancy grace's show on hln. He beat out cnn's in the arena, but host eliot spitzer is on vacation this week. It's not inconceivable that ratings could go up, but it is unlikely — most shows see ratings fall off after their debut, as curious samplers lose interest.

But pot permeates the rest of cannacamp: there's a thc fusion cooking class, 4: 20 community hour ( \" our version of happy hour \" ), cannabis yoga, cannabis-infused massages, cannabis pairing dinners... And so on. And then there are the outdoors. As mashable explains, most state and national parks prohibit toking, which makes cannacamp's pot-friendly trails unusual. \" we're bringing an element of luxury to that adventurous, exploratory vibe of childhood summer camp, \" is how joel schneider, ceo of the group behind the resort, frames it.

As necn notes, it's not clear what condition gagne was in before he was struck. \" we do know they were drinking alcohol, but to what extent, we couldn't say at this point, \" says police chief mark pawlina. Gagne's friends expressed shock: gagne, a senior at new york's st. Lawrence university, was a star lacrosse player and high school ski-racing champ who \" took really good care of himself, \" says one of his classmates and close friends. \" it wasn't like him to drink too much or to be by himself.

But the skies would blacken, our crops would die, and the darkness would keep us from sowing new ones. ( yes, led-light-equipped grow houses would persist, but they couldn't feed the world. ) how does humanity survive? that's the question tackled by joshua pearce and david denkenberger in the book feeding everyone no matter what. As pearce explains to nautilus, his research into that question found a single answer: store a ton of food. The problem is that in the authors ' view, a global catastrophe would necessitate five years ' worth of supplies, and stockpiling that isn't feasible from an economic standpoint, they explain in a press release. ( gizmodo says they estimated doing so would cost a family of four $ 12,000. ) pearce and denkenberger say they have \" two primary classes of solutions \" that would get us to that five-year mark — and require a lot of chainsaws. \" we can convert existing fossil fuels to food by growing bacteria on top of it, \" says pearce. We'd then \" either eat the bacterial slime or feed it to rats and bugs and then eat them. \" the second option, which he views as easier, is to feed rotting wood fiber to \" beetles or rats and then feed them to something else higher on the food chain. Or just eat the bugs. \" as pearce tells nautilus, we'd need a lot of chainsaws to fell what would essentially be a planet of dead trees. And if temps plummeted to 20 degrees amid the darkness, all of canada's wood would essentially be frozen. \" that's why global cooperation is so important, \" says pearce. \" because we'd basically be harvesting wood supplies from the equator. \" ( read about the \" doomsday vault \" in norway. )",

Designers say the technology is weather-proof and the arm will rise automatically when one car passes another, sky news reports. The rails are also said to be safe to the touch. \" one of the most important issues of our time is the question of how to make fossil-free road transportation a reality, \" says eroadarlanda chairman hans säll. \" we now have a solution that will make this possible, which is amazing. \" among its pluses, säll says the electric road lets vehicles have smaller batteries and therefore makes vehicles cheaper to produce. The $ 7.7 million project will be tested with a truck fleet for two years, and if the government approves, it could be implemented for $ 1.9 million per mile and include buses and cars. \" sweden is at the cutting edge of this technology, which we now hope to introduce in other areas of the country and the world, \" säll says.

The premise was straightforward: the two nations used it to keep their pilots from colliding in the cramped airspace over syria. And cramped isn't an overstatement: those skies are filled with pilots from the us-led coalition, the syrian government, and russia, which has been waging an air campaign on behalf of syria. Things were dicey even with the coordination in place: in january, a wall street journal report described the situation as \" an international incident waiting to happen \" after interviewing us pilots involved in close calls. \" this is very risky, \" says the head of the russian international affairs council, per bloomberg. \" this agreement helped to avoid direct military confrontation in this difficult situation. We don't want to start world war iii. \" the us ran its end of the line out of a military base in qatar, where air traffic controllers and military officials shared information with their russian counterparts in syria.

Flying cars are going to be a while, but it looks like our ip numbers are finally up: the american registry for internet numbers, the group that hands out the numerical codes, says there are only 3.4 million ipv4 addresses left, and the group's president says the supply will probably dry up by summer, the wall street journal reports. Major companies like amazon and microsoft are scooping up remaining addresses while they can, while others such as facebook decided to bite the bullet and simply upgrade to the newer ipv6 system ( ipv5 never really took hold ). It's not exactly an online end times, as dire as it sounds: asia depleted its supply of ipv4 addresses in 2011, europe the following year, the journal notes. And there's quite a bit of capacity under the newer ipv6 system — it can accommodate up to 340 undecillion ( 340 followed by 36 zeros ) addresses. The main obstacle to upgrading right now seems to be the expense, not resistance to more advanced technology: a companywide migration can cost about 7 % of the firm's annual it budget, per research cited in the journal. To see if your internet connection supports ipv6 and/or check out ipv6-only websites, slate points you toward the test-ipv6.com site. ( we haven't exactly been blindsided with this news, either. )",

            "A flying car crashed during a test flight in slovakia on friday. The aeromobil car was piloted by stefan klein, a co-founder of the company. Klein was able to deploy a parachute for the vehicle, which is said to have helped ease the severity of the impact. Witnesses near the nitra janíkovce airport described seeing the flying car go into a tailspin before the parachute was deployed. Klein was taken to the hospital and released without any serious injuries. However, the flying car wasn't so lucky. Judging by the photos taken at the scene, the vehicle sustained fairly serious damage. If the aeromobil name sounds familiar, that's because it has been the great flight hope of flying car nerds recently. The vehicle has been featured prominently in magazines and newspapers around the world, with promises that the flying car is now just around the corner. The company has even claimed that they could release the vehicle by 2017. For what it's worth, the company is putting on a brave public face, saying that crashes are all part of the struggles to get experimental vehicles operational. \"the detailed data",
