The record, which took from 2006 to 2013 to make and features contributions from every surviving member of the group, has been stored in a vault in morocco for most of the time since it was completed. Now, paddle8 auction house says an american buyer purchased the sole copy for \" millions, \" though no further details about the sum were given, the guardian reports. Forbes notes that the price was agreed to back in may, but the announcement wasn't made until this week because contracts and legal agreements were being sorted out. \" we hope that the impact of this historical sale will echo through the ages and maybe remind us every now and then that music is a great art form that should be valued as such, \" says wu-tang founding member rza, who says a significant portion of the proceeds will go to charity. Before its sale, the moma ps1 art gallery hosted a listening event at which an audience heard a 13-minute medley of the album's tracks, the only time the public heard any of the 128-minute record. The terms of the sale dictate that the buyer not make the album public for at least 88 years. Prior to this, the priciest single record ever sold was a rare acetate recording of elvis presley's first song, which jack white bought for $ 300,000.",

Rathburn had been selling or renting parts from bodies donated to science to researchers for decades, according to reuters. The detroit free press reports he was indicted on fraud and other charges in 2016 following a years-long investigation. Court records show a human body, when cut into parts, can bring in $ 10,000 to $ 100,000, and there are no federal regulations covering so-called body brokers. However, rathburn is accused of buying bodies infected with hiv, hepatitis, and other diseases at a discount and fraudulently providing them to researchers without disclosing the infections. An anesthesiologist testified that doctors won't accept such bodies due to health concerns. The government started investigating rathburn after he shipped a human head from tel aviv to chicago inside a trash bag in a cooler. Rathburn allegedly lied about the pooling liquid in the cooler being listerine and the head having been embalmed. Rathburn's ex-wife has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is acting as a witness against him. Rathburn's lawyer says she is \" most responsible \" for any alleged wrongdoing.",

Abc news and ktrk report on how 18-year-old jackie garza was fretting about how to get her dad, trinidad garza, not to shutter la casa bakery and cafe, which he opened in houston two years ago after a lifelong dream of owning such a place. Business had dropped drastically after hurricane harvey, and the elder garza, who's in his early 70s, decided it was time to pack it in. That's when jackie took to twitter to see if she could drum up some support. \" hey yall my dad has a little panaderia/restaurant, \" she tweeted on dec. 6, adding he was \" thinking about closing but i cant let that happen. \" she asked people who saw her tweet to retweet it to bring in new customers. And retweet twitter users did, at least 67,000 times by the most recent count. Jackie says they've heard from people from all over the world who were touched by their story, and customers have been flocking to the bakery, with lines out the door. Two days after her tweet, they posted that they'd nearly run out of trinidad homemade bread, buzzfeed notes; business has been brisk since. Trinidad says he was \" surprised \" by the reaction, which has spurred jackie to create a twitter and yelp page for the bakery, as well as start work on a website. She told ktrk she plans to go to college for business and restaurant management and eventually take over the bakery — which trinidad says he knows she ' ll successfully do one day.",

Nothing has been found since that april 2015 decision, but there is a new theory, from the search team led by dutch engineering group fugro. Project director paul kennedy tells reuters it's possible the plane, which vanished while traveling from beijing from kuala lumpur with 239 board, was manned at the very end. That would change its trajectory, with the plane not diving but gliding — for a distance as long as 120 miles, says kennedy — into the water after its fuel had run out. The working theory has been that there was no one at the wheel during its final descent, and reuters identifies kennedy's comments as the first time officials involved in the search have suggested otherwise. Bloomberg reports malaysia, china, and australia are meeting thursday to discuss the status of the search, which has thus far covered more than 90 % of the designated search area. Getting behind the new theory \" could mean combing an area almost as big as california for the best part of a decade, \" explains bloomberg. As for the possibility the searchers just missed the plane's wreckage, the australian transport safety bureau said in an email the search has been so precise even lumps of coal on the ocean floor have been identified.",

Russia — accused by the obama administration of testing said missile in 2014 — has tried to escape the agreement in recent years, with vladimir putin claiming in 2013 that \" nearly all of our neighbors are developing these kinds of weapons systems. \" however, it has denied any violations and accused the us of its own breaches. A nato official says non-compliance with the treaty banning ground-launched intermediate-range and short-range missiles \" is a serious concern for the alliance \" but \" nato allies have the capabilities in place to ensure that russia will not gain any military advantage. \" still, some — including mccain — are calling for the us to take action by expanding missile defenses in europe or deploying its own nuclear missiles, per the bbc. The state department says russia \" remains in violation \" of the treaty but has not said how it plans to respond.

Both times leakers said they doubted they'd be caught. \" but people who leak — whether they're apple employees, contractors or suppliers — do get caught and they're getting caught faster than ever. \" apple's crackdown is nothing new, however. Other silicon valley companies target leakers, and last year apple gathered employees to warn about leaks — which was privately recorded and leaked to the media, notes techcrunch. Such warnings could make apple workers more afraid of whistleblowing, an analyst warns, while a fired google employee's lawyer says the line is blurring between permitted conversations ( about poor working conditions, say ) and illegal leaks. But apple says the real enemy may be the media: \" people who work for apple are often targeted by press, \" the memo reads. \" while it may seem flattering to be approached, it's important to remember that you're getting played. \" read the whole memo at bloomberg.",

        "summary": "Emergency personnel have raced to fix a procedural issue that may have tipped off austin bomber mark conditt, who blew himself up as police closed in. Officers staked out conditt's pflugerville home while he was out on march 20, with plans to arrest him when he returned, and notified austin-travis county ems officials that their services might be needed, reports the austin american-statesman. Ems officials were to wait nearby. But a routing of the request by a computer system meant two medics from the pflugerville fire department didn't receive proper instructions. In a move police fear tipped off conditt to the surveillance, the medics knocked on conditt's door, thinking someone needed help, and one of conditt's roommates answered. Conditt was killed a day later when he detonated a bomb in his vehicle, stopped by police near a hotel. \" it wasn't a mistake by the pflugerville fire department, \" ems chief of staff jasper brown says of the mix-up, per the american-statesman. He explains a specialized ems crew normally responds to such calls and communicates with police via telephone. But \" we have never done that for surveillance only, \" brown says, noting a supervisor's request for the crew was denied. A call was then logged in a computer system, which routed it to the pflugerville department. By the time police instructions were relayed, the medics had already visited conditt's home. In the future, brown says a plan will be formed with police before similar requests are entered in the system, which now has a feature preventing automatic call routing. Other areas might be improved, too. \" we have to look at a way to make ourselves more resilient and stronger coming out of this, \" interim austin police chief brian manley tells ktbc.",

            "- it has been almost two weeks since the austin bomber killed himself as police approached his vehicle. During that time, interim austin police chief brian manley has met with members of the community and his department to reflect on the investigation. \"that was the most complex case that i have worked in my entire career, \" manley said. More than 500 federal agents joined austin police officers to put together every piece of evidence that could possibly identify a suspect. \"the partnership amongst the agencies that may not always get along was tremendous. Egos were left at the door, titles were left at the door, agencies were left at the door and everybody worked together to keep austin safe, \" said manley. After the accused bomber killed himself, interim austin police chief brian manley had time to think about the way every little detail was handled by his team. \"what we have to do, is we have to make ourselves better for it. We have to look at the lessons learned and we have to look at a way to make ourselves more resilient and stronger coming out of this, \" manley said. According to manley, he regrets referring to the bomber as a challenged young man and apologizes that someone on his team said publicly that the first bombing victim may have created and accidentally detonated the device that killed him. \"those were comments that, if you have to investigate something, fine, but that's just not something that you put out publicly, \" said manley.

        "summary": "The un human rights office has urged the white house to halt its zero-tolerance policy of separating parents from their children at the us-mexico border, reports newsweek. The practice has caused asylum-seekers and others in vulnerable situations to be \"subjected to criminal prosecution and having their children — including extremely young children — taken away from them as a result, \" a spokesperson said in a statement released tuesday. She said that several hundred children, including toddlers, had been separated from their families since october. In april, the new york times estimated that more than 700 children had been taken from parents or guardians in the prior six months, and nbc news estimates that there are currently 550 children in custody at the border. The us was quick to respond, with un ambassador nikki haley accusing the un of hypocrisy by focusing on migrant children while ignoring \"the reprehensible human rights records of several members of its own human rights council, \" she said. The zero-tolerance policy is an attempt to reduce the thousands of central americans, primarily from el salvador, guatemala, and honduras, who cross the us-mexico border each week asking for asylum from violence in their own countries, according to the guardian. President trump sought to distance himself from the policy in a tweet tuesday that blamed the problem on \"bad legislation passed by the democrats. \" \"border security laws should be changed but the dems can't get their act together! started the wall, \" he added. But there is no law requiring that parents be separated from their children, per politifact, and the policy was announced by the attorney general and implemented by the white house. The us is the only un member state that has not ratified the un convention on children's rights, but since it has ratified similar conventions, it has a legal obligation to every child in \" its care, \" the un spokesperson says, calling the separations \" arbitrary and unlawful. \"",

The new york post reports that the gunman arrived at a bushwick building around midnight and began shooting a semi-automatic weapon; police describe a scene littered with spent shells and note there was no indication of forced entry. Two people were murdered on one floor, and a third was killed in bed on a separate floor; a fourth was wounded. The shooter ultimately went to the building's roof and took his own life with a gunshot to the head, reports nbc new york. The nypd says the victims were the man's bandmates, and confirmed the shooter had been booted from the band; they could not verify that was the motive. The new york times digs up a few details on the unnamed men, who are thought to mostly be in their 20s and members of a band called the yellow dogs. The post's law enforcement sources described the men as iranians who had been here for some time and were hoping to be granted asylum.",

Results of a new survey published yesterday by the organization for economic co-operation and development ( oecd ) show that only one in 10 15-year-olds can solve complex financial problems, and one in six can't even make simple decisions about how to use and spend money. The us came in ninth among the 18 countries surveyed, beating out colombia, italy, and israel, but lost out to china, belgium, and estonia. The survey asked participants questions ranging from how much of a paycheck was actually going into a bank account through direct deposit to the more complicated task of selecting the better of two loan proposals. The report's authors say that there should be more standardized financial education in schools, but one financial expert disagrees. \" what do kids learn? they learn from what they see at home, \" he tells the wall street journal. His assertion may back up test scores of kids from china, the top performers in the survey.

More than one in six 15-year-olds is unable to make even simple decisions about everyday spending, and only one in 10 can solve complex financial tasks, according to the test. Among the seemingly simple questions that american teens struggled with was determining how much money was going into a bank account from a theoretical month's pay. The pay slip for the month of july listed four numbers: gross pay, deductions, net salary and gross salary year to date. Only 28.8 % could correctly say how much money was automatically deposited into the worker's bank account. By comparison, 74.8 % of students in shanghai got the right answer.

        "summary": "A 15-person team today begins a five-day, thousand-mile voyage from fiji to the pacific island of nikumaroro, where it ' ll be searching both land and sea for traces of amelia earhart. Wndu profiles a perhaps surprising member of the tighar team: a 40-year-old man from south bend, ind., who owns a trucking company. Rodney mcdonald tells the station he will be part of what tighar says is a four-person land team tasked with scouring the northwestern end of the island \" for signs of an initial survival camp \" and sweeping the area with metal detectors. Tighar notes that the existence of what it's calling camp zero \" is purely theoretical \" and has \" zero historical support beyond the logic that some kind of onshore campsite should have been desirable or even necessary. \" afp last week reported that tighar's 11th expedition will be staffed by tighar executive director ric gillespie, along with 14 volunteers, and as for why mcdonald is one of them, he tells wndu it's not because he's an earhart nut. In fact, the station describes his application as \" unconventional because he knows very little about earhart. \" but after turning 40, feeling \" ready for a new life experience \" and reading an article about the expedition, he decided to give it a go. He says he's most interested in whether survival would have been possible there. \" the other 14 people are all about... ' can we find the missing link? can we solve this mystery? ' i ' m going to be an objective set of eyes because my only goal in this is to figure out what it would be like to sustain life. \" well, and there's a second goal: he intends to write a book about the experience.

There is still no answer, but there are more details: a timeline of bland's final hours before she was found dead of an apparent hanging has been shared. Capt. Brian cantrell of the waller county sheriff's office says bland refused a breakfast tray at 6: 30am on the day in question, per the new york times. She told a jailer at 7am, \" i ' m fine \" and later asked about making a call from the phone in her cell. She was told she could using a pin number, but records show no call was made, per abc news. For the next 90 minutes, a motion-activated jailhouse camera, which doesn't actually show bland's cell, displays no movement in the hallway leading in that direction. Then, shortly after 9am, it catches the reaction of a female jailer who went to check on bland, nbc chicago reports. She called in medical personnel, who reportedly performed cpr. Cantrell says bland used a plastic bag liner from a trash bin in her cell as a noose; all trash bag liners, which had been oked by an inspector, have now been removed from cells. He adds she was kept in a cell alone because she was considered a \" high risk \" inmate due to the charge against her ( assaulting a public servant ). The waller county da says the investigation is \" being treated just as it would be a murder investigation \" and notes the case will likely be forwarded to a grand jury, perhaps next month. Video hard drives have been turned over to the fbi, who will search for any signs of manipulation.

            "Knoxville drivers greeted by banners warning that diversity is anti-white genocide by travis gettys tuesday, december 31, 2013 11: 21 edt police in knoxville have removed two vinyl banners bearing a white supremacist message from an interstate 640 overpass. Banners bearing the message \"'diversity ' is a code word for white genocide \" in red ink were reported monday morning by a 911 caller. Officers took down the banners, which were about 30 inches tall and 123 feet long, from a norfolk southern railroad bridge that spans the interstate. Police aren't sure who printed the banners or tied them to the overpass, but they've offered to return them if the owner calls to claim them. Banners or signs carrying similar messages have been displayed in recent months in arkansas and oregon, and flyers with the slogan were passed out at eastern kentucky university.

Sasai, who told the wall street journal in april he was \" overwhelmed with shame \" over the scandal, was found hanging from a stairway handrail at a research facility at the riken center for developmental biology in kobe where he'd served as deputy director. Though a riken spokesman won't speculate as to whether the scandal is to blame, colleagues tell the japan times sasai had been hospitalized and received counseling since the news broke, and a riken official says he seemed \" both physically and mentally exhausted \" recently. An internal investigation had cleared sasai of misconduct, but determined he was accountable for not catching haruko obokata's mistakes. Sasai, 52, left at least three letters behind, each addressed to obokata, riken officials, and colleagues, reports the ap; he also left two apparent suicide notes on his secretary's desk. Meanwhile, obokata is trying to replicate results of the renounced study under video surveillance, according to the washington post. Sasai had advised obokata and checked over her research papers — both retracted from nature in july after being published in january — which had supposedly shown that stem cells could be made by exposing regular cells to acid. In april, sasai wrote of his deep shame for failing as obokata's mentor. The president of riken says sasai was \" invaluable to the global scientific community, \" and a government spokesperson lauded him for contributing significant research in regenerative medicine.",

Boston university school of medicine researchers say data from the framingham heart study, which has tracked the health of thousands of people in the massachusetts town since 1948, reveals that \" since 1977, there has been a decline in the incidence of dementia of 20 % per decade, \" nbc news reports. Heart disease rates dropped alongside dementia rates, but only among people who had at least a high school education, according to the researchers, whose study is published in the new england journal of medicine. \" it's very good news, \" a national institute on aging epidemiologist tells usa today. \" we're seeing one generation after another where the risk is going down. \" the decline was steepest in cases of vascular dementia, which is caused by impaired supply of blood to the brain, though there was also a decline in alzheimer's cases. The research suggests that dementia will not be as huge a health care problem in coming decades as earlier believed, the new york times reports, though since people are living longer, the number of cases is still expected to go up — and rising rates of diabetes and obesity could send dementia rates back up again. Still, researchers say they hope the study will inspire people to improve heart health and keep their brains busy. \" people may say, ' i don't mind getting a heart attack. It's a good way to go, ' \" study co-author sudha seshadri says. \" but heart disease may not just damage your heart. It could cause dementia.

            "Six british soldiers have been arrested in new york after an off-duty police officer was allegedly beaten up and robbed outside a bar. A court in manhattan heard that the royal regiment of scotland soldiers allegedly punched an nypd officer to the floor and continued hitting him as a friend attempted to stop them. According to reports three of the four soldiers, who are from fiji but are based in edinburgh, lashed out in the early hours of friday morning when the officer started talking to a woman who was with the group. The ministry of defence has said it is aware of british soldiers being involved in an incident and added that any soldier found to be in the wrong could face discharge. Reports claim that at some point during the brawl the police officer is said to have pulled out a knife on his alleged attackers. One of the soldiers is accused of grabbing the policeman's mobile phone and a chain around his neck when he attempted to call 911, the times reported. The soldiers have claimed that they lashed out when the nypd officer called one of them a \"black b****** \". The court was told that when he identified himself as a police officer they responded saying: \"we don't care. F*** the police \". The soldiers - iosefo yavala, iliakini raderua, thomas shute, felite vunisarati,"

        "summary": "For more than two months, a 13-year-old in india took part in an extreme religious fast, reports the bbc. Early this month she called off that fast, but she fell into a coma two days later and died of cardiac arrest on oct. 4 — and now her parents, well-off jewelers in hyderabad, and other family members have been charged with homicide, cops tell afp. Aradhana samdariya's relatives insist she chose to embark on the 68-day fast of her own volition as part of a ritual in jainism, an ancient indian religion that believes \" the way to liberation and bliss is to live lives of harmlessness and renunciation \" and whose foundation lies in the \" concern for the welfare of every being in the universe. \" but others, including the children's rights group that filed the complaint against aradhana's family, say the young teen was coerced, perhaps in the misguided belief it would make her father's business more profitable. Aradhana's grandfather notes it's not the first time the girl had fasted: he says she had pulled off an eight-day fast and a 34-day fast, and so was determined to go even longer this time, partly because she was interested in becoming a nun, per the deccan chronicle. But a local ngo says the dad's business was faltering and the family's guru suggested having aradhana fast for good luck. The bbc and afp note she lived on nothing but boiled water during her fast, while others, such as firstpost.com, say not even sips of water are permitted during the most extreme version of jain fasting. Psychologists say that children are especially vulnerable to the guilt that may lure them into such dangerous practices. \" the child is made to believe it is for the good of the family, \" one expert says. \" what is sacrificed is the health of the minor. \" ( fasting helped lead to disaster at an arizona sweat lodge. )",

He said his assailant ran off immediately after the attack.

Police became suspicious of witt's story when they couldn't find any witnesses who could corroborate it, the guardian reports. They also saw surveillance footage of witt purchasing the knife. He ultimately admitted to police he cut himself accidentally, police say.

Canadian law professor richard mclaren was picked by the world anti-doping agency in may to head a probe after the former head of moscow's anti-doping lab told the new york times he gave russian athletes steroids, then helped swap out \" dirty \" urine samples for clean ones, the globe and mail reports — all under the direction of russia's ministry of sport, which oversaw the elaborate switcheroo, mclaren announced monday in toronto. \" the surprise result … was the revelation of the extent of state oversight and directed control of the moscow laboratory in processing, and covering up urine samples of russian athletes from virtually all sports before and after the sochi games, \" mclaren writes in the report, adding he's \" unwaveringly confident \" in its findings, per the new york times. The process that mclaren calls the \" disappearing positive methodology \" produced more than 300 false results and didn't just affect the sochi olympics: the report noted these results spanned from 2011 all the way through last year's world swimming championships and included other events such as 2013's world track championships held in moscow. Ex-lab director grigory rodchenkov, who the bbc notes is now in hiding in the us, says the country took advantage of its hosting privileges to pull off the scheme and that the russian secret service even helped out. Russia's track and field athletes are already prohibited from competing as part of the russian team ( they can compete as \" neutrals \" if they're found to be clean ) in the rio competition, which kicks off aug. 5, but these latest revelations could make things a lot worse: a russian news site notes mclaren's report could herald \" the most difficult week in the history of russian sport, \" per the bbc.",

Researchers from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology say this chimp behavior has never before been documented and that it may shed some light on the species ' cultural customs — and even those of early humans. The scientists involved in the study published in scientific reports note that with camera traps, they found four chimp populations that \" habitually bang and throw rocks against trees, or toss them into tree cavities, \" amassing the rocks in \" conspicuous \" piles. The chimps are seen on camera picking up stones, then lobbing them at the trees while letting out a \" long-distance pant hoot vocalization. \" it's been mostly males observed engaging in this behavior ( and only in west africa ), though there have been some females and juvenile chimps that have also taken part. And while chimps are known to use various tools for foraging — a press release notes they ' ll wield sticks to get bugs or honey, or stone or wooden hammers to smash open nuts — that doesn't seem to be the case here. \" as the stone accumulation behavior does not seem to be linked to either the abundance of stones or the availability of suitable trees in an area, it is likely that it has some cultural elements, \" study co-author christophe boesch says. Another co-author, laura kehoe, lists some possibilities for the conversation: the loud behavior could be a ( mostly ) male display of some sort, or the rocks could be used as a \" signpost \" to mark paths or territories. Or, kehoe notes, they may be part of a \" sacred \" ritual. \" indigenous west african people have stone collections at'sacred'trees and such man-made stone collections are commonly observed across the world and look eerily similar to what we have discovered here, \" she writes.

Researchers of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig, germany, have thus initiated the 'pan african programme: the cultured chimpanzee ' and, since 2010, have collected data on chimpanzee behavior, demography and resource availability across africa following a standardized protocol.

An iranian court has ruled that a man who poured acid on a girl's face will have his eyes gouged out, says the report in shraq, as noted by the opposition group national council of resistance of iran. The ruling also orders that the criminal's nose and right ear be cut off as punishment for blinding and disfiguring his victim. The ncri calls the punishment \" inhuman \" and says it is another example of human rights abuses going unchecked in the country, even under new president hasan rouhani.

        "summary": "The cia is bracing for the release today of the long-awaited senate intelligence committee report on its use of torture — which one lawmaker on sunday warned could bring \" violence and deaths \" overseas. Here's what you need to know: who authored the report? democrats on the senate intelligence committee; republicans opted not to participate. Though it was compiled between 2009 and 2013 and runs 6,000 pages, just the executive summary — at roughly 10 % the length of the report — will be released. How detailed is it? the new york times describes it as \" by far the most thorough study of the program to date, \" and the result of a $ 40 million review of more than 6 million cia cables, memos, and other records. It boasts 35,000 footnotes, reports the washington post. What's omitted from the executive summary: the identities of some cia workers and the locations and host countries of secret prisons abroad will be redacted. The daily beast reports that about 15 staffers ran the cia program, and that some fear their names could potentially be determined using contextual details. An unnamed intelligence official says the agency has offered to assess potential exposure of those who factor into the report, along with any security concerns potential exposure could bring. The cia is not, however, providing security. Is what's left all new news? nope. As the times notes, we have leaks and freedom of information act requests, among other avenues, to thank for some details that have surfaced over the years about the cia's interrogation program. For instance, we know about this polish \" black site \" prison. So what will we learn? the guardian reports that the summary details the cases of 20 post-9/11 detainees who were tortured. Reuters talked to sources yesterday who say the details get fairly graphic: one detainee was reportedly threatened in a sexual manner with a broomstick; another detainee was intimidated with a power drill ( neither instrument was used ). How does the cia feel about its conclusions? earlier this year, director john brennan said the agency agrees with some findings but disputes others. The executive summary that the cia approved for the public in august was slammed by senate intelligence committee chair dianne feinstein as overly blacked out; what's emerging today is a compromise. We ' ll learn more about what the cia thinks: the executive summary will be joined by a cia rebuttal and a republican minority report, nbc news reports. What does dick cheney think? he's the latest bush administration official to defend the cia program. \" what i keep hearing out there is",

Next, in what the telegraph describes as a \" bloodbath, \" worries about china's economy caused markets to plunge across asia and in europe, where more than $ 250 billion was wiped off the value of major companies in early trading. Oil prices also plunged, along with currencies such as russia's ruble, which is now at an all-time low against the dollar, according to the telegraph. A market analyst at ig tells the bbc that \" more uncertainty \" is all he can predict. \" it does appear that we're moving very quickly to the downside, \" he says. Other analysts warn that panic may deepen as worries about the health of the chinese economy — and beijing's ability to turn it around — continue to grow. \" things are starting [ to ] look like the asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.

Today, african-american residents can be found in 199 out of every 200 neighborhoods nationwide. The remaining neighborhoods are mostly in remote rural areas or in cities with very little black population. \" but the report, which focuses on changes in housing over that period, reveals that integration hasn't been a \" magic bullet \" capable of killing all racial inequality, reports the los angeles times. \" far too many americans still lack the opportunity to achieve meaningful success, \" write the authors, who note that the annual median income of black households fell 3.2 % in 2010, to $ 32,068; 27.4 % of those households were below the poverty line. \" only a few decades ago, conventional wisdom held that segregation was the driving force behind socioeconomic inequality, \" they write. \" the persistence of inequality, even as segregation has receded, suggests that inequality is a far more complex phenomenon. \"",

During a preliminary trial wednesday, maui judge blaine kobayashi threw out the second-degree murder charge against alexandria duval, 37, citing a lack of evidence, reports nbc news. Duval's lawyer, todd eddins, says the evidence prosecutors presented — including vehicle records showing duval's ford explorer accelerated and steered off the cliff without braking while both sisters were inside, as well as witness statements noting the pair were fighting — could have supported \" many alternative conclusions, \" including \" that the passenger grabbed the wheel and caused the fatal crash, \" per khon. Duval was critically injured in the may 29 crash, while her twin sister, anastasia duval, was pronounced dead at the scene. The judge \" said there wasn't enough evidence to show that it wasn't an accident and that we didn't show any evidence that she knew there was a cliff on that side of the road, \" a prosecutor adds. \" it's very disappointing. \" prosecutors can still seek an indictment from a grand jury, though it isn't clear if they ' ll do so. Duval initially remained in custody over charges of disorderly conduct stemming from an arrest on christmas eve; her sister was also arrested at the same time. However, eddins says duval posted $ 4,000 bail wednesday evening and now hopes to be in upstate new york in time to attend her sister's funeral, reports maui now and the ap.

        "summary": "People may think they sigh just for the heck of it, but ucla and stanford researchers have pinpointed two specific clusters of neurons in the brain stem that appear to turn normal breaths into sighs — and that process may happen for a vital reason, a press release notes. Using mice for a study published online in nature, the researchers found one set of about 200 neurons that release two different neuropeptides that help brain cells talk to each other ( and those same peptides are especially active in the part of the human brain that influences breathing ). Another set of 200 neurons excited by the peptides made the animals ' breathing rate jump from 40 sighs an hour to 400 sighs an hour. If one peptide set was blocked, the mice sighed only half as much; both sets blocked meant sighing ceased. ( popular science notes the animals'regular breathing remained unchanged. ) not good, as scientists say sighing is a \" life-sustaining reflex. \" increased oxygen brought in by sighing is needed to reinflate the lungs ' alveoli sacs, which occasionally collapse. \" the only way to pop [ the alveoli ] open again is to sigh, which brings in twice the volume of a normal breath, \" study co-author jack feldman says in the release. \" if you don't sigh, your lungs will fail over time. \" this is probably why humans sigh about 12 times an hour, animals even more, popular science notes. But researchers still aren't sure how the emotional component of sighing — nature points out that people tend to sigh when they're sad, relieved, or tired — plays into the process, the guardian reports. \" it may be that neurons in the brain areas that process emotion are triggering the release of the sigh neuropeptides, but we don't know that, \" feldman says. Being able to control the sigh rate in the future could potentially allow scientists to help people with certain disorders: for example, those with anxiety disorders who sigh a lot may benefit from decreased sigh rates, while people with breathing issues may get relief from more sighing, npr notes.

Now there's strong evidence from studies in rats that the neural wiring resides in a particular part of the brain stem that regulates breathing, feldman and a team of researchers report in this week's issue of the journal nature. \" we identified a very compact circuit consisting of about 400 neurons, \" feldman says. A few years ago, feldman's lab showed that a substance called bombesin could increase sighing in rodents. \" rats normally sigh about 40 times an hour, \" feldman says. After bombesin was injected into the brain area that controls breathing rhythm, he says, \" the sigh rate went to 400 times an hour, while the basic breathing pattern didn't change. \" but it still wasn't clear precisely",
            "Researchers now have a better understanding of how the brain triggers sighing, which is vital to lung function. \"you must remember this: a kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh. \" contrary to the words immortalized by the piano singer in \"casablanca, \" a sigh is far more than a sigh. Heaving an unconscious sigh is a life-sustaining reflex that helps preserve lung function. Now a new study by researchers at ucla and stanford has pinpointed two tiny clusters of neurons in the brain stem that are responsible for transforming normal breaths into sighs. Published in the feb. 8 advance online edition of nature, the discovery may one day allow physicians to treat patients who cannot breathe deeply on their own — or who suffer from disorders in which frequent sighing becomes debilitating. \"sighing appears to be regulated by the fewest number of neurons we have seen linked to a fundamental human behavior, \" explained jack feldman, a professor of neurobiology at the david geffen school of medicine at ucla and a member of the ucla brain research institute. \"one of the holy grails in neuroscience is figuring out how the brain controls behavior.

The strawberry moon, a full moon in june so named by native americans to mark the beginning of strawberry season, hasn't appeared on the same date as the summer solstice for several decades: earthsky says 1967 was the last such moon, while the old farmer's almanac puts that previous date as falling nearly 70 years ago.

Griffin — whose twin brother shaquill also played for ucf and is now a cornerback for the seattle seahawks — was born with a congenital birth defect that affected his ability to use his left hand and had the extremity amputated when he was a child because of extreme pain. Following his pick, which took place in the fifth round, the 22-year-old from st. Petersburg, florida, told espn that he was speechless from the news. Eric gay/ap/rex/shutterstock \"i couldn't breathe, \" he said. \"i didn't know what to say. I was trying to get the words out, but i couldn't talk. \" griffin had previously told multiple outlets that he expected to be picked up by a team during this year's draft. But despite making history, the athlete told today he would rather others not concentrate on his disability. \"one day i ' m going to be called 'shaquem griffin the football player ' and not 'shaquem griffin the one-hand wonder, ' \" he told the outlet. \"i don't need that name.

        "summary": "Us forces in afghanistan dropped the military's biggest non-nuclear bomb on an islamic state target in afghanistan, reports the ap. Pentagon spokesman adam stump says it was the first-ever combat use of the bomb, formally called the gbu-43/massive ordnance air blast bomb. Based on the acronym, it has been nicknamed the \" mother of all bombs, \" with the equivalent of 11 tons of tnt. Stump says it was dropped on a cave complex used by isis fighters in the achin district of nangarhar province, close to the border with pakistan. The bomb weighs 21,000 pounds and was first detonated in a 2003 test, reports fox news. When dropped, it detonates before reaching the ground, resulting in a huge blast radius. See a history channel video about the bomb and the 2003 test here. It is not the nation's biggest conventional weapon, notes the guardian. That would be the massive ordnance penetrator gbu-57, a \" bunker buster. \" back in 2007, the guardian reported that russia had detonated the \" father of all bombs, \" said to be four times more powerful than the us weapon. The test took place at a military base. It's a \" thermobaric bomb \" with a yield of 44 tons of tnt, adds business insider. Gen. Joseph votel, commander of us central command, gave the green light for use of the bomb in afghanistan, reports cnn. White house spokesman sean spicer did not answer questions about whether president trump personally approved the mission. \" i ' m not going to get into the details right now, \" he said, deferring to the pentagon. Npr hits some of the logistics: \" at more than 30 feet long, it's too big to fit inside the weapons bay of a standard air force bomber. Instead, troops load it into the cargo compartment of a specialized transport, the mc-130 combat talon, which releases it over the target by opening its ramp in the same way it might for paratroopers or air-dropped supplies. \"",
