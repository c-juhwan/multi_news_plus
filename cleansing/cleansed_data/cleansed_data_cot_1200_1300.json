David puckett — 4 feet tall with light brown hair and blue-green eyes — left his aurora home around 5: 30pm saturday wearing only a light jacket, per the ap. Police say david wandered away from school once before and foul play isn't suspected, but an amber alert was issued monday to allow officers to share details of the case as impending cold weather is a concern. Search dogs, a helicopter, 100 officers, and 50 fbi agents have been searching within a 2.5-mile radius of the family home, reports the denver post. A $ 10,000 reward has been offered for david's safe return, reports kktv.",

As cbs denver explains it, the two officers are best friends and the couples have vacationed together...

Jamie says the swinging ended four years ago, but kusa calls the get-together a \" swingers party. \" after some sort of disagreement ensued, possibly involving who would participate in swinging, the sloans asked the ownbeys to leave — and all hell broke loose. Jamie allegedly punched stephanie; then steven allegedly hit jamie; then jeremy allegedly started brawling with steven. Then steven pulled a gun; he admitted as much to the aurora cops who arrived at the scene, but insisted he didn't point it at anyone, though jeremy says it was pointed at him. Sloan and ownbey have both been put on desk duty while the incident is investigated — and, yes, that will include an investigation of those swinging allegations. \" we have to dig deeper.

Forbes reports researchers found children from religious backgrounds are actually less altruistic than children from secular households. Researchers tested more than 1,100 christian, muslim, and nonreligious children between the ages of 5 and 12 from around the world. They gave the kids stickers and had them choose how many to share with another anonymous child. It turns out secular children shared more of their stickers. \" our findings support the notion that the secularization of moral discourse does not reduce human kindness, \" lead researcher jean decety tells science. \" in fact it does just the opposite. \" but the relationship between religion and altruism in children was even more pronounced than that. Science reports the more religious a child's household — based on interviews with parents — the less generous the child. And while all kids shared fewer stickers as they got older, the difference was even more pronounced in kids from religious households, according to forbes. Decety says the differences may be because of something called \" moral licensing, \" in which an individual — unconsciously or not — feels like they can behave badly because they see themselves as a morally right person, science reports. \" these results reveal … how religion negatively influences children's altruism, challenging the view that religiosity facilitates prosocial behavior, \" researchers conclude in the study.",

In the video, the officer can be seen still pointing his weapon into the vehicle. \" i told him not to reach for it, \" the officer says. \" i told him to get his hand off it. \" relatives say castile, 32, died within minutes of being taken to hennepin county medical center on wednesday night. \" please don't tell me my boyfriend's gone, \" reynolds pleads in the video, in which she is ordered from the vehicle and ends up in a squad car with her 4-year-old daughter. \" he don't deserve this, please. He works for st. Paul public schools. He's never been in jail, anything. He's not a gang member, anything. \" at the hospital, grieving family members described castile, a cafeteria supervisor at jj hill montessori school in st. Paul, as a \" hard-working man \" and an \" upstanding citizen \" who was \" very nonconfrontational, \" the star tribune reports. He was \" a black individual driving in falcon heights who was immediately criminally profiled and he lost his life over it tonight, \" cousin antonio johnson says.

Wkrg reports a pastor in alabama received a voicemail tuesday from a man claiming to be a washington post reporter looking for women \" willing to make damaging remarks \" about moore. The man — who used a private number and what appears to be an exaggerated accent, per the week — said he would \" not be fully investigating these claims \" but would pay between $ 5,000 and $ 7,000. He gave his name as \" bernie bernstein \" and \" al bernstein, \" but no one by either name works at the post, an outlet moore has vowed to sue. An email address provided also appears not to exist. A rep for moore's campaign says he doesn't know who made the call, which mashable calls an example of \" blatant anti-semitism. \" the post's executive editor, meanwhile, says the paper is in no way involved and \" shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism. \" last week, the post reported that 70-year-old moore had a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32. Four other women have since made accusations against moore, leading the republican national committee to withdraw its support in the alabama senate race.

According to fox news, the emailer was concerned another chinese student attending the verona academy of fine arts in italy was going to commit suicide.

            "Baghdad/washington u.s. Air strikes destroyed an islamic state convoy near the iraqi city of mosul but u.s. Officials said on saturday it was unclear whether the group's top commander abu bakr al-baghdadi had been in any of the 10 targeted vehicles. Colonel patrick ryder, a central command spokesman, said the u.s. Military had reason to believe that the convoy was carrying leaders of islamic state, an al qaeda offshoot which controls large chunks of iraq and syria. The convoy consisted of 10 islamic state armed trucks. \" i can confirm that coalition aircraft did conduct a series of air strikes yesterday evening in iraq against what was assessed to be a gathering of isil leaders near mosul, \" said ryder, using another name for islamic state. \" we cannot confirm if isil leader abu bakr al-baghdadi was among those present. \" islamic state had been changing its strategy since the air strikes began, switching to lower profile vehicles to avoid being targeted, according to residents of towns the group holds. A mosul morgue official said 50 bodies of islamic state militants were brought to the facility after the air strike. Mosul, northern iraq's biggest city, was overrun on june 10 in an offensive that saw vast parts of iraq's sunni regions fall to the islamic state and allied groups.

        "summary": "That person reading a book on the treadmill may be on to something. A university of florida study published last month in plos one showed that older people may be able to exercise more intensely — and gain the benefits associated with that — by doing two things at once. The scientists examined 20 healthy people with an average age of 73, and 28 people with parkinson's disease who were 7 years younger on average, per livescience. The participants completed a dozen cognitive tasks while sitting in a room and while pedaling a stationary bike. They healthy participants sped up their pedaling an average of 25 % ( some hit 50 % ) when they were completing the simplest tasks, like saying \" pa \" as many times as they could in 10 seconds, or saying the word \" go \" when a blue star flashed on a projection screen. ( never mind that the word \" go \" might prod one to do anything faster... ) when the tasks became more difficult, the participants slowed — but in healthy adults, their speeds were, on average, never less than 2.6 % faster than their baseline speed. The researchers propose that cognitive tasks release the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline, which can make the brain's frontal lobes speedier and more efficient; in turn, motor and cognitive performance improve. Those with parkinson's disease pedaled slower than the healthy adults ( but still faster, on average, than their baseline speed while completing 9 of the tasks ), which researchers believe is due to deficits in their neurotransmitters. Researcher lori altmann was surprised by the findings: \" every dual-task study that i ' m aware of shows when people are doing two things at once they get worse, \" she says in a press release.

Researchers studying data from two us states found that the average age of a person suffering their first stroke fell from 71 to 69 between 1993 and 2005, and people under the age of 55 now make up nearly a fifth of stroke victims, webmd reports. The researchers believe the trend has been caused by a rise in diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol levels. Factors like improved diagnosis may also be contributing, the lead researcher says, but \" the rising trend found in our study is of great concern for public health because strokes in younger people translate to greater lifetime disability. \" experts say the study highlights the need for younger people to be aware of stroke symptoms. \" this is a very disturbing trend and meaningful, strong data, \" a neurologist tells usa today. \" in older people, we're more likely to make the call ( of stroke ).

This week, the tabloid has still featured photos of scantily clad women there ( rosie huntington-whiteley in lingerie yesterday; two actresses in bikinis today ), but their breasts are covered up. Activists had been railing against the \" page 3 girls \" feature in recent years, calling it sexist, afp reports. According to the times, murdoch himself called the tradition \" old-fashioned \" last year and a change has been in the works ever since. Even so, it was just after murdoch bought the sun that the tradition began, back in 1970 with german model stephanie rahn. Since then, models like samantha fox and katie price have seen their careers launched by the page. But the sun's pr head insists to afp that there's no official confirmation from the tabloid that the tradition is definitively over, and afp also notes that in today's edition, readers were informed they could see topless photos online instead ( the guardian notes that viewers are being directed to page3.com ). Lucy-anne holmes, the actress who started the no more page 3 campaign in 2012, wasn't exactly effusive in her praise of the move: \" the sun hasn't suddenly decided that women say, think, and do interesting and incredible things, \" she tells the bbc. \" it's still basically saying women are here for decoration, but it's a step in the right direction. \"",

Obamacare hasn't driven down the costs of health insurance, or found a magical new source to cover those costs. \" similar move: eater notes that a popular los angeles restaurant, republique, asks diners to pay a 3 % surcharge for employee health care costs. The restaurant makes it optional, however, and says it is not specifically tied to the new law's mandates.",

Aimbetov — who got his seat when british singer sarah brightman canceled her $ 52 million space voyage, citing family reasons — will return with mogensen on sept. 12 along with current iss commander gennady padalka, a russian. Volkov will remain on the iss, where american scott kelly will be the new commander. ( mogensen is his country's first astronaut, but a lego man got to space years before him. )",

        "summary": "Both starbucks and amazon are in the news for recent changes — and not necessarily good ones: starbucks is changing its rewards program in a fashion that hurts people who don't spend much per visit. Right now, loyalty program members earn a free food item or beverage after earning 12 stars, and one star is earned per transaction ( so you can buy a $ 2 coffee each time and only spend about $ 24 to earn a freebie ), the ap reports. But come april, members will need 125 stars to earn a free item and will earn two stars for every dollar spent ( which means, no matter what, members will have to spend $ 62.50 to get a freebie ). Cnnmoney and the new york daily news are rounding up reactions from unhappy customers: \" @starbucks crowing ' you ' ll earn stars faster! ' \" reads one tweet, \" but you ' ll need more than 10x the stars to get a freebie. That's inflation, not incentive. \" read starbucks'take on the change here. Meanwhile, anyone not a member of amazon prime will now have to spend $ 49 in order to get free shipping on amazon, the ap reports. Previously, the threshold for free shipping was $ 35 for non-prime members. As mashable notes, however, you can still get free shipping on certain items if you order at least $ 25 worth of eligible books, which must be fulfilled and shipped by amazon; in that case, other products sold by amazon and select third-party sellers would also ship free. The outrage doesn't seem to be as intense for this move, though time notes that redditors complained, which is how the quiet change got noticed. And jason del rey notes on re/code, \" amazon's shipping costs spiked last year as the company pushed faster delivery times for its prime membership customers.

But as \" clever \" as wired reports this trick to be — the headphone cord is used as an antenna — it has several limitations, including that headphones with a microphone must be plugged into the jack; the hacker must be within 16 feet of the phone; and google now or siri must be enabled. \" additional functionality, especially concerning user convenience, has often come at the cost of some security, \" gavin reid, vp of threat intelligence for lancope, tells forbes. \" in this case the hack needs proximity to work and is a proof of concept needing specialized hardware. \" and while it's possible for people with this hardware to position themselves in crowded places such as airports and trigger some kind of attack on any qualifying phones within range, he adds that the odds are low. \" this attack is less likely to be leveraged by the criminal underground, especially with other methods much easier to implement. \" even so, vincent strubel at anssi says, \" the sky is the limit here.

        "summary": "A dark cloud is hovering over apple's collective head: analysts expect today's earnings report, to be released after the closing bell, to show the company's first drop in profits since 2003. Their estimates, as reported by bloomberg and the los angeles times, peg the fiscal q1 net income sinking about 2 % to between $ 13.41 and $ 13.48 a share. And consider this: with the exception of a single quarter since 2003, apple's profit has jumped more than 10 %. What you need to know before the report, which tim cook and apple's cfo will follow with a conference call that one barclays analyst has dubbed \" the most important... In years \": as chris o ' brien explains for the times, apple is expected to report record iphone sales and record revenue ( somewhere around $ 54.7 billion — about an 18 % bump, which happens to be the slowest growth rate since 2009 ). But \" no matter how mind-blowing its performance, \" investors are spooked, and fear apple may soon be dethroned as the smartphone king. Among their worries: narrowing profit margins in the face of an expanded product line, a rising samsung, and a saturated us market in which many of the smartphone-less are looking for a device cheaper than the $ 199-and-up iphone 5. The big opportunity could come in places like china — except there's generally no mobile-phone-carrier subsidy in emerging markets, which means the cheapest iphone typically has a $ 450 price tag. And that's led to apple being outsold in china by four chinese smartphone makers who hawk cheaper devices. One, china wireless technologies, is just 1 % of apple's size, reports bloomberg. But apple could still surprise today: a bloomberg review of past reports found that the company has bested analysts ' estimates in every quarter but three since 2006.",

Diplomatic post in benghazi, libya, in which four americans were killed, including the ambassador, is a case study of how an administration can carefully keep the focus as long as possible on one storyline — and then turn on a dime when it is no longer tenable. For political reasons, it certainly was in the white house's interests to not portray the attack as a terrorist incident, especially one that took place on the anniversary of the sept. 11 attacks.

Contrary to the official story that he merely suffered scratches and/or a slight head wound in the explosion on friday, latest reports say he has second-degree burns to his face and chest, plus a piece of shrapnel lodged near his heart which is affecting his breathing – though saleh, who is 69, is said to have been able to walk from the plane when he landed in riyadh. A second plane followed him, reportedly carrying 24 members of his family. This is one indication that to all intents and purposes the saleh era is finished. He is unlikely ever to return to yemen as president – and the saudis and americans will be working behind the scenes to ensure that he doesn't. It's also worth mentioning that others injured by the explosion include the prime minister, deputy prime minister, the heads of both houses of parliament and the governor of sana ' a, the capital. Some of them have also been flown to saudi arabia for treatment. One of saleh's nephews, the commander of the special forces, is said to have been killed.

            "Ali abdullah saleh is in riyadh for treatment amid speculation over his rule, two days after he was injured in attack. Protesters have been calling for the ouster of president saleh since february [ reuters ] yemen's president ali abdullah saleh is in riyadh for medical treatment, after he was injured in an attack on his compound on friday, the saudi royal court said in a statement. \" the yemeni president has arrived along with officials and citizens who had received different injuries for treatment in saudi arabia, \" the royal court said on sunday. Friday's rocket attack on saleh's presidential palace in the capital sanaa marked a major escalation in the four-month-long uprising against his 33-year rule. Pro-democracy protesters in yemen celebrated on sunday following news of the president's departure. \" today, yemen is newborn, \" sang dozens of youths in sanaa's university square, dubbed \" change square \", which has been the epicentre of anti-government protests that have raged since february. \" this is it, the regime has fallen, \" others chanted. Yemen live blog al jazeera has learned that saleh arrived at king khalid air base in riyadh and was transferred to a military hospital. The embattled leader suffered \" burns and scratches to the face and chest, \" an official said, after the ruling general people",
            "With the departure of president ali abdullah saleh for medical treatment in saudi arabia, yemenis now have a chance to resolve the political crisis that has bedevilled the country since february. Contrary to the official story that he merely suffered scratches and/or a slight head wound in the explosion on friday, latest reports say he has second-degree burns to his face and chest, plus a piece of shrapnel lodged near his heart which is affecting his breathing – though saleh, who is 69, is said to have been able to walk from the plane when he landed in riyadh. A second plane followed him, reportedly carrying 24 members of his family. This is one indication that to all intents and purposes the saleh era is finished. He is unlikely ever to return to yemen as president – and the saudis and americans will be working behind the scenes to ensure that he doesn't. It's also worth mentioning that others injured by the explosion include the prime minister, deputy prime minister, the heads of both houses of parliament and the governor of sana ' a, the capital. Some of them have also been flown to saudi arabia for treatment. One of saleh's nephews, the commander of the special forces, is said to have been killed. So, even discounting saleh himself, what's left"

His lawyer tells abc the letter sheds light on the \" really atrocious conditions \" the soldier was held in, which he says military decision-makers should take into account. Bergdahl says that after two early escape attempts, he spent three months chained to a bed and blindfolded. He was allowed to sit chained to the bed only after his muscles atrophied, he says, and after a year, he was moved to a cage, where he spent the remainder of his captivity. Bergdahl says that despite his physical decline, he made around a dozen escape attempts, escaping once for nine days, but \" without food and only putrid water to drink, my body failed on top of a short mountain close to evening \" and he was recaptured and severely beaten. He says throughout his captivity, he was frequently beaten and sometimes told he would be executed, or \" told i would leave the next day, and the next day told i would be there for 30 years. \" the lawyer says that considering bergdahl's savage treatment and his behavior as a prisoner, it would be \" unduly harsh to impose on him the lifetime stigma of a court-martial conviction or an other than honorable discharge and to deny him veterans benefits, \" cnn reports.",

It seems to have gone over well, considering it has a 98 % rating from critics, and a 94 % rating from audiences, on rotten tomatoes. Four opinions on the film, not to be confused with the live-action spider-man movie series: chris klimek calls it a \" graphically dazzling, generously imaginative, nakedly optimistic, mercilessly funny and inclusive-without-being-all-pious-about-it animated odyssey \" at npr. \" the animators have achieved an almost hypnotic effect \" with \" a stylized, kinetic visual language unlike any animated or live-action film that came before, \" he notes, also complimenting voice actors mahershala ali and lily tomlin. \" i thought black panther would be the superhero movie that best embodied contemporary concerns about representation in the genre that dominates blockbusters these days. I was wrong, \" joe gross writes at the austin american-statesman, calling spider-verse \" the canniest, hippest and simply the best comic book movie made to date. \" visually dazzling, it \" recalls the work of comics artists \" while \" superhero tropes are explored, exploited or exploded from moment to gorgeously kinetic moment. \" though peter parker makes an appearance, \" hilariously voiced by jake johnson, \" it's multiracial miles morales ( shameik moore ) who teaches us that anyone can be spider-man, peter travers writes at rolling stone.

His plea came hours after a federal grand jury indicted him on six counts, including conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws. \" there's no question that i've done wrong, \" edwards told reporters outside federal court in winston-salem, north carolina. \" but i did not break the law and i never, ever thought i was breaking the law. \" he was released on his own recognizance, but was ordered to surrender his passport and remain within the lower 48 states.

The finding came after an inquiry into the high-profile death of former kgb officer alexander litvinenko, who was fatally poisoned in 2006. Judge robert owen said he's certain that two russian agents laced litvinenko's green tea with polonium-210 inside a london hotel — and that the mission \" was probably approved \" by putin himself and the head of russia's fsb spy agency ( the successor to the kgb ), reports the new york times. Litvinenko accused putin from his deathbed, but this appears to be the first time an official inquiry has linked the russian president to the slaying, notes the ap. Russia, not surprisingly, isn't buying it. \" we regret that a purely criminal case has been politicized and has darkened the general atmosphere of bilateral relations, \" says a rep for the russian foreign ministry. Britain launched the inquiry at the urging of litvinenko's widow, who welcomed the findings and called on the uk to issue sanctions on russia and place a travel ban on putin, reports the bbc. That seems unlikely, though britain says it will now freeze the assets of andrei lugovoi and dmitry kovtun, the two men accused by british police of the killing. Moscow refuses to extradite them. The judge cited a number of possible motives, including russia's belief that litvinenko betrayed moscow by working with british intelligence. He also cited the \" highly personal attacks \" by litvinenko on putin before the agent's death, including litvinenko's clam that putin was a pedophile, reports the independent. \" it hardly needs saying that the allegations made by mr litvinenko against president putin in this article were of the most serious nature, \" wrote the judge. \" could they have had any connection with his death? \" read his full report here.",

The idea, which is \" spurring intrigue and concern in the life sciences community, \" as the new york times reports, could enable scientists to essentially create human beings in the lab without biological parents. On tuesday, about 150 scientists met at harvard to talk about the project, the washington post reports. Attendees were told not to discuss the matter with the media or on social media, adding an air of secrecy to a concept that already raises plenty of ethical questions. \" just because something becomes possible, how should we approach determining if it is ethical to pursue? \" stanford bioengineering professor drew endy wrote in an essay published thursday. But harvard researcher george church, who helped organize the conference, says its intent, and its ostensible secrecy, are being misrepresented. The original plan was to live-stream the event, along with inviting numerous journalists, he tells the post. But a companion article written by several scientists has yet to be published, so they decided to keep the conference private, lest they be accused of \" science by press release. \" ethical considerations have been discussed since the project's inception, he tells the times. The goal, he adds, is not to create people, and would not be limited to the human genome. Instead, the improved ability to synthesize dna ( which is now possible, but expensive and difficult ) in general could be applied to animals, plants, and microbes. In any event, the post writes, \" something tells us this isn't the last time we're going to be talking about synthetic humanoids. \"",

        "summary": "Following a meeting on president obama's health plan fix yesterday, insurers said they'd work to maintain health exchanges and avoid cancellations — but they were frustrated. Though the president of the industry trade organization cited a \" very productive \" meeting, plenty of execs were annoyed that obama hadn't talked to them about the new plan before he announced it, the new york times reports. \" we went forward with the intent that this was the law of the land, \" an insurance vp tells usa today. \" nobody was focused on the existing plans. \" executives also related to obama their concern that the plan could drive consumer costs up. That's because younger and healthier people — key to keeping premiums down — may now stick with cheaper plans rather than entering the exchanges. Another issue: some states intend to ignore the fix, leaving thousands of health plans at risk, the times notes. Washington, vermont, and rhode island are among those saying they won't allow extensions of plans not adhering to obamacare standards, according to the times and washington post. Florida, kentucky, north carolina, ohio, and texas will allow renewals, the post notes, while other states are still deciding ( the post is keeping track ). For one thing, it's not clear whether states can \" act based on executive order, \" louisiana's insurance commissioner says.",

Result? for 94 % of participants, their symptoms disappeared, reports the guardian. For those with other types of blood cancers, the response rate was a lesser but still a remarkable 80 % or more. And that's why words such as \" extraordinary, \" \" unprecedented, \" and \" revolution \" are being used in coverage of the presentation at the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement for science. In the study, researchers at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle removed t-cells from patients, armed them with molecules that go after cancer, and reintroduced them into the body. \" the new t-cells then seek and destroy cancer, \" explains cnbc. \" this is unprecedented in medicine, to be honest, to get response rates in this range in these very advanced patients, \" says lead scientist stanley riddell. But the bbc adds some caveats: this was only a presentation, with the results not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, and so it's difficult to gauge the full significance. Plus, two patients in the study died after an \" extreme immune response. \" still, it seems further proof that \" the field of immunotherapy — harnessing the immune system to attack cancer — is coming of age, \" writes james gallagher. Along those lines, the telegraph picks up on a separate study at the same conference, one in which engineered immune cells introduced into patients 14 years ago were still present.

White house officials say this will simplify tax filings for millions and give middle-income families thousands more dollars to spend a year, boosting the economy.

Details of the plan were still being firmed up tuesday evening, the new york times reports, but the centerpiece remains slashing the business tax rate to 15 %. Democrats have been keen to point out that this would apply to entities like trump's real-estate empire as well as standard corporations.

A union representing the workers will today file a claim with the national labor relations board seeking an injunction requiring walmart to rehire everyone, the new york times reports. As it stands now, walmart says the workers — who were given just hours of notice that the stores would be closed for six months — may be able to find work at another store; the injunction would require the company to find them work at another store or reopen the stores where they used to work. The claim also accuses walmart of an ulterior motive for closing the stores. The united food and commercial workers international union — acting on behalf of our walmart, a non-union group that has been airing claims of poor working conditions — says walmart is retaliating because one of the closed stores, in pico rivera, calif., has been a hub for labor activism and hosted the first strike by walmart workers for better pay and conditions. Walmart denies any such retaliation, and in response to the injunction, a rep says, \" we don't believe there is a basis for an injunction that would interfere with our efforts to repair the serious plumbing issues at the five stores. \" over the weekend, the company gave a few more details, with a rep telling upi, \" the issues mostly relate to clogs and water leaks in the plumbing — we have had persistent issues over the last several years. \"",

        "summary": "For hayward duresseau, a \" terrifying \" diagnosis ended in one of the happiest moments of his life. The 27-year-old had just visited san francisco with boyfriend kerry kennedy in february when he grew exhausted, lost some vision, got a killer headache, and fell violently ill — which landed him in an emergency room in their hometown of lafayette, louisiana, reports nbc news. His eye problem soon developed into hearing loss and a new diagnosis: bacterial meningococcal meningitis, a possibly fatal infection that webmd says inflames membranes covering the spinal cord and brain. An outbreak had just struck san francisco, spreading by prolonged contact with a carrier via kissing or shared food or water, per buzzfeed. \" when he was first diagnosed, it was terrifying, \" kennedy said. \" i was really scared. I wasn't sure if he was ever going to leave the hospital. \" but kennedy, 37, stayed by duresseau's side for his three weeks in hospital and six months of recovery. Paralyzed from the hips down, duresseau did regain mobility and sight but lost all hearing — so the couple learned american sign language together, reports people. When a cochlear implant allowed him to hear again, the first thing he heard was kennedy's marriage proposal: down on one knee, kennedy asked, \" will you marry me? \" amid tears and laughter, duresseau said one word: \" yes. \" see the video on kennedy's facebook page, where he writes, \" these have been some of the most challenging months of our lives, but we made it together. \"",

Since monday alone, there have been 60 quake recordings, per the los angeles times, though most have been so small that no one noticed ( they're taking place about 5 or 6 miles underground, per the us geological survey ). The largest one recorded was a 3.6-magnitude shaker on oct. 19. These earthquake \" swarms \" aren't unusual in the golden state, though they're more prevalent in other areas, including the regions near mammoth lakes and imperial valley, per the times. \" the good news is that most of these earthquakes stay under magnitude 4, \" a usgs earthquake science center spokeswoman tells the san francisco chronicle. The usgs also notes that these tiny tremors don't necessarily mean a havoc-wreaking seismic event is around the corner — experts say there's only a 7 % chance of there being a quake of 6.7 magnitude or higher over the next three decades, the chronicle notes — and that the current swarm could continue for a few more weeks before finally dying down. \" i've not felt so many tremors in decades, \" a local tells nbc bay area. \" my dog … [ is ] the first one to know a couple of seconds before. \" ( a controversial nasa study warns that the la area will be hit within a few years with a major quake. )",

An amendment by michigan republican justin amash would have prevented the agency from gathering data under the program revealed by edward snowden, but the measure failed by 12 votes after heavy pressure from the white house. Despite that pressure, 111 democrats voted with amash to curtail the program. The vote united \" libertarian-leaning republicans and liberal democrats \" who were worried about privacy violations, says the wall street journal. It also managed to unite the white house with house republican leaders for once, notes the new york times. Under amash's proposal, the nsa could collect phone records only if they pertained to an individual who was under investigation. The mass \" metadata \" gathering would end. The prospect worried the nation's top intelligence officials, who made last-minute pleas to lawmakers to keep the tool in place. White house spokesman jay carney even made what the hill calls a rare evening statement before the vote calling the amendment misguided.",

Researchers studied 5,583 us children between 1996 and 2001; they found that girls ages nine to 14 who downed an average of more than 1.5 sugary drinks each day experienced their first periods 2.7 months earlier than girls who had no more than two each week, the press association reports via the guardian. That's of some concern, experts say, because earlier periods have been linked to a higher risk of breast cancer. Obesity has also been associated with earlier periods, but the study's findings held true \" independently of body mass index, \" says a researcher; the results were also independent of physical activity and overall food intake, today reports. One possible explanation is that added-sugar beverages can drive up insulin, which can increase sex hormone concentrations, which in turn can lead to earlier periods. ( diet sodas and fruit juices weren't linked to earlier periods, medical daily reports. ) today points to one issue with the study: it didn't define the serving size involved. And an outside expert wonders whether 2.7 months really means much — but the lead author says it does. The results \" are actually very powerful because consumption of these kinds of drinks is something that can be modified, \" she notes.

A study of girls aged nine to 14 found that those averaging more than 1.5 sugar-sweetened beverages a day had their first period 2.7 months earlier than those consuming two a week or fewer. The difference of a few months is not great, but the researchers say it may be significant because earlier onset menstrual periods are among the factors contributing to an increased risk of breast cancer later in life. However, one expert said the small change may not be hugely biologically relevant.

A study of girls aged nine to 14 found that those averaging more than 1.5 sugar-sweetened beverages a day had their first period 2.7 months earlier than those consuming two a week or fewer. The difference of a few months is not great, but the researchers say it may be significant because earlier onset menstrual periods are among the factors contributing to an increased risk of breast cancer later in life. However, one expert said the small change may not be hugely biologically relevant. Sugary drinks are widely thought to be contributing to childhood obesity, which is already known to be a factor in earlier onset of menstruation. The lead researcher in the us study, dr karin michels, of harvard medical school, said",
            "It's well documented soda isn't good for the body, doesn't provide any nutrients or benefits other than a slight caffeine high and sugar buzz, but now experts have discovered a danger floating in the liquid sugar permanently changes little girls ' hormones. Researchers from harvard school of public health found an alarming new danger of soda consumption and published their findings in the journal human reproduction. \" our study adds to increasing concern about the wide-spread consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks among children and adolescents in the usa and elsewhere, \" the study's lead researcher karin michels, a professor at harvard medical school, said in a press release. \" the main concern is about childhood obesity, but our study suggests that age of first menstruation ( menarche ) occurred earlier, independently of body mass index, among girls with the highest consumption of drinks sweetened with added sugar."

An officer on patrol in winter haven, florida, saw the four children ( an 8-year-old, 7-year-old twins, and a 6-year-old, wptv reports ) at the park tuesday around noon, and parked to observe them since there were no adults in the area. She says they waved her over a few minutes later because the 8-year-old boy had gotten stuck in a toddler swing, and they needed help. She couldn't free him and called the fire department to help; the children's mother, 28-year-old ashley richardson, arrived about two and a half hours after the officer first noticed the kids, bay news 9 reports. After the boy was set loose from the swing, the officer asked the kids where they lived, and they initially couldn't tell her. She says she then watched them continue playing — including climbing up on a sign and playing near a road and a lakefront — and ultimately they did tell her they lived less than half a mile away, jezebel reports. When richardson arrived, just after the officer called for assistance, she was arrested and now faces four counts of negligent child abuse without bodily harm. She told officers she had gone to a local food bank and didn't think she'd be gone so long. There's been backlash over the arrest, but the police chief says, \" i [ have ] met some pretty mature 6, 7, 8-year-olds but you don't leave them unattended. \" ( this mom and this mom were also recently arrested for letting their kids play at the park alone, and this mom was arrested for swearing in front of her kids. )",

It's a big step for google and other companies developing autonomous vehicles, expediting a process they say has been hampered by safety mandates at both state and federal levels. Google's cars, for instance, are currently required to have auto safety features such as brake pedals and steering wheels so the human driver ( another requirement ) would be able to take over the car's operation if need be — which google insists can lead to trouble. The company \" [ expressed ] concern that providing human occupants of the vehicle with mechanisms to control things … could be detrimental to safety because the human occupants could attempt to override the ( self-driving system's ) decisions, \" the nhtsa letter notes. Re/code, however, notes the nhtsa letter isn't law, but simply a \" clarification \" of how the law can be interpreted in the future.

The halloween &amp; costume organization has launched a change.org petition in support of moving the spooky holiday to the last saturday in october, with some 7,400 people currently on board. Halloween, or \" all hallows ' eve, \" falls on oct. 31 simply because that's the eve of nov. 1, which was declared by pope gregory iii to be a day honoring all saints, reports good housekeeping. But the trade group says the move would mean less stress for parents, greater parental supervision of trick-or-treaters, and improved safety ( the petition references the 3,800 halloween-related injuries that occur each year ). It's an argument meant to convince president trump, at whom the petition is directed. If congress wants to weigh in on when it should be celebrated, however, halloween will first need to be declared a federal holiday. ( a mayor plans to round up sex offenders on halloween. )",

The halloween &amp; costume organization just launched a campaign to move halloween to the last saturday of october, and lots of families have already hopped on board. The trade group argues that a weekend celebration would allow for greater parental supervision and child safety by trick-or-treating during daylight hours — not to mention more time to celebrate without the stress of the work or school week. \" we feel the change is inevitable and that in the end, the logic behind creating a safer, longer halloween will prevail, \" hca chairman kevin johnson said in a statement. So far the group's efforts have garnered more than 900 signatures on change.org. The holiday's fixed date stems from its religious origins in the eighth century, when pope gregory iii declared november 1 as a day to honor all saints. A tradition then developed to celebrate the dead on the preceding night, which later became what we know today as halloween. Despite its religious roots, most americans currently treat october 31 as a commercial holiday — and some parents think moving it to a saturday would make life a lot easier for them and their kids. Let's start by breaking down the positives, shall we? the pros it's easier for parents to celebrate with their kids versus rushing home after work. Children could trick-or-treat during daylight hours when it's potentially safer. You could spend the whole day celebrating instead of a few hours at night. Kids can still get a good night's sleep after staying out late. The cons but before we do anything too crazy, don't forget: the u.s. Has celebrated halloween on october 31st since the mid-19th century. Halloween literally means \" all hallows ' eve \" — a.k.a. The night before november 1. Half the fun of halloween as kid is staying up late on a school night. You just can't mess with tradition! so there you have it. Fair warning though: right now the government does not recognize halloween as a federal holiday, so not only would congress have to pass a law adding it to the official calendar, but they'd also have to agree on when to celebrate it. Getting any kind of consensus out of washington right now is a lot easier said than done, but if you really love halloween, it might be worth a shot."

( that story resulted in the loss of internet privileges for the website. ) the tweet from kessler — assuming his account wasn't hacked — has quickly drawn condemnation from well-known figures on the alt-right, reports the los angeles times. Richard spencer, for example, declared: \" i will no longer associate w/ jason kessler; no one should. Heyer's death was deeply saddening. ' payback ' is a morally reprehensible idea. \" another prominent figure in the movement, tim gionet, aka baked alaska, called the kessler tweet \" terribly wrong and vile. \" kessler's hometown newspaper, meanwhile, the daily progress, interviews people who know, or knew, the 33-year-old and say he held liberal beliefs as recently as a few years ago. Perhaps the most eye-popping interview comes with a former girlfriend, who describes herself as a progressive democrat and says that kessler knew about her jewish heritage and wasn't bothered by it. She says she dated him for several months in 2013 and says he dumped her because she wasn't \" liberal enough. \" kessler, for his part, has said that he leaned left until being \" red-pilled \" about three years ago, a reference to the matrix.
