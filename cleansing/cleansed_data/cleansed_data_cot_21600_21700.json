        "summary": "Even if you don't do drugs, there's a surprisingly decent chance your fingerprints have traces of cocaine and even heroin. Researchers from the university of surrey in britain found that slightly more than 1 in 10 drug-free study participants had cocaine in their prints and 1 % had heroin, per a university news release at physorg. They chalk it up to the prevalence of the drugs in society, with users handling cash and other items that wind up in wide circulation. The study was fairly small, involving 50 drug-free people and another 15 who'd used cocaine or heroin in the previous 24 hours. Scientists used solvents to extract substances from the prints for analysis, explains iflscience. They also had the various subjects shake hands, and the clean users showed traces of the drugs after a handshake with drug users. \" believe it or not, cocaine is a very common environmental contaminant — it is well known that it is present on many bank notes, \" says surrey researcher melanie bailey. \" even so, we were surprised that it was detected in so many of our fingerprint samples. \" the good news? the researchers were able to set a threshold and pick out the prints of the actual drug users from the innocents. It's no mere scientific exercise: in its coverage, the telegraph takes note of a bus driver who got fired for failing a drug test and later won a settlement for unfair dismissal. Turns out, he routinely handled money contaminated by cocaine. ( this woman was ordered by a court to use her fingerprint to unlock her phone. )",

Around 13 per cent of fingerprints of those who had never used the drugs were found to contain cocaine, while one per cent contained a metabolite of heroin.

The times says the four soldiers were at first deemed mia by the pentagon, indicating they were believed alive when the french choppers left; us officials contend american, french, and nigerien forces were still on the ground. The pentagon also said thursday this unit had been backup for a second one on the hunt for an islamic operative, though that second unit's raid had been called off, per cbs news; the ambushed unit was told to stay behind and gather evidence. Meanwhile, a nigerien soldier who arrived on the scene as the attack wound down tells cnn he saw troops \" ready to fight until the end \" and that he'd run into the unit the day before — nowhere near ready for combat, dressed in \" t-shirts and baseball caps \" with just one heavy machine gun among them and no body armor.

Their squad mates immediately alerted commanders that they were under attack — then called for help nearly an hour later, as a top pentagon official said this week — and ground forces from niger's army and french mirage jets were both dispatched.

        "summary": "Not only do cod \" speak \" to each other, but they have \" regional fish accents \" — kind of like the aquatic version of a southern drawl — and that could be bad news for fish-and-chips lovers, wired reports. According to the boston globe, marine biologist steve simpson recently started a two-year project to study the sounds surrounding cod. Cod \" speak \" by vibrating their swim bladders, but the noises they make vary based on where their breeding grounds are located. For example, us cod make a \" deep thumping sound, \" while cod in norway make a \" higher-pitched sound, with a long growl, \" usa today reports. Similar \" regional dialects \" have been detected in birds and various mammals, including, obviously, humans. The problem is that rising ocean temperatures are forcing cod north, and they're bumping up against groups with different accents. Simpson says this could hurt their ability to successfully breed, the telegraph reports. Male cod use sounds to convince females to release their eggs. That process would be difficult if they can't understand each other. But that's not the only problem. Noise from boats and other man-made sources could be making it harder for the cod to hear each other. \" we may find that the 'gossip ' essential to their society is being drowned out, \" wired quotes simpson as saying. \" if we value our fish stocks — or our friday night fish supper — we need to understand this. \" ( the \" holy grail \" of ornamental fish is disappearing. )",

Wkyc reports the 44-year-old woodbury elementary school teacher was stabbed to death saturday morning and found in her driveway; mason allegedly tried to flee the scene and hit a police car in the process, injuring himself and an officer. He was subsequently arrested. Cleveland.com reports lance mason was sentenced to two years in prison over the 2014 assault and served nine months. As part of his release, he wrote fraser mason a letter that explained he \" failed as a husband, father, and a man \" and would work to become better in the latter two categories; fraser mason filed for divorce shortly after the assault, though it hadn't been finalized at the time of her death. Mason can no longer serve as a judge and saw his law license indefinitely suspended, but he was hired last year by cleveland mayor frank jackson as a minority business development director. He was fired after news of the arrest broke. A gofundme campaign set up for the couple's daughters, one of whom cleveland.com reports has down syndrome, has thus far raised $ 76,000.

Someone edited the magazine's image to instead appear to show gonzalez ripping up the constitution. ( see both the original version and the fake version at buzzfeed. ) the fake version was shared by both verified and unverified accounts on twitter, and the washington post reports that its biggest boost came when actor adam baldwin shared it with the caption, \" #vorwärts! \" — the word \" forward \" in german and an apparent reference to hitler youth. Many appeared to take the gif ( as well as still images appearing to show the same thing ) as fact, though others, including professor donald moynihan, debunked it: \" just a sample of what nra supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre \" he tweeted, alongside a comparison of the real and the fake images. Meanwhile, teen vogue is running the real images along with gonzalez's op-ed on gun control, in which she outlines what the teen activists want: \" we need to digitize gun-sales records, mandate universal background checks, close gun-show loopholes and straw-man purchases, ban high-capacity magazines, and push for a comprehensive assault weapons ban with an extensive buyback system, \" she writes.

        "summary": "A baby boom among native americans that started some 1,500 years ago was so massive that birth rates likely surpassed the highest found anywhere in the world today, according to researchers scouring data tied to thousands of human remains found at hundreds of sites across the region where arizona, new mexico, colorado, and utah meet. It was a centuries-long rise followed by a sudden and dramatic fall, one that should serve as a warning sign about the dangers of overpopulation, the anthropologists conclude. \" we can learn lessons from these people, \" one of the paper's authors says in a news release. As early as 2000 bc, corn was grown in the region, though it wasn't until 400 bc that consumption of it jumped. It become the dominant calorie source, and propelled birth rates to peak levels around 500 ad, by which time discover reports the people were utilizing \" two hallmarks of civilization: settled agriculture and food storage. \" per the study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, that birth rate then \" remained at high levels with some fluctuation \" for centuries. But by the mid-1100s, a terrible drought hit hard, and conflicts arose; still the birth rate stayed high right until 1280, by which time farmers seem to have had enough and fled. Within 30 years the area of 40,000 people was empty. The population may have simply grown too large to feed itself, researchers surmise, leaving behind a lesson: overpopulation is not sustainable.",

This most recent probe ( the times says there have been more than 50 around the country ) is part of federal efforts to cut down on the 250,000 or so disabled people under the age of 65 \" unfairly \" placed in nursing homes — what a 2013 senate committee report says flouts the americans with disabilities act and violates a supreme court ruling made nearly two decades ago. \" regardless of their age, people with disabilities deserve privacy, autonomy, and dignity in their everyday lives, \" the head of the doj's civil rights division says in the report. One 73-year-old tells the times some nursing homes are nothing more than \" warehouses, \" with the paper noting patients are often kept from cooking their own meals or going out with friends unless they're signed out — \" like a kid, \" another resident says. The 1999 supreme court case anchoring this civil rights dilemma, olmstead vs. Lc, ruled that, under the ada, people with disabilities have a right to receive help without being segregated from the rest of society. South dakota gov.

In a scathing rebuke of the state's health care system, the justice department said on monday that thousands of patients were being held unnecessarily in sterile, highly restrictive group homes.

Title iv, which is regulated by the federal communications commission ( fcc ), also requires closed captioning of federally funded public service announcements. While the u.s.

In a scathing rebuke of the state's health care system, the justice department said on monday that thousands of patients were being held unnecessarily in sterile, highly restrictive group homes.

The headline describes him as \" fighter, prisoner, president, and symbol. \" while admiring that he \" sometimes chafed at the saintlike celebrity that cloaked him late in life, \" the los angeles times notes in a 4,000-word obit that mandela was \" an inspiration to millions \" and a \" revered symbol of racial reconciliation around the world. \" not only that, \" he was indeed the father of the nation, \" writes alec russell for the financial times. \" don't put me on a pedestal, i am human, he liked to say. He once bemoaned his image as a demigod. Yet who could dispute that he presides over the pantheon of great leaders of the 20th century? \" he was \" a leader of mythic stature \" who \" radiated an image of moral rectitude expressed in measured tones, often leavened by a mischievous humor, \" the chicago tribune notes. But perhaps the best way to remember him is with his own words. \" he stays behind the flock, \" he wrote of a tribal council chief in his autobiography, per the ny times, \" letting the most nimble go out ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind. \"",

That's why an international panel now recommends office workers stand at least two hours a day, eventually bumping that to four hours, per a press release. The new guidelines, published in the british journal of sports medicine, note that half of daily time on your butt is spent in \" prolonged periods of sustained sitting, \" which doesn't bode well: according to existing research, study authors found those who sit the most are twice as likely as colleagues who often stand to develop cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and have a 17 % increased risk of dying from cancer, the guardian reports. \" we are creatures of habit and we have come to the wrong conclusion that sitting is the optimum way of conducting office work, \" says gavin bradley, a co-author who set up the get britain standing website. The guidelines advocate for sit-stand desks, taking regular walking breaks, and doing certain tasks while standing, the guardian notes. In fact, workers are actually more productive at certain tasks when off their butts, including checking email, bradley tells the paper. He starts his own day standing on a comfort mat and has his sit-stand desk inform him via alert to switch up his posture every 20 minutes or so, per the washington post. \" just getting up for five minutes is going to get things going again. These things are so simple they're almost stupid, \" he tells the post. One caveat: the guidelines warn that one shouldn't stand for too long in one position, either. ( also: don't run too much, because that could be bad for you, too. )",

        "summary": "Gillian genser is a canadian sculptor who works only with natural materials, and in toronto life magazine, she recounts her own personal medical mystery. About 20 years ago, she began suffering debilitating symptoms such as constant headaches, frequent vomiting, aching muscles, and cramped hands. Specialists couldn't figure it out. Did she work with toxic materials, they'd ask? nope, only natural ones, particularly crushed mussel shells for a large sculpture of the biblical figure adam she'd been working on. \" i spent up to 12 hours a day grinding and sanding the shells to fit into the shape of adam's body, \" she writes. The symptoms continued for 15 years, then worsened significantly in 2013. It was around that time that she visited a museum and learned mussels absorbed toxins in their environment. Subsequent tests revealed high levels of arsenic and lead in her blood — she had chronic heavy-metal poisoning. \" my body was carrying a painful message about the poisoning that earth is experiencing, \" she writes. The 59-year-old genser immediately stopped working with the shells, of course, but she continues \" to live with many neurological and metabolic symptoms \" and says she will never fully recover. Genser tells the washington post that she finds it \" interesting and ironic \" that her statue of adam, intended as an environmental statement about man's perceived dominion over nature, ended up being the main culprit. Not that she blames the mussels. \"i feel terrible grief for them, \" she says. \" we did this to them, they didn't do it to me. \" ( read her full essay, entitled \" my beautiful death, \" here. )",

Police departments in the state are starting to offer up their lobbies as \" safe havens \" where buyers and sellers from craigslist or other online markets can meet to make their transactions, the chicago tribune reports, and it's a trend in place in other states as well. It's a \" preventative measure, \" says the police commander in naperville, who explains that most crime related to online transactions in the chicago suburb is scam-related and does not involve face-to-face transactions. Police aren't actually involved in the transactions, but more departments — including the chicago pd — are recommending people meet there just in case, or, if not a police department, then a well-lit public place. One town manager in an indiana town that is offering similar safe zones says buyers and sellers can even request a police officer be present. Many officials stress that in-person crime related to craigslist transactions is rare, but the tribune notes that other operations have been started across the nation to help buyers and sellers find safe places to meet, including police lobbies and parking lots, and a search for \" craigslist safe zones \" returns numerous examples.

        "summary": "France's \" horror dentist \" won't get close to a patient's teeth again. Dutchman jacobus van nierop, 51, was convicted of aggravated assault and fraud in the french town of nevers on tuesday, banned from practicing dentistry, sentenced to eight years in jail, and fined $ 11,900, reports the telegraph. Initial reports claimed van nierop admitted responsibility for maiming 120 patients in the small town of chateau-chinon from 2008 to 2012 — who suffered broken jaws, recurrent abscesses, and blood poisoning — adding he \" wasn't interested in people \" and had no memory of his patients, per the bbc. Van nierop fled france for canada after his arrest in 2013 and fought extradition, per the guardian. He \" claimed to have killed his first wife, he played crazy, he said he was trans-sexual, \" says a member of the victims ' association. He was eventually returned to france, where his defense team said he suffered \" psychological problems. \" an expert claimed he wasn't responsible for his actions because of \" narcissistic tendencies. \" a prosecutor, however, said the dentist \" took pleasure \" in performing \" useless and painful procedures. \" one woman said van nierop pulled out eight of her teeth, leaving her \" gushing blood for three days. \"",

Hakeem jeffries, citing \" several unanswered questions as it relates to the behavior of the father. \" police say the victim and her 39-year-old dad — described by neighbors as an alcoholic — were heavily intoxicated when approached by five teens on thursday night, per the new york times. It isn't clear under what circumstances the father fled; an initial report claimed the teens forced him away at gunpoint, but the victim says she didn't see a gun and the suspects deny having one. Authorities say the father threw a bottle at the suspects before returning with officers 12 minutes later. The woman, found alone and half-clothed, told police she was raped by at least one suspect and forced to perform oral sex on two, while all five touched her breasts. \" i was just really scared, \" the woman tells wabc. She says she screamed for help, but none came. The suspects are telling a vastly different story, according to the new york daily news: they say they first found the woman having sex with her father, and that any sex was consensual; they're expected to plead not guilty in court on tuesday. However, the woman's injuries \" are consistent with being physically attacked, \" an officer says. Authorities have found no witnesses, though \" distant video \" shows five figures leaving the playground. Video also shows the victim and her father entering the park after buying beer around 9pm. Officials say the victim, who was raised by an adoptive family, only recently reconnected with her father. On sunday, \" he said, ' i have no idea what they're doing around here, \" \" referring to reporters and cops, a neighbor says. \" he said, ' i didn't do nothing.

The father said the teenagers entered the playground brandishing a gun, and that he ran off, the officials said. Two minutes later, he returned and threw a bottle at the teenagers, to try to drive them off, but they chased him again, the officials said. When he returned 12 minutes later with police officers, the assailants were gone and his daughter was there, half clothed. When she was interviewed, the woman told investigators she was raped by at least one of the suspects, the officials said. She was forced to perform oral sex on two others, they said, citing her account, and all of the suspects touched her breasts. \"the initial report, that all five of them raped her, is not looking like it happened that way, \" one of the officials said. Two of the suspects said a third suspect had sex with the woman. That suspect said he was present, but was on the phone, \"and when he finished the call his friends were gone, \" one of the officials said. The woman did not report seeing a gun and so far, the suspects have denied they had one. The father and daughter were heavily intoxicated during the attack, the official said.

The father said the teenagers entered the playground brandishing a gun, and that he ran off, the officials said. Two minutes later, he returned and threw a bottle at the teenagers, to try to drive them off, but they chased him again, the officials said.

That suspect said he was present, but was on the phone, \"and when he finished the call his friends were gone, \" one of the officials said.

In a subsequent interview with amy schumer, dunham offered up this: \" i was sitting next to odell beckham jr., and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined i was not the shape of a woman by his standards, \" said dunham. \" he was like,'that's a marshmallow. That's a child. That's a dog. ' it wasn't mean — he just seemed confused. \" she later joked that beckham sized her up, rejected the idea of sex, and turned instead to his phone. As people notes, dunham quickly faced a barrage of online criticism afterward, with people accusing her of unfairly dissing beckham and sounding hypocritical about the objectification of women. Dunham explained in a tweet friday that the story was really about her \" own insecurities, \" but then flippantly chalked up the backlash to the \" outrage machine. \" on saturday, however, she posted a lengthy apology on instagram. \" i went ahead and projected these insecurities and made totally narcissistic assumptions about what he was thinking, then presented those assumptions as facts, \" she writes. \" i feel terrible about it.

But now, per the los angeles times, the mystery protester, whose hijab-waving video went viral, vanished soon after, reportedly arrested for violating the country's modesty laws and spurring the #whereisshe and #where_is_she hashtags. Witnesses say two female cops detained her, and prominent human-rights attorney nasrin sotoudeh confirmed to the bbc the woman was indeed arrested on dec. 27, released not long after, and then rearrested. Sotoudeh adds that the woman is a 31-year-old mother of a toddler. The woman wasn't officially part of the iranian protests that have recently gripped the nation, but she's become a symbol for those criticizing the government. She's said to have made her stick-and-hijab flag on a wednesday, which is the day of the week when those who push back against modesty laws — requiring women to cover their hair with hijabs, among other mandates — do so by donning white. The countrywide demonstrations against national corruption and economic woes didn't start until the next day, but one poster that's circulating shows a rendering of the woman's hijab flag facing down a police baton, with the hashtag #oursisstronger. Per radio free europe, amnesty international has released a statement calling for authorities to \" immediately and unconditionally \" let her go and \" to end the persecution of women who speak out against compulsory veiling, and abolish this discriminatory and humiliating practice. \" ( iran has banned its primary schools from teaching english. )",

That's because amazon has an invitation-only program, vine, for top reviewers — and at least once a month, they get to choose two free products from a list and must review them within 30 days. The reasoning: products are more likely to sell if they have reviews, even bad ones. Npr talks to one member, currently the no. 1 reviewer on amazon, who says he's gotten such pricey items as a $ 500 laser printer and a $ 1,000 spin bike for free. Michael erb ( m. Erb to amazon users ) has written so many reviews ( 863 so far ), manufacturers have just started sending him stuff directly. But as business insider points out, being no. 1 isn't a matter of volume, but the result of a mysterious algorithm that factors in things like quality and helpfulness; in terms of the latter, erb often goes so far as to include video demos in his reviews. ( here's an example... For a cardboard box. ) \" literally every other day there's ups boxes piled up at the door, \" erb says. The site can ask for the products back at anytime — though it never has in his five years as a \" vine voice \" — and he can't sell or give away the freebies. One expert says vine members might be biased toward offering more positive reviews than people who actually paid for their purchases, and the verge points out that the vine designation attached to these reviews \" wouldn't be hard to glance over. \" but an amazon rep says vine reviews have, on average, fewer stars than non-vine reviews. Of erb's last 10 reviews, there are two 3-star reviews, three 4-star reviews, and five 5-star reviews.",

        "summary": "Scientists have finally figured out the reason behind a small but noticeable uptick in the temperature of the moon's subsurface while it was under study by astronauts of the apollo missions in the 1970s. The culprit? blame those very same astronauts. The cbc explains: astronauts walking on the moon or riding around in rovers disturbed the surface soil and exposed the darker soil beneath. The darker soil then absorbed more of the sun's heat instead of reflecting it away, and that resulted in the temperatures rising 1.8 degrees to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit from 1971 to 1977. The readings came from probes sunk into the moon in 1971 and 1972 by astronauts, and the data was collected through 1977, according to a release at phys.org. \" you can actually see the astronauts'tracks, where they walked, \" says walter kiefer of the lunar and planetary institute, co-author of the new study in the journal of geophysical research. \" and we can see … where they scuffed dirt up — and what it leaves behind is a darker path. \" the revelation holds lessons for future space exploration, adds lead author seiichi nagihara of texas tech university. \" in the process of installing the instruments you may actually end up disturbing the surface thermal environment of the place where you want to make some measurements. \" one reason the discovery took so long is that the last few years of data were long thought to be missing, but texas tech resesarchers found 440 of the missing tapes, then spent years restoring them, reports science alert.

In 1971 and 1972, nasa deployed sensors on the moon during the apollo 15 and 17 missions in an effort to measure the moon's surface and subsurface temperatures — a project dubbed the heat flow experiment.

Now a team of researchers from texas tech university has found and restored that data - and discovered that the source of the warming was actually the presence of humans. The experiment was called the heat flow experiment, and it was designed to determine the rate at which the interior of the moon loses heat. Astronauts with apollo 15 and 17 drilled holes into the lunar surface, up to depths of 2.3 metres, and probes measured the temperature at several depths in the holes.

            "It may have been one giant leap for man, but those steps may have consequences for mankind. The presence of astronauts on the moon caused an unexpected warming of its subsurface temperatures for a period of time in the 1970s, a new study has found after delving into \" lost \" tapes from the apollo missions. In 1971 and 1972, nasa deployed sensors on the moon during the apollo 15 and 17 missions in an effort to measure the moon's surface and subsurface temperatures — a project dubbed the heat flow experiment. Data was collected and beamed back down to earth until 1977, where scientists were baffled by the gradual warming of the moon's surface being read by the sensors.

After eight years spent recovering lost moon data from the apollo missions, scientists report in a new study they've solved a decades-old mystery of why the moon's subsurface warmed slightly during the 1970s. Scientists have wondered about the cause of the warming since soon after the apollo missions started, when astronauts deployed probes on the moon to measure the heat coming from its interior. The lost data tapes recovered by the scientists filled in a record gap during the 1970s and helped the researchers pinpoint the source of the warming as the apollo astronauts themselves. The astronauts disturbed the moon's surface soil by walking and driving a rover on it. As",
            "Between 1971 and 1977, apollo scientists conducting experiments on the moon discovered that the surface of our li ' l satellite buddy got mysteriously warmer. But the data from 1974 onwards went missing, and the strange warming phenomenon remained an enigma. Now a team of researchers from texas tech university has found and restored that data - and discovered that the source of the warming was actually the presence of humans. The experiment was called the heat flow experiment, and it was designed to determine the rate at which the interior of the moon loses heat. Astronauts with apollo 15 and 17 drilled holes into the lunar surface, up to depths of 2.3 metres, and probes measured the temperature at several depths in the holes. These were long-term experiments, left in place after the astronauts departed, and transmitting data back to earth. At the apollo 15 site, the surface and subsurface temperatures"

Per ksbw, a teacher at seaside high school in monterey county ( also 2013's reserve officer of the year for the sand city pd and trained in firearms, per the washington post ) was demonstrating \" public safety \" tuesday for his administration of justice class with a semiautomatic handgun. But as dennis alexander was handling the weapon, it fired while pointed upward, sending the bullet ricocheting off the ceiling, seaside police chief abdul pridgen tells the monterey herald. Pridgen says one student suffered non-life-threatening wounds to his neck from either falling debris or \" fragmentation \" — not from a bullet, per the monterey county weekly — and that class went on after the dust literally settled. Ksbw reports two other students also had minor injuries. \" it's the craziest thing. It could have been very bad, \" the dad of the 17-year-old student with the hurt neck says, adding school officials never checked to see if any students were injured, and that he and his son's mother were the ones who noticed his bloody shirt and neck injuries when he got home. Alexander, meanwhile, who's been a reserve officer for 11 years, has been placed on leave from both the school and the sand city pd. \" i have concerns about why he was displaying a loaded firearm in a classroom, \" that department's chief says. Seaside's pridgen tells the herald: \" we're looking into any violation of city ordinance or the penal code and we ' ll determine whether or not there are any applicable charges. \" ksbw notes california teachers aren't allowed to bring firearms into classrooms, even with concealed carry permits.",

The study looked at a caffeine marker called paraxanthine — one of the compounds caffeine breaks down into — in 2,197 women at two different points during their pregnancies, then compared those levels to the child's iq scores and behavioral assessments at ages 4 and 7. \" we did not find evidence of an adverse association of maternal pregnancy caffeine consumption with child cognition or behavior [ at those ages ], \" study co-author mark klebanoff adds.

        "summary": "Many people have been fawning over taylor swift since her open letter to apple convinced the company to do an about-face and pay musicians for music streamed during a user's apple music free trial period. But a number of people, chief among them pandora's former chief technology officer, are now pointing out some problems with the idea that this is somehow a victory for artists: that ex-cto, tom conrad, posted a series of tweets yesterday pointing out that spotify, youtube, pandora, and other music streaming services already pay artists for music streamed during free trial periods, time reports. Apple's 180 \" simply puts it at parity with all other players, \" he wrote, adding, \" reminder: apple uses music to make billions off hardware. Artists see nothing from this. Swift's letter and apple's response is mostly theater.... We shouldn't herald this move as progress. It's status quo. \" plus, he notes, there's the fact that swift has never gone after terrestrial radio ( on which her career was built and from which she doesn't get any money ), and — though she's criticized spotify for \" devaluing music \" — she's never pulled her music off youtube, which \" certainly devalues music if spotify does, \" conrad writes. That's because swift can't afford to pull her music off youtube — the site is too huge, and her fans would revolt, writes nilay patel in a post at the verge titled, \" taylor swift vs apple: nobody wins. \" as patel points out, \" it's only when the services have meaningful leverage that artists back down, \" and \" apple can't afford to have swift taking shots at apple music, while swift can just sit back and let her army of ultra-devoted fans actually buy her albums from itunes proper. \" but the only result of her campaign was to essentially ensure apple offers \" the same fundamental deal to artists and labels as the much-vilified spotify. \" and she wasn't alone in achieving that result, as npr notes: though she's getting most of the credit, independent music labels also played a big role in convincing apple to change its mind. Meanwhile, mashable notes that swift also had to respond to a freelance photog who accused her of doing the same thing to the people who photograph her shows.

The one-of-a-kind flight was documented for a jetblue mother's day ad released this week, adweek reports. After passengers were seated, a flight attendant announced, \" this will be the very first flight where crying babies is a good thing. \" to make that happen, jetblue offered a 25 % discount to passengers every time a baby started crying; so four fussy babies equaled a free flight. It worked.

The ad asks passengers to be patient and understanding of parents traveling with young children. \" it's difficult for moms who know that all eyes are on them as they make their way down a crowded aisle with a fussy baby, \" observes popsugar.

        "summary": "Shia labeouf is either engaging in some sort of grand \" performance art \" experiment, or he has a disorder that causes him to rampantly plagiarize. The latest incidents, pointed out by jesse david fox on vulture, are two more apologies labeouf tweeted ( one yesterday and one the day before ), apparently related to the original plagiarism scandal in which he's currently embroiled. Both of these latest apologies, though, were also copied — word for word and even, fox writes, \" hashtag for hashtag \" — from other apologies. The two latest plagiarized apologies are from celebrity big brother star jade goody and porn star mr. Marcus. But they're not the only recent plagiarisms from mr. Labeouf: last week, perez hilton pointed out that the actor had also \" apologized \" using the words of tiger woods, eliot spitzer, russell crowe, the nelson mandela funeral interpreter, the ceo of bp, alec baldwin, shepard fairey, and mark zuckerberg. And before that, defamer pointed out he'd also cribbed apologies from kanye west and robert mcnamara. That website and buzzfeed also rounded up many, many other instances in which labeouf appears to have plagiarized, so the documentary about all this trolling is sure to be coming soon.",

George conway, who the washington post notes is a respected conservative attorney, has written a 3,500-word piece in the lawfare blog whose headline pretty much sums things up: \" the terrible arguments against the constitutionality of the mueller investigation. \" conway gives the president a bit of a pass for his june 4 tweet complaining that the mueller appointment \" is totally unconstitutional! \" \" yes, it's a \" meritless legal position, \" writes conway, but trump is not a lawyer and thus \" wouldn't know the difference between a good one and a bad one. \" he's less forgiving of attorneys who make that case. \" the 'constitutional ' arguments made against the special counsel … have little more rigor than the tweet that promoted them, \" conway writes. \"such a lack of rigor, sadly, has been a disturbing trend in much of the politically charged public discourse about the law lately, and one that lawyers — regardless of their politics — owe a duty to abjure. \" conway suspects trump's opinion is based on an essay by legal scholar steven calabresi in the wall street journal, and conway picks apart calabresi's rationale that mueller has exceeded his authority. \"unfortunately for the president, \" conway writes, \"these writings are no more correct than the spelling in his original tweet. \" ( trump initially spelled \" counsel \" as \" councel. \" ) read the full essay here.

It notes sonya was able to escape by fleeing to a restroom, but bestler was overcome by the insects, whose \" hostility \" also kept bystanders and park employees at bay, the arizona republic reports. A group was finally able to get bestler, \" still covered with bees, \" into a police vehicle and to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A note on the park's website thursday morning indicated the trail and its vicinity had been closed due to \" aggressive bee activity, \" the washington post reports. \" these attacks are becoming more frequent and i urge the public to be aware of their surroundings when out in these areas, \" a statement from sheriff joe arpaio warned. The post backs up arpaio's claim, noting that bee attacks have been increasing in the southwest, with africanized bees ( aka \" killer bees \" ) responsible for some of the most aggressive strikes, though it hasn't been said yet what kind of bees were involved in bestler's case. \" they hate any movement, noise, or vibration, \" an arizona bee removal expert told the ap after a spate of africanized honeybee attacks last year. \" they hate everything. \" ( a woman in wales had her own terrifying bee experience — for two whole days. )",

Almost 12,000 gas and oil wells add to air pollution in vernal, utah — one of the nation's most energy-intensive areas — but many locals don't see a connection. \" i don't feel like it has anything to do with oil and gas, \" says a woman whose two infant boys died in 2011 and 2013. \" i just feel like it's a trial i was given. \" such disbelief \" could be tied \" to uintah county's monthly non-farm wage of $ 3,963, the state's highest, the post notes. Donna young, a vernal midwife who spotted the dead-baby spike, says many dads of babies she delivers have oil-field jobs. Using obituaries, she calculated that one in every 95.5 county burials in 2010 was a baby; in 2013, it was one in 15. \" i just really, really want to find out what is going on, \" says young, who has endured vandalism and received threats since revealing the deaths. She alerted an anesthesiologist in salt lake city who says air pollution is \" a part of it. \" the post notes that chemicals like benzene and toluene are released during drilling and have been shown to cause birth defects. Other research has established a correlation between poor baby health and nearby oil wells, but colorado's chief medical officer criticized those findings, i-news network reports. And other factors could be at play, like uintah county's high smoking, boozing, and obesity rates. The only vernal physician who responded to the post put it this way: \" i am unwilling to speculate until i see some proof that there actually is an increased rate of infant morbidity or mortality. \" ( more unusual medical news: doctors are stumped by a boy who's never hungry or thirsty. )",

Commissioner jeff powers did. \" powers did not respond to an interview request. Not to sound negative, but there might be a problem with south pittsburg's new policy. The first amendment protects free speech, especially free speech that criticizes the government. \"this policy is dangerously broad, \" said helen norton, a professor at the university of colorado school of law who studies free speech as it applies to government workers. \"it'd be one thing if it were just about job-required speech, \" she said, noting that, for example, press secretaries can be fired if they say something in their official role that an administration doesn '",

That's the new mantra for rainbow trout in china, which for years have been mislabeled as salmon and which now are getting an official shrug from authorities on that mislabeling. Even though a recent media expose revealed the fish fraud, new rules will allow rainbow trout to be packaged and sold within china as salmon. The bbc points out the two species'similarities ( namely, the pinkish color of their meat ), as well as their differences: their exteriors don't look the same, and trout live in freshwater, while salmon ditch freshwater for salt water after birth. But, per a government fishery group and more than a dozen chinese fishery companies, they're similar enough to elevate the rainbow trout to salmon status, per the global times. Both fish are in the salmonidae family, with \" salmon \" being the \" umbrella name, \" the government organization notes on its site. Most people might not care, except they're scared rainbow trout are prone to parasites. Some consumers have complained of worms in their trout ( especially concerning as people in china often scarf their fish raw ) and even say the trout have been painted to look more like salmon. Supchina also notes the qinghai province fishery busted in the expose and responsible for a third of china's salmon output is one of the fisheries involved in the rule change. The china fisheries association insists it's all good, as rainbow trout in china are raised in hygienic quarantine. All of this has spurred heated ( and often mocking ) debate under the #rainbowtroutbecomessalmon hashtag on chinese social media. \" let's label the crayfish a lobster instead, \" one commenter noted, per the bbc. \" can we label seas and lake as the same thing? \" another snarked. \" they are technically the same. \"",

        "summary": "Taylor swift counted another courtroom win tuesday, though the reason revolved around lyrics deemed by a judge to be \" unoriginal \" and \" uncreative. \" songwriters sean hall and nathan butler sued swift for copyright infringement last year, arguing that swift's 2014 hit \" shake it off \" borrowed heavily from their 2001 song \" playas gon ' play, \" performed by girl group 3lw, per the washington post. That song goes, \" playas, they gonna play, and haters, they gonna hate, \" while \" shake it off \" goes, \" players gonna play, play, play, play, play, and haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, \" reports variety. In a rather amusing verdict, federal court judge michael w. Fitzgerald dismissed the case, declaring that the lyrics were too commonplace to warrant protection. Swift's legal team made a similar argument, pointing to songs before 2001 with the same theme. Explaining that \" american popular culture was heavily steeped in the concepts of players, haters, and player haters \" by the time \" playas gon ' play \" was written, fitzgerald said \" the concept of actors acting in accordance with their essential nature is not at all creative; it is banal. \" he concluded \" the lyrics at issue... Are too brief, unoriginal, and uncreative to warrant protection under the copyright act. \" the case remains open for amendment in case some other similarities between the songs are uncovered. But a lawyer says hall and butler will instead appeal the ruling on the basis that fitzgerald made the \" embarrassing \" mistake of interpreting the originality of the lyrics himself, rather than seeking the opinion of a music expert, per the bbc.

Anonymous, a loosely defined group of hackers from all over the world, gathered about 500 supporters in online forums and used software tools to bring down the sites of the ministry of information and president hosni mubarak's national democratic party, said gregg housh, a member of the group who disavows any illegal activity himself. The sites were unavailable wednesday afternoon. The attacks, mr. Housh said, are part of a wider campaign that anonymous has mounted in support of the antigovernment protests that have roiled the arab world. Last month, the group shut down the web sites of the tunisian government and stock exchange in support of the uprising that forced the country's dictator, zine el-abidine ben ali, to flee. Mr. Housh said that the group had used its technical knowledge to help protesters in egypt defy a government shutdown of the internet that began last week. \"we want freedom, \" he said of the group's motivation. \"it's as simple as that. We're sick of oppressive governments encroaching on people. \" anonymous also mounted strikes late last year, characterized by some of its supporters as a \"cyberwar, \" against companies like mastercard, visa and paypal that had refused to process donations to the antisecrecy group wikileaks. The f.b.i. Said last week that it had executed 40 search warrants \"throughout the united states \" in connection with that campaign. The strikes by anonymous, known as \"distributed denial of service \" attacks, could lead to criminal charges that carry 10-year prison sentences, the f.b.i. Said. Arrests have been made and equipment seized in britain, the netherlands, sweden, germany and france, according to british and american officials. They declined to provide further details. Barrett brown, who is helping to organize a legal defense for those who might be prosecuted, said further raids were expected. Mr. Housh said \"these arrests aren't going to have any effect. \" just hours after the raids, he said, about 600 people, including many who had been arrested and then released, were back online and coordinating efforts in egypt."

That surface denial nearly rivals bill clinton's classic: \"i did not have sexual relations with that woman. \" but this is no laughing matter. There is nothing trivial about a secretary of state having top-secret information on an unsecured computer in her home. That appears to have been the case, based on the state department's announcement last week that 22 emails, across seven email chains, containing top-secret information were on hillary clinton's private email server. At issue is whether the information in the emails was classified when it was sent to her unsecured server. It was, after all, the state department, upon review of the content by intelligence agencies, that upgraded the emails to top-secret and ordered them withheld from the public. Now, it may well be that some of clinton's political opponents are out to derail her presidential campaign and are using the email controversy to do so. Or it could be the case, as clinton's supporters claim, that intergovernmental infighting over what is and isn't classified is driving this investigation. Cnn"

During those campaigns, mcmahon supported a lower corporate tax rate and a reduction in regulations, per cnbc. Trump has promised to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 % to 15 %, and ease regulations. Mcmahon now runs mentoring company women's leadership live, per politico. In announcing his decision, trump described mcmahon as \" one of the country's top female executives advising businesses around the globe \" who \" helped grow wwe from a modest 13-person operation to a publicly traded global enterprise with more than 800 employees in offices worldwide. \" she will be a \" champion for small businesses and unleash america's entrepreneurial spirit all across the country, \" trump adds.

        "summary": "While many studies have investigated whether cellphone radiation is harmful, little is known about how the sound of a cellphone ringing might impact a baby in utero. So researchers in new york decided to dig, in part because resident physicians — who regularly use cellphones and beepers at work — seem to have more pregnancy complications. Their study is small and has yet to be peer-reviewed or published, but the researchers say their findings, to be presented at a meeting of the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists in san francisco this week, warrant further investigation. \" cycles of normal fetal behavior are definitely disturbed or interrupted by the frequent use of cellphones and beepers, \" one of the researchers tells the philadelphia inquirer. \" if you're a baby in-utero and someone wakes you up every hour, you will not be a happy camper. \" to test the possible link, they used high-quality ultrasound on 28 pregnant medical residents in their third trimester and observed how the fetuses reacted to the sounds of cellphones ringing and beepers beeping when attached at the hip to the mothers'scrubs ( ie, close to the babies ' heads ). Almost every time, the babies would exhibit the \" startle reflex, \" turning their heads, opening their mouths, blinking more rapidly, etc. The sound, the researcher tells what to expect, \" wakes up and possibly scares the unborn baby. \" they haven't yet studied what other types of sounds may do this ( alarm clocks, car horns, etc. ) and what decibel level disrupts the baby, but they say they're already planning future studies. ( meanwhile, talking on cellphones while pregnant has been linked to higher rates of misbehavior in those babies later. )",

Those long nights paid off for the photographer when he was named national geographic's travel photographer of the year this week. Tapiro's winning photo shows an erupting colima spewing ash into the starry night sky. A massive lightning bolt leaps between the ash cloud and the volcano. According to quartz, the scientific reason behind the ash cloud's lightning bolt is still up for debate. \"this picture is a gift that nature has given to me, \" tapiro tells nat geo. \"when i saw the camera display i was shocked — i didn't believe it. \" tapiro, who's been taking photos of volcanoes for 15 years, says snapping the winning photograph was one of the most exciting moments of his life. Nat geo selected his photo as this year's winner from more than 15,000 entries from around the world, the telegraph reports. Colima is one of the most active volcanoes in north america, and experts believe it's due for another major eruption — the first since 1913. Tapiro plans to be there to document it when that happens, even building a restaurant in the area to ensure he's nearby. \"it is the passion of my life, \" he tells nat geo. \" i love this volcano. \"",

Terry mcauliffe granted a full pardon to the 58-year-old after a serial rapist who bears a very strong resemblance to mcalister — side-by-side mugshots can be seen here — confessed to the 1986 attempted rape mcalister was convicted of, the washington post reports. Mcalister had already completed his sentence, but he faced indefinite commitment to a mental institution after being deemed at risk of re-offending because he refused to admit his guilt, reports the new york daily news. He was convicted after he was identified from a photo lineup by the victim, who only saw part of her attacker's face when she pulled his mask up. There was no dna linking mcalister to the attempted rape and kidnapping in a richmond, va., apartment complex laundry room. Prosecutors and police voiced doubts about his conviction more than 20 years ago after it emerged that serial rapist norman bruce derr was a suspect in laundry room rapes in the area. Derr, who is already serving five life sentences, confessed under a grant of immunity. Mcalister tells the post he hopes derr \" can deal with his issues as best he can. \" he says he feels sorry for what the victim had to go through. \" it wasn't her fault, and i don't hold any hard feelings at all toward her, \" he tells the post. \" this is what i asked for. To live to see mike out and free, \" his 81-year-old mother told the richmond times-dispatch as he left prison. ( the story of another man wrongly imprisoned for 23 years has a tragic ending. )",

The house speaker says the suit will focus on the president's decision to delay imposing penalties on firms that don't offer health insurance to employees, a change boehner says should have been left to congress, the new york times reports. Obama \" believes he has the power to make his own laws — at times even boasting about it, \" boehner said in a statement yesterday. \" he has said that if congress won't make the laws he wants, he ' ll go ahead and make them himself, and in the case of the employer mandate in his health care law, that's exactly what he did. \" the house \" has an obligation to stand up for the legislative branch, and the constitution, and that is exactly what we will do, \" he said. But legal experts believe boehner has little chance of success, and the proposed lawsuit doesn't seem to be causing many sleepless nights at the white house. Press secretary josh earnest slammed it as a \" political stunt \" yesterday, while obama mocked the proposed lawsuit during a speech in texas. \" you're going to sue me for doing my job? ok. I mean, think about that. You're going to use taxpayer money to sue me for doing my job — while you don't do your job, \" he said as per the hill, which notes that obama addressed the constitutionality of the obamacare penalty delay in a new york times interview last year.

        "summary": "The texas plumber whose truck infamously ended up in the hands of jihdists is suing a car dealership for more than $ 1 million, the houston chronicle reports. At issue: the dealership's failure to remove a decal bearing the name and phone number of the texas city man's business, which he says destroyed his livelihood and resulted in ongoing \" shock, fear, anxiety, mental anguish, humiliation, and degradation \" after a photo of his truck in syria was widely circulated. In the suit filed last week, mark oberholtzer of mark-1 plumbing claims that, as he traded in the 2005 ford f-250 in october 2013, he began to remove the decal, but a salesman said to \" let them handle it. \" the suit traces the pickup's journey from a local auto auction to mersin, turkey. At some point, it entered syria, as evidenced by a photo of the vehicle in aleppo tweeted last december by an ansar al-deen militant. The photo showed the truck, now outfitted with an anti-aircraft weapon, with \" plaintiffs ' logo and phone number … still on the vehicle door, \" the suit says. Further, that photo reached millions of people through social media and tv ( the final episode of the colbert report, for one ). On dec. 17, 2014, the suit says, oberholtzer's business and personal phones received more than 1,000 calls from people who variously yelled expletives, sang in arabic, and made \" threats of injury or death. \" in his suit, oberholtzer alleges that autonation ford gulf freeway admitted to having \" never touched the truck \"; said removing the decal wasn't its responsibility; and hung up on him. Oberholtzer, per courthouse news, continues to get phone threats \" whenever isis commits an atrocity that is reported nationally. \" ( isis somehow keeps getting this particular kind of pickup truck. )",

            "Jerusalem ( reuters ) - president donald trump used his centerpiece holy land speech on tuesday to reaffirm his commitment to peace between israelis and palestinians, but he offered no new details on how to achieve a goal that has eluded u.s. Leaders for decades. Rounding out a 28-hour stay in jerusalem, trump praised israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and palestinian president mahmoud abbas alike, saying both were ready for peace. But he avoided any mention of a palestinian state and did not address a campaign promise to move the u.s. Embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem, something netanyahu yearns for. \"i had a meeting this morning with president abbas and can tell you that the palestinians are ready to reach for peace, \" trump said in a speech at the israel museum in jerusalem. \"in my meeting with my very good friend benjamin, i can tell you also that he is reaching for peace.",

Eleventh-hour polls show romney and rick santorum neck-and-neck in the state. Nate silver is estimating romney will best santorum by the narrowest of margins — 38.7 % to 38 % — but gives him a 55 % chance of winning the state, to santorum's 45 %. Public policy polling, however, declares advantage santorum, 38 % to 37 %, with ron paul and newt gingrich at a distant 14 % and 9 %, respectively. \" it's always good to be cautious with one night poll numbers, but momentum seems to be swinging in santorum's direction, \" notes ppp, which says romney led in sunday interviews, but santorum grabbed a 5-point advantage among people polled on monday. Things are far clearer in arizona, where romney is poised for a cakewalk. He leads santorum 43 % to 26 %, ppp finds, while gingrich stands at 18 %, and paul at 11 %. Romney is winning even among the groups he has struggled with, with leads among tea partiers, \" very conservative \" voters, and evangelicals. Indeed, with so many early votes cast in romney's favor, you could say he has won already, the pollster notes.",
