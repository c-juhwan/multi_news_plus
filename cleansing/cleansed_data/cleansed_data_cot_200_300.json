That's the issue at the heart of a lawsuit godino filed against the network, in which she attempted to force tlc to delay airing the episode of say yes to the dress in which she appears. ( \" not showing the world my gown before the wedding is very important, \" her suit says, per page six. ) but a manhattan judge refused thursday, meaning godino's dress will be unveiled publicly before she walks down the aisle. It all started back in september, when godino, who is from las vegas and getting married in california, was approached at new york's kleinfeld bridal by producers who told her the bride they were supposed to be filming never showed up, and asked her if she was interested in filling in, the new york daily news reports. Godino, 26, says she first made the producers promise they wouldn't air the episode until after her wedding, a promise that her lawyer says was witnessed by her mom and her fiance, professional hockey player jeff may. But godino signed a waiver that included no restrictions about when the show could air, so the judge ruled against her despite acknowledging that airing the episode friday \" could take away from the pageantry of the wedding. \" pageantry indeed: the dress to which godino said yes reportedly cost $ 40,000 and is \" one of the most important aspects of [ her ] entire wedding, \" per the suit. As for her not wanting her fiance to see dress in advance, tmz reports that the judge asked her lawyer if godino could just ask him not to watch the episode. The bride-to-be plans to sue the show for damages.",

        "summary": "President trump tried to fire robert mueller in december, which is the second known time the president has attempted to get rid of the special counsel, according to the new york times. Which cites interviews with eight white house officials and other people close to trump. The sources say trump demanded the firing because he was enraged by media reports that mueller had crossed his \" red line \" and subpoenaed deutsche bank seeking records on the financial dealings of the trump family. The insiders say that trump backed down after lawyers contacted mueller's team and determined that the reports were what the president would describe as \" fake news. \" the times reported earlier this year that the chief white house lawyer refused trump's order to fire mueller last june. The times report heightened worries that trump will fire mueller out of anger at monday's raid on the offices of michael cohen, his personal lawyer. After the raid — the result of an investigation mueller passed to the manhattan us attorney — trump said it was a \" disgrace \" and told reporters he hadn't made up his mind yet about firing mueller, cnn reports. Republicans, who fear firing mueller could cause chaos, have been trying to talk him down, though senate majority leader mitch mcconnell say he doesn't see a need to pass legislation to protect him from being removed, the hill reports. \" i don't think that's going to happen, and that remains my view, \" mcconnell said tuesday. \" it's still my view that mueller should be allowed to finish his job. I think that's the view of most people in congress. \"",

If that isn't attention-grabbing enough, consider that the animal prompted a biologist to talk like this: \" these turtles breathe out of their ass, which is super awesome. \" that's james cook university researcher jason schaffer, who's spent eight years studying the turtles in a habitat where dams, agriculture, and predation are making it increasingly difficult for them to survive, reports scientific american. One of australia's largest freshwater turtle species — which can live to be 100 — white-throated snapping turtles do indeed possess an unusual skill: cloacal respiration, by which they extract oxygen from water via their backsides, reports james cook university. Thanks to dams, though, water is becoming too sluggish for this kind of breathing, bringing the reptiles to the surface, where they're vulnerable to predators, and restricting them from traveling to find mates. And their eggs take seven months to hatch, which is plenty of time to be eaten or trampled. \" almost nothing is surviving, \" schaffer says. \" there is nothing coming up to replace them. Pretty soon we ' ll blink and there will be no more left. \" ( it turns out turtle shells predate dinosaurs. )",

If the account is verified — and it was apparently documented on video — it would best the previous longest kill made by a british sniper in 2009 of 2,475 meters. The gunman used a mcmillan tac-50, which newsweek notes is the standard rifle among canada's well-regarded snipers, and took the shot from a high-rise building in an unspecified locale in iraq. The globe and mail spoke to multiple military sources who knew about the shot. \"it is at the distance where you have to account not just for the ballistics of the round, which change over time and distance, you have to adjust for wind, and the wind would be swirling, \" one expert tells the globe and mail. In fact, at that distance, the shooter would also have to account for the curvature of the earth, he adds.

A member of canada's joint task force 2 — part of the u.s.-led coalition that is taking the fight to isis in iraq — made the kill during an operation that took place within the last month in iraq, sources told the globe and mail. The identity of the sniper and his observer was kept anonymous for operational security reasons. The sniper used a mcmillan tac-50 sniper rifle — the standard long-range sniper of the canadian military — and fired the shot from a high-rise building in an undisclosed location.

One employee tells wsoc that the room \" erupted in emotion, \" with people \" crying \" and \" yelling, \" partly because a deputy on staff had recently been lost to suicide. After the meeting, the ems workers banded together with other ems workers across the state, as well as local firefighters and retired law enforcement members, to protest bronson's words. Per wis, the head of an ems crisis management group called bronson's remarks \" absolutely appalling, \" \" insensitive, \" \" unprofessional, \" and \" childish, \" especially to a group of workers \" who deal with death and crisis situations every day. \" per quorum columbia, bronson tried to apologize friday in an email, noting he'd lost someone close to him to suicide, but he submitted his resignation monday, acknowledging the \" horrible and terrible thing \" he'd said.

That opinion, handed down in a pair of decisions thursday, covers more than 200 inmates awaiting execution — and includes all of those who were sentenced after 2002 or whose appeals were not final by that year. It is a legal decision that death row inmates, defense attorneys, prosecutors and the families of murder victims have awaited since january, when the u.s. Supreme court found the state's death penalty unconstitutional. Id photos of central florida convicted killers on florida death row. ( florida department of corrections ) ( florida department of corrections ) that ruling made it clear that florida needed to rework its death penalty statute to bring it in line with other states that handled those cases, specifically by requiring that juries — not judges — make the key findings required to impose a death sentence.

            "Death penalty opponents demonstrating against an execution in florida in 2014. ( matt mcclain/the washington post ) the florida supreme court said thursday that some death-row prisoners there may be able to seek new sentences, a decision that could impact hundreds of inmates and ends months of uncertainty surrounding capital punishment in one of the country's leading death penalty states. While the court's ruling means that many inmates could potentially avoid execution, many others on the state's death row — the second-largest in the country, trailing only california — were deemed ineligible for this resentencing in a separate ruling thursday. The decisions thursday, along with doubt that has suffused florida's death penalty for most of this year, stemmed from a u.s. Supreme court ruling in january striking down the state's death sentencing scheme as unconstitutional.

            "The florida supreme court on thursday ruled that the state's death penalty was so flawed for so long that more than half of the people on death row may be entitled to new sentencing hearings. That opinion, handed down in a pair of decisions thursday, covers more than 200 inmates awaiting execution — and includes all of those who were sentenced after 2002 or whose appeals were not final by that year. It is a legal decision that death row inmates, defense attorneys, prosecutors and the families of murder victims have awaited since january, when the u.s. Supreme court found the state's death penalty unconstitutional. Id photos of central florida convicted killers on florida death row. ( florida department of corrections ) ( florida department of corrections ) that ruling made it clear that florida needed to rework its death penalty statute to bring it in line with other states that handled those cases, specifically by requiring that juries — not judges — make the key findings required to impose a death sentence.

( matt mcclain/the washington post ) the florida supreme court said thursday that some death-row prisoners there may be able to seek new sentences, a decision that could impact hundreds of inmates and ends months of uncertainty surrounding capital punishment in one of the country's leading death penalty states. While the court's ruling means that many inmates could potentially avoid execution, many others on the state's death row — the second-largest in the country, trailing only california — were deemed ineligible for this resentencing in a separate ruling thursday. The decisions thursday, along with doubt that has suffused florida's death penalty for most of this year, stemmed from a u.s. Supreme court ruling in january striking down the state's death sentencing scheme as unconstitutional.

That's what researchers are saying about four skeletons from the 17th and 18th centuries found buried with iron sickles around their necks in a polish cemetery, discovery reports. Writing in antiquity, marek polcyn and elzbieta gajda say the skeletons — two adult females, an adult male, and an adolescent female excavated with over 250 human remains starting in 2008 — may have been feared as possible demons in drawsko, northwestern poland. The sickles \" may have been a measure to prevent the demonized soul threatening the living, or could have been a reference to biblical symbolism in an attempt to prevent the soul from becoming demonized, \" the authors write. They dismiss the theory that the villagers feared vampirism, saying the burials were conventionally christian, with heads pointing west, and the graves don't seem desecrated. Perhaps the burials followed the folk belief that a person with a \" bad death \" ( like drowning, suicide, or death during childbirth ) was prone to being inhabited by one of fourteen demons. Such beliefs persisted alongside slavic pagan faith and christianity in poland at the time, live science reports. Interestingly, a fifth skeleton had the sickle around her hips, a stone at her neck, and a coin in her mouth. \" coins were placed in the mouth to favor the deceased's passage into the afterlife, \" one expert says. \" the sickle and the stone would have prevent[ ed ] the dead from returning. \" ( read about self-identified vampires who have \" a real fear. \" )",

The republican majority in the senate would go down to 51-49, which leaves democrats a much more likely path to flipping things in 2018. To get control of the senate, they'd need to keep all their vulnerable seats and add arizona and nevada, where nbc estimates they have at least a 50 % chance of victory. And even before the 2018 elections, the gop tax plan could be in trouble — the slimmer republicans ' margin of control in the senate, the harder they have to work to get senators like rand paul, bob corker, and susan collins on board since they can only afford to lose one gop vote. For now, it doesn't seem moore — accused of molesting a 14-year-old when he was 32, among other things — is planning to withdraw so another republican can run in his place; it's unclear whether he'd even be able to withdraw at this late date. Alabama's state auditor defended moore thursday by comparing his situation to that of mary and joseph, a biblical couple with a big age difference who \" became parents of jesus. \" in the washington post, aaron blake calls jim zeigler's words \" the worst defense \" of moore so far. If moore did what he's accused of, it was illegal, hands down — not just \" unusual \" as zeigler calls it. Blake notes that evangelical leaders are also slamming zeigler's remarks. Another jesus comparison: roy moore's brother says the politician is being persecuted like christ was, cnn reports. Jerry moore also said he's very concerned about the effect all this will have on their 91-year-old mother.",

She was delivered just before midnight on sunday amid an explosion of press camera flashes at manila's jose fabella memorial hospital. \" she looks so lovely, \" her mother, camille dalura, whispered softly as she cradled her tiny newborn. \" i can't believe she is the world's seven billionth. \" danica's name means morning star.

The parents and the baby were met by officials from the un, which named 31 october seven billion day, aiming to draw attention to the challenges of the world's growing population.

The move comes after more than 500,000 people in the uk signed a petition calling for the ban because of trump's idea to temporarily ban muslims from coming to the us. No vote will follow the debate, reports reuters, making this more an airing of views. Interior minister theresa may is the only one who can issue such a ban, and the guardian reports that it doesn't look likely. Still, it should be lively. \" what i will be doing today is asking that theresa may exercise constancy in her approach to people who preach hatred, \" says scottish national party lawmaker tasmina ahmed-sheikh. But labour lawmaker paul flynn think it's misguided — not that he sounds like a trump fan. \" sadly a ban would perversely help him in america, and that is where opinion matters, \" he says. \" it would probably give him a halo of victimhood as a martyr and perversely that will attract more support for him. \" no tweets so far from trump about monday's debate, though he has previously threatened to yank $ 1 billion in investments in golf courses in scotland if he is banned. The bbc has a q&a on the controversy, and it's aimed squarely at uk readers, given the very first question: \" who is donald trump? \"",

The way things are going, the terror group soon won't qualify as an official adversary of the military, the pentagon's top lawyer said in a speech at london's oxford university last night, reports the guardian. Two key points by jeh johnson, who, incidentally, is thought to be a top contender for attorney general when eric holder steps down in about a year: \" i do believe that on the present course there will come a tipping point, a tipping point at which so many of the leaders and operatives of al-qaeda and its affiliates have been killed or captured, and the group is no longer able to attempt or launch a strategic attack against the united states, such that al-qaeda as we know it, the organization that our congress authorized the military to pursue in 2001, has been effectively destroyed. \" \" at that point we must be able to say to ourselves that our efforts should no longer be considered an armed conflict against al-qaeda and its associated forces, rather a counter-terrorism effort against individuals who are the scattered remains of al-qaeda … for which the law enforcement and intelligence resources of our government are principally responsible. \" the military would play a more limited role, stepping in when necessary. The speech is part of the administration's long-range efforts to clarify its counterterror rules, explains the wall street journal, which susses out a tangible possibility: remaining detainees at gitmo are held under the 2001 authority for the use of military force against al-qaeda. If that decree is no longer in effect a few years down the road, it presents an avenue for the release of prisoners and closure of the detention facility.",

The two receiving this most attention: this: \" the appointment of the special councel [ sic ] is totally unconstitutional! despite that, we play the game because i, unlike the democrats, have done nothing wrong! \" and this: \" as has been stated by numerous legal scholars, i have the absolute right to pardon myself, but why would i do that when i have done nothing wrong? in the meantime, the never ending witch hunt, led by 13 very angry and conflicted democrats ( &amp; others ) continues into the mid-terms! \" regarding the constitutionality of the mueller probe, the american prospect tackled that very subject in a may 30 piece, detailing at length why \" the special counsel's work is firmly grounded in precedent. \" it's in part a counter-opinion to a may 13 wall street journal op-ed written by federalist society chair steven calabresi that asserted the probe \" crosses the legal line. \" as for the issue of whether trump could pardon himself, it was a hot topic this weekend following a nyt report on a 20-page letter written by trump's lawyers that touched on the subject; rudy giuliani addressed it too. Cnbc chimes in, citing a justice department memo written in advance of president richard nixon's 1974 resignation, the first line of which reads, \" under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the president cannot pardon himself. \"",

        "summary": "The hand is a bit smaller than that of an adult and made from roughly a pound of bronze. What it was used for has perplexed archaeologists since it was found in switzerland last october. At an estimated 3,500 years old, national geographic calls it \" europe's earliest metal body part \" — though it subsequently narrows that to \" the earliest metal representation \" of one. As gizmodo explains, archaeologists don't believe someone wore the hand but, rather, that an internal socket allowed it to be affixed atop a stick or pole. It was unearthed by metal detector-armed treasure hunters searching around lake biel in what archaeologists later discovered was a grave in extreme disrepair. It held the bones of a middle-aged man, along with items that included a bronze pin and one of the bronze hand's fingers. Because the hand was taken from the scene in a less-than-scientific way, any knowledge that could be gleaned about its use based on how it might have been arranged with the buried man's body has been lost to history. That's left andrea schaer of the bern archaeological service with only speculations: \" it must have been placed on something, but we don't know what \" — national geographic suggests \" it could have adorned a statue, been mounted on a stick and wielded like a scepter, or even worn as a prosthetic as part of a ritual. \" a press release notes \" its gold ornament suggests that it is an emblem of power, a distinctive sign of the social elite, even of a deity. \" gizmodo reports on a weird twist: a criminal investigation is underway based on authorities ' belief that some items may have been stolen from the grave.

        "summary": "It's quite the fanciful story: nazis buried diamonds and 100 gold bars in a bavarian town during world war ii, in a spot whose location was encoded into an annotated piece of sheet music by adolf hitler's private secretary. That score, to gottfried federlein's \" march impromptu, \" was posted online in december by stumped dutch journalist karl hammer, reports der spiegel. Now, a 51-year-old fellow dutchman who spent nine months poring over what nbc news describes as \" letters, figures, and lyrics \" added to the score thinks he has an answer — or, at least, a \" very good theory. \" leon giesen spotted a distinct capital \" m, \" which seemed familiar to him: an image of a berlin train station had contained the same letter. He now believes the \" m \" stands for mittenwald, where nazi barracks once stood, and that the phrase enden der tanz, or \" end the dance, \" refers to one of the rail line's buffer stops, reports the guardian. If you're doubtful, there's also this: giesen thinks an added lyric ( wo matthias die saiten streichelt, \" where matthew plucks strings \" ) refers to 17th-century violin builder matthias klotz, who hailed from that same town. Giesen got the go-ahead to drill three holes in mittenwald, and says his \" geophysical survey \" revealed an \" anomaly \" in the earth. Next up: raise more money for a full excavation, which is no small task. \" if there are boxes with valuable items below the surface they could be booby-trapped, so we need to bring in specialists and meet all safety requirements first. \" ( more treasure-related news: jewels have been found atop the french alps. )",

The news appears to have originated from ria novosti, a state-run news agency, which ran the following quote from an unnamed source with no affiliation: \" yesterday, our scientists stopped drilling at the depth of 3,768 meters [ 12,362 feet ] and reached the surface of the sub-glacial lake. \" the same news report went on to discuss an old theory that nazis built a secret base at lake vostok in the 1930s, and that german submarines brought hitler and eva braun's remains to antarctica for cloning purposes following the german surrender in world war ii. \" there are a lot of rumors going around about penetrating the lake, and we need the russian program to make the official announcement, \" said john priscu, a university of montana microbiologist and veteran antarctic researcher who has been involved in lake vostok investigations for years \" if they were successful, their efforts will transform the way we do science in antarctica and provide us with an entirely new view of what exists under"

        "summary": "Sons inherit a baldness gene from their moms, and now scientists are pointing to another parent-child link on the opposite side. Per the bbc, fathers can pass down a gene mutation to their daughters that can raise the risk of ovarian cancer, per a study published thursday in plos genetics. The 30-year study of nearly 3,500 grandmother/granddaughter pairs culled from the familial ovarian cancer registry found that women had a spiked risk of ovarian cancer if their grandmothers on their fathers'side had had the disease. The mutation, which was found to be distinct from the brca1 and brca2 mutations that are inherited from both parents, was also tied to a higher rate of prostate cancer in both the fathers and their sons, per news.com.au. To work out their experiment, researchers pulled 186 women with ovarian cancer and sequenced their x chromosomes. What they found was women whose paternal grandmothers suffered from the disease had double the risk of developing the cancer than those whose maternal grandmothers had had it. Daughters get a total of one x chromosome from their dads, and on that chromosome is where the possibly mutated magec3 gene lies. Women can receive the gene from their moms as well — but since their fathers are only giving them one x chromosome, if the gene is mutated, the daughters are sure to receive it, per newsweek. Women with this mutated gene also seemed to get ovarian cancer nearly seven years earlier than they would have without the mutated gene. That means if sisters within one family get ovarian cancer, all paths may lead back to dad. \" a family with three daughters who all have ovarian cancer is more likely to be driven by inherited x mutations than by brca mutations, \" study co-author kevin eng says. ( scientists hope a blood test may one day catch ovarian cancer early. )",

The zillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich, available at the restaurant at 160 e. Pearson st, is made with artisanal sourdough bread coated with laudemio marchesi de ' frescobaldi extra-virgin olive oil, which retails for more than $ 30 a bottle. Layered inside the sandwich is thinly-sliced black iberco ham from free-roaming, acorn-fed pigs raised in the south of spain. The meat is salted and air-dried for six weeks, then cured for a minimum of 12 months — usually closer to 18 months, said eric ciechna, a host at the restaurant. \" up until a few years ago, you could not get iberco ham in the united states, \" ciechna said. \" it's so insanely expensive. We get it in very small quantities. \" most important is the cheese: a 40-year-old aged wisconsin cheddar infused with 24-carat gold flakes. Other ingredients include heirloom tomatoes from the ellis family farm in benton"

Instead, his holiness — or @franciscus, as he's now known on instagram — posted a picture of himself praying along with the phrase \" pray for me \" in nine languages. Cnn reports the pope had 100,000 instagram followers within an hour of launching his account. His first post had more than 65,000 likes and nearly 12,000 comments in the first three hours. Instagram ceo kevin systrom, who met with the pope last month, called the pope's first instagram post \" an incredible moment \" and said his \" messages of humility, compassion and mercy will leave a lasting mark, \" according to time. A vatican spokesperson says the pope joining instagram is a \" particularly smart move \" because it's quickly becoming more popular in catholic-heavy countries like italy, mexico, and brazil. Pope francis has embraced social media during his three years in the position. He actually announced his first instagram post on twitter, were he has nearly 9 million followers. \" i am beginning a new journey, on instagram, to walk with you along the path of mercy and the tenderness of god, \" the pope tweeted. But for anyone worried the pope will soon be too distracted by filter options to get any work done, cnn points out someone else does his social media for him.",

            "Trending look but don't touch! american tourist snaps italian statue's finger off aug. 6, 2013 at 6: 31 pm et violating the first rule of visiting a museum — look but don't touch the art — an american tourist in italy has generated shock and outrage by snapping the finger off a 600-year-old statue at a museum in florence. According to the italian newspaper, corriere fiorentino, the snap heard around the art world took place when an unnamed 55-year-old missouri man visiting the city's museo dell ' opera del duomo held his hand up against the outstretched palm of a statue of the virgin mary by the 15th-century sculptor giovanni d ' ambrogio. Whether he was comparing hand spans or giving the statue a high five is unclear but the end result was that the pinky finger of the statue's right hand was broken off.

The two died after a brief altercation that took place at about 6: 25 p.m., pedri said at a news conference late monday night. Pedri identified the inmate as timothy gilliam, 27. Pedri said he believed gilliam had been incarcerated for failing to register under megan's law, for sex offenders. Pedri said the name of the prison guard was not being released at the request of his family. \"this guard went to work today believing that he would be coming home, \" pedri said. \"and, sadly that didn't happen. \" he called the incident a \"sad and tragic. \" \"we will do everything in our power to ensure an incident like this never happens again, \" he said.

When asked about mark rockovich, the new correctional division head, pedri said monday was his first day on the job. Luzerne county councilman tim mcginley, who was on site shortly after the incident occurred, said any suspect death would be of concern to the county, noting that the county spends $ 30 million on the facility annually. Michele rohrbaugh, whose son michael is an inmate on the fifth floor of the facility, came for a visit at about 7 p.m. And was told by prison staff that there would be no visit because the prison was on lockdown.

The drone was recording the event from about 20 feet in the air when the man emerged from a crowd, took aim, and let fly, sending the drone careening to the ground, per inverse. Its operators, photographers from lipetsk, say the drone had to be sent to moscow for repairs, reports the guardian. Luckily its footage of sword fights and half-naked rugby games was unharmed.",

Maduro vowed to resist what he called the \"neo-fascist madness \" of his foreign foes and called on the international community to denounce the alleged plot against him. \"our message to the world is: it's time to defend venezuela! \" he said. \"venezuela will not be a victim of a neo-fascist aggression. \" \"we will not retreat, we will not be brought to our knees, we will not give up. We will fight and we will guarantee venezuela peace … whatever the price, \" maduro added. \"we don't want violence, or international conflicts, or war, or coups. No, no, no, no. The people want progress, prosperity and coexistence. \" bolton praises bolsonaro while declaring 'troika of tyranny ' in latin america read more venezuela's president also lashed out at brazil's incoming president, jair bolsonaro, and his vice-president, hamilton mourão, who he claimed was obsessed with the idea of invading venezuela. \"[ this guy ] has the face",

Experts say the city of 4 million is overdue for a big earthquake. But \" it's easy to forget when the ground is still, \" garza writes. \" this was a sobering and graphic reminder. \" garza was especially moved by videos showing whole buildings crumbling to dust or families huddled together as their house shakes.

        "summary": "There's a little green leaf that relieves pain and helps people kick heroin, but is also addictive — so should it be legal? that's what lawmakers are trying to decide about kratom, a tree-like plant from southeast asia, the new york times reports. The fda has banned kratom imports while four states ( wyoming, vermont, tennessee, and indiana ) have made it illegal, but more kratom bars are emerging that serve the leaf in drink form, and powdered versions are available online and everywhere from convenience stores to gas stations. \" it's a mind-altering substance, so people like me who are addicts and alcoholics, they think just because it's legal, it's fine, \" says florida resident dariya pankova, who took kratom for heroin withdrawal. \" it's a huge epidemic down here, and it's causing a lot of relapses. \" long taken as a stimulant in countries such as thailand, indonesia, and malaysia, kratom contains something called mitragynine that seems to cause \" opiod-like effects, \" per medscape. But kratom also has been linked to respiratory depression, seizures, and possibly suicide; makers of the herbal-liquid \" feel good \" supplement vivazen recently removed kratom from its ingredients, bevnet reports. Yet advocates like the american kratom association say the leaf helps wean people off dangerous drugs, and reason argues that states ' arguments against kratom ( that it's an opioid or synthetic drug ) are incorrect. \" it all boils down to the interpretation of the law, \" says a drug official in alabama, where one county banned all kratom products last month, abc 3340 reports. \" my district attorney interprets it [ as ] illegal because it hits the opiate receptor of the brain. \" ( one country may give heroin addicts what they want: heroin. )",

( they were found on the computer of anthony weiner, husband of clinton aide huma abedin, during a separate investigation of him. ) some of the latest developments: the justice department and the fbi is seeking a warrant to conduct a full search of the abedin emails, but the issue is tricky because the computer belongs to weiner, not abedin, explains cnn. The subpoena under which it was seized relates only to the allegations that he was sexting with an underage girl. When the search begins, it will take weeks because the laptop has a total of about 650,000 emails. It's not clear how many of those were sent to or from clinton's private server, but that figure is probably in the \" thousands, \" reports the wall street journal. Some may be duplicates that already have been seen by the fbi. Meanwhile, talks also are under way with abedin's lawyers to gain access to the emails, reports usa today. Abedin has told people she has no idea how her emails ended up on her husband's computer, reports the washington post. Her lawyers didn't search it when they were turning over her emails to the state department, because she was reportedly unaware they were on it. A separate post story says fbi agents had known for weeks about the emails on weiner's computer but delayed telling fbi chief james comey for reasons that are unclear. The chief white house ethics lawyer in the george w. Bush administration thinks the fbi's comey has run afoul of the hatch act, which bars the use of an official position to sway an election. Richard painter filed a formal complaint with the office of special counsel, and he explains his case in the new york times.

That he was there was a reflection of just how \" yellow \" he was, per the letter, as he didn't try to flee as he was captured. The dallas morning news reports the trio had a falling out over hamilton's girlfriend ( the \" prostitute sweetheart \" the letter refers to ); the ap cites a disagreement over how to divvy up $ 4,000 they had taken from a texas bank earlier that year.

The lines are biting. \" i should have killed you then i would have saved myself much bother and money looking for you, \" reads the letter, which boston-based rr auction says was likely dictated by barrow to parker, who had superior writing skills. It closes by telling hamilton, \" i hope this will serve the purpose of letting you know that you can never expect the least of sympathy or assistance from me. So long. \" but he may not have ever seen it. Sheriff richard \" smoot \" schmid intercepted it and later publicized it; his family is now auctioning it off.

        "summary": "Job-stealing robots should be taxed the same as humans, bill gates says. \" if a robot comes in to do the same thing, you'd think that we'd tax the robot at a similar level, \" the microsoft founder tells quartz. He says governments should tax companies that replace workers with machines and use that money to fund jobs that can only be performed by humans, such as caring for children and the elderly. In what is perhaps a surprising declaration for a man who built his fortune through innovation, the billionaire philanthropist contends the pace of automation in job-killing industries ought to be slowed, and taxes can help do that. \" it is really bad if people overall have more fear about what innovation is going to do than they have enthusiasm, \" he says. While the european parliament last week nixed a robot tax for now, notes the telegraph, such a levy is being pushed by the french socialist candidate for president. But the idea of taxing machines is picking up steam even in the unlikely climes of silicon valley, which seems to favor the customers, not the industry, footing the bill, per the financial times. But the world's richest man doesn't think manufacturers would mind paying up. \" i don't think the robot companies are going to be outraged that there might be a tax, \" he says. \" it's ok. \" skeptics took to twitter, blaming microsoft's own technology for lost human jobs.

Known as the \" queen of curves \" for her \" signature flowing style, \" business insider notes, she was the only female architect to ascend to the ranks of what quartz labels as her profession's elite \" starchitects \" group. The iraqi-born brit was known for her designs for, among others, the london aquatic center ( a 2012 olympics venue ), china's guangzhou opera house, and cincinnati's rosenthal center for contemporary art.

The times points out that hadid's designs were often not the most practical ( nor the cheapest ): her plans for the 2020 olympics ' main venue in tokyo had to be ditched after anticipated costs blew up to around $ 2.5 billion, more than double the original estimate. But she came up during a time when architects morphed into celebrities, and she was one of the hottest and most imaginative of them all, cranking out such complicated theoretical designs in the beginning of her career that they were never able to be brought to fruition. \" each new project is more audacious than the last and the sources of her originality seem endless, \" the pritzker jury wrote upon awarding her its prize in 2004.

        "summary": "The co-founders of the dating app tinder, along with eight other current and former executives, filed a lawsuit tuesday against iac/interactivecorp and its match group subsidiary for allegedly bilking them by manipulating financial information to create a lowball estimate of tinder's value, the ap reports. They are seeking at least $ 2 billion in the lawsuit against match and iac, which is controlled by media mogul barry diller. Iac and match group, of which tinder is now part, called the allegations in the lawsuit \" meritless. \" the lawsuit claims that there were written contracts between iac and match and tinder employees, including founders sean rad, justin mateen, and jonathan badeen. The contracts required tinder be valued on specific dates in 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021 and that the workers be allowed to exercise their stock options and sell them to iac and match. The lawsuit alleges new york-based iac and match instead created false financial information, delayed new products, and used other tactics to try to keep tinder's valuation low. Per cnn, the dispute centers around a 2017 analysis that valued tinder at $ 3 billion, the same valuation that had been set two years prior, despite the fact that both revenue and subscribers had increased in that time; the suit says the 2017 valuation, which was done to set a value for stock options received by rad and other early employees, should have been higher. Tinder was then merged into match group, which the lawsuit says was a pretext to extinguish tinder employees'stock options. \" they lied about the financial performance. They manipulated financial data, and essentially stole billions of dollars by not paying us what they contractually owe us, \" rad tells cnn. In a statement, iac and match group said rad, mateen, and other former execs \" may not like the fact that tinder has experienced enormous success following their respective departures, but sour grapes alone do not a lawsuit make. \" see cnn for much more on the ins and outs of the suit, which also includes allegations of sexual harassment and groping against tinder's former ceo.",

Usually, the stronger lobsters are usually the reddish brown color but this one still had a hard shell. \" ward gave the lobster to seacoast science center in rye to examine and put on display. According to aquarist rob royer, the likelihood of a catching a blue lobster is somewhere between 1 and 3 million. He said the odds of catching an albino lobster are roughly one in a hundred million. \"blue lobsters are still pretty uncommon, \" royer said. \" we ' ll get about five or six calls every summer. Every time we get a call about an albino lobster, i get a little skeptical just because they are so rare. \" royer said ward's lobster will eventually go on display in seacoast science center's \"exotic \" lobster tank as soon"

He said people are \" always asking about how women \" would do playing against him. In a joking re-ranking of history's greatest tennis players, mcenroe put williams fifth overall, asking, \" you happy now? \" he said he would rank about 1,200th out of women's tennis players at his current age of 58, usa today reports.

This time, she was grilling marines chief gen. Robert neller in the wake of the revelation that photos and videos of female marines, sometimes nude, had been widely shared in online groups. One exchange, via abc news, sums it up: gillibrand: \" it is a serious problem when we have members of our military denigrating female marines who will give their life to this country in the way they have, with no response from leadership. So if you're dedicated to fixing the culture of the marines and all the services, what do you plan to do to hold commanders responsible who fail to get this done? \" neller: \" i ' m responsible. I ' m the commandant. I own this, and we are going to have to, you know, you've heard it before, but we're going to have to change how we see ourselves and how we do — how we treat each other. That's a lame answer, but ma ' am, that's the best i can tell you right now. We've got to change, and that's on me. \" the new york times, meanwhile, has the story of one of the women victimized. Savannah cunningham, a 19-year-old in phoenix, made a nude video for a marine she was dating in a long-distance relationship, and it surfaced in the online forums. Cunningham wasn't in the military at the time, but, despite the harassment she endured over the video, ships out for basic training next month. \"someone needs to stand up and say this does not represent the values of the marine corps, \" she tells the newspaper. \"if not me, then who? \" a story in the navy times shows the challenge: it confirms that the scandal is not confined to the marines, with women from at least a dozen navy commands also specifically targeted in the online forums, likely by other sailors.",

In fact, researchers now say that people steeped in social isolation ( including those who live by themselves ) and a lack of connection with others can suffer just as much of a mortality risk as someone inhaling nearly a pack of cigarettes a day, and even more so than someone who's obese, seeker reports. All of which leads julianne holt-lunstad — a brigham young university psychology professor who presented these findings, also published in the plos one journal, at the american psychological association's convention on saturday in dc — to stress that loneliness and isolation should be treated as public health issues. She says they could perhaps be partly remedied via initiatives such as teaching kids more social skills in school, or prepping seniors on how to keep their social lives active after they retire. Holt-lunstad's research was based on two meta-analyses. The first, comprised of 148 studies and nearly 300,000 subjects, found those who claimed better social connections also boasted a 50 % lower risk of early demise — and poor social connectivity offered the same mortality risk as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. The second grouping was made up of more than 3.4 million participants over 70 studies and found that social isolation ( lack of actual contact with others ), loneliness ( the perception of feeling lonely, whether others are around or not ), or simply living alone all carried more risk of premature death than obesity. \" with an increasing aging population, the effect on public health is only anticipated to increase, \" holt-lunstad notes. \" indeed, many nations around the world now suggest we are facing a ' loneliness epidemic.'the challenge...

Extreme examples show infants in custodial care who lack human contact fail to thrive and often die, and indeed, social isolation or solitary confinement has been used as a form of punishment, \" said julianne holt-lunstad, phd, professor of psychology at brigham young university. \"yet an increasing portion of the u.s. Population now experiences isolation regularly. \" approximately 42.6 million adults over age 45 in the united states are estimated to be suffering from chronic loneliness, according to aarp's loneliness study. In addition, the most recent u.s. Census data shows more than a quarter of the population lives alone, more than half of the population is unmarried and, since the previous census, marriage rates and the number of children per household have declined. \"these trends suggest that americans are becoming less socially connected and experiencing more loneliness, \" said holt-lunstad.

            "Washington — loneliness and social isolation may represent a greater public health hazard than obesity, and their impact has been growing and will continue to grow, according to research presented at the 125th annual convention of the american psychological association. \"being connected to others socially is widely considered a fundamental human need — crucial to both well-being and survival. Extreme examples show infants in custodial care who lack human contact fail to thrive and often die, and indeed, social isolation or solitary confinement has been used as a form of punishment, \" said julianne holt-lunstad, phd, professor of psychology at brigham young university. \"yet an increasing portion of the u.s. Population now experiences isolation regularly. \" approximately 42.6 million adults over age 45 in the united states are estimated to be suffering from chronic loneliness, according to aarp's loneliness study. In addition, the most recent u.s. Census data shows more than a quarter of the population lives alone, more than half of the population is unmarried and, since the previous census, marriage rates and the number of children per household have declined. \"these trends suggest that americans are becoming less socially connected and experiencing more loneliness, \" said holt-lunstad.

        "summary": "A huge manhunt is underway in spain for the driver of a van that plowed into pedestrians in barcelona, killing 14 people in a terrorist attack claimed by isis. Spanish police have named the suspect as 18-year-old moussa oukabir, the guardian reports. The suspect's brother, 28-year-old moroccan national driss oukabir, was arrested after the attack and reportedly told authorities that his identity documents, which were used to rent the van, were stolen. In other developments: police say five suspects shot dead after injuring people in a second attack thursday night were wearing fake explosive belts, cnn reports. The suspects engaged in a shootout with police after driving their audi a3 into pedestrians in the town of cambrils, authorities say. Their vehicle overturned during the attack. The suicide belts were so realistic that security forces didn't know they were fake until controlled explosions had been carried out, authorities say. Investigators believe a 12-person terror cell was behind both attacks and an explosion that killed a person at a house in the town of alcanar, the telegraph reports. They suspect the terrorists were planning to use gas canisters in another attack. A counterterrorism expert tell the new york times that authorities believe the attackers initially planned to use a large truck loaded with explosives, but they rented multiple smaller vehicles after they couldn't get a permit for a larger one. Police say the three people arrested so far include a man from melilla, spain's north african enclave, reports reuters. A 7-year-old australian boy is missing after the barcelona attack, the guardian reports. Family members are pleading for help in the search for julian cadman, whose mother was hospitalized in serious condition after the attack. Spanish prime minister mariano rajoy said spaniards \" are not just united in mourning, but especially in the firm determination to beat those who want to rob us of our values and our way of life, \" the ap reports. He has declared three days of national mourning. This is the latest atrocity in what the bbc calls a \" worrying trend \" of attackers using vehicles to attack \" soft \" targets. Isis has claimed responsibility for the attack, though it's not clear whether the attackers are directly linked to the group or only inspired by them. ( the victims, including more than 100 injured, came from at least 24 countries. )",

He could see the flag-wrapped coffin, the six white horses pulling the caisson, the endless line of black automobiles bearing the world's dignitaries. He could hear the cadence of the muffled drums. It was nov. 25, 1963. Clark, 36, the army bugler assigned to sound taps at the funeral, had been waiting in the cold for hours. A perfectionist and superb musician, he had just played taps for the president on veterans day two weeks earlier. Now he had the most important and solitary task of his life: sound the 24 notes of the venerable melody that would close the nation's wrenching, four-day farewell to its assassinated president. But the pressure, the cold and the wait told on sgt. Clark that day 50 years ago this month. A lone, flubbed note played by keith clark, the bugler at president john f.

The unnamed victim says erlis chaisson, a family member, started sexually abusing her in the mid- ' 90s when she was 8 years old. According to kxxv, chaisson had already been convicted of molesting another 8-year-old girl a few years earlier. In 2014, the victim contacted chaisson and told him she was going to counseling and wanted to talk about the abuse, the waco tribune reports. Chaisson agreed to meet. He didn't know she was a texas police officer, and he also didn't know she was wearing a wire. Chaisson would confess six times over the first 90 minutes of their conversation. Prosecutors say chaisson was shockingly forthcoming in his conversation with the victim, which was played in its entirety for jurors. He accused the victim of \" trying to put all the blame on me \" while simultaneously blaming her for wanting the abuse. He also blamed his own genitals. \" the d --- has no conscience, \" the daily beast quotes chaisson as saying on the recording. \" if you had a penis, you would know. \" the victim says her \" heart was racing \" during chaisson's confession. \" he was talking like he was talking to his best friend, \" she says. Because it wasn't his first such offense, a jury sentenced the 47-year-old chaisson to life in prison last month. ( hundreds of doctors keep practicing after sexually abusing patients. )",

It was 5 p.m. On a warm september 2014 day in granbury, texas, and the 25-year-old woman had asked chaisson to meet to talk about the years of sexual abuse he inflicted upon her beginning at age 8. \"are you sorry that you did it? \" she asked him. \"i mean, i understand you're — you're putting, trying to put all the blame on me, \" chaisson said, over the sound of water splashing from a nearby fountain. \"lines got crossed.

A major study commissioned by the us government found that diplomats suffered concussion-like symptoms, and many of them reported hearing strange noises before falling ill. Now, however, four separate letters by scientists in the us and several other nations are challenging that initial study, which was conducted by researchers at the university of pennsylvania, reports the guardian.

Highlights: psychological? robert bartholomew, a us scientist who works in new zealand, makes the case for a \" mass psychogenic illness, \" also known as mass hysteria, reports buzzfeed. The cuban illnesses have all the hallmarks, he says, and he faults the penn researchers for not investigating how closely the victims knew each other, and perhaps fed off each other in terms of symptoms. Inner ear: another critic faults the first study for not focusing more on potential inner ear trouble. \" almost all of the patients complained of hearing loss and balance problems, \" writes gerard gianoli of louisana's ear and balance institute. \"i do wish they would be more thoroughly evaluated. \" cognitive results: the penn researchers found that some victims suffered cognitive damage, but another researcher thinks they're wrong.

According to a study published monday in proceedings of the national academy of sciences, there may be microbes living up to six miles under the seafloor. Researchers used a remotely operated vehicle to retrieve 46 samples of a rock called serpentine from a mud volcano near the mariana trench — the deepest place on earth — southwest of japan, phys.org reports. According to live science, the serpentine may have originated more than 12 miles under the seafloor before being spewed out by the mud volcano. While the serpentine didn't contain any actual microbes, researchers did find what national geographic calls \" tantalizing traces of organic material. \" due to the particulars of the subduction zone at the mariana trench, the researchers believe the microbes could have survived up to six miles below the seafloor before the pressure and heat became too much. They believe the organisms could survive on the methane and hydrogen produced when serpentine forms. \" this is another hint at a great, deep biosphere on our planet, \" study lead oliver plümper says.

Bitcoin hit $ 15,000 early thursday, just 12 hours after it passed the $ 14,000 mark, reports business insider, which puts the digital currency's 36-hour increase at more than $ 3,000. To illustrate the massive growth another way: 10 days ago, the cryptocurrency market as a whole was worth $ 300 billion; now it's above $ 400 billion, per coinmarketcap.com. The quote of the day on the subject comes from royal bank of scotland chair sir howard davies, who called the whole situation \" irrational exuberance \" in comments to bloomberg and warned, \" all the authorities can do is put up the sign from dante's inferno: ' abandon hope all ye who enter here. ' \" per the guardian, davies couldn't identify a \" rational reason \" for the rise, but coindesk shares the \" primary theory, \" which boils down to the fact that bitcoin futures will begin trading for the first time this month and \" big institutional money \" is getting in on the game. As the ap earlier reported, the cme group, which owns the chicago mercantile exchange, got the ok on friday to begin trading bitcoin futures on dec. 18; cboe global markets will do so as well.
