Since 1999, the national institute of standards and technology has determined the time based on an atomic clock known as nist-f1. Now there's a new and improved version of the clock — and it's \" the most accurate clock of its kind in the world, \" the institute says. Nist-f2 boasts three times the accuracy of f1. \" if you could run either of these clocks for 100 million years, nist-f1 would lose one second; nist-f2 would lose 1/3 of a second, \" says f2's lead designer. One second is defined worldwide in terms of oscillations of a cesium atom ( 9,192,631,770 of those oscillations, to be precise ). Both clocks determine the time by tossing 10 million such atoms into the air and using lasers to analyze them, the los angeles times explains. What's better about the new clock is that it uses chilled conditions to fight background radiation, thus improving its assessment. Why be so careful? everything from cell phones to gps use atomic clock measurements, researchers say, per pc magazine. \" if we've learned anything in the last 60 years of building atomic clocks, we've learned that every time we build a better clock, somebody comes up with a use for it that you couldn't have foreseen, \" says the designer.",

            "A woman in spain who suddenly became very religious and believed she was speaking with the virgin mary turned out to have a brain tumor that appears to have caused her symptoms, according to a new report of the case.

She appeared sad and withdrawn, and also showed increasing interest in the bible and other sacred writings, the report said. The woman started spending hours during the day reciting religious writings. She also had mystical experiences, in which she reported seeing, feeling and talking with the virgin mary, the report said. [ 8 ways religion impacts your life ] those close to her thought the woman might be experiencing depression, because she was caring for a relative with cancer at the time.

The tumors were too large to treat with surgery, so the woman received chemotherapy and radiation for the cancer. Her doctors also prescribed antipsychotic drugs for her, because some studies have suggested this class of drugs may have an anti-cancer effect on glioblastoma. During the woman's five-week treatment, her religious visions gradually disappeared, the report said.

Unfortunately, numerous studies suggest that the levels of blue light in the high-intensity led bulbs could have health ramifications, including sleep problems and even increased risk for cancer and heart disease. The evidence is apparently strong enough to prompt the american medical association to issue a warning in june that led street lights can impair and even damage nighttime vision, reports tech times. Problem is, almost 13 % of roadway lighting now uses leds, with many places planning a switch, reports the washington post. Seattle has been downright dismissive of any health concerns, while new york has gone so far as to switch to lower-intensity led bulbs the ama considers safe when residents complain. Lake worth, fla., meanwhile, has plans to replace its sodium street lights with more than 4,000 led lights that have less of the potentially harmful blue light and more of an amber hue, while gloucester, mass., has consulted its own residents and decided to play it safe and go with less blue in their leds, which they ' ll finish installing next month.

Reporting in the journal demography, the two researchers looked at us census data and found that immigrants tend to choose jobs requiring physical strength, suggesting obstacles to accessing to higher levels of education. But among immigrants with a college degree, the landscape is very different. Those who went to college, came to the states as older children, and hailed from a country more linguistically different than the us ( think vietnam vs. Germany ) were much more likely to pursue a science, tech, engineering, or math ( stem ) field. This is especially true for kids arriving after age 10.

Residents of the south miami neighborhood where the incident took place say they've actually named the three large crocodiles that live behind their homes — pancho, snaggletooth, and streetwalker — and wildlife officials assume one of those three is to blame, the guardian reports. Jimenez is still in the hospital recovering from bites on his torso and hands; rendon is home recovering from a shoulder bite. One wildlife official says the couple struggled with the 9-foot crocodile and eventually made their way to shore, where other partygoers who heard the noise pulled them out of the water. Officials aren't calling it an attack, though, because \" crocodiles are most active at dawn and dusk, they're looking for food, and this one would have interpreted what was in the water as food, \" he said. \" it's common sense never to swim where you know there are crocodiles and alligators. \" crocodiles typically avoid contact with humans, reuters notes.

Trappers had one of the crocodiles hooked monday night, but it managed to wrestle itself free and swim away, so tuesday the game of hide-and-seek continues. \" we had one hooked for quite some time, but unfortunately he broke the line, \" said florida fish and wildlife conservation commission spokesperson jorge pino. Fwc officials said a crocodile bit two swimmers who jumped into a canal sometime between 2 a.m. And 3 a.m., sunday, at the end of a house party along the 1300 block of lugo avenue and gables by the sea. Pino said, \" they were jumping in and out of the water. Perhaps that attracted the attention of the crocodile. \" alejandro jimenez and lisset rendon, who were guests at the party, decided to take a late-night swim in the canal, and that's when they were attacked by a crocodile lurking beneath the surface. \" one crocodile came up and bit the female in the shoulder, \" said pino. \" she managed to get away and swim to the dock. The male that was also swimming also suffered some injuries or bites to his hands, but he also managed to make it to the dock safely. \""

The canadian prime minister says the vice president told him there would have to be a \" sunset clause \" guaranteeing that the deal would expire in five years, the washington post reports. Trudeau says this would create far too much uncertainty for businesses. He says the visit was called off after he made it clear to pence that no canadian leader would sign a deal containing a sunset clause. Trump said in a statement thursday that the us \" has been taken advantage of for many decades on trade \" and the message was conveyed to trudeau that washington will \" agree to a fair deal, or there will be no deal at all. \" \" fair trade! \" he tweeted. Trudeau denounced new us tariffs on canadian, mexican, and eu imports as \" totally unacceptable \" and said ottawa will slap tariffs on $ 12.8 billion worth of us goods, the ap reports. Trump previously framed our dependence on imported metals as a national security threat, and trudeau addressed that: \" canada is a secure supplier of aluminum and steel to the us defense industry, putting aluminum in american planes and steel in american tanks. That canada could be considered a national security threat to the united states is inconceivable. \" mexico also vowed to penalize us imports, and french president emmanuel macron said friday he had spoken to trump and told him the tariffs were an illegal \" mistake \" that would draw a \" firm \" response.",

        "summary": "Doctors have discovered a more accurate way to prenatally test for chromosome disorders like down syndrome, and it's less stressful for the mother to boot. Normally, if an ultrasound and blood test show a woman's risk of an affected pregnancy is high, doctors can perform additional tests to identify possible down syndrome, edwards syndrome, or patau syndrome using a needle that collects fluid or tissue from a woman's womb. These procedures — either an amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling — aren't fun, nor are the weeks of worry that can precede them. But researcher nicholas wald says new \" reflex dna screening \" led to a 100-fold reduction in false positives at five uk maternity wards and prevented \" nearly all invasive diagnostic tests in unaffected pregnancies, \" per a release. In this method, described in genetics in medicine, doctors take a blood sample from a woman around 11 weeks of pregnancy and split it into two. If the first sample shows a woman's risk for an affected pregnancy is 1 in 800 or higher, doctors use the second sample to search for dna from the placenta that would indicate a disorder, reports the guardian. Over a 16-month study period involving 23,000 women, the test detected 95 % of affected pregnancies, compared to 81 % with the previous method. The rate of false positives, meanwhile, fell to 0.02 % from 2.4 %. In the end, only one of 26 women who underwent the diagnostic test had an unaffected pregnancy, adds wald, who notes \" the extra costs of the dna tests are offset against savings from fewer amniocenteses and associated counseling. \"",

        "summary": "Two great american crime novelists may have relied on a man unknown to history — a black detective in los angeles — to help them get their facts straight, the la times reports. Samuel marlowe, said to be the city's first black gumshoe, worked for celebrities, studios, and speakeasies in the 1930s, trailing the girlfriends of wealthy clients and pulling movie stars out of bars on the \" wrong \" side of town, according to his descendants and a hollywood screenwriter. Marlowe also reportedly corresponded with raymond chandler and dashiell hammett, the authors of noir classics like the long goodbye and the maltese falcon, respectively, with insights into detective-life and prohibition-era los angeles. Only problem: all of marlowe's correspondence has vanished. The screenwriter, louise ransil, says she saw the handwritten letters at marlowe's old house before a real estate agent apparently had them dumped when selling the property. Now one of marlowe's great grandsons is digging through an old building where his dad ran a thrift shop, but the letters still haven't turned up. Nor has proof that marlowe was la's first black detective: \" i am more interested in [ his ] legacy, and the legacy of african american men who have blazed a trail and gone unrecognized, \" he says. A propos, there's a new book out ( the great new orleans kidnapping case, by michael ross ) about a case in reconstruction-era new orleans that was investigated by john jourdain — possibly the first black detective to receive national attention, the new york times reports.",

            "Michael a. Ross, the author of a well-regarded study of the supreme court during the civil war, thought of himself as a \"meat and potatoes \" legal historian. But a decade ago in a new orleans archive, something a bit spicier caught his eye: an 1870 newspaper article describing the \"voodoo abduction \" of a white toddler by two mysterious black women. \"i thought to myself, 'this can't possibly be true, ' \" mr. Ross recalled recently by telephone. The voodoo angle turned out to be hysterical rumor. But as he read on, mr. Ross, now a professor at the university of maryland, discovered an all-but-forgotten story of a sensational investigation and trial that gripped new orleans and the national press for almost seven months. \"there were so many other twists and turns that i was hooked, \" he said. Those twists, recounted by mr. Ross in \"the great new orleans kidnapping case: race, law and justice in the reconstruction era, \" published this week by oxford university press, include psychic consultations, a shadowy \"house of secret obstetrics \" and the derring-do of a crack afro-creole police detective versed in the latest \"french \" techniques — seemingly the first black detective in the united states to take part in a case that received national attention, mr.

Over time, however, most christians reject the literal interpretation for one more in keeping with the bible's \" core values of compassion, justice and peace. \" pearce says most scholars agree that only three new testament passages address homosexuality, though not \" as we define it today but rather with temple prostitution and other abuses. \" and yes, the old testament says it merits execution, but the same applies to unruly sons and those who work on sundays. \" it will only be a matter of time before the majority of christians of all stripes become allies rather than antagonists for justice and equal rights for gay people, \" writes pearce. \" then we will come out on the right side of history once again. \" read the full column here.

Yahle fully awoke five days later, and though doctors thought he'd need a heart transplant, he appears in fine health. \" he doesn't have one broken rib, \" his wife says. \" he's not sore.

Bradley may have been involved with the first; the gear he was wearing that day doesn't sync with what is captured in the photo. Although schultz, who received a purple heart for his war efforts, never publicly acknowledged any possible role, his stepdaughter tells the new york times that one fleeting dinner conversation about iwo jima in the early 1990s led her to believe he was in the photo. \" my mom was distracted and not listening and harold said, ' i was one of the flag raisers, ' \" dezreen macdowell says. \" i said, ' my gosh, harold, you're a hero.

        "summary": "It isn't only elephants that are suffering from humans ' insatiable thirst for ivory. A new study notes hippopotamuses, already predicted by some to disappear within 100 years, may be dying at unexpected rates to fuel the trade of ivory ornaments made from hippo teeth. Since 1975, 1.7 million pounds of hippo teeth have been traded around the world, with 90 % of that trade passing through hong kong, according to researchers at the university of hong kong. Of that 90 %, 75 % has come from uganda and tanzania. Like hong kong, both african countries report their legal trade volumes to cites, an organization that monitors trade in threatened species. What irks researchers, however, is that the reported volumes don't add up. Cites data shows hong kong has actually received more hippo teeth from tanzania since 1980 than tanzania claims it exported, and less hippo teeth from uganda since 1991 than uganda claims it sent, notes the study in the african journal of ecology. The result is 30,860 pounds of hippo teeth — the equivalent from 2,700 hippos, or 2 % of the animal's global population — overlooked, reports quartz. \" if authorities do not more diligently monitor the international trade in threatened species, those species could be exposed to unmanageable exploitation levels, which could lead to extinction, \" says study author alexandra andersson in a release. \" the fate of hippos — and a plethora of other species — could depend on it. \" ( people are also getting ivory from … woolly mammoths. )",

            "Hippos are threatened by habitat loss, hunting and climate change. Credit: the university of hong kong global wildlife trade is pushing many species to the brink of extinction. The convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ( cites ) was established to regulate this trade, but inadequate monitoring may facilitate or lead to unsustainable levels of exploitation. A recent study by the school of biological sciences of the university of hong kong ( hku ) examined the case of hippo teeth and revealed discordance in trade volumes declared between importers and exporters - a scenario that could threaten the survival of the species. The findings have been published in the african journal of ecology. \" if authorities do not more diligently monitor the international trade in threatened species, those species could be exposed to unmanageable exploitation levels, which could lead to extinction, \" said alexandra andersson from the school of biological sciences, who led the study. Since cites trade records began in 1975, over 770,000 kg of hippo ( hippopotamus amphibius ) teeth have been traded internationally - and 90 % of this trade has passed through hong kong. Of that imported to hong kong, over 75 % has come from just two countries: tanzania and uganda. Cites records show significant discrepancies between hippo teeth trade volumes declared by the main exporters, uganda and tanzania, and the main importer hong kong, which points to potential mismanagement",
            "As the global epicentre of wildlife trade, hong kong plays an important role in the preservation or demise of biodiversity, including species found continents away. If mismanaged, legal trade in threatened species can lead to unsustainable exploitation. Inaccurate and incomplete trade records from the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ( cites ) undermine the regulation of this trade. We examine the trade of hippo ( hippopotamus amphibius ) teeth to illustrate the extent of mismatched data between key trading nations. More than 90 % of global hippo teeth trade is imported to, and re‐exported from, hong kong. Of that imported, over 75 % originated in tanzania or uganda, but there are notable disparities in declared trade volumes. In most transactions, hong kong declares more volume imported than the volume declared exported by uganda. Overall, hong kong has reported the import of 3,176 kg more hippo teeth than declared exported by tanzania. This indicates that actual trade levels may exceed internationally agreed quotas. In total, over 14,000 kg of hippo teeth is unaccounted for between uganda and hong kong, representing more than 2,700 individual hippos — 2 % of the global population. This gross discordance in trade data undermines regulatory measures and challenges the persistence of hippo populations in africa."

            "Hippos are threatened by habitat loss, hunting and climate change. Credit: the university of hong kong global wildlife trade is pushing many species to the brink of extinction. The convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ( cites ) was established to regulate this trade, but inadequate monitoring may facilitate or lead to unsustainable levels of exploitation. A recent study by the school of biological sciences of the university of hong kong ( hku ) examined the case of hippo teeth and revealed discordance in trade volumes declared between importers and exporters - a scenario that could threaten the survival of the species. The findings have been published in the african journal of ecology. \" if authorities do not more diligently monitor the international trade in threatened species, those species could be exposed to unmanageable exploitation levels, which could lead to extinction, \" said alexandra andersson from the school of biological sciences, who led the study. Since cites trade records began in 1975, over 770,000 kg of hippo ( hippopotamus amphibius ) teeth have been traded internationally - and 90 % of this trade has passed through hong kong. Of that imported to hong kong, over 75 % has come from just two countries: tanzania and uganda. Cites records show significant discrepancies between hippo teeth trade volumes declared by the main exporters, uganda and tanzania, and the main importer hong kong, which points to potential mismanagement",
            "As the global epicentre of wildlife trade, hong kong plays an important role in the preservation or demise of biodiversity, including species found continents away. If mismanaged, legal trade in threatened species can lead to unsustainable exploitation. Inaccurate and incomplete trade records from the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ( cites ) undermine the regulation of this trade. We examine the trade of hippo ( hippopotamus amphibius ) teeth to illustrate the extent of mismatched data between key trading nations. More than 90 % of global hippo teeth trade is imported to, and re‐exported from, hong kong. Of that imported, over 75 % originated in tanzania or uganda, but there are notable disparities in declared trade volumes. In most transactions, hong kong declares more volume imported than the volume declared exported by uganda. Overall, hong kong has reported the import of 3,176 kg more hippo teeth than declared exported by tanzania. This indicates that actual trade levels may exceed internationally agreed quotas. In total, over 14,000 kg of hippo teeth is unaccounted for between uganda and hong kong, representing more than 2,700 individual hippos — 2 % of the global population. This gross discordance in trade data undermines regulatory measures and challenges the persistence of hippo populations in africa."

        "summary": "An assistant pastor killed during an encounter with oklahoma troopers friday night played a key role in his own demise, according to the oklahoma highway patrol. In a short press conference monday, capt. Paul timmons said the shooting victim, nehemiah fischer, attacked a trooper and pushed him to the ground. Timmons also presented a 35-second clip of what the tulsa world reports is 30 minutes of dash-cam footage. The clip shows two ohp troopers shouting at the assistant pastor and his brother, brandon fischer. The two had been fishing on their dad's property in rural okmulgee county when their truck stalled on a flooded road; the troopers showed up at around 9: 30pm to find the men apparently standing in rising floodwaters trying to push the truck. \" come on! get out of that water! boys, state troopers! \" trooper mark southall shouts in the video. \" settle down, you understand me? settle down. \" the brothers can be seen entering the video; nehemiah rushes southall and the two move off-camera; the other trooper is filmed drawing his gun, then the clip ends. Timmons said both officers fired their guns at nehemiah. The ap reports that the troopers recovered what they said was a weapon belonging to nehemiah at the scene. The 35-year-old's father says he gave his son a.380 handgun as an april 14 birthday gift, a weapon he says nehemiah generally carried while fishing and as a defense against snakes. The troopers — southall has eight years ' experience, the other has one — are on administrative leave. Meanwhile, brandon, 41, appeared in district court monday via video feed over two complaints: public intoxication and assault and battery on an officer. ( friends continue to say nehemiah's alleged behavior doesn't make any sense. )",

Overturning dietary guidelines the world over, the research of mente and his team indicates that a higher consumption of fats, even saturated fats like those found in meat and butter, reduces chances of dying earlier. The scientists who tracked 135,000 adults in 18 countries found that those who got more than 60 % of their calories from carbohydrates, such as sugary drinks and processed foods like pasta and bread, had a 28 % chance of dying early. Those who consumed high levels of fats, even the saturated kind, saw their risk of early death drop by 23 %. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the seven-year study found no link between fat consumption alone and heart disease or stroke, cbc news reports. But in a notable limitation, researchers were unable to measure levels of trans fat, often linked to heart disease, in study subjects. Study co-author dr. Mahshid dehghan says that when lowering fat consumption, people \" by default \" eat more carbs. He called for \" relaxing current restrictions on fat and emphasizing... Carbohydrate intake. \" the \" sweet spot, \" mente adds, per the telegraph, is maintaining a balanced diet, with about 35 % of calories coming from fat. ( for a longer life, go japanese. )",

The researchers injected human stem cells into pig embryos, then implanted those embryos into adult pigs. After a month or so, the developing pig was part human, and the stem cells were turning into the makings of a heart, liver, and neurons, according to the washington post. Researchers published their findings thursday in cell. Still, the embryos were less than 0.001 % human. And seeker reports the host pigs were \" euthanized and incinerated \" after four weeks to prevent the accidental creation of super-smart pigs or something equally horrifying. The goal of the research is to eventually be able to grow human organs inside \" large host animals. \" approximately 22 people in the us die every day while waiting for an organ transplant. Researchers say this new process could allow organs to be grown on demand, ending organ shortages. But they warn that's far in the future. In the meantime, it could be used to research diseases and test drugs in animals. But there are still moral questions surrounding the creation of animal-human chimeras, with some scientists expressing concern about making animals with human brains or reproductive organs.

        "summary": "A new study out of the university of texas ' center for brainhealth and the mind research network is showing brain differences in regular pot users — differences that have already been reported in lab mice. The study, published in pnas, found that 48 \" chronic \" users who smoked at least four times a week had less gray matter in the orbitofrontal cortex than 62 control subjects who didn't use pot, reports the los angeles times. The orbitofrontal cortex \" helps us determine what is good for us and what keeps us sustained, \" the lead author tells the washington post. It's unclear whether these \" shrunken brains \" are the result of chronic use or contribute to the tendency to use in the first place. Researchers also found that the orbitofrontal cortex is better connected in chronic users, with a faster signal flow throughout the motivation- and decision-making network and even across the white matter connecting the brain's left and right hemispheres. One possible explanation? that increased \" connectedness \" might be compensating for the not-up-to-snuff gray matter. That finding was more pronounced for users who started smoking pot young, \" which may explain why chronic, long-term users'seem to be doing just fine'despite smaller ofc brain volumes, \" according to a release. An earlier study from 2012 found that 12-year-olds with smaller orbitofrontal cortices were more likely to start using pot by age 16, indicating a possible predisposition to marijuana use in those with deficits in this part of the brain.

        "summary": "Aaron sorkin makes his directorial debut in molly's game, derived from molly bloom's tell-all book of the same name. It chronicles the real-life events surrounding bloom's weekly high-stakes poker game frequented by celebrities before it was busted by the fbi. Critics give the film starring jessica chastain an 82 % rating on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: \" this is a ' game'that couldn't be more fun to watch, \" writes calvin wilson at the st. Louis post-dispatch. \" sorkin crafts a fast-moving tale of risky business, crammed with the kind of snappy dialogue for which he's famous \" in a \" stylish and absorbing \" debut. \" but the film wouldn't work quite as well without chastain, \" who \" gets deep inside molly's skin, \" he writes. It's \" an oscar-worthy performance. \" \" despite ms. Chastain's charisma and gift for delivering mr. Sorkin's fast talk, molly isn't interesting, \" writes manohla dargis at the new york times, detecting a \" patronizing \" air in the way the protagonist receives \" so much male defending. \" \" by attempting to portray molly as any kind of female victim — and by glossing over her culpability — mr. Sorkin only ends up denying this character her agency, \" dargis writes. Michael phillips, however, thinks molly's game is \" a good, brash biopic \" and \" very nearly terrific \" through the first hour. Moving between the past and present, it sees chastain nail the role of bloom, while idris elba is \" a godsend \" as her attorney with \" a lively wit and fire in the eyes, \" phillips writes at the chicago tribune. He argues the film falters in the second half when \" the writing gets blunt and a little less artful. \" bob mondello was impressed throughout. Thanks to a \" whip-smart \" cast, the \" sorkinian back-and-forth dialogue is exhilarating \" and helps make \" the finer points of poker — and legal maneuvering — crystal clear, \" a necessity in such a \" dense, complicated movie, \" he writes at npr. The visuals, \" precisely shot and edited with nearly every trick known to contemporary filmmaking, \" are just as good, he adds.",

Lawyers for james fields suggested as much monday as jury selection got underway in the closely watched murder trial in virginia, reports c-ville.

Dixon is affiliated with the antifa movement, and he has publicly talked about seeing fields on the block he was patrolling shortly before the crash. In a speech at harvard, dixon said fields \" paused right in front of me, and i waved him off with my rifle, \" per indyweek. Far-right conspiracy theorists have used dixon's comments to make the case that fields was fleeing when he drove into the crowd, per the daily progress. Prosecutors plans to show jurors video showing that fields backed up, then accelerated into the counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old heather heyer. Also on the witness list: an officer, one who normally worked as a school resource officer, who left her position before the crash because she feared for her personal safety.

The 67-year-old, the oldest prisoner on the state's death row, was executed hours after the supreme court rejected an appeal, abc news reports. Prosecutors said that in 1983, bower shot contractor bob tate to steal an ultralight aircraft, then killed three other men who unexpectedly arrived at the hangar, reports reuters. But bower always maintained his innocence, and his execution was stayed six times, most recently in february. \" much has been written about this case, not all of it has been the truth, \" he said in his final statement. \" but the time is over and now it is time to move on. \" he was pronounced dead at 6: 36pm yesterday. When bower was arrested, he was working as a chemical salesman, had no criminal record, and was married with two daughters. In his appeals, his lawyers argued that there was no hard evidence connecting him to the crime and the killings had actually occurred after a drug deal gone wrong, the guardian reports. His lawyers also argued that the long time bower spent on death row constituted cruel and unusual punishment, but state officials countered that his claims were a \" meritless attempt to postpone his execution \" and the length of time on death row was \" purely of his own making \" because he had spent so long fighting his conviction in the courts, reports the washington post.

When someone from the office read about it on tmz. Law enforcement sources tell tmz no one from the rehab facility called the county coroner — and now both the coroner and the la county sheriff's department are suspicious and are investigating kelly's death. Another cause of their suspicion: the rehab doctor said an embolism caused kelly's death, but the coroner says there's no way he could have known that without doing an autopsy. Kelly's autopsy was completed over the weekend, but her official cause of death is not yet known. The doctor also told the coroner kelly was on detox drugs when she died, sources say, but it won't be clear whether they played a role in her death until the toxicology report is in. Meanwhile, kelly's estranged husband ( who earlier blamed kelly's new boyfriend for the actress'recent troubles ) is blabbing away about her death in a national enquirer article picked up by radar. He says the 43-year-old had a congenital heart defect, and that back in 2011 she was drinking as much as a half-gallon of vodka per day. \" you can't do to the human body what lisa did, for the length of time that she did, and expect to survive, \" he says.

Some 150,000 years ago, a young girl lost her baby tooth, and it fell into the sediment of a cave in siberia from which the first three ( and thus far only ) other fossils identified in 2010 as being denisovan were found, reports live science. Before then, the hominin group that's as genetically distinct from modern humans as neanderthals was completely unknown. This fourth fossil is the oldest, per the paper in the science advances journal, suggesting that the mysterious group lived in central asia so long ago that there was likely greater interaction with, and thus more potential to interbreed with, neanderthals — something we humans appear to have done, too. Five years ago, scientists would have probably had to destroy the tooth to study its genetic fingerprints, but recently viviane slon at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in germany was able to scrape the tooth's surface and drill into its root to collect 10 milligrams of material that contained the dna her team ultimately studied. \" we only have relatively little data from this archaic group, so having any additional individuals is something we're very excited about, \" she tells the new york times. The other three fossils, a finger bone and two molars, were also unearthed in the denisova cave in the altai mountains of siberia. The baby tooth, found in deep sediment as much as 227,000 years old, is one of the oldest human specimens ever found in central asia.

Although modern humans are the only surviving human lineage, other hominins — which include modern humans, extinct human species and their immediate ancestors — once lived on earth. These included neanderthals, the closest extinct relatives of modern humans, as well as the denisovans, who lived across a region that might have stretched from siberia to southeast asia. In 2010, researchers analyzed dna from fossils to reveal the existence of the denisovans, suggesting the lineage shared a common ancestor with neanderthals.

Scientists tested the skin, blood, and urine of people before and after they handled receipts and other thermal papers that use bisphenol a as a print developer — and found that levels of the chemical rose, forbes reports. Although the cdc won't definitively acknowledge bpa's risks — \" more research is needed \" is the official hedge on its fact sheet — webmd points to various studies that have linked bpa to a variety of health issues, including a higher risk of cancer, heart problems, and brain and behavioral issues in babies and young children. Researchers who conducted the new study in plos one had participants handle receipt paper, then asked some of them to eat french fries using their hands. Bpa levels in the skin spiked to 581 micrograms of bpa within 45 seconds ( and 40 % of that was absorbed in just two seconds ). Urine and blood bpa levels were also strikingly higher 90 minutes after holding the receipts — and numbers here were on par with those from previous studies that were linked to type 2 diabetes and heart disease, forbes notes. Levels were even higher for subjects who had used hand sanitizer before handling the receipts; scientists attribute this to sanitizers ( and toiletries like sunscreen and lotion ) making hands more absorbent. Forbes notes the study was \" quite small and more research will be needed, \" while a spokesman for the american chemistry council notes the study's \" unrealistic experimental conditions \" and that \" much of the data presented in this new study has very limited relevance to the potential for human exposure to bpa from handling thermal receipt paper. \" ( your bpa-free water bottle may still not be safe. )",

Or at least that seemed like a fine game plan until the mother of his child, oksana grigorieva, accused him of physically abusing her and their baby, and released recordings of phone calls that purportedly show him crazily gasping to fill his lungs in order to more effectively call her three nasty names over and over again. Now, summit finds itself what's the technical term they use in hollywood? oh yes: superfucked. Execs at the company privately admit that even they don't know what to do with the jodie foster – directed movie, the story of a depressed man who suffers a psychotic break when his family abandons him and becomes best friends with a beaver hand puppet that he imbues with an alternate personality with a british accent. One summit suit calls the situation \"unprecedented. \" so what are their options? we've laid them out below, and as you ' ll see, none of them are good. Option 1: send the beaver directly to dvd. Why it could work: the beaver might never earn back from theaters what it would cost to market the movie in the first place, so why not go to dvd, where you don't have the huge publicity costs to make up for? why that will never work: first, going straight to video sends audiences a message that the film is in the same league as cheapo junk like american pie presents: the naked mile. For another, you can't count on home video the way you used to for ancillary profits. The los angeles times today reports that for the first half of the year, dvd sales were down about 15 percent, while dvd rental spending declined nearly 5 percent — thanks to a 55 percent jump in revenue at $ 1 per night kiosks like red box. Option 2: market the beaver as a jodie foster film, not a mel gibson movie. Why it could work: everybody loves jodie foster! she's an american institution! and who doesn't remember little man tate fondly? why it will never work: yes, foster directed and played his wife.

Or at least that seemed like a fine game plan until the mother of his child, oksana grigorieva, accused him of physically abusing her and their baby, and released recordings of phone calls that purportedly show him crazily gasping to fill his lungs in order to more effectively call her three nasty names over and over again. Now, summit finds itself what's the technical term they use in hollywood? oh yes: superfucked. Execs at the company privately admit that even they don't know what to do with the jodie foster – directed movie, the story of a depressed man who suffers a psychotic break when his family abandons him and becomes best friends with a beaver hand puppet that he imbues with an alternate personality with a british accent. One summit suit calls the situation \"unprecedented. \" so what are their options? we've laid them out below, and as you ' ll see, none of them are good. Option 1: send the beaver directly to dvd. Why it could work: the beaver might never earn back from theaters what it would cost to market the movie in the first place, so why not go to dvd, where you don't have the huge publicity costs to make up for? why that will never work: first, going straight to video sends audiences a message that the film is in the same league as cheapo junk like american pie presents: the naked mile. For another, you can't count on home video the way you used to for ancillary profits. The los angeles times today reports that for the first half of the year, dvd sales were down about 15 percent, while dvd rental spending declined nearly 5 percent — thanks to a 55 percent jump in revenue at $ 1 per night kiosks like red box. Option 2: market the beaver as a jodie foster film, not a mel gibson movie. Why it could work: everybody loves jodie foster! she's an american institution! and who doesn't remember little man tate fondly? why it will never work: yes, foster directed and played his wife. But insiders tell us gibson is in 90 percent of the scenes in the movie, making it all but impossible to hide his"

Using info from 31.5 million insured americans ( covered by either commercial insurers or medicaid/medicare ), the report also figured out the cost to payers for these pricey prescriptions: what the report labels \" an unsustainable \" $ 52 billion per year. But insurance picks up most of the tab, with plans covering almost 98 % of the bill in the $ 100,000-plus group, per a press release.

The last confirmed sighting of him had been nov. 3, 2015, when he told his wife he was going for a bike ride. Surveillance footage revealed that he had taken a ferry from canada to port angeles in washington state. The disappearance of backer, who rowed for canada in the 1984, 1988, and 1992 olympics, became a criminal investigation within days after 15 investment clients — including friends, his brother, and his former coach, who lost $ 800,000 — received letters confessing that his business was a pyramid scheme. He said he had lost their money in the dot-com crash 15 years earlier and couldn't get it back. Police haven't commented on where they think backer spent the last 18 months.

Although there are some races still up in the air, it isn't expected those will have any significant effect in terms of handing control over to the democrats, who needed to gain 30 seats to flip the current 247-188 majority. That's not to say the gop won't suffer losses: per nbc, the party will lose between five and 20 seats \" due in large part \" to donald trump as its nominee. What may now be slipping out of dems ' grasp, thanks to this development: the chance to push through a climate change cap-and-trade bill, immigration reform, or a hike in the minimum wage, vox reports.

It's whether justice anthony kennedy plans to step down — and whether he may do so monday. What you need to know: slate points out that the speculation isn't fresh, but with monday being the court's final public session of the term, that would be the time to do it if the 80-year-old is going to do it now. Another reason the speculation is ramping up: a number of reports on the topic cite unnamed sources close to him as well as his former law clerks who say they think he's thinking about it. Cnn uses the phrase \" seriously considering. \" and this from the ap: \" kennedy and his clerks were gathering over the weekend for a reunion that was pushed up a year and helped spark talk he might be leaving the court. \" bill kristol put it at \" at least 50-50 \" in a saturday tweet. The washington examiner throws one more log on the fire, reporting senate judiciary committee members ted cruz and chuck grassley previously expressed that they expect a seat to open up this summer. A piece from new zealand's stuff calls kennedy \" the man with the weight of america's goofy-shaped democracy on his shoulders, \" and that points to just how pivotal he has been. Cnn frames it like so: \" like no other justice in recent history, kennedy has cast the vital swing vote in cases that grab the [ country's ] attention. \" among the biggest: obergefell v. Hodges, which allowed for same-sex marriage nationwide. On the flip side, cnn notes he wrote the majority opinion in citizens united v. Fec, which axed election spending limits for corporations. Should the retirement announcement come to pass, who might trump replace him with? trump addressed that question in a late april interview with the washington times, saying he'd pick from the list of candidates he put out during the election. Trump also addressed the kennedy rumors, saying, \" i don't like talking about it. I've heard the same rumors that a lot of people have heard.

Police explain the timeline, via the arizona republic: the child, mother tiffani nelson, and an 8-year-old sister spent the night at courtney arnold's home. Arnold and nelson both had choir practice to attend; because nelson had to get there early, arnold, 27, agreed to bring her own daughter, along with nelson's kids, later. Azfamily.com reports that arnold arrived around 11am. In an emailed statement, police say \" indications are the suspect was a bit late and she and the other children exited the car. The suspect went immediately into the church for practice. \" hayden was somehow left behind and spent three hours in the vehicle before his mother and churchmembers began searching for him. Outside temps at the time were as high as 96 degrees. The boy had stopped breathing, and died sunday in the hospital. Prosecutors are still considering whether to bring charges against arnold, though officer james holmes paints it as a tragic accident: \" it's obvious that the 27-year-old forgot that the child was in the car.

That's the repast writer kristin vukovic enjoyed at the zasavica special nature reserve in serbia, where milk from the beasts of burden is used to make the world's most expensive cheese. A small cupcake-sized mound of the stuff will set you back some $ 55. Writing for the bbc, vukovic describes the cheese, which can cost $ 600 to more than $ 1,000 a pound, as \" sweet, clean, and mild, unlike any cheese i had ever tasted. \" ( another writer described the flavor of the \" magareci sir, \" aka \" pule cheese, \" as \" fusty-musty, \" per a 2012 new york times piece. ) former politician slobodan simic started the zasavica reserve about two decades ago. A few years after that, he rescued some abused balkan donkeys. Now, the females in his herd of about 180 animals are responsible for supplying all the milk for the world's donkey cheese supply, per the mother nature network. Vitamin-rich, donkey milk has long been heralded as an immunity booster, anti-aging serum, and a kind of natural viagra. More recently, simic had the idea to start making cheese with the milk of donkeys. Because the milk is low in a protein needed to make cheese, it is mixed with goat's milk — 60/40, favoring donkey milk. Production of the donkey cheese is similar to that of goat cheese, vukovic writes, but the \" exact method is a secret. \" as for why it's so expensive, it takes 3 gallons of donkey milk to produce a pound of cheese, and female donkeys ( who must be milked manually three times a day ) don't produce much milk. The cheese — which made headlines in 2012 on a rumor that tennis star novak djokovic was buying the whole year's supply — isn't the only donkey product zasavica makes. The farm's offerings include soap, face creams, and a donkey-milk liqueur. As for the sausage, zasavica's farm manager tells vukovic that it is made from male donkeys that have taken on a taboo interest in their female offspring.

Ted cruz, the new york times reports. Speaking at a closed-door gop event in new york city, the two conservatives — mick mulvaney, federal budget director, and ronna mcdaniel, rnc chairwoman — said the gop has the money and infrastructure to repel a november \" blue wave \" but admitted that enthusiasm is high among democrats. \" there's a very real possibility we will win a race for senate in florida and lose a race in texas for senate, ok? \" said mulvaney in a recording obtained by the times. \" i don't think it's likely, but it's a possibility. How likable is a candidate? that still counts. \" he criticized democrats for fueling a \" movement of hate \" against trump and lacking a \" signature piece of legislation. \" and when mcdaniel spoke, she derided the dnc for raising only $ 116 million compared to $ 227 million by the gop. But they did note high democratic turnout in the midterm primaries and conceded a widespread dislike for trump. Their warning echoed recent comments by republican strategists who say the gop has offered weak nominees for races in the house, where democrats need 23 seats to take over. As for cruz — who is holding a 4.4 % polling lead over rival beto o ' rourke, per real clear politics — he dismissed the budget chief's words: \" i don't worry about what some political guy in washington says, \" said the senator. \" i worry about what the people of texas say. \"",

            "Race analysis 10/26/18 -- as predicted, this race seems to have broken away from democrats. Ted cruz is not going to win by 20 points like greg abbott, but a win is a win, especially in a largely negative environment for republicans. 9/25/18 -- the latest quinnipiac puts cruz ahead by a comfortable 54-45 margin. If you look at the polling data as a whole, the polls with more undecideds tend to show a close race, while pollsters who push undecideds harder show a cruz lead. This is consistent with a storyline suggesting that there are a large number of undecideds, perhaps intrigued by the beto phenomeon, but who nevertheless lean republicans. But in this chaotic environment, we should still consider the race a tossup overall. 9/13/18 -- beto o ' rourke has kept the race close, albeit in part on the basis of an emerson poll showing over 20 percent of the electorate undecided. Nevertheless, this race is going to drain republican resources, and ted cruz could very much lose this. ---------- race preview ---------- the rise of the republican party in the lone star state is a fascinating tale of how one party consistently bit off its nose to spite its face. Texas always had a small republican party in the panhandle, in the german counties north of san antonio, and later in the growing suburbs"

            "Madison, wi — the wisconsin state assembly has just passed gov. Scott walker's budget repair bill, including its controversial provisions to eliminate almost all collective bargaining rights for public employee unions as well as many other provisions to weaken union organizing. After much buildup in the 61-hour debate — of republicans wanting things to be over, and democrats railing against republicans who they said would cut off debate — at about 1 am speaker pro tempore bill kramer ( r ) announced that he would hear a voice vote for a roll call on final passage. Immediately, the majority republicans shouted their ayes, and the democrats were booing, as they tried to be recognized to demand a separate motion to cut off debate. Then kramer called the vote. Within seconds, the digital vote system on the wall announced 51 ayes and 17 nays, and voting was suddenly closed. With a total of 96 members, that got to a majority for the bill but left 28 members who hadn't had a chance yet to vote. At that point, the democrats got up, chanting \"shame! shame! shame! \" and similar exclamations, as the republicans filed out of the room. There were many democrats i spoke to and overheard in the chamber, who said they didn't get a chance to vote, or",

Two wet summers kept crowds away and a series of financial problems immediately followed. Late this season, the state temporarily shut down two of his new waterslides when they were found to have high levels of bacteria. The state also said he put up the slides without a required review. \" we've done things, taken short term loans, worked for free to try to keep it going, \" dumont told the ap the day before he ended his effort. \" but unfortunately, our loan just wasn't performing. The bank had to call our loan. \" a gofundme page raised just $ 1,945 toward a $ 1 million goal, and interest from four potential investors didn't lead to a rescue. A total of $ 1.6 million was needed to keep the property — including his home — off the auction block. Click for more on how dumont spent the 17 days ( including how he went to the bathroom ).",

The study, published in nature, looked at chimp-on-chimp killings in 18 chimp communities over a span of five decades and assessed how much those communities had been affected by human activities. Researchers found killings to be most common in the east african communities that had been least touched by humans, according to a press release. At the site most affected by human interference, in guinea, no killings took place. \" patterns of lethal aggression... Show little correlation with human impacts, \" the authors say, \" but are instead better explained by the adaptive hypothesis that killing is a means to eliminate rivals when the costs of killing are low. \" researchers concluded that, in addition to eliminating rivals, chimps kill to get better mates, food, resources, or access to territory. The study bolsters evidence that such killings are an evolved, adaptive tactic as chimps seek to pass on their own genes, rather than a consequence of deforestation or humans studying and feeding chimps. The findings are particularly interesting because, as the washington post reports, chimpanzees are the only animals other than humans who \" go to war \" with each other. But the study — which refutes another high-profile study blaming human interference for chimps ' warlike tendencies, the chicago tribune reports — has inspired some debate. Two anthropologists tell the new york times the researchers didn't actually establish that any of the communities studied were truly free from human interference.

That is the conclusion of an international analysis of lethal aggression among different groups of chimpanzees in africa studied over five decades. The research appears in the current issue of nature. \" observations that chimpanzees kill members of their own species have influenced efforts to understand the evolution of human violence, \" said university of michigan anthropologist john mitani, who helped to initiate and conceive the ambitious study that was conducted with 30 colleagues from around the world. The study",
            "Substantial variation exists in rates of killing across chimpanzee study sites2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12. The human impact and adaptive strategies hypotheses both seek to explain this variation, but have contrasting predictions, which we test here ( tables 1 and 2 ). The human impact hypothesis states that killing is an incidental outcome of aggression, exacerbated by human activities such as deforestation, introducing diseases, hunting or providing food. Accordingly, lethal aggression should be high where human disturbance is high8. In contrast, the adaptive strategies hypothesis views killing as an evolved tactic by which killers tend to increase their fitness through increased access to territory, food,",
            "Chimpanzees in the wild become violently aggressive on their own, rather than being driven to warlike behaviors as a result of proximity to or interaction with humans, according to a new study published wednesday in the journal nature. This runs contrary to a previous, high-profile study, which said interference from man was a key predictor of chimpanzee violence against other chimps. The new work, by some 30 ape researchers, looked at data from 18 chimpanzee communities over five decades and had 152 killings by chimpanzees to analyze. One of the scientists taking part was david morgan, research fellow with the fisher center for the study and conservation of apes at lincoln park zoo in chicago"

        "summary": "Whether you have a high-pitched voice or a lower one, a new study suggests that it was probably evident when you were just a baby. As previous research has suggested voice pitch is unchanging in adulthood and nearly set in stone by age 7, researchers in france and the uk set out to explore just how early the pitch of one's speech might be determined, per a release. Their study, published in the journal biology letters, reveals the pitch of babies ' cries is \" a significant and substantial predictor of the pitch of their speech \" at age 5, per the new york times. Given that research suggests a high-pitched voice is tied to less testosterone exposure in the womb, and vice versa, researchers say it's possible that \" a substantial proportion \" of differences in voice pitch are determined in utero. \" in utero, you have a lot of different things that can alter and impact your life — not only as a baby, but also at an adult stage, \" says researcher nicolas mathevon, who compared the \" mild discomfort cries \" of 4- and 5-year-olds ( six french girls and nine french boys ) with the same children's cries as infants. The results leads discover to predict a future reality show following \" celebrity judges as they scour maternity wards … for the iconic voice of a new generation. \" but though the study is \" intriguing \" based on its suggestion \" that individual differences in voice pitch may have their origins very, very early in development, \" carolyn hodges of boston university notes the small sample size raises the risk \" that it is not representative of the population as a whole. \" ( women may hear their voice drop after pregnancy. )",

        "summary": "Barbara cook, whose shimmering soprano made her one of broadway's leading ingenues and later a major cabaret and concert interpreter of popular american song, has died, the ap reports. She was 89. Cook died early tuesday of respiratory failure at her home in manhattan, surrounded by family and friends, according to her publicist. Her last meal was vanilla ice cream, a nod to one of her most famous roles in she loves me. On broadway, cook was best known for three roles: her portrayal of the saucy cunegonde in leonard bernstein's candide ( 1956 ); librarian marian, opposite robert preston in the music man ( 1957 ); and amalia balash, the letter-writing heroine of she loves me ( 1963 ). Yet when cook's ingenue days were over, she found a second, longer career in clubs and concert halls, working for more than 30 years with wally harper, a pianist and music arranger. Born in atlanta in 1927, cook hated vocal exercises and never had a vocal coach. \" i don't remember when i didn't sing. I just always sang, \" she said in 2011. \" i think i breathed and i sang. \" cook made her broadway debut in 1951's flahooley, a short-lived musical fantasy that became a cult classic, then turned to solo shows after her broadway career withered in the late 1960s as she battled alcoholism and weight gain. She gave up drinking in the 1970s and, with the help of harper, reinvented herself as a solo artist, working in small nyc clubs and finally carnegie hall. When asked what her advice usually was to aspiring singers, she once told the ap it boiled down to three words: \" you are enough. You are always enough. You don't ever have to pretend to be anything other than what you are. \" her marriage to acting teacher david legrant ended in divorce. Cook is survived by son adam legrant.",

        "summary": "With scandal swirling around donald trump, do the democrats have a chance at retaking control of the house of representatives? an analysis at the cook political report finds that it's still quite a long shot to think that democrats could manage the 30-seat gain they'd need. David wasserman lays out a multitude of reasons why this is, but the numbers speak for themselves: there are only 37 competitive house races, and six of those are seats already held by democrats. Of the rest, 18 are \" toss up \" states and 13 are \" lean republican \" states. Even assuming the gop maintains its majority in the house, questions are also swirling about what will become of paul ryan — like, for example, if hillary clinton wins the presidency, will he even want to run for what could be a \" miserable \" term as speaker? more reading on both subjects: cnbc concurs that winning back control of the house wouldn't be easy for democrats, but argues that the hope of doing so \" isn't so far-fetched. \" politico lays out the plausible scenarios for ryan's future. One of them: if he does run for speaker again, he could have a hard time getting enough votes. There's also the chance, albeit slim, he could quit congress entirely. The washington post, however, talks to an assortment of insiders for a story suggesting that ryan and a hypothetical president clinton could find a way to work together. Ryan himself spoke friday in madison, wis., against that hypothetical president, the wisconsin state journal reports. He did not mention trump by name once, but decried democrats ' \" hubris \" and focused on republicans maintaining control of the senate. Speaking of the senate, bloomberg notes that though it's an easier shot than the house ( a net gain of four seats is needed ), it will still be challenging for democrats to retake that chamber.
