        "summary": "Ten thousand human bones excavated from germany's tollense valley over the last six years tell the story of a bronze age battle that's surprising archaeologists. The bones of more than 100 men, along with remains of five horses and various weapons, comprise the first evidence of trained warriors in large-scale warfare in northern europe more than 3,000 years ago, science magazine reports. \" for a long time we didn't really believe in war in [ bronze age european ] prehistory, \" says archaeologist svend hansen. Northern europeans back then were farmers and traders living on farmsteads without many neighbors, much like parts of agrarian europe today, experts say — so any fight was likely a local skirmish. But these bones, preserved by bogs in northern germany, show that thousands of men fought in a battle about 3,200 years ago and many came from hundreds of miles away. \" this is not a bunch of local idiots, \" said geneticist joachim burger after dna analysis revealed the warriors ' far-flung origins. \" it's a highly diverse population. \" some speculate that bands of warriors assembled to fight for a common cause, reports pri. So what were they fighting about? maybe one group pushed another back along a bridge or causeway thought to cross the valley at the time. It was also a tumultuous era, with the mycenaean civilization collapsing in greece, egypt battling \" sea people \" from distant lands, and northern europe soon becoming home to fortified settlements. \" tollense fits into a period when we have increased warfare everywhere, \" says an archaeologist in denmark. \" it could be the first evidence of a turning point in social organization and warfare in europe. \" ( meanwhile, a huge discovery about vikings just came from space. )",

            "About 3200 years ago, two armies clashed at a river crossing near the baltic sea. The confrontation can't be found in any history books — the written word didn't become common in these parts for another 2000 years — but this was no skirmish between local clans. Thousands of warriors came together in a brutal struggle, perhaps fought on a single day, using weapons crafted from wood, flint, and bronze, a metal that was then the height of military technology. Struggling to find solid footing on the banks of the tollense river, a narrow ribbon of water that flows through the marshes of northern germany toward the baltic sea, the armies fought hand-to-hand, maiming and killing with war clubs, spears, swords, and knives. Bronze- and flint-tipped arrows were loosed at close range, piercing skulls and lodging deep into the bones of young men. Horses belonging to high-ranking warriors crumpled into the muck, fatally speared. Not everyone stood their ground in the melee: some warriors broke and ran, and were struck down from behind. Author andrew curry discusses his story on a major bronze age battle on this podcast interview when the fighting was through, hundreds lay dead, littering the swampy valley. Some bodies were stripped of their valuables and left bobbing in shallow ponds; others sank to the bottom",
            "A deadly wave of arrows fell from the sky, opening the battle. Men screamed and fell, as the flint and bronze arrowheads struck deep into their bones. Some slipped from the bridge and sank beneath the river. Out of the mist, a wave of armored warriors — some on horseback — charged at their enemies, defending the ancient wood and stone causeway across the boggy valley. Warrior bands had come from all over europe, some of them from hundreds of miles away, and the campaign had brought them here, on this day, to fight to the death, for possession of this causeway. Now, thousands clashed. Hundreds would die. The two sides rained blows on each with wooden clubs and bronze swords, or stabbed with spears, tipped with flint or brass. One spearman thrust his weapon into the horse carrying a nobleman, sending horse and rider crashing off the bridge into the cold gray water. Finally, one side broke, and the losing warriors were chased down and cut down from behind. When the fighting was done, some men lay where they fell, only to be stripped of their clothes, weapons and valuables. Their mangled, naked bodies were tossed into the river.

According to smithsonian magazine, german prince georg ludwig married his first cousin, princess sophia dorothea, for political reasons. By all accounts, georg was a massive jerk, openly sleeping with other women and rubbing his favorite mistress in sophia's face. Enter philip christoph königsmarck. Philip and sophia would exchange 300 love letters over the course of their two-year illicit love affair. Until, it is suspected, a friend of theirs ratted them out to georg, according to a press release. Philip disappeared after a final nighttime visit to sophia at georg's castle in 1694. It's assumed georg had philip killed — and some of georg's men admitted to the murder — but the final resting place of philip's body has been a centuries-long mystery. There were reports it was thrown in a river or buried outside germany's leine castle, but it seems it may have been inside all along. A team repairing a section of the castle found a centuries-old skeleton in august. And while the skeleton didn't give any evidence as to a cause of death, researchers are working on extracting dna from it to compare to philip's living descendants. A positive match would mean a final chapter in one of history's great doomed love stories. ( another recently discovered skeleton may belong to a teen sacrificed to zeus. )",

Juan francisco lopez-sanchez, 45, is in jail and faces a murder charge for the shooting death of 31-year-old kate steinle, who was shot seemingly at random on a pedestrian pier wednesday. Turns out us immigration and customs enforcement was about to deport lopez-sanchez again in march, but gave him to the san francisco county sheriff over a drug-related warrant, says a source in federal law enforcement. That's when the story took an unexpected turn. The sheriff let lopez-sanchez go, saying he had already served his time for felony re-entry after deportation and had no outstanding warrants, ktvu reports. The sheriff also ignored ice's request to detain him and send a notice before freeing lopez-sanchez — because city officials see \" immigration detainers \" as violations of the right against unreasonable searches and seizures, according to the sheriff's legal counsel. Lopez-sanchez already has seven felony convictions, including four for drug offenses, and was on probation in texas. The sheriff \" didn't even need to hold him, \" the law enforcement source says. \" they simply could have notified that they were going to release him and we would have gotten him. \"",

The familiar grumman llvs now in service were built between 1987 and 1994. Upkeep for the aging vehicles has become a huge drain on usps resources, and with the trucks only getting around 10 miles to the gallon, the service spent almost $ 540 million on fuel alone in the last fiscal year, reports the wall street journal; the paper notes that general motors is among those chasing a contract for 180,000 \" next-generation \" vehicles expected to be worth around $ 5 billion. In a blog post, the usps describes fleet replacement as an opportunity to include modern safety and environmental features in its vehicles, as well as to address the huge growth in package delivery with new vehicle designs that \" could address the challenges of larger and irregularly shaped items. \" but the journal notes it's still unclear where the cash-strapped postal service is going to find $ 5 billion for a new fleet of vehicles when it has already reached its $ 15 billion credit limit with the treasury and lost more than $ 5 billion in the last fiscal year. ( alaskan subsidies alone have cost the service more than $ 2.5 billion over the last few decades. )",

            "What should the postal vehicle of the future look like? the u.s. Postal service recently put that question to its carriers and vehicle maintenance personnel and is currently reviewing the feedback. It's an important question because the delivery fleet is aging and the postal service needs to quickly replace it. In fact, our recent audit on the topic found the current fleet can only meet delivery needs through fiscal year 2017 – and that assumes no unexpected decrease in vehicle inventory or increase in the number of motorized routes. About 142,000 long-life vehicles ( llvs ) out of the 190,000-vehicle total delivery fleet are near or have exceeded their expected service life. Replacing these aging vehicles is daunting, particularly given the postal service's financial constraints. But fleet replacement isn't just a major challenge; it's also a big opportunity. Because the llvs are up to 27 years old, they aren't as fuel efficient as newer models. They also lack many of the safety features now considered standard for vehicle fleets, such as back-up cameras, front airbags, and anti-lock brakes. The next generation of vehicles can incorporate the latest safety and environmental bells and whistles, which will protect employees, cut down on fuel costs, and help the postal service meet its sustainability goals. Also, given the growth in packages, new vehicle designs could address the challenges of larger and irregularly shaped items. The postal service has a short- and long-term vehicle fleet acquisition strategy, but we found the plan lacks details such as vehicle specifications and green technology features. Also, despite 3 years of effort, the plan has not been approved or fully funded due primarily to the postal service's lack of capital. Given the urgent need to upgrade the fleet, we are encouraging the postal service to make some incremental purchases while formalizing a more specific long-term plan for the next generation of llvs. What are your thoughts on future postal vehicles? what should they look like? what safety and environmental features or other technologies would you like the postal service to add?"

The discovery was soon verified by illinois-based amateur astronomer brian tieman and arizona-based canadian amateur astronomer jack newton.

The main point of the operation, which is now in its sixth day, \" is to send a very clear signal that sweden and its armed forces are acting and are ready to act when we think this kind of activity is violating our borders, \" the swedish military's supreme commander tells the local. \" our aim now is to force whatever it is up to the surface... With armed force, if necessary. \" but he admits that submarines are \" extremely difficult \" to find: the only time sweden captured a soviet sub during the cold war was when one ran aground near a major military base. The military says it's investigating two fresh sightings of the suspected vessel, reports reuters. The search is taking place among thousands of islands in the stockholm archipelago, and analysts say it has exposed a major decline in the swedish military's capabilities over the last couple of decades. \" it's been awhile since we conducted this type of operation, \" the military's chief of operations tells the ap. \" we are a bit rusty. \" at cnn, former nato supreme allied commander james stavridis notes that the rocky floor of the baltic makes submarines very hard to find and says that though sweden isn't a nato member, it is a \" strong partner \" and the alliance \" should offer to assist with other assets and help sort out the situation, especially if there is any possibility of a vessel in distress. \"",

Instead, she's one of scores of hatchimals customers frustrated by dud toys that have failed to hatch from their eggs as promised or have stopped working after a few hours of play, reports news10. As the daily dot reports, some even say the toy swears, though the company explains that hatchimals speak their own language of random sounds and are not cursing, per ctv news. Still, the toys do \" incorporate a high level of technology \" and \" may not perform as well as expected \" in some cases, a rep tells cnn, adding that the company is working to resolve issues and is \" reviewing each and every consumer inquiry. \" based on a wave of complaints on twitter, customers aren't so sure. When her nephew's egg didn't open, capeci says spin master told her to open it herself and send the company a photo. She says she did but hasn't gotten a reply. \" i ' m concerned that i ' m not even going to get a replacement at this point, \" she says. Several twitter users who've called to complain say they were left on hold for hours or told to call back later. One user even ordered a furby as a replacement, noting spin master was \" impossible to contact. \" spin master isn't alone in its holiday toy troubles. Users are also complaining that they receive constant error messages while playing with mattel's app- and voice-controlled barbie hello dreamhouse, which retails for $ 300, reports cnbc.

More than halfway through the 71-minute flight, the pilot made an announcement: \" we're going to turn and go back to o ' hare, \" one of the passengers recalls him saying to usa today. Another passenger says the pilot explained that the 76-seat embraer 175 aircraft was too big to land at chattanooga, which didn't make sense to her since she'd taken delta flights to the airport on the same type of plane. The regional flight, a united express flight operated by skywest airlines, is operated daily, but there had been a last-minute aircraft swap due to a mechanical issue. The points guy confirms chattanooga can indeed handle that size aircraft. The real problem apparently involved ground crew equipment for that particular plane. The 50 passengers aboard were back in chicago at 4: 29pm, and ultimately switched to a 50-seat bombardier crj 200 — the aircraft united typically uses for that flight. They ended up in chattanooga more than three hours late; at some point after the plane had already turned around, they received a text alert from united saying that due to \" unforeseen circumstances \" and an \" unusual situation, \" their flight would be delayed. A second text message explained that the chattanooga airport was \" unable to assist with ground operational requirements for your current aircraft type, \" and a skywest spokesperson says the embraer was \" just a different aircraft than typical for ground personnel there. \" passengers were refunded and given a $ 300 voucher for a future flight, and perhaps more importantly, they were also given cheez-its upon landing back in chicago.

Obama's comments about mr. Comey, broadcast early in the day as recent polls showed a tightening race, were striking for a president who has insisted he does not comment on f.b.i. Investigations. But mr. Obama appeared to be doing exactly that in implicitly criticizing mr. Comey's decision to send a vague letter last week to congress — and by extension, the public — informing lawmakers about a discovery of new emails related to mrs. Clinton's use of a",

The diver won gold at the 1984 and 1988 olympics, and though he didn't come out as gay until 1995 ( when he also revealed he was hiv-positive ), louganis has argued in the past that rumors of his sexual orientation kept him off wheaties boxes at the time ( a charge wheaties denies ). Now, after a chicago woman's petition, he's finally getting the honor, the chicago tribune reports. Julie sondgerath started the petition last summer after watching an hbo documentary on louganis; it eventually got more than 40,000 signatures, and on tuesday, general mills announced that louganis would appear on \" wheaties legends \" boxes, which will be in stores for three to six months starting in may. Swimmer janet evans and track and field star edwin moses will also be featured on the boxes, which are intended for athletes who have retired from competition. Sondgerath sent a link to her petition to louganis right after she started it, and he thanked her, but \" i think really he resigned himself to the fact it wasn't going to happen, \" sondgerath tells the tribune. ( general mills says the petition didn't directly impact its decision to feature louganis. ) \" back in ' 95, i wasn't expected to live very long because we thought of hiv-aids as a death sentence, \" louganis tells npr. \" so to be here today, now 56, the box means so much more to me than it would have then because i feel like i ' m being embraced as a whole person, not just for my athletic achievements. \"",

        "summary": "As crowds in cairo's tahrir square yesterday celebrated the election victory of abdel-fattah el-sissi, things turned ugly: mobs sexually assaulted at least five women, cnn reports. Graphic video of one attack shows a woman stripped and bloodied, facing continued attacks even as police take her to their vehicle. Seven men have been arrested following the video's appearance online, al arabiya reports. A security official tells afp the victim was a 19-year-old student. Those arrested were also accused of three additional cases of sexual harassment. The news comes days after egypt's outgoing president outlawed sexual harassment in the country for the first time, cnn notes. The attacks have prompted an outcry, not least from the \" i saw harassment \" campaign tracking sexual violence in the country: \" it is shameful that the security leaders of the ministry of interior did not take into account any security measures or plans to prevent such incidents, \" the campaign says in a statement. Local media is also under fire; one reporter describing harassment on the scene apologized after remarking, \" they are happy, huh? \" such an amused response isn't unusual, the new york times reports, and mob assaults aren't new in tahrir square ( cbs reporter lara logan was assaulted in 2011 ). A state-affiliated group, the national council of women, blames a conspiracy of \" unknown entities \" aiming to \" taint the image of ( egypt's ) democratic celebration. \"",

        "summary": "When william benjamin robinson arrived on the shores of what would ultimately become ontario, canada, in 1850, he made a deal on behalf of queen victoria: the indigenous communities currently living on the land would allow the crown access to more than 35,700 square miles of their land in exchange for hunting and fishing rights plus an annual payment equivalent to c$ 2 per person per year. That amount was raised to c$ 4 per person per year in 1874, but has otherwise remained unchanged. Now, 21 first nations — representing around 30,000 people — are suing the federal and ontario governments over a deal that, they say, has not been interpreted correctly, the guardian reports. Per the first nations, the robinson huron treaty actually promised that if the territory produced more revenue for the crown than the amount of the annuity, the annuity would be increased accordingly. And yet, today, \" despite the fact that trillions of dollars have been gained from the territory for the crown and for corporations, \" the annuity remains unchanged beyond its sole increase nearly 150 years ago, says one of the representative plaintiffs in the case. Some estimates put the amount of revenue from the land over the years at between c$ 500 million and c$ 1 billion. The plaintiffs want increased annuities in the future plus retroactive payments after a full accounting of profits has been presented. Per a press release last month, \" the trudeau government has said there is no relationship more important than the relationship with indigenous people and they have committed to working toward reconciliation with first nations people. In reality we have not seen those words put into action, \" chief duke peltier says. He told cbc at the time that many citizens wonder why their payments are just $ 4 when they hear of the profits made by multinational corporations operating within their territories.",

In september 2014 the robinson-huron treaty first nations launched a lawsuit against canada and ontario as a result of the failure to implement specific commitments of the robinson-huron treaty of 1850, specifically the annuity augmentation. The 1850 treaty committed the crown to provide treaty annuities as the lands produced revenue. This annuity was to increase as revenues increased, which would support the annuities without incurring a loss.

        "summary": "Males wooing women can get away with acting a little creepy if they're good-looking, but the homely ones are out of luck, suggests a new study out of eastern kentucky university. To gauge their perceptions of men, researchers showed 170 female college students two male faces with similar features — one considered attractive, the other not so much — alongside two scenarios. In what the study in gender issues describes as a \" low violation \" scenario, the male asks to borrow a pen; in the \" high violation \" or \" disconcerting \" scenario, he suggests she try modeling and asks to take her photo. The women were then asked a series of questions, including whether they would comply; most said yes to the pen and no to the photo, regardless of how attractive the man was. But they also ranked each man as to how friendly, ambitious, mean, rude, and creepy ( and more ) he was. In the low-violation case, both men's personalities were perceived to be similar. But in the modeling scenario, \" the perceptions of the facially attractive male's personality were significantly less negative... Than the perceptions of ( the ) facially unattractive male's personality. \" as researcher jeremy gibson puts it, \" the unattractive male is tolerated up to a point; his unattractiveness is ok until he misbehaves. \" the researchers call it a \" double \" devil effect, science daily reports: the bad behavior and the unattractiveness combine, and the negative perception is magnified. This has real-world implications, says researcher jonathan gore. \" a man who stands trial has already shown himself to have violated social norms in one way or another. If he is also unattractive, the magnified devil effect... Could influence how negatively jurors view him and, as a result, the degree to which they believe him guilty of the crime. \" ( need help in the looks department? tilt your head. )",

On tuesday, a judge refused bail for the five teens, aged 15 to 17, who have all pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and other charges, reports cnn. Each is charged as an adult and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted. However, a lawyer for one of the teens says he expects \" a distinction once the evidence comes forward, \" per wnem. \" although the charges are all the same, the kids are all different \" and \" the actions that the kids may have become involved in are all different, \" he says. Police say they believe 17-year-old kyle anger was the one who threw the rock that killed construction worker kenneth white via blunt force trauma to the head and chest. However, they also say 20 other rocks were thrown from the overpass before a 6-pound rock crashed through the windshield of a vehicle in which white was passenger. White's fiance, now a single parent to the couple's 5-year-old son, says she hopes the teens are punished to the fullest extent of the law, per wjrt. \" i just hope they realize … how many lives they [ tore ] apart, and know that what they did was wrong, \" she says, adding her wish that the individual who threw the rock will be behind bars for life.",

Lawyers for michael cohen argued in court on monday that they could not identify hannity because he asked that his name not be disclosed in connection with an fbi seizure of cohen's files. But judge kimba wood made one of the lawyers identify him in open court after a prosecutor argued cohen wasn't being forthcoming about his law practice, reports the ap. Assistant us attorney tom mckay had specifically complained that cohen wouldn't disclose the identity of the third client cohen represented between 2017 and 2018 and described as a \" publicly prominent individual. \" it turned out to be hannity; the other two are trump and former rnc official elliott broidy. Cnbc reports the work cohen specifically did for hannity was not specified; bloomberg reports a gasp was heard in the courtroom when his name was given. Wall street journal reporter rebecca ballhaus had hannity's immediate reaction, tweeting: \" we have been friends a long time. I have sought legal advice from michael. \" he later released a statement saying cohen has never represented him, and that they've only had occasional and brief talks about \" legal questions about which i wanted his input and perspective, \" and that the topic was \" almost exclusively \" real estate. He says he \" did not ask michael cohen to bring this proceeding on my behalf \" and wanted to be left out of the proceeding; indeed, a source tells cnn hannity never asked cohen to assert attorney-client privilege. The names of cohen's clients are at issue because the lawyer has argued that materials seized in an fbi raid on his home and office are subject to that privilege. The search sought information on a variety of matters, including a $ 130,000 payment made to porn star stormy daniels; daniels was in the courtroom on monday for the arguments. Hannity and the source say his discussions with cohen have nothing to do with the government's investigation or any third parties.",

The ceo of ticket vendor tablelist tells rolling stone that a suit was warranted after it became clear \" those behind fyre festival weren't being square. \" despite these issues, however, the times says it has a recording of mcfarland meeting with employees may 2, saying they'd do another festival next year and that the media had \" sensationalized \" what happened.

Per anonymous fyre media staff who spoke to the times, new hires were given no forms to fill out and payment methods were inconsistent. Red flags also emerged during fyre fest planning, with contractors not getting paid, tickets sold before a location had been finalized, and mcfarland \" scrounging for funds. \" in the recording, ja rule can be heard replying to employees wondering if their company committed fraud: \" false advertising, maybe — not fraud. \" a statement from mcfarland says he wants to \" make this right, \" and one of ja rule's lawyers says it's \" simply not in his dna \" to rip anyone off.",

In theory, that could take months, depending on whether a formal investigation is launched, a chinese law expert tells the los angeles times. But the best bet is that liangelo ball, cody riley, and jalen hill will get a warning, maybe a fine, and be allowed to return to the us with their team this week, reports usa today, which talks to three other experts on the subject. The three players were accused of shoplifting sunglasses from a louis vuitton store near their hotel in hangzhou, then released on bail wednesday. Ball is the brother of los angeles lakers rookie lonzo ball. \"there's no question that if the central authorities tell the hangzhou authorities to handle the case a certain way, it will be handled that way, \" says a george washington university professor. \" that always makes things a bit more complicated, but in this case i think the complication is likely to work for the players, not against them. \" the arrests coincide with president trump's visit to china. The ucla team is in the country to play its season opener friday, though ball, riley, and hill will no longer be in the lineup. In the worst-case scenario, the players face possible prison time. \" he ' ll be fine, he ' ll be fine, \" ball's father, lavar, told reporters.

        "summary": "It was an eventful nba trade deadline for the cleveland cavaliers, to say the least. Lebron james'team traded away over half its roster within the span of an hour or so thursday. Deadspin runs down the deals: isaiah thomas and channing frye to the los angeles lakers, jae crowder and derrick rose to the utah jazz, iman shumpert to the sacramento kings, and dwyane wade to the miami heat. The cavs also offloaded two draft picks. In return, the team gets rodney hood from the jazz, george hill from the kings, and larry nance jr. And jordan clarkson from the lakers. That's a serious amount of roster churn for a team that — at least at the beginning of the season — was a favorite to return to the nba finals. The big name leaving the cavs is thomas, who the team got in a trade with the boston celtics for kyrie irving last summer, cleveland.com reports. Thomas was a star for the celtics last season but missed the first 36 games of this season with hip injuries and played poorly when he returned, setting career lows in field goal percentage and 3-point percentage. \" it's lebron's ball, and this clearly wasn't working... This is a good opportunity for isaiah, \" thomas ' agent says of the trade to the lakers. Los angeles fared better in the trade than cleveland, which didn't do much to increase its championship hopes, according to cbs sports.

The precocious daughter of will smith and jada pinkett smith is clad in jeans and a shirt, while arias is, at the very least, shirtless, and his lower half is underneath bedsheets in the black-and-white shot.

Most parents don't allow their 13-year-old daughters to bring boys into their bedrooms — let alone men — but will smith and jada pinkett smith are anything but typical.

Wheeler, who had become the epa's deputy administrator in april, took the helm of the agency over the summer after the \"controversial and ethically challenged \" scott pruitt resigned, usa today reports. Before becoming the permanent epa administrator, wheeler will need senate confirmation ( which he had for his previous deputy role at the epa ). \"mr. Wheeler must come before our committee so that members can look at his record as acting administrator objectively to see if any improvements have been made, \" sen. Tom carper, a democrat on the senate environmental public works committee said in a statement, per the hill. In nominating wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, trump would \"ensure a continued deregulatory push \" at the agency, per the washington post. The paper adds that, like pruitt before him, wheeler has a \"zeal to deregulate. \" in july he said that he \"will try to work to implement the president's agenda. \" so far, that effort has reportedly included proposals to reduce or repeal limits on co2 and methane pollution from power plants and oil and gas drillers, and rolling back vehicle fuel efficiency standards. \" putting a coal lobbyist like andrew wheeler in charge of the epa is like giving a thief the keys to a bank vault, \" sierra club executive director michael brune tells the hill.

        "summary": "You'd think the search for a solution to bleaching coral in the great barrier reef would have scientists looking down into the ocean, rather than up at the sky. But clouds could be key to combating warming ocean temperatures blamed for the bleaching, say australian researchers. They believe that \" brightening \" low-level clouds over the 1,400-mile stretch of coral reef — boosting their ability to reflect the sun's rays back into space — could \" cool the water a degree or two, which is enough to prevent most of the damage, \" daniel harrison of the university of sydney tells australia's abc news. It could work like this: salt particles from the ocean would be directed at the clouds, triggering more water droplets to form and thus creating larger, denser clouds. Cloud brightening was first proposed as a way to cool the planet some 30 years ago and one study claims it could offset the ensuing global warming if carbon dioxide doubled in the atmosphere, reports mit tech review. But though research is ongoing — one company has spent seven years developing a nozzle to shoot the salt spray — trials have been few and far between. Australian researchers — who stress the need to reduce carbon emissions — now hope to determine, through computer modeling, if cloud brightening on a small scale would make a real difference. And there's a lot riding on the research. \" cloud brightening is the only thing we've identified that's scalable, sensible, and relatively environmentally benign, \" harrison says.

The plan, in theory at least, promises to balance the budget through unprecedented cuts across the budget. It calls for turning this year's projected $ 700 billion deficit into a tiny $ 9 billion surplus by 2027. It would do so by slashing $ 5.4 trillion over the coming decade, including almost $ 500 billion from medicare, $ 1.5 trillion from medicaid and the obama health law, along with sweeping cuts to benefits such as federal employee pensions, food stamps, and tax credits for the working poor.

        "summary": "The chinese communist party is cracking down on people who are a little too enthusiastic about the man who led it to power in 1949. The firing of chongqing party chief bo xilai, who led a maoist revival, has been followed by a purge of websites promoting mao zedong-era songs and stories, along with ultra-leftist ideals. In chongqing, music has been banned from a park where retirees used to wave red flags and sing patriotic anthems, reports the los angeles times. Analysts see the firing of the charismatic bo and the crackdown on the revival he led as a rejection of individualistic politics, notes the wall street journal. China's leadership may also have been worried about the movement's opposition to privatization of the economy and other western-style reforms. \" the government is really more worried about the leftists than the pro-western activists because they are against the reform and opening up, \" an activist in guangdong province says.",

For more than two years, environmentalists have protested the project and been arrested in demonstrations against it around the country. But many republicans and oil industry executives, who support the pipeline because they say it creates jobs and increases supplies from a friendly source of oil, embraced the findings. Advertisement continue reading the main story the state department is expected to shortly release the results of an inspector general's investigation into the preparation of an earlier draft of the environmental impact report. The investigation was ordered after an environmental group obtained documents indicating that some consultants for the firm that wrote the draft report had previously done work for transcanada, the company seeking to build the pipeline. If investigators determine a conflict of interest in the preparation of that draft, the state department may have to conduct a new environmental review. In light of the investigation, environmentalists were particularly critical"

        "summary": "Might women over 30 soon be saying goodbye to the pap smear? that's what some experts believe after a new study found that the hpv test detects precancerous cervical changes earlier and more accurately. The randomized, controlled study — the washington post calls it the \" gold standard \" of research — looked at 19,000 women over a period of 10 years. One group got the hpv test to screen for cervical cancer, nearly all cases of which are caused by hpv, the most common sexually transmitted infection. The other group was screened using pap cytology, the liquid-based test that has largely replaced the conventional pap smear in the us. The hpv test identified significantly more precancerous lesions earlier, and four years after the women were initially screened, they received both an hpv test and a pap test. Fewer cases of precancer were found in the hpv group, since that group had already had more precancerous signs identified and treated. But in recent years, most medical groups have been recommending women get both tests, and some experts are pointing out that such so-called \" co-testing \" may be better than the hpv test alone at detecting precancerous changes; the study did find that in a small number of cases, pap cytology identified precancerous lesions that hpv testing did not. The us preventive services task force currently recommends a pap smear every three years or co-testing every five years for women age 30 and up, but it is considering changing that recommendation to just one test or the other, and this study could speed things along, npr reports. Pap smears will still be recommended for women under 30, since hpv is so common that many in that age range would test positive for an infection that will end up resolving on its own. Whether medical recommendations change or not, a woman's experience with her doctor definitely won't, nbc news reports, because both both tests are administered via smear in the doctor's office.",

She had served 10 months of her sentence at the time, the los angeles times reports.

Police say hayman eventually admitted her true identity; she now faces extradition to michigan. Her neighbor says hayman was paranoid and lived a quiet, private life, but her son ( who wouldn't say whether he knew about his mother's double life ) says she often attended church and pta meetings. An officer says a 32-year-old son who was at his mother's house when she was arrested seemed \" quite surprised \" at the revelation, the san diego union-tribune reports.

        "summary": "On friday, the united auto workers union lost what had been hyped as a make-or-break vote for the future of the labor movement, as volkswagen workers in chattanooga, tenn., rejected a company-backed plan to unionize. Why did that happen, and what does it mean for unions? here's what people are saying: it is first and foremost the story of how \" outside influence \" affected the election, argues richard wolff in a post on bill moyers'site. \" organizations of business, the wealthy, and the conservatives … work constantly to shape workers ' life experiences and thus how they see the world. \" that made public opinion a fertile ground when outside groups started buying anti-union billboards. It's always been this way though: in the 1930s, communist groups did the same on the pro-union side. That played a factor, agrees jon healey at the la times, but \" the fundamental problem is that the pitch itself wasn't compelling. \" vw already paid its workers well, so what did they have to gain? uaw pitched it as a way to give workers a voice in company policy and make the entire company run more smoothly. \" right. And workers are supposed to pay for that privilege? \" \" many folks in chattanooga see the uaw as modern-day carpet baggers, \" observes peter morici at the detroit free press. The union strongly supports the democratic party, and with it liberal causes like abortion rights and gun control that \" are an anathema to many southern blue-collar workers. \" many also blame the union for bringing down detroit. The uaw needs to \" give up on most social causes that have nothing to do with their members ' wages and work environment. \" vw supported the effort because it likes the \" workers ' council \" model germany's ig metall union fosters. \" but the uaw is a very different sort of beast, \" and workers knew it, the national review argues. It hobbled detroit's automakers with \" with ridiculous and cumbersome work rules, \" and it's so corrupt that workers can't actually trust it to look out for them. \" the ladies and gentlemen in tennessee are backing the right horse here. \"",

But it turns out active-duty personnel aren't much more likely to disapprove. Instead, they're more likely to say they have no opinion, by as many as 11 percentage points. Gallup speculates that could be because they are \" adhering to a general nonpartisan norm within the military culture, and are therefore less willing to express an opinion. \"",

Passenger jerome barson, 78, died june 22 from his injuries, and his wife, linda, who was driving, suffered multiple injuries. The family sued williams for negligence for causing the accident.

The video shows that william has to stop in the intersection when a dark sedan makes a left turn in front of her. Williams then continues north just as linda barson's light turned green. Barson's hyundai sedan proceeds westbound and hits williams ' passenger side. Williams, 37, was not injured. Police say williams continued through the intersection \" in accordance \" with the law.

If berlin seems like an odd venue, well, \" these are the games of reconciliation, \" says alon meyer, president of maccabi germany. Olympic park, built for the xi olympiad in 1936, was at the time off-limits to most jewish athletes, reports nbc news, although jewish athlete endre kabos from hungary won the gold medal in both individual and team saber, while part-jewish fencer helene mayer was allowed to represent germany. Some jews have expressed disapproval of the games being in berlin, and a 25 % increase in anti-semitic crimes over the last year means increased security measures. After a memorial service today in the former sachsenhausen concentration camp, german president joachim gauck will kick off the games tomorrow in front of 15,000 people at the outdoor amphitheater waldbuehne, near the stadium where adolf hitler opened the 1936 games. This is the first time the maccabi games, formed in the late 1800s as a ban on jewish athletes grew widespread, are to be played in berlin. The games are not just a quest for the \" muscular jew, \" as meyer puts it, but an egalitarian honoring of athletes across generations and disciplines. Organizers are also trying for a non-sports record: what they hope will be the biggest shabbat party ever, slated for friday. ( the holocaust may have been far worse than previously thought. )",

And some analysts are worried, noting if the economy goes south, non-banks may find it hard to stay afloat without the deposits that banks count on. \" if defaults start to go up, they will literally run out of balance sheets, \" a kroll bond rating agency director tells the journal. And stanley middleman, ceo of freedom mortgage corp., the no. 3 non-bank lender, concedes \" our ability to borrow could become impaired \" if the economy tanks. But he also says things look good right now with low unemployment and rising property values, and quicken's chief economist points to having government backup. \" as long as there is a government guarantee, that is a powerful leveling factor that keeps the flow of funds going, \" he says. Investopedia notes that may be comforting for each individual lender — but could pose a \" systemic risk to the greater financial system \" if these lenders keep their hold on a large part of the mortgage network.

The worst epidemic of the virus on record has killed more than 8,400 people and infected some 21,200 in liberia, sierra leone and guinea since it was detected in march, according to who figures. More than 3,500 of the dead were from liberia. An explosion in infection in the capital monrovia in august caused international alarm, which grew after a liberian citizen, thomas duncan, carried the infection to the united states the following month. However, a massive international response -- including the deployment of hundreds of u.s. Troops -- plus a public awareness campaign helped and infection rates",

The generators hum; chlorinated water churns in brand-new containers; surveillance cameras send a live feed to a large-screen television. There's only one thing missing from this state-of-the-art ebola treatment center: ebola patients. The u.s. Military sent about 3,000 troops to west africa to build centers like this one in recent months. They were intended as a crucial safeguard against an epidemic that flared in unpredictable, deadly waves. But as the outbreak fades in liberia, it has become clear that the disease had already drastically subsided before the first american centers were completed. Several of the u.s.-built units haven't seen a single patient infected with ebola. It now appears that the alarming epidemiological predictions that in large part prompted the u.s. Aid effort here were far too bleak. Although future flare-ups of the disease are possible, the near-empty ebola centers tell the story of an aggressive american military and civilian response that occurred too late to help the bulk of the more than 8,300 liberians who became infected.

Monrovia liberia, one of the three west african countries worst hit by ebola, could be free of the virus by the end of next month after success in curbing transmission, the government said on thursday. \" there are 10 confirmed ebola cases as of the 12th of january 2015 in the whole of the country, \" deputy health minister tolbert nyenswah, who heads liberia's ebola taskforce, said. \"my projection is that, if we do everything possible, we can reach zero by the end of the february. \" liberia said this week that only two of the country's 15 counties still had ebola cases. The worst epidemic of the virus on record has killed more than 8,400 people and infected some 21,200 in liberia, sierra leone and guinea since it was detected in march, according to who figures. More than 3,500 of the dead were from liberia. An explosion in infection in the capital monrovia in august caused international alarm, which grew after a liberian citizen, thomas duncan, carried the infection to the united states the following month. However, a massive international response -- including the deployment of hundreds of u.s. Troops -- plus a public awareness campaign helped and infection rates",
            "Workers at an ebola treatment center relax jan. 10, 2015 in tubmanburg, liberia. The facility was built by the u.s. Military. ( whitney leaming/the washington post ) near the hillside shelter where dozens of men and women died of ebola, a row of green u.s. Military tents sit atop a vast expanse of imported gravel. The generators hum; chlorinated water churns in brand-new containers; surveillance cameras send a live feed to a large-screen television. There's only one thing missing from this state-of-the-art ebola treatment center: ebola patients. The u.s. Military sent about 3,000 troops to west africa to build centers like this one in recent months. They were intended as a crucial safeguard against an epidemic that flared in unpredictable, deadly waves. But as the outbreak fades in liberia, it has become clear that the disease had already drastically subsided before the first american centers were completed. Several of the u.s.-built units haven't seen a single patient infected with ebola. It now appears that the alarming epidemiological predictions that in large part prompted the u.s. Aid effort here were far too bleak. Although future flare-ups of the disease are possible, the near-empty ebola centers tell the story of an aggressive american military and civilian response that occurred too late to help the bulk of the more than 8,300 liberians who became infected.

Now, police have finally arrested a man accused of paige birgfeld's murder. Authorities say lester jones, 63, was a client of birgfeld, the ap reports. He allegedly killed her and burned her car, resulting in charges of murder, kidnapping, and arson. Dogs identified his scent in what was left of the car, and there was an unexplained gas can next to his desk at work, police say. A pampered chef food scale was allegedly in jones'toolbox; birgfeld worked for the company and may have tried to leave clues for police, police say. The local sheriff-elect notes a \" very circumstantial basis to this case, \" but he says the evidence is convincing, the denver post reports. How exactly birgfeld was killed remains a mystery. Her eight-year-old daughter reported her disappearance in 2007. Birgfeld's father wasn't aware of her escort work before her death. A former husband, however, apparently knew of it; he said she was the only employee of her business, models inc. According to another escort, jones nixed a planned meeting with birgfeld after realizing she'd previously been married to one of his fire department coworkers. \" my daughter was vivacious, knock-down good-looking, had a terrific smile, and was always optimistic, \" birgfeld's father tells the ap. \" she just seemed to think somehow, some way, she would manage through it all. \"",
