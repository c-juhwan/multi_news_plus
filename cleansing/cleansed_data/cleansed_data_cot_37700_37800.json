Their goal is to create a \" tsunami wave \" of pressure against bashar al-assad, stripping away his internal support, cnn reports. They also plan to deliver humanitarian aid, and to recognize the syrian opposition. Hundreds of assad supporters protested outside the conference, while syrian state-run tv called the gathered nations \" enemies of syria, \" according to the afp. Foreign help may not be entirely humanitarian, either; one opposition source at the meeting tells reuters that foreign powers are looking the other way as the free syrian army smuggles weapons into the country. \" it is coming from everywhere, including western countries, and it is not difficult to get anything through the borders, \" he said. Hillary clinton, who is at the meeting, said that the rebels would find weapons \" from somewhere, somehow, \" and that she would bet against assad remaining in power, msnbc reports.",

Garden workers and spectators alike have been waiting for the 12-year-old titan arum, a rare plant native to the rainforests of sumatra, indonesia, to finally open and emit its famous smell.

That typically occurs \" in its first decade or so of life, \" but last week's expected bloom time came and went; spike apparently didn't have enough energy to finish the job, so scientists had to help. Spike has become somewhat of a local celebrity, with nearly 60,000 visitors since it was put on public display aug. 6 after beginning to show the initial signs of blooming; another 250,000 or so have checked it out via webcam, eager to see what would have been the first corpse flower to bloom in the chicago area, wls reports.

Santorum's victories in colorado, minnesota and missouri. Mr. Santorum's sharp rise in the polls underscores some of mr. Romney's perceived weaknesses, with voters saying that mr. Santorum shares their values and that they connect to his blue-collar economic message. Polls can capture only a specific moment in time. To the extent that mr. Obama's improved standing is tied to the economy, it is tenuous. Grim economic news continues to trickle out of europe. Iranian saber rattling is increasing the sense of instability in the middle east. Even the white house warns that jobless numbers are as likely to rise in the coming months as they are to dip.

Beginning wednesday, the green bank telescope in west virginia will observe the mysterious cigar-shaped ' oumuamua across four radio transmission bands, from 1 to 12 ghz, as part of the breakthrough listen project searching for evidence of alien life, reports the guardian. ' oumuamua — hawaiian for \" a messenger from afar arriving first, \" per nasa — was first spotted by scientists in hawaii in october as it sped past earth at an astronomical stone's throw, per a release. It's now twice as far from earth as the sun and scheduled to pass through jupiter's orbit in may 2018, but close enough that the green bank telescope can detect even the faintest radio transmissions. ' oumuamua is estimated to be up to 10 times as long as it is wide, and the press release notes that researchers have theorized that an interstellar spacecraft would be of similar shape, so as to reduce friction and damage from space debris. While project adviser avi loeb of harvard acknowledges \" most likely it is of natural origin \" — it's widely believed to be an asteroid — he says that because of its curious shape, \" we would like to check if it has any sign of artificial origin, such as radio emissions. \" even if the green bank telescope fails to pick up any signal or other suggestion of \" extraterrestrial technology, \" all will not be for naught: the breakthrough listen project's work may reveal more about ' oumuamua's chemistry, including whether it carries signs of water.

The situation is especially dire for killer whales, the christian science monitor reports. \" we think there is a very high extinction risk for killer whales as a species in industrialized regions of europe, \" says paul jepson, who led a study on the effects of pcbs ( or polychlorinated biphenyls, which were widely used in plastics, paints, electrical equipment, and building materials before being banned ) on orcas, dolphins, and porpoises. Researchers took samples from 1,000 animals, the bbc reports, and found that pcb contamination persists at \" dangerously high levels. \" \" europe is a big big hotspot, \" jepson says, adding that pcbs seem to negatively affect breeding success and newborn calves. A nursing calf can end up ingesting up to 90 % of its mother's pcb contamination, jepson explains. West of scotland and ireland, he tells the bbc, there are only eight killer whales left, and they haven't produced a calf in many years: \" so that population will go extinct. \" another two pods of 36 orcas in southern europe suffer from low birthrates and are also at risk of extinction. \" and then, \" jepson says, \" that is it. \" europe produced about 300,000 tons of pcbs from 1954 to 1984. They were banned in the us in 1979, the uk in 1981, and the rest of europe in 1987. Researchers believe the toxic chemicals are leaching from landfills and ending up in the ocean, where they work their way up the food chain. Global policymakers, say researchers, must put new regulations on how materials containing pcbs are stored and disposed of.

O'reilly was due to return to the air on monday following a weekend report in the new york times that he and his employer had paid five women $ 13 million to settle allegations of sexual harassment or other inappropriate conduct by fox's ratings king. Meanwhile, the lawyer for another woman who says she was punished for rebuffing o'reilly's advances called on new york city's human rights commission to investigate o'reilly's behavior. A spokesman for the commission said no claim had yet been filed the new lawsuit against ailes was brought by fox's julie roginsky and is notable because it accuses fox's current management of trying to cover up for ailes. Roginsky said ailes, who lost his job last summer following sexual-harassment complaints he has denied, suggested she have sex with \" older, married, conservative men. \" she said ailes would insist upon a kiss hello at their meetings, requiring her to bend over so he could look down her dress. She was seeking a permanent role on fox's show the five. But after an april 2015 meeting at which she turned down ailes ' advances, he wouldn't meet with her again, and she never got the regular role, she said. Also monday, mercedes-benz said it's pulling ads from the o'reilly factor because of host bill o'reilly's sexual-harassment \" controversy. \" ( o'reilly brushed off the controversy over the weekend. )",

        "summary": "It's election day, and democrats ' chances of retaining control of the senate look pretty slim, according to election models at the washington post, the new york times, and fivethirtyeight, which put the chances of a gop victory at 96 %, 73 %, and 76 %, respectively. The post notes that all three election models agree that the gop is likely to pick up seats in arkansas, colorado, louisiana, montana, south dakota, and west virginia, while democrats will probably hang on to north carolina and new hampshire — leaving alaska, georgia, iowa, and kansas as the races to watch. Harry reid says the iowa race will be crucial for senate control, although there is a chance control may not be decided today, or even this month. More: mitt romney believes the polls this time around and he's confident about the gop's chances, the hill reports. This election is the \" last chance \" for voters to \" pass judgment, \" says romney, who has campaigned for republicans across the country but hasn't indicated he's planning a third bid for the presidency. Despite an economy that's slowly finding its stride, polls indicate voter interest is \" substantially lower \" than it was four years ago, with a populace worn down by isis and ebola, the times reports. Lackluster candidates comparing each other to taylor swift and clown cars haven't helped. Senate minority leader mitch mcconnell — heavily favored to win his race in kentucky — may soon be the body's majority leader, and he told a crowd last night that the rollback of president obama's policies will begin today, politico reports. \" these people need to be stopped and it starts tomorrow night, \" he said. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to limit their losses in an election that also stands to give the gop its biggest share of the house since it held 246 seats in 1946, the ap reports. Democratic incumbents are struggling in many of today's 36 gubernatorial contests as well, but the party holds out hope that a huge get-out-the-vote operation will save its senate majority. And if the republicans do usurp senate power? they ' ll have pulled off a \" spectacular feat, \" as npr puts it, with a victory despite their \" non-transformation \" — in other words, without changing a platform that was supposedly destined to doom them, like opposition to obamacare, gay marriage, and abortion rights. Democrats also hope that overzealous republicans, if they do take over, might actually work to their advantage ahead of the 2016 presidential",

            "Opinion if we act as if ' islam is the problem, ' we will guarantee that islam will become the problem. Army maj. Nidal malik hasan demonstrated many things when he allegedly committed treason in the war on terror. For starters, he showed -- gratuitously alas -- that evil is still thriving. He demonstrated that being a trained psychiatrist provides no immunity to ancient hatreds and religious fanaticism, nor does psychiatric training provide much acuity in spotting such things in others. For example, the london telegraph reports that, in what was supposed to be a medical lecture, hassan instead gave an hourlong briefing on the koran, explaining to colleagues at walter reed army medical center that nonbelievers should be beheaded, have boiling oil poured down their throats and set on fire.

            "Opinion if we act as if ' islam is the problem, ' we will guarantee that islam will become the problem. Army maj. Nidal malik hasan demonstrated many things when he allegedly committed treason in the war on terror. For starters, he showed -- gratuitously alas -- that evil is still thriving. He demonstrated that being a trained psychiatrist provides no immunity to ancient hatreds and religious fanaticism, nor does psychiatric training provide much acuity in spotting such things in others. For example, the london telegraph reports that, in what was supposed to be a medical lecture, hassan instead gave an hourlong briefing on the koran, explaining to colleagues at walter reed army medical center that nonbelievers should be beheaded, have boiling oil poured down their throats and set on fire.

            "The pailolo channel between maui and molokai is arguably one of the best downwind runs on earth. The lines are so true, and the wind direction so consistent, it allows for one of the most radical open-ocean paddling adventures in the hawaiian islands. But lest we ever forget, those winds are a giant life force unto themselves that we cannot begin to control. They're in charge. To wit, more than a decade ago now, pearl jam icon eddie vedder — a lover of ocean play himself — was paddling the channel on a six-man sailing canoe when the craft ran into trouble and overturned. The team stayed with the overturned canoe for hours before a broken mast apparently allowed the traditional vessel to right itself. Half the crew was able to scamper aboard. But they did so without paddles, and the wind immediately shot the vessel downwind and quickly out of reach of vedder and two female companions. Meanwhile, a young ashley baxter was riding on her father keith's boat, traveling the channel by pure coincidence, when she ran to her father in the captain's chair, swearing she heard voices out in the water. Keith trusted his daughter's instincts and they were able to find vedder and his friends, and swing back to locate the out-of-control sailing canoe and tow it back"

Unless things change, nearly half of california's salmon, steelhead, and trout species will disappear within the next 50 years and 74 % within the next century, say the scientists from the university of california, davis, in a news release. They cite an array of causes, including the broad one of climate change, but say other factors are at play — including thirsty marijuana crops thanks to legalization, reports npr. Chemicals used on food, wine, and marijuana crops are also polluting waterways, which become shallower as water is pumped out for irrigation. Meanwhile, dams are cutting off fish runs, per kcra, contributing to a precipitous drop in the number of coho salmon spawning in coastal streams over the last 75 years. Prized chinook salmon also are at risk. The report is a follow-up to one published in 2008 that found five of 31 genetically distinct fish species in california faced extinction within five decades. That figure has now risen to 14 species, with 23 on track to vanish by 2117, says lead author peter moyle, who calls the report \" an alarm bell. \" it shows \" we must act now, \" adds a rep for conservation group california trout, which contributed to the report. \" declining fish populations indicate degraded waters, which threaten the health and economic well-being of all californians. \" what to do? the report calls for the removal of some dams, the conservation of spring-fed streams, and the restoration of flood plains and coastal marshes, which serve as key food sources, reports the san francisco chronicle.",

What has been established, however, is that 95 % of infected sea stars perish. \" it's very serious, \" menge tells the weather network, and he zeroes in on one potential cause for alarm: \" some of the sea stars most heavily affected are keystone predators, \" which typically feast on the mussels that occupy oregon's low shores, preventing the mussels ' numbers from skyrocketing.

Stewart that got a quick avalanche of press, due in part to the fact that the publisher managed to keep the lid on the book for a year. The most dangerous animal of all is the result of stewart's 12-year search for his biological father, a quest launched when his birth mother made contact with him in 2002. As nola.com reports, jude gilford married best, then 27, when she was 13. The two fled san francisco, and gilford gave birth to stewart in 1963; best left him in a baton rouge apartment building when he was four weeks old. Best was ultimately jailed through july 1965 after facing charges of raping a minor and document and wire fraud. Gilford never spoke with him again ( interestingly, she ended up marrying a san francisco police department detective who worked on the zodiac killer case ). The zodiac killer first struck in northern california in 1968; best died in 1984. The 51-year-old stewart tells people that the book is the result of some 500 interviews and holds what he sees as evidence of his father's guilt: a similarity between his father's fingerprints and one left at the crime scene; a comparison of his father's handwriting from his parents ' marriage certificate with that of letters written by the killer that a handwriting expert found to be \" virtually \" the same; the victims'resemblance to gilford. Further, many of the zodiac killer's letters were directed to chronicle reporter paul avery, who had written critically of best after he married the teen. But there's one thing stewart hasn't been able to do: compare his dna to what the sfpd had among its evidence; he says he's unsuccessfully lobbied for such a comparison for a decade. A rep for the sfpd tells cnn the department had no knowledge of the book but will \" certainly... Take a look at \" it.",

Because heroin users build up a tolerance to the drug — which contributed to monteith's death — they have to use more in order to feel any effects. But after detoxing, addicts ' bodies can no longer handle those big amounts, and former addicts who relapse are likely to immediately revert back to the same big dose. That can kill them, one expert explains. As for the fatal dose of heroin, monteith was alone in his hotel room when he took it, vancouver police say, according to radar. His death is particularly tragic, one friend tells radar, in light of the fact that he previously kicked addictions to ecstasy and heroin. \" cory fought his demons and the demons won, \" another friend tells e!. \" cory wasn't going out and doing these things to have fun.

Latifa's sister, shamsa, had attempted a similar escape in 2000; it's still murky what happened to her after she was apparently recaptured. The guardian and a new bbc documentary detail latifa's escape attempt, which reportedly began with a letter she sent in 2011 to a former french navy officer who'd escaped dubai himself in the late ' 90s after some legal troubles there. A friend tells the bbc she was the one on the day of latifa's escape who drove the princess to oman, then helped her get to a yacht at sea via inflatable boat and jet ski. Days after that, the ship was raided and latifa disappeared; her instagram was shuttered soon after. \" if you are watching this video, it's not such a good thing, \" latifa says in the recording. \" either i ' m dead or i ' m in a very, very, very bad situation. \" in april, the guardian quoted a source said to be close to the dubai rulers who said latifa had been returned home, was \" with her family, \" and was \" doing excellent. \" ( human rights watch wants to know where latifa is. )",

            "Miami ( cnn ) president donald trump slammed former president barack obama's dealings with the communist regime in cuba on friday in miami, charting his own course of more confrontational relations with the castro-led government. The speech, which came as the president signed a directive outlining his posture toward cuba, is the latest attempt by the trump administration to chip away at obama's legacy. Obama spent the last two years of his presidency looking to warm relations with cuba, including a trip to the island in 2016. \" i am canceling the last administration's completely one-sided deal with cuba, \" trump said. Casting the obama administration as people who looked the other way on the castro regime's human rights violations, trump said that he, as president, will \" expose the crimes of the castro regime. \" \" they made a deal with a government that spread violence and instability in the region and nothing they got, think about it, nothing they got, they fought for everything and we just didn't fight hard enough, but now, those days are over, \" trump said. \" we now hold the cards. The previous administration's easing of restrictions of travel and trade does not help the cuban people. They only enrich the cuban regime. \" trump listed some of the",

As president donald trump is expected to announce... ( associated press ) miami ( ap ) — president donald trump declared friday he was restoring some travel and economic restrictions on cuba that were lifted as part of the obama administration's historic easing. He challenged the communist government of raul castro to negotiate a better deal for cubans and cuban-americans. Announcing the rollback of president barack obama's diplomatic opening during a speech in miami, trump said cuba had secured far too many concessions from the u.s. In the \" misguided \" deal but \" now those days are over. \" he said penalties on cuba would remain in place until its government releases political prisoners, stops abusing dissidents and respects freedom of expression. \" america has rejected the cuban people's oppressors, \" trump said in a crowded, sweltering auditorium. \" they are rejected officially today — rejected. \" though trump's announcement stops short of a full reversal of the cuba rapprochement, it targets the travel and economic engagement between the countries that has blossomed in the short time since relations were restored. The goal is to halt the flow of u.s. Cash to the country's military"

By 1919, the native hawaiian population had shrunk by more than 650,000 due to a century and a half of colonialism, the atlantic explained last year. That led to the passing of the hawaiian homes commission act of 1920, which set aside 200,000 acres of land for residents with at least 50 % native hawaiian blood. The holders of the new homeland leases could pass them down to their children and beyond — provided their descendants maintained at least 25 % native hawaiian blood. House bill 451 lowers the required level of native hawaiian blood to inherit a homeland lease to 3.125 %. Passed by the hawaiian legislature, it still needs to be signed by the governor and approved by the us congress. Fewer and fewer hawaiians meet the blood requirement, and thousands of people were set to lose their land, which would then be put up for sale to people with 50 % or more native hawaiian blood. While some argue the leases should be transferred to the thousands of native hawaiians who meet that qualification, lawmakers didn't want to see families displaced or their property fall apart without the motivating possibility of passing it down to their children, kitv reports.",

Previously, a lessee's child or grandchild with a blood quantum less than 1/4 hawaiian would be unable to inherit the lease.

Some takes: the book is \" a crackling read of grudges recalled, and settled, in her favor, a rewriting of the 2008 campaign that makes palin the heroine of every encounter, \" margaret carlson writes for bloomberg. The message appears to be that \" if only sarah could have been sarah, the course of history might have been different. \" going rogue is \" part cagey spin, part earnest autobiography, part payback hit job, \" michiko kakutani writes in the new york times. The second half \" often reads like a calculated attempt to position ms. Palin for 2012. \" the \" ever folksy, ever optimistic, weirdly ungrammatical \" palin tries to set the record straight about the 2008 campaign, mark kennedy writes for the ap. But though she says \" she was told to stick to a script and spout nonanswers, \" they \" remain unanswered in her book. \" bravo! writes palin booster john ziegler on mediaite. \" her candor goes way beyond typical political self-deprecation and into the realm of instructive human introspection, the type of which can only come from someone incredibly courageous, grounded, and self-aware. \"",

After all, i have far too much real information at my disposal ( like having actually spoken to her a few times ) to be taken very seriously in this day and age, unless of course i had something really bad to say about palin or her book. With that said, i was simply blown away by going rogue on almost every level. For many reasons, this is by far the best book and greatest literary achievement by a political figure in my lifetime.

After a 14-hour debate at a summit in brussels, leaders emerged with the outline of a plan to more swiftly create a single supervisory body to directly help banks. They also agreed not to prioritize this bailout debt ahead of any other creditors ' bonds — something that had been scaring off buyers, the wall street journal reports. Moreover, leaders agreed that bailout funds would come without austerity strings attached, provided the countries comply with eu budget rules — which, according to reuters, is a major concession from germany. \" the summit results offer no'silver bullet'to solve the euro crisis once and for all, \" one banker cautioned. \" it is another attempt to buy some extra time for the underlying fiscal repair. \" but investors were jubilant anyway, the journal reports, with yields plummeting on spanish and italian bonds.",

Under the \" sharia-inspired \" blood-money laws, relatives of victims have the power to forgive killers. Azeem admitted to drugging and strangling his sister on saturday because she \" brought dishonor on the family name. \" it was baloch's father who filed a police report against azeem and another son, muhammad aslam, after his daughter's death, reuters reports.

Also being investigated in the case is abdul qavi, according to reports. According to the guardian, baloch's mother says the prominent muslim cleric encouraged azeem.

Qavi has denied involvement and said he had \" forgiven her, \" though he also said her death should be an example to others who attempt to \" malign the clergy, \" per reuters. As for aslam, baloch's father says aslam encouraged his brother to kill their sister, but police are not commenting on his alleged role. According to reuters and the bbc, baloch's father told a local english-language newspaper that his daughter was the family's breadwinner: \" she was my son, not a daughter. I have lost my son.

Natalia molchanova was diving with friends for fun when she failed to resurface. The son of the 53-year-old russian diver believes his mother is dead after a three-day search involving divers, private boats, the coast guard, a helicopter, and an underwater robot failed to locate her. The diving community seems resigned to her death as well, notes the guardian. In her decades as a free diver, molchanova set 41 world records and won 23 world champion titles; she set her own record for deepest dive without fins in may, descending to approximately 233 feet. ( you can see a 30-second clip of it here. It's literally breathtaking. ) it's not clear what went wrong during her dive sunday, says a statement from her family and the global federation for free diving.

Instead, he says hitler sought out a conservative writer with no connection to the nazi party willing to put his name on it. Weber, who will be publishing his own book on the subject, says it shows hitler \" was a conniving political operator with a masterful understanding of political processes and narratives long before he drafted … mein kampf. \" von koerber, for his part, eventually broke with the nazis and spent time in a concentration camp.

The main issue is that republicans want to have their tax-overhaul plan on president trump's desk before the year is out. That would be dicey enough on its own, but the hill notes that lawmakers also need to resolve a dec. 8 deadline to avoid a government shutdown, with the issues of immigration and health care complicating all of the above. Details and developments: 6 problems: republicans can afford to lose only two gop votes in the senate on the tax plan, and axios counts six potential nays at the moment: john mccain, jeff flake, and bob corker, all of whom would seemingly relish snubbing trump; plus susan collins, ron johnson, and a new name in the mix, steve daines of montana. The push: the washington post reports on negotiations currently underway to win over the holdouts. Johnson and daines worry gop leaders the most, and both senators feel the current tax plan favors corporations over other, typically smaller, businesses. Tax breaks to help the latter could result, though the leaders would then have to find ways to offset that loss in revenue.",

In extreme disrepair since it ceased operations a dozen years ago, the brnenec textile factory had after what the telegraph describes as protracted negotiations been purchased by the endowment fund for the memorial of the shoah and oskar schindler. \" the goal is to build a true copy of the complex, \" foundation head jaroslav novak told ctk. But \" the money's not here yet, \" novak told pravo of the plan to turn the site into a holocaust memorial. \" that doesn't mean that it won't be. \" two months later, a slightly less hopeful picture. The guardian reports the renovation costs are estimated at $ 5.5 million, with some of that needed quickly for pressing roof repairs. The local regional authority has pledged funding. But the paper describes the fate of the factory — where schindler in 1944 relocated jews working at his krakow factory, claiming they were munitions experts vital to the nazi war effort — as being \" met with czech ambivalence. \" indeed, \" people are just not interested in it, \" novak tells the paper of the complex, which he describes as \" the only nazi concentration camp in the czech republic that is still standing in its original building. \" the guardian gives two reasons for the unimpassioned response: the complex relationship czechs have with the memory of schindler, who was himself a nazi party member known for drinking and womanizing, and prague's lack of a state-funded holocaust memorial of its own.

        "summary": "Now that the dc council has required walmart and other big-box retailers who want to do business in the city to pay a \" living wage \" of $ 12.50 an hour, mayor vincent gray has to decide whether to veto the measure. Walmart is threatening to pull the plug on three of six stores planned for dc if the bill goes through. Some of the pro-and-con arguments: veto it: dc will lose 900 retail jobs, 600 construction jobs, and much-needed stores selling fresh food in poor neighborhoods, write the editors at investor's business daily. \" and contrary to the leftist propaganda put out by unions and other supposedly ' progressive ' groups, walmart does not kill jobs; it creates them. \" the council move is \" anti-business, \" agrees the washington times, which is worried about lost tax revenue. Don't veto it: opponents of the living wage like to rehash \" myths \" about the \" dire economic consequences \" it will bring about, writes media matters, which cites several studies finding precisely the opposite to be true in cities that have one in place. ( that includes santa fe and san francisco. ) in the long run, it ends up helping business by reducing turnover and improving worker performance. It's complicated: \" the difficult thing about increasing minimum wages in dc, as opposed to a larger state, is that it's very easy for retailers to simply set up shop just outside the border in maryland and virginia, which means the district loses tax revenue and jobs, \" writes lydia depillis at the washington post. Yes, walmart has a general reputation for killing as many jobs as it creates, and for employing workers who still require public benefits. But the chain probably isn't bluffing about bailing on those three stores, and they're slated for neighborhoods that offer little else to residents. There's no denying the \" negative consequences \" for dc if they never appear.",

The city's south bank where these three institutions lie is in the middle of a land ownership lawsuit filed wednesday by a quebec first nation, ctv news reports. \" the algonquin anishinabe nation has never surrendered its title to the kichi sibi lands, \" the suit filed in ontario superior court reads. \" kichi sibi \" means \" great river \" in the algonquin language, and the complaint lists the real estate in contention as islands in the ottawa river, as well as the sections of its south bank and lebreton flats, land slated for development to possibly include an nhl arena. The suit names the national capital commission, the attorney general of canada, and ontario's ministry of the attorney general as defendants, per the cbc. The backstory involves the ontario algonquins, who raised quebec algonquins ' ire by signing an agreement in october with the ontario and federal governments that would eventually sign over to the aborigines nearly 14,000 square miles of land, including the ottawa valley section with parliament hill. But the quebec faction says it wasn't consulted on the $ 300-million-plus deal and that the ontario algonquins \" [ sold ] their soul to the devil for a handful of peanuts. \" the suit notes that even though various land agreements have been forged over the years, they always hinged on the band keeping possession of its land — an agreement it claims canada has flouted and profited from over the years. \" we're not against development but we want to be an equal partner. We have to be benefactors of that land, \" says kitigan zibi anishinabeg chief jean-guy whiteduck, per the ottawa citizen.",

In the nineteenth century, it was at the heart of the canadian logging industry. Before that, the ottawa river was a major travel route for explorers and fur traders. However, prior to the arrival of europeans, the region had witnessed thousands of years of native history. Kichi sibi, which means great river in the algonquin language, provides an overview of the ancient history of the ottawa valley using artifacts found in the region. Picnickers, hikers, farmers and avocational archaeologists found these objects over the past 150 years and donated them to museums. Their generosity, hard work and interest in preserving the past have given us a greater awareness of the valley's ancient history.

One of the newsier moments came when obama answered a tweet from john boehner, notes politico and mediaite. \"after embarking on a record spending binge that's left us deeper in debt, where are the jobs? \" tweeted boehner. \" obviously john is the speaker of the house, he is a republican and so this is a slightly skewed question, \" obama responded. \"what he is right about is that we have not seen fast enough job growth relative to the need. \" ( obama also joked about boehner's typing skills, but it looked to be a formatting glitch with an apostrophe that wasn't boehner's fault; the moderator misspoke and blamed boehner before correcting himself. )",

Eu ministers voted today to approve a plan to reapportion 120,000 migrants among member countries based on population and wealth, the new york times reports. The plan still needs to be ratified by eu leaders, who are meeting tomorrow, according to the wall street journal. Hungary — concerned about a \" muslim invasion, \" the times says — vehemently opposes the plan. \"the migrants are not just banging on our door; they are breaking it down, \" hungary's prime minister said yesterday, per newsweek and al jazeera america. \"hungary and the whole of europe is in danger. \" the plan would only deal with a small portion of the migrants — many of whom are from syria — arriving in europe every day. The bbc reports 500,000 migrants have arrived by sea so far, and germany expects at least 800,000 this year. The journal calls it the largest influx of migrants since the end of wwii. \"what we decided here today is an important building block, but not more, \" one german official says. Even countries not legally required to participate — including the united kingdom, ireland, norway, iceland, switzerland, and denmark — have agreed to help out. Meanwhile, the times reports hungary is strengthening its borders and allowing its army to use tear gas and rubber bullets on migrants.",

        "summary": "Pokémon go has proven to be a hit with players since it launched in the us, australia, and new zealand last week. The augmented reality smartphone game also is a \" certified financial hit, \" writes the atlantic. Need proof? just look at nintendo, which owns a 32 % stake in the pokémon company. Nintendo shares increased 25 % on monday — that translates to the addition of about $ 9 billion of market value for the company. And that, per the atlantic, \" signifies the potential there is for companies like nintendo, \" which may now use mobile gaming to resurrect ( and cash in on ) popular games from yesteryear, like mario and zelda. Here's more on the pokémon go phenomenon: the christian science monitor takes a closer look at whether pokémon go can save the once-great nintendo. This pokémon go guide from esquire provides \" everything you need to enslave, categorize, and battle cute magic animals. \" in another piece, the atlantic explores the mystery of pokémon go's maps: \" since its release, it's become unclear where the the geographical data that describes and defines those streets and landmarks is coming from, \" it notes. Buzzfeed reveals that pokémon go — \" the app taking over lives and actually forcing people to get off their couch \" — started in 2014 as an april fool's joke courtesy of google. Speaking of being a hit, pokémon go has far surpassed tinder in popularity, fortune reports. Vanity fair provides a roundup of metrics that demonstrate the game's status as an \" instant blockbuster. \" \" from graveyards ( and specific headstones ) to ' adult entertainment'shops, \" mashable takes us on a tour of some of the strangest poke stops. It's all fun and games until pokémon go players end up with \" broken feet, bruised shins, and twisted ankles, \" vocativ reports. Other players have had to be warned not to trespass. There's a lot of talk floating around about the app, which requests quite a bit of access to your google account, being a privacy nightmare. Lifehacker has a helpful guide for how to handle this potential problem. Even the westboro baptist church has gotten in on the phenomenon. Not in a good way.",

            "Ingram publishing/thinkstock images. Read slate's complete coverage of the trayvon martin case. Protesters held a \"million hoodie march \" in new york's union square on wednesday to advocate for the prosecution of george zimmerman, the florida man who killed teenager trayvon martin during a february neighborhood watch patrol. Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt on the night he was killed, and it may have led zimmerman to describe him as a \"real suspicious guy \" to a 911 operator. When did the hood become associated with troublemakers? at least 800 years ago. London was plagued by young, unsupervised apprentice boys during the 12th century. They were always rioting over some political or religious issue, and they often wore hoods to hide their identities. At the time, hoods were common among law-abiding folks as well, but they were especially emblematic of young hooligans. Advertisement the hood is a millennia-old accessory, and its long history has led to both positive and negative associations. Hoods can be a symbol of piety, honor, and respect. Ancient romans pulled part of their togas over their heads during prayer. People who have earned advanced degrees are \"hooded \" as part of the graduation ceremony. Cloistered catholic monks often wear hooded robes. But the hood is also associated with hiding one's identity for illicit purposes, and not"

        "summary": "When you don't get enough sleep, parts of your brain are going to take catnaps the next day, even while you're ostensibly up and awake, a new study suggests. The results can have real-world consequences, says lead researcher itzhak fried of ucla, who uses the example of a driver slow to pick up on a pedestrian. \" the very act of seeing the pedestrian slows down in the driver's overtired brain, \" he explains in a ucla release. In fact, it's very much as if the driver has had too much to drink. And while police have standard tests to measure for booze, \" no legal or medical standards exist for identifying overtired drivers on the road the same way we target drunk drivers, \" notes fried, whose study is in nature medicine. The research is based on a small sample — 12 people who had to forgo sleep for a whole night because of epilepsy surgery in the morning. But that still gave fried's team a unique opportunity to gauge brain function ( through memory tests and the like ) as the night wore on, per the telegraph. Electrodes gave them a sense of what was happening in the increasingly tired brain, and the researchers discovered that parts would essentially shut down and try to \" sleep, \" impairing function. While it's well-known that sleep deprivation harms cognitive function, the study is unique in showing what happens on the level of individual cells, notes forbes. And what happens isn't pretty. Whether such research might lead to new laws or policy is tough to say, but one thing is clear: \" when we're dragging after a night of lost sleep, now we know that it may be because our brain cells are feeling groggy and under-performing themselves, \" writes alice walton at forbes.

Described by rich smith at cityarts as \" a precious, lilting cadence \" marked by pauses \" where pauses need not go, \" the phenomenon of \" poet voice \" has now been cemented in science thanks to english professor marit j. Macarthur. After hearing monotony at poetry readings, macarthur and two colleagues at the csu bakersfield, compared 60-second recordings of 100 poets reading their own work with recordings of ohioans discussing current events and identified a clear difference, reports atlas obscura. In what macarthur classifies as \" monotonous incantation, \" the poets spoke more slowly — 33 % paused for at least 2 seconds at times — and in a narrower pitch range. An algorithm studied 12 factors in all. \" in a more natural conversational intonation pattern, you vary your pitch for emphasis depending on how you feel about something. In this style of poetry reading, those idiosyncrasies … get subordinated to this repetitive cadence, \" says macarthur. \" it doesn't matter what you're saying, you just say it in the same way. \" the study published in cultural analytics also examined differences among the poets themselves. It turns out that seven of the 10 most expressive readers were african-american females born before 1960, while five of the least expressive were african-american females born after 1960. That might suggest that modern poets, at least while reading in public, \" feel pressure to lean into certain aspects of poet voice in order to find success in a landscape dominated by white men, \" writes cairo giaimo at atlas obscura.",

The uk's institution of mechanical engineers estimates that between 1.3 billion and 2.2 billion tons of the 4.4 billion tons produced each year \" never reaches a human stomach. \" it lays the blame on a range of factors, from perfectly edible crops rejected by supermarkets because they fail to meet cosmetic appearance standards to overly strict sell-by dates, reports the guardian. America's love of couponing probably doesn't help, either: the report also targets sales that encourage consumers to buy multiples of a given product; the perishable ones often meet a trash-can fate. In the case of third-world and developing countries, inefficient harvesting and storage contribute to the figure. And waste begets waste: as much as 550 billion cubic meters of water is used on crops that end up in the trash. ( click to see the effect such waste has on your wallet. )",
