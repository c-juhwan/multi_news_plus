        "summary": "A 31-year-old enlisted service member who recently checked himself into the us navy's substance abuse rehabilitation program for alcohol addiction began suffering an entirely unexpected withdrawal during the 35-day program. It turns out that when the program stripped him of google glass, which he'd been wearing 18 hours a day for two months, he became irritable, had a hard time focusing, experienced his dreams as if through the narrow view of the headset, and repeatedly placed his index finger to the right side of his face as if trying to turn on glass, reports the guardian. The patient said that withdrawing from glass was \" much worse \" than withdrawing from alcohol. The navy doctor who saw the patient and wrote about his case in the journal addictive behaviors insists that though the american psychiatric association's latest version of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders doesn't include internet addiction, it exists. \" people used to believe alcoholism wasn't a problem, \" he says. \" it's just going to take awhile for us to realize that this is real. \" moreover, he says it will only become more prevalent as we continue to be more connected to our gadgets, and suggests that nomophobia ( fear of being without one's cellphone ) will also be on the rise. Google has not yet commented on the case, reports nbc news. ( earlier this year, google let anyone buy the headset for one day only, provided they could handle the price tag. )",

But he's still making music, and an album out this month is classic cohen in that it's \" obsessed with mortality, god-infused, yet funny, \" writes david remnick. The profile is much larger in scope, however, tracing the arc of the canadian-born cohen's life, including his time with muse marianne ihlen. And it includes a rare treat: the normally reticent bob dylan going into depth on why his friend cohen is so brilliant. \"when people talk about leonard, they fail to mention his melodies, which to me, along with his lyrics, are his greatest genius, \" says dylan. \" even the counterpoint lines — they give a celestial character and melodic lift to every one of his songs, \" he adds. \" as far as i know, no one else comes close to this in modern music. \" dylan, in fact, was one of the first to recognize the brilliance of cohen's much-covered hallelujah, the piece notes. As for cohen, he lives in la now, with money trouble involving a shady business manager now behind him, and he considers himself \" extremely blessed. \" he's free to focus on music and writing, though he doesn't expect to finish all the songs in his head. \" at a certain point, if you still have your marbles and are not faced with serious financial challenges, you have a chance to put your house in order, \" he says. \" putting your house in order, if you can do it, is one of the most comforting activities, and the benefits of it are incalculable. \" ( click for the full piece, in which remnick recounts getting lectured at length by cohen over a mixup on a meeting time. )",

            "Greensboro, n.c. — federal prosecutors closed their case against former sen. John edwards thursday afternoon with a direct play for the jury: showing the august 2008 national television interview in which he publicly acknowledged having an extramarital affair but boldly lied about its duration, whether he had fathered a child and whether he'd told his family the full truth.

        "summary": "The infamous murder case involving kennedy cousin michael skakel has just taken another, and perhaps final, turn. Connecticut's supreme court on friday vacated his murder conviction in the 1975 slaying of neighbor martha moxley, ruling 4-3 that his defense team did a lousy job representing him, reports the hartford courant. The newspaper thinks it's unlikely that state prosecutors will decide to retry skakel, who is a nephew of robert f. Kennedy's widow, ethel. Skakel served 11 years in prison after being convicted in 2002, but a lower court overturned his conviction in 2013, and he has been free since then as the case has wound through the courts, reports the ap. \"i was 43 when my daughter was murdered, and i ' m going to be 86 in 20 days, \" moxley's mother, dorothy, tells the boston herald. \" that's half of my life that has gone on, and i ' m willing to spend the rest of my life to find justice for martha. \" she remains convinced that skakel is the person who bludgeoned 15-year-old martha with a golf club and stabbed her in the neck. Skakel maintains that he was watching tv at the time of the murder, and the state supreme court faulted his defense attorney for failing to track down an alibi witness. One reason the decision is a surprise: the same court upheld the conviction by a 4-3 vote just 16 months ago and ruled that skakel should finish serving his 20-year sentence. Since then, however, the judge who wrote the majority opinion in that decision resigned, replaced by one who ruled in skakel's favor on friday.",

Acting on skakel's request that it reconsider an earlier decision against him, the court ruled 4-3 that skakel's trial lawyer was so ineffective that his right to a fair trial was violated. Remarkably, just 16 months ago, the court took the opposite position.

That's because su filindeu, which translates to \" the threads of god \" or \" god's yarns, \" is only made by three living women, descendants of a long line of women who for 300 years have passed down the family recipe, reports the bbc. One of them, paola abraini, is 62 and wakes at 7am every day to make the pasta. The recipe isn't secret, it's hard — so hard that no one else seems able to make it: celebrity chef jamie oliver gave up after trying for two hours this summer; engineers from pasta giant barilla couldn't get a machine to replicate it. Su filindeu consists of only three ingredients: durum wheat semolina, water, and salt. \" elasticity is fundamental, \" explains the slow food foundation, and this is achieved by patting the dough with salted or plain water. \" the exact moment when this should be done cannot be exactly defined, it is a sensation that only who is kneading can recognize, \" it explains. Sections of the dough are then stretched, using the fingers, eight times into angel-hair-like strands and layered on a flat basket called a fundu. The pasta is then sun-dried, and ultimately looks like \" tree bark, \" explain the pasta grannies in a video. It's prepared only one way: cooked in mutton stock with pecorino cheese added. \" i love it more each day, \" abraini says of the pasta. ( read another feel-good story involving pasta. )",

        "summary": "London police are investigating the death of a russian businessman as a murder after a postmortem examination suggested he may have been strangled by hand or ligature, the guardian reports. Nikolai glushkov was found dead monday in his london home after he failed to show up in court to defend himself against claims he stole $ 123 million from russia's state airline. The murder investigation is being led by the metropolitan police's counter-terrorism command. According to the bbc, police say there is no evidence connecting glushkov's death with the attempted murder via nerve agent of a former russian spy and his daughter the previous week. Meanwhile, russia says it's also investigating glushkov's death as a murder, the ap reports. The 68-year-old glushkov was a former deputy director of russian state airline aeroflot.

Mercer conducts its quality of living survey annually to help multinational companies and other employers compensate employees fairly when placing them on international assignments. Two common incentives include a quality-of-living allowance and a mobility premium. A quality-of-living or \"hardship \" allowance compensates for a decrease in the quality of living between home and host locations, whereas a mobility premium simply compensates for the inconvenience of being uprooted and having to work in another country. Mercer's quality of living reports provide valuable information and hardship premium recommendations for over 460 cities throughout the world, the ranking covers 223 of these cities. \"political instability, high",

        "summary": "Pedestrians in wheelchairs are a whopping 36 % more likely to die in a traffic collision compared to those out walking, according to a new study that's raising concerns about driver awareness and the availability of crosswalks. Researchers at georgetown university combed through news articles and data from the national highway traffic safety administration to identify 528 wheelchair-using pedestrians killed in collisions from 2006 to 2012, reports upi. Though about 5,000 pedestrians die in traffic collisions in the us each year, according to the department of transportation, researchers say pedestrians in wheelchairs have a much higher risk of death. The risk for male wheelchair users was five times higher than for female users, reports reuters, while male users aged 50 to 64 had a 75 % higher risk of death compared to walkers of the same age group. Researchers found no evidence that drivers tried to avoid a collision in 75 % of crashes involving wheelchair users. Nearly half of collisions occurred at intersections; in almost 20 % of those cases, there was no crosswalk available, and in nearly 40 % of those cases, there were no traffic controls, reports the university herald. This suggests \" pedestrian infrastructure \" is ill-suited to people with mobility impairments, study author john kraemer says. They may even be forced to use the street thanks to a lack of curb cuts allowing them to use the sidewalk. \" it is entirely possible that people who use wheelchairs may be at greater risk of death... Because drivers are less likely to see them, brake, and collide slower; because being lower to the ground wheelchair users may be hit more squarely; or because some people who use wheelchairs may have pre-existing medical vulnerabilities, \" he adds. \" understanding and describing risks are the first steps to reversing them. \" ( this is the deadliest day to be a pedestrian. )",

The first registry used data in nhtsa's fatality analysis reporting system ( fars ), a census of road crashes that occur on us public trafficways and produce at least one fatality within 30 days. Fars is based on police reports and fully described elsewhere.14 while fars seeks to fully capture fatal crashes, preliminary assessment of its data suggested incomplete ascertainment of wheelchair use, rendering it an incomplete source for identifying fatal crashes among pedestrians who use wheelchairs. A crash was included if a killed non-vehicle occupant was identified as 'restricted to a wheelchair ' or a motorised wheelchair rider",

So how did johnson get it so wrong at jcpenney after getting it so right at apple? doing away with sales events wasn't a winning strategy, and he lost the confidence of directors after he decided to reinvent the chain's stores without following the usual practice of testing changes first, the wall street journal reports.

The interstitium, a network of fluid-filled spaces, is found in tissues throughout the body, including below the surface of the skin and surrounding the digestive tract. The organ, described by time as a \" bubble wrap-like network, \" was detected with the help of modern laser endoscopes that allow researchers to analyze living tissue at a microscopic level. Previously, tissue samples were treated and put on slides before microscopic analysis, a process that caused fluids to drain away, collapsing the interstitium and making the samples seem like they were from a hard wall of connective tissue. In a study published in scientific reports, pathologist neal theise and colleagues describe what they say is a \" previously unrecognized, though widespread, macroscopic, fluid-filled space within and between tissues. \" theise, who used an endomicroscope to detect the network under the skin of his own nose after he was consulted about the patterns seen in endoscopies, says the interstitium contains about a fifth of the body's fluids. He says it seems to act as a \" shock absorber, \" but may also help cancer cells spread to the lymphatic system, the new scientist reports. \" once they get in, it's like they're on a water slide, \" he says. \" we have a new window on the mechanism of tumour spread. \" ( last year, the mesentery was identified as the body's 79th known organ. )",

        "summary": "The jungle book is enjoying something rarely granted to reboots: stellar reviews. Critics say the live-action remake of the disney cartoon based on the stories of rudyard kipling — in which a 10-year-old human raised by wolves sets out on a jungle adventure — is enchanting, giving it a 95 % rating on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: \" wow. Just, wow, \" writes randy cordova at the arizona republic. There's so much to love, from the incredible visual effects — \" it's often impossible to tell where the cgi ends and the real animals begin \" — to neel sethi as a \" perfect \" mowgli. Bill murray as lazy bear baloo \" adds a cutting humor the movie may have been missing, \" cordova adds. \" it's truly a family film in that it entertains all ages; parents won't be checking their watches to see when things are going to wind up. \" disney's the jungle book \" is what this franchise-tentpole-universe-theme-park factory does best, \" writes david edelstein at vulture. \" it's dazzling — almost no one will dislike it, \" he adds. \" untethered by reality, its settings are huge, its cliffs and waterfalls like something out of james cameron's avatar. \" the film is realistic, however, in that \" the animals are savage, \" so \" little kids might be shaken up. Some grown-ups, too. \" ann hornaday agrees the film includes \" some genuinely terrifying fight sequences and a couple of potentially upsetting deaths, \" yet \" every inch of the jungle book pulses with life, grace, and authenticity. Even when this idyllic world turns ugly, it's a thing of rare beauty, \" she writes at the washington post. And in the end, \" the audience comes out whistling — in this case, with joy and quite a bit of awe. \" \" it's one of the few films in which the 3d enhancement is justified. Each scene captures the essence of each animal so vividly that children in the audience were reaching out to the screen to try to'touch'the fur, \" maricar estrella writes at dfw.com. Estrella says this \" enthralling blend of live action and cgi is officially the first big family hit of the season, \" even with christopher walken's somewhat \" ominous \" portrayal of king louie. Idris elba ( shere khan ) and scarlett johansson ( kaa ) also star. ( saw the movie and liked it? we have good news for you. )",

At this point, the netflix recommendation engine is pretty darn accurate -- it takes into account your own ratings as well as the viewing habits of those similar to you.

In an incident six years ago that the parent blogger is just now copping to publicly — he never told his wife until this week, either — gouveia explains how he set out to go shopping in frigid temperatures with his baby boy in the back seat. It was only when he got to the doors of the supermarket that he realized he had forgotten his shopping list in the car. \" oh, and one other thing, \" he writes. \" when i realized what else i had forgotten, i learned the true meaning of ' panic attack. ' i just stood there, paralyzed by a deeper fear than i have ever known. \" his kid was fine, and gouveia could rattle off plenty of excuses, but the bottom line is that he \" simply forgot \" about his son, who likely would have frozen to death if not for that missing shopping list. He suspects he's not alone in this kind of close call. The consumerist, meanwhile, has a list of tips for people who drive kids around — like, say, leaving your cell phone or wallet in the back seat, too. \" if it sounds like we're begging, it's because we are, \" writes mary beth quirk. \" every summer as the hot weather approaches, it's always a good idea to reissue the plea to parents and other caretakers to please, please, not leave children locked in cars with the windows up. \" click for her full post, or for gouveia's full post.",

The two-year review by the 19-member taskforce, ethics abandoned: medical professionalism and detainee abuse in the war on terror, supported by the institute on medicine as a profession ( imap ) and the open society foundations, says that the dod termed those involved in interrogation \" safety officers \" rather than doctors.

A dod spokesman confirmed that detainees who refused to eat were fed through nasogastric intubation, the insertion of a tube through the nose. \" we have a very specific mandate to keep the detainees alive, \" said lt.

        "summary": "A timeline released by las vegas police earlier this week led to concerns they didn't do enough to prevent the oct. 1 shooting that killed 58 people and forced the owners of mandalay bay to release a statement openly disputing the timeline, the ap reports. Metro police had said stephen paddock fired 200 rounds into the hotel hallway, injuring security guard jesus campos, at 9: 59pm — about six minutes before he opened fire on a music festival 32 floors below. Clark county sheriff joe lombardo says that timeline led to characterizations of the police response as \" incompetent, \" which \" absolutely offended \" him. And mgm resorts international released a statement thursday saying at most 40 seconds passed between when campos was shot and when paddock opened fire on festivalgoers, according to the las vegas sun. On friday, lombardo said a new timeline by police is \" not in conflict \" with the mgm statement, npr reports. He said campos was shot just about the same time paddock opened fire on the festival. The original 9: 59pm time was actually when campos found a barricaded door on the 32nd floor of mandalay bay, lombardo said. This is not the first time the timeline of the shooting has changed — officials originally said campos was shot after paddock started firing on the festival — and lombardo warned it could still change again. Lombardo also increased the number of injured from 489 to 546, with 45 still hospitalized. The biggest questions remain: what was paddock's motive and why did he stop shooting? lombardo said police arrived at paddock's room 12 minutes after he shot campos, but the festival was only under fire for 10 minutes.",

What researchers found: a gene known as pten can cause a number of different cancers, including breast, thyroid, and colon; and it turns out that some 10 % of kids with mutations in the gene have autism, the new york times reports. That's about 10 times the typical rate of autism occurrence. Autism also occurs in about half of kids with a genetic disorder known as tuberous sclerosis, which boosts brain and kidney cancer risk. Only an incredibly small proportion of kids with autism have these gene mutations, however ( forbes reports that about 1 % of people with autism have the pten mutation ). But the discovery has allowed researchers to alter the genetics of mice to mimic autism symptoms ( the times notes no animals get autism \" naturally \" ). That enabled them to test a drug that fights tuberous sclerosis-induced tumors on the mice. After observing promising results there, a clinical trial involving a similar drug and children who have autism and the tuberous sclerosis mutation has begun. The researchers hope the drug, called everolimus, will boost the children's mental abilities; the study is due to be finished by december of next year.

On the kitchen table was an empty coke can with a note leaning against it that said \" sorry, \" the albuquerque journal reports. Cops were able to swab down both the coke can and a flashlight ostensibly left behind by the suspect — and the dna retrieved from their efforts matched herrera's. Not helping his case is the fact that herrera was reportedly seen nine times selling jewelry at local pawn shops after the burglary, which happened last month. Herrera, now in county jail on residential burglary and larceny charges, allegedly made one other weird move before leaving: he went to the bathroom and didn't flush, police say.

            "Getty immigration white house readies immigration legal defense court and historical precedents eyed as bolstering case for unilateral action. The obama administration is readying its defense for what is expected to be a furious legal assault on executive actions on immigration, pointing to a slew of court precedents and historical actions by previous presidents to bolster its case. Administration lawyers have concluded that president barack obama has ample space to offer the sweeping deportation relief he plans to announce on thursday night based on its review of previous supreme court and lower court decisions, according to senior administration officials. The justice department also has a point-person in place to coordinate its response to the anticipated legal onslaught. Story continued below the two main arguments in defense of the executive actions: first, obama has broad discretion under the law to decide which immigrants are deported. Second, predecessors including bill clinton and george h.w. Bush have taken",

        "summary": "The severity of america's opioid epidemic was captured in a dire government report published tuesday. According to the report, released by the agency for healthcare research and quality, the rate of opioid-related emergency room visits nearly doubled between 2005 and 2014, increasing a whopping 99 %. The report also found the rate of opioid-related inpatient hospital stays increased 64 % during that time. All told, american hospitals reported 1.27 million opioid-related visits in 2014, about 3,500 per day. The report also states that women have closed the gender gap when it comes to opioid-related hospital visits. In 2005 the rate of male inpatient stays was considerably higher than the rate for women, but by 2014 the rate was the same, though men are still more likely to be treated in hospital emergency departments for opioid-related issues. Though the opioid epidemic is a countrywide problem, the ahrq report finds that the problem is considerably worse in certain states. Maryland ranked at the top of the list of states for emergency visits in 2014, while massachusetts saw the most inpatient stays. The washington post reports that maryland is already suffering high rates of heroin and prescription-opioid overdoses. The number of opioid-related deaths in the state has nearly quadrupled since 2010 and the governor declared a state of emergency earlier this year. That increase can be blamed partially on the spread of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. One expert tells the huffington post the ahrq data comes as \" no surprise, \" noting that overdose deaths are \" just the tip of the iceberg \" in the us. ( in 2016 drug overdoses became the leading cause of death for people under 50 in america. )",

A tennessee woman is suing nasa preemptively to keep a vial of what she believes is moon dust that was given to the family by neil armstrong. Filed in federal court, the suit is an attempt to prevent nasa — which says private citizens can't own lunar rocks or dust, though there is no law against it — from seizing the vial. An expert tested the dust and concluded it \" may have originated from lunar regolith, \" reports cincinnati.com. Laura murray cicco tells the washington post that armstrong gifted her the vial along with a hand-written note decades ago when she was 10. She found the vial five years ago while going through her parents ' belongings. Cicco says that armstrong and her father were both members of a secret society of male pilots and were friends, per fortune. The note, which has been authenticated, reads: \" to laura ann murray, best of luck — neil armstrong, apollo 11. \" cicco is filing the suit because nasa has in the past seized suspected moon dust. When an elderly widow in california asked nasa to help her find a buyer for two paperweights containing tiny fragments of alleged moon rock that she says were given to her late husband by armstrong, nasa confronted and aggressively detained and questioned the woman in a sting operation. The woman was not charged, and she sued the agency in 2013 for wrongful seizure, wrongful detention, and other violations of her rights. Cicco's suit is aimed at avoiding that scenario. Nasa may view lunar material in private hands as stolen property, but cicco's attorney disagrees, telling the post, \" laura shouldn't be afraid that nasa is going to come knocking on her door and barge in and try and take the vial. \" ( in other moon-related news, buzz aldrin's moonwalk cost him $ 33. )",

That led to what the university calls a \" traffic jam \" in the spot where the two areas meet. The result was pressure and ion collisions, which led to a sound wave, popular science reports. The exterior of a star is home to plasma, which could lead to a similar situation. \" one of the few locations in nature where we believe this effect would occur is at the surface of stars, \" the york researcher says. \" when they are accumulating new material, stars could generate sound in a very similar manner. \" ( meanwhile, for the first time, a nasa spacecraft is orbiting a dwarf planet. )",

The notion that the stars, planets and galaxies resonate with a mystical symphony is a rather appealing one. If you've ever been curious about how this music would sound, i'd invite you to watch and listen to the wheel of stars. Jim bumgardner, a software engineer specializing in visualizations who consults out of his home in los angeles, created this visualizer that utilizes data from the hipparcos mission. The program puts the stars in the sky to an ethereal music of their own making. As he describes on the site: to make this, i downloaded public data from hipparcos, a satellite launched by the european space agency in 1989 that accurately measured over a hundred thousand stars. The data i downloaded contains position, parallax, magnitude, and color information, among other things.

According to tmz, which first reported the story, ford was driving in santa paula, on route 126, when a woman lost control of her vehicle and ran off the road into a small embankment. Ford was reportedly traveling behind her and immediately pulled over to lend assistance. He and a handful of bystanders rushed to the woman's assistance, tmz reported, and they managed to get her safely out of her car and keep the situation calm until paramedics arrived in the scene. The woman was reportedly taken to the emergency room with only minor injuries. It seems ford has trouble staying out of life-threatening situations, just like some of his silver screen characters. Previously, he's been the victim of a handful of plane and helicopter crashes, most notably in 2015, when the flight enthusiast suffered some serious injuries after engine trouble forced him to do an emergency landing on a golf course near the airport. More recently, he found himself directing traffic in new york city after, as entertainment tonight reported, cars started to get backed up exiting manhattan's midtown tunnel."

            "For many years, republican politicians chafing under the discipline of americans for tax reform's \"taxpayer protection pledge \" have said that they disagree with the organization's interpretation of it. Up until now, these complaints have seemed to me to be hollow. The pledge is fairly straightforward, and politicians who don't agree with it should not take it. The current situation seems to me to be different because taxes are scheduled to go up by quite a bit. If a deal brings taxes higher than their current level but leaves them lower than they would be if taxes rise as scheduled, would voting for that deal really constitute voting to raise taxes? norquist is taking the position that it would, but the letter of the pledge does not make that interpretation obviously correct. That interpretation would have perverse results, since in extremis it would mean that congressmen were duty-bound to let taxes rise a lot if the only practicable alternative were to have them rise a little. In 2011, atr itself took the more reasonable view that supporting a bill that allows some portion of a scheduled tax increase to take effect would not violate the pledge. ( follow the link, and you ' ll see that atr's \"clarification \" of its initial statement does not go against this reasonable view, instead dancing around it. )",

My mom was in the stands, she was like, ' marina sing, ' \" she recalled. Marina left her team line and picked up the mic, stunning everyone in the crowd.

A coach posted video of her rendition and it has since been shared more than 2,600 times, with 6,000 likes and hundreds of comments. Marina has major talent! we're glad to see her getting some recognition for it! video recorded by coach brian sandera",
            "San antonio - marina garcia thought it would be another night when she and her fellow volleyball players stepped onto the court. However, when the audio system went down just before playing the national anthem garcia did what came naturally to her: she sang. \" we were about to stand for the national anthem as we noticed that the cd wasn't working, \" garcia said. \" i didn't feel nervous. I felt like excited because i get to sing. \" unbeknownst to the high school senior someone was in the stands capturing the whole thing. At the end of the performance her teammates cheered, so too did everyone in the gym. \" i honestly couldn't ask for more. They all had smiles on their faces. Some of them teared up. Some of them had told me that they had the chills and just that feeling that i can give to people that emotion, that was so exciting, \" she said. Though",

Executive producer mark burnett says he is legally unable to release the tapes, and production company owner mgm says it's also legally restricted from releasing the material, though neither party responded to questions from the ap about the specific requirements blocking the release of footage. A roundup of developments: in a statement to cnn's brian stelter, burnett denies media reports that he is a trump supporter, saying he has \" consistently supported democratic campaigns. \" he also denies threatening to sue anybody who leaks tapes from the apprentice. Mashable reports that a group calling itself the \" trump sunlight campaign \" has started a gofundme page to raise $ 5.1 million to cover legal fees for anybody leaking trump material. Tv producer chris nee, who says the unreleased material includes trump saying the n-word, has claimed $ 5 million is the penalty for employees who leak material from the apprentice. The huffington post says it has obtained the transcript for some unaired moments in the apprentice's ninth season, in which trump criticizes the skin of musician emily west. \" i assume you're gonna leave this off, don't put this shit on the show, you know, \" he says. \" but her skin, her skin sucks, ok? i mean her skin, she needs some serious fuckin'dermatology. \" politico reports that clinton ally david brock says he ' ll pay the legal fees of anybody involved with the apprentice who leaks trump tapes in their possession. The daily show has tweeted a video clip from 2010 of trump firing contestant maria kanellis for using what he calls \" locker room \" talk. \" this is my boardroom.

Charles shields has concluded that lee is the author of an unsigned article about the notorious clutter family murders in kansas that appeared in the march 1960 issue of grapevine, a magazine for fbi professionals, reports the guardian. Lee and friend truman capote had been investigating the case, which would become the subject of capote's best-seller in cold blood. In the article, lee recounts the gory details of \" the most extraordinary murder case in the history of the state \" and gives particular focus to investigator alvin dewey of the kansas bureau of investigation. His job \" was doubly hard \" because \" the late herbert clutter was a close personal friend. \" so why no byline? \" it was typical of harper lee to not try to crowd her friend truman, \" says shields. But the 1960 piece may have had ulterior motives, shields tells the atlanta journal-constitution. The piece is a \" little unctuous, \" and he suspects lee and capote were trying to stay in the good graces of dewey and the investigative team. Also, it was a sign to other writers to steer clear of the subject. \" they were putting stakes in the ground, making it clear,'this is our turf. ' \" shields uncovered the article while revising his 2006 biography mockingbird, when he came across a column in a kansas newspaper by lee's friend dolores hope in february 1960. She wrote that an article by the \" young writer \" lee on the clutter case would soon appear in grapevine, and she adds that lee's first novel was due out in the spring — \" advance reports say it is bound to be a success. \" the fbi is sold on shields'sleuthing: it will reprint the 1960 article by lee next month, with an intro from the biographer.",

Ambassador samantha power, who organized the meeting with chile's u.n. Envoy. \" this represents a small but historic step. \" diplomats said two of the 15 council members, chad and angola, did not attend the informal, closed meeting. Jessica stern, executive director of the international gay and lesbian human rights commission, told the council that courts established by the islamic state group in iraq and syria claim to have punished sodomy with stoning, firing squads and beheadings and by pushing men from tall buildings. Fear of the extremist group, which controls about a third of syria and iraq, has fueled violence by others against lgbt individuals, she said. Subhi nahas, a gay refugee from the syrian city of idlib, told the council that president bashar assad's government \" launched a campaign accusing all dissidents of being homosexuals"

Heading into this week, roberts faced a strong challenge from independent candidate greg orman and a lesser one from democratic candidate chad taylor. Yesterday, taylor declared that he was dropping out of the race, a move seen as bad news for roberts because polls show him losing a one-on-one matchup with orman. Taylor didn't explain his withdrawal, but the speculation is that democrats asked him to step down to increase the chances that roberts ( and thus the gop ) would lose the seat. Today, however, republican secretary of state kris kobach declared that taylor must remain in the race, reports the kansas city star. He cites a technicality, saying that taylor filled out his paperwork incorrectly by failing to declare that he would be \" incapable \" of serving, as state law specifies. ( taylor can't simply resubmit, because yesterday was the deadline to withdraw. ) democrats say kobach, who has endorsed roberts, is playing politics with the move, though it's unclear whether the party or taylor will file a formal legal challenge. \"this could well end up in court, and i don't have a good sense for how the courts would rule on this question, \" an election-law expert tells the newspaper. Given the stakes, this is no small matter, points out politico. \" the decision could undermine efforts to unseat roberts and potentially rewrite the narrative of the 2014 midterms. \"",

A month after the shooting, the wheelers spoke publicly with members of sandy hook promise, asking for action to prevent more violence. \"we are not done being the best possible parents we can be for ben, not by a very long measure, \" david wheeler said at the time. \"if there is something in our society that needs to be fixed, clearly healed or resolved, that resolution needs a point of origin. It needs parents. \" then, he posed the question to parents everywhere of what it is worth to them to keep their children safe. White house spokesman jay carney said obama believes the voices of newtown families have been critical to progress on gun control. When asked",

Francine wheeler, whose son ben was among the 26 victims of the connecticut school shooting, will deliver the radio address, said white house spokesman jay carney. \" nobody has a more important and powerful perspective on the issue than the families who have lost loved ones, \" carney said. Obama spoke of wheeler's anguish in a speech he made in hartford, conn., earlier this week as part of the white house push for the legislation. \" over the weekend, i heard francine wheeler, who lost her son ben that day, say that the four months since the tragedy might feel like a brief moment for some, but for her, it feels like it's been years since she saw ben, \" obama said in the connecticut speech. \" and she's determined not to let what happened that day just fade away.

The white house will use its executive authority in the effort against climate change, with the epa putting new rules forward this summer to be finalized next year, the new york times reports. The administration announced the new rules today, citing \" benefits for the climate, the economy, and public health, \" usa today adds. \" this is the biggest opportunity to curb climate change pollution that they haven't already seized, \" says an advocate with the natural resources defense council. But the plan is already drawing criticism from both climate change activists, who say it doesn't go far enough, as well as industry leaders. The plan largely targets new efforts at oil and gas production rather than existing ones, which means it \" misses 90 % of the methane pollution from the industry, \" says a clean air advocate. \" the administration is proposing to fight methane pollution with one hand tied behind its back. \" meanwhile, the industry says new rules could hurt the current boom.

            "As president obama tries to build an enduring legacy on climate change, he is finding that the biggest obstacle in his path may not be his many critics in congress or lawsuits from oil companies but the precarious state of the economy. That much was clear in the white house announcement wednesday of what it framed as an audacious effort to cut by nearly half the greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas production. Although the plan provoked predictable angry reactions from energy firms, it ultimately reflected an administration that is treading cautiously on its signature environmental cause, wary of disrupting — or even being perceived of disrupting — the boom in domestic energy extraction driving the economic recovery. Obama stopped well short of exercising his full authority under the clean air act. The long-awaited plan to cut methane emissions, a byproduct of oil and gas production, does not apply to most existing energy extraction facilities. Environmentalists quickly expressed disappointment with that exemption. They warned that it may preclude obama from making good on his pledge to reduce the nation's overall greenhouse gases to 17 % below where they were in 2005 within the next five years. The new york attorney general joined them in calling on the administration to push harder. Methane is among the most potent drivers of climate change. It accounted for nearly 10 % of the u.s.

Now, in response to broad dissatisfaction with the hidden bureaucracy directing lethal drone strikes, there is an interest in applying the model of the foreign intelligence surveillance act court — created by congress so that surveillance had to be justified to a federal judge — to the targeted killing of suspected terrorists, or at least of american suspects. \"we've gone from people scoffing at this to it becoming a fit subject for polite conversation, \" said robert m.

He said court approval for adding names to a counterterrorism kill list — at least for american citizens abroad — \"is no longer beyond the realm of political possibility. \" a drone court would face constitutional, political and practical obstacles, and might well prove unworkable, according to several legal scholars and terrorism experts.

The email archive, created by a private cyber security researcher, appears to contain messages shared by the left's anarcho-socialist activists during the strategic and daily tactical planning of the \"occupy wall street \" and broader \"occupy \" campaign this fall. Big government received a tip about the existence of the archive, and we were able to contact the individual who compiled and posted it. He will describe the archive, and how he obtained the emails, later this morning exclusively on big government. Through \"crowdsourcing, \" the media and the public will then be able to discover the truth behind the \"occupy \" movement. The archive includes emails, for example, from radical anarchist organizer lisa fithian, who was profiled earlier this week at big government, and who is one of the leading organizers behind the occupy movement. In one email, dated october 1, fithian applauds the launch of \"occupations \" throughout the country. She also highlights an acorn-style illegal home occupation in california, linking to a television news story that reveals the involvement of the alliance of californians for community empowerment ( acce ), which is apparently the reconstituted version of acorn in california.

At his retrial, the 23-year-old was found guilty on all eight counts: five counts of aggravated rape, two counts of aggravated sexual battery, and one count of unlawful photography, the tennessean reports. Vandenburg was found guilty early last year, but a mistrial was declared months later after it emerged that a juror failed to disclose that he had been raped, reports npr. Another ex-vanderbilt player, cory batey, was found guilty in april and two others are awaiting trial. Vandenburg was the only one who knew the victim before the rape. She testified that she had no memory of the hours after vandenburg gave her a drink. Video and images from cellphones revealed that he had carried her back to his dorm, where his teammates laughed, texted, and shot video as they sexually abused her, egged on by vandenburg. His defense — much like that of brock turner — blamed alcohol and campus culture. The ap reports that vandenburg, who appeared to be weeping as he was taken away after the verdict was read, faces a minimum of 15 years in prison with no parole.",

        "summary": "Six officers in philadelphia's narcotics field unit were among the biggest crooks in the city over a six-year period in which they used violence and threats to steal more than $ 500,000 in cash and drugs, according to a federal indictment. The 26-count indictment against the six men, who were arrested at their homes yesterday, includes charges of robbery, extortion, kidnapping, and drug dealing, cnn reports. The officers have been under suspicion for years: dozens of civil rights lawsuits against them are pending, and hundreds of cases they were involved in may now be dismissed. The feds were able to build a case against the men with the help of another former member of the unit who pleaded guilty to robbery and gun charges this year, sources tell the philadelphia inquirer. Prosecutors say the men doctored police reports to conceal their theft and brutalized suspects who resisted, dangling one over an 18th-floor balcony and keeping another hostage in a hotel room for days. The officers pleaded not guilty at an initial hearing yesterday and are being held without bond. \" my client is a good, decent family man, presumed innocent by law, \" an attorney for one of the officers tells the inquirer. \" these are merely accusations by a bunch of police-hating drug dealers. \" the special agent in charge of the fbi's philadelphia office says it doesn't matter who the victims were. \" that many of the victims were drug dealers, not boy scouts, is irrelevant, \" he says. \" this corrupt group chose to make their own rules.

            "Homeland security chief janet napolitano has officially clarified that the same-sex partners and spouses of u.s. Citizens are eligible for relief under the obama administration's new policy of putting a lower priority on certain deportation cases. The action was a response to a letter from congress led by house minority leader nancy pelosi, d-san francisco, and rep. Jerrold nadler, a new york democrat who for years has crusaded for immigration relief for same-sex couples. Heterosexual immigrant spouses of u.s. Citizens are allowed to apply for immigration rights that are denied to same-sex couples under the 1996 defense of marriage act. The most notorious case in the country was that of a san francisco couple, bradford wells and anthony john makk, above, who won relief only through pelosi's personal intervention. Steve ralls, spokesperson for immigration equality, a gay rights group, said this is \"one of the very first times lgbt families have been recognized within federal immigration policies. \" the group's executive director, rachel b. Tiven, called the move a \"huge step forward … until now, lgbt families and their lawyers had nothing to rely on but an oral promise that prosecutorial discretion would include all families.

Wants to protect that law — which was passed mostly at the company's request — so it's pushing back against state lawmakers who want to ease it a bit by allowing whiskey makers to reuse old barrels as part of the process, at a potential savings of $ 600 a pop. The proposed changes would also roll back the filtering requirements, the wall street journal reports, and brown-forman has gone so far as to say tennessee whiskey is \" under attack. \" the changes, lawmakers say, would make it easier for craft distilleries to sell their own versions of tennessee whiskey. It would also ensure that not all tennessee whiskey tastes exactly like jack daniel's, notes a lobbyist supporting the change. But brown-forman thinks the competitor that urged the move — diageo plc, which owns no. 2 tennessee whiskey brand george dickel but sells only about 1 % of what jack daniel's does — is attempting to \" dramatically diminish the quality and integrity \" of the state's whiskey, and, in the words of the journal, \" make it inferior to bourbon. \" in other jack daniel's news, the company is testing a cinnamon whiskey in tennessee, oregon, and pennsylvania next month, the lexington herald-leader reports.",

        "summary": "Mondays always feel longer, but that's not the only reason today may be dragging. Yes, it's the winter solstice, meaning northern hemisphere residents will be tilted as far from the sun as they will be all year — so it's also the shortest day and the longest night, usa today reports. Just how short a day? nine hours and 15 minutes of daylight on the east coast, per time. The solstice, which happens everywhere on earth at the same instant, will take place at 11: 48pm est, meaning some parts of the world — including stonehenge, where there are usually wild solstice celebrations — will experience the solstice on tuesday. In fact, due to the imprecise syncing of the solar year with the modern calendar, the winter solstice can actually take place anywhere between dec. 20 and dec. 23 ( though those two dates are rare ), the telegraph reports. That said, this kickoff of the north's astronomical winter ( and the southern hemisphere's summer ) isn't necessarily the coldest part of the year for those above the equator — as we learned when weather forecasters said this could be one of the warmest christmas weeks on record. Days will once again grow longer starting dec. 22, but earth will still lag behind and continue to lose heat at a faster rate than it's taking it in from the sun; cities in the us typically don't start to warm up on average until at least the end of january, per usa today.
