        "summary": "Unless fans of failed 1853 whig party gubernatorial candidate william waldo make a last stand, california will soon be getting a robin williams tunnel. A bill to rename the tunnel, which connects the golden gate bridge to marin county and was once part of the comedian's daily commute, sailed through the california assembly 76-0 yesterday, reports the san francisco chronicle. The tunnel is currently known as the waldo tunnel and has also been nicknamed the \" rainbow tunnel \" because of its painted archways, nbc bay area reports. The bill, which started out as an online petition, will now be considered by the state senate. The tunnel's rainbows \" personify robin in that he was so playful, fun, accessible, alive, and colorful \" and are also reminiscent of the suspenders he wore in mork and mindy, writes petition starter julie wainwright, who lived near williams in marin county. \" robin was a one-of-a-kind type of person, and i want him to be honored in an unconventional, everlasting, and beautiful way, \" she writes. ( williams made sure that you won't be seeing him as a tupac-style hologram for at least 25 years. )",

The tunnel's archways are painted in rainbow colors, which is why people sometimes call it the \" rainbow tunnel. \" williams was a long time resident of marin. The idea to rename the tunnel started with an online petition that received more than 60,000 signatures. Julie wainwright, who started the petition, explained the reason behind it through a brief message on change.org: \" to remember and honor the very important citizen and world renowned entertainer, robin williams, for the joy he brought to the world and to bring awareness to the silent illness that eventually took his life. \" waldo tunnel photo credit: change.org the tunnel is reportedly featured in the clint eastwood film \"dirty harry, \" the humphrey bogart film \"dark passage \" and also plays a part in williams ' 1999 film \"bicentennial man. \" williams died at his tiburon home last august at age 63, his death shocked family, friends and fans across the bay area and the world, drawing an outpouring of grief and tributes.

Lucas's stepmother, emily glass, has been arrested for obstruction and one count of interfering with a law enforcement officer, reports people. According to the wichita eagle, the badly decomposed body was under a bridge on a gravel road, about a quarter of a mile from the nearest house. Sheila medlam, a volunteer searcher, says she got a text message from a private investigator telling her, \" we found him at 5: 01. \" within hours of the discovery, about two dozen volunteer searchers went to where the body was found and stood vigil for him, per the eagle. The area where the body was found — near the town of sedgwick about 20 miles north of wichita — was close to where they had been searching. Glass, who has a one-year-old daughter, reported lucas missing from their rental home on feb. 17. The boy's father, jonathan hernandez, works out of state for long stretches and was away at the time, per abc. A few days after lucas'disappearance, the police arrested glass, 27, for endangerment — specifically, smoking three bowls of marijuana and then driving her daughter to a restaurant — but a jury found her not guilty. Court documents indicate that lucas was frequently seen with bruises, and after lucas was reported missing, friends and relatives came forward and said they thought he had been abused. A family friend who says she spoke with jonathan relayed a message from him: \" jonathan said thanks to all searchers and everybody \" who has supported the family and cared about lucas. The friend adds, \" just continue to pray for the family because they lost somebody they love. \"",

        "summary": "The man police say confessed to the shocking road-rage killing of a 4-year-old girl in albuquerque, nm, has a long history of criminal charges — including a previous road-rage incident involving a gun — but no history of convictions. In the previous incident, tony torrez allegedly pulled a gun on a man in a parking garage in 2006 and was charged after the gun went off during a struggle and his friend was injured, the albuquerque journal reports. The charges were dismissed after the victim and a witness failed to cooperate with prosecutors, which appears to be a common theme in nine cases involving torrez, including a 2008 incident where he allegedly pointed a gun at his girlfriend and asked her if she \" wanted to die, \" the journal reports. Kob reports that the only case where a charge against torrez stuck was a parking ticket. Torrez appeared in court thursday on several charges, including murder, child abuse resulting in death, and tampering with evidence, cnn reports. He's being held on $ 650,000 bond. Court documents revealed more details of the shooting that the judge called one of the \" most wanton and atrocious acts in the history of this city, \" per the journal. Alan garcia, father of 4-year-old lilly, told police that he was on his way to the grocery store on tuesday with his two children when a car crossed two lanes of traffic in front of him and blocked his exit. Garcia told police that he swore at the other driver, who shot at his truck several times, killing his daughter with at least one shot to the head. A gofundme page in honor of lilly has raised more than $ 70,000, reports kob.",

Wick, an assassin played by keanu reeves, embarks on a final mission but ends up with a $ 7 million bounty on his head. Here's what critics are saying: \" you would not expect a sequel to a keanu reeves shoot-em-up to be one of the more engrossing and beautiful films of the year, but hey, it's 2017 — there have been a lot of surprises, \" writes barry hertz at the globe and mail. Yes, there's a lot of blood, but it comes in some of the \" most artfully arranged shots in recent cinematic memory, \" with stunning locations as a backdrop. This \" is an eye-popping feast that defies genre expectations. \" stephanie zacharek credits much of the film's success to its leading man. The \" beautifully orchestrated \" violence is \" mostly semi-comical \" and reeves \" knows what's awful and what's funny about every scenario, cluing us in with an invisible wink, \" she write at time. \" the pleasures of john wick: chapter 2 may be even greater than those of its predecessor. \" unlike many sequels, \" chapter 2 justifies the existence of more wick without overstaying its welcome, \" writes david sims at the atlantic. Instead of trying to \" match the emotional heft of the original, \" the filmmakers focus on the violence and impressive \" worldbuilding, \" a \" fantastic decision, \" according to sims. Fans of the original will be happy to know chapter 2 also suggests another sequel is in store. It could have been awful, but chapter 2 is \" one of the most fun action pictures in recent memory \" partly due to its \" lighthearted tone \" and sense of humor, writes adam graham at detroit news. Reeves \" gives wick the charred soul that powers the film, \" but the supporting cast is just as good, with common delivering \" his best-yet screen performance, \" graham says. Overall, \" it's a wicked blast. \"",

Michigan live reports the jackpot is up to $ 800 million — an increase of $ 100 million in the past 24 hours. If the current pace of ticket sales continues, it should hit $ 1 billion by the drawing on saturday night. The previous high jackpot was $ 656 million for a megamillions game back in 2012, according to cnn. There have now been 18 straight powerball drawings without a winner, dating back to nov. 7. So is it worth buying a ticket? \" playing the lottery is a bad idea, financially speaking, \" time notes. But the value of a $ 2 powerball ticket can actually increase if the jackpot gets large enough, which makes buying one slightly less of a bad idea, mathematically speaking. According to time, in order for a powerball ticket to be worth more than the $ 2 it costs, the jackpot would have to hit $ 1.2 billion, taking into account federal taxes and the possibility of multiple winners. With an $ 800 million jackpot, the expected value of a $ 2 powerball ticket is currently a piddly $ 1.01. You should probably read the whole explainer to understand.",

The three-page letter, which being auctioned off next week, is addressed to capone's son, albert \" sonny \" capone.

The legendary brooklyn-born mobster, who ruled gangland chicago during prohibition, was charged with income tax evasion in 1931; he was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison, much of which he spent at alcatraz. He was released from prison in 1939; riddled with syphilis, he suffered a stroke and died in 1947 at age 48. Though the letter to his then-college-aged son is dated only \" jan 16th, \" experts say he likely wrote it in 1938, four years after he transferred to alcatraz. In a somewhat surprisingly cheerful tone, his letter describes the daily grind in prison, which capone tried to relieve by playing banjo and mandola. Capone ended the letter encouraging his son to stay strong: \" well sonny keep up your chin, and don't worry about your dear dad, and when again you [ are ] allowed a vacation, i want you and your dear mother to come here together, as i sure would love to see you. \" read more from the letter here.",

Less than an hour after the couple set up the page to solicit donations, mcclure allegedly sent a text message to a friend saying, \" the gas part is completely made up, but the guy isn't. I had to make something up to make people feel bad. \" police say they likely would have gotten away with the scheme had bobbitt not gone public with his claims that the couple had only given him $ 75,000; an investigation was launched after that.

Michael feinberg brought a prescription for eight of the little blue pills with five refills to cvs and asked that his insurance company not be billed for the purchase, explaining that he preferred to pay himself, reports the new york post. His lawsuit alleges that when his wife called a few days later to inquire about one of her own prescriptions, a cvs employee identified as \"aurula \" mentioned the viagra prescription, pointing out that it was not being covered by insurance. The disclosure, according to feinberg, has caused \"severe mental anguish, pain and suffering, \" per patch, as well as damage to his marriage, although court documents don't explain what exactly happened between the couple. Feinberg's suit accuses the pharmacy chain of violating his privacy rights under hipaa, a federal law that prohibits disclosure of confidential health care information without the patient's permission. He is seeking unspecified damages for emotional harm.

        "summary": "The world has a new octopus: meet the \" frilled giant pacific octopus, \" newly detected by a student at alaska pacific university working on his senior thesis, reports earther. The creature resembles the familiar giant pacific octopus, but nathan hollenback not only laid out some distinctive visual differences but took dna samples that proved it was indeed a new species. One easy giveaway is that the octopus, whose latin name is still pending, has two white spots in the front of its head, while its more common cousin has one. As its name suggests, the new octopus also has a frill along the length of its body. \"presumably, people have been catching these octopuses for years and no one ever noticed, \" says david scheel, hollenbeck's adviser. The pair presented their findings in the american malacological bulletin. Given that the giant pacific octopus is a \" master of deception, \" elijah wolfson at quartz thinks it's fitting that the new cousin has essentially been lurking undetected right under the noses of marine biologists for years. The gpo is known to inhabit a wide swath of the northern pacific, from the western us coast to the shores of japan, but the researchers for now estimate that the frilly new species has a smaller range, from juneau, alaska, to the bering sea. They also think it generally prefers deeper waters. News stories about the discovery suggest it's possible that we may someday come to view \" giant pacific octopus \" as more of an umbrella term that encompasses various species rather than one distinct species of its own. ( wales recently had an odd octopus invasion. )",

            "You wouldn't think a giant octopus could hide in plain sight for decades.

Now that we've been properly introduced to the new \"frilled giant octopus, \" we ' ll need to learn more about it to ensure its survival. This discovery isn't a total surprise. Scientists have suspected for decades that giant pacific octopus might be an \"umbrella name \" covering more than one species. In 2012, researchers from alaska pacific university and the us geological survey found a genetically distinct group of gpos in prince william sound.

The initial phase will include 150 square miles ( about the size of denver, the atlantic notes ) of development in cairo's outskirts, adding a new governmental center, universities, hospitals, and an international airport. Expansion would eventually reach 270 square miles and link up with the suez canal area, the ap notes. The cairo capital website has plenty about this \" momentous endeavour to build national spirit … and provide for long-term sustainable growth. \" khaled fahmy's take in the cairo observer, however, isn't quite so rosy.

Officials say security forces are battling militants who attacked a security training facility at karachi airport from two directions, the ap reports. All flights have been suspended and the military has rushed troops to the scene. The death toll from the earlier attack rose to at least 34 today when authorities found the bodies of seven workers who had been trapped in a cold storage facility that caught fire during the battle, cnn reports. Angry relatives accused security forces of abandoning the workers during their battle with militants, who intended to hijack a passenger plane. Before today's attack, the military said 25 militants were killed when \" nine terrorist hideouts \" were destroyed by airstrikes near the afghan border, reports reuters, which notes that it's not clear whether the strikes mark the start of an all-out offensive in retaliation for the airport attack.",

But, still, box trucks, campers, and other tall vehicles keep taking on the notoriously low railroad bridge at peabody and gregson streets in durham, nc. And they keep losing. The bridge has shaved the tops off of more than 100 vehicles since 2008, and jürgen henn has captured it all on video, the wall street journal reports. \" it can be pretty spectacular, \" he says. Henn works in a building near the bridge. After witnessing several accidents, he says, \" i figured i'd keep track of it for a while. \" he aimed a security camera at the bridge. Then added a second camera on a building across the street, along with an infrared camera to capture nighttime wrecks. Some of his videos have more than a million views, per the journal. You can buy \" crash art \" and t-shirts on his website. The bridge, which offers 11-feet-8-inches of clearance, was built about a century ago, according to henn. During the intervening decades, the journal notes, vehicles have gotten taller. Today, minimum vertical clearance for a bridge is 14 feet. Since 2008, there have been no fatalities due to the durham bridge and just one minor injury, the state transportation department tells the journal, but there has been a toll: more than $ 500,000 in vehicle damage. Each time the bridge is bashed — about once a month, henn says — inspectors check it for damage, according to an earlier report by wral. To curb crashes, the city installed a height sensor that triggers flashing lights when a truck is too high to clear the span. Since the accidents keep happening, the city is now connecting that sensor with a traffic light in hopes drivers who are forced to stop will eventually figure out that their best bet is to turn before slamming into the bridge.

        "summary": "Ueli steck, the famed swiss mountain climber who died in an accident near mount everest on sunday, almost died in very different circumstances the last time he was in the area. The 40-year-old \" swiss machine \" was one of three european climbers who fled to base camp after brawling with around 100 sherpas at more than 20,000 feet. Despite how the 2013 incident was portrayed, steck was no \" cultural imperialist, \" writes nick paumgarten in a tribute at the new yorker, though he was \" certainly hardheaded and single-minded, to the point of being relatively heedless of the opinions of others, be they sherpa or swiss. \" paumgarten describes steck as the most accomplished mountaineer of his generation. Paumgarten notes that last year, steck found the body of alex lowe — considered the best mountaineer of his generation when he was killed by an avalanche in 1999 — and the two \" are now forever linked, in the alpinists ' circle of death. \" authorities in nepal say steck fell more than 3,000 feet while climbing the 25,791-foot nuptse peak ahead of a planned attempt to scale everest on a route only successfully used once before, the new york times reports. British mountaineer sir chris bonington tells the bbc that steck was known for speed climbing, though he doesn't believe that put him at greater risk. \" the death rate among the very best mountaineers is very high, particularly in the himalayas, \" he says.",

The autopsy later showed that andrea miller, 28, was not pregnant, coroner's spokesman ed winter said. Prosecutors were waiting friday for the results of the police investigation. Greer said he shot miller twice as she fled his home and ran down an alley. Miller's alleged accomplice, gus adams, is facing murder, burglary, robbery and weapons charges. He was being held on bail of more than $ 1 million. The murder charge is possible because adams is accused of participating in a felcony that led to a death,"

She says she wants to know why they're so keen on the president's boyhood residence, built by his father. \" what do they want? \" she muses.

The owner of the realty group that closed the deal last week says the lucrativeness of such a transaction is the \" perfect example of why special properties are appropriately sold by auction, just like art is. \" meanwhile, in trump tower, a woman who owns an apartment there was fined $ 1,000 by the city for advertising her 30th-floor digs for rent through airbnb, quartz reports.

The trump campaign, meanwhile, has called on people in the storm's path to heed evacuation orders, and trump says the us should \" offer our assistance to help our island neighbors \" affected by the storm in haiti. The washington post reports that trump appears to be trying harder to stick to his advisers'script: his tweets have been restrained and he has said he doesn't plan on bringing up bill clinton's infidelity during sunday's debate. Politico reports that with a month to go and around $ 150 million to spend, clinton's campaign is planning an ad blitz like no other in battleground states. The hill looks at five things trump will need to do to win sunday's debate. They include learning from pence's performance — and not taking the bait every time there's a charge against him. The new york times and the washington post look at an episode from trump's past that could come back to haunt him in the debate: in 1991 he appeared before the house to successfully lobby for the restoration of tax breaks and loopholes for real estate developers that had been removed in ronald reagan's 1986 tax reform legislation.",

        "summary": "A spike lee tirade earlier this week on gentrification in new york city's black neighborhoods continues to resonate, with lee going on cnn last night to explain his expletive-laden rant. He's fine with new people moving into neighborhoods that were once mostly black and mostly poor, he says. \" my problem is that when you move into a neighborhood, have some respect for the history, for the culture. \" this all started tuesday night at an african-american history month event in his native brooklyn. As new york recounts, lee vented about the \" christopher columbus syndrome \" of rich white people moving in. \" you can't discover this! we been here. You can't just come and bogart. \" he also told the story of his jazz-musician dad who bought the family home in 1968, \" and the mother******* people moved in last year and called the cops on my father. He's not — he doesn't even play electric bass! it's acoustic! we bought the mother******* house in nineteen-sixty-mother*******-eight and now you call the cops? in 2013? get the f --- outta here! \" and that's just a small sample. In response, self-described white \" gentrifier \" joshua greenman called lee's remarks racially offensive in the daily news. \" the phenomenon he decries is mostly innocuous, inevitable and, in a diverse and economically dynamic city, healthy, \" writes greenman. At salon, mary elizabeth williams thinks lee's argument is complicated by his own vast wealth, and she also thinks he's simplifying a complicated issue. But, she adds, he's spot-on \" in his assertion that whoever you are, ' you can't just come in when people have a culture that's been laid down for generations, and you come in and now s --- gotta change because you're here?

While they have a right to their opinions, much of the publicity they're currently getting is thanks to a \" gop-run dog-and-pony show \" reminiscent of the swift boat campaign against john kerry, writes adam weinstein at gawker. For evidence, he points to the new york times, which spoke to several of these soldiers. The piece notes that the interviews were \" arranged by republican strategists. \" what's more, according to the pentagon, claims of deaths linked to the search for bergdahl aren't backed up by data. Both soldiers who spoke to the times say they don't want to get political. But when you're supporting a \" data-denying political missile \" by calling it \" a neutral account … you're'speaking on the political ' before you even you open your mouth, \" weinstein writes.

        "summary": "To the trio of railroad workers, the situation just seemed a bit off: while tending to track for norfolk southern in alabama on tuesday afternoon, they came upon a truck parked near the tracks. Inside was a sleeping man and a young girl — who turned out to be 4 years old, but was sitting in the front passenger seat. Alarmed, they called riverside authorities, and when police chief rick oliver came upon the scene, something seemed off to him, too: the girl was dressed in adult-sized clothes, reports al.com — pjs and a hoodie. As the girl was removed from the vehicle, the driver jumped back in and fled, making it to mississippi, where he was apprehended in lauderdale county. Police say the man is thomas lawton evans, 37, who was released from prison feb. 1 and had allegedly kidnapped the girl from johns island, sc. Heidi renae todd's disappearance was discovered tuesday, after the child's mother didn't collect two of her children from school, reports the post and courier. Police, alerted by the school, stopped by the home to check on her and found the woman badly beaten. Two of her five children were present and unharmed, but heidi was gone. The suspect was described by authorities only as an \" unwanted visitor, \" and police have not yet provided a motive for the attack or kidnapping. Heidi's mother is in \" reasonably fair condition under the circumstances, \" says charleston mayor john tecklenburg, who said she was slated for surgery; her husband was away with the coast guard during the time of the attack.",

Heidi renae todd, 4, was recovered in riverside. The girl - missing for more than 24 hours - was found about 4 p.m. In a wooded area off highway 78 near depot street.

The employees, mark burk and chris jackson, and a contractor, donnie pepper, were concerned about the safety of the child, and reported the information to the riverside fire department.

Mrs. Clinton said again on saturday that donations from wall street made up a small percentage of her contributions, then turned the question around by noting that mr. O ' malley had gladly raised money from wall street as head of the democratic governors association. There were a few such tense moments, but the disputes were tamer than those that have become routine on the republican debate stage, and were entirely on policy grounds. Mrs. Clinton criticized mr. Sanders for proposing expensive government programs without providing details of how to fund them. She estimated that his proposals to make health care and college free would require a 40 percent increase in federal spending, or $ 18 trillion to $ 20 trillion. \"i think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we propose, \" she said. \"which is why everything i propose, i explain exactly how i ' m",

Fearing drug cartels will kill him after a failed attempt to recruit him for his military background, 39-year-old miguel perez jr. Of chicago says an \" extreme fast \" is his only avenue after an appeals court denied his request to remain in the only home he's known since age 8, reports the chicago tribune. That decision last week stemmed from a conviction for delivering less than 100 grams of cocaine to an undercover officer in 2008, though prosecutors say a plea deal masked that the real amount was significantly more. Perez, who has two american children, argues he only got mixed up with drugs because of a ptsd diagnosis following two tours in afghanistan. Perez was also to undergo tests for a traumatic brain injury — wgn reports he was injured in an explosion — but was arrested before that could happen, per the tribune. After serving half of a 15-year sentence, he was summoned to immigration court, placed in the custody of customs officers, and taken to a detention center in wisconsin, where he's been for more than a year. \" the system has been killing me slowly, and now i ' m facing death if i ' m deported to mexico, so i would rather die in the country i fought for than in a place that's not my home, \" he tells cbs chicago of the hunger strike started wednesday. His lawyer has filed two stays, one arguing perez needs immediate medical attention, and another seeking retroactive citizenship dating to 2001, when perez joined the military.

        "summary": "Volvo made big headlines wednesday when it became the first traditional automaker to announce that all of its cars would be at least partially electric in 2019. The trend away from old-school engines may seem inevitable, but the wall street journal has a sobering stat for electric advocates: less than 1 % of the more than 17.5 million vehicles sold in the us last year were all-electric. That probably won't change unless gas prices rise, charging stations multiply, and government subsidies remain in place. Other developments: overhyped? the bbc notes that volvo promised a \" portfolio of electrified cars across its model range, embracing fully electric cars, plug-in hybrid cars, and mild-hybrid cars. \" that's a little vague. Hybrids still use combustion engines, so it's not all that clear just how \" electric \" the company will be in 2019. \" mild hybrids \" in particular are essentially standard cars whose engines get the occasional boost from an electric motor. Look out, tesla: still, this is a sign that tesla, which rolls out a more affordable all-electric model on friday, will face \" intense competition by next decade \" from legacy auto companies, writes a barclays analyst, per fortune. He lays out the reasons why, including hybrids sold by other automakers. ( tesla has lost $ 10 billion in valuation over the last two weeks, notes quartz. ) transition: hybrids may indeed be big sellers in the next five years or so, but don't expect the trend to last long term. The reason is simple: \" from a cost perspective, it's a bit daft to have both an electric motor and a combustion engine in the car, \" writes chris bryant at bloomberg. That tax credit: buyers of electric cars are likely counting on a $ 7,500 federal tax credit, but a post at electrek makes a key point: the credit starts being phased out once a particular automaker hits the 200,000-vehicle mark. For tesla, it's doubtful that would happen by the end of the year, but potential buyers will want to pay attention in 2018. China's role: an analyst at autotrader tells the washington post that chinese ownership of volvo likely played a big role in the shift. The chinese market is obviously huge, as are concerns there about air pollution. Us automakers: despite the caveats, volvo's move shows that the \" road ahead for carmakers looks increasingly electrified, \" writes jonathan berr at cbs money watch. That includes the big three in the us: gm has its $ 35,000 chevy bolt, ford has 13 new electric vehicles in the works,",

In this case, a woman had a three-month fling with a man named billy mccall in 2011, then realized she was pregnant after they broke things off, reports the oklahoman. She sent him a facebook message informing of the big news, gave birth in 2012, then immediately put the baby up for adoption. Mccall says he never saw the facebook post and learned about the baby only after it was born, explains courthouse news service. Lower courts declared that mccall's parental rights had been terminated, but the state supreme court disagreed. \" this court is unwilling to declare notice via facebook alone sufficient to meet the requirements of the due processes clauses of the united states and oklahoma constitutions, \" wrote a justice in the majority opinion, according to the wall street journal. A dissenting justice wondered why facebook should be considered different than other forms of communication — \" letters can remain unopened; and faxes can be lost \" — but no matter, the issue now goes back to the lower courts to determine whether mccall still has fatherly rights to the child. The toddler is now 2 years old and has been living with the same adoptive parents since birth. ( in other facebook legal news, parents might be responsible for their kids ' posts. )",

        "summary": "Vanity fair's new editor-in-chief has kicked off her tenure with a scandal. The magazine issued an apology wednesday, four days after a video mocking hillary clinton drew outrage on social media, per deadline. In it, six editors suggest new year's resolutions for the 2016 presidential candidate while holding glasses of champagne. They suggest clinton teach a class on alternate-nostril breathing and \" take more photos in the woods. \" but they also say she should abandon her \" james comey voodoo doll, \" and take up knitting or \" literally anything that will keep you from running again, \" despite the fact that clinton has stated she is done running for president. \" get someone on your tech staff to disable autofill on your iphone so that typing in ' f'doesn't become ' form exploratory committee for 2020, ' \" an editor quips. Though fox news sees the video as \" light-hearted and in good fun, \" erik wemple's interpretation of it as \" snarky and demeaning \" is more in line with social media users, who were quick to point out the sexist, ageist air, per the washington post. \" hey stop telling women what the f --- they should do or can do, \" tweeted patricia arquette. One clinton adviser even used the hashtag #cancelvanityfair, while another burned his copy of the magazine. An editor included in the video initially defended it, noting \" this wasn't a hillary hit piece \" and similar videos were made for other politicians, including president trump, per the huffington post. By wednesday, however, the magazine was trying to quash the backlash. The video \" was an attempt at humor and we regret that it missed the mark, \" a spokesperson said.",

She was pilloried for wearing \" racist jewelry \" after being photographed ( see image here ) wearing a blackamoor brooch to the luncheon. Nbc news explains the two-inch brooch features \" an antiquated depiction of a black figure that many contend exoticizes people of color. \" it notes dolce and gabbana dealt with similar accusations in 2012 after one of its models wore a pair of blackamoor earrings in a runway show.

            "Denmark's highest-ranking nazi, ss officer søren kam, has died in germany with an outstanding danish murder charge still pending. Kam, who was 93 years old, was wanted in denmark for the murder in 1943 of bt's former chief editor, carl henrik clemmensen. The crime occurred during world war ii. Kam admitted to the kidnapping and killing of the anti-nazi editor, but claimed he was pressured to shoot clemmensen and only did so after he was already dead. Historians say that the evidence suggests clemmensen was standing up and very much alive when kam pulled the trigger. Kam's accomplice in the crime was executed in denmark in 1946. Germany refused to extradite kam to denmark after he was granted german citizenship in 1956. The simon wiesenthal centre listed him as one of the 10 most wanted war criminals from the nazi era. A nazi to the end kam enlisted",
            "Germany continues to shelter a former ss officer who is wanted for murder and for his alleged role in the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi concentration camps. The daily telegraph has tracked down former ss-obersturmfuehrer søren kam to the peaceful suburbs of kempten im allgäu, a town about 75 miles from munich. Dr efraim zuroff, a veteran israeli nazi-hunter, will be in europe next week to mount \"operation last chance \", to bring men such as kam to justice and to expose the role of complacent german judicial authorities in continuing to provide alleged war criminals with safe havens. \"kam is on my list because in my estimation he is one of the top 10 nazis that could feasibly be brought to trial \" for war crimes, said dr zuroff, who is director of the simon wiesenthal centre in jerusalem. The 86-year-old dane is number eight on the list of 10 \"most wanted nazi",

The hero corps ( human exploitation rescue operative ) trains veterans in computer forensics, cnn reports. Participants then work as computer forensic analysts, scanning the computers and external hard drives of child pornography suspects. \" it's an opportunity for me to go after bad guys again, \" says former army ranger sgt. Tom block, who is among a recent class of 24 veterans who will undertake 11 weeks of training followed by 10 months of on-the-ground experience as part of a yearlong unpaid internship. Conceived in 2009 by nonprofit protect ( national association to protect children ), the hero program partners with homeland security and the us special operations command. Participants \" are truly individuals who have lost their mission on the battlefield, \" protect ceo j. Christian tells cnn. For them, the hero corps is an \" opportunity step back into that role, \" says christian, a former army ranger who fractured his spine during a mission in afghanistan. The stats are troubling: christian says the us leads the world in producing child pornography. In 2008, a study found, more than 300,000 individual computers were being used to traffic child pornography. And a study by the university of new hampshire found that more than half of people who possess or trade child pornography are \" hands-on offenders. \" that's why veterans like block want to be heros. \" hopefully i can get to them before they get to another child, \" he says. Injured by a suicide bomber in afghanistan in 2013, block wears a prosthetic eye that bears the shield of captain america. \" he doesn't like bullies, \" block says of the super hero. \" and neither do i. \"",

Tony abbott, who ousted liberal party leader malcolm turnbull in 2009, has now been ousted by turnbull, who will become australia's fourth prime minister in two years after a 54-44 party leadership vote, per the bbc. Turnbull had officially declared he would challenge abbott for the leadership today, noting abbott lacks \" economic leadership \" and would cause the coalition government to lose the next election since he's been falling behind in the polls. Foreign minister julie bishop, who backed turnbull's challenge, kept her role as party deputy by a 70-30 vote over defense minister kevin andrews. \" the prime ministership of this country is not a prize or a plaything to be demanded, \" abbott said before the vote, per the telegraph. \" it should be something which is earned by a vote of the australian people. \" after news of the challenge broke, australians began putting onions outside their doors in honor of abbott, who is known to eat the veggies like apples, per mashable. The hashtag #putyouronionsout began trending on twitter, with some remarking that it meant abbott's downfall as leader. Last year, people shared photos of cricket bats outside their doors using #putoutyourbats to pay tribute to late australian cricket player phillip hughes. To make matter worse for abbott, a reporter notes he ' ll miss out on the $ 600,000 per year prime minister pension. A prime minister must be in power for two years to get it; abbott managed one year, 361 days.",

Traveling to her native swat valley, the bbc offers a new window into malala's background and life story. The region launched boys'schools in 1922, and within a few years it offered girls'schools as well. Standing out from its neighbors, \" swat was proud of its record on education, \" says the grandson of former leaders. But in 2008, the taliban demanded that girls'schools shut down — or face danger. Despite the threat, malala blogged and made public appearances to describe her educational experience. \" i didn't want my future to be just sitting in a room and be imprisoned in my four walls and just cooking and giving birth to children, \" she tells the bbc, which gives a detailed account of the shooting and the risky surgery afterward. Now attending school in england, malala continues to face danger from the taliban. \" she accepted that she attacked islam, so we tried to kill her, and if we get another chance we will definitely kill her and that will make us feel proud, \" says a spokesman, per sky news.

Not one democrat said yes to the plan, the new york times reports. The gop plan for purging deficits by 2025 without raising taxes: slash $ 5.1 trillion in social \" safety net \" and other programs. What's going to rise amid the deep cuts is military funding, with a proposal to funnel about $ 38 billion over to a war-funding account. The senate now begins a spring recess, so come mid-april, the approved senate budget will need to be reconciled with the house budget that passed wednesday. The times notes it would be \" the first common congressional budget in a decade. \" while not legally binding or in need of obama's signature, the legislation informs spending limits for domestic and military programs, per the times, and lays the groundwork for future bills that seem destined for veto fights with the president, the ap notes. \" fortunately for the country, the republican budget will not become law, \" harry reid tells the times. Two gopers voted \" nay \" to the plan: presidential wannabes ted cruz and rand paul. As for the dozens of amendments that flew through the approval process, there were some conciliatory overtures from the republican side: they helped sail through amendments on social security and veteran benefits for same-sex couples, and 14 gopers voted to pass an amendment that calls for american workers to earn paid sick leave, reuters notes.",

The mobile applications consultant is currently running a social sharing experiment — he's letting people use his starbucks card to buy coffee, at no cost to them. Stark hit on the idea while researching mobile payments, which he believes are the wave of the future. He began allowing people to download a picture of his starbucks card's bar code and use it — on their smartphones, via a printout, even on their laptops — and he also asked people to pay it forward by helping to fund the card. The experiment picked up over the weekend, when it went viral; most of the $ 4,400 that had been spent on the card as of yesterday had been spent in the prior two days. Stark estimates $ 4,000 of that was funded by anonymous donations, since he hasn't put money on it in a while. \" all the money going through the card right now is the kindness of strangers, \" he tells the los angeles times. And though some have criticized him for \" [ giving ] away coffee to people with iphones, \" he sees it as \" giving people hope....

        "summary": "The zodiac killer who terrorized the san francisco bay area is still living in northern california, says a new book by a former state police officer. The zodiac is blamed for at least five slayings beginning in 1968. No one was arrested for the murders, and police stopped hunting for the killer 2004. Former highway patrol officer lyndon lafferty is convinced the zodiac is a 91-year-old alcoholic living in solano county, who lafferty refers to using a pseudonym because of safety concerns. His case is strong, indicates the san francisco chronicle, which received two dozen taunting letters from the zodiac during his bloody spree. Lafferty told the chronicle in an earlier interview that he discovered the suspect's name spelled out in the cyphers that marked the zodiac's letters to the newspapers. Lafferty helped investigate the case on the job after the murders, and says in his book, the zodiac killer cover up, that he developed solid leads linked to his suspect. The information was squelched by officials, however, including by a judge having an affair with the suspect's wife, says the former cop. Lafferty wrote the book with help from six other investigators, some of whom worked the case while it was unfolding. \"as god is my witness, my partners and i have always tried to share our material and our case with the proper authorities, but in the past 40 years the latter have ignored and stymied and stonewalled us again and again, \" lafferty writes. Police will only say that the case remains unsolved.",

            "It's been 40 years in the making, but ex-california highway patrol officer lyndon lafferty's book about the man he believes is the zodiac killer has been released. Lafferty's book — \"the zodiac killer cover-up, aka the silenced badge \" — uses a pseudonym for his suspect, but in 442 pages, he lays out quite the case. The man who fatally shot or stabbed five people in the bay area in 1968 and 1969, and who sent nearly two dozen cryptic, taunting letters to the chronicle and others until 1974, is a 91-year-old alcoholic living in solano county, lafferty writes. Lafferty calls his suspect george russell tucker, and he told the chronicle he didn't use the man's real name because of privacy and safety concerns. The 79-year-old ex-chp officer maintains he encountered the man in vallejo in 1970 and developed clues with the late solano county sheriff's sgt. Leslie lundblad, but that the case was squelched by power-brokers in the county — including a judge who was having an affair with the suspect's wife. Lafferty researched the book with the help of six fellow sleuths, including other law enforcement officers who investigated the zodiac case during its height, and he calls his group \"the mandamus seven. \" a mandamus is a writ issued by a court mandating an official",

The study found that if the obesity rate stays at the current level — 34 % — then some $ 550 billion in health care costs would be saved, reports the washington post. Earlier studies predicted that 51 % of americans would be obese by 2030, but no matter which is correct, \" we still have a very serious problem, \" the head of the cdc's obesity program says. The obesity rate among women has stayed flat, but other groups, including higher-income men, are continuing to put on weight, and more obese people are becoming severely obese, according to the study, which predicts that the aging of the population will probably nudge many overweight adults into the obese category, and obese people into severely obese. The study's authors say it's not clear whether the growth in obesity has slowed somewhat because of the success of public policy initiatives, or because the us is nearing the maximum level of obesity that a population can sustain, notes the los angeles times.",

The continued growth in obesity will be expensive, said cdc statisticians: additional spending on healthcare for americans who will join the ranks of the obese in the next 18 years was projected to reach $ 549.5 billion over the next two decades.

The cars derailed moments later. The train was operated by southwestern railroad and was carrying a form of iron that is not hazardous, according to operations manager for railroad chris grimes. The paper says the cause of the accident hadn't been determined. A state police spokesman did not immediately respond to associated press calls for additional comment. ___ information from: las cruces sun-news, http://www.lcsun-news.com"

        "summary": "The bmx world is shocked and mystified by the apparent suicide of dave mirra, one of the sport's biggest names. The 41-year-old, who was married with two children, was found in a truck in greenville, nc, on thursday afternoon, dead from what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the los angeles times reports. One of his final instagram posts was a photo of himself in a boxing ring, with the message: \" fight to win! we all have battles to fight. Never back down. Love you all. #diewithyourbootson, \" the new york daily news reports. Mirra — who was nearly killed by a drunk driver in 1993 — won a total of 24 x games medals, a record only broken by bob burnquist in 2013, the guardian notes. In recent years, he switched to competing in ironmans and triathlons. Mirra's death has brought many tributes. He called greenville home and \" was as humble a guy talking with kids on a street corner about bikes as he was in his element on the world stage, \" says mayor allen thomas. \" dave was nothing short of the most iconic bmx rider of all time and single-handedly inspired generations of riders to come, \" writes justin benthien at ridebmx magazine. \" it is with very heavy hearts that tonight we must say goodbye to the miracle boy. \" \" we ' ll never know exactly why, but that's not our place to question, \" adds ryan fudger. \" our job is to honor the guy that pushed the boundaries of bmx both on the bike and off of it and give our condolences to his family. Rest in peace, dave. \"",
