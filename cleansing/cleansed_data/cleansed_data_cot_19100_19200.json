        "summary": "Robert anderson, mortality statistics chief at the national center for health statistics says he's \" not prone to dramatic statements \" — but he thinks we should be \" really alarmed \" by the finding that americans ' life expectancy has gone down for the second year in a row. The average life expectancy went down 0.1 years to 78.6 years in 2016, the center says. This is the first time there have been two declines in a row since 1963 — when the smoking rate was near its peak and there was a wave of flu deaths — and researchers say the main cause is the increase in drug overdose deaths, the guardian reports. The center says more than 63,000 americans died from drug overdoses in 2016, with two-thirds of the overdoses involving opioids like heroin, fentanyl, and oxycodone, cnn reports. Last year, when the average life expectancy declined for the first time in 22 years, set a record for overdose deaths, but 2017 is on course to be even worse, meaning the us could see life expectancy fall for three years in a row for the first time since the spanish flu a century ago, anderson says. He says the figures are especially worrying because the life expectancy figures can be seen as a measure of the nation's overall health. Princeton university economist anne case tells npr that deaths from alcohol and suicide are also up. She believes the deaths may be linked to the decline in stable, well-paid jobs, which means \" people don't have the stability and a hope for the future that they might have had in the past. \" ( the opioid crisis has caused a \" tsunami \" of cases for the child welfare system. )",

One activist says as many as 41 have died, per cnn, though a thursday un statement only confirms one death. There's been no food delivery since mid-october, and reports, videos, and photos ( mostly still unconfirmed ) coming out of madaya portray a horrific scene of emaciated residents forced to eat cats and grass, with one rescue worker telling the post people have been dying every day. \" we were eating leaves and grass, but these days there are no more leaves because of the snow, \" hassan abu shadi told the paper via telephone. \" there is nothing left but salt and water. \" one rep from doctors without borders said in a statement that madaya has become \" an open-air prison, \" adding those who try to escape the town are wounded or killed by gunfire or land mines. Abu shadi points the finger at pro-assad hezbollah fighters, but hezbollah insists rebels are keeping people in madaya, per the post. The un, which has deemed the starvation reports \" credible, \" says government permission is required to send food to those in need, and thursday the group noted syria had given the ok to let aid convoys into madaya and two other besieged towns, cnn and the ap report. Meanwhile, madaya residents have taken to social media to plead for help and show photos of corpses. In one unconfirmed video cited by cnn, a man cries, \" what did we do? my children, they're dying.

The federal bureau of investigation took ron rockwell hansen, 58, into custody on saturday while he was on his way to the seattle-tacoma international airport to get a connecting flight to china. The department said he has been accused of trying to transmit national defense information to china and with receiving \"hundreds of thousands of dollars \" while acting illegally as an agent for the chinese government. Reuters could not immediately learn who may be representing hansen in the case. Speaking in beijing, chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said she did not have information on the case. \"but certainly of late there have been some issues between china and the united states. We think china and the u.s. Are two major countries and both sides should do more things that strengthen cooperation and mutual trust, \" hua told reporters. Hansen is the latest person in a string of former u.s. Intelligence officers to be swept up in criminal probes related to spying for the chinese. Earlier this year, former cia case officer jerry chun shing lee was indicted for conspiring to gather or deliver national defense information to china. Another former u.s.

( ap ) — a hunch from a retired detective helped lead police to a man suspected of shooting six people to death in the phoenix area, some of whom were connected to his divorce, authorities said after the assailant killed himself with officers closing in. A round-the-clock investigation that began late last week led police monday to an extended-stay hotel in suburban scottsdale where 56-year-old dwight lamon jones was staying. As officers approached, they heard gunfire and found his body. Jones ' victims included a well-known forensic psychiatrist who testified against him in court in 2010, two paralegals who worked for the law office that represented the suspect's wife, a marriage-and-divorce counselor who was apparently targeted in a case of mistaken identity and another man"

        "summary": "After that whole richard nixon thing, one might think american presidents would think twice about taping conversations, but we now have one more from the gipper: recordings of conversations between former president reagan and world leaders including margaret thatcher and bashar al-assad's father have finally been released, having been found in the white house situation room in 1987 amid the iran contra scandal. Author william doyle, who has a book on navy seals out this week, got his hands on the tapes last week — following a foia request he made back in 1996. \" the tapes stayed in the white house, classified and unheard by any outsiders, until they were labeled, boxed, and sent to the reagan library, where they remained classified, \" he tells the new york post. Reagan apparently made the recordings for accuracy's sake, given poor connections and the involvement of translators, but the tapes were often recorded over or just tossed, notes the post. But what survives is revealing: in one, reagan kept the elder assad, hafez, cooling his heels on the line while he took 13 minutes to finish up a horse ride. \" damascus is saying hurry up, what's going on? \" says assad's translator at one point. In another highlighted by the bbc, reagan apologizes to margaret thatcher for not giving her a head's up american troops were invading grenada. \" if i were there, margaret, \" he said, \" i'd throw my hat in the door before i came in \" — meaning, essentially, \" don't shoot. \" reagan explains the security concerns involved, thatcher says she understands and eventually excuses herself to go debate in the house of commons. Quips reagan: \" all right. Go get ' em, eat ' em alive. \"",

        "summary": "After keeping a constant eye on a clutch of eggs from a rare, subterranean salamander, biologists at postojna cave in slovenia have their reward. Two baby olms have hatched — something that has never been seen outside of a lab, the christian science monitor reports. It's a \" rare opportunity for science, \" the bbc notes, because olms, which eat about once a decade and are thought to live to 100, only reproduce every five to 10 years. ( not to mention that a clutch of 500 eggs may produce just two surviving adults, and a clutch laid in 2013 was eaten by another olm. ) \" but the challenges are far from over, \" a press release explains. The olms, which hatched in an aquarium in the cave, will have to be fed and their water will need to be replaced daily to prevent infection. A female olm laid 64 eggs starting in january; of those, 23 were viable. The first hatchling came on may 30, and the second emerged two days later. \" our first dragon literally shot itself out of the egg in a single attempt, \" the press release says. ( when people first saw them centuries ago, they believed olms were baby dragons, hence the nickname. They are also called \" human fish \" for their pale, pinkish color. ) nobody witnessed the first hatching, researcher saso weldt tells the bbc, but an infrared camera captured the event. \" we saw that one was missing, \" weldt says. \" then you rewind and suddenly you realize, something has happened. \" staff at postojna cave hope the rest of the eggs will hatch within weeks. Olms dwell in underground rivers and can grow to be a foot long. Charles darwin said their undeveloped eyes were an example of natural selection, per the bbc. ( scientists finally classified this \" monster \" as a vertebrate. )",

            "Scientists in slovenia have captured a cave olm, also known as a'dragon, ' giving birth on camera. Two olm salamanders have hatched in a cave in slovenia, and slovenia is loving it. Dragons are still the stuff of legend. But in slovenia, a bizarre, cave-dwelling olm salamander serves as a worthy, real-life stand-in. For the past four months, biologists have been closely watching a clutch of \" dragon \" eggs at the postojna cave in southwestern slovenia. No one had ever witnessed the birth of an olm outside of a lab until wednesday, when two baby olms emerged from their eggs, to researchers'delight. \" our first dragon literally shot itself out of the egg in a single attempt, \" postojna cave park, which operates the cave, said wednesday in a press release. The remarkable birth was caught on an infrared camera that biologists have been using to keep close tabs on the eggs throughout their incubation. \" we took care of the eggs non-stop, observing them, connecting scientific findings with our own experience.... We had to take decisions nobody had taken before. Everything was new, \" postojna cave park said in the announcement. Out of 64 eggs laid, only 23 appear to be viable. The first two hatched on wednesday at postojna cave in southwestern slovenia. The mother has been kept separate from her eggs for their safety, after the last clutch laid in the cave was lost entirely. The scientists are hoping to see more healthy larvae emerge soon. \" it is the end of one part of the story and the beginning of a whole new chapter: feeding and living without the egg, \" sašo weldt, a biologist at postojna cave park, told the bbc. Olms face much tougher odds for survival in the wild, where it's estimated that only one or two eggs might hatch out of a clutch of 250. Olms have only previously been observed emerging from their eggs in the lab. Olms can live to 100 and only lay eggs twice every ten years. They tend to live in deep caves throughout the balkans, largely inaccessible to human researchers. They were first documented in the 17th century by local slovenians who mistook the bizarre creature for a baby dragon."

Per cbs news, the woman, identified in reports as natasha aponte, used the dating app tinder to convince the men to meet her for what they thought was a one-on-one rendezvous in manhattan's union square. But, according to one twitter user who claims he was among natasha's marks, that was far from the case. That man, named spencer, said his interaction with natasha began with her asking him out to drinks. After flaking out the first time, spencer said natasha messaged him a month or so later and invited him to see her friend who was \" djing near union square \" on saturday. Spencer said he arrived to a stage, their intended meeting point, where dozens of other men were also gathered. To spencer's shock, the woman he was intending to meet soon stepped onto the stage. \" she says ' i've invited you all here for a chance to go on a date with me, ' \" spencer wrote. \" and proceeds to give a hunger games speech about what its gonna take to date her. \" despite his annoyance at having been duped, spencer had to hand it to natasha. \" at that point i am genuinely amazed at the fallopian fortitude this girl possesses, \" he tweeted. \" this is top 10 greatest finesse of all time.

It remains unpopular enough that president obama isn't making any live appearances to celebrate the anniversary, an aide tells the wall street journal. Still, even if justices declare the law unconstitutional, popular elements could remain. For instance, insurers would theoretically be free of the rule allowing kids to stay on their parents ' coverage until age 26. But the measure is popular, and most states have already adopted it into their own rulebooks. Measures such as those banning lifetime limits on coverage and requiring coverage for mammograms and colonoscopies would likely remain for similar reasons, experts say. But other key rules could fade, including drug discounts for seniors in medicare's \" doughnut hole \" coverage gap and medicare coverage for preventive care.

A study in science describes three ornithomimosaur specimens - distantly related to birds - from canada. Both juvenile and adult specimens had evidence of downy feathers, but only an adult had wing-like structures. That suggests that wings may have evolved not for flight, but rather to aid in the quest to reproduce. The ornithomimids - from the latin for \" bird mimics \" - superficially resembled modern-day ostriches, with a toothless beak, large eyes and long legs, but they also had a long, thick tail. The new specimens were found in ancient river deposits in alberta, canada. They join a number of other striking feathered dinosaurs found in ancient lake deposits in china and germany, for which the presence of feathers is inferred by subtle markings on the fossil bones and wispy markings in the surrounding fossilised sediment. However, the new fossils come from a very different part of the dinosaur family tree. \" the specimens from china that show wings are dinosaurs that are more closely related to birds, \" explained darla zelenitsky of the university of calgary in canada, lead author on the research. \" this particular"

Yesterday, flay asked a court to uphold his prenuptial agreement with wife of 10 years stephanie march, the new york post reports. But that prenup requires him to pay march just $ 5,000 a month, and when he sent a check for that amount to march over the weekend, her lawyer reportedly sent it right back and claimed the prenup is \" unenforceable. \" ( flay is reportedly worth more than $ 20 million. ) sources say flay also canceled march's credit card over the weekend, since he doesn't want to pay her more than the aforementioned $ 5,000 per month. Yesterday, sources told page six the credit card cancellation was also part of the couple's agreement for how things would proceed should their marriage end. And sources close to flay tell tmz that the celebrity chef has pointed out that if march didn't like the terms of the prenup, she didn't have to sign it 10 years ago. Tmz has more details of the prenup: apparently the $ 5,000 a month only lasts for five years, and flay only has to pay march $ 1 million to buy her out of their $ 8 million home, plus $ 50,000 to pack and move. But march's lawyers are reportedly threatening to air the couple's dirty laundry in order to goad him into a settlement that gives their client more.

Much of the case against jerry sandusky hinges on former assistant coach mike mcqueary's report that he saw sandusky raping a boy in the showers in 2002. But in grand jury testimony, mcqueary family friend dr. Jonathan dranov says that just after the alleged incident, mcqueary explained the situation in less certain terms, an insider says. Dranov was at mcqueary's father's home when the then-28-year-old showed up looking for advice: according to the source, mcqueary said that he had heard \" sex sounds \" and saw a boy look out of the shower before being pulled back by an adult arm; within seconds, a towel-clad sandusky exited the shower. The source says dranov testified that mcqueary three times told him he had not seen any sexual contact; dranov thus advised mcqueary to tell joe paterno about the incident rather than police. That account doesn't match mcqueary's own grand jury testimony, which is the basis for the perjury case against two penn state officials. It also casts new light on joe paterno's assertion that he was never told explicit details of a rape, notes espn.

There, dr. Jonathan dranov, a family friend and colleague of mcqueary's father, sat with the then 28-year-old graduate assistant and listened to his very first account of what he had seen, a source told the patriot-news. According to the source with knowledge of dranov's testimony before the grand jury, it went like this: mcqueary heard \" sex sounds \" and the shower running, and a young boy stuck his head around the corner of the shower stall, peering at mcqueary as an adult arm reached around his waist and pulled him back out of view. Seconds later, sandusky left the shower in a towel. That account is different from the hand-written statement obtained by the patriot-news that mcqueary provided for investigators when he was interviewed in 2010. It's also different than the summary of his grand jury testimony in the 23-page initial grand jury presentment. In both of those accounts, mcqueary says he witnessed sandusky sodomizing a boy as he stood with his hands against a shower wall. Mcqueary says the pair turned and looked at him before he left.

Mcqueary testified that after witnessing the alleged assault, he left the building, called his father and the next day told paterno what he saw. Penn state assistant mike mcqueary told a grand jury and police that he saw former nittany lions assistant jerry sandusky sexually assaulting a young boy in the showers of the team's football facility in 2002.but he reportedly told a family friend a different account of the incident shortly after it happened.

            "State college -- minutes after mike mcqueary says he stumbled upon something between jerry sandusky and a boy in a penn state shower in 2002, he went to his father's state college home seeking advice. There, dr. Jonathan dranov, a family friend and colleague of mcqueary's father, sat with the then 28-year-old graduate assistant and listened to his very first account of what he had seen, a source told the patriot-news. According to the source with knowledge of dranov's testimony before the grand jury, it went like this: mcqueary heard \" sex sounds \" and the shower running, and a young boy stuck his head around the corner of the shower stall, peering at mcqueary as an adult arm reached around his waist and pulled him back out of view. Seconds later, sandusky left the shower in a towel. That account is different from the hand-written statement obtained by the patriot-news that mcqueary provided for investigators when he was interviewed in 2010. It's also different than the summary of his grand jury testimony in the 23-page initial grand jury presentment. In both of those accounts, mcqueary says he witnessed sandusky sodomizing a boy as he stood with his hands against a shower wall. Mcqueary says the pair turned and looked at him before he left. However, dranov told grand jurors that he asked",
            "Curley and schultz have testified they were told about \" horseplay \" that mcqueary said made him feel uncomfortable. Mcqueary says he told them graphic details about a sexual assault. As previously reported, mcqueary told a friend in an email that he stopped the alleged rape and discussed it with police, something a source familiar with the state's investigation confirmed to espn's tom rinaldi. Mcqueary testified that after witnessing the alleged assault, he left the building, called his father and the next day told paterno what he saw. Penn state assistant mike mcqueary told a grand jury and police that he saw former nittany lions assistant jerry sandusky sexually assaulting a young boy in the showers of the team's football facility in 2002.but he reportedly told a family friend a different account of the incident shortly after it happened.

He says the goal of protesters — who traveled to oregon to support father-and-son ranchers dwight and steven hammond, facing prison time for burning federal land — is to return federal land to the people and there has already been talk of renaming the malheur wildlife refuge the \" harney county liberty center. \" local authorities have asked people to steer clear of the area for now. In other developments: the militiamen say they are trying to \" restore \" people's rights, though harney county sheriff david ward describes them as treasonous. They came to the county \" claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the united states, \" he said in a statement. It's not clear how many protesters are actually at the site in eastern oregon, and the number could be anywhere from 15 to 150, reports the oregonian, which describes the occupier as \" militants. \" there were no workers on site when the protesters arrived, and law enforcement officials haven't restricted access to the site or blocked roads in the area. Protest leader ammon bundy, son of nevada rancher cliven bundy, said on sunday that the occupiers have a plan in place that will take several months to accomplish — and that the refuge has been a \" tool of tyranny \" since it was established in 1908, reports oregon public broadcasting. Bundy said the occupiers are there to \" defend the people \" and they don't plan to use force, but they will if they have to. Bundy has called for militia members from across the country to join the protest in oregon, his brother ryan tells the ap that they want the land to be free from federal oversight, so people can use it for logging, ranching, and mining as they see fit. Susan hammond, meanwhile, whose husband and son are due to report to prison monday morning, tells opb that she's unsure of the protesters ' motives. \" i don't even know what ' occupying the refuge ' means. I can't judge what's going on out there because i don't know what it is, \" she said. \" i hope they've got some warm clothes.",

Reuters/fort worth star-telegram/max faulkner/pool fort worth, texas ( reuters ) - a texas judge on wednesday upheld his april order of a nearly two-year jail term for the texas \"affluenza \" teenager, who killed four people while driving drunk, a local prosecutor's office said. Judge wayne salvant reaffirmed the four consecutive jail terms of 180 days for each of the four people killed by ethan couch in 2013 when he was 16, the tarrant county district attorney's office said. Couch, now 19, has been incarcerated in tarrant county since january after being deported from mexico, where he had fled with his mother and was later captured along with his mother by mexican authorities. His case was transferred to the adult system in april. Prosecutors had said the sentence was the maximum couch could receive under terms set when his case was transferred to an adult court from the juvenile system. Lawyers for couch had argued it was excessive. Attorneys for couch and prosecutors could not comment on the judge's move due to a gag order he imposed in the case",

Reuters/fort worth star-telegram/max faulkner/pool fort worth, texas ( reuters ) - a texas judge on wednesday upheld his april order of a nearly two-year jail term for the texas \"affluenza \" teenager, who killed four people while driving drunk, a local prosecutor's office said. Judge wayne salvant reaffirmed the four consecutive jail terms of 180 days for each of the four people killed by ethan couch in 2013 when he was 16, the tarrant county district attorney's office said. Couch, now 19, has been incarcerated in tarrant county since january after being deported from mexico, where he had fled with his mother and was later captured along with his mother by mexican authorities. His case was transferred to the adult system in april. Prosecutors had said the sentence was the maximum couch could receive under terms set when his case was transferred to an adult court from the juvenile system. Lawyers for couch had argued it was excessive. Attorneys for couch and prosecutors could not comment on the judge's move due to a gag order he imposed in the case",

            "Our voices were heard! less than 10 hours after madd's letter to judge wayne salvant, the judge did the right thing and signed an order into place today reaffirming that ethan couch will serve 720 days in jail. After years of heartbreak, this is a small victory. But we can never say that we won. No one ever wins in drunk driving crashes. No one can win when someone kills or injures innocent people. You can read my original letter below. - colleen sheehey-church, madd national president dear judge salvant: my name is colleen sheehey-church, and i am the national president of mothers against drunk driving ( madd ). Madd received more than 50,000 petition signatures urging ethan couch's case be moved to adult court. And, madd has been the voice, speaking for the victims that have refused to be silent on this case. Today, i ' m writing to ask you to uphold your april 13th ruling, ordering ethan couch to 720 days of jail time, 180 days for each person he killed. I am doing this on behalf of the victims in this case and on behalf of the tens of thousands of people across the country that want their voices heard. However,"

It was sold in a post office run by mary murphy, who says lottery ticket sales began on the island last year and nobody has won more than $ 25 before.

Daimi akyuz, 46, had been sentenced to a maximum of 36 years in prison after he opened fire at a cafe in the turkish town of foca in 2003, killing one man and injuring two others reportedly seated at his table, reports the daily record. Scottish toddler alistair grimason was also killed when a stray bullet pierced his lung as he slept in a stroller next to his turkish mother, reports the bbc. Despite serving less than a third of his sentence, akyuz was freed late last month; a source says prison overcrowding as a result of last year's failed coup spurred akyuz's early release. His freedom, however, was swiftly cut short. According to reports, akyuz was gunned down outside his wedding in izmir as he smoked a cigarette. Few other details are known, but authorities say they're in the process of interviewing five suspects. \" it is ironic — he was not scared to use guns and that is how he was killed himself, \" says alistair's father, david grimason, who has campaigned for tighter gun controls since his son's death, per yahoo news. But grimason recalled that alistair's killer had two children himself, \" and they have lost their father. I don't take any joy in what has happened. I would rather that he was in prison and being punished for what he did, \" he continues. Grimason says his understanding was that akyuz was to serve the entirety of his sentence. Instead, \" they've let him out to be killed. \" ( in the us, a bride lost her life just minutes after her wedding. )",

        "summary": "A us-based drone startup has found a humanitarian market for its services: hospitals in remote areas of rwanda. The startup, zipline, has begun making deliveries of blood and other medical supplies via the air, a much faster method than navigating the hilly country's network of slow and windy roads, reports the bbc. Doctors phone in their requests to a distribution center, and a drone then takes off and drops its cargo attached to a small parachute. Eventually, the company hopes to provide similar services in rural areas of the us. \" people have this sense that the us leads the world in terms of technology and then africa catches up, and i actually think that might be changing, \" keller rinaudo, zipline's ceo, tells the washington post. \"it's actually smaller countries like rwanda that are willing to take risks and actually invest in something radically new. \" drones have great potential in other african countries, but many are skeptical that in conflict zones, people won't be able to separate lifesaving drones from military ones. For now, rwanda says it has no plans to use the technology for military purposes.",

But the research is early, years away from being used in medical practice, and there are caveats.

Per-erik muskos, a council member in the small town of övertorneå, argues that couples aren't spending enough time together and that a one-hour \" sex break \" per week for the municipality's 550 employees would improve relationships.

Muskos says that replacing a one-hour weekly break already designated for physical fitness with one specifically for sex would also provide \" positive effects on well-being, \" stimulate the local birth rate, and boost morale, reports the new york times. A sociology professor adds that it may also boost productivity. While muskos, 42, is only one council member in a town of 4,500, his idea doesn't seem too far-fetched, observes quartz, considering that swedes have already experimented with six-hour workdays, and enjoy multiple \" fika \" or coffee breaks per day in addition to 480 days of parental leave. But while some on twitter say it's \" time to move to sweden, \" some are concerned about how the rule would be enforced and what it would mean for single employees.

            "Mr. Muskos told colleagues the proposal was no joke, though he acknowledged practical problems like enforcement. It would be difficult to tell, for example, if an employee eschewed sex in favor of a walk in the country. The proposal comes as countries across europe are grappling with how to balance the rigors of modernity and work with the desire for better quality of life. In france, which already has a mandatory 35-hour workweek, subsidized health care and long vacations, the socialist government recently passed legislation granting employees the \"right to disconnect. \" the measure calls for companies with more than 50 employees to help ensure that work does not intrude into days off. Sweden has been at the forefront of european countries seeking to engender employee satisfaction. An experiment with a six-hour workday in the southern city of gothenburg was recently scrapped after it was deemed too expensive. But proponents of the experiment, which was carried out over two years in a city-run retirement home, said it made employees happier, healthier and more productive. The six-hour workday has also proved successful in the private sector, including at a toyota vehicle service center, where it helped improve business.

        "summary": "The ship was fashioned after the titanic, and met an end no less tragic, but the tale of the cap arcona — and the thousands of concentration-camp prisoners who lost their lives aboard it — is one you've likely never heard. The \" nazi titanic \" gets its due in a new book of the same name by robert p. Watson, a historian and professor at florida's lynn university. The german luxury liner was built in 1927 and traversed the atlantic 91 times, reports the columbus dispatch in a review of the book. During wwii, it played the role of the titanic in a nazi propaganda film made to depict the english in a bad light ( that ended up being a bust ), but it otherwise sat at port in the baltic sea until the war's final month, when adolf hitler had the ship packed mostly with concentration-camp prisoners. Records unearthed by watson indicated hitler intended to have a u-boat destroy the ship. Citing \" crossed signals \" and fears the nazi leaders would employ the boats in the harbor to flee to norway, the deseret news reports the british royal air force bombed the cap arcona four days before all german forces surrendered, killing nearly all aboard ( the jerusalem post reports it was carrying at least 4,500 prisoners, of which roughly 350 survived, to the titanic's 1,517 dead ). Though victims'remains washed ashore for more than 25 years, the incident was essentially kept \" secret for seven decades, \" per watson, who first learned of the ship when he came across a letter from a wwii solider that made mention of it. Incredibly, the sun sentinel reports he reached out to scholars at the us holocaust memorial museum, and even they were unaware of the ship. Watson pieced together the story after being granted access to british archives, which the palm beach post reports were to remain sealed for 100 years. ( thousands of items that vanished from auschwitz have been found. )",

With lake shasta, california's largest reservoir, at 93 % capacity, officials opened shasta dam's topmost gates one at a time on wednesday, letting billions of gallons stream down its 602-foot facade over 15 minutes, per the los angeles times. It was a test designed to see how the gates would perform should upcoming storms require their use; officials say they were in good working order despite last being opened in 1998, reports the redding record searchlight. Though the dam's three gates and 12 valves allowed 523,600 gallons of water to spill out of the reservoir per second, a rep for the bureau of reclamation says almost as much water is coming into the reservoir. That's one reason some experts are saying california's five-year drought is over. Not only is the reservoir at 135 % of its historical average for february, per the times, but several areas of california were under flood warnings with record amounts of rainfall this week, reports abc news. \" i believe that the drought is over at this point, \" says a us geological survey hydrologist.

The humane league negotiated the move with the uep, the us's biggest representative of egg producers, and it will be carried out by 2020. Most people probably aren't aware of the practice of culling: nearly all male chicks born at egg-laying hen hatcheries are killed — typically by grinding or gassing — soon after birth because they can't be raised for meat. Chickens to be used that way are bred differently in order to grow quickly and achieve maximum size and amount of meat. Now, uep will start using \" in-ovo egg sexing \" to figure out which eggs are male and terminate them. The fertilized eggs can still be used, though likely not for human food — other uses include pet food or vaccines. The move will save hundreds of millions of male chicks from culling per year in the us, and, as the humane league points out, it \" will also spare tens of thousands of hens from suffering a lifetime on factory farms \" because the male eggs will reduce demand on egg-laying hens. Germany has also pledged to end chick culling by 2017, but the us is among the first nations to make such a pledge, the washington post reports. The humane league previously convinced more than 150 companies to eliminate cages for chickens from their supply chains. ( mcdonald's is cleaning up the mcnugget. )",

This may sound like a technical development, but its magnitude in humanitarian terms is difficult to overstate. That's because standard practice at hatcheries that supply egg farms with hens is to kill almost all male chicks shortly after birth, usually by grinding them to death, as you can see in this horrifying video: gassing is also sometimes used.

            "In a massive victory for animal rights activists, and for america's chickens, united egg producers, a group that represents 95 percent of all eggs produced in the united states, has announced that it will eliminate culling of male chicks at hatcheries where egg-laying hens are born by 2020. This may sound like a technical development, but its magnitude in humanitarian terms is difficult to overstate. That's because standard practice at hatcheries that supply egg farms with hens is to kill almost all male chicks shortly after birth, usually by grinding them to death, as you can see in this horrifying video: gassing is also sometimes used. Hundreds of millions of male chicks are killed this way, every year, in the united states alone. The business logic behind chick culling is hard to get around. There's no reason to keep the male chicks alive; they '",
            "A day-old baby chick. ( juana arias for the washington post ) it's a disturbing practice most americans probably know nothing about: on the day they're born, all the fluffy male chicks born to egg-laying hens at hatcheries are gruesomely killed — usually by being run, while conscious, through what is essentially a blender. That's because they're useless to the industry. They can't grow up to lay eggs, and they weren't bred to be the fast-growing chickens sold as meat. But that's going to change. In what counts as huge news in the animal welfare world, united egg producers — the industry group that represents hatcheries that produce 95 percent of all eggs produced in the united states — announced thursday that it would end this \"culling \" of millions of chicks by 2020, or as soon as it '"

        "summary": "It doesn't take much observational power to note that spiders have tiny brains. Really tiny. So the recent finding out of the university of cincinnati — that they learn how to court mates by eavesdropping on the competition — is all the more impressive. \" it's a complex set of behaviors for a tiny little brain, \" says biologist george uetz of the brush-legged wolf spider his team studied in a lab, noting that the discovery \" has completely changed our way of thinking about this little spider. \" discovery news explains that mating is \" all about the leg tapping \" for these spiders, who try to wow females with a distinct series of taps. The spiders are found in the eastern us and canada, but researchers used lab-raised ones who hadn't witnessed mating rituals in their experiments. Reporting in the journal animal behaviour, researchers say that when the spiders were shown videos of wild males tapping their legs to court females, the lab-raised ones could mimic and even master this behavior — and in just a matter of four days. \" we thought because they were invertebrates with a tiny brain, everything about them is genetically regulated in a hardwired nervous system, ie, they respond instinctively because it's programmed into their nervous system, \" says uetz. Instead, \" not only do they learn from visual cues but also from vibration cues. \" quickly picking up on what's going on is a good thing, as mating is a risky business for these guys. If the tapping doesn't impress the female, she ' ll try to eat the male. Even among males that successfully court their females and mate, up to 12 % are still eaten anyway.

            "( reuters ) - marriott international inc ( mar.o ) said on friday that hackers accessed up to 500 million customer records in its starwood hotels reservation system in an attack that began four years ago, exposing data including passport numbers and payment cards. Shares were down 5.7 percent in late afternoon trade on news of the hack, one of the largest in history, which prompted regulators in britain and at least five u.s. States to launch investigations. The federal bureau of investigation said it was looking into the attack on starwood, whose brands include sheraton, st. Regis, w and westin hotels. It advised affected customers to check for identity fraud and report it to the bureau's internet crime complaint center. The hack began in 2014, a year before marriott offered to buy starwood to create the world's largest hotel operator. The $ 13.6 billion deal closed in september 2016.",

The company said it thought about 500 million people's information was accessed, including an unspecified number who had their credit-card details taken. Marriott said that the unauthorized access had been going on since 2014 and that the breach affected customers who made bookings on or before september 10. Marriott said that customers ' credit-card information was encrypted but that it was possible the hackers also took the information necessary to decrypt them.

But now it turns out that soldiers who fought there 3,000 years ago did the same, say uk researchers. They've found texts dating back to 1300bc in which warriors in ancient mesopotamia describe symptoms that sound very much like ptsd, reports the telegraph. The earliest previous account of ptsd-like symptoms came from the greek historian herodotus in 490bc, which would make this the first description of the problem, says one of the lead researchers from anglia ruskin university. \" they described hearing and seeing ghosts talking to them, who would be the ghosts of people they'd killed in battle — and that's exactly the experience of modern-day soldiers who've been involved in close hand-to-hand combat, \" professor jamie hacker hughes tells the bbc. In that era, men were expected to fight every third year, and they were more likely to die of injuries sustained in battle given the lack of medical know-how, he adds. \" the risk of death and the witnessing of the death of fellow soldiers appears to have been a major source of psychological trauma. \" ( one report suggests that only about half of us vets suffering from ptsd are getting the proper treatment. )",

The last break took place so pistorius ' mental state could be evaluated; the long delay this time around could be thanks to the fact that the transcript, which both sides will review before the trial resumes, is believed to run some 4,000 pages long, cnn reports. As the defense rested, pistorius ' lawyer told the court that some witnesses had refused to testify because they didn't want \" their voices all over the world, \" the bbc reports, though he didn't name those witnesses. After closing arguments, the judge in the case, assisted by two assessors, will rule whether pistorius, 27, killed girlfriend reeva steenkamp intentionally or whether it was an accident, as the athlete claims. If pistorius is found guilty of murder, he faces a prison sentence anywhere from 15 years to life. He could also be found guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide, if the judge decides the shooting was an accident but does not want to acquit pistorius. That verdict would leave his sentence at her discretion, but the bbc notes it could be about 15 years.",

        "summary": "If you're aiming to live in the present, you ' ll want to restrict yourself to the last 15 seconds — because that's how long we perceive the current moment, a study suggests. A group of us researchers say it's not just a split second: instead, our minds seem to blur together what's happening right now with what's happened over that brief period, quartz reports. In other words, \" what you are seeing at the present moment is not a fresh snapshot of the world but rather an average of what you've seen in the past 10 to 15 seconds, \" study author jason fischer explains, per the sydney morning herald. The researchers came to this conclusion using gabor patches — small arrangements of lines. Twelve participants were shown the patches as they flashed onto a screen; one appeared every five seconds. Subjects then said which direction the lines tilted, but got them slightly wrong, influenced by lines they had seen over the past 15 seconds. \" it's a trade-off the visual system makes, \" fischer tells california magazine of these short, slightly blurred snapshots of reality. Imagine, he says, trying to read a street sign while driving in the rain: \" if you were sensitive to every little fluctuation in vision you'd have a very difficult time reading the sign. \"",

Researchers have discovered one reason: our brains perform automatic visual smoothing over time.

It also means that what you see around you - that cup of coffee, the face of your co-worker, your computer screen - may be a time-averaged composite of now and the past. \" what you are seeing at the present moment is not a fresh snapshot of the world but rather an average of what you've seen in the past 10 to 15 seconds, \" said study author jason fischer, a neuroscientist at the massachusetts institute of technology. He showed subjects an image of a black-and-white grating tilted at a random angle for half a second, then asked them to identify the orientation of the grating they just saw. Then a few seconds later, another grating popped up, and they were to identify its angle. If the subjects saw the gratings completely accurately, their answers would have no dependence on past gratings, since the orientations were random.

Jason fischer of the university of california at berkeley, the lead author of the study ( paywall ), said he wanted to know how our perception changes as we shift our attention from one thing to another.

        "summary": "The \" mad genius \" is back in fashion with a new claim that there's a genetic link between creativity and genius, the guardian reports. A study published in nature neuroscience analyzed 86,000 icelanders to flesh out genetic variations that double one's risk of schizophrenia and more than triple the risk of bipolar disorder; there was a 17 % increase in these variants among subjects who were members of national arts societies over nonmembers. Those in the creative arts ( e.g., writers, painters ) were on average 25 % more likely to carry the gene variations than farmers, salespeople, and laborers. Researchers then replicated the study to much the same effect in the netherlands and sweden. \" to be creative, you have to think differently, \" study co-author kari stefansson tells the guardian. \" and when we are different, we have a tendency to be labeled strange, crazy, and even insane. \" but the naysayers are out in full force. First, the effect is small — the genetic factors upping the risk of mental problems explained only about 0.25 % of them, per npr. A university of pennsylvania psychologist makes the nature-versus-nurture argument, noting \" any particular set of genes is only going to explain a very small part of variation in any psychological trait. \" another psychologist points out that a staid lawyer could still be a wonderful musician on the side, and that the study's premise is \" scientifically hollow, but convenient for their purposes, \" per the verge. And a harvard psychiatry professor who interviewed 45 nobel prize-winning scientists for a book ( finding none had signs of mental illness ) agrees that results may be \" skewed. \" \" nearly all mental hospitals use art therapy, and so when patients come out, many are attracted to artistic positions and artistic pursuits, \" he tells the guardian.

Indeed, the first half of the show frequently returned to the many sexual misconduct scandals roiling powerful men and the institutions that once protected them — including senator al franken, the \"s.n.l. \" alumnus who said on thursday that he would resign his seat as he faced allegations from at least six women of groping and improper advances. The show's pointed and effective opening sketch, which featured kenan thompson as the would-be santa and kate mckinnon as his elfin assistant, began with a boy asking mr. Thompson for traditional gifts like mega bloks and lazer tag. \"and, \" the boy added, \"can you tell me, what did al franken do? \" mr.

            "There is no safe space in america where the country's culture wars aren't being waged — not even the make-believe workshop of a shopping mall santa claus — and no ears so innocent that they haven't heard about the sexual misdeeds of some prominent men and accusations against others. That, at least, was the twisted christmas spirit of the \"saturday night live \" cold open this weekend, in an episode hosted by james franco and featuring the musical guest sza. Indeed, the first half of the show frequently returned to the many sexual misconduct scandals roiling powerful men and the institutions that once protected them — including senator al franken, the \"s.n.l. \" alumnus who said on thursday that he would resign his seat as he faced allegations from at least six women of groping and improper advances. The show's pointed and effective opening sketch, which featured kenan thompson as the would-be santa and kate mckinnon as his elfin assistant, began with a boy asking mr. Thompson for traditional gifts like mega bloks and lazer tag. \"and, \" the boy added, \"can you tell me, what did al franken do? \" mr. Thompson was understandably taken aback. \"o.k., wow, let's see, \" he said. \"i think i can handle the mega bloks and the lazer tag. Can you take",
            "Update, with video no political impressions or surprise guests to kick off tonight's saturday night live cold open – instead, the nbc comedy went with a christmas bit that had a bunch of wised-up kids asking kenan thompson's shopping mall santa questions like, \"can you tell me, what did al franken do? \" asked the little boy in a reindeer sweater, \"and what kinda list is roy moore on? \" \"it's more of a registry, \" replied kate mckinnon's helpful elf, asking santa to refrain from calling her sugar plum \"in this climate. \" ( take a look at a couple brief clips below. ) asked another little boy, why do all those football players kneel – do they hate the troops or are they just tired from all the brain injuries? then a little girl complained about feminazis taking away her barbie, and another stumbling over the words \"embassy \" and \"tel aviv. \" ( another little girl missed her set-up entirely, leaving thompson – who may or may not have been to blame – to land a chuck schumer punchline as a non sequitur. Note: as a deadline commenter noticed, the clip above must be of the dress rehearsal. It's mistake-free ). And there was the inevitable inside-nbc joke when santa asked a boy what kind of toy he wanted"

But the building's primary purpose would not be to protect humans from toxic radiation amid nuclear war. Rather, the fortified skyscraper would safeguard powerful computers, cables, and switchboards.

The ap notes that cbs has also promised $ 20 million to 18 women's rights groups. Moonves resigned in september after a bombshell new yorker report uncovered misconduct allegations from six women and a corporate culture that ignored sexual harassment and worse. A later report accused moonves of keeping a female employee \" on call to perform oral sex. \" he has denied most of the accusations. ( cbs paid one star $ 9.5 million in a sexual harassment case, while another star says rejecting moonves cost her a tv show. )",

The people who ousted pro-russian president viktor yanukovych \" intend to make use of the fruits of their victory to attack human rights and fundamental freedoms of minorities, \" lavrov said in geneva, according to the bbc. Russia appears to be tightening its grip on crimea, with thousands of troops now in the region and large ukrainian military bases surrounded. Russian troops have also secured a large ferry terminal, raising fears that yet more soldiers are on the way. In the latest developments: no shots have been fired yet, but ukraine's acting prime minster says armed conflict is a definite possibility and the country's armed forces have been mobilized, reports the washington post. If vladimir putin wants war, \" he has reached that target within a few inches, \" he said. All eyes are on president obama, who has condemned russia's \" breach of international law, \" sent john kerry to kiev, and approved economic sanctions designed to, in one official's words, \" make it hurt, \" the new york times reports. \" it's the most important, most difficult foreign policy test of his presidency, \" says one career diplomat. \" there's no one in europe who can approach him in power. He's going to have to lead. \" the other seven members of the g8 have, at obama's urging, condemned the invasion and suspended plans to attend the group's june summit in sochi, a move shrugged off by a putin spokesman. \" it's not a minus for russia, \" he said. \" it will be a minus for the g8. \" but in a potentially positive development, putin has agreed to germany's proposal for a team of european observers to head to crimea on a fact-finding mission, the la times reports. The kremlin news service said that putin had agreed in a phone call with angela merkel, telling her that russians faced \" the unrelenting threat of violent action from the side of ultranationalist forces. \" meanwhile, russia is taking a beating in the financial markets.

The story generated worldwide headlines and much soul-searching at uva. University president teresa sullivan promised a full investigation and also to examine the way the school investigates sexual assault allegations. Because of the sensitive nature of jackie's story, we decided to honor her request not to contact the man who she claimed orchestrated the",

The cbc reports on the adventures of a survival-minded seal who, desperately trying to escape the clutches of the ravenous orcas pursuing it, hopped aboard the swim platform of a whale-watching boat off the coast of vancouver island. Nick templeman, who runs an adventure touring group and was on the boat, per upi, posted a mildly nsfw video online of the frantic seal, telling cnn that in his 20 years of whale-watching, he has never seen such a sight, with three or four families of orcas going after the hapless seal. But the seal was persistent — and patient. Kirk fraser, the owner of the boat, posted his own ( somewhat more nsfw ) clip on youtube, noting in the caption the seal fell \" three times in panic, \" then hung out on the boat for between 30 and 45 minutes before the killer whales finally gave up and the seal slipped back into the water. Everyone on the boat, meanwhile, was left drenched by the spray that kept spurting from the whales ' blowholes during their scramble for a meal, abc news reports. \" most intense epic experience ever, \" fraser writes on youtube. \" love you nature. \" ( humpback whales, meanwhile, save other marine animals from orcas. )",

But the companies left room for broadband providers to charge extra to route traffic from premium services such as remote medical monitoring and smart-grid controls over dedicated networks that are separate from the public internet. Verizon and google laid out their vision in a policy proposal that they hope can serve as a framework for congress and the federal communications commission in drafting so-called \" network neutrality \" rules. Such rules are meant to ensure that phone and cable providers cannot favor their own services or discriminate against internet phone calls, online video and other web services that compete with their core businesses. Although broadband providers such as verizon and internet-content companies such as google are at opposite ends in the increasingly bitter debate over such rules, the two companies have been in talks for months to try to identify common ground. Their proposal comes just days after the fcc declared an impasse in negotiations to craft an industry-wide compromise on the thorny issue. Fcc chairman julius genachowski is seeking to adopt net-neutrality rules that would ensure that broadband subscribers could readily access all legal online content, applications, services and devices. The proposal from google and verizon would give the fcc authority to enforce those rules for wired networks by prohibiting broadband providers from discriminating against or favoring internet traffic. The proposal would allow the agency to impose a penalty of up to $ 2 million on companies that violate the rules. Wireless carriers, which have more capacity constraints, would not be subject to the restrictions, although they would have to disclose their network management practices.

So said loyola university researchers at the annual meeting of the society for neuroscience this week, where they presented their findings, science daily reports. They've been studying the effects of binge drinking on adolescent lab rats, and report in the journal alcohol that when blood alcohol concentration rises above 0.08 % ( the legal driving limit in many places ) on six occasions, after sobering up and eventually mating, those male and female rats have offspring with certain genes turned off or on that aren't normally. And both parents play a role, not just the mother, reports forbes. Compared to the control population that wasn't exposed to alcohol, the researchers spotted 244 changes in the offspring of mothers and fathers who'd both gone through the binge-drinking routine; 159 when it was just the moms; and 93 when it was just the fathers. Many changes were in the hypothalamus, which governs sleep, stress, eating, and reproduction. In the us, 21 % of teens report having binged on alcohol in the past 30 days alone, with numbers in the uk thought to be even higher, reports the mirror. More than 90 % of alcohol consumed by people under 21 is consumed on a binge. The researchers say this is the first study showing a molecular pathway by which a parent's drinking can impact future generations on a neurological level, and though it's not clear the results apply to humans, researchers think it's likely they do.

But the researchers say that given the overlap in the two species ' brains, and what we know from prior human studies, the results likely apply to humans.

        "summary": "Having a healthy network of friends can do you a lot of good, but can it also save you from a lot of pain? researchers reporting in the journal scientific reports seem to think so. They say that one's ability to tolerate pain can actually predict the size of one's social network, and they came to their conclusion by inflicting, well, pain. Some 101 18- to 34-year-olds participated in the study, first filling out questionnaires that, among other things, asked them about the friends they were in touch with weekly and monthly, reports the guardian. Then came the pain: the participants had to squat with their backs against a wall and their knees at right angles for as long as they could bear it. The researchers ' conclusion: \" pain tolerance is a significant predictor of an individual's social network size. \" and those with the largest number of friends in the \" monthly contact \" bucket showed the strongest pain tolerance, even when accounting for fitness, stress, and personality traits like one's agreeableness. Researchers believe pain-blocking endorphins are behind the connection, and that there could be an evolutionary reason. \" being attached to other individuals is so important to our survival... Collaborating to find food, \" for instance, study author katerina johnson says. So, popular science explains, it follows that \" our bodies would want to reward us for good social interaction ( and make us feel bad when we're not getting enough of it ). \" the researchers note it's possible that those who naturally have a higher pain threshold because of a more active endorphin system get more benefit from friendships and thus seek out more of them.

            "Our results show that pain tolerance positively predicts social network size. This therefore supports our hypothesis that variation in the μ-opioid system underlies individual differences in sociality. These results are consistent with a recent pet imaging experiment demonstrating a correlation between μ-opioid receptor availability and attachment style, such that individuals showing greater avoidance of social attachment exhibit lower receptor densities15. Our findings are also in agreement with previous pain tolerance studies indirectly implicating the endogenous opioid system in human social bonding activities such as music-making18, dancing19 and laughter20. In addition, laughter has since been shown to correlate with elevated μ-opioid activity, as measured by pet scanning ( manninen et al. In prep ). This suggests that tests of pain tolerance like that used in our study may indeed serve as a useful proxy for assessing activation of the μ-opioid system. Variation in μ-opioid receptor signalling may be due to underlying differences in both endogenous opioid release and receptor density, though their relative contribution is yet to be fully determined. However, studies of oxytocin and vasopressin signalling in rodents have shown that cns receptor densities strongly modulate the influence of these neuropeptides, irrespective of neuropeptide abundance21. In fact, analyses of post-mortem brain tissue and in vivo pet studies in humans have revealed a broad range of μ-opioid receptor densities within the population, differing by at least 30 – 50 % 22.

Writing in the journal scientific reports, johnson and robin dunbar, professor of evolutionary psychology at the university of oxford, sought to probe the theory that the brain's endorphin system might have evolved to not only handle our response to physical discomfort, but influence our experience of pleasure from social interactions too. \"social behaviour and being attached to other individuals is really important for our survival - whether that is staying close to our parents, or our offspring or cooperating with others to find food or to help defend ourselves, \" said johnson.

Abc news australia and the bbc report tonya illman was strolling on wedge island at the end of january when she spotted what she thought was garbage and decided to pick it up. Instead, it turned out to be what she called a \" lovely old bottle, \" and she yanked it out of the sand to bring home to display on her bookcase. But when her son's girlfriend saw what she thought was a cigarette inside and dumped it out, it turned out to be a damp piece of paper, rolled up and tied with string, which they took home and put in the oven for a few minutes to dry out. When they finally unrolled it, they were shocked to see the message in german. Dated june 12, 1886, the note appeared to have been tossed off a german boat called the paula. Illman and her husband, kym, brought the bottle to the western australian museum. Maritime expert ross anderson confirmed the old-time gin bottle had been part of a german naval observatory experiment between 1864 and 1933, in which messages in bottles were thrown overboard to study ocean currents. And in the paula's shipping logs, \" incredibly, there was an entry for june 12, 1886, made by the captain, recording a drift bottle having been thrown overboard. \" that would make this the oldest message in a bottle at 132 years old; the previous oldest one, per guinness, was 108 years old. Amazingly, the note was preserved despite the bottle having no cork and being partly filled with damp sand. Anderson explains the bottle's thick glass and narrow opening left the paper relatively unscathed. ( this woman got a reply to her message in a bottle nearly a quarter-century later. )",

        "summary": "For two harvard university undergrads, what began as \" an excuse to eat a lot of cake \" may turn into the invention of a lifetime. John mccallum, a 20-year-old from louisiana, was daydreaming about cake his freshman year during his \"science of cooking \" class when he happened to see someone spraying whipped cream and thought to himself, why not spray cake? is that possible? he and his girlfriend and fellow student brooke nowakowski went on to prove that it is, winning first place and $ 10,000 in the 2014 harvard innovation challenge, reports abc news. Their \" spray cake \" involves spraying cake batter from a can, then cooking it for one minute in a microwave. You can also cook it in a traditional oven, and they say it will cook faster than typical batter because the spraying helps release air bubbles inside, prompting it to rise in the absence of baking soda or baking powder. The ultimate test, though, came when the duo recently took spray cake — which, with just 30 seconds in a microwave, can also make cupcakes — to pastry chef joanne chang, who first inspired mccallum's idea when she lectured in his class about how cakes rise. The result? a big thumbs-up. When mccallum first told her about the idea, \" he was just like, ' cool. Lab project, ' \" nowakowski tells the boston globe. \"but i thought it could go somewhere. \" both are careful to say that spray cake isn't meant to replace cakes baked lovingly from scratch, but is instead an improvement over ready-bake mixes. ( see it in action on youtube. ) the pair, who will be juniors in the fall, are working on patenting it and are trying to find a manufacturer.

Researchers looked at vaccination rates for the 20 years the program has existed, compared them to earlier rates, and estimated that it will prevent 731,700 premature deaths, usa today reports. In the process it will save $ 295 billion in medical costs. As children fail to catch debilitating illnesses, researchers say they ' ll also put money back into society, to the tune of $ 1.3 trillion. But the cdc's glee has to be tempered, medscape points out, by the current measles resurgence. As of april 18, there have been 129 cases this year, compared with 189 for all of 2014, a spike fueled in part by the anti-vaccine movement. A study in the same cdc report found that of california's 58 measles cases, about a third hit patients who declined vaccinations because of \" philosophical objections. \"",
