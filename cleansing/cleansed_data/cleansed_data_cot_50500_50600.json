        "summary": "Just when they thought it was safe to go back in the water, hundreds of swimmers reported feeling ill after braving the waves when pensacola authorities lifted the \" no swimming \" flag. Local officials rejected epa advice to close beaches and are instead relying on lifeguards to spot oil and on bathers to use common sense and not swim where they see oil, the christian science monitor reports. Local authorities complain that tests to check whether water is safe take 3 days to complete, while the location of oil changes hour to hour. \" i went swimming on saturday in the gulf, and it was fine, \" buck lee, the official who reopened the beaches, told the pensacola news journal. \" a day or two later, i might not want to go in there. \" some skeptical pensacola residents say lee reminds them of the mayor in jaws who didn't want to ruin business by shutting down beaches to protect swimmers from sharks on a long holiday weekend.",

The gulf oil spill brought tar balls to the beach, but local officials removed ' no swimming'signs despite recommendations that the beach remain closed. Santa rosa island officials flew the double-red flag – no swimming – over pensacola beach in florida after a swath of thick oil washed ashore from the gulf oil spill june 23. Two days later, against the warnings of federal health officials and based on a visual survey of the beach, the local island authority director, buck lee, reopened the beaches for swimming, urging residents and tourists to come back to the beach.

This week, health officials in escambia county, fla., which includes pensacola beach, reported that about 400 people claimed they felt sick after visiting the beach and swimming in the gulf.

Little is known about the terminally ill dog's life before april, when he was rescued from a high-kill shelter in columbus, where his previous owners left him. \" he wasn't in the best shape, \" says nicole elliott, who found chester on nonprofit animal ark rescue's facebook page. \" they bathed him and shaved away all of the matted, dirty hair. They found a very large tumor on his side, and had it removed. Since then they have shown up all over his body. \" but despite his health problems, elliott is helping him get the most out of his last days. \" i slept on it, and woke up knowing it was the right thing to do, \" she tells wtvm. Chester, likely 13 or 14, now has a facebook page and is checking off a \" bucket list \" to ensure he has an \" awesome final ride, \" elliott tells the new york daily news. So far, chester has had a spa day with a milk and oatmeal bath and a shopping spree for new toys. There have also been plenty of treats, like \" a famous nathans hot dog \" and a sundae. \" i am taking it a day at a time and trying to give him normal doggy experiences that he may have never had the chance to do before, and a ton of spoiling, \" says elliott. Next on the list: dinner at a restaurant, a day at the beach, a boat ride, and a birthday party with other rescued animals. \" there is no estimate on time that i will be blessed with chester, \" elliott says. \" he doesn't seem to be in much pain, but he is slow due to his age. \" she adds \" he still has very perky moments and he loves to terrorize my kitties. \" elliott hopes chester encourages others to adopt from shelters with hospice programs, abc news reports. Other animals \" deserve a chance at a great final journey too! \" she writes. ( this dying dog took a \" bucket list \" trip to the pacific. )",

        "summary": "Since 2012, doctors in massachusetts have observed a most unusual kind of patient just 14 times — or, 14 times that we know about. It all started with max meehan, who was taken to the hospital after his behavior freaked out his family: his memory had suddenly vanished. \" the kid was amnestic, \" neurologist yuval zabar says of the then-23-year-old, and what zabar found when he reviewed an mri scan of meehan's brain essentially freaked him out: as buzzfeed puts it, two bright white orbs where there should have been gray, each \" perfectly localized \" to both hippocampi, which plays a crucial role in the formation of memories. Zabar had never seen it before, but it wasn't a total anomaly: doctors in the state have now identified 13 more people who experienced the same white orbs and memory issues, and one of their commonalities, with two exceptions, is opioid use. In meehan's case, he shot up heroin and collapsed before waking to a seeming inability to form new memories, leaving him in a state that forced him to drop out of college and made it difficult to hold a job. Memory improvements came slowly over two years. \" the only thing that seems to parallel \" the condition — which has been named chias, for complete hippocampal ischemic amnestic syndrome — \" is fentanyl use, \" says another massachusetts neurologist. Among the many varied theories: that there was a toxin in the drugs ingested, or that persistent fentanyl use results in severe respiratory issues that may deprive those parts of the brain of oxygen. For now, state public health officials are pushing the mystery forward by branding chias a \" reportable disease, \" meaning the state will have to be alerted to any new cases. Read the full piece.",

For now, he's ordered the military only to \" be prepared \" to use the poison gas, say intelligence officials. Concern about the chemical stockpile has grown this week as developments on the ground worsen for assad. President obama issued a warning on monday, and hillary clinton reiterated it today, reports the new york times. \" our concerns are that an increasingly desperate assad regime might turn to chemical weapons or might lose control of them, \" she said at nato headquarters in brussels.

        "summary": "The bitter battle over immigration that's been brewing in germany since chancellor angela merkel opened the country's borders to syrian refugees is pitting some within the leader's ranks against her. According to the atlantic, merkel's own interior minister, horst seehofer, drew up plans that would turn back migrants who've already applied for asylum elsewhere in the european union. Merkel struck down the plan and is now facing backlash from seehofer, whose center-right christian social union party holds a leadership meeting monday that could authorize seehofer to push through his demand, per the ap. If he actually does so unilaterally in defiance of the chancellor, many observers believe merkel would likely have to fire him — which in turn could effectively end her current governing coalition and the conservative parties'decades-old alliance in national politics. Merkel, meanwhile, is trying to make sure migration is seen as a problem for all of europe, not just germany. The chancellor has pointed to a june 28 to 29 eu summit at which migration will be a key topic as she insists on holding talks with other countries about it. Migration \" is a european challenge that needs a european answer, \" she said in her weekly video message saturday. \" i think this issue is one of the most decisive for the cohesion of europe. \" however it ends, the spat has laid bare the limits of merkel's authority in a fractious government that took office in march after nearly six months of post-election haggling. However, as bloomberg notes, the difficult coming-together may be what helps save merkel in the end as her interior minister's party seeks to fend off harder-line anti-immigration rivals who could use the infighting to their advantage.",

He said as soon as he heard about the march, he asked his team what the earliest time was that he could go. \" that is why i am going there on the way home and to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there, \" he said. \" i don't think he people of france have any doubt about america's understanding about what happened, about our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of france in this moment of trial. \" while in paris, kerry will be meeting with french foreign minister laurent fabius and pay tribute to the victims of last week's attacks, which killed 17 people.

        "summary": "An amateur detective has written a new book that claims to reveal the real jack the ripper based on dna evidence from a blood-soaked shawl found by one of the victims. Russell edwards, author of naming jack the ripper, writes in the daily mail that he bought the shawl at an auction and called upon a \" world-renowned \" dna expert to help him identify the killer. He admits that most ripper experts had dismissed the shawl, and \" there was no evidence for its provenance, \" but it was apparently kept by the descendants of a law enforcement officer who took it home after catherine eddowes ' murder in 1888. What edwards found: a bloodstain that matched eddowes'dna, and a possible semen stain that matched a polish jew named aaron kosminski. Kosminski, who had fled russian pogroms in the 1880s, was already \" one of six key \" ripper suspects, says edwards. But is the dna match really a match? edwards ' expert, dr. Jari louhelainen, writes in the mail that he used his own \" vacuuming \" method to \" suck out \" the cells — but because they're so old he had to use mitochondrial dna rather than modern-day genomic dna. ( another suspect, walter sickert, matched an earlier mitochondrial dna test, but such matches \" could be shared by anything from between 1 % and 10 % of the population, \" says a ripper website. ) what's more, edwards ' kosminski matches — which were 99.2 % and 100 % on two dna strands — weren't published in a peer-reviewed journal and may not have followed scientific safeguards, reports the independent. Edwards, however, says he nailed it: \" only non-believers that want to perpetuate the myth will doubt, \" he tells the mirror. \" this is it now — we have unmasked him. \" ( one detective says there is no jack the ripper. )",

        "summary": "Another college official has resigned in the wake of racial tension, this time in california. Mary spellman, dean of students at claremont mckenna college, stepped down thursday, after sending an email that sparked an uproar last month, the los angeles times reports. But the larger brouhaha started in april, when around 30 students of color wrote to the college's president to complain about feeling uncomfortable on campus. Just 4 % of undergraduates at the school are black, 8 % are mixed race, 10 % are asian-american, 12 % are latino, and 43 % are white. The students listed incidents such as racial slurs, vandalism, and mockery on campus, and accused administrators of trying to silence their complaints. Then, last month, one latina student wrote an op-ed in which she discussed feeling uncomfortable at the school, and spellman responded with a letter promising to assist students \" who don't fit our cmc mold. \" cue outrage. Spellman's email sparked more protests, including a hunger strike by two students, and the university did a review of her office. She apologized but ultimately stepped down anyway. \" i believe [ stepping down ] is the best way to gain closure of a controversy that has divided the student body and disrupted the mission of this fine institution, \" she wrote in her resignation email. The student protest leaders say they're not done; they want more diverse faculty and staff and more funding for multicultural clubs, among other things. In addition to similar protests at mizzou, the times notes that students at new york's ithaca college are also calling for the president to resign because he allegedly has not addressed racial problems on campus; the new york times reports that students at yale and ucla have also been protesting in recent weeks over campus racial tensions.",

San diego mayor bob filner allegedly falls into that category, we learned yesterday, as attorney marco gonzalez finally detailed some of the sexual harassment allegations that he and other ex-filner supporters have been hinting at. Female staffers call him a \" dirty old man, \" and came up with the phrases \" the filner dance \" and, yes, \" the filner headlock \" to describe interactions with him — which allegedly include filner grabbing the breast and butt of one staffer, the la times reports. Filner once told a female staffer that women in the office would do better \" if they worked without their panties on, \" gonzalez said. Nor did filner confine his abuses to staffers, added gonzalez; he allegedly forcibly kissed two constituents. The revelations came after filner issued a statement proclaiming his innocence. \" i believe a full presentation of the facts will vindicate me, \" he said according to cnn. Which is pretty odd given that he'd previously apologized and said he needed help. Later yesterday, he explained his behavior by saying, \" i ' m a hugger of both men and women. \"",

The seoul lawmakers say the national intelligence service informed them that hyon was killed in front of hundreds of people at a military academy in pyongyang at the end of april, the ap reports.

According to the afp, hyon was last seen in public attending a musical performance on april 28, following a trip to moscow to prepare for kim's visit to russia. The visit was called off around the same time hyon was reportedly executed, and a south korean analyst tells afp he suspects botching the moscow mission may have sealed the military chief's fate.

If confirmed, it marks another demonstration of kim's ruthlessness in dealing with even the most senior officials suspected of disloyalty, following the execution of his uncle and one-time political mentor jang song-thaek in 2013. It also points to possible power struggles within the top leadership, following kim jong-un's decision to cancel a scheduled visit to moscow last week in order to deal with \" internal issues \". Late last month, the south's national intelligence agency ( nis ) reported that kim had ordered the execution of 15 senior officials so far this year, including two vice ministers, for questioning his authority.

National intelligence service officials told a closed-door parliamentary committee meeting that people's armed forces minister hyon yong chol was killed by anti-aircraft gunfire with hundreds watching at a shooting range at pyongyang's kang kon military academy in late april, according to lawmaker shin kyoung-min. Shin attended the briefing. The office of anther lawmaker lee cheol woo released similar information about the nis briefing. The nis didn't tell lawmakers how it got the information, only that it was from a variety of channels and that it believed it to be true, shin said.

Cheryl grimmer's family had recently moved to australia when police believe the 3-year-old was abducted from changing rooms at fairy meadow beach in wollongong on jan. 12, 1970. Investigators had little to go on apart from a ransom note that led nowhere and witness reports that a man was seen running toward a parking lot with a blonde girl in a towel. But when witnesses — aged 9 to 12 at the time of the crime — gathered for a re-enactment of the abduction two weeks ago, they described something investigators had apparently missed: a male, possibly 17 or 18, lurking near the changing rooms prior to cheryl's disappearance, reports the times. \" he was just seen loitering … in the morning and the afternoon, \" a detective says. Authorities believe the male — white with brown hair and blue eyes — may have snatched cheryl after her brother, ricky, took her to the ladies ' changing room and then left to go get his mother, per news.com.au. Ricky grimmer and his two brothers are now asking the suspect to come forward so they can fulfill a promise to their mother, who died three years ago, to find out what happened to cheryl. \" just let us know where she is, give us something so we can mourn, \" grimmer says, adding he's \" never forgiven \" himself for the abduction. \" it's cost me and my family everything. \" a $ 100,000 reward is offered for information leading to an arrest, per aap.

For their experiment, revealed at the american society of clinical oncology's annual meeting in chicago, researchers at piacenza hospital in italy studied two groups of women who had been treated for early breast cancer: 199 who ate mediterranean-style ( including an allowance for one alcoholic drink daily ) and another 108 who ate what they usually did, but with healthy-eating input from a dietician. After three years of following these diets, none of the ladies who went mediterranean suffered relapses, while 11 women from the other group did. Science world report notes these results add onto the news from another, much larger recent jama study that found a mediterranean diet rich in extra-virgin olive oil led to a 68 % reduction in the risk of developing breast cancer. There are drawbacks to the new study — notably, the small sample size, the relatively short follow-up time of three years, and other methodology issues, critics say. \" people were asked to participate in one diet or the other, \" the dana-farber cancer institute's director of clinical research tells the guardian. \" there is no information about the activity level or change in weight which, for most of the lifestyle research, one needs to be aware of. \" and the ceo of uk charity breast cancer care says that while any info about how to possibly keep breast cancer from coming back is a \" welcome addition to our toolbox, \" there's no universal panacea. \" lifestyle choices like eating a well-balanced diet, [ partaking in ] regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can all help reduce the risk of cancer coming back, but they can't prevent it completely, \" she notes, per the independent.

Mattel crows that the rocker babe version of barbie ( who has a little dog named bastardino ), designed by los angeles-based fashion label tokidoki, is a \" funky fashionista, \" notes the telegraph.

Mattel points out that the doll is aimed at the adult collector market, and not sold in toystore chains — but some kids have already posted photos of the doll on their websites. One other controversial version of the buxum doll, totally stylin ' barbie, also has tattoos, but they're removable stickers. Will the new barbie end up sending kids to tattoo parlors? the director of an online toy review magazine says dolls \" don't model behavior. \" he slams critics as \" people with personal issues projecting them on a piece of plastic.

The anne frank house on tuesday revealed that it had managed to read the pages, which a then 13-year-old anne wrote on sept. 28, 1942, and subsequently covered over with brown masking paper, keeping the pages ' contents a tantalizing mystery for decades. It turns out the pages contained four jokes about sex that anne herself described as \" dirty. \" \" i ' ll use this spoiled page to write down'dirty ' jokes, \" anne wrote, then went on to list them; the anne frank house didn't specify what the jokes were, and because of copyright issues, it is unclear whether the passages will be incorporated into new editions. But the institution did share some of what it says were 33 lines about sex education and prostitution also on the pages. On prostitution, she wrote: \" all men, if they are normal, go with women, women like that accost them on the street and then they go together. In paris they have big houses for that. Papa has been there. \" to reveal the words, researchers photographed the pages, backlit by a flash, and then used image-processing software to decipher the words, which were hard to read because they were jumbled up with the writing on the reverse sides of the pages. \" anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile, \" said frank van vree, director of the netherlands institute for war, holocaust, and genocide studies, per the ap. \" the'dirty ' jokes are classics among growing children.

Per the pensacola news journal, dericka lindsay was pronounced dead saturday after an incident at the home of her parents, grace smith, 69, and james smith, 62. Grace smith's arrest report notes that she says she was having trouble disciplining dericka, so she phoned her niece, 64-year-old veronica green posey, to help her out. When posey arrived, grace smith says her niece hit dericka with a metal pipe and a ruler, and when dericka ran into an armchair, posey followed the child and sat on top of her. James smith told cops posey sat on dericka for 10 minutes, at which point dericka said she couldn't breathe. Posey reportedly remained sitting for two more minutes after that, and when she stood up, she saw dericka wasn't moving. A 911 call brought paramedics to the home, and dericka was transported to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

Although he didn't spell out how the us calculated those estimates, gersten said fewer than 20 airstrikes specifically targeting the cash stashes — including money used to pay for sex slaves — were carried out. \" we're seeing a fracture in their morale, we're seeing their inability to pay … we're watching them try to leave, \" gersten said.

The revelation comes by way of kevin burke, who filed a foia request in december 2014 regarding the \" tsa randomizer \" ipad application, which was basically used like so: a tsa agent holding an ipad would tap the app. If a left arrow appeared, the traveler went in the left security-check lane; a right arrow, right. A 2014 bloomberg article explained some of the reasoning behind the software, which mainly related to the use of the speedier precheck lane and the selection of the fliers who would randomly be directed there from the regular lane. The randomness would make it tougher for would-be terrorists to identify security-screening patterns they would use for their benefit, bloomberg explains, and help dispel the appearance of profiling. Cost-wise, burke's headline is a little more jaw-dropping: \" the tsa randomizer ipad app cost $ 1.4 million. \" but a tsa rep tells mashable $ 336,413.59 was paid to ibm for \" mobile application development, \" with the aforementioned $ 47,400 earmarked for the randomizer software; mashable reports the $ 1.4 million is the total of the overall contract with ibm. As for the app, it's no longer in use. Though it had been employed in more than 100 us airports, the \" managed inclusion \" program was axed last year after a convicted felon followed the arrow...

Charges: second-degree depraved heart murder, involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, manslaughter by vehicle, misconduct in office. Lt.

Charges: involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, misconduct in office, false imprisonment. Officer edward nero: he, too, was on the bike patrol. The 29-year-old handcuffed gray after apprehending him and helped hold him down until the van arrived. Mosby says there was no probable cause for the arrest.

They zeroed in on the component in stevia that triggers two bitter receptors on the human tongue and were able to modify it through non-chemical means, the scientists say in a university press release. Researchers tested the end result in orange juice and say the sweetness held up. \" it's a chemical-free, economical, and purely physical interaction-based approach to control reb a's interaction with taste receptors, which will bolster its taste profile, \" says the lead author of the study in food chemistry, using the shortcut for rebaudioside a. Stevia has gained popularity because it is derived from a plant, is much sweeter than actual sugar, and — the big one — has zero calories, notes a previous explainer at live science. But as business insider has reported, that \" bitter kick \" has held the sweetener back commercially. ( truvia and stevia in the raw are two big brand names featuring stevia. ) the cornell researchers say this finding could make the ingredient more common in beverages and all across the food industry. Still, the cbc notes that there's much debate among nutritionists over the pros and cons of stevia. \" we don't want to habituate our taste buds, get them used to sweet foods all the time, \" says one. \" if you're going to use stevia, use it with caution. \" ( a study suggests that reducing kids'sugar intake improves their health remarkably quickly. )",

Senate majority leader harry reid and minority leader mitch mcconnell reached a \" major setback \" today over a fairly wonky provision known as \" chained cpi, \" democratic sources tell politico. A means of calculating entitlement benefits, cpi is anathema to many liberals because it would give social security beneficiaries lower payments. And democrats say they have made other concessions, like raising taxes only for those earning more than $ 400,000. Mcconnell spoke on the senate floor today, saying republicans hadn't received a response to their offer from last night, the new york times reports. Reid responded that democrats had no counter-offer because they were \" apart on some pretty big issues. \" president obama said today on meet the press that he would accept \" chained cpi \" but only as part of a bigger deal that includes at least $ 1.2 trillion in new revenue over a decade. As it stands, reid and mcconnell are cutting a smaller deal to head off certain tax hikes and medicare cuts, without tackling the deficit or preventing $ 109 billion in defense and domestic spending cuts slated for this year.",

When he left emanuel ame church in charleston, roof got back on the interstate and took an exit that brought him to branch ame church about 30 miles away, per the station, which cited gps data not used in his federal trial. There, he turned off his gps for several minutes, which prosecutors say suggests he sat there contemplating another attack. Like emanuel, the church had a bible study that night, though it's unclear whether anyone was inside at that time or whether roof actually left his car. Roof told investigators upon his arrest that he was too tired to pull off another attack, notes abc news. The second church is located on a stretch of road with few other businesses, making it unlikely roof would have stopped there deliberately. Plus, prosecutors say he drove by it months earlier when he was scouting locations. Roof was sentenced to death in his federal trial for killing nine people at emanuel, but the new information could still be relevant.

            "Columbia, s.c. ( ap ) — convicted charleston church shooter dylann roof has asked for a new federal trial, saying prosecutors didn't have jurisdiction to bring their case against him. Roof's attorneys made that request friday, claiming the government failed to prove his use of the internet, highways and a gun manufactured out of state were sufficient enough links to allow religious obstruction charges. Roof, 22, was sentenced to die earlier this year for killing nine black members of charleston's emanuel ame church in june 2015. In a videotaped confession to fbi agents, roof admitted to his role in the killings and told jurors in his closing argument that he still felt compelled to commit them.

Conan isn't directly competing with rival jay leno, but his 11pm cable slot pits him against two much more challenging opponents: jon stewart and stephen colbert, both riding high from their hugely popular washington rallies, reports the new york times. Others raise more pressing concerns: will the beard stay? \" that orange facial fuzz has come to typify everything we love about the new conan, \" writes eric ditzian on mtv. Ditzian also weighs in on the rumored first guest, andy richter's role, and another big question — will he make any leno jokes?

Experts discovered the planet's very low vibrations in the late 1990s, and now researchers may be able to explain them, live science reports. According to ardhuin's team, the hum is a result of ocean waves. Waves don't just occur at the ocean's surface, live science explains: they can reach to the bottom of the ocean. There, they move along a \" bumpy \" sea floor, creating pressure that leads to the earth oscillating, the american geophysical union reports. That could explain the so-called \" microseismic \" waves behind the hum — at least those lasting from 13 to 300 seconds, according to researchers ' models. Shorter microseismic waves could be the result of waves crashing into each other. The wave theory isn't entirely new, live science notes, but the findings offer a fuller explanation of what could be happening. \" i think ( the results are ) a relief to the seismologists, \" says the oceanographer. \" now we know where this ringing comes from, and the next question is: what can we do with it? \" one possibility: the research could help experts spot earthquakes occurring a long distance away, agu notes.

        "summary": "When an isolated tribe emerged from the amazon in recent weeks and initiated contact with brazilian scientists in the village of ashaninka near the peruvian border, some called the move \" potentially tragic \" — and, indeed, though they were quickly quarantined for their own safety, all five men and two women were sick with the flu within days. After extensive back-and-forth with doctors flown into the remote village, the reluctant tribespeople agreed to take medicine, and no one died, forbes reports. Still, according to brazil's indian protection agency, funai, researchers now fear that the tribespeople, who were given flu shots before they returned to the jungle, may have brought the disease to their home and spread it to other vulnerable people, science reports. \" only time will tell if they reacted quickly enough to divert a catastrophic epidemic, \" says one expert. Some experts say that diseases are likely responsible for wiping out many aboriginal populations up and down the americas over the past 500 years. With neither natural immunity nor modern medicine, diseases they've never encountered can prove punishing and deadly. Officials think the tribe initiated contact ( something so rare it hasn't happened in the amazon in decades, popular science reports ) because of continued harassment by illegal loggers and drug traffickers who have moved into their lands — \" the group told us their tribe had been shot at by white men, \" says a funai worker. It's unclear whether they got the flu from that contact, from villagers in places they'd recently raided for food and tools, or from the scientists they met when they emerged from the jungle. Researchers say the tribe may be part of the chitonahua people; they wore only bark belts and carried wooden spears, bows, and arrows. ( one advocacy group says the tribe may have reached out because it feels it has \" nowhere left to go. \" )",

Within days, all had contracted influenza, said carlos travassos of funai, brazil's national indian foundation. \"without medical treatment they certainly could have died, \" he said. The tribespeople carried wooden spears and bows and arrows and wore only bark belts. Doctors were flown in to the remote village and were able to talk to the nomads through an interpreter who knew a similar language, persuading them to take medicine that helped them to recover before they went home to their people. \"at first they were afraid and wary, but thankfully in the end they understood, believed us, trusted the medical team and accepted the medicine, \" said travassos. \"it was a difficult and slow dialogue. \" entire tribes have been exterminated after making contact with the outside world. \"the uncontacted indians now face the same genocidal risk from disease and violence which has characterized the invasion and occupation of the americas over the last five centuries, \" said survival international, a charity that supports indigenous peoples.

Officers told the man to think over his decision, but when he visited a police branch the next day, his choice was the same. In a handwritten letter, he described his intentions for the money — though he also made one small, additional request: he asked for a job. Kelly says he plans \" to do everything i can to help find him a job that fits his personal situation \" and is soliciting help. ( a 5-year-old recently brought a homeless man to tears. )",

        "summary": "The search for what investigators say is the \" best lead \" so far in the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight 370 resumed in earnest at daybreak today as boats and planes searched a patch of the southern indian ocean for possible plane debris. So far, there has been no trace of the floating debris seen on a satellite image. Search teams ended today's mission without finding anything, cnn reports. A total of four military planes and one civilian plane joined the search today in an area australian prime minister tony abbott describes as \" about the most inaccessible spot that you can imagine on the face of the earth, \" reports the bbc. China has announced that it is sending three military vessels to the area, and they may be joined by an icebreaker currently in perth after an antarctic mission. Australia is now planning to use human spotters — \" highly skilled and trained observers \" looking out the windows of low-flying planes — to search for the debris rather than radar, the new york times reports. After two days of fruitless radar searching, an official explains that while humans are slower than radar, they might have a better chance at spotting debris. Weather conditions in the area known as the \" roaring 40s \" ( due to the frequent storm-force winds in latitudes between 40 and 50 degrees, \" explains reuters ) have hampered the search so far, and while conditions are improving, fog and low visibility are still a factor, the guardian finds. Also troublesome: most of the planes assisting in the search have to deal with a seven-hour round trip to the search area, meaning they only have two hours of actual search time before they have to head back to refuel, according to an australian official quoted by nbc news. If debris is found, investigators will use computer models to try to retrace it to a crash scene that could be hundreds of miles away. \" there are sophisticated models that allow you to work backwards from the current position of each piece of debris, after considering the currents and the winds and so on, \" an expert who helped locate the black boxes after the 2009 air france disaster tells reuters. \" that enables you to say x marks the spot on the surface. \" but an australia official cautions that the debris may have sunk since the satellite image was taken five days ago. \" something that was floating on the sea that long ago may no longer be floating, \" he told reporters. \" it may have slipped to the bottom. \"",

The university of haifa researchers, who have been excavating hippos for 15 years, said today that they found a dove-shaped pendant and a woman's skeleton under the remains of a roof. They also dug up ancient artillery balls for a huge catapult and a statue's marble leg. \" finally the findings are coming together to form a clear historical-archaeological picture, \" says chief excavator michael eisenberg. They also found evidence that the first hippos quake, in 363 ad, razed the city, which residents spent 20 years rebuilding. A second temblor in 749 ad destroyed the city for good. But not all the evidence is clear — like the marble leg from a sculpture in the roman baths: \" it could be a god or athlete whose sculpture was over two meters tall, \" says eisenberg. Despite looking like \" an old photograph come to life \" with its volcanic, gray stone and main street still intact, hippos draws few tourists these days, the jewish exponent reports. But israel plans to spend $ 35 million to turn hippos and other second-tier historic sites into area attractions \" for interpretation, mostly from a jewish point of view, \" says a government archaeologist.",

It also asserted that countries'diplomatic missions should be located in places other than jerusalem. The 14 other security council members voted in favor of the resolution, making for a tally that the new york times describes as \" punctuat[ ing ] the american isolation over a central issue in the israeli-palestinian conflict. \" in explaining the united states'veto, haley said the vote was cast with \" no joy, but...

Civic engagement. \" just as tv became the primary medium for civic communication in the 1960s, social media is becoming this in the 21st century, \" zuckerberg writes, setting out plans to boost civic engagement and help hundreds of millions of people around the world register to vote. Community standards. Zuckerberg makes it clear that he was stung by criticism of the site for taking down controversial material. He says since standards vary between users and between societies, people will be allowed to have their own settings, and \" content will only be taken down if it is more objectionable than the most permissive options allow. \" \" history has had many moments like today, \" zuckerberg writes in conclusion.",

The heavily redacted 253-page report puts president trump and his cohorts generally in the clear, noting the panel found \" no evidence that the trump campaign colluded, coordinated, or conspired with the russian government. \" what it did find was that the obama administration dropped the ball with a \" slow and inconsistent \" response to the russians, and that both the trump and clinton campaigns showed \" poor judgment and ill-considered actions. \" the report, which was said to be based on interviews with nearly 75 witnesses and a scouring of hundreds of thousands of documents, also concludes that any attempts of trump associates to try to forge a relationship with russia were either unsanctioned by trump or didn't pan out. But the new york times notes that democratic committee members, who didn't endorse the report, have said their gop colleagues didn't probe as deeply as they should have and wrapped up investigative efforts early to help shield the president from any trouble. A nearly 100-page democratic rebuttal to the gop's report says \" a majority \" of its findings are \"misleading and unsupported by the facts and the investigative record, \" per the post. Trump immediately jumped on the announcement, tweeting just minutes after the news broke: \" just out: house intelligence committee report released. ' no evidence'that the trump campaign ' colluded, coordinated or conspired with russia.

            "This week's map shows the real value of $ 100 in each state. Prices for the same goods are often much cheaper in states like missouri or ohio than they are in states like new york or california. As a result, the same amount of cash can buy you comparatively more in a low-price state than in a high-price state. The bureau of economic analysis has been measuring this phenomenon for two years now; it recently published its data for prices in 2013. Using this data, we have adjusted the value of $ 100 to show how much it buys you in each state. For example, ohio is a low-price state. $ 100 there will buy you stuff that would cost $ 111.61 in a state closer to the national average. You could think of this as meaning that ohioans are, for the purposes of day-to-day living, eleven percent richer than their incomes suggest. The states where $ 100 is worth the most are mississippi ( $ 115.21 ) arkansas ( $ 114.29 ) south dakota ( $ 114.16 ) alabama ( $ 114.03 ) and west virginia ( $ 113.12 ).

In other words: by this measure, if you have $ 50,000 in after tax income in mississippi, you would have to have after-tax earnings of $ 68,000 in the district of columbia just to afford the same overall standard of living. It's generally the case that states with higher nominal incomes also have higher price levels. This is because there is a relationship between the two: in places with higher incomes, the prices of finite resources like land get bid up. But the causation also runs in the opposite direction. Places with high costs of living pay higher salaries for the same jobs. This is what labor economists call a compensating differential; the higher pay is offered in order to make up for the low purchasing power. This relationship is important, though it is not the only thing that matters. Some states, like north dakota, have high incomes without high prices.

Bad news: the distribution of that new wealth was as uneven as ever. According to credit suisse's 2017 global wealth report, the richest 1 % now account for a record 50.1 % of all global wealth, approximately $ 140 trillion, up from 42.5 % in 2008. Meanwhile the poorest 70 % of adults have just 2.7 % of global wealth — that's about 3.5 billion adults with less than $ 10,000 in assets each, the guardian reports. \"the outlook for the millionaire segment is more optimistic than for the bottom of the wealth pyramid, \" fortune quotes the report as stating. There were 2.3 million new millionaires created in 2017, bringing the total to 36 million millionaires worldwide. That's nearly triple how many there were in 2000. But the divide isn't just between the haves and have-nots; it's also geographical and age-related. Wealth in africa actually fell by 1.9 % per adult this year. In north america, it grew by 8.8 % per adult. And more than 40 % of the world's millionaires live in the us. Meanwhile credit suisse chairman urs rohner warns of the \" millennial disadvantage. \" he says \" millennials face particularly challenging circumstances, \" with baby boomers hogging housing and top jobs, and have had little chance to accumulate wealth. The younger generation, stuck with students debt and paying for the pensions of baby boomers, are expected to do less well financially than their parents.",

She had to keep her evenings open for him, not drink alcohol, and not speak in public, among others. She says she felt forced to take a job at his firm and adds \" [ i ] let him sexually assault me \" after he reminded her his previous relationship had ended due to a lack of sex. For that reason, she says, she gave into sex whenever he wanted it, though she sometimes just \" laid there for him \" and cried during it. \" he called it'starfishing. ' he thought the whole idea was funny, \" she notes. She adds she had an ectopic pregnancy she had to terminate, and his first question to the doctor post-surgery was: \" when do you think i can have sex with her again? \" after she left him, she says her ex blacklisted her from work and she became suicidal.

Example: \" we are failing to let men know that when they drink to excess, they can end up becoming these very perpetrators. … that's not villainizing men; that's trying to prevent them from becoming rapists. \" \" rape is a societal problem, not a self-help issue, \" writes fellow slate writer amanda hess. \" rape has been a popular tool for subjugating women long before they joined in the ' butt-chugging ' craze. \" yoffe tweeted that she wanted to warn women \" that there are rapists who use alcohol, not violence. \" but that just reinforces \" the idea that rape does not constitute a violent crime if alcohol is involved. \" but megan mcardle at bloomberg comes to yoffe's defense, writing that when people come to visit her, she warns them not to go down streets where people tend to get robbed. \" that doesn't mean that i ' m saying mugging is ok, much less that i ' m somehow in league with mugging culture. \"",

The french cardiac surgeon — under carmat, the french company he founded — has invented what the independent calls the \" world's first fully artificial, self-regulating heart, \" and it apparently works, at least very initially. Carpentier's creation was successfully transplanted into a 75-year-old on wednesday; he's said to be responding favorably. If you're wondering why it deserves the label \" first, \" especially considering robert jarvik's artificial heart was first implanted in 1982, carpentier, 80, explains that his is the first heart to self-regulate, mimicking an actual heart. \" if your loved one came through the door [ and you had a carpentier artificial heart ], it would start to beat faster, just like a real one, \" he says. Further, surfaces that are exposed to human blood are made in part from cow tissue, rather than synthetic material, which can produce blood clots and therefore require the use of anticoagulants; its design also minimizes the chance of rejection, reports the financial times. Most importantly, it's designed to sidestep the need for a donor heart: reuters reports the current model, powered by external lithium batteries, is expected to keep a patient alive for up to five years. The heart was three decades in the making, and the end result is similar in size to a real heart, though it weighs three times more ( at nearly 2 pounds ) and isn't sized correctly for all — about 86 % of men but only 20 % of women, reports reuters ( a smaller model is planned ). The expected cost is $ 190,000 to $ 220,000, on par with the cost of a traditional heart transplant. The carmat heart has been approved for testing in three more french patients; the initial trial seeks to determine whether the patients can survive at least one month.

            "Update: 4/19/2001 read richard metzger: how i, a married, middle-aged man, became an accidental spokesperson for gay rights overnight on boing boing it's time to clarify a few details about the controversial \"hey facebook what's so wrong with a pic of two men kissing? \" story, as it now beginning to be reported in the mainstream media, and not always correctly. First of all, with regards to the picture: the photo which was used to illustrate my first post about the john snow kiss-in is a promotional still from the british soap opera \"eastenders. \" it features one of the main characters from the show ( christian clarke, played by the actor john partridge- left ) and someone else who i don't know. I am not a regular viewer so i can't say if the man on the right is an extra or an actual character. This picture has itself caused scandal in the uk, as it was a gay kiss that was broadcast before the watershed, and as such led to a number of complaints to the bbc. However, since this episode aired ( october 2008 ) christian now has a boyfriend and a few more gay kisses have taken place. In relation to the john snow kiss-in event, i used this particular photo because i considered it to be quite mild ( no groping, no tongues ). The photos i had considered using before i chose that one are much more racy. Oh the irony! secondly, the removal of the facebook john snow kiss-in event: it turns out that",

But john herrman at buzzfeed has another explanation: \" fear of dying alone. \" here's what he and other pundits are saying: the presentation \" manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic, \" herman argues — like capturing a whole 15 % of the smartphone market. \" it's a fitting end for the close of microsoft's ballmer era, during which the company … missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades \" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, microsoft is trying to ape the apple model, mobileopportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \" there already is an apple, \" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like palm and blackberry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its os. The move risks complicating microsoft's crucial relationships with other pc and device manufacturers, one analyst tells zdnet. But he adds that \" microsoft needed to make a bold move \" or face \" certain terminal decline, \" and that the price it paid for nokia \" seems extremely reasonable. \" meanwhile, matthew yglesias at slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from nokia ceo ( and, perhaps, microsoft heir apparent ) stephen elop, in which he uses the story of a deepwater horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform — a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move — to explain the company's shift from its own failed os to windows phone. Of course, yglesias notes, that move \" was basically a total failure. \" to read the full parable, click here.",

The court — which is divided 5-4 for conservatives, but saw justice roberts vote liberal on obamacare and same-sex marriage — will look at cases including unions, affirmative action, and possibly abortion. A primer: unions: since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now california teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. \" it could set the stage for a citizens united-style reconsideration in the area of union dues, \" a lawyer says. Affirmative action: abigail fisher says that being white played a role in the university of texas denying her admission back in 2008. The supreme court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in pennsylvania, kansas, georgia, and florida, the wall street journal reports. Justices ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional. \" one person, one vote \": should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters? if justices choose the latter — leaving out immigrants and children — latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain, politico reports. Abortion: justices may opt to revisit a texas law that could reduce the state's abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10. At issue is whether new clinic requirements are an \" undue burden \" on women's right to an abortion. One commentator believes this supreme court session will be ugly for liberals.",

        "summary": "In 1783, after the british soldiers left new york city, george washington is believed to have stopped for a celebratory drink at the bull's head tavern. Now a preservationist thinks he's found the historic site — and if he's right, it could be the oldest building in manhattan. Adam woodward had heard that the building at 50 bowery, currently scheduled to be demolished so a hotel can go up, might have \" the bull's head's structure, cellar, bones, \" he tells cbs new york. So he searched the basement, and \" found myself in what i am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern, \" he says. Specifically, he found what he thinks are hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls from the colonial era. Since that time, the building has housed a drugstore, a chinese restaurant, and a beer garden, among other things. Now he's hoping city officials will preserve the site, saying, \" what an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge. \" a historian is also convinced it is indeed the old tavern, and investigations have been launched by elected officials and the landmarks preservation commission, eater ny reports. But ultimately, the commission says, it \" cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology, \" so a lot depends on him. He's apparently not talking yet; the new york times couldn't get hold of him.",
