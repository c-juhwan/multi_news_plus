On issue after issue \"there's a staggering void in the debate, \" with issues and ideas neither party will touch. A third party could cover that ground; miller's even written a massive third-party stump speech, advocating tax hikes, cuts to popular programs, and other policies that won't poll well, but that the \"far center \" should rally around. \"politicians will scramble to lead any parade that forms, \" he writes. \"let's get busy organizing the right parade, and together we might just save the country. \"",

Santorum easily captures the top spot among tea party republican voters ( 42 % to 23 % ) and evangelical republican voters ( 41 % to 23 % ). One bright spot for romney: 70 % of his supporters believe the gop would back him if he becomes the nominee; only 54 % of santorum's supporters feel the same. Gallup's poll, also released yesterday, found that 32 % of republican registered voters preferred romney, and 30 % favor santorum. That's a 14-point jump for santorum in recent days, and gallup notes that his rise came at the expense of every candidate: he grabbed five points from romney, six from newt gingrich, and three from ron paul. Side note: paul's support hit a 2012 low: 8 %. The new york times/cbs poll out today shows that 30 % of gop primary voters support santorum, to romney's 27 %. But it's still anyone's game: last month, 74 % of voters who backed a candidate said they might still change their pick; that has dropped, but only to 60 %.",

The trial's first witness, neighbor michelle burger, then testified that she awoke after 3am on feb. 14 of last year to a woman's \" bloodcurdling screams, \" the guardian reports. \" it was a climax. She was very scared, \" said burger, who went on to say that the screams were followed by four shots, with a pause between the first and second. In other developments: south africa is so transfixed by the case that a 24-hour channel has been launched to cover it. The channel, called \" the oscar pistorius trial — a carte blanche channel \" launched last night with footage of the life of reeva steenkamp. The network behind the trial channel is one of three broadcasters that will be allowed to cover the trial live, though the testimony of pistorius and other defense witnesses will not be shown and the judge has the option of halting coverage if it becomes intrusive, the ap reports. Pistorius faces life in prison if found guilty. He insists that he shot steenkamp through a bathroom door after mistaking her for a burglar, and the trial is likely to hinge on ballistic evidence from his pretoria home, the bbc reports. South africa has no trial by jury, so pistorius ' fate will be decided by judge thokozile masipa, the second black woman to become a judge in south africa. Legal experts say both the prosecution and defense are happy with masipa as the judge because of her reputation for being unwaveringly fair, the ap finds in a look at the key players in the case.",

        "summary": "When hitting the road on a summer holiday, you're bound to forget something. Hopefully it's not your toddler. Police are questioning a french family after they apparently forgot their 3-year-old daughter at a rest stop while heading south to the french riviera for a vacation. Travelers found the girl yesterday at a rest stop outside loriol-sur-drome, south of valence, and waited for her family to return before calling police. The child could only tell officers that she had a brother and a sister and was \" going to the seaside \" when she saw \" daddy's car pull away, \" per the guardian. Police issued an alert and the parents only noticed their mistake when they heard it on the radio about 45 minutes after the girl was found. The child had apparently been left at the rest stop — which included a playground, per sky news — around midday. \" none of them had noticed she wasn't there \" in the vehicle, an officer says. The bbc reports the girl's father called police at 3pm. By that point, the family had traveled 93 miles and were more than halfway to their destination. They turned around and were reunited with their daughter about two hours later at a police station. Police were questioning the girl's parents last night to ensure the incident was just a case of forgetfulness. \" we are going to listen to what they have to say and talk to the prosecutor at valence to see if this should be taken further, \" the officer says. They're still likely to lose out on the parents of the year award thanks to this pair.",

They were taken tuesday from strängnäs cathedral, in the town of the same name near stockholm. Police say two crowns made of gold, pearls, and jewels and an orb that were part of the 17th-century funeral regalia of sweden's charles ix and kristina the elder were lifted around noon, with witnesses describing two men fleeing and then taking off in a speedboat on lake malaren. The guardian reports that's the country's third largest lake and sits \" a couple hundred meters \" from the cathedral. \" it's simply not possible to sell these kind of items. So you can only wonder what their intentions are, and how much they know about these crowns, \" a rep with the swedish police national operations department says, per the local. Agnevik echoes that: \" what usually happens with this type of object is that they are recovered sooner or later, because there are very few people who are prepared to handle such items. We have high hopes of getting them back. \" king charles ix died in 1611; his wife died in 1625. The two are buried in the cathedral, per deutsche welle, and quartz adds that they were interred wearing the crowns, which were later exhumed and displayed in the glass cases broken by the thieves.

        "summary": "Many scientists have argued that several different species of human ancestors spread from africa — but a 1.8 million-year-old skull and the fossilized remains of four other creatures seem to tell a different story. The scientists who found the bones at dmanisi, in the country of georgia, in 2005 say they show that a single species fanned out from the continent, the wall street journal reports. \" there are these jaw-dropping moments in the life of a scientist, \" says a neurobiologist who examined \" skull #5, \" as it's called. \" preconceived ideas... Start falling to pieces. \" the crux of the finding: scientists have for years debated whether humans evolved from only one or two species ( think tree branches out from a trunk ) or many off-shoots that dead-ended ( think a bush ). This find bolsters the tree theory. The bones found in georgia show a great deal of variation, but the pre-humans are believed to have died in the same place, within a few centuries of each other. So the researchers believe they are members of the same species, and reason that it's likely the various skulls found in different places and times in africa may not be different species, but variations of one species. Even aside from the tale it tells, the skull is a pretty impressive discovery. \" it's got to be one of the most complete skulls ever discovered in the fossil record of human evolution, \" an anatomy professor tells npr. And as the oldest batch of pre-human fossils found outside africa, the bones set the date of departure from africa \" much earlier \" than previously believed, david lordkipanidze, the lead author of the study published in science, tells the ap. ( previously, that movement was thought to have happened 1 million years ago. ) with the dmanisi finds, \" for the first time, we can see a population.

Why? \" the costs of keeping the beach, the parking lot, and other facilities in operable and safe condition significantly exceeded the fees the business generated, \" he said in legal filings. The lawsuit: a group called the surfrider foundation sued, saying khosla couldn't legally block access to the beach under the the state's landmark coastal act of 1976, which declares that everyone has a right to beach access, reports the los angeles times.",

Beach enlarge this image toggle caption marcin wichary/flickr marcin wichary/flickr the supreme court has refused to take up a billionaire's appeal of a lower court ruling that forced him to maintain public access to surfers and others who visit martins beach, a scenic spot near half moon bay, south of san francisco. The case had been shaping up to be a showdown over california's coastal act, with possible ramifications for other states with laws to preserve public access to beaches. Advocates for public access are hailing the court's decision to decline the case as a victory. The supreme court declined the case on monday, the first day of its new session. A legal fight over the beach had been brewing since 2008, when vinod khosla, a co-founder of sun microsystems, bought martins beach for some $ 37 million. Within a year, his management companies had begun locking a gate at the property; it then shut down a parking lot where members of the public had been able to pay a fee to reach the beach. The abrupt change angered surfers and other locals and drew a lawsuit from the surfrider foundation, which said khosla shouldn't be allowed to privatize a beach that people had used regularly for decades. A california court ruled against khosla in 2014; in august 2017, a california appeals court backed that decision, ordering khosla — a venture capitalist who has invested in solar power, biofuels and clean energy — to reopen the beach. \" today's decision is a significant win for beach access rights across the nation, \" said attorney eric buescher, part of the legal team representing surfrider foundation. In a statement released by the group, he added, \" by declining to hear the case, the u.s. Supreme court has rejected the owner's attempt to purchase a public resource. \" to prepare for a potential supreme court showdown, khosla had hired well-known attorney paul clement, a veteran of dozens of cases at the high court, including the challenge to the obama health care overhaul.

            "Supreme court turns away billionaire who wanted to turn people away from calif. Beach enlarge this image toggle caption marcin wichary/flickr marcin wichary/flickr the supreme court has refused to take up a billionaire's appeal of a lower court ruling that forced him to maintain public access to surfers and others who visit martins beach, a scenic spot near half moon bay, south of san francisco. The case had been shaping up to be a showdown over california's coastal act, with possible ramifications for other states with laws to preserve public access to beaches. Advocates for public access are hailing the court's decision to decline the case as a victory. The supreme court declined the case on monday, the first day of its new session. A legal fight over the beach had been brewing since 2008, when vinod khosla, a co-founder of sun microsystems, bought martins beach for some $ 37 million. Within a year, his management companies had begun locking a gate at the property; it then shut down a parking lot where members of the public had been able to pay a fee to reach the beach. The abrupt change angered surfers and other locals and drew a lawsuit from the surfrider foundation, which said khosla shouldn't be allowed to privatize a beach that people had used regularly for decades. A california court ruled against khosla in 2014; in august 2017, a california appeals court backed that decision, ordering khosla — a venture capitalist who has invested in solar power, biofuels and clean energy — to reopen the beach. \" today's decision is a significant win for beach access rights across the nation, \" said attorney eric buescher, part of the legal team representing surfrider foundation. In a statement released by the group, he added, \" by declining to hear the case, the u.s. Supreme court has rejected the owner's attempt to purchase a public resource. \" to prepare for a potential supreme court showdown, khosla had hired well-known attorney paul clement, a veteran of dozens of cases at the high court, including the challenge to the obama health care overhaul. But",
            "His chances were slim — of the thousands of appeals filed each year, only about 100 are granted review. But he hired a seasoned supreme court lawyer with a record of overcoming the odds and presenting arguments before the nation's top justices. And with conservative interpretations of property rights gaining prominence and president trump's appointment of justice neil m. Gorsuch — and possibly another conservative appointment on the way — legal experts had said that having the right lawyer and a well-crafted argument could have been enough to capture the attention of the justices."

Plus, ratings have been dismal, with fewer than 700,000 tuning in for the premiere. \" oprah will tell lindsay later this month that her show won't be reappearing, \" says one insider, though lilo is for now clueless about her show's future ( unless she happens to google herself today ).

Jurado — whose facebook page is filled with references to firefighting — was spotted at the scene of the fire and his girlfriend was the one to call 911, say officials and relatives. \" i ' m not going to be intimidated, \" walker tells wkbw. \" i ' m not at this point going to resign from doing my job. \" some $ 88,000 has been raised for the family, which lost two cats and all of their belongings.",

According to the new york post, cohen characterized the incident from the bench as nothing more than a \" petty \" slight. Piatek had sued the bar and was seeking unspecified damages. The dispute stemmed from a trip piatek and some friends made to new york to visit the freedom tower and the september 11 memorial and museum.

            "( cnn ) a judge has dismissed a lawsuit by a man who claimed he was unfairly kicked out of a new york city bar for wearing a \" make america great again \" cap. The man, greg piatek of philadelphia, had said he felt \" extremely humiliated \" after being told to leave the happiest hour bar in the city's west village in january 2017 by a manager who told him anyone who supports donald trump is not welcome. But new york state supreme court justice david b. Cohen ruled wednesday that the bar didn't violate the law. \" here the claim that plaintiff was not served and eventually escorted out of the bar because of his perceived support for president trump is not outrageous conduct, \" the judge said in his ruling. According to the new york post, cohen characterized the incident from the bench as nothing more than a \" petty \" slight. Piatek had sued the bar and was seeking unspecified damages. The dispute stemmed from a trip piatek and some friends made to new york to visit the freedom tower and the september 11 memorial and museum. Piatek wore a red \" make america great again \" hat which, according to the court documents, \" holds significant and symbolic import \" to him and \" is an essential component of [ his ] overall personal and spiritual expression",

She had androgen insensitivity syndrome, so that her body resisted male sex hormones called androgens and led to an external appearance of being female. She says her parents agreed, per physician advice, to have her \" healthy gonads \" taken out, \" without my knowledge or consent. \" she was also placed on a lifelong hormone replacement therapy, as her natural hormones had halted. She says these types of \" non-consensual and medically unnecessary procedures \" on intersex kids have been common since the ' 60s, with \" often catastrophic \" results and \" largely unproven \" benefits. \" we are erased before we can even tell our doctors who we are, \" she writes. Zieselman believes most doctors and parents think they're doing the right thing — but she notes the \" devastating impact \" on patients and says \" every human rights organization that has considered this practice has condemned it. \" \" the right thing is to wait until an intersex person can participate in these life-altering decisions, \" she writes.

Because their bodies are unable to respond to certain male sex hormones ( called androgens ), they may have mostly female external sex characteristics or signs of both male and female sexual development. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome occurs when the body cannot use androgens at all. People with this form of the condition have the external sex characteristics of females, but do not have a and therefore do not menstruate and are unable to conceive a child ( infertile ). They are typically raised as females and have a female gender identity. Affected individuals have ( testes ) that are undescended, which means they are abnormally located in the pelvis or abdomen.

Working with catholic charities, in october they adopted a south korean toddler with special needs, whom they named madoc hyeonsu o ' callaghan, according to this obituary. On february 3, the 3-year-old died, with injuries police say were consistent with being beaten, the washington post reports. O ' callaghan, a former marine who served in kosovo and iraq and works at the nsa, has been charged with his murder, and prosecutors have an awful story: they say he beat his son on january 31 or the next day, didn't help him for hours as he cleaned up bodily fluids around the home, and eventually took him to the hospital on february 1. This is \" an absolutely horrific crime on an absolutely innocent young victim, \" says a state's attorney. \" basically this child was beaten to death from head to toe. \" o ' callaghan, who appeared in court yesterday, says the boy slipped in the shower and hit his shoulder on january 31, while his wife was out of town, and that the next day everything seemed fine until the toddler went down for a nap in the afternoon and o ' callaghan noticed pink stains on the bedding and mucus coming from his son's nose. An hour later, he says, the boy was unresponsive and his condition had worsened ( the ap reports that the toddler was vomiting ); he washed him off in the bathtub before taking him to the hospital. A detective says o ' callaghan had no explanation for the injuries shown on the boy's autopsy — including a skull fracture, brain swelling, bruising on the forehead, and \" blunt impact to the back from a linear and triangular shaped object. \" but o ' callaghan's attorney says a ct scan contradicted the autopsy, showing no skull fractures. He adds that his client \" has the unwavering support of his family. \" says o ' callaghan's grandfather, \" i find it impossible to believe, because he's worked so hard to get this baby.

The bad: the 2012 season of the women's professional soccer league has been canceled. At issue is a legal battle with a controversial owner of one of the teams. Dan borislow, who made a fortune with his magicjack internet phone system, was bounced from the league at the end of last season. He's fighting that decision in court, and wps officials are suspending this year's season to \" address the legal issues head-on before moving forward with competition, \" according to a statement. News of the season shutdown followed shortly a 4-0 olympic-qualifying victory over canada by the us women's national team. Wps players abby wambach and alex morgan played a key role in the win, each scoring two goals. Complicating the ongoing league battle are different positions on borislow. He made trouble over everything from team uniforms to stadium advertisements to location ( he moved the washington freedom to florida ), and a union bullying grievance was filed against him, reports the guardian. But wambach supports borislow. \" he's got some ideas up his sleeve and if you know me, i ' m always going to back that guy, \" says wambach, who plugs magicjack on borislow's website.",

            "It should have been a triumphant day for women's soccer in north america – both canada and the us had secured qualification for london 2012 by virtue of advancing to sunday's final of the concacaf olympic qualifying tournament. But less than 24 hours after the us women's national team defeated canada 4-0 to win the tournament, the women's professional soccer ( wps ) announced plans to cancel the 2012 season. Two wps players, abby wambach and alex morgan, played a starring role in usa's win, scoring two goals apiece. Most, if not all, of the vitriol will be hurled in the direction of dan borislow, who owned and operated the magicjack franchise in wps during the 2011 season. The controversial owner, who made a tidy fortune with his magicjack internet phone system, has been involved in a legal battle with the league's owners since they voted to terminate his franchise at the conclusion of the 2011 season. The wps announcement specifically stated that the league is \" suspending the 2012 season in order to address the legal issues head-on before moving forward with competition \". Borislow clashed early and often with the rest of the league since he bought the washington freedom at the end of 2010. After relocating the team to florida, borislow seemed at odds when it came to everything from uniforms, player payments and in-stadium advertisements. Last july, the wps players ' union even filed a grievance against borislow, with accusations of players being bullied. The current legal battle began on october 25, when wps terminated borslow's franchise. It took less than a month for the owner to file a lawsuit seeking reinstatement of the team.

            "It should have been a triumphant day for women's soccer in north america – both canada and the us had secured qualification for london 2012 by virtue of advancing to sunday's final of the concacaf olympic qualifying tournament. But less than 24 hours after the us women's national team defeated canada 4-0 to win the tournament, the women's professional soccer ( wps ) announced plans to cancel the 2012 season. Two wps players, abby wambach and alex morgan, played a starring role in usa's win, scoring two goals apiece. Most, if not all, of the vitriol will be hurled in the direction of dan borislow, who owned and operated the magicjack franchise in wps during the 2011 season. The controversial owner, who made a tidy fortune with his magicjack internet phone system, has been involved in a legal battle with the league's owners since they voted to terminate his franchise at the conclusion of the 2011 season. The wps announcement specifically stated that the league is \" suspending the 2012 season in order to address the legal issues head-on before moving forward with competition \". Borislow clashed early and often with the rest of the league since he bought the washington freedom at the end of 2010. After relocating the team to florida, borislow seemed at odds when it came to everything from uniforms, player payments and in-stadium advertisements. Last july, the wps players ' union even filed a grievance against borislow, with accusations of players being bullied. The current legal battle began on october 25, when wps terminated borslow's franchise. It took less than a month for the owner to file a lawsuit seeking reinstatement of the team. Even in the face of the legal storm, wps appeared to be staying the course. In december, the league received conditional sanctioning from the us soccer federation for the 2012 season, and on january 13, held its annual draft to allocate collegiate stars to the pro ranks.

The deal calls for greater political and economic cooperation, and eventually free trade once a new president is elected in may. Yatsenyuk said the deal indicated that the eu would \" speak in one single and strong voice \" to support the ukraine, cnn reports. As for that other signing? \" frankly, i don't care about russia signing \" the annexation bill, yatsenyuk said. \" i care about ukraine, ukrainians, and our european future. \" in other ukraine news: ukraine set today as the deadline for the militias patrolling independence square in kiev to turn in the illegal weapons that they openly carry, the new york times reports.

In dashboard-cam footage uploaded by local newspaper the victoria advocate, officer nathaniel robinson, who is 23, can be seen slamming pete vasquez on to the hood of the police car. He then puts him in a restrictive hold, before the two abruptly fall out of the camera's field of vision. Soon after, robinson returns into sight holding his stun gun, shouting \"put your hands behind your back. \" police later confirmed the stun gun had been used twice on vasquez. The car was a dealer vehicle, and so vasquez was exempt from being cited. If he had been cited, an expired inspection certificate is a class c misdemeanour. The victoria police chief, jeffrey craig, told the advocate that he was opening an investigation into the incident. \"public trust is extremely important to us. Sometimes that means you have to take a real hard look at some of the actions that occur within the department, \" he said. Craig also apologised to vasquez. Larry urich, a co-worker of vasquez who witnessed the incident, told the guardian that he made robinson aware that the car had dealer plates, and that the expired sticker was not a violation. He said he had called robinson a \"goddamned nazi stormtrooper \". \"it's a tragedy, \" urich said. \"there was absolutely no reason to grab and try and restrain this 76-year-old guy. This was a muscled-up cop who was in absolutely no distress whatsoever. \" urich said that he saw vasquez sunday evening, and that his shoulder, back and arm were hurting. \"i've known the guy for years, \" he said. \"he's a nice, sweet, gentle man. I've never seen him be smart-aleck, or rude to anyone. \" urich said that he had the utmost respect for the victoria police department, but that in his opinion this should be a firing offence for robinson. \"you just don't do this to senior citizens. \""

In dashboard-cam footage uploaded by local newspaper the victoria advocate, officer nathaniel robinson, who is 23, can be seen slamming pete vasquez on to the hood of the police car. He then puts him in a restrictive hold, before the two abruptly fall out of the camera's field of vision. Soon after, robinson returns into sight holding his stun gun, shouting \"put your hands behind your back. \" police later confirmed the stun gun had been used twice on vasquez. The car was a dealer vehicle, and so vasquez was exempt from being cited. If he had been cited, an expired inspection certificate is a class c misdemeanour. The victoria police chief, jeffrey craig, told the advocate that he was opening an investigation into the incident. \"public trust is extremely important to us. Sometimes that means you have to take a real hard look at some of the actions that occur within the department, \" he said. Craig also apologised to vasquez. Larry urich, a co-worker of vasquez who witnessed the incident, told the guardian that he made robinson aware that the car had dealer plates, and that the expired sticker was not a violation. He said he had called robinson a \"goddamned nazi stormtrooper \". \"it's a tragedy, \" urich said. \"there was absolutely no reason to grab and try and restrain this 76-year-old guy. This was a muscled-up cop who was in absolutely no distress whatsoever. \" urich said that he saw vasquez sunday evening, and that his shoulder, back and arm were hurting. \"i've known the guy for years, \" he said. \"he's a nice, sweet, gentle man. I've never seen him be smart-aleck, or rude to anyone. \" urich said that he had the utmost respect for the victoria police department, but that in his opinion this should be a firing offence for robinson. \"you just don't do this to senior citizens. \""

A new wave of seed varieties were deposited that hail from more than 100 countries and represent a \" sort of winter olympics of crop diversity, \" per the director of the trust that maintains the facility. Among them: varieties of japanese barley that will ensure the world won't lose its access to miso should disaster strike, reports the independent. Samples of that key miso ingredient, along with brazil's \" common bean, \" a rare tennessean red okra, and nearly 200 types of wild potato have been added to the 820,619 samples that have been placed in the vault since it opened in 2008. It was constructed to hold up to 4.5 million seed samples, and sees one to two new deliveries each year, notes the guardian. The doomsday vault, more formally known as the svalbard global seed vault, functions as a sort of backup, holding duplicates of seed samples otherwise housed in gene banks around the world. But this location is about as secure as possible: it sits within a mountain on a remote island in the svalbard archipelago, between norway and the north pole, behind four sets of air-locked doors. It can weather nuclear war, an asteroid strike, and climate change. That hardiness likely influenced japan's decision to send seeds for the first time. The bbc reports that the 2011 earthquake and tsunami convinced the barley germplasm center at okayama university to pony up 575 samples after realizing its own storehouse wasn't impenetrable.",

Early last week, joaquin guzman is believed to have escaped just minutes ahead of mexican authorities, using a network of tunnels under the streets of culiacan, headquarters of his sinaloa cartel. Us officials had traced guzman to his hideout using a number on a phone seized in a raid earlier this month, the wall street journal reports. Guzman's escape was short-lived: using the same number, authorities were able to track him to the resort city of mazatlan, where he was finally arrested after 13 years on the run. The arrest of a senior aide the day after guzman's narrow escape also provided key clues, and a wiretap being monitored by immigration and customs enforcement provided the final breakthrough, the ap finds. A senior us official tells reuters that another key break in the case came last fall, when a phone belonging to the son of guzman's deputy was seized at the us-mexico border. \" we handled this case like we handled many: using technology to work up the chain, person by person, to the top, \" he says. Guzman is now being held in an underground cell while mexico and the us work out who gets to prosecute him.",

The study, led by the co-director of the cardiovascular research institute at the lehigh valley health network, involved 3,800 runners who supplied info on their heart risk factors and their use of nsaids like ibuprofen; almost 70 % of the group clocked more than 20 miles a week. The findings were presented sunday, but have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. According to the results, how much should you run? one cardiologist who reviewed the data suggests you do so no more than 2.5 hours per week, spread out between two or three sessions consisting of slow or moderately-paced running. It's not clear why too much running might be bad for longevity, but the study appears to rule out factors like prior cardiac risk ( linked to things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, family history, and smoking ) or excessive use of nsaids ( which have been linked to heart problems ). One doctor who's also a running coach tells nbc san diego that extreme exercise can actually \" cause some scarring of the heart. \" and another recent study found that male marathon runners had more plaque in their coronary arteries — which can lead to a heart attack — than non-runners, pioneer press reports.

        "summary": "Guys, if you've ever wished you could look into a crystal ball and see if hair plugs are in your future, scientists have good news. Using data from 53,000 men in the uk, they've come up with a dna-based algorithm that could someday predict whether one is likely to go bald — one that's more reliable than family history. More to the point for those worried about it is the second half of this sentence: \" the results of this study might help identify those at greatest risk of hair loss, and also potential genetic targets for intervention, \" says a study co-author, per nbc news. In the study, the largest such one of male-pattern baldness to date, university of edinburgh researchers identified 287 genetic markers linked to hair loss, per a release. That's quite a step up, given that only eight such markers had been previously identified, reports live science. \" we are still a long way from making an accurate prediction for an individual's hair-loss pattern, \" says co-author riccardo marioni. \" however, these results take us one step closer \" and \" pave the way for an improved understanding of the genetic causes. \" for now, researchers say their algorithm can be applied only to groups of people, but they hope to fine-tune it, perhaps by factoring in ages at the onset of baldness in future studies. Another of the researchers points to a notable factor: \" it was interesting to find that many of the genetics signals for male pattern baldness came from the x chromosome, which men inherit from their mothers. \" that suggests the maternal side is more to blame than previously thought, notes seeker. ( an alleged rogaine thief had a predictable mugshot. )",

The sun has graphic images of the incident, both during and after the goring, which led to navarrete being impaled about 6 inches into his throat by the 1,000-pound-plus animal; he reportedly sustained injuries to his tongue and the roof of his mouth. Reuters says he was also pierced about 4 inches in the leg before fellow matadors, as seen in the video shown here, rushed in to get the bull away from him. Unilad, which reports this was navarrete's debut appearance, says many in the audience thought they were going to watch the bull maul navarrete to death right in front of them. Navarrete is also said to be contending with a broken collarbone and sliced sciatic nerves; the las ventas ring said monday in a statement he was recuperating after surgery the day before.

She is recovering at home and will work from there next week, says the state department, adding that clinton had been dehydrated because of a stomach virus. The development means that clinton will not testify as scheduled on thursday before a senate panel on the benghazi attacks. Instead, deputies thomas nides and william burns will take her place. Clinton also was to testify before a house panel the same day, and that is presumably canceled as well. \" senator kerry was relieved to hear that the secretary is on the mend, but he insisted that given her condition, she could not and should not appear on thursday, \" said a statement from john kerry, who chairs the foreign relations committee. Earlier this week, clinton canceled an overseas trip because of the stomach virus, and daily intel noted at the time that it was probably a wise move — because clinton, 65, once fainted mid-speech in 2005, thanks to a stomach virus.",

Abdullah bin laden asked for the certificate in the aftermath of the raid that killed his father, but a general counsel at the american embassy in riyadh informed him that he was out of luck. Glen keiser wrote that no death certificate existed, as is \" consistent with regular practice for individuals killed in the course of military operations. \" but he suggested an alternative: noting that the us had closed the criminal case against bin laden because he was dead, keiser wrote that abdullah bin laden could request the order making that closure official, something called an order of \" nolle prosequi \" ( \" we shall no longer prosecute \" ). That would be the closest thing to proof of death. He even provided the necessary request form, adding, \" i hope that these u.s.

Not that there's anything wrong with that, writes aj daulerio on deadspin: in both new york and new jersey, where the romancing allegedly occurred, it's perfectly legal for a 24-year-old man to date a 17-year-old girl. The girl in question, whom daulerio refers to only as ek, reached out to deadspin with her story before changing her mind and deciding she didn't want the infamy that would come along with its publication — but that didn't stop deadspin from running it. Ek claims she met sanchez while partying at a manhattan nightclub on dec. 31, and that she was upfront with him about her age. Sanchez texted her and she freaked out about it on facebook ( deadspin has a screenshot; click to see ), then he gave her tickets to the bills-jets game. Ultimately, they had a dinner date in new york and then they, in daulerio's words, \"hooked up. \" ek says they \"went back to his place in jersey after dinner, \" and as proof, she offers pictures of what she claims is sanchez's room. After that, a few more 2am text messages followed, and, at least until recently, ek said she was still \"close \" with sanchez, although she doesn't think he's \"necessarily good to women. \" ( this is hardly the only recent juicy jets story; click for more of the team's tabloid-worthy incidents. )",

        "summary": "You know there's a problem if you start coughing up blood — but how to react when you start sweating blood? per the cbc, a 21-year-old italian woman got to a hospital asap, and now doctors are puzzling over her \" most unusual \" case of bleeding from her face and palms, a condition she'd apparently suffered from for three years. While the case study published in the canadian medical association journal doesn't reveal much detail about the woman herself, it notes she was diagnosed with hematohidrosis, a rare condition in which blood is excreted or sweated out through pores or unbroken skin ( ie, it's not coming out through a cut or other injury ). The patient tends to break out in the bloody sweating when she's either asleep or doing something physical, and the condition seems to get worse when she's stressed. An episode can last up to five minutes. Per ctv news, doctors say the woman's condition is embarrassing enough to her that she became \" socially isolated \" and showed depression and panic disorder symptoms. Although it's still not known what spurs such bleeding, different theories have emerged, including blood coagulation disorders or an overactive nervous system that reacts when a patient is under stress. A toronto hematologist thinks this particular patient has \" a very bizarre anatomical defect on a microscopic level \" that's causing her bleeding, perhaps in her sweat ducts. A medical historian tells the cbc she was at first wary anyone could actually sweat blood, but after research reaching back to aristotle's time ( and her find of nearly 20 cases since 2000 ), she now believes the condition exists. The patient has since been administered a heart and blood pressure med that has cut down — though not eliminated — her bleeding. ( here's what life is like when you're allergic to your own sweat. )",

            "Europe led the way last year in facing down the global financial crisis, restructuring our banking system and strengthening the global financial system. The european union was also at the forefront in calling for a new forum for economic cooperation of g-20 leaders. And from the outset of the crisis, it was europe that promoted the fiscal stimulus — and sought to coordinate it globally — that has been a major factor in preventing recession becoming a world-wide depression. Now we need to once again lead the way in forging a new global consensus. Stable, open and competitive european financial markets are essential to global growth. We recognize the importance to europe of ensuring that we have globally competitive financial services, and the importance of developing world-class financial centers such as london and paris. But the way global financial institutions have operated raises fundamental questions that we must — and can only — address globally. We have found that a huge and opaque global trading network involving complex products, short-termism and too-often excessive rewards created risks that few people understood. We have also learned that when crises happen, taxpayers have to cover the costs. It is simply not acceptable for them to foot the bill for losses in a deep downturn, while institutions'shareholders and employees enjoy all the gains as the economy recovers. Better regulation and supervision are the means by which the risk to the taxpayer can be reduced for the longer term. In regard to regulation, the eu has adopted a comprehensive set of new rules for the financial sector to avoid the repetition of the crisis: control over credit rating agencies, stronger capital requirements on complex products such as securitization, and strengthened deposit guarantee schemes. We have set up strict rules to make sure that compensation systems avoid excessive risk taking. We will also implement stricter capital rules for banks. We also have agreed on a more efficient system for supervision of the financial sector within europe to better monitor systemic risks, to ensure that eu regulation is applied consistently, to settle disagreement between national supervisors, and to deal with crisis situations"

Authorities say the infant — full term but likely less than a day old, with the umbilical cord and placenta still attached, per wgn — had perhaps been left outside overnight and spent hours in the sun before elysia found her while playing outside monday morning. Her mom, heidi laub, \" realized exactly what she had found, \" lake county sheriff john buncich tells abc 7. Laub says there were maggots on the placenta, per patch.com. But except for sunburns, the child was in good health, buncich says. The baby was found about 100 yards from the nearest road in a \" very rural area, \" he adds, per the post-tribune. \" if the 9-year-old wouldn't have gone outside, this could've had a very different outcome. \" he calls elysia a \" guardian angel. \" elysia says she had help: \" i didn't do this myself. \" god \" put me in that place. \" authorities say the caucasian baby with brownish-blonde hair, referred to as \" miracle baby jane doe, \" will be sent to a foster home while officers search for her mother, who could face criminal charges. Indiana has a safe haven law allowing mothers to leave infants less than 30 days old at hospitals and police and fire stations without question.

His group claimed responsibility for a 2009 blast at a siberian hydroelectric plant and an explosion on a russian train, both of which killed dozens. Umarov said he was behind suicide bombings in 2010 on the moscow subway and, the next year, at a moscow airport. Last year, he was said to be involved in an alleged plot to kill vladimir putin. The recent attacks bear umarov's hallmarks, an expert tells the christian science monitor: \" the use of women, the use of simultaneous attacks, the use of hitting transportation infrastructure, the repetition of it, these are all the leitmotifs of his work. \"",

Both incidents happened in one week. School officials are now asking parents to pay attention to where they are keeping their recreational marijuana after the fourth graders brought the items to monfort elementary school in greeley. John gates, director of safety for weld county school district 6, said there were four students involved — three boys and a girl. The students were all 10. Gates said the students faced tough discipline but not suspension or expulsion but would not provide specific details on their punishment. One boy admitted to taking a small bite of the candy bar but he didn't get sick, and a medical exam showed he didn't suffer any harmful side effects.

            "April 23, 2014 11: 47 pm greeley, colo. ( cbs4 ) – a school in greeley is asking parents to be more vigilant after a 10-year-old boy admitted to selling marijuana to other students on the playground and another student came to school with a marijuana edible candy bar. Both incidents happened in one week. School officials are now asking parents to pay attention to where they are keeping their recreational marijuana after the fourth graders brought the items to monfort elementary school in greeley. John gates, director of safety for weld county school district 6, said there were four students involved — three boys and a girl. The students were all 10. Gates said the students faced tough discipline but not suspension or expulsion but would not provide specific details on their punishment. One boy admitted to taking a small bite of the candy bar but he didn't get sick, and a medical exam showed he didn't suffer any harmful side effects. Gates said the boys told them they got the pot from home. That marijuana appears to have been legally purchased by adults. The grandparents in two families apparently made the purchases.

        "summary": "It's a safe bet that any ground turkey you buy at the supermarket is laden with potentially dangerous bacteria, says consumer reports. Its first report on turkey meat gets off to a happy start by noting that \" more than half of the packages of raw ground meat and patties tested positive for fecal bacteria. \" the magazine tested for five organisms — enterococcus, e. Coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella, and campylobacter — and at least one showed up in 90 % of the 257 samples, reports cbs news. Cr says most of the contaminants it found were resistant to common antibiotics and blamed the overuse of drugs in feedlots. Products labeled \" organic \" or \" no antibiotics \" fared much better in this area, and the magazine encouraged their use. The turkey-meat industry is lashing back at what it calls a \" misleading \" and too-small study. Of the contaminants found, it writes, \" the two most prevalent, enterococcus and generic e.coli, are not considered sources of foodborne illness. \" it also notes that only 5 % of the samples tested positive for salmonella, adding: \" this is borne out by more extensive government testing, which finds almost 90 % of all ground turkey and 97 % of whole turkeys are salmonella-free. \" at the wall street journal, tom gara isn't exactly bowled over by that argument. \" you know it's a tough news day when an industry association boasts its product is almost 90 % salmonella-free. \"",

        "summary": "Rolling out what the ap calls \" the toughest dui limit \" in the country, utah lawmakers have brought a new measure to the governor's desk that would limit a driver's legal blood-alcohol content to 0.05 %. House bill 155 — which would go into effect right before new year's eve on dec. 30, 2018, if gov. Gary herbert signs off — passed in the state senate wednesday, fox 13 reports. Herbert's office informed the station he would indeed approve the measure. All other states currently have dui limits set at 0.08 % ( though the ap notes that limit may vary for commercial drivers and those who have past duis ), which would make utah's the lowest in the country once it's given the governor's ok. The national transportation safety board wants all states to follow suit, notes the salt lake tribune. Republican rep. Norman thurston, the bill's sponsor, compares the new limit to lower ones in canada and some eu countries, asserting the measure will cut down on deaths. But critics say the ceiling — which the american beverage institute says a 120-pound woman may hit after just one drink, depending on how much she's eaten — will mar the state's hospitality and tourism industries and make the mormon-leaning state look more \" peculiar \" to outsiders, as one senator put it. The managing director of the abi also argues that most dui-related deaths are tied to drivers who well exceed legal limits. Still, the law may keep those who've imbibed from \" getting behind the wheel in the first place, \" says gop senate majority whip stuart adams. ( an alcohol-gauging tat, maybe? )",

They made their allegations during a 20-minute federal hearing where the suspect, omar gonzalez, was ordered held until oct. 1 pending the dismissal of a bond in another arrest, the washington post reports. In that earlier incident, gonzalez allegedly had a sawed off shotgun, two powerful rifles, four handguns, and other guns and ammunition in his ford bronco when troopers stopped him in southwestern virginia on july 19. Officials say gonzalez initially tried to flee troopers, weaving and driving onto a highway median. He was arrested at the scene after a trooper found the illegal shotgun in his car. Gonzalez also had a map of washington, dc, and camping equipment. In another incident, gonzalez was apparently walking by the white house with a hatchet in his waistband and was stopped by secret service officers but not detained. Gonzalez's white house break-in — for which he faces up to 10 years in prison — has triggered a review of how the us secret service failed to stop him. Today the secret service beefed up its presence around the white house, cnn reports. ( gonzalez's relatives say he has ptsd and needs help. )",

As she drove, cavallo watched as the boy climbed over a guardrail and jumped several feet down. The seven-year police veteran followed right behind the boy and jumped down herself, a risky move that would ultimately pay off. Per news12, a second woman — this one in a military uniform — stopped to assist and the two women began to give the unresponsive boy cpr and strap on a neck brace. The boy was then rushed to a hospital, where he was treated for broken bones. He is expected to survive. As for cavallo, she said she just went to work and about her day as usual after the jarring experience. \" i went to work and worked to 11pm, \" she told the journal news on sunday. \" i didn't realize what was going on until yesterday.

After a huge boom-and-bust cycle in the 1990s, the world's telecommunications cables are full, so once again ships are braving the oceans to lay new batches of the mammoth fiber optic wires that undergird the modern economy and allow you to order all sorts of useless stuff. Author andrew blum, who has a new book on the subject ( tubes ), offers an overview in the wall street journal. Brazil-to-angola; virginia beach-to-san sebastian, spain; and new york-to-london ( of course ) are three of the new cables going in. Undersea cables pass through power repeaters every 50 miles on their immense journeys, ending at a \" beach manhole \" where the cable is secured to the land. Near the manhole is a landing station, responsible for sending and receiving the signals. And the cables, signals, and equipment are all run in a complicated cross-owned and -leased network of companies. It's all about capacity and speed, as the latest new york-london route is being carefully planned to shave 310 miles off the distance — and save high-speed traders a precious 5.2 milliseconds.",

The authors go on to express their support for local law enforcement and first responders, who they say are the ones who displayed the \" courage, humanity, and honor we must exhibit in such difficult times. \" the official letter comes one day after mcb secretary general harun khan told reporters that \" the level of our anger \" was so great that some had started saying \" these people should be denied an islamic burial. \" cnn notes that mosques in both the uk and the us have turned their backs on burying terrorists after attacks in the recent past.

While making margaritas outside with bride-to-be alyse golden over memorial day weekend, a little lime juice dripped down his fingers and hands and onto his arm as he was squeezing the limes. A day later, the man from jacksonville, fla., noticed red burns developing on his skin, and within 48 hours, a huge blister also appeared, first coast news reports. Er doctors told peers he had fallen victim to a little-known reaction caused when citric acid mixes with the sun's rays, dubbed \" margarita dermatitis, \" or \" lime disease. \" essentially, the acid makes skin hypersensitive to sunlight, and exposure can cause nasty burns, blisters, or brown spots, the daily express and women's health report. It isn't just limes you need to watch out for: lemons, carrots, celery, bergamot oranges, parsnips, and dill can also inflame the skin. Dr. Douglas robins says he sees about a dozen patients each year affected by what is officially known as phytophotodermatitis and that it can take years to bleach skin back to normal. While some people react differently, \" everyone is susceptible. \" left with second-degree burns, peers says photoshop will be a big help for wedding photos. \" the blistering is gone and now i ' m left with really bright pink skin, \" he says, adding his wedding ring might not make it on his finger. \" tried it on the other day.

        "summary": "Another blow for lionel messi: the star soccer player was sentenced to 21 months in jail for tax fraud in a barcelona court wednesday, but don't expect that to keep him from the soccer field. Messi is unlikely to serve time behind bars since jail sentences under two years in spain can be served under probation for first-time offenders, reports the bbc. He does, however, face $ 2.2 million in fines for using tax havens in belize and uruguay to hide millions from image rights, per the telegraph. Prosecutors argued $ 4.5 million was moved to switzerland and britain, then to offshore companies in belize and uruguay from 2007 to 2009, reports usa today. During testimony last month, however, messi said he \" had no idea where the money was going, \" per the telegraph. \" i just concentrated on playing football. I trusted my father. \" messi's father, jorge messi, was also found guilty of tax fraud and sentenced to 21 months, though he's not expected to serve time, either. He must pay $ 1.6 million.",

        "summary": "Tom brady filed an appeal just days after the league suspended him for four games over deflategate — but the patriots have given up and won't be fighting the league's punishment, cbs news reports. In a five-minute press conference today out of san francisco, where the league is holding spring meetings, owner robert kraft said even though he found the discipline — a $ 1 million fine and two lost draft picks, including one in the first round — \" unreasonable and unprecedented, \" he \" reluctantly \" conceded that dropping the appeal would be best for all involved, nesn reports. \" the entire process is taking way too long, \" he said. \" i can end [ this controversy ] or extend it. \" this followed an espn report that kraft and nfl commissioner roger goodell were having \" back-channel conversations \" to avoid legal action. Although mmqb compared the goodell-kraft relationship to that of obama-putin, there have been signs the chill was thawing: espn's adam schefter tweeted this morning that the two were spotted hugging it out. But a league source reportedly told schefter that the nfl asked the patriots to suspend jim mcnally and john jastremski ( the two employees whose texts allegedly pointed to deflating ) before the pats received their punishment, and that the team \" obliged, \" as espn puts it — which wouldn't make a lot of sense if there's no proof of ball deflation, as the pats keep insisting. An nfl rep denies espn's report. Meanwhile, mmqb asked kraft in an \" alternately defiant and angry \" phone call over the weekend why he suspended the two, and kraft \" refused comment — for what he claimed were a variety of reasons, \" the site notes.

Haynes by his stage name, nelly, and realize that it would take just a few minutes on spotify to help dig the rapper out of his irs mess. Tmz reported sunday that nelly was slammed with a $ 2,412,283 federal tax lien last month, added on to a missouri state tax bill from earlier this year of nearly $ 150,000 ( he originally owed just $ 113,000 and change, but the interest racked up ). Spin magazine calls his financial conundrum \" tragic \" and says the singer \" deserves better \" — and it suggests a way everyone can help. The magazine's grand plan: get as many people as possible to stream his hit song \" hot in herre \" — or \" ride wit me \" or any other tunes from the nelly discography — to generate funds for the artist. Based on spotify's estimation that the average \" per stream \" payout to the owner of a song's rights is between $ 0.006 and $ 0.0084, spin calculates nelly would need, at minimum, 287,176,547 streams to help him pay down the federal tax bill, with an additional 17.8 million streams to appease missouri — and that's if we assume he's on the $ 0.0084 end of things and that his labels and publishers, who would also get a cut, will be generous. Still, hope springs eternal: people are responding in a generally positive manner to the #hotinherrestreamingparty and #savenelly hashtags. \" i couldn't save harambe but god ---- it i ' m saving you @nelly_mo, \" writes one fan.

Major surgical errors are pretty rare — some estimates put them at one in 12,000 surgeries — but they do happen, even egregious ones like leaving instruments behind or performing the wrong surgery altogether.

Reporting in the journal surgery, they found that \" never events \" ( meaning ones that should never happen ) occurred once in every 22,000 surgeries in this window, and that those included 24 wrong surgeries, 22 involving the wrong side or site, 18 instances of leaving an object in the patient, and five wrong implants. The researchers used the human factors analysis and classification system — initially developed to investigate military aviation accidents — and organized errors into four types, reports the mayo clinic: preconditions for action, like overconfidence and inadequate communication; unsafe actions, like breaking rules or confirmation bias; oversight factors, like poor staffing and planning; and organizational influences, such as problems with operational processes. They found that most major errors involve an average of nine missteps, and that mental states of doctors and nurses ( e.g., overconfidence and stress ) were the most common source of errors, reports pacific standard. And while they didn't get specific on how to mitigate these errors, they did note that lightening the workload should ease the error rate. ( hospitals appear to profit from these mistakes. )",

She even hesitated to keep reporting on issues like government corruption and the panama papers. \" the dehumanization by the time she was killed around that period was complete, \" says her son paul. It turns out that galizia, like many reporters and activists worldwide, was targeted by a government-backed troll army designed to intimidate and discredit her in a cyber-world with few enforceable boundaries, bloomberg reports. A new report by a global research group shows how countries are using such trolls to squelch dissent, often via fake social-media accounts, using various kinds of labor — like party youth groups, volunteer armies, government workers, or paid contractors who specialize in trolling. In india, prime minister modi's bjp party apparently had a troll farm threatening opponents with \" slaughter \" during the 2014 election. In turkey, president erdogan's party lured critics into downloading software that secretly monitored their communications and movements, per accessnow. Similar online horrors have cropped up in ecuador, venezuela, and — with russian trolling against hillary clinton during the 2016 election — the us as well.

        "summary": "Anyone who's struggled with mood swings while on hormonal birth control may not be surprised to hear that a new study suggests using such birth control could increase the risk of depression. Researchers from the university of copenhagen looked at more than a million women ages 15 to 34, about 55 % of whom were using hormonal contraception or had been on it during the past six months. ( often, people who quit birth control due to depressive symptoms aren't included in such studies, and the scientists wanted to make sure that wasn't the case for this one, health.com reports. ) the scientists theorize that progesterone, as well as the synthetic version of the hormone, progestin, has something to do with the development of depression. They found that women on a progestin-only pill were 34 % more likely to have been prescribed an antidepressant than women who weren't on hormonal contraception, and women who were on a pill containing both progestin and estrogen were 23 % more likely. In addition, women who were using a progestin-only iud were 40 % more likely, women using a vaginal ring containing hormones were 60 % more likely, and women using a patch containing hormones were 100 % more likely, the researchers report in their paper, published in jama psychiatry. The numbers are even more striking when teens are isolated: teenage girls who were on progestin-only pills were 120 % more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant than non-users, or 80 % more likely if they were on a combined pill; for those on non-oral hormonal contraception, the risk was multiplied by three. This is possibly because teens are already more susceptible to depression, the new york times reports. \" doctors should ensure that women, especially young women, are not already depressed or have a history of depression \" before prescribing hormonal birth control, the lead author tells health.com.

        "summary": "A pregnant alabama woman who suffered a miscarriage at six weeks can sue her doctor for wrongful death, the alabama supreme court has ruled, with judges citing a 2009 state law making it a crime to kill or harm \" an unborn child in utero at any stage of development. \" physicians who make mistakes are usually protected from civil suits, and a lower court in august dismissed the wrongful death portion of kimberly stinnett's claim. But the high court overruled that last week in a unanimous decision that \" reaffirms the principle that unborn children are protected by alabama's wrongful-death statute from the moment life begins, \" writes judge tom parker, per al.com. The ruling is a swipe at roe v. Wade, which parker has previously called \" incoherent \" because \" life begins at conception. \" the case goes back to may 2012, when stinnett sought treatment for abdominal cramps and fever. An er obstetrician who treated her suspected an ectopic pregnancy and performed a dilation and curettage, al.com reports, followed by an injection of a drug intended to stop the pregnancy. The helena woman had a history of two miscarriages and one ectopic pregnancy. A follow-up ultrasound by stinnett's regular ob-gyn showed the pregnancy was uterine but failing, possibly because of the injection. In june, stinnett miscarried and filed a civil lawsuit against the doctor who first treated her. Propublica has written that parker's writings pose \" the biggest threat to abortion in a generation, \" but the ruling was cheered by the chair of liberty counsel \" for defending the legal rights of the unborn as clearly stated in alabama law. \" ( a study finds a miscarriage can be followed by ptsd. )",

            "A helena woman can proceed with a wrongful death claim against a doctor for her miscarriage when she was about six weeks pregnant, the alabama supreme court ruled friday in reversing a jefferson county judge's order that dismissed her claim. One justice, outspoken in the past in his views against roe v. Wade, said the decision reaffirms the alabama supreme court's previous ruling that children are protected by alabama's wrongful-death law from the point of conception. Justices ruled a circuit judge had erred when he said the doctor was immune from civil lawsuits for wrongful death involving the death of a fetus that had not yet reached the stage of viability. The state's wrongful death act extends immunity from criminal prosecution to doctors for \" a mistake or unintentional error causing the death of a pre-viable fetus. \" but the judge, based on previous rulings, had extended that to also include immunity from civil lawsuits. The decision by the alabama supreme court allowing the wrongful death claim to proceed to trial was unanimous, with all eight justices of the current court concurring in the result.

            "In 2005, the witherspoon school of law and public policy held a conference in virginia's blue ridge mountains. The school's name was something of a misnomer: rather than grant jds, witherspoon staged seminars and lectures offering lessons in what it summarized as \"the comprehensive biblical foundation for our common law and constitutional government. \" its target audience was homeschooled young men. The school itself was a project of vision forum, a texas-based ministry whose founder was also a leader in the christian patriarchy movement, which preaches, among other things, that husbands should vote for their wives. Most sitting judges would go to great pains to avoid such a gathering. But tom parker, then a few months into his first term on the alabama supreme court, gladly accepted an invitation to speak at that year's witherspoon retreat. Before his election to alabama's highest court, parker had been an aide-de-camp to chief justice roy moore, whose installation of a granite ten commandments monument in the state judiciary building had touched off what became for alabama both a considerable embarrassment and a genuine constitutional crisis. At parker's swearing-in, he made it clear that he had sought the bench to continue his old boss's spiritual fight. \"the very god of holy scriptures, the creator, is the source of law, life",
