Pistorius lawyer barry roux paraded his client in front of the pretoria court so his \" enemies \" could see how much trouble he would have had in confronting an intruder, per the wall street journal — pistorius claimed he shot steenkamp in error through a locked bathroom door, thinking the person on the other side had broken into his home — and how fearful and vulnerable he would've been due to his disability. Reuters describes pistorius ' body as \" shaking with emotion \" as he took off his prosthetics and stood in front of the court; cnn says he fell to his knees crying after a few minutes. The dramatic scene of the \" trembling \" 29-year-old, as the new york times puts it, who stands 3 ½ feet tall without his artificial legs, was a defense strategy to avoid a 15-year minimum prison sentence, which the judge has some leeway with based on time served and other \" mitigating factors, \" per the bbc. Pistorius has already served one year under the original culpable homicide conviction — that was overturned by an appeals court, which convicted him of murder in december — and has been serving the rest of that five-year sentence under house arrest. But steenkamp's family isn't buying his vulnerability gambit, saying he still hasn't apologized to them and that they're furious he wouldn't testify at the hearing but saw fit to tape an interview about the killing for the itv network that will air june 24. Prosecutor gerrie nel responded to pistorius ' ploy by requesting the public release of pictures of a bloodied steenkamp, which the judge granted. Sentencing is july 6.",

The first requires that players show their outstretched hands to their opponents before reaching into the tile bag so that others are sure they're not palming secret tiles; the second mandates players must hold the tile bag at shoulder height while making their selection so they can't purposely, or even accidentally, see any of the tiles. Although simmons, 60, says he's never intentionally cheated, he does concede that the distraction of the game may have led to his inadvertently flouting those rules from time to time. \" at the top level, games can be quite intense and there's a lot going through one's mind, let alone remembering to religiously ensure tile drawing rules are followed meticulously, \" he notes. Simmons has long history with the game, notes scotland's sunday herald, reaching back to the mid- ' 70s and including appearances at five world championships. An initial complaint against simmons was brought in june by player lewis mackay, which spurred a yearlong ban by the association of british scrabble players — and then prompted further inquiry leading to an extended three-year ban. Simmons, who says he won't appeal, tells the times he'd been thinking of packing it in anyway due to the \" long drives \" to competitions, the studying, and the stress. \" i will rise above this issue and get on with more important things in life than playing scrabble, \" he notes.

Shannon bennett and her husband say they painted the letters in support of rep. Beto o ' rourke, the democratic challenger of sen. Ted cruz, to prevent sign stealing in a heavily pro-cruz neighborhood in katy, texas. But before they had finished the sign sunday night, the chesterfield community association's president drove up and gave them a piece of his mind: \" he was very hostile, \" bennett, 48, tells the star-telegram. \" this is truly a shock, that they became so angry. \" the association left them a notice tuesday saying they had violated the hoa's landscaping code by creating a political sign \" attached to plant material, \" abc 13 reports. Bennett says it was \" clearly written in a fit of rage \" and gave them two different schedules by which to remove the sign unless they appeal the ruling within 30 days. So she called the community manager and said she would request a hearing, per the houston chronicle. According to texas property code, an hoa can't stop the posting of \" one or more signs advertising a political candidate \" but can impose restrictions about signs attached to plants or bigger than four by six feet. And the bennetts'sign ( see it here ) is a big one. But bennett is standing by their work: \" we wanted to be creative, \" she says. ( see what o ' rourke called cruz in their recent debate. )",

But he boasts that it would shave off $ 6.2 trillion over the next decade, balancing the budget by 2015. The budget would: roll domestic spending back to 2008 levels and freeze it there, proposing cuts in agriculture subsidies and the federal workforce, among other things. Reform welfare with cuts to the food-stamp program and the consolidation of several job training programs into a \"career scholarships \" one. Scale back \"corporate welfare, \" starting with the conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac. But at the same time it would … reduce the top corporate tax rate, and the top tax rate for the wealthy, to 25 %. Ryan says this will be \"revenue neutral \" because the budget also eliminates \"a burdensome tangle of deductions and loopholes. \" replace the current medicaid system with a block grant that shifts control to the states replace medicare with a system that subsidizes the private plan of seniors ' choosing repeal and defund the president's health care reform law. The budget has essentially no chance of becoming law, but, like the president's budget before it, could serve as a touchstone in the coming debate. \"the president's budget was a safe budget, \" one gop rep tells politico. \"this budget is not a safe budget. \"",

            "Republicans and democrats stumbled one day closer to a government shutdown on friday, as the two parties escalated what has become a broader battle over washington's role in the u.s. Economy. Wsj's david wessel looks at ongoing talks between republicans and democrats that aim to stave off a u.s. Government shutdown this coming friday evening at midnight. The two fights — one over funding the government for the next six months, the other over a sweeping plan to reshape the government for decades to come — showed how far apart the two parties are on basic fiscal issues ahead of the 2012 elections.

Whether we cut $ 33 billion or $ 61 billion — that is, whether we shave 2 % or 4 % off of this year's deficit — is important.

But this morning the new house republican majority will introduce a budget that moves the debate from billions in spending cuts to trillions. America is facing a defining moment. The threat posed by our monumental debt will damage our country in profound ways, unless we act. No one person or party is responsible for the looming crisis.

Lumber liquidators, which stopped selling the lumber soon after last year's 60 minutes report, says in a statement the cdc's \" revised calculation overestimates any potential health risks from these products, and we are encouraged that [ the ] cdc is seeking a broader review of their conclusions. \" this isn't the only hit to its reputation: the company recently agreed to settle for $ 13 million, plus a five-year probationary period, for bringing in wood from forests that serve as home for endangered species, per usa today.

        "summary": "The universe is smiling down on us — almost literally. The hubble telescope has captured a \" smiley face \" in space: two bright yellow eyes ( a cluster of galaxies called sdss j1038+4849 ), a white nose, and a faint smile and incomplete circle around the entire face. But those curving lines \" don't exist — or at least not in the form that we see them in the photo, \" writes michelle starr at cnet. As spacetelescope.org reports, galaxy clusters have a mammoth gravitational pull, and at slate, astronomer phil plait explains why in pretty easy-to-understand terms: the cluster holds trillions of stars, which is \" a lot of mass, and a lot of gravity. \" j1038 is roughly 4.5 billion light-years away, and past it, at a distance of 7.5 billion light-years, are additional galaxies. When those galaxies ' light passes through the area that's been altered by the cluster's gravity, the light is bent. The phenomenon is called gravitational lensing, and the \" strongest \" example of it is called an einstein ring, as in the hubble image. As starr writes, such rings \" only occur when the source of the original light, gravitational lens, and observer are in exact alignment in a straight line. \" though the observer in this case was hubble, the image surfaced thanks to judy schmidt, who submitted the image via the \" hubble's hidden treasures \" effort, which invites armchair astronomers to search the massive hubble archive for \" iconic \" photos the public has never seen. This image was released by nasa yesterday. The phenomenon of seeing non-existent faces in things — it's known as face pareidolia — has been known for centuries, and last year, researchers confirmed that it's perfectly normal and relates to how our brains are wired. Among the better-known instances of this occurring: the \" virgin mary tree, \" \" google earth jesus, \" and \" griddle virgin. \"",

This strange and convoluted conspiracy theory, which also involves allegations of occult rituals, has its origins in false accusations about the clintons that began spreading in late october. The original theory claimed that the clintons and other government figures were involved in a global human trafficking and pedophilia ring. This one example shows how trump supporters, members of 4chan and reddit, and right-wing blogs in the us and in other countries combined to create and spread viral misinformation during the election season.

Well, customers \" whore \" and \" dummy \" beg to differ, along with another who suspects his name was changed to a version of \" f --- you. \" in a new post, elliott writes that he has been contacted by several people since his initial post to share similar stories. One is julie swano, who was addressed as \" whore \" on her bill in december until she got the company to change it back this month. Another is carolina heredia. \" they changed my name to 'dummy ' in my online account, so that the greeting was 'hello, dummy, ' \" she says. ( both showed their altered greetings to elliott. ) sako bezdjian says that after his father canceled some services, the name on his bill was inexplicably changed from garbis bezdjian to \" fakoe bez, \" which he takes for an f-word slam. A comcast exec tells elliott the company will follow up with all such cases that surface. \"we're retraining our teams on the importance of making name changes properly, \" he says. \"we're looking for automated solutions to prevent this from happening in the future. \" with advocate sites such as consumerist picking up on the follow-up story, don't be surprised if more such examples surface.

Back in april, a woman filed a complaint against officer john worden, claiming the two had been seeing each other romantically for weeks while worden was on duty. According to wsau, the relationship had ended and the woman was thinking about filing a restraining order against worden. The police department launched an internal investigation into worden, who claimed the woman was stalking him. The investigation revealed something quite different. In addition to nearly 100 instances of on-the-job sex — which the woman claimed regularly happened inside worden's police suv — and improper use of his department phone, the investigation found worden falsified his work logs 146 times, lied to his supervisor, and didn't meet performance expectations ( the department's, not the woman's ). This behavior apparently affected his police work, as worden only made 27 arrests and gave 25 tickets in the entirety of 2015 while earning $ 63,000. Worden resigned may 3 after eight years with the department and believes he ' ll never work in law enforcement again. \" i screwed up, \" he tells the star-observer. \" it's ruined my life. \" but he says it's unfair that someone went to the media with the details of his resignation.",

            "By chris conley hudson, wis ( wsau ) a hudson police officer resigned after an investigation showed that he was having sex – a lot of it – while on duty. John worden resigned in may after an internal investigation found he had sex with his girlfriend up to 100 times while he was supposed to be on patrol. The report also found that worden used his police-issued phone for 4 to 6 hours for personal use during his 10-hour shifts and falsified his logs about his patrol activities. Police chief marty jensen confirmed that worden resigned, but didn't offer any specifics into the case. The investigation was sparked by a citizen complaint in april saying that a hudson police officer was using his position with the department to \"bait \" women. The woman who filed the complaint said she was in a romantic relationship with worden for several months and was considering seeking a restraining order once the relationship ended. Worden was placed on administrative leave when the complaint was received. He'd been an officer in hudson for eight years. ( the metrosource news wire contributed to this report. )",
            "Eight-year department veteran john worden signed a resignation agreement may 3 — about two weeks after he admitted to violating numerous policies, according to documents released last month by the hudson police department. Worden's last day was may 13. In an internal investigation summary, hudson police lt. Geoff willems concluded that worden spent an estimated four to six hours of every 10-hour shift using his department-issued phone for personal use. Worden also falsified daily work logs 146 times; exhibited conduct unbecoming an officer by having sex an estimated 98 times while on duty; failed to meet department performance expectations; and lied to a supervisor about how he spent his time at work, according to willems'summary of violations.

            "By chris conley hudson, wis ( wsau ) a hudson police officer resigned after an investigation showed that he was having sex – a lot of it – while on duty. John worden resigned in may after an internal investigation found he had sex with his girlfriend up to 100 times while he was supposed to be on patrol. The report also found that worden used his police-issued phone for 4 to 6 hours for personal use during his 10-hour shifts and falsified his logs about his patrol activities. Police chief marty jensen confirmed that worden resigned, but didn't offer any specifics into the case. The investigation was sparked by a citizen complaint in april saying that a hudson police officer was using his position with the department to \"bait \" women. The woman who filed the complaint said she was in a romantic relationship with worden for several months and was considering seeking a restraining order once the relationship ended. Worden was placed on administrative leave when the complaint was received. He'd been an officer in hudson for eight years. ( the metrosource news wire contributed to this report. )",
            "Eight-year department veteran john worden signed a resignation agreement may 3 — about two weeks after he admitted to violating numerous policies, according to documents released last month by the hudson police department. Worden's last day was may 13. In an internal investigation summary, hudson police lt. Geoff willems concluded that worden spent an estimated four to six hours of every 10-hour shift using his department-issued phone for personal use. Worden also falsified daily work logs 146 times; exhibited conduct unbecoming an officer by having sex an estimated 98 times while on duty; failed to meet department performance expectations; and lied to a supervisor about how he spent his time at work, according to willems'summary of violations. Worden, reached last week by phone, said he stands accountable for the misconduct and that he is paying the price for his mistakes. He said he no longer works in law enforcement and likely won't again. \"i screwed up, \" worden said in an interview. \"i ' m sorry, and i ' m not that person anymore — and i lost my job for it. \"it was a mistake.

She's also demanded that the family stay out of the house from 8am to 8pm.

The kilauea eruption has been a slow-motion disaster, steadily destroying homes for a month but presenting little threat to people, while the fuego eruption has been faster and fiercer, killing more than 100 thus far. Scientists say the volcanos have different underlying geology and magma viscosity. \" the magma at kilauea is quite runny, which means the gasses can easily escape, \" a volcanologist tells national geographic. \" at fuego, the magma is stickier and more viscous. \" fuego is belching what's called a \" pyroclastic flow, \" a fast-moving noxious cocktail of rock and gas with temperatures topping 1,800 degrees fahrenheit, per cnn. By contrast, kilauea's lava flow is moving so slowly that people can easily walk away from it. \" lava flows rarely kill people, \" one volcano expert tells the times, but \" you will not survive a pyroclastic flow. \" the volcanos ' proximity to population centers has also made a difference: kilauea is located in a national park, while fuego is near densely populated areas that were quickly overtaken by ash and gas moving at more than 400 mph. Both regions will be uninhabitable for years, but according to one analyst, fuego poses the additional challenge of volcanic mudflows that occur \" when the loose debris mixes with rain/river waters. \"",

Investigators will likely pore over a state-created database of controlled substances prescribed in california. Tracking celebrity prescription drug use can be complicated because they may regularly use drugs prescribed to aides, according to law enforcement authorities. \" celebrities often get their prescription drugs from doctors who are more than willing to give them what they want, and sometimes using members of their entourage, \" says one la investigator. And prosecuting doctors for writing too many prescriptions is extremely difficult. Beverly hills police revealed that wine and beer, as well as bottles of prescription drugs ativan, valium, and xanax, were found in houston's hotel room the night she was found \" underwater and unconscious \" in the bathtub. In other houston news, ex-husband bobby brown is reportedly battling to see their daughter. He rushed to la to be with bobbi kristina, but has been kept away from her by houston's mother, sources tell tmz.

But officials have said the amounts of drugs did not seem unusually large, leaving it unclear whether the medications had anything to do with the singer's death. Officials are waiting for the results of toxicology tests on houston's body.the source would not discuss specifics of the case but said it was standard practice to examine whether the drugs were dispensed properly and if there was any indication that she was receiving too many prescriptions. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is ongoing.dave campbell, a retired captain from the coroner's office, said investigators would count the tablets in each container and compare them against the date of the prescription to see if the person was taking the correct dosage. \" sometimes you find other medications inside \" the bottles, he said.defense attorney ellyn garofalo, who won acquittal for a physician charged with over-prescribing drugs to anna nicole smith, said investigators were probably going to be looking at several specific areas.they will compare the amounts of prescription medications gathered from houston's room with the amounts of medication that were dispensed. They will look at which pharmacies dispensed the drugs and which doctor or doctors prescribed them.

        "summary": "Amelia earhart buffs will likely to be tuning in to the history channel at 9pm eastern sunday for a documentary that floats a provocative theory: investigators say a newly surfaced photo shows earhart and navigator fred noonan on a dock on one of the marshall islands, suggesting that they were rescued by the japanese military after crashing and then imprisoned. A post at the daily beast, however, joins the skeptics: it notes that a japanese author tracked down a surviving member of the japanese ship that allegedly transported earhart to japan, and the telegraphist was adamant: the ship never spotted earhart, alive or dead. Meanwhile, a competing theory that earhart crash-landed on nikumaroro island is still alive after an unusual hunt involving forensic dogs. Border collies sniffing around the island as part of a search by the international group for historic aircraft recovery, or tighar, \" alerted \" near a tree on the island last week, meaning they seemed to detect human remains, reports national geographic. Archaeologists digging at the site turned up nothing, but a long-shot hope remains: investigators are sending samples of the soil to dna specialists in germany to see whether they can detect the remains of earhart or noonan. Results should be known in a matter of weeks. Daily beast writer clive irving looks into both theories and find that each is lacking. The best bet, he writes, is that earhart and noonan are somewhere on the ocean floor. As for the history channel theory, \" they most certainly didn't die in a japanese prison. \"",

        "summary": "The bombs at yesterday's boston marathon were made from pressure cookers packed with metal shards, nails, and ball bearings, then placed in duffel bags and left on the ground, a person who has been briefed on the investigation tells the ap. Nbc news has basically the same information, citing law enforcement officials; it adds that the bombs were set off using timers. The ap's source says officials don't know what was used to actually set off the explosives, which were low-grade ( their shrapnel was moving at 3,300 feet per second or slower, nbc explains ). Similar pressure-cooker bombs have been used in afghanistan, india, nepal, and pakistan, as well as in the attempted times square bombing in 2010. At a press conference today, the massachusetts general hospital trauma chief confirmed that the metal fragments pulled from victims were likely pellets or nails specifically placed in the bombs to inflict harm, the boston globe reports. \" i think it's unlikely they would be so consistent if they were pulled out from the environment, \" he explains. Some victims were hit with as many as 30 or more pieces. An emergency physician who worked on some of the victims also described seeing small ball bearings, which he said \" clearly were designed to be projectiles that were built into the device. \" the timing was also likely chosen to maximize injuries, as the marathon's four-hour mark is typically crowded with recreational runners crossing the finish line as their friends and relatives cheer nearby. ( officials earlier said there were no unexploded bombs found, contrary to early reports. )",

        "summary": "A case artnet.com calls \" one wild ride \" may finally be over after a federal judge ruled tuesday that artist peter doig wasn't the painter of a painting owned by an ex-corrections officer — and that the man and his art dealer couldn't sue doig for foiling plans to sell the painting for millions, the new york times reports. \" peter doig could not have been the author of this work, \" judge gary feinerman said, refuting plaintiffs ' claims that doig was fibbing by denying the landscape painting owned by robert fletcher was his. What made the case uncommon: doig, a living artist, was forced to deny he'd made a painting rather than prove he had. Fletcher said he had seen doig paint the piece in the mid- ' 70s while the artist was serving a short stint at the prison where fletcher worked, and that doig had later sold fletcher the painting for $ 100. But doig said he'd never been jailed and that the painting was by one peter edward doige, whose sister provided evidence that seemed to indicate he was a closer match to being the artist behind the piece. The times notes the plaintiffs used \" somewhat unorthodox efforts \" to make their case and compared doig's other works — which often sell for tens of millions of dollars — to this particular painting, claiming doig was lying because he didn't want to be publicly embarrassed at knocking off his own painting in later pieces. But the judge ruled against the plaintiffs, who had sought almost $ 8 million in damages and a certificate of authenticity for the now \" worthless \" painting — which forbes notes was valued at $ 10 million before doig disputed its origins, saying any similarities were \" purely coincidental. \" the chicago sun-times notes \" no one's happy \" with the ruling, with doig's attorney calling the case a \" flagrant example of unethical conduct in the us courts, \" fletcher still insisting the painting is a doig, and fletcher's art dealer noting, \" no one should be allowed to lie. \"",

It looks just like the free paper bags balenciaga gives patrons their purchases in, only this one is made from calfskin and costs just a touch more. Time calls it balenciaga's \" latest effort to troll the fashion world \" after it released a $ 2,145 version of one of those cheap blue ikea shopping bags in april.

Volunteers in the weminuche area spent hours searching for dustin beaver, 33, his 8-year-old son and daughter, and 6-year-old son, after they failed to return from a hike on saturday. They were reported missing sunday night by beaver's wife when she found her husband's car still parked at the cave basin trailhead, reports the durango herald. With no sign of the family by late monday — save for footprints and the smell of a campfire — the la plata county search and rescue called in several helicopters. \" they were literally less than 30 minutes from launch, \" an official tells the herald. Then came \" the best news in the world. \" with help from an arizona family, beaver and his children had reached the pine river trailhead, well outside the search area and in \" almost the opposite direction \" that the family had been heading on saturday, an official says. Beaver, who'd planned to take the kids to dollar lake, told police that he followed directions from a fellow hiker that took him in the entirely wrong direction, per kdvr. The family wandered for two days — with food, water, and a tent for shelter — before meeting up with the group that took them down the mountain. Police say they returned \" in good condition \" around 8pm complaining only of numerous bug bites. A la plata county official adds beaver's wife cried \" tears of joy \" when she heard the family was found.",

Bias, who had shown so much promise at maryland, was targeted for years by red auerbach as the next great celtics player, the one who would take the franchise past the larry bird era.

        "summary": "In a ruling that could have wide implications for job applicants who dress according to religious reasons, the supreme court ruled 8-1 today that abercrombie and fitch violated the civil rights of a muslim woman in tulsa, okla., by denying her a job because of her headscarf, reuters reports. Samantha elauf, then 17, wore her hijab to her 2008 interview at abercrombie kids, but she never mentioned it — or the fact that she was muslim — and neither did the interviewer, newsok notes. After the interview, however, she was told by a friend who worked there that she didn't get the job because of her hijab, which was apparently in violation of the company's stringent \" look policy, \" which mandates, among other things, that employees can't wear black clothing or caps that might detract from its brand, per jd supra. Although a judge initially ruled in elauf's favor, an appeals court sided with abercrombie, noting elauf never mentioned she was muslim and would need a religious exemption from company policy, jd supra notes. A civil rights attorney who spoke to al jazeera pointed out the sticky situation of a job applicant not wanting to bring up religion for fear of being discriminated against, and a potential employer avoiding the subject for fear of asking too-personal questions. But even though elauf never mentioned that she wore her hijab for religious reasons, justice antonin scalia today noted that abercrombie \" at least suspected \" she did so, and \" that is enough. \" ( abercrombie has claimed a muslim wearing a headscarf cost it sales before. )",

In her book, she also reveals that cruise stood at the altar waiting for holmes for 20 minutes, as lopez asked remini, \" do you think katie is coming? \" suri cruise was 7 months old at the time, and remini says she heard the baby crying and followed the noise to a bathroom, where she found suri lying on the floor as three women ( including cruise's sister and his assistant ) stared at her as if she were \" l.

        "summary": "The scandal over rigged libor rates, the benchmark rate used for interest rates on trillions of dollars worth of loans, is quickly growing past barclays and threatens to engulf the bank of england and a dozen other banks, including several in the us, reports the wall street journal. Barclays officials had hoped the early deal it reached with us and british regulators, admitting guilt and taking a $ 453 million fine, would spare it from the worst of the scandal's fallout. But even with the resignation of top barclays execs including ceo bob diamond in recent days, outrage is growing. Diamond was grilled by a parliamentary inquiry yesterday. \" either you were complicit, grossly negligent, or incompetent, \" a labour lawmaker told him. Ahead of the hearing, barclays apparently ratcheted up the scandal several levels, releasing a 2008 email that suggested it was encouraged by a senior bank of england official to manipulate the rate. \" we have officially disappeared down the rabbit hole of the international financial oligarchy, \" writes matt taibbi in rolling stone, calling the revelation \" mind-blowing \" because it implies that all the other banks were doing the same thing and indicates that the official was passing on the message on behalf of the british government. Diamond, however, denied that he had considered the email an order, or, as the probe chairman said, \" a nod and a wink, even though it reads that way to almost anyone who looks at it. \" analysts believe the other banks involved will have to cough up billions to settle the allegations — and predict that diamond won't be the only bank chief to be sacked.

This is important for the animals and for the entire meat-selling industry. Let's start with the sows: a gestation crate is an individual metal stall so small that the sow cannot turn around; most sows spend not only their pregnancies in crates, but most of their lives. For humans, this would qualify as \"cruel and unusual punishment, \" and even if you believe that pigs are somehow \"inferior, \""

And develop it did for mitchell, who admitted she had a sexual relationship with matt that started when he gave her an \" open-mouth kiss \" in april and progressed to her giving him oral sex; she also confessed to touching his genitals through a hole in a prison coat used to hide their activity, as well as to sending sexually provocative pics and notes to sweat via matt, though she says she didn't get sexual with sweat. Mitchell says she was supposed to meet them the night of the escape, then drive to her house so matt could kill \" the glitch \" — her husband, lyle — before the three of them took off. \" i know i had agreed to help them escape and run away with them, but i panicked and couldn't follow through with the rest of the plan, \" she says in the statement. \" i really do love my husband and he's the reason. \" ( mitchell's \" moment of clarity \" came over chinese food. )",

Ibrahim ahmed mahmoud al-qosi of sudan pleaded guilty last month to supporting terrorism, making him only the fourth guantanamo detainee to be convicted since the prison, which has held nearly 800 men, was opened in 2002. The jury of 10 u.s. Military officers was not told about the sentence limit in the plea agreement.

Department of defense official, 50-year-old al-qaida cook from sudan, ibrahim ahmed mahmoud al-qosi,, left, attends... ( associated press ) a guantanamo jury recommended a 14-year sentence wednesday for an al-qaida cook, though its decision may be overruled by a plea bargain that will limit the time he spends in prison. Ibrahim ahmed mahmoud al-qosi of sudan pleaded guilty last month to supporting terrorism, making him only the fourth guantanamo detainee to be convicted since the prison, which has held nearly 800 men, was opened in 2002. The jury of 10 u.s. Military officers was not told about the sentence limit in the plea agreement. If it is less than 14 years, the jury's sentence will only be applied if al-qosi does something to break the deal, said navy capt. David iglesias, a spokesman for military prosecutors. Military officials say al-qosi's actual sentence will not be revealed publicly until it is reviewed by a pentagon official known as the tribunals ' convening authority, a process that could take several weeks. It is not yet clear where he might be held. Judge nancy paul, an air force lieutenant colonel, said wednesday that officials would have 60 days after sentencing to determine that.

        "summary": "\" encouraging \" alzheimer's news: biogen idec's drug aducanumab has been shown to slow mental decline in patients with early or mild alzheimer's disease in a small drug trial, the full results of which were released friday. The new york times reports 166 patients were randomly given low to high doses of the drug ( meant to eliminate amyloid plaque in the brain ) or a placebo. Experts say the trial was designed to assess aducanumab's safety rather than effects, but the drug proved to be the first to both ease plaque and slow cognitive decline, forbes reports. \" it would be kind of hard to get those kind of results by chance, \" a doctor says. Another adds the drug was \" impressive \" when taken in the highest dose. Over a year, placebo patients fell 3.14 points on a 30-point cognition scale, while those taking the highest dose dropped 0.58 points. Patients on a middle dose slid 0.75 points. Researchers caution, however, that taking the drug, also known as biib037, in the highest dose led to swelling in the brain at a higher rate than with other drugs in its class. About 55 % of high-dose patients with the genetic variant apoe4 reported the side effect, compared to 17 % without the variant; the side effect hit 11 % of middle-dose patients without the variant. Some 22 % of patients also reported headaches, the wall street journal reports. Many believe amyloid plaque causes dementia, yet other drugs designed to prevent or remove the plaque have failed. To boost the chance of success, biogen used an imaging technique to ensure patients had plaque in their brains. Researchers note that other drugs that looked promising in early trials proved ineffective in larger ones; biogen is now planning a trial of 1,000 patients. Forbes reports that a positive result could push the drug to market by 2020. ( a doctor claims his simple, three-step test could predict alzheimer's, and ultrasound has also shown potential in restoring memories. )",

Chris christie, ben carson, and even msnbc's joe scarborough are among the names popping up, but one in particular seems to be on most short lists: newt gingrich. ( see the new york times, washington times, and cox media, among others. ) the former house speaker has been one of trump's most vocal backers, and he tells the new york times that \" it would be very hard for a patriotic citizen to say no. \" at the national review, myra adams weighs the pros and cons and finds that it makes sense in some fundamental ways. Essentially, gingrich would play the role of trump's \" chief strategist, \" balancing his sweeping views with wonky logistics. \" if trump is the embodiment of the populist fantasy of the outsider — with no political experience — who is thrust into power by an angry electorate with a mandate to turn washington on its head, right all the wrongs, and ' make america great again, ' gingrich could be trump's wise sidekick. \" there are some downsides, too — the pair have six marriages between them, which wouldn't seem to bode well with the women's vote — but adams thinks wife callista gingrich could play a big role in the campaign. As for trump himself, he says he has no name in mind just yet, reports abc news. \" i think probably i would like to go with somebody with great political experience. \"",

        "summary": "Want to experience lsd-like hallucinations without actually having to ingest any drugs? try staring into someone's eyes in a dimly lit room for 10 minutes. It worked for jenni avins, who sat down a colleague in a supply closet, stared into her eyes, and saw her facial contours replaced by the features of a mountain lion: \" i cried the whole time, \" avins writes at quartz. \" then we went back to work. \" for the record, her colleague had roughly the same experience ( she thought avins began to resemble a lioness ). This strange encounter was inspired by italian researcher giovanni caputo, who gathered 40 people in a room with \" low illumination \" and had half of them do the long eye-stare while the other half stared at walls while sitting back-to-back, ifl science reports. Afterward, those staring eye-to-eye said time got slower, they felt spacey, and they experienced strange hallucinations. As reported in psychiatry research, 90 % of them saw the other person's face deform, 75 % witnessed monster-like beings, and 30 % saw animals. So what's it all about? caputo says it may be \" dissociation, \" or a person's departure from reality: in this case, he says, the appearance of monsters or animals may come after returning from a dissociative state brought on by minimal sensory stimulation. Looking at an earlier caputo study — of people who stared at their reflection until strange features emerged — scientific american in 2013 put it down partly to \" troxler fading, \" the effect brought on by staring at a single point for a long time. But ifl science doesn't think that applies here: \" if this were to explain \" the latest study, it says, \" then we would expect facial features to gradually vanish, rather than having strange things appear.... We clearly still have a lot to learn about these strange phenomena. \" ( meanwhile, some people are taking lsd in an unusual way. )",

In an april court case only now being reported, the former couple were ordered to pay $ 660,000 plus $ 70,000 in reputation-related damages after allegedly stopping payments to the designer overseeing a lighting update to their 17th-century property in provence.

Soudant says she employed 17 people who worked on the project for months. But soudant adds she was nearly driven to ruin when pitt stopped paying. Lawyers claimed pitt stopped paying soudant because he believed she had demanded nearly $ 6 million. But a french appeals court determined the amount had been overstated. Soudant says pitt in an email demanded she \" finish the project and be proud of it. \" another email reportedly read, \" don't waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don't worry about the rest. \" despite the april payout, soudant says she's still fighting to get credit for the remodel, later taken over by another designer.

        "summary": "On november 25, 1965, zella jackson price gave birth to a baby girl at homer g. Phillips hospital in st. Louis, her granddaughter says. What allegedly happened in the hours after that is both confusing and dreadful: price, a gospel singer, says she was told by a nurse the baby died shortly after birth, and she went home heartbroken. But melanie diane gilmore has been alive this whole time, adopted by another family, and the mother and daughter met at price's olivette, mo., home last week for the first time, ktvi reports. Gilmore arrived in price's driveway with her own daughter and son, and the two women embraced after their five-decade separation. \" there's nothing greater than this, \" price said. \" nothing. \" but what happened to gilmore, who lost her hearing at the age of 3 from illness, is still a mystery. A post on the youtube page of melika jackson, gilmore's daughter, makes reference to someone who \" decided to perform an unlawful act which involved the kidnapping of a child. \" jackson goes on to explain that, with a name given to gilmore by her adoptive parents, gilmore's kids searched for her biological mother and confirmed it was price with dna testing. Jackson also posted a video on facebook on march 7 that shows how they broke the good news to gilmore, as well as her first emotional face-to-face with price via computer. The family says it will hire an attorney to look into what went down at the hospital, which usa today notes closed in 1979. Since the story aired on tv, a second family has come forward with a similar story from the facility. ( babies switched at birth in 1994 were awarded $ 2 million in damages. )",

When shin was just 13, he ratted out his older brother's escape plans for some extra rations and a small promotion in his school — but in fact, the only \" rewards \" shin got for the betrayal were days of torture, months of solitary confinement, and, six months later, a front-row seat to his brother's and mother's executions, writes blaine harden in the atlantic. Nine years after watching those executions, shin decided to escape camp 14. In the dead of winter, he slid through the fence, walked to the border and into china. Two years later, he made it to south korea and renamed himself shin dong-hyuk; two years after that he moved to california. In earlier stories, shin presented himself as innocent in the camp, but now he admits that growing up in the camp made him just as brutal as the rest of the guards and prisoners. \" i was more faithful to guards than to my family, \" says shin. \" there is no sense of community. I am one of those mean prisoners. \" read the full article here. Author harden also has a book about shin's horrifying experiences and desperate escape, escape from camp 14.",

        "summary": "There's a somber feeling attached to the seventh fast &amp; furious flick following paul walker's death in the middle of filming. With help from his brothers and plenty of cgi, moviemakers managed to not only finish the movie, but honor their fallen comrade in the process. Here's what critics are saying: the flick involves an \" unnecessarily complicated plot, \" but \" it doesn't all have to make sense, or even conform to the laws of gravity; it's just 134 minutes of pure adrenaline, \" elaine teng writes at the new republic.

            "\"the fast and the furious \" movies have elicited various emotions during their nearly 14 years ( so far ) of existence. Those feelings include souped-up dodge charger envy, michelle rodriguez resurrection confusion and various states of magnificent car collision awe. But this remarkably resilient vin diesel-goes-vroom-vroom franchise has rarely struck a note of genuine poignancy. That changes with \"furious 7, \" which unleashes the usual cockamamie car chases and imax-ready explosions but also earnestly marks the final performance by paul walker. The actor — who plays brian o ' conner, a.k.a. The pseudo-brother/partner-in-crime to diesel's dominic toretto — died in a 2013 car accident, an event that felt particularly tragic since he was primarily known for a street-racing film series featuring the catchphrase \"ride or die. \" [ paul walker died while filming 'furious 7. ' how did other movies handle the sudden loss of a star? ] not surprisingly, the loss of walker, who had shot a solid chunk of \"furious 7 \" before his death, hovers over much of the movie, particularly during a flashback-filled tribute to the star that gently ruptures the fourth wall between fiction and reality. On more than one occasion, longtime fans might find themselves getting misty. But more often, it's their adrenaline, not their tears, that will be flowing. \"furious 7 \" plays to the saga '",
            "It probably seems lame to call furious 7 a family film. But what the fuck, it is — the family being the audiences that have stuck with this car-porn franchise, thick and thin, since the first chapter, in 2001. And the family of actors and crew who have gathered here to pay tribute to one of their own. That would be paul walker, who plays brian o ' connor, the undercover cop who infiltrated an outlaw gang of east l.a. Street racers, run by dominic toretto ( vin diesel ), and stayed to form a bond. Walker, 40, died in a high-speed car crash on november 30th, 2013, in the passenger seat of a 2005 porsche carrera gt that hit trees and a concrete lamppost. With only half of walker's scenes finished at the time of his tragic death, it took an act of will to decide the fate of furious 7. After taking time to grieve, walker's brothers, caleb and cody, stepped up to fill in for scenes that digital grafting couldn't cover. Tough job. It had to look seamless. And it pretty much does. Furious 7 is the best f&f by far, two hours of pure pow fueled by dedication and passionate heart. This one sticks with you. The usual flaws — plot bumps,"

            "\"the fast and the furious \" movies have elicited various emotions during their nearly 14 years ( so far ) of existence. Those feelings include souped-up dodge charger envy, michelle rodriguez resurrection confusion and various states of magnificent car collision awe. But this remarkably resilient vin diesel-goes-vroom-vroom franchise has rarely struck a note of genuine poignancy. That changes with \"furious 7, \" which unleashes the usual cockamamie car chases and imax-ready explosions but also earnestly marks the final performance by paul walker. The actor — who plays brian o ' conner, a.k.a. The pseudo-brother/partner-in-crime to diesel's dominic toretto — died in a 2013 car accident, an event that felt particularly tragic since he was primarily known for a street-racing film series featuring the catchphrase \"ride or die. \" [ paul walker died while filming 'furious 7. ' how did other movies handle the sudden loss of a star? ] not surprisingly, the loss of walker, who had shot a solid chunk of \"furious 7 \" before his death, hovers over much of the movie, particularly during a flashback-filled tribute to the star that gently ruptures the fourth wall between fiction and reality. On more than one occasion, longtime fans might find themselves getting misty. But more often, it's their adrenaline, not their tears, that will be flowing. \"furious 7 \" plays to the saga '",
            "It probably seems lame to call furious 7 a family film. But what the fuck, it is — the family being the audiences that have stuck with this car-porn franchise, thick and thin, since the first chapter, in 2001. And the family of actors and crew who have gathered here to pay tribute to one of their own. That would be paul walker, who plays brian o ' connor, the undercover cop who infiltrated an outlaw gang of east l.a. Street racers, run by dominic toretto ( vin diesel ), and stayed to form a bond. Walker, 40, died in a high-speed car crash on november 30th, 2013, in the passenger seat of a 2005 porsche carrera gt that hit trees and a concrete lamppost. With only half of walker's scenes finished at the time of his tragic death, it took an act of will to decide the fate of furious 7. After taking time to grieve, walker's brothers, caleb and cody, stepped up to fill in for scenes that digital grafting couldn't cover. Tough job. It had to look seamless. And it pretty much does. Furious 7 is the best f&f by far, two hours of pure pow fueled by dedication and passionate heart. This one sticks with you. The usual flaws — plot bumps,"

He then added, in an apparent reference to his long hours at work: \" you think this is an option. It is not. \" musk was responding to an open letter from huffington on friday in which she called on him to change the way he works so he can ensure he's taking more time to \" refuel and recharge. \" musk conceded in a wide-ranging interview with the new york times last week that he's overwhelmed by job stress, has been working up to 120 hours a week, and sometimes takes ambien to get to sleep. In her open letter, which referenced musk's interview with the times, huffington urged musk to ease up on the long hours at work. \" working 120-hour weeks doesn't leverage your unique qualities, it wastes them, \" she wrote on her wellness website, thrive global. \" you can't simply power through — that's just not how our bodies and our brains work. \"",

        "summary": "Laws in 13 states making it a crime for a driver to refuse an alcohol test might soon change radically, based on how a supreme court hearing went down wednesday. Drivers from minnesota and north dakota, arrested for drunk driving after refusing a breath test, argued the test violated their constitutional protection from warrantless searches, per usa today. The justices seemed swayed. \" you're asking for an extraordinary exception here, \" justice anthony kennedy told lawyers. \" you're asking for us to make it a crime to exercise what many people think of as a constitutional right. \" the justices say current laws mean well, but they question why officers can't get a warrant for a test quickly. Many states have magistrates on call at all hours, and stats show warrants can be acquired in as little as five minutes. A government lawyer says magistrates aren't always available in remote areas. Other concerns: that delays in administering a test could allow a driver's blood alcohol level to fall, and that drivers might refuse a test even after a warrant is issued to face lesser charges for obstruction, per fox news. After 70 minutes, \" it appeared a majority of justices were lining up against the states, \" reports usa today. Some justices note the \" minor invasion \" of a breath test should perhaps be allowed without a warrant, but not blood and urine tests. A verdict is expected by late june, per nbc news. Meanwhile, the court has ruled congress did not overstep its authority in a 2012 law allowing feds to seize iranian assets, meaning us victims of terrorism can now collect $ 2 billion from iran's central bank, per bloomberg.",

Drivers prosecuted under those laws claim they violate the constitution's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures. State supreme courts in minnesota and north dakota upheld the laws. The justices pressed lawyers representing the states on why they can't simply require police to get a warrant every time police want a driver to take an alcohol test. Justice stephen breyer pointed to statistics showing that it takes an average of only five minutes to get a warrant over the phone in wyoming and 15 minutes to get one in montana.

Officials and relatives tells abc news that human remains in areas of syria liberated from the group are being tested by the fbi laboratory in quantico, va., though it may be months before the remains can be identified. Officials say the remains were located with information from the interrogation of el shafee elsheikh and alexanda amon kotey, believed to be two of the four brutal captors nicknamed \" the beatles \" because of their british accents. Fbi agents with cadaver dogs, assisted by american troops, began excavating possible grave sites in syria earlier this year after kotey and elsheikh were captured by kurdish forces. While the fbi and american military officials have been given access to the two captives, they remain in kurdish custody, and it isn't clear where they ' ll end up. In a new york times op-ed earlier this year, the families of four murdered american hostages — james foley, steven sotloff, peter kassig, and kayla mueller — called for them to be given a \" fair and public trial \" either in the hague or a us civilian court, not guantanamo bay. In an interview with the ap last week, elsheikh and kotey, who've reportedly been stripped of their british citizenship, refused to confirm whether they were part of the notorious cell that tortured and beheaded hostages. They described the us and britain as \" hypocrites \" who wouldn't give them a fair trial, but they called the execution of the isis hostages \" regrettable. \"",

Jay inslee earlier this year after forming the southern resident orca task force, an initiative meant to keep endangered killer whales alive in the region. Contributing to their extinction there, per the new york times, is the fact that they're starving to death as their main food source, chinook salmon, disappears. Komo reports that, per the latest census numbers, there are just 75 killer whales in the pacific northwest — a 30-year low. The orca population is also slowly decreasing in number there due to other factors, including fewer births ( not a single calf has been born in the area in three years ), a weakened gene pool that's partly due to companies like sea world taking dozens of orcas out of circulation, and possibly even as part of an overall \" marine ecosystem in collapse, \" per the times. Pollution is also an issue — including pesticides found in the salmon the orcas devour at a rate of 30 or so a day, when they can get them — and a new pipeline project starting in august could further expose them to more threats, such as oil spills and tanker noise. Both the toxins and the commotion can further cripple the orcas ' immune systems. There are even worries that the already weakened whales may succumb to a cross-species disease that finds its way to their pods. \" i've had dreams about it at night, \" one worried vet says. One ongoing effort to help the whales thrive again is raising more chinook salmon ( also known as king salmon ) in nearby hatcheries, but some aren't sure that's enough — and losing the whales would be devastating. \" they are such a part of our identity here, \" one biologist says. \" it would be a real sense of failure. \" ( a grim first among orcas. )",

One 15-year-old tells the guardian he takes three smoke breaks a day on his school's playground, where he's encouraged to smoke and an ashtray is provided. It sounds like a stereotypical french scene — only it wasn't always this way. In fact, it's \" one of the weirdest results \" of the november terror attacks in paris, reports vice news. Officials feared crowds of students smoking outside schools would become easy targets for terrorists, so special measures under a state of emergency were used to encourage outdoor smoking areas on school grounds. \" it's safer for us, \" says one student. But another says the move was a surprise. \" teachers have spent so long telling us smoking is bad for us and here they are giving us a special area of the school courtyard to do it in. Wow! \" she says, adding the change has probably helped some pupils smoke more often. A doctor — who notes 30 schools around paris are allowing smoking on school grounds — fears it will also encourage others to take up the habit. Some 125,000 of france's current high school students will die from smoking over the next 30 years, he says, noting, \" that's huge compared to terror attacks. \" the ministry of education says officials are \" very committed to the fight against addiction and smoking, \" adding school principals have the final say on whether to allow smoking.

        "summary": "Globe-trotting tourists are doing a lot more damage to the planet than previously thought, according to a new study that takes more than just air miles into consideration. In the study, published in the journal nature, researchers determined that tourism accounts for around 8 % of global carbon emissions, around three times more than earlier estimates, with the carbon footprint growing four times more quickly than thought between 2009 and 2013, cnn reports. The researchers, who describe tourism as \" largely a high-income affair, \" say they looked at emissions produced by the eating, shopping, and local transportation activities of tourists in 160 countries worldwide, as well as the air travel involved. The researchers, who looked at domestic as well as international travel, say tourists from the us are responsible for the most emissions, followed by those from china, germany, and india. Lead researcher dr. Arunima malik from the university of sydney tells the bbc that tourism is responsible for up to 80 % of emissions in places like the maldives and the seychelles. \" the small island states are in a difficult position because we like traveling to these locations and those small island states very much rely on tourist income but they are also at the same time vulnerable to the effects of rising seas and climate change, \" says malik, who warns that at the rate tourism is growing, it is \" crucial \" to make it sustainable.
