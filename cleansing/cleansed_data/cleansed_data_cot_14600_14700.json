Andy holt announced last week that he'd give away an ar-15 — a weapon used in mass shootings such as aurora and san bernardino — as a \" door prize \" at a campaign fundraiser and turkey shoot at his farm on june 25, where attendees are urged to bring their own rifle and ammo, reports the tennessean. After the orlando shooting, however, he's decided to give away two. \" it was a bullet that stopped the terrorist, \" says holt, the subject of a recent viral video, per the nashville post. \" i want you to arm yourselves and learn to shoot with deadly accuracy should the need arise. \" he adds, per the tennessean, that the ar-15 gets a bad rap: \" it's black and it looks real scary, \" but \" if i beat somebody to death with a hammer, that's just a hammer. But if i was to take and wrap it up in electrical tape and make it black, i guess that would make it an assault hammer. \" holt says he and a staffer received death threats from a caller in memphis who promised to visit the state capitol on tuesday, but they won't sway his decision; state troopers have been alerted. Holt adds the giveaway isn't insensitive to the families of the orlando victims since the issue is \" the heart of the person who's pulling the trigger, \" and shooter omar mateen was a \" crazed islamist \" and \" isis devotee, \" per wsmv. \" ever been to a country where muslims are the majority? if you have, you ' ll find gay men hanging in the streets, \" he writes on facebook. The tennessee democratic party chair says the fact that holt plans to give away two rifles without background checks shows he's \" a reckless and irresponsible gun owner \" who could be arming \" the next mass shooter. \"",

Authorities say stinson has admitted to killing her son, per wfts, saying that she struck the boy in the face out of frustration, causing his head to hit a wall. After a night of seizures, she reportedly told police, she took jordan to the woods and left him. Initially, stinson had told police that a man named antwan on saturday night offered her and jordan a ride. Then antwan knocked her unconscious, and when she awoke at largo central park, jordan was missing. That story, police now say, was a lie. Now community members are asking why jordan was returned to stinson, per wfla, which adds that a caseworker saw jordan the day before stinson reported him missing. An investigation is underway. \" we hope that jordan's loss will lead to a change to protect other children in the system, \" warren said.",

The mother, latisha fisher, was later arrested and charged with the tot's murder, police said. The baby was found after a worker at the 5 boro burger restaurant noticed the mom had been inside the bathroom at the eatery on sixth avenue near west 36th street for an \"unusual amount of time \" at around 2: 30 p.m., a source said. The employee opened the door to find the boy unconscious on the 35-year-old woman's lap, with foam coming out of his mouth and nose, sources said. The worker tried performing cpr on the boy until paramedics arrived. \"a baby was taken out with a mask on [ his ] face... Then the mother came out in handcuffs, \" said a witness, marcus comeau, 35. \"she didn't seem too distressed; she had her head down. \" the medical examiner will determine the cause of the death. Fisher has four prior arrests but three of them were sealed. In 2011, she assaulted someone",

If true, it would upend long-held notions about cave paintings given that they often depict hunts and animals, and have been traditionally ascribed to ancient men, reports national geographic. The new theory comes about from a relatively simple study: dean snow's team measured the fingers of stenciled hands found in caves throughout europe and concluded that three-quarters of them belonged to women. Generally speaking, women have ring and index fingers of about the same length, unlike men, and that turns out to be even more pronounced in our prehistoric ancestors, says snow. In other words, he's positive that most of these hands belong to women. \" there has been a male bias in the literature for a long time, \" he says. \" people have made a lot of unwarranted assumptions about who made these things, and why. \" if it holds up, the research could change ideas about traditional gender roles in ancient societies, observes the international business times.

Harry fisch's new book, the new naked: the ultimate sex education for grown-ups. In an excerpt published on nerve, fisch notes that his patients are typically fixed on what the normal frequency of sex should be, but that quality — and therefore duration — should be of equal concern. He trots out statistics from previous sex studies to that end: that the length of the average sex act is 7.3 minutes, but an \" astonishing \" 43 % of such acts are completed within 2 minutes. This isn't exactly breaking news. Alfred kinsey determined decades ago that the majority of men ejaculated in 2 minutes or less. ( interestingly enough, a sex therapist recently defined intercourse lasting fewer than 2 minutes as premature ejaculation to the daily mail. ) but the new republic points out that men, not women, are probably more likely to be most bothered by the figure. A 2004 study found that men reported a significantly longer ideal duration of intercourse than did women; both sexes had similar ideas about the ideal foreplay length. So what's a guy to do, other than get over it? a swedish study offers one interesting course of action: researchers had men who couldn't make it more than a minute complete 12 weeks of pelvic floor exercises; their average ejaculation time rose nearly five-fold, from 31.7 seconds to 146.2 seconds, reports upi.",

The drivers reported that the shooting happened on i-285 near i-75 in cobb county. No one was injured, espy said. \"witnesses could only provide a limited description of the suspect vehicles, \" espy said. \"they were described as two white vehicles, possibly a corvette-style vehicle and an suv. \" cobb county police spokesman sgt.

Two days after the alleged kidnapping on may 10, officials say a 63-year-old train maintenance worker vanished in south salt lake, about two miles from where flint harrison, 51, and dereck harrison, 22, were believed to be hiding out, reports the salt lake tribune. Utah transit authority worker kay porter ricks never came home from his night shift on may 12 and was found dead in wyoming on tuesday still wearing his work boots, reports the ap. His body — which had been there for days, per kstu — was found off a dirt road about 120 miles from where the harrisons camped after fleeing utah, police say. His death has been ruled a homicide. Police say there is no \" hard evidence \" linking the harrisons to ricks'death, but \" there are some coincidences there that would be impossible to ignore as we continue to investigate. \" though ricks ' cellphone was found on a train platform in utah, police say his white ford pickup truck was spotted by surveillance cameras in wyoming, which might explain how the harrisons traveled out of state. The truck has not been found, though officials plan to search two lakes with sonar equipment. A rep for ricks ' family says that \" though kay's body may be dead, they know he lives and that they will see him again, \" per fox 13. Both harrisons are being held in pinedale, wyo., where their bail is set at $ 750,000 cash each.",

The standard examiner reports as many as 20 homes were allegedly hit ( ksl notes 11 victims are identified in court documents ), with the group unloading up to 15 dozen ( that's 180 ) eggs. Among the reported damage: broken screens, messed-up furniture, $ 2,343 in exterior stucco damage, and, somehow, $ 3,000 in damage to a victim's car ignition. A probable-cause affidavit says terry admitted to driving the juveniles around ogden, south ogden, riverdale, and washington terrace in her 1989 red ford bronco \" because of certain familial problems she was having and because she simply did not care. \" all but one of the minors has reportedly copped to being involved in the egging. It's unclear whether they ' ll face charges, too.

Those are some of the reports. \" \"the nato strikes killed 10,000 to 30,000 people? \" an incredulous wallace asked. \"a report that came out last night from the tripoli ambassador said that potentially there could be 10,000 to 30,000, \" bachmann insisted. \"you mean the libyans? \" wallace pressed. \"yes, \" bachmann replied. \"you think muammar gaddafi is a reliable person? \" wallace wondered. \"i don't think anyone thinks that. President obama, his doctrine was to enter in libya for humanitarian purposes. The point of what i ' m saying is that we are see many, many lives lost. Including innocent civilians ' lives. What will be the ultimate objective and gain? i don't see it. I think it was a foolish decision to have gotten involved, \" bachmann said. In fact, the tea party-backed lawmaker seemed to be referring to a statement made by u.s. Ambassador to libya gene cretz last week. Cretz had said that u.s. Officials believed that 10,000 to 30,000 had been killed by fighting between gaddafi forces and the rebels, not nato airstrikes. To his credit, wallace corrected bachmann in a later segment. \"i just want to clear up, because we looked into what michele bachmann had been saying. She quoted the u.s. Ambassador to libya saying 30,000 people had been killed in the nato strike so far. In fact, what ambassador gene cretz said is that he estimated that 30,000 people had been"

The smuggling vessel mary celestia traveled between the island and north carolina, avoiding a naval blockade imposed by president lincoln, ctv news reports. Divers have long visited the wreck, and after hurricanes caused it to shift about 15 years ago, they found the perfume bottle. And apparently, it didn't smell half bad. \" when the fragrance has been sitting at the bottom of the ocean and aging for so many years, you expect something that is oxidized or damaged. But my first impression was ' wow ', \" says a perfumer who recreated the scent — which is a blend of citrus, rosewood, and various flowers, ctv news notes. At xojane, colleen williams describes it as \" like dry fruity pebbles and generic fabric softener — clean with just a touch of masculinity. \" the stuff will sell for $ 225 a bottle, and only 1,864 bottles will be made, matching the year of the sinking.

Root vegetables were a mainstay, mimicking what people were eating in europe. The results were, as you might expect, disastrous. Men began by struggling to concentrate; then, fights broke out. Some men experienced serious depression, with several sent to the hospital — including one who'd cut off three of his fingers with a hatchet, reports io9. Eventually, subjects reported being too weak to open heavy doors, as they grew emaciated, their hair fell out, and their heart rates dropped. After a three-month recovery period, hardly anyone felt they'd recuperated, and some subjects continued obsessive eating for a year, io9 notes. But sutton says that he, like others, is glad he did it; it was a sacrifice as his friends were fighting, he tells the bbc. The study is still cited today in regard to eating disorders such as anorexia.

The january phone call between trump and prime minister malcolm turnbull was widely reported at the time. But the transcripts published friday by the washington post offered new details into the conversation, which focused on an obama-era refugee deal under which the united states will take up to 1,250 refugees that australia houses in detention camps on the pacific island nations of nauru and papua new guinea. According to the transcript, trump told turnbull the agreement was \" stupid, \" \" disgusting \" and \" horrible, \" adding: \" this deal will make me look terrible... I am going to get killed on this thing. \" \" it was a courteous, frank conversation as president trump said, \" turnbull told reporters in the west australian town of broome when asked about the transcripts. \" we're both adults.... I stand up for australia's interests, he stands up for america",

Sarah palin had been the first to come forward saying she had been duped by cohen, but the resulting interview has not seen the light of day.

        "summary": "Paul walker died in a porsche carrera gt, a car that a former manager at the car company has called \" crazy \" and \" the most dangerous car on the road, \" jalopnik reports. And that's not the only eerie quote the site rounded up: a well-known porsche test driver said the car was the first to actually scare him, and a top gear presenter noted, \" you need to be awake to drive this car fast. \" it's been involved in a number of other headline-making incidents, including a fatal crash at the california speedway. More on the car and walker's crash: the car is so sensitive to road conditions, porsche sent a memo to dealers before it went on sale in 2004 warning that the carrera gt is \" as close to a racecar as we will ever get, \" and thus \" has all the disadvantages of a racecar \" — so dealers shouldn't let just anybody drive it. The memo specifically notes that the car can't even drive over a foster's beer can on its side without being damaged, and tmz notes that the road where the crash occurred is covered in reflective dots. Meanwhile, some fans aren't exactly mourning walker safely: police have been sent to the crash site so they can ask fans to stop burning rubber, spinning their tires, and doing something called a \" drifting maneuver \" that involves purposely losing traction in the back tires so they slide all over the place, fox news reports. The neighborhood where walker died is a popular place for street racing, but authorities are now saying that though speed was likely a factor in the crash, eyewitnesses say rodas and walker were \" traveling alone \" at the time, fox adds. A curve may also be a factor: a source tells nbc news the car was only traveling around 45mph when it crashed, but it was at a curve where the speed limit drops to 15mph. One thing is clear: the sports car community considered walker one of its own, the los angeles times reports, and he liked to go fast: in a three-year period, he'd gotten five speeding tickets, radar reports.",

        "summary": "We sure hope this year's college grads are excited to enter the workforce because they ' ll be in it for a long time, according to a new study from nerdwallet. Researchers there say graduates of the class of 2015 will likely be working until at least 75 — a full 13 years past today's average retirement age of 62. Considering that the life expectancy for a 23-year-old is 84, that means most will have less than a decade to enjoy their golden years, per reuters. Here's why: for one thing, it's really hard to save when you're trying to pay off a hefty student loan. The study finds the average student owes $ 35,000 at graduation, reports consumerist. Perhaps that seems manageable. But when you extrapolate the debt payments over 50 years, it equals $ 680,000 in lost retirement savings. Then there's the two-pronged issue of renting. Not only do rent payments take away from savings, but rent prices are spiking, up 11 % nationally since 2012. And because grads are already in debt, they're likely to rent longer, which means less time spent building equity as a homeowner. Here's another problem: the class of 2015 is hesitant to invest. \" they lived through a very turbulent financial period when they saw their parents ' finances hurt, \" says an investing manager. Aggressive investing may help slash your retirement age, but there are other options. Want to throw in the towel at 62? a 23-year-old who starts saving 20 % of a $ 50,000 salary can make it happen. Saving 15 % will push the age to 65, while saving 10 % will raise it to 70. Don't make $ 50,000? cut back on expenses by living with your parents. Three years ' worth of saved rent could cut five years off your career. ( millennials aren't the only ones who should be worried about retirement. )",

They're only flying around a lab for now, but researchers hope the insects will eventually help stop the spread of the disease among humans. Scientists at the university of california used the crispr gene-editing tool to change the dna of a mosquito found in india, which is known to carry malaria. First, they added a set of genes that deliver antibodies to the malaria parasite that mosquitoes carry, making the bugs resistant to the disease, reports the new york times. Next, they used a \" gene drive \" to copy the genes onto both chromosomes of offspring, per the washington post. Finally, they added a gene that would give red eyes to affected mosquitoes so scientists could identify them. The scientists then inserted the genes into 680 wild mosquito larvae. About half grew to adults and were mated with wild mosquitoes. Scientists soon found 99.5 % offspring inherited the resistance across three generations, per a release and the bbc. Though scientists have yet to try the same approach in other mosquito species, they expect similar results and say the genes could spread through an entire wild population in 10 generations, or one season. However, natural selection may force other genes to overpower the modified ones, for example, or mutations may block their inheritance to offspring. \" this is the kind of technology where the first trial has to be a success, \" a study author says. A researcher says he already plans to use the findings to seek approval for a large trial in an enclosure in zambia. ( meantime, save yourself with victoria's secret perfume. )",

About half grew to adults, which were mated with wild mosquitoes, and the progeny were then screened to see if the injected plasmids had successfully found their way to the eggs or sperm of the original larvae. To help track the progress of the experiment, dr. Gantz engineered a color marker into the plasmid's cargo, a gene that turned the mosquitoes ' eyes red. Thus the appearance of red-eyed mosquitoes would mean the drive and its cargo had successfully been inherited. Olga tatarenkova, a member of dr.

            "It took dr. Gantz about two months to load all the necessary genetic elements onto a plasmid, a viruslike circle of dna that genetic engineers use to insert genes into chromosomes. Some 680 wild mosquito larvae were injected with the cargo-carrying plasmid. About half grew to adults, which were mated with wild mosquitoes, and the progeny were then screened to see if the injected plasmids had successfully found their way to the eggs or sperm of the original larvae. To help track the progress of the experiment, dr. Gantz engineered a color marker into the plasmid's cargo, a gene that turned the mosquitoes ' eyes red. Thus the appearance of red-eyed mosquitoes would mean the drive and its cargo had successfully been inherited. Olga tatarenkova, a member of dr. James's team, picked up the task of screening 25,000 mosquito larvae. One saturday morning in july, she found two",

The disease is one of earth's oldest and deadliest. It may have infected the dinosaurs. It's been found in the mummified remains of ancient egyptians. It's thought to have killed genghis khan. One nobel prize-winning scientist even went so far as to suggest that malaria may be responsible for half of all human deaths, ever. And despite our fiercest efforts at treatment and eradication — bed nets, quinine pills, pesticides, vaccines — the illness persists in killing us, to the tune of roughly half a million deaths per year.

A female twitter employee allegedly posted a photo of the party to twitter, and that image was picked up by global tech women, which tweeted it with the following caption: \" silicon valley us: @twitter is having a #frat party for employees. #lovewhereyouwork #diversitymatters #brogrammers. \" the image shows a keg, pizza boxes, a beer pong set-up, a case of pabst blue ribbon, and a sign reading \" twitter frat house \" in greek-style letters. The tech giant was in march hit by a suit from former software engineer tina huang, who claims that twitter's promotion process is secretive and discriminatory toward women, reports the new york times. Cnet adds that the huang alleges she was one of at least 50 women affected, and the suit seeks class-action status.

The wall street journal reports european commission president jean-claude juncker went to tsipras last night to discuss an 11th-hour deal that would see a financing plan and budget cuts for greece — so long as tsipras essentially told greeks oxi to oxi: to vote \" yes \" in sunday's referendum. The journal reports an about-face may have happened overnight, with an official yesterday maintaining tsipras was still gunning for a \" no \" in the referendum; another official, however, this morning said \" there is some movement. \" this reportedly follows calls tsipras had today with juncker, as well as european central bank chief mario draghi and european parliament president martin schulz. As for those leaning toward voting \" oxi \" on sunday, the new york times has some fascinating backstory on the word, which it reports has \" historical symbolism that makes it even more appealing in the present context. As every greek schoolchild knows, the annual oxi day commemorates the answer, in spirit if not verbatim, delivered by prime minister ioannis metaxas to a demand from mussolini to allow italian forces to occupy strategic parts of greece at the beginning of world war ii. \"",

The molten lava from the kilauea volcano is moving at about 30 to 45 feet per hour, the ap reports. During the day yesterday, it traveled some 500 feet, khon reports. As of this morning, the closest home is only a few hundred yards away, the ap reports, but khon notes that the flow's movement has been tough to predict; a report from last night local time said it was moving considerably faster. The problem has been a long time coming: kilauea has been erupting since 1983; the flow in question has been threatening the town of pahoa for weeks. On the way toward the pahoa area, lava has traveled through a cemetery, covering many graves but leaving at least one visible over the flow, says civil defense official darryl oliveira. Some 50 to 60 local structures are likely to be hit by the lava, the official says, and colleagues have been going door to door with evacuation instructions. The red cross is setting up a shelter, but oliveira says most people have other places they can stay.

The creatures ' milk has less cholesterol than cow's milk, and it's got more protein, vitamin c, and iron, per scientific studies, the citizen-times reports. And \" the milk is tasty, \" says king, who describes the dromedaries ' milk as the saltier and creamier of the two. What's more, the milk is also expensive, potentially at least $ 18 a pint. It's often raw as well; king says he's still testing pasteurization methods. King's camels are just a handful of the estimated 5,000 now in the us, with camel-milking outfits established in seven states ( including pennsylvania, michigan, and ohio ) and on deck in seven more.

The most recent incident occurred last month in west michigan, when a 31-year-old woman and a six-year-old girl from different counties fell ill after drinking raw milk from a farm called green pastures. The centers for disease control have released updated information on the link between raw milk and outbreaks of e. Coli infections, warning that a record number of such outbreaks were reported between 2010 and 2012. We have a fraught relationship with raw milk in the us, but elsewhere the routine consumption of raw milk is far more normalized. Raw milk vending machines, for example, have recently been installed all over europe, allowing unpasteurized dairy fiends to get a fix on the regular. The middle east is long accustomed to drinking raw milk, and we're not talking about cows or goats here. There, the milk of the humble dromedary — the camel — is so prized that camel owners often forego drinking the milk themselves, saving it for special occasions or when guests drop by. The bedouins believe it to have curative powers, and anecdotal evidence seems to support such assertions: some parents of autistic children claim the milk improves sociability and mood in their kids.

        "summary": "Scientists — presumably so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think whether they should — have grown chickens with dinosaur legs, phys.org reports. More accurately, a team at the university of chile grew chicken embryos with dinosaur-like fibulas. In modern birds, the fibula is shorter than the tibia and is \" splinter-like, \" according to the study published earlier this month in evolution. Discover magazine reports that by suppressing the indian hedgehog homolog gene — which all animals, including humans, have — scientists spurred an ankle bone in chicken embryos to produce a bone-growing protein. This resulted in a fibula that kept growing until it was longer and more tube-like, similar to the legs of theropods — the dinosaur ancestors of modern birds. Birds evolved from theropods more than 145 million years ago, and scientists believe their leg bones changed as their bodies got lighter. But, as discover puts it, \" with one small modification, millions of years of evolution can be undone, \" showing \" echoes of the dinosaurs remain in the dna of birds today. \" in addition to showing the genetic link between dinosaurs and birds, scientists are hoping to explain the genetic changes that occur during evolution. Last year, the same team grew chicken embryos with dinosaur-like feet. And us scientists were able to do the same for dinosaur-like snouts.

The research — published last week in the journal evolution — shows that \" by inhibiting early maturation of a leg of the chicken embryo, the leg reverts to the shape that dinosaurs ' legs had, \" said alexander vargas, one of the six researchers at the university of chile. \" the result is a chicken embryo with dinosaur legs, \" vargas told afp on tuesday, explaining what amounts to reverse evolution. Theropods, a group of dinosaurs, started as carnivores but evolved to eat plants and insects. Birds evolved from small theropods in the jurassic period more than 145 million years ago. In their study, scientists manipulated the indian hedgehog homolog gene common to all animals, including man. They were trying to pinpoint when birds had a dinosaur-like fibula bone. When the researchers delayed early development, the bone took on the tubular shape it once had in dinosaurs. The research should help shed new light not just on the links between birds and dinosaurs, but on the genetic changes involved in the evolution, vargas said. It also confirmed the hypothesis that a bone can be made to regrow with characteristics from the evolutionary past by interfering with early maturation, according to the study led by brazilian joao botelho at the university of chile.

The research — published last week in the journal evolution — shows that \" by inhibiting early maturation of a leg of the chicken embryo, the leg reverts to the shape that dinosaurs ' legs had, \" said alexander vargas, one of the six researchers at the university of chile. \" the result is a chicken embryo with dinosaur legs, \" vargas told afp on tuesday, explaining what amounts to reverse evolution. Theropods, a group of dinosaurs, started as carnivores but evolved to eat plants and insects. Birds evolved from small theropods in the jurassic period more than 145 million years ago. In their study, scientists manipulated the indian hedgehog homolog gene common to all animals, including man. They were trying to pinpoint when birds had a dinosaur-like fibula bone. When the researchers delayed early development, the bone took on the tubular shape it once had in dinosaurs. The research should help shed new light not just on the links between birds and dinosaurs, but on the genetic changes involved in the evolution, vargas said. It also confirmed the hypothesis that a bone can be made to regrow with characteristics from the evolutionary past by interfering with early maturation, according to the study led by brazilian joao botelho at the university of chile.

            "Associated press supporters of president hosni mubarak, bottom, clash wednesday with opponents, top, in cairo's tahrir square, the scene of recent protests that shook the egyptian regime. Violence erupted in egypt's capital when supporters of president hosni mubarak clashed for the first time with protesters, as the regime dug in against demands, from within the country and from washington, that a transfer of power begin immediately. The clashes began hours after mr. Mubarak announced in a speech late tuesday that he wouldn't run in elections slated for later this year. They gained intensity during the day in central cairo's tahrir square, with the two sides rushing at each other, wielding clubs and throwing molotov cocktails. Some mubarak supporters charged protesters on horseback and camelback, a tactic the regime has employed against past demonstrations. Clutches of soldiers looked on, doing little to intervene. The obama administration, watching the violence, began pushing harder for mr. Mubarak to quickly step aside and make way for a transitional government, people familiar with the matter said. The u.s. Began to chart a course of reforms and, for the first time since large-scale protests erupted in egypt more than a week ago, made it clear that washington and cairo — close allies for three decades — are now on different tracks. An interim government, made up of opposition parties and elements of the current regime, could buy time to rewrite the egyptian constitution, allow opposition parties to organize, and lay the groundwork for elections later this year, say supporters of the idea. Washington's stance pitted the u.s. Against mr. Mubarak, who has indicated he would stick around"

But that's not good news for the former va medical center nurse accused of downing four or five beers at a local casino and then assisting in an emergency appendectomy. On friday, federal prosecutors took up the case and charged pieri, 59, with reckless endangerment, as the alleged incident took place in a federal facility, the times leader reports. Pieri claims he forgot he was on call feb. 4 as he swilled beer and played slots, the washington post reports. An affidavit has him admitting that he knew he shouldn't have been involved with the surgery, but didn't want someone else to get called in to cover for him. So he allegedly drove drunk to the hospital and staggered inside. \" rick, are you drunk or something? \" a co-worker asked as pieri grew frustrated while trying to use the computer. A physician's assistant says he smelled alcohol on someone in the operating room. Now pieri faces up to two years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine for putting a patient \" in danger of death or serious bodily harm, \" the times-tribune reports. Pieri's estranged wife alleged in a restraining-order application last year that he abuses alcohol and that he has been abusive while drinking. In 1985, according to the times leader, pieri was charged with killing a man in a hit-and-run accident. More on the alleged incident here.",

So when cops spotted them pushing a baby carriage thursday in the mexico city suburb of ecatepec, they were hopeful they'd find the infant inside. Instead, they made a grisly find: the baby carriage was filled with body parts, the bbc reports. The couple, referred to as \" juan carlos n \" and \" patricia n, \" have been arrested, and they're now suspected of being linked to the murders of at least 10 women, though juan carlos told a court over the weekend he'd actually killed 20 women, per the independent. He also says he turned his victims ' flesh into pet food, and their bones into fertilizer, el universal newspaper reports. Prosecutors say juan carlos also confessed to sexually assaulting some of the victims before they were killed. Investigators searched two properties, including the couple's apartment, and found even more body parts stored in a refrigerator and in pails filled with cement. Prosecutors say the couple had been selling body parts from their victims — including 28-year-old nancy huitron, who vanished in early september with her infant daughter, valentina — and neighbors say whenever they saw the pair, they were pushing the baby carriage. Investigators say at least three of the victims, including huitron, apparently knew the couple, and that patricia had lured them onto their property by saying she had food and clothing for sale. In the only bright spot, the couple confessed they'd sold valentina for about $ 800, and the cops were able to find the baby and return her to her grandmother. The bbc notes that mexico state, where ecatepec is located, accounts for the highest number of disappeared women in the country.",

Trump knew nothing about the agreement with my client, the $ 130k payment, etc. \" he wrote. \" as i predicted, that has now been shown to be completely false. \" on the fox morning program, trump also distanced himself from cohen's legal trouble. \" this doesn't have to do with me, \" he said. \" michael is a businessman.

            "- a report from the department of veterans affairs administrative investigation board shows staff members at the bay pines va hospital left the body of a deceased veteran in a shower room for over nine hours, and then falsely documented the post mortem care for the body. A 24-page report detailing the events is largely redacted to conceal the identities of the deceased veteran and staff members involved, but concludes hospice staff \"failed to provide appropriate post mortem care.\" the report says hospice staff put the veteran's body in the hallway of the hospice unit, leaving it there for an unspecified amount of time. Staff then put the veteran's body in the shower room and did not \"check on the status of the decedent … for over nine hours. \" the report also says someone working in the hospice unit \"falsely documented post mortem care for the decedent. \" it was unclear if the false documentation was determined to be intentional. The report says hospice staff acknowledged that there was an increased risk of decomposition of the veteran's body while it was left in the shower room. The report also details procedures hospice staff is supposed to follow to avoid something like this from happening. In addition to findings related to this incident, the review board added that documentation such as patient charts and bed assignment charts were \"difficult to follow \" and allowed for",

The 7-year-old french bulldog was taking his first flight holed up in cargo, and the pilot recognized the dangerous situation the canine could be in. \" if you look at the outside temperature, if it's minus 50 or 60, there is some insulation, but it will probably still get down to below freezing [ in the cargo area ], \" aviation expert phyl durby tells citynews.

An air canada spokesman emailed cnn that \" while we recognize this was an inconvenience for our customers, the overall reaction was positive, particularly once people understood the dog was in potential danger but safe as a result of the diversion. \" and simba's owner, german kontorovich, had an especially positive response, telling citynews once he and simba were reunited in toronto that \" it's my dog, it's like my child.

        "summary": "The unraveling of mark halperin's once-soaring media career continues: nbc news and msnbc have fired him in the wake of multiple allegations of sexual harassment lodged by women who once worked with him. Halperin had been a political analyst for nbc and a frequent guest on msnbc's morning joe program, notes cnn. The allegations are from five women who worked with halperin when he was at abc news. He has apologized for his treatment of the women but denied the more salacious claims, including that he pressed his genitals against women and masturbated in front of them. He denies any nonconsensual sexual contact. The termination of his nbc contract is just the latest hit to halperin's career. Hbo canceled an adaptation of an upcoming book about the 2016 race, reports the new york times, and publisher penguin press then canceled the book itself, which had been due in the spring. The book had been highly anticipated, given that halperin's account of the 2008 race, game change, had been a best-seller and helped secure halperin's reputation as a political analyst.",

Evan leedy, 19, started a gofundme crowdfunding campaign for robertson which has now raised more than $ 185,000 ( and counting ). The two men met at a bar last night, where they were interviewed. \" i ' m always going to be in your debt; i will never forget this, \" robertson said.

Since not everyone is having problems, some suspect there's a problem with just one or a few of the batches. A source tells ars technica that rosa labs is spending tens of thousands of dollars to investigate the problem, and that the company's main theory at the moment is that some customers might have a sensitivity or intolerance to one of the ingredients. Buzzfeed reports that, based on the fda's online database, the facility that makes the bars hasn't had a foodborne biological hazards inspection since two years prior to the bar's launch. Soylent, however, says it was inspected by the fda this year.

        "summary": "For those who say donald trump flip-flops on the issues, a \" remarkably prophetic \" interview he gave to playboy in 1990 will prove either reassuring or frightening. The new york times sifted through some of the 26-year-old quotes and compared them to things the gop front-runner has said in 2016. In his 1990 chat with columnist glenn plaskin, trump pontificated on \" a grievance-filled economic agenda, a searing denunciation of weak-kneed american leadership, and a keen understanding of his appeal to blue-collar americans, \" as the times puts it — which doesn't sound too unlike the trump we're seeing now. Here's to consistency ( and here are some notable quotes from the long-ago interview ): \" props for the show. … the show is trump, and it's sold-out performances everywhere. I've had fun doing it and will continue to have fun, and i think most people enjoy it. \" \" we americans are laughed at around the world for losing a hundred and fifty billion dollars year after year. … our ' allies ' are making billions screwing us. \" \" some of our presidents have been incredible jerk-offs. We need to be tough. \" \" when somebody tries to sucker-punch me, when they're after my ass, i push back a hell of a lot harder than i was pushed in the first place. \" \" i don't want to be president. I ' m 100 % sure. I'd change my mind only if i saw this country continue to go down the tubes. \" ( check out the original playboy interview for more prescience. )",

            "A curious dynamic has seized the world in the past week concerning the latest iteration of north korea's ongoing game of blackmail by brinkmanship. The north, a failed state by any definition, regularly trots out ridiculous threats against everyone around it – threats which would surely result in its own rapid destruction if they were carried out ( though many lives would be lost on all sides, to be sure ). It relies on a carefully cultivated sense that it is not quite rational. The international community rushes in to provide incentives to persuade pyongyang to back down, which it pockets and then ratchets up the pressure again after a while to extract more. The latest round of all this is regarded as particularly important in that a new leader is trying his hand at the game, after we had hoped he might be different from his father and grandfather before him. He has gone somewhat further than his predecessors in terms of threats and bluster and it is not clear if he has left himself an off-ramp. The world's media have rushed to the scene to cover the \"crisis. \" reports have now surfaced that at least one arm of america's sprawling intelligence empire believes that the north may have miniaturized a nuclear warhead to fit on a missile – though the reliability of such a weapon would be doubtful and america"
