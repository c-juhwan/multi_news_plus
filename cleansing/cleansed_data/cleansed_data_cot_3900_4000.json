        "summary": "For hundreds of years, violins by antonio stradivari have been considered the best in the world, some fetching millions of dollars. The only other instruments vying for the title were crafted by a man named giuseppe guarneri, who toiled away in his workshop in the same northern italian city of cremona at the same time. Many theories have been spun over the years to explain why the instruments crafted by these masters produce a sound that cannot be replicated. A new study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences suggests it all comes down to the wood, a good bath, and a lot of time. When taiwanese researchers analyzed bits of maple from four violins and cellos by stradivarius and one violin by guarneri, they discovered a lost art. The instrument-makers, or luthiers, used wood soaked in a mineral bath to prevent rot that effectively changed it. \" this type of chemical seasoning was an unusual practice … unknown to later generations of violin makers, \" they write, per the washington post. It's likely, however, that the wood was soaked by those who first culled it from the forest, not the luthiers, to protect it before sale, notes the new york times. The upshot is that the maple used in these violins of old has different chemical properties from the maple in modern instruments. Add three centuries of aging and the effect of high-frequency vibrations from all that playing and you have, perhaps, the recipe for a masterpiece. Skeptics aren't convinced. Two british scientists writing in the conversation cited a \" halo effect \" around the italian masters, taking note of a 2011 study of 21 experts who preferred playing a modern instrument.

Lewis, of north charleston, was issued the $ 525 citation on wednesday after he ignored signage indicating that there's no such thing as a free lunch — or complimentary drink refills — at the ralph h. Johnson va medical center in charleston. Lewis, who is not a federal employee, told responding officers he had done the same thing \"multiple times \" before and never had any problems, hospital spokeswoman tonya lobbestael told foxnews.com. \"shoplifting is against the law and the signage is very clearly posted on the drink machine, \" lobbestael said. \"the same citation could be issued to anyone who is shoplifting. \" but lobbestael said thursday afternoon that the medical center had decided \" a warning in lieu of a citation is sufficient in this case. \" authorities said earlier thursday that lewis, a construction worker who was employed near the medical center, also had been banned from his work site. It was not immediately clear whether that penalty remained in effect. \"shoplifting is against the law and the signage is very clearly posted on the drink machine. The same citation could be issued to anyone"

The case against ivins has long been criticized ( glenn greenwald gives a nice history of it here ), but the fbi always said it had genetic evidence linking the spores in ivins ' lab with those found in the anthrax envelopes, and said an nrc scientific review would vindicate it. But yesterday's report concluded that the evidence \"did not definitively demonstrate \" a link between the two spore samples, though it does \"support an association. \" it also blasted the fbi for not using all the scientific techniques available to check its case, the new york times reports. Critics latched onto the report. \"there are no more excuses for avoiding an independent review, \" sen. Charles grassley tells the washington post.

In late july, 2008, the fbi announced that, this time, it had identified the real perpetrator: army researcher bruce ivins, who had just committed suicide as a result of being subjected to an intense fbi investigation.

Politico quotes two sources saying that sessions is considering a run against incumbent democrat doug jones in 2020, and cnn's jake tapper similarly reports that sessions is \" taking a serious look \" at the race. Sessions held the seat for two decades before leaving to lead trump's justice department, and his entry into the race would seemingly give republicans a decent chance of flipping the seat back to the party. Jones is seen as particularly vulnerable in the red state. The man temporarily appointed to fill sessions'seat until jones was sworn in, luther strange, is all for it. \"jeff sessions for senate in 2020! \" he tweeted. Politico, however, points out that sessions isn't a cinch to win the gop nomination should he choose to run, given president trump's relentless attacks on him. At hot air, ed morrissey adds this: \" having him back in the senate might turn into a headache for president trump at some point, but first trump has to win re-election, and it might not be bad for trump to reconcile with sessions ahead of that campaign to heal a few wounds. \" ( after the special election to fill sessions'seat, trump issued an i-told-you-so tweet. )",

Sessions was fired as attorney general wednesday, less than 24 hours after republicans lost control of the house of representatives in the midterm elections. President donald trump had publicly savaged sessions throughout his tenure, and his dismissal had long been expected. Story continued below after sessions left the senate in 2017, his vacated seat was won by democrat doug jones in a special election upset. Jones is up for a full term in 2020, and he is widely viewed as the most vulnerable incumbent senator facing reelection given alabama's conservative tilt. Republicans are certain to contest the seat aggressively as they look to protect their majority. Former republican sen. Luther strange, who was temporarily appointed to sessions ' former seat, took to twitter on wednesday evening to encourage a comeback bid",
            "It didn't take long after election night for donald trump to do what he'd clearly been itching to do for more than a year — fire jeff sessions. And it didn't take long after that for jeff sessions to start talking about a return to the status quo ante, either: former attorney general jeff sessions is considering running for his old alabama senate seat in 2020, according to two people familiar with his thinking. I wrote about this yesterday morning before the announcement of sessions ' \"resignation \" later in the day.

            "Jeff sessions, who spent two decades in the senate, is practically a household name in alabama. &#124; andrew caballero-reynolds/afp/getty images elections sessions might run for old senate seat in alabama former attorney general jeff sessions is considering running for his old alabama senate seat in 2020, according to two people familiar with his thinking. Sessions was fired as attorney general wednesday, less than 24 hours after republicans lost control of the house of representatives in the midterm elections. President donald trump had publicly savaged sessions throughout his tenure, and his dismissal had long been expected. Story continued below after sessions left the senate in 2017, his vacated seat was won by democrat doug jones in a special election upset. Jones is up for a full term in 2020, and he is widely viewed as the most vulnerable incumbent senator facing reelection given alabama's conservative tilt. Republicans are certain to contest the seat aggressively as they look to protect their majority. Former republican sen. Luther strange, who was temporarily appointed to sessions ' former seat, took to twitter on wednesday evening to encourage a comeback bid",

        "summary": "As a critical week in his presidency opens, president obama is facing a big struggle not just for support on syria but for the nation's attention, politico finds. He ' ll make his case with interviews on six tv news shows today, where he ' ll be competing with the opening night of monday night football, and with an address to the nation tomorrow, when the competition includes primary elections in new york city and the new iphone launch. Officials say that obama, who dined with a dozen gop senators at joe biden's residence last night, will use tomorrow's prime-time address to argue that not punishing bashar al-assad for the use of chemical weapons would embolden both the syrian and the iranian regimes. In other developments: obama faces a mammoth task to win over congress, according to a usa today poll that finds just 44 lawmakers out of 533 — 22 senators and 22 house members — willing to say they will support strikes on syria. That includes 28 democrats and 16 republicans. Some 19 senators and 130 house members say they will oppose an attack and the remainder are undecided. A washington post poll finds different numbers but the same trend: in the senate, 23 in favor, 17 opposed, 10 leaning no, and 50 undecided; and the house, 25 in favor, 111 against, 116 leaning no, and 181 undecided. As obama seeks support at home, john kerry is making the rounds overseas. After a long meeting with nine arab foreign ministers, the kerry announced that saudi arabia would support a strike on syria and more arab countries will soon offer their support, the boston globe reports. He rejected bashar al-assad's claim that he hadn't used chemical weapons, saying \" the evidence speaks for itself. \" kerry also met with britain's foreign secretary, who said the us and uk are \" closely aligned \" on syria despite parliament's rejection of the use of force. Kerry told reporters the \" special relationship \" was intact and the us and uk will remain \" close friends \" even if the brits sit this one out, the bbc reports. Tomorrow night's speech looks like it could be make-or-break for the president and he may make it from an unusual location: the oval office. He has only addressed the nation from his office twice, for 2010 speeches about iraq and the bp oil spill. \" i doubt the white house really believes in this moment that an oval office or white house address will be transformative, but they need to use everything in their arsenal, including sheer repetition, \" one of bill clinton",

Using only first names, the man named terry tells huffpost the story of how he gave his girlfriend anna a necklace on their one-year dating anniversary. Using huon pine, a wood native to tasmania, he carved the necklace himself, and she wore it almost every day for the next year. What she didn't know was that inside the necklace he'd hidden an engagement ring. \" it was literally under her nose, \" writes the independent. Flash forward to november 2016. They took a trip to smoo cave in scotland, a place they'd talked about visiting since they first met. On location, terry asked for the necklace so he could take a photo of it. Secretly, he broke the seal she didn't know was there with a knife. With his camera rolling, terry pulled the necklace out of his pocket, got down on one knee, cracked it open, and popped the question. After initial shock and confusion, anna \" finally worked out what had happened \" and yelled \" yes! \" before she \" pounced on me, \" he tells huffpost. Too sappy for you? she also kind of flipped out, saying: \" it's been in there the entire time? i could have lost it, you f --- ing idiot! \" terry tells the independent he had a few nervous moments along the way, too: at one point anna considered trading the necklace with a blacksmith for some of his work. They're now saving to buy a house and hope to marry in it. Smoo, by the way, means \" hiding place. \" ( this newborn helped his dad propose. )",

            "Is that a deer on the side of the road? no, actually; it's a robot planted by the florida fish and wildlife commission, and on saturday morning a florida man pulled over, got out of his car, and shot it, prompting police officers to emerge from a nearby hiding spot and charge him with shooting deer during closed season, discharging a firearm from a roadway, and taking deer from a right-of-way. \" he crossed a ditch and walked up toward the fence carrying a rifle, \" the report stated. \" he placed the rifle on the fence to steady himself and shot at the replica, \" hitting it in the neck. The man was arrested, saying he knew that hunting season was closed and that shooting deer from a roadway is illegal, and was released sunday after posting $ 1,120 in bonds. He will appear in court december 12, facing a year in jail and $ 2,500 in fines if convicted. The fwc often installs fake deer where illegal deer-harvesting is suspected. The most severe charge a hunter can incur by shooting one is a third-degree felony for firing across a fence line, called trespassing by projectile and offering a maximum sentence of five years in prison plus $ 5,000 in fines. \" it does help, \" said fwc officer jeffrey babauta. \" once",

Teenagers have a constitutional right to post racy photos of themselves online without being disciplined by their school, an indiana federal judge has ruled. The aclu filed a lawsuit on behalf of two girls who were suspended from high school cheerleading and a sports team after they posted photos of themselves getting overly friendly with \" phallic-shaped rainbow-colored lollipops, \" and other hot shots, according to court filings. The judge ruled that it was unconstitutional for administrators to discipline students for \" out of school conduct that brings dishonor or discredit upon the school. \" but the judge wasn't thrilled about the situation, reports forbes. \"not much good takes place at slumber parties for high school kids, and this case proves the point, \" writes judge philip smith. \"the speech in this case doesn't exactly call to mind high-minded civic discourse about current events. I wish the case involved more important and worthwhile speech. \" the photos were intended to be humorous \" in the mind of the intended teenage audience, \" even though they involved \" horsing around with objects representing sex organs, \" he added. Notes one tech lawyer: \" kudos to the judge for recognizing that these photos have significant speech implications, however questionable their wisdom or taste. \"",

The story of the carricks of whitehaven layers tragedy upon tragedy: passengers on the irish ship were trying to escape the potato famine that was killing their countrymen, only to see their ship go down in a storm while en route to quebec city. Of the nearly 200 people on the carricks, at least 80 are believed to have died off the gaspe coast. Parks canada archaeologist martin perron says the remains, which look to belong to five adults and three kids, appear to have been quickly deposited in what the canadian press calls a \" shallow trench \" — and could potentially be a mass grave. Bones have been found in the same area before. The globe and mail's report on the initial may 2011 find there noted that historical accounts describe victims as being laid out on the beach before burial, but no specific location of the grave was reported. It quotes some historical writings: a magazine article from the time noting the ship \" went to pieces in the course of two hours, \" and a 1919 book on gaspe that stated, \" for a whole day two oxcarts carried the dead to deep trenches near the scene of the disaster. \" a 2014 mail article reported that the bones found in 2011 were determined to be those of three european children who experienced malnutrition — suggesting they were very likely carricks victims.

The bios urn is a container built with 100 percent biodegradable materials in which a seed can grow in the ashes of departed friends or family.

        "summary": "Before its battery petered out, the small spacecraft that landed on a moving comet managed to detect organic molecules on the comet, reports nbc news. An instrument aboard the philae lander essentially sniffed the atmosphere and found evidence of the molecules, which, as the wall street journal explains, are the \" rudimentary building blocks of life. \" it might shed further light on the theory that a comet or comets smacked into a young earth and delivered the materials necessary for life. While the discovery isn't a huge surprise, it could prove especially interesting if the molecules are complex ones such as amino acids rather than simple ones such as methane, observes the journal. Further study is needed to figure out what kind of molecules were found, but it looks like scientists won't be getting any help from soil analysis. The lander drilled below the comet's surface to retrieve a frozen sample, which was to be analyzed in the lander's oven, but it now looks like no sample ever made it into the oven, reports the bbc. As scientists pore over data that the lander managed to send before going dark, they continue to hold out hope that the craft, which is equipped with solar panels, will wake up in the coming months as the comet moves closer to the sun. As for the newly discovered organic molecules, \" they could hold a key to early life on earth, \" writes sarah zhang at gizmodo. \" this is a big reason we sent rosetta all the way to a lonely comet in the first place. \"",

Or7 first attracted attention in 2011 when he abandoned his pack in northeastern oregon and trekked to california in search of — what else? — love and land, becoming in the process the first gray wolf seen in the golden state in 88 years. Or7 has since moved between california and oregon, and wolf experts tracking him via a collar transmitter ( which typically only last three years ) began to despair. \" we weren't going to ( re-collar him ), \" says john stephenson, a wolf biologist with the fish and wildlife service. \" he's a lone wolf. There's only so much information you can get. \" but then came a change. Or7 began \" denning \" — confining his wandering to a small area in southwestern oregon's cascade mountains — and lo and behold, wildlife cameras spotted another wolf in the area. This one is black and appears female, reports the la times. \" we don't know where this female came from, \" says stephenson, but or7's collar transmissions indicate \" this new wolf and or7 have paired up. \" better yet? \" if that is correct, they would be rearing pups at this time of year. \" experts will wait til at least next month to confirm the presence of pups, notes the oregonian, but they would be the first wolves in the area since early last century. The gray wolf was hunted nearly to extinction, and wildlife enthusiasts are ecstatic. \" in a decade there could be wolves recolonizing habitat in northern california, \" says one. \" he's certainly been there and checked it out. \" or7's story hits the big screen later this month.",

            "The wandering wolf or-7 appears to have a mate. Remote cameras in the rogue river-siskiyou national forest have captured several images of a black female in the same area as or-7, who has been on the move since 2011 in search of new territory and a mate to form a new pack. The images were recovered wednesday by john stephenson, wolf biologist for the u.s. Fish and wildlife service, as part of an ongoing wolf monitoring program by state and federal wildlife biologists. \" this information is not definitive, but it is likely that this new wolf and or-7 have paired up, \" stephenson said. He said transmissions from or-7's radio collar also indicate the two have denned. \" if that is correct, they would be rearing pups at this time of year, \" stephenson said. The two have never been in the same shot but they have passed the camera not long after each other, indicating they are aware of each other. Biologists determined that the black wolf was a female because she's smaller than or-7 and squats to urinate. U.s. Biologists and the oregon department of fish and wildlife will wait until june or later to confirm whether there are pups. If the two have produced offspring, they would be the first wolves known to breed in the oregon cascades since the early 20th century. Evidence of another wolf in the cascades surfaced in december, when biologists found tracks on the eastern slopes of mount hood. But there is no indication that those were the tracks of the black wolf, stephenson said. The news of an or-7 mate drew cheers from wildlife advocates. \" for people who appreciate native wildlife in oregon, the news doesn't get any bigger than this, \" said rob klavins of oregon wild. The discovery comes as the or-7 expedition readies a 1,200-mile trek retracing as much as possible of or-7's path.

        "summary": "The idea that facebook helped donald trump become president — an idea once dismissed by mark zuckerberg as \" pretty crazy \" — now looks anything but, writes media columnist margaret sullivan at the washington post. With the latest revelation that facebook sold ads to a russian \" troll farm, \" it's becoming ever clearer that misinformation spread through the site was a large factor in turning voters against hillary clinton. Sullivan cites a harvard study showing that propaganda factored large in the election and that facebook was the \" indispensable messenger \" in spreading allegations about clinton no matter how thin the evidence. \" would donald trump be president today if facebook didn't exist? \" asks sullivan. \" although there is a long list of reasons for his win, there's increasing reason to believe the answer is no. \" expect the site to continue downplaying its role, but it's time to stop taking the word of the \" terribly opaque enterprise, \" writes sullivan. What facebook won't acknowledge is that it is essentially a media company, one that serves as the main source of information for many of its users. And while it makes countless editorial decisions, it \" never owns them. \" at the new york times, meanwhile, a story lays out how russians created what amounts to an army of fake virtual americans who posted false information during the 2016 election. The story calls out not only facebook but twitter. These two companies \" essentially invented the tools of social media, \" but \" did not stop them from being turned into engines of deception and propaganda, \" writes scott shane.

Tragically, he succumbed to his injuries on monday, devastating lucas and seemingly destroying their plans for a family. But lucas wasn't prepared to let their dreams die: she decided to extract his sperm after he was declared brain-dead. \" when i found out cameron died, i was heartbroken, \" she tells the metro. \" but i realized immediately i wanted to have his baby and i knew that i didn't have long. \" unfortunately, the procedure to extract the sperm required thousands of dollars upfront — money lucas didn't have.

She wasn't sure how their families would feel about her decision, but both her mom and robinett's mom are on board and \" really supportive, \" she says. Robinett's sperm will be kept on ice for a year, though lucas isn't sure when she ' ll have it implanted. \" the grief is very raw at the moment, but i want his baby, our baby, \" she tells the metro. \" i've now been given the gift of a future.

Lawmakers rejected a motion to consider a ban on assault rifles by a vote of 71-36, reports the south florida sun sentinel. The decision to do so came with students from marjory stoneman douglas high school watching from the gallery. \" it seemed almost heartless how they immediately pushed the button to say no, \" sheryl acquaroli, a 16-year-old junior at the school, tells cnn. The measure hadn't been scheduled to come up tuesday, but a democratic lawmaker asked for a procedural change to consider the ban. The no vote means it will remain under consideration in three committees. Meanwhile, the lawmakers easily approved by voice vote a measure declaring that viewing pornography is a public health risk. Democratic state rep. Carlos guillermo smith was among those angry over the republican-proposed measure. \" he was saying porn as a health risk was more important to address here in the florida legislature than the epidemic of gun violence, \" smith told the ap, referring to gop lawmaker and resolution sponsor ross spano.

Scientists have discovered that two highly common herpes viruses tend to be present in an \" increased \" way in the brains of people who suffered from alzheimer's, according to a study published thursday in neuron of nearly 1,000 postmortem brains. Npr reports the study also found hhv-6 and hhv-7 may \" put gas on the flame, \" as study author joel dudley puts it, meaning the viruses ' presence could be speeding up the progress of the disease. Now, the word of caution, from national institute on aging director dr. Richard hodes: \" the data are very provocative, but fall short of showing a direct causal role. If viral infections are playing a part, they are not the sole actor. \" dudley elaborates on that point, saying the presence of the viruses in the brain doesn't trigger alzheimer's, but something — which isn't yet known — may be waking up the viruses and causing them to start replicating. The finding does suggest at least one course of action, which hodes says the institute will be testing: dosing people who have high herpes levels in the brain with antiviral drugs. Live science notes that \" it may sound startling to learn that there are strains of herpes in the brain, \" but it really isn't. Lead study author dr. Benjamin readhead says nearly one of every two brain tissues analyzed had the viruses; it's just that the alzheimer's brains had up to twice as much.

Lacking a precise method to determine time of death, pathologists essentially make a good guess. But a new study focused on the necrobiome — the world of organisms involved in decomposition, including bacteria — could change the game for forensic scientists. \" by knowing which microbes take over a dead body and how long it takes, forensic scientists might be able to use this technique to determine time of death or other aspects of a crime scene, \" one expert says in a statement. Writing in the journal plos one, researchers from cuny say the current \" crude \" methods for examining a corpse involve a physical inspection for signs of decomposition and for insects present. \" these techniques are notoriously unreliable, \" they explain, because they are skewed by temperature and weather conditions, among other factors. Researchers placed 21 cadavers outdoors in a temperate forest to decompose naturally over several weeks, and then studied their necrobiomes by swabbing bacteria from ears and nostrils. They used the findings over time to build a statistical model that can map time of death to up to 55 \" accumulated degree-days, \" or about two summer days. \" when it comes to rates of decay, one day in summer time is like two weeks in winter time, \" lead author nathan lents tells livescience.

I just can't take seriously the idea that she ' ll ever be president, even after her moderately successful softball game with oprah. Palin sealed that fate when she quit being governor ( although maybe she can run with lou dobbs on the all quitters ticket in 2012 ). She ' ll never obtain the record or the reliability she needs to run credibly for president now that she gave up the modestly challenging job of running alaska. I don't see her ever having the self-discipline or the humility to admit how very much she'd need to learn to be remotely qualified. On top of everything else, she seems like a vindictive, spiteful person, judging from her reputation in alaska politics, her open warfare with the mccain campaign and her juvenile tit-for-tat with her 19-year-old grandbaby-daddy levi johnston.

The environmental justice foundation report, published wednesday, cites a case of slave labor in which 15 burmese people, paid little or nothing, were allegedly beaten and forced to work 20 hours a day for thai fishermen. Those burmese workers, since rescued, say they saw their countrymen murdered and tortured on thai ships. \" this is not an isolated case, but indicative of the widespread acceptance and use of modern slavery in an industry that feeds a global appetite for seafood, \" says an ejf rep. For the past three years, the us state department has placed thailand on the tier 2 watch list for human trafficking. That's out of three tiers, the christian science monitor reports, and a move to tier 3 — as activists are requesting — would put thailand among the world's biggest offenders. But thailand exported $ 1.8 billion in fish products to the us in 2011; the countries'strong relationship makes the odds of a downgrade slim, some experts say. This month, a top thai official pledged improvements during a meeting with john kerry; he asked the secretary of state not to alter thailand's status.",

The report details testimonies of crew murdered at sea, and on shore, and the shocking figure from a 2009 survey by the united nations inter-agency project on human trafficking ( uniap ) that found 59 % of interviewed migrants trafficked about thai fishing boats reported witnessing the murder of a fellow worker.

Happiness is a learning center daycare in vinita agreed to cease operations while the state department of human services and police investigate, says dhs spokeswoman debra martin. \" they're trying to determine exactly what happened, who was involved, and whether or not compliance issues were broken, \" martin says. Shaunna broadway tells kotv that a daycare worker let her 5- and 7-year-old sons play outside friday without shirts or sunscreen. Photos show the boys ' back and shoulders covered with giant blisters. \" whether it was intentional or not intentional, they were supposed to take care of them, and they did not — and that's the bottom line, \" says broadway. \" i ' m a single parent, and i do all i can, \" broadway tells the station. \" i work monday through friday, and they have to go to daycare. \" broadway says she initially took her boys to a tulsa hospital, but that because of the severity of the burns, they were flown to a children's facility in texas. A gofundme page set up for the boys was originally yanked because a photo of the burns was deemed too graphic, a relative tells the blaze. The page says conner suffered second- and third-degree burns, while trey's were second-degree. Meanwhile, a review of oklahoma dhs records shows the facility has been cited 19 times since sept. 30, mostly for violations connected to staffing and signage. Martin said there are no plans for the daycare to reopen. ( you can see two photos of the burns here; warning, they're graphic. )",

Variety reports 11 years after the former vice president's oscar-winning documentary an inconvenient truth first warned about the dangers of climate change, an inconvenient sequel: truth to power premiered during the opening night of the 2017 sundance film festival. The new film takes an even more detailed look at the effects of climate change, business insider reports. According to vulture, the new film is \" less like a horror show and more like a tragedy \" due to the fact that some of gore's predictions in the first film ended up coming true — as evidenced by flooding in new york city during hurricane sandy — not to mention a climate change-denier being tapped to head the epa. But while an inconvenient sequel can be bleak — highlights include flooding in miami, air pollution in china, and melting glaciers in greenland — there's also optimism. Gore visits georgetown, texas, where the republican mayor is committing the town to 100 % renewable energy because, of all things, it's cheaper. \" we are going to win this, \" gore told the audience after his film's premiere thursday, adding, \" this story has many chapters yet to unfold. \" gore, who received a standing ovation from many in attendance, describes the election of donald trump, whom he visited with at trump tower, as just another hurdle to clear in the fight against climate change.",

        "summary": "Japan's parliament today attracted protesters and opposition lawmaker walkouts after its lower house voted to allow the country's military to fight overseas, a power eschewed since wwii, the new york times reports. A package of 11 security-themed bills supported by pm shinzo abe and the us — and given the thumbs down by about 80 % of japanese voters, the ap notes — was pushed through, setting off protests not seen since the 2011 fukushima nuclear accident, the times notes. Abe says the legislation, which allows japan to give us forces both logistical aid and/or armed backup in certain international situations, is needed to protect japan against threats like china and isis, which killed two japanese hostages this year. \" the security environment surrounding japan is becoming increasingly harsh, \" he said in a post-vote statement, per the ap. The times notes more than 90 % of the country's constitutional experts say this is a violation of japan's post-wwii charter, which reads in part: \" aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. \" critics also fear japan getting sucked into unpalatable wars, which abe says won't happen, saying japan could participate in an overseas conflict only if not doing so would put \" the lives and survival of the japanese nation \" at risk — a condition critics say is too nebulous, per the times. The law must still pass parliament's upper house, controlled by abe's liberal democratic party and the conservative coalition that also control the lower house, the times notes. Also in abe's favor: the lower house can override the upper house's decision. ( japanese manufacturers are jumping into the weapons business. )",

Wallace, one of the \" angola three \" found guilty of the 1972 murder of a guard, was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer this year, the new orleans times-picayune reports. He was released after a judge ruled that his murder conviction was unconstitutional and denied the state's request to overturn the order. The 71-year-old's lawyers say he is now bound for a hospital in new orleans. Wallace has always denied killing the guard, saying he was targeted because he helped set up a chapter of the black panther party at the notorious louisiana state penitentiary in angola and led strikes for better conditions, the ap reports. \" tragically, this step toward justice has come as herman is dying from cancer with only days or hours left to live, \" an amnesty international spokesman says. \" no ruling can erase the cruel, inhuman and degrading prison conditions he endured for more than 41 years. \" one of the two other men convicted of the guard's killing was released in 2001, while the other is still in solitary confinement.",

        "summary": "Scotland voted to remain part of the united kingdom, but that doesn't mean there are no changes in store. The bbc, telegraph, usa today, and cnn run down what's next for the country and the uk: scottish parliament will get more power. That's something the three biggest political parties in the uk agreed upon if scotland rejected independence, and as soon as the results were announced, prime minister david cameron announced that the process would begin. He named lord smith of kelvin to oversee the process of devolving powers related to tax, spending, and welfare to scotland, with draft legislation ready by january. Usa today notes that the increased powers will amount to \" a version of home rule in all matters of state save for certain key areas such as defense and monetary policy. \" it's good news for david cameron. As usa today notes, he can expect greater job security since he avoided becoming \" the prime minister who lost scotland. \" but cnn points out that it was \" the narrowest of political escapes. \" and as for the credit for keeping the uk together, many are giving that to former pm gordon brown. Other parts of the uk could follow scotland's lead. With scotland being granted \" much more constitutional freedom, \" an expert tells usa today that wales and northern ireland could seek the same additional legislative powers. And there's the \" west lothian \" question: the issue of whether it's fair that scottish mps can vote on england-only issues, but english mps can't similarly vote on devolved issues in scotland will likely heat up as more powers are devolved to scotland, making for more areas that english mps can't weigh in on. And \" brexit \" is still a possibility. Usa today predicts the uk's relationships with the european union, nato, and other international organizations will not see major upheaval. But the telegraph paints a different picture, saying the chances of the uk exiting the european union are \" now higher than they were, though not as high as if scotland had voted yes. \" \" all eyes \" will be on the snp's annual conference. The perth meeting will be held in november, and the bbc notes that there could be some contention among the ranks, with rival politicians likely to try and paint leader alex salmond as a \" lame duck. \" what about the emotional aftermath? the debate has been heated, so on sunday, the church of scotland will hold a \" reconciliation service \" in edinburgh as a first step toward bringing the nation back",

Through the weekend, the holiday hole website featured a livestream of an excavator digging a good-sized hole in an undisclosed spot, and it invited people to contribute to keep the project going. The digging has now stopped, with the final tally at $ 100,573. \" it is, in the truest, most literal sense of the phrase, a money pit, \" notes a post at mcclatchy news.

It had then been some 12 hours since a woman had discovered the crying boy alone at the crazy corn maze in the salt lake city suburb of west jordan and brought him to the maze owners.

An appeals court ruling in october gave an attorney who's also a registered nurse limited guardianship over sarah and the power to make medical decisions for her. The court said the beliefs and convictions of her parents can't outweigh the rights of the state to protect the child.

        "summary": "Dead puffins are washing up on the shores of an island in the bering sea at an alarming rate, national geographic reports. \" in 10 years of monitoring, we've only seen six puffins wash in — total, \" a professor who coordinates a west coast volunteer bird-monitoring network says. In just shy of three weeks, they've seen 250. Scientists believe the actual number of dead puffins is much higher, to the point that half the puffin population in the north pacific may be dead. The cause is no great mystery: the birds are simply starving to death. And scientists are concerned what that means for other animal populations in the bering sea, which provides a good chunk of north america's seafood, from crab to salmon to the pollock found in fish sticks. The culprit appears to be water temperatures that were \" off-the-charts warm \" this year, according to noaa ecologist nata mantua. Even the normally chill water found at the bottom of the bering sea was 6 degrees celsius above normal. The warm water not only killed off the fatty zooplankton fish rely on for food, but almost all zoo plankton; that hurt fish populations, which meant less food for mammals and birds. In august, the portland press herald reported on the woes plaguing the largest puffin colony in the gulf of maine. On machias seal island, 60 % of puffin nests that hold eggs produce viable chicks who ultimately enter the sea; this year it was 12 %, and those who didn't starve to death were notably small. Scientists theorize a warming gulf impacted the food supply there, too. ( there's other drama happening at machias seal island. )",

A stretch of water that provides more seafood than any other in north america saw such record-warm temperatures earlier this year that scientists suspect the ocean food web there has shifted.

The paper explains that investigators of the may 6, 1937, disaster determined that a spark ignited leaking gas, but were unable to definitively determine the source of the spark or the gas leak. Others believed sabotage, by way of a bomb or a shooter stationed on the ground, was to blame, but the team outlines a more scientific series of events: it believes an electrical storm caused the hindenburg to be charged with static electricity; when the crew members on the ground in new jersey grabbed the landing ropes, they \" earthed \" the hindenburg ( ie, connected it electrically to the ground ). That caused the spark that perilously ignited the hydrogen that had leaked into the ventilation shafts by way of a broken wire or sticking gas valve. An airship historian says he thinks the team's finding is \" exactly what happened. I think you had an ignition source pull down into the ship, and that whole back portion of the ship went up almost at once. \" the news follows bloomberg's profile of a resurgent airship industry; it reports that a drop in the cost of carbon fiber and advances in buoyancy technology have manufacturers asserting that their coming ships will be able to steal business from freight operators by 2016.",

        "summary": "In what cnn frames as an \" extremely unusual \" move, a us airstrike on sunday reportedly destroyed a massive amount of money at an isis storage facility in mosul, iraq. It's \" probably \" the biggest strike against the militant group's cash sites to date, a pentagon official tells afp via the guardian. \" we estimate in the millions of dollars … from all their illicit stuff: oil, looting, extortion, \" the official says, with a us military spokesman adding that \" the bulk cash distribution site was used by [ isis ] to distribute money to fund terrorist activities. \" two 2,000-pound bombs were dropped on the site, and the defense officials indicate to cnn that this is likely just the first of many strikes against isis financial targets. It's not clear whether the money was in the form of local, us, or foreign currency, the guardian adds. Perhaps the most sensitive part of the strike involves civilian deaths, estimated to be between five and seven. Because it's been getting heat for not working quickly enough against isis, the pentagon has indicated it would consider striking more targets, and accepting the possibility of more civilian deaths — as long as it meant the us-led coalition was reaping sufficient gains against isis, the guardian reports. In this case, defense officials say that commanders were \" willing to consider up to 50 civilian casualties, \" cnn reports, and that they purposely waited till dawn on sunday to strike to try to keep the figure low. Meanwhile, isis posted a video ( still not verified ) on monday allegedly showing the destruction of the site, haaretz reports. Two local residents confirmed to reuters that it was a bank in one of the city's eastern districts. ( maybe isis currency was lost. )",

        "summary": "They were considered the eighth natural wonder of the world and the greatest tourist attraction in the southern hemisphere in the mid-1800s — and then they were gone: the pink and white terraces of lake rotomahana in new zealand's north island spellbound visitors until june 1886 when mount tarawera erupted, wiping the silica sinter ( a kind of quartz ) formations off the map. Now researchers say they have located the fabled wonder, claiming the formations may well have survived the disaster but are now buried under mud and ash. Rex bunn and dr. Sascha nolden say they've corrected past attempts to identify the location of the terraces thanks to the 19th-century field diaries of a german-austrian geologist. Bunn tells the guardian the terraces were never surveyed by the government, meaning their exact latitude and longitude weren't determined. But someone did record their compass bearings: ferdinand von hochstetter, whose diary data the researchers used to reverse engineer the terrace locations. The researchers believe they're buried no more than 50 feet under the surface skirting the shoreline and not beneath the lake, as previously believed, or totally destroyed, as government scientists recently have claimed, newsnow reports. The pair are raising funds to conduct a full archaeological study and prove their claim — and say that if they're right, it's possible the terraces could be brought back to life. In 2016, the bbc explained just why they were so stunning: not only were they the largest silica sinter formations on the planet, they sat at opposite ends of the lake, one white, one slightly pink, their positioning making them \" greater than the sum of their parts. \" ( petra's secret was found hiding in plain sight. )",

In the early hours of 10 june 1886, mount tarawera, a volcano on the north island of new zealand, erupted with astonishing force. The explosions may have been heard as far afield as christchurch, more than 400 miles ( 640km ) to the south-west. The eruption killed 120 people, most of them maoris – native new zealanders – living in small villages in the surrounding countryside. But it is not just because of its high death toll that the tarawera eruption is firmly lodged in the collective memory of new zealanders. Most people also remember the eruption because it robbed the island nation of a treasured natural wonder: the pink and white terraces of lake rotomahana. The terraces were the two largest formations of silica sinter – a fine-grained version of quartz – ever known to have existed on earth. They were located on opposite shores of lake rotomahana, situated six miles ( 10km ) to the south-west of mount tarawera. And they were extraordinarily beautiful. The terraces are sometimes even described as the eighth wonder of the world. One was a brilliant white colour, while the other, due to an unknown chemical impurity, was tinged a light shade of pink.
