He made the announcement at a friday press conference alongside a smiling bush, per cnn. \" his endorsement is very meaningful and along with it come a lot of friends and supporters of his, \" bush told fox news, per nbc news. However, at least one political analyst is questioning the move. \" a guy with 0 % ( graham ) endorses someone with 5 % ( bush ), \" matthew dowd wrote on twitter. \" what kind of strategy is this? no wonder trump is winning. \" on the bush front, politico reports most of the two dozen big donors it interviewed are simply waiting for bush to throw in the towel so they can open their wallets for another candidate ( politico predicts bush's current \" wall street support \" will move on to marco rubio ). \" i ' m resigned to it being over, frankly, \" says one. Another adds the current fundraising pitch for the bush camp is, \" i need you to throw away money on jeb — out of loyalty \" to the bush family.",

The map's accuracy could improve further if the number of subdivisions increases, the good design award description notes, but as it currently stands the map \" faithfully represents all oceans, continents including the neglected antarctica. \" it won't necessarily sound the death knell for the mercator projection, though; popular mechanics points out it \" doesn't align according to the cardinal directions. \" it's on sale in poster and globe form through its own authagraph site.

At the meeting wildstein said he attended in christie's office in june 2010, with christie and other members of the governor's inner circle in attendance, the governor reportedly informed port authority officials they were to fire arthur cifelli, who held two high-up roles with the agency, and replace him with gerard speziale, then passaic county's sheriff. One of the reasons christie gave for the firing, per wildstein's statement: the governor reportedly said he \" would not have cifelli working for his administration \" due to the fact he perjured himself during grand jury proceedings for a case involving john lynch, an ex-senate president for new jersey. The times notes that, except in rare circumstances that don't seem to apply here, one may not id someone who has testified in a grand jury case. Wildstein's statement says there may be more to come, including other \" documents to be produced for inspection. \" meanwhile, christie's spokesman, who calls wildstein's claims \" legal jockeying, \" tells the times that \" anyone suggesting the governor disclosed grand jury information is either lying or mistaken. \" ( recent reaction to christie's possible presidential run is lukewarm at best. )",

        "summary": "This week, italy's highest court ruled it's not illegal for a starving homeless person to steal food needed to survive, the guardian reports. The ruling stems from a 2011 incident in which a homeless man named roman ostriakov paid for a bag of breadsticks at a supermarket while concealing a small amount of cheese and sausage. Ostriakov was sentenced to six months in jail and a fine in 2013, but that conviction has now been overturned by italy's supreme court. \" the condition of the defendant, and the circumstances in which the seizure of merchandise took place, prove that he took possession of that small amount of food in the face of an immediate and essential need for nourishment, \" cnn quotes the court as saying. The decision was hailed by many. One italian columnist writes the ruling shows the \" right to survival prevails over property, \" the bbc reports. That same columnist says it's a ruling that would be \" blasphemy in america. \" \" the supreme court has established a sacrosanct principle: a small theft because of hunger is in no way comparable to an act of delinquency, because the need to feed justifies the fact, \" the guardian quotes the president of a consumer rights group as saying. Others complained that it took a three-part trial over the theft of less than $ 5 worth of food just to conclude that no crime had been committed.",

        "summary": "The monuments men are famous for rescuing art looted from jewish families during world war ii — but it turns out that many pieces never made it back to their original owners. That's because when the famed group turned over the artwork to the bavarian state after the war, the state sold some of it back to nazi families on the cheap, according to new research, per the art newspaper. Anne webber of the commission for looted art in europe says bavaria's state paintings collections was given 10,600 items in 1949 that were to be returned to jewish families but were instead offered to germans, including prominent nazis. Webber says she uncovered the scheme after tracing a painting stolen from a jewish family during the war that ended up in the hands of hitler's photographer, heinrich hoffmann. The monuments men seized it back and turned it over to the bavarian state — which sold it back to hoffmann's daughter at a low price. \" it seems that bavaria thought restitution meant restitution to the nazis rather than to their victims, \" the clae says, per the times of israel. Webber accuses german authorities of stonewalling the requests of jewish families for restitution even as it lowered the bar on german requests. \" it is particularly striking that the hoffmann family was getting virtually everything back that it claimed with minimal proof of ownership and this went on for almost two decades. \" the investigation, done jointly with the munich paper süddeutsche zeitung, also accuses state museums of keeping artwork in their own collections and tying to disguise the origins. The state paintings collections denies wrongdoing and says it's focused on finding \" fair and just solutions \" to jewish claims. ( found: a hang-dug tunnel used to escape the nazis. )",

The houston express container ship contacted the coast guard after it spotted his sailboat drifting in the atlantic ocean around 200 miles off the coast of north carolina, reports cnn. A coast guard helicopter took jordan from the container ship to a hospital in virginia, where he was treated for a shoulder injury. The 37-year-old, who calls himself an inexperienced sailor, says that after his boat capsized in rough weather, the mast was broken and all electronics were disabled, wavy reports. He was apparently able to right the boat, because cnn notes that jordan says it capsized two more times before he was finally spotted; the ap reports that he was ultimately found sitting on its overturned hull. The coast guard says jordan, who was reported missing by his family on jan. 29, survived by rationing the food he had on board, catching fish in a net, and drinking rainwater. In audio released by the coast guard, jordan's father tells him the family \" prayed and we prayed, and we hoped that you were still alive, \" wavy reports. Jordan replies: \" i was just praying about you, ' cause i was afraid that you guys were crying and sad that i was dead. \" \" we were, \" his father says. \" i thought i lost you. \" jordan's father also thanked the ship captain who spotted his son. \" you're a good man, \" he says, according to abc news. \" i ' m grateful for the system that we have. \" ( another man lost at sea survived by clinging to a foam cooler. )",

A crowd at steveston wharf in richmond, british columbia, gasps as a young girl is pulled by her dress into the water by a california sea lion. Cbc news reports michael fujiwara pulled out his phone when a sea lion surfaced and began swimming around the dock on saturday. About 1: 25 into the video, the mammal jumps from the water near the girl's face to laughter from the child and those watching; 15 seconds later, the animal grabs the waist of her dress as she perches on the dock's ledge and drags her beneath the surface in an instant. An unidentified man jumps into the water as onlookers scream. He is able to promptly retrieve the girl, who leaves quickly with her family; fujiwara describes them as \" pretty shaken up. \" fujiwara claims people were feeding the sea lion breadcrumbs, something steveston harbour authority gm bob baziuk warns against. \" it's not sea world. It's a place where you buy fish, \" baziuk tells cnn. \" if you feed the animals like this you're asking for trouble. \" baziuk says neither the girl nor her rescuer were hurt, and that he is seeking more information about the incident. A marine mammal expert at the university of british columbia believes the sea lion, which he confirmed was a male, misread the situation: \" it would appear that the sea lion sees part of her dress, thinks it's food, reaches up, grabs at the food, and pulls her in by the dress.

        "summary": "A trio of new studies has breathed life back into a dramatic theory about the birth of the moon. Scientists have long suspected that the moon was formed when a mars-sized planet called theia smashed into earth, obliterating itself and creating the moon, the la times explains. The problem? the moon is geologically identical to earth, making it hard to believe it's leftovers from another world. Here's how new studies are changing that belief: the first, published in science posits that the earth was spinning incredibly fast back then, with days lasting just two to three hours. At that speed, the collision might destroy both worlds, and the two bodies would mix together to form the moon. The second study, also published in science, hypothesizes that two planets of about the same size might have collided and mixed together to form the earth, throwing the moon off in the process. Such an impact would have sped up the earth's rotation, but the first study shows how that rotation could have been slowed down since. Another study published in nature analyzed rocks brought back from the apollo missions, and concluded that lots of water boiled away during the moon's birth, space.com reports. That implies \" a big event with lots of energy, \" supporting the impact theory, a geochemist tells the times.",

( nasa / ) scientists may never know exactly how the moon and earth were formed some 4.5 billion years ago, but this week their understanding of the cataclysmic event made a significant leap forward. In a slew of studies published wednesday, planetary scientists provided new evidence supporting the long-standing — but imperfect — theory that the earth and moon formed after the proto-earth collided with another huge planetary body, sometimes referred to as theia. Some of that evidence comes from super-precise measurements of the zinc in lunar rock samples collected by apollo astronauts. These findings, reported in the journal nature, support the idea that the moon's birth had to have resulted from \" a big event with lots of energy, \" strong enough to vaporize rock, said study leader frederic moynier, a geochemist at washington university. Separately, two studies published in the journal science detailed two scenarios of what such a powerful crash might plausibly have looked like.

The new research potentially plugs a big hole in the giant impact theory, long the leading explanation for the moon's formation. Previous versions of the theory held that the moon formed primarily from pieces of a mysterious mars-size body that slammed into a proto-earth — but that presented a problem, because scientists know that the moon and earth are made of the same stuff. The two studies both explain how earth and the moon came to be geochemical twins. However, they offer differing versions of the enormous smashup that apparently created earth's natural satellite, giving scientists plenty to chew on going forward.

Beginning monday, a 20-mile stretch of california coastline from encinitas to la jolla took on what cnn calls an \" electric blue glow \" as tiny bioluminescent creatures moved in. Despite sharing his own photos with npr, a professional photographer says \" no photo can really do it justice, \" adding the glow was \" much less vibrant \" but \" still beautiful \" as of tuesday night. Scientists credit a bloom of dinoflagellates, also known as a red tide. The microorganisms give the water a reddish hue in daylight, but at night, they appear to glow as they're disturbed by waves. Npr reports huge crowds have been flocking to witness the phenomenon, which scientists have been observing for decades. It's unclear how long it will be visible. Red tides have previously lasted a few days to beyond a month.",

An experiment to prove just that has been running in brisbane since 1927 — and now comes the news that the scientist who has headed the experiment since 1961 died last week without ever seeing it drop. He was 78. John mainstone was actually responsible for resurrecting the experiment, which had \" been relegated to some dusty cupboard \" at the university of queensland, reports popular science. As the \" custodian of the world's longest-running science experiment, \" drops did fall on his watch — eight have done so since its start — but mainstone was never present for one. Two sad misses: mainstone failed to capture a 2000 drop because the camera trained on it faltered; physorg reports that he expected the ninth drop to fall this year. ( you can monitor it here. ) though mainstone retired in 1996, the australian notes that he kept an office at the school and continued in his \" custodian \" role. He was awarded an ig nobel in 2005.

Parnell was trying to demonstrate that although pitch is so brittle that it ' ll shatter under a hammer blow, it is actually a liquid at room temperature and will flow and form drops. The only problem was that the drop formation is extremely slow, with eight and nine years passing between the first three drops. By the time mainstone joined the university of queensland faculty in 1961, parnell's pitch drop demonstration had been relegated to some dusty cupboard.

It took three years for the pitch to settle and then the glass funnel holding the substance was cut to allow it to flow out. In the 83 years since then, only eight drops of pitch have fallen and no one has seen one actually fall, the university said.

This year's global average temperature was 58.5 degrees fahrenheit at the end of october. The christian science monitor reports that's 0.27 degrees warmer than the average temperature in 2014. And while the naturally occurring el niño is partially to blame, scientists estimate it likely accounts for less than 20 % of the temperature increase. According to the journal, 2011 to 2015 has been the warmest five years on record. The wmo made its announcement only days before a two-week global summit on climate change in paris, reuters reports. According to the journal, the goal of the international conference is to get both developed and developing countries to agree to measures cutting greenhouse gas emissions. \"greenhouse gas emissions, which are causing climate change, can be controlled, \" jarraud says. \"we have the knowledge and the tools to act. \" according to the monitor, the wmo wants to keep global average temperatures within 2 degrees celsius of what they were in preindustrial times. Right now the earth is about 1 degree over. \" the more we wait for action, the more difficult it will be, \" jarraud says. He adds that ordinary citizens can help by using public transportation and insulating their homes.",

Michael finn is lucky to be alive after being pulled out of california's klamath river early wednesday after an accident that sent his ford fusion flying into the water, overturned for almost five hours, the california highway patrol tells kdrv.

He tells police he thinks he crashed around 3am. Kval cites the \" multiple agencies \" that were involved in getting the 28-year-old and his car out of the river, with firefighters, chp officers, divers, emts, and a towing company all playing a part. One siskiyou county sheriff's office diver in particular was \" extremely instrumental \" in the rescue, jumping into the water to hook finn's car up to a towline, per kdrv and kobi-tv.

        "summary": "For 29 years, motel owner gerald foos watched hundreds, perhaps thousands, of guests having sex, going to the bathroom, and more at the manor house motel in colorado. Now the story of the \" greatest voyeur in the world \" is out in the open, thanks to an article published in the new yorker by journalist gay talese. The author says he first learned of foos when the latter wrote him a letter in 1980. \" sexually, i have witnessed, observed, and studied the best first hand, unrehearsed, non-laboratory sex between couples, and most other conceivable sex deviations during these past 15 years, \" it read. Foos — who sold the motel in 1995 — wanted to be seen as a \" sex researcher and social observer, \" not a mere peeping tom and pervert, according to the denver post. To that end, foos kept detailed notes of everything he witnessed through his fake ceiling vents. For example, in 1973 he catalogued 184 male orgasms and 33 female orgasms, and noted that white heterosexuals tended to have missionary sex and that only 3 % of his guests failed to have sex. Talese even joined foos in his attic \" laboratory \" on at least one occasion and found the man had an \" uncontrollable desire to peer into other people's lives. \" the statute of limitations has passed on any voyeur-related crimes, reports the post, but talese writes that foos could face trouble over a 1977 murder he says he witnessed but never reported — assuming it actually happened. Foos tells the post that talese's article could \" create a real situation. \" \" i don't know if i ' m ready for anything, to be honest with you, \" he says. \" i ' m just a poor soul. \" foos maintains that no guests were ever harmed by his voyeurism as they never knew they were being watched.

Canuck can be seen defecating on his makeshift perch, before flying at the table where the woman has her back turned. The table's occupants kick the bird away with their feet. Later on, canuck flies onto another table, and appears to be helping himself to a woman's food. She grabs the bird's tail, lifts him into the air and moves him around as he squawks.

Ahmed dogan, leader of bulgaria's ethnic turks, was giving a televised speech in sofia when a man stormed the stage and aimed a gun at his head. The assailant tried to fire two rounds but \" most likely the gun misfired, \" an official said. Dogan, 58, pushed away the weapon — a non-lethal but still-dangerous gas gun — before security guards wrestled the attacker to the ground, reports afp. See it on video here. Police arrested the man, whose rap sheet included robbery and drug-possession convictions. Dogan retired a few hours later, as had been expected: \" this time my decision is categorical! \" he said. His address, finished later by another member of the movement for rights and freedoms party, criticized the \" demonization \" of dogan ahead of july elections. Dogan has led the nation's 10 % turkish minority for 23 years but faced mounting criticism from all sides, often for his authoritarian style and alleged corruption.",

Due to recent revisions to the rules of succession, this little one — fourth in line to the british throne — will actually keep her spot in line even if wills and kate have another male child, making her the first female royal heir in almost 1,000 years to do so. Speaking of third babies, within minutes of the official royal baby announcement, the telegraph was already wondering, \" after baby number two, will kate have a third child? \" the paper explains that kate, 33, has reportedly told friends her goal is to have three children before she hits 35. But before that, what to expect in the immediate future: usa today reports that kate will likely spend at least one night in the hospital, during which period she may be visited by her and william's families — as well as, possibly, the couple's first child, prince george, who is not often seen in public. When she is ready to leave, prince william may drive the newly-expanded family home to kensington palace after first posing for pictures for the crowd gathered outside the hospital, as he did last time around. They ' ll likely spend a few days at the palace, then go to anmer hall, their country retreat, where kate's mom carole middleton is expected to help with the baby. As for the first pictures after the hospital departure, last time, the family released some casual shots soon after prince george was born.

Miriam rodríguez martínez, known for standing up to the zetas drug cartel by bringing her girl's killers to justice, was shot in her san fernando home. The bbc reports a zetas member who had been convicted of killing her daughter, karen alejandra, escaped from jail in march; the new york times'report states more than one escaped. Whatever the number, rodríguez began receiving death threats. Tamaulipas attorney general irving barrios tells reuters police began thrice-daily patrols around her house, but those close to her say she didn't get the protection she needed. The times provides some location-based context: the state of tamaulipas, which borders the southern tip of texas, is plagued with the highest missing persons rate in the country. Her two-year search for her daughter ended with rodríguez finding the unmarked grave karen was buried in; the information and names she passed to police resulted in the arrests and trials of what barrios says were nine people. Rodríguez went on to become director of colectivo de desaparecidos de san fernando, an organization supporting 600 families searching for disappeared relatives. Tamaulipas ' governor addressed the tragedy, tweeting ( translated ): \" the government... Will not allow the death of miriam rodríguez to turn into yet another statistic. \"",

He says \" the agency is exploring all options including alternate sources... Or an alternate drug. \" it isn't clear whether two executions scheduled for next month will be delayed. The state last year switched to the single-dose drug, which is more commonly used to put down dogs and cats, due to shortages of the drugs used in its three-drug execution process.

To get a clearer picture, the team put together two teams of 30 participants each and had them play \" go or no go, \" in which they hit a go button when the letter f flashed on a screen and do nothing when the letter e appeared. The subjects, half of whom had taken 1,000mg of acetaminophen, were hooked up to an eeg to measure brain activity. The group that had taken the equivalent of a normal maximum dose of the painkiller hit the go button more often when e flashed on the screen, according to upi.

Next on the agenda for the researchers: to study whether acetaminophen causes people to \" mind wander, \" and to answer the question of whether the drug, in addition to inhibiting the ability to detect errors, also contributes to people making more mistakes. Past research has suggested that acetaminophen may reduce the pain of social rejection, \" sort of like alcohol or xanax, \" the atlantic reported in 2013.

Given this diversity of consequences, it has been proposed that the psychological effects of acetaminophen may reflect a widespread blunting of evaluative processing.

A new study suggests it might be: more than 60 % of wine sipped by \"high-frequency wine drinkers \" — those who drink wine several times weekly — isn't accompanied by a meal. It just goes to show, argues wine blogger alder yarrow, that the chatter over correct pairings is propagated by the wine establishment, perhaps as a moneymaking move. \" for every glass carefully chosen to go with a specific dish, there appear to eight more consumed in the same way most people drink a scotch, \" writes yarrow at vinography. \"i can only barely imagine what might happen if wine writing and the attentions of wine lovers actually matched their real behavior, \" muses yarrow, who has for years called \"correct \" pairing a lie. \"would wine drinkers feel free to not only drink whatever they like, but to explore and experiment in their wine choices without fear of doing something wrong? would more people actually drink wine because they knew it didn't always have to go with food? \" ( click for more complaints about fancy wine talk. )",

        "summary": "A conservative writer and associate of trump confidant roger stone said friday that he is in plea talks with special counsel robert mueller's team. Jerome corsi told the ap he has been negotiating a potential plea but declined to comment further. He said on a youtube show earlier this month that he expected to be charged with lying to federal investigators, though he said at the time that he was innocent of wrongdoing. Mueller's team questioned corsi as part of an investigation into stone's connections with wikileaks. American intelligence agencies have assessed that russia was the source of hacked material released by wikileaks during the 2016 election that damaged hillary clinton's campaign. Mueller's office is trying to determine whether stone and other associates of president trump had advance knowledge of wikileaks ' plans. The confirmation of plea talks — first reported by the washington post — comes as mueller's team has just received fresh information from trump personally and as federal prosecutors in virginia recently inadvertently disclosed the existence of sealed charges against wikileaks founder julian assange. It's unclear if the charges against assange are related to mueller's investigation, but wikileaks was singled out in an indictment last summer against a group of russian intelligence officers accused of carrying out the wide-ranging hack of clinton's campaign and other democratic organizations. It's also not known if any plea by corsi signals a new raft of charges by the special counsel or just that investigators are aggressively pursuing cases against people they believe made false statements to investigators. ( the assange development was revealed accidentally. )",

Starting sunday, individual government agencies will have to request data on specific calls from telephone companies. \" there is still a need to be able to identify communications between terrorists abroad and individuals with whom they are in contact in the united states, \" according to a statement from the office of the director of national intelligence.

            "An illustration picture shows the logo of the u.s. National security agency on the display of a phone in berlin, june 7, 2013. Washington the u.s. National security agency will end its daily vacuuming of millions of americans ' phone records by sunday and replace the practice with more tightly targeted surveillance methods, the obama administration said on friday. As required by law, the nsa will end its wide-ranging surveillance program by 11: 59 p.m. Est saturday ( 4: 59 a.m. Gmt sunday ) and expects to have the new, scaled-back system in place by then, the white house said. The transition is a long-awaited victory for privacy advocates and tech companies wary of broad government surveillance at a time when national security concerns are heightened in the wake of the paris attacks earlier this month. It comes two and a half years after the controversial program was exposed by former nsa contractor edward snowden. The move, mandated by a law passed six months ago, represents the greatest reduction of u.s. Spying capabilities since they expanded dramatically after the sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Under the freedom act, the nsa and law enforcement agencies can no longer collect telephone calling records in bulk in an effort to sniff out suspicious activity. Such records, known as \" metadata, \" reveal which numbers americans are calling and what time they place those calls, but not the content of the conversations. Instead analysts must now get a court order to ask telecommunications companies like verizon communications to enable monitoring of call records of specific people or groups for up to six months. \" the act struck a reasonable compromise which allows us to continue to protect the country while implementing various reforms, \" national security council spokesman ned price said. Some republican lawmakers want to preserve bulk collection until 2017, citing the nov. 13 paris attacks in which 130 people died. The islamic state has claimed responsibility for the killings.

            "An illustration picture shows the logo of the u.s. National security agency on the display of a phone in berlin, june 7, 2013. Washington the u.s. National security agency will end its daily vacuuming of millions of americans ' phone records by sunday and replace the practice with more tightly targeted surveillance methods, the obama administration said on friday. As required by law, the nsa will end its wide-ranging surveillance program by 11: 59 p.m. Est saturday ( 4: 59 a.m. Gmt sunday ) and expects to have the new, scaled-back system in place by then, the white house said. The transition is a long-awaited victory for privacy advocates and tech companies wary of broad government surveillance at a time when national security concerns are heightened in the wake of the paris attacks earlier this month. It comes two and a half years after the controversial program was exposed by former nsa contractor edward snowden. The move, mandated by a law passed six months ago, represents the greatest reduction of u.s. Spying capabilities since they expanded dramatically after the sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Under the freedom act, the nsa and law enforcement agencies can no longer collect telephone calling records in bulk in an effort to sniff out suspicious activity. Such records, known as \" metadata, \" reveal which numbers americans are calling and what time they place those calls, but not the content of the conversations. Instead analysts must now get a court order to ask telecommunications companies like verizon communications to enable monitoring of call records of specific people or groups for up to six months. \" the act struck a reasonable compromise which allows us to continue to protect the country while implementing various reforms, \" national security council spokesman ned price said. Some republican lawmakers want to preserve bulk collection until 2017, citing the nov. 13 paris attacks in which 130 people died. The islamic state has claimed responsibility for the killings. But any new surveillance measures are unlikely to become law ahead of the november 2016 presidential elections.

        "summary": "Film director randall miller pleaded guilty yesterday in the death of an assistant camera operator on the set of midnight rider. Sarah jones, 27, was killed last year while the gregg allman biopic was filming on a train trestle. A train going 55mph struck a metal-frame bed the crew put on the tracks; the flying bed reportedly knocked jones into the train. Miller pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass, and the los angeles times calls it \" a seminal moment in hollywood film history \" — the first time, as far as showbiz attorneys remember, a filmmaker has pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to an on-set accident. The sentence: up to two years in jail, eight years of probation, a fine of $ 20,000, 360 hours of community service, and a 10-year ban from serving as a director or assistant director. Part of his motivation for taking the deal: doing so got miller's wife and business partner, jody savin, out of her own involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass charges. Miller's lawyers had maintained the director believed he had permission to film on the trestle, though that permission had been obtained from the paper company that owns the land. The company said just two trains would pass that day, and the crew was surprised by a third. But the company that owns the track says it denied the filmmakers permission — twice, cbs news reports. Miller's lawyer maintains that the director believed the set was safe, but says he takes responsibility for jones'death.",

The 91-year-old former president, who was diagnosed with melanoma on the brain last summer and declared cancer-free in december, told the sunday school class he teaches in georgia that he no longer needs treatment for the disease, which he feared would kill him within weeks of the initial diagnosis, cnn reports. Carter, who will continue to receive scans to make sure the disease has not returned, was treated with radiation, surgery, and a form of immune-boosting treatment that experts have called a game changer for patients with melanoma. \" it's a treatment called immuno-therapy and it removed the obstacles to my own immune system to fight against cancer, basically — it's kind of complicated, \" carter told the class at maranatha baptist church in his hometown of plains, per wxia. \" but it's worked very well for me and i had an mri for two hours and 10 minutes and then the doctors determined that i didn't need any more treatment. \" an american cancer society spokesman tells the ap that carter was treated with keytruda, a relatively new immune-boosting drug, and the decision to stop treatment was clearly \" based on individual evidence specific to the president and made with his doctors. \"",

        "summary": "You may not realize it, but there are two forms of the print version of the lowercase letter \" g \" — and though you've likely seen one of those forms millions of times, chances are you can't write it, a new study finds. One version is the \" opentail \" one typically used when writing by hand; the other is the \" looptail \" one often used in typeset forms of the letter — meaning you encounter it in many of the books, newspapers, magazines, websites, and emails you read. ( the week notes that the only other letter with two lowercase printed forms is \" a. \" ) per a press release, the looptail version of \" g \" is \" by far the more common \" of the two. Yet when researchers from johns hopkins conducted a three-part experiment, first asking 38 adults to list letters with two lowercase print versions, only two of them said \" g, \" and only one of them could correctly write both forms. Some participants went so far as to insist there weren't two forms of the letter, a researcher says. \" we would say:'there're two forms of g. Can you write them? ' and people would look at us and just stare for a moment, because they had no idea, \" the researcher says. In the second part of the experiment, researchers found that even after reading a paragraph that included 14 of the looptail version, and saying each word that contained a \" g \" out loud, only half of them even attempted to write the looptail version of the letter when asked to write the type of \" g \" they had just encountered multiple times. Of those, just one person wrote it correctly. Finally, 25 participants were asked to identify the correct version of a looptail \" g \" when given four options ( see all four at the verge ); only seven could. \" they don't entirely know what this letter looks like, even though they can read it, \" the study co-author says. Researchers say the study highlights the importance of writing when it comes to learning letters — and suggest that, as writing declines with the popularity of electronic devices, reading might suffer.",

Political opponents, of course, slammed what one referred to as a \" tasteless and outrageous combination, \" the bbc reports. \" if you're serious about commemoration at such a place of horrors, then you don't pay such a visit during an election campaign, \" says one opposition leader. Merkel had been invited to the camp by the head of the dachau survivor group, a 93-year-old former inmate who was liberated by american soldiers in 1945, the ap reports. She laid a wreath at the site, saying the camp \" fills me with deep sadness and shame \" and stands for \" a horrible and unprecedented chapter of our history. \" but it can also serve as a warning, she noted: \" how did germany reach the point of taking away the right of people to live because of their origin, their religion...

            "Image copyright j.wang/acs image caption the biobattery tattoo is fuelled by lactate - naturally present in sweat after vigorous exercise a sweaty gym workout is not only good for your health - it could also energise your phone. A tattoo that produces power from perspiration has been unveiled at the american chemical society meeting. The biobattery is fuelled by lactate - which is naturally present in sweat after vigorous exercise. It could soon power heart monitors, digital watches and eventually even smartphones, say scientists in california. The dream of \" people power \" - using the body to charge portable electronic gadgets - has inspired many innovative approaches. Some harness movement - via piezoelectrics - while others use blood to power implanted biofuel cells. \" our device is the first to use sweat. It's a proof of concept, \" said dr wenzhao jia of at the university of california, san diego, who gave details of her method in the journal angewandte chemie. \" at the moment the power is not that high - only four microwatts. But we are working on enhancing it so it can power small electronic devices. \" interestingly, her team did not set out to build a biobattery. Their aim was to make a wearable monitor for lactate. Athletes in training measure their lactate levels to evaluate their work-rate and fitness. But monitoring it can",

They heard rifle fire and the woman felt a flash of pain in her chest. A stray bullet had hit her — but was deflected by the underwire of her bra, leaving her with a nothing more than an ugly bruise, reports nbc news, via local paper gadebusch-rehnaer zeitung. A young wild boar's body was found in what is believed to be the line of fire, and police say it looks like the bullet hit the animal and continued on toward the woman. The hunter is being investigated for negligent injury, reports the bbc. The incident is renewing the debate over sport hunting, reports nbc, with a local agriculture minister urging people to exercise \" extreme caution in order to avoid human casualties \" as hunters often flush out wild animals into public spaces during summer harvest season. Peta, meanwhile, is renewing its call for a \" long overdue ban \" on sport hunting, with a rep saying \" when there is hunting, there is danger for every living thing nearby. \" as for a bra doubling as an accidental bullet-proof vest, this isn't the first reported incident this year. In february, a woman shopping in belem in brazil was struck by a bullet that lodged into the underwire of her black lace bra, reports fox news; she survived.

According to the washington post, lawmakers expressed concerns they wouldn't be able to have a replacement for the aca ready in the short time frame being demanded by the trump administration. They're also worried about potential damage to insurance markets, more expensive premiums, and the political consequences of defunding planned parenthood. One representative said quickly repealing the aca could \" pull the rug out from under americans \" after republicans explicitly said they wouldn't do that. The recording shows gop lawmakers realize they've backed themselves into a corner by promising that no one will lose coverage when the aca is repealed while also promising to replace it with something cheaper and without mandates or penalties. While trump wants the aca gone asap, republican lawmakers are worried about what they're going to be saddled with in 2018. One representative said republicans must be prepared to own what is sure to be known as \" trumpcare. \" in fact, barack obama told democrats before leaving office that they must make sure republicans own their health care changes and label the gop plan \" trumpcare, \" time reports.",

That's thanks to the team's army of robots, who sit in the stadium and broadcast the game to viewers at home — all while cheering for the eagles, quartz reports, via cbs sports. The fan, meanwhile, watches the game on a smartphone and controls the robot remotely. And if she wants her presence felt at the stadium, she can upload an image of her face onto the robot's head. The eagles may need the support: they've lost more than 400 games in the past five years, the bbc notes. Indeed, they're so bad that their fans — the human ones — are called \" stone buddhas, \" because they're so patient, quartz notes, via eventseeker. A british soccer fan, however, is a little worried by the devices. \" what happens if a robotic fan misbehaves? \" he asks the bbc. Perhaps a robot riot?",

Sure enough, after a secondary inspection involving an x-ray-like machine, officers popped the trunk of the car transporting lapd officer carlos curiel quezada jr., 34, and angelica godinez, 31, and found antanasio perez-avalos, 26, in the spare-tire compartment, the los angeles times reports. Trunk or not, perez-avalos \" is a mexican citizen with no legal ability to enter the united states, \" us customs officials say, per the times. Quezada and godinez were both charged with \" bringing in a person without presenting them to an appropriate immigration officer at a port of entry, \" the criminal complaint reads. \" it's a very serious act of misconduct if it's true, \" says lapd chief charlie beck, per nbc san diego. Both quezada and godinez have had their fair share of issues before. Godinez has two dui convictions, while quezada, who's been with the lapd for a decade, is on probation there after a 2014 dui charge, nbc reports. It doesn't sound like he's been smuggling tons of cash across the border: he reportedly told the judge in federal court yesterday he couldn't pay a lawyer, so the judge assigned him a public defender, per ktla 5. Quezada and godinez were out on $ 20,000 bail each by yesterday, abc 7 notes; quezada is on paid leave until the investigation ends and will be back in court april 9 for his arraignment. In the interim, his release is conditioned on him living with his parents, turning over his passport, and not being allowed to drink alcohol, ktla 5 reports.

In recent years, coachella-goers got the celebrity sightings of a lifetime when certain a-listers showed off some very un-choreographed and unrehearsed dance moves at the festival ( which, of course, were promptly recorded and uploaded to the internet for the world to see ): robert pattinson: the twilight star made headlines recently with his awkward, cigarette-smoking dance moves. Standing next to his rumored fiancée fka twigs, pattinson looked like he was having a good time while the couple watched drake perform. Kendall jenner: the kardashian sister doesn't dance so much as she sashays up and down on the grassy coachella field with her eyes closed in this video clip. Justin bieber: after bieber wouldn't stop moshing during a show, a frustrated security guard recorded footage of the singer dancing frantically and shared it online accompanied by an offensive message. Rihanna: clad in sunglasses ( at night ) and a heavy fur coat, it's easy to spot the \" umbrella \" singer smoking and grooving in this youtube video. Leonardo dicaprio: once you've seen this video of ( supposedly ) leo wildly kicking and jumping around, wearing a bandana on his face that makes him look like a bank robber, it's going to make it hard to take him seriously in his next serious oscar-contender movie role.
