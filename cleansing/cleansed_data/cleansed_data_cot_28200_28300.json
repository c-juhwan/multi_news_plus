Scientists have discovered one of the earliest examples of writing in the form of \" the world's oldest known payslip. \" dating to around 3300 bc, the clay tablet found in the mesopotamian city of uruk in modern-day iraq and now housed at the british museum — written in a picture language known as cuneiform — is just one example of how people kept records at the time, including of payments owed, per ars technica. As there was no real money, people were paid in other ways — in the case of this tablet, with beer. \" we can see a human head eating from a bowl, meaning ' ration, ' and a conical vessel, meaning ' beer.'scattered around are scratches recording the amount of beer for a particular worker, \" alison george writes at new scientist. The exchange is actually pretty normal, according to historical records. They show builders of the egyptian pyramids at giza were paid about a gallon of beer a day, while richard ii paid poet geoffrey chaucer some 252 gallons of wine per year in the middle ages. While it isn't clear how workers managed to focus on the job at hand, beer was thought of as a meal, so it was sort of like working for food. Apparently some wish we had stuck with the mesopotamian custom. It's \" a form of remuneration which seems pretty awesome when you first think about it... And then just keeps on staying awesome the longer you think about it, \" writes peter dockrill at science alert.

The former committee member calls this \" disturbing fact \" a result of the report's partisanship — only democrats participated because republicans sensed a foregone conclusion. Intel committees are supposed to stay above the partisan fray, and kerrey thinks the senate panel \" departed from that high road. \" he also faults investigators for not conducting any interviews and instead relying on documents. \" isolated emails, memos, and transcripts can look much different when there is no context or perspective provided by those who sent, received, or recorded them, \" he writes. In a wall street journal op-ed, former cia chiefs george tenet, porter goss, and michael hayden, along with former deputy directors, also criticize the lack of interviews, context, and recommendations. Was the panel afraid that interviews would not \" fit their construct? \" they also dispute the conclusion that interrogations didn't yield valuable intelligence, asserting that information from khalid sheikh mohammed prevented a 9-11-style attack on the west coast. And despite what the report says, the interrogation program was \" essential \" in the capture of osama bin laden. \" when oversight works well, it is balanced, constructively critical, and discreet — and offers sound recommendations, \" they write. \" the senate intelligence committee's report is disrespectful of that standard. \" click for the full column, or for kerrey's full column.",

Here are the details, as reported by ars technica, gizmodo, the washington post, and marketwatch: 3d \" dynamic perspective \": the phone can create a glasses-free 3d effect. Four front-facing cameras will track users ' heads and adjust the display as they move; that would allow you to look around and under various on-screen features. If you're looking at info overlayed on a map, for example, you could tilt the phone to look under that layer. Firefly: the phone has the built-in capability to recognize millions of objects, songs, and even specific episodes of tv shows, using photos and sound. This can both give you information about them — like, say, which actors are in a show — and, of course, help you buy the item from amazon. There's a dedicated button for firefly on the phone, and developers will be able make apps using it. Price: based on an at&t product page, the phone will start at $ 200 with a two-year contract for the 32gb model, or $ 300 for the 64gb. Mayday: the phone will also boast amazon's much-lauded on-screen tech support option mayday. Push a button, and a specialist should appear on your phone in less than 10 seconds. The specs: the phone will have a 4.7-inch hd display, a quad-core 2.2ghz processor, and 2gb of ram — all of which are respectable, though there are bigger and faster phones out there.

Dylan davies, using the pseudonym morgan jones, criticized the compound's defenses, amidst an action-packed account in which he raced to the consulate, climbed a 12-foot-wall, and knocked an extremist out with the butt of his gun. He's put out a book with the same story, published by simon and schuster — which is owned by cbs. But when the fbi interviewed him, davies said he'd sat out the attack, instead remaining at the villa where he lived, the new york times revealed last night. That interview is \" completely consistent \" with the incident report davies filed with blue mountain, the security contractor he worked for. That incident report was leaked to the washington post last week, but davies called it a lie put out by the \" big people \" he was upsetting, and cbs stood by him. Now, though, the network appears to have taken down the video, and says it may yank the book as well.",

            "Hundreds of israeli tourists returned home on wednesday after israel issued an urgent travel warning its citizens to leave egypt's sinai peninsula due to a kidnapping alert, police said. The counter-terrorism bureau issued a strongly worded statement late tuesday, saying: \" we call on all israelis in sinai to return to israel immediately. Families of israelis in sinai are requested to contact them and inform them of this travel warning. \" t advertisement he head of the counter-terrorism bureau in the prime minister's office, nitzan nuriel, told haaretz there was intelligence information about immediate plans to abduct an israeli to gaza. The organizations planning the abduction are thought to be working under hamas instruction and funding, he said. The peninsula, within driving distance of israel, was once an extremely popular vacation destination for israelis because of its inexpensive seaside resorts, nestled at the foot of desert mountains. But a string of deadly suicide bombings in 2004 at several vacation spots popular with israelis - including the taba hilton hotel just across the israeli border - has led many israelis to shun the sinai peninsula, though the area still remains relatively popular. Police spokesman micky rosenfeld said that about 650 israelis were in sinai when the warning was issued tuesday - about half the number the initially estimated by counterterrorism officials. By midmorning wednesday, some 430 had returned, rosenfeld said. Nuriel said this was probably the most serious alert in recent months. Egyptian security forces also launched an intensive effort to undermine the kidnapping, and sharply increased their contingents in popular sinai resorts. A year ago, 50 terror suspects with alleged hezbollah ties were arrested in sinai. The suspects were allegedly planning terror attacks on israeli tourists. Despite the bureau's earlier travel warning just before passover, thousands of israelis spent the holiday in sinai. The israel airports authority reported that departures to sinai were up 36 per cent compared with last year. Another 69,000 people passed through the taba crossing over passover. A source in the bureau said it was \" regrettable that people ignore warnings and keep traveling to sinai \". In sinai, the owner of a beach and restaurant resort told haaretz his business was packed with israelis throughout the holiday. On tuesday, an ordinary weekday, he had 10 israeli couples staying at his resort. \" people heard about the new warning, but no one left, \" he said. \" the israelis don't listen to the warnings.

            "Hundreds of israeli tourists returned home on wednesday after israel issued an urgent travel warning its citizens to leave egypt's sinai peninsula due to a kidnapping alert, police said. The counter-terrorism bureau issued a strongly worded statement late tuesday, saying: \" we call on all israelis in sinai to return to israel immediately. Families of israelis in sinai are requested to contact them and inform them of this travel warning. \" t advertisement he head of the counter-terrorism bureau in the prime minister's office, nitzan nuriel, told haaretz there was intelligence information about immediate plans to abduct an israeli to gaza. The organizations planning the abduction are thought to be working under hamas instruction and funding, he said. The peninsula, within driving distance of israel, was once an extremely popular vacation destination for israelis because of its inexpensive seaside resorts, nestled at the foot of desert mountains. But a string of deadly suicide bombings in 2004 at several vacation spots popular with israelis - including the taba hilton hotel just across the israeli border - has led many israelis to shun the sinai peninsula, though the area still remains relatively popular. Police spokesman micky rosenfeld said that about 650 israelis were in sinai when the warning was issued tuesday - about half the number the initially estimated by counterterrorism officials. By midmorning wednesday, some 430 had returned, rosenfeld said. Nuriel said this was probably the most serious alert in recent months. Egyptian security forces also launched an intensive effort to undermine the kidnapping, and sharply increased their contingents in popular sinai resorts. A year ago, 50 terror suspects with alleged hezbollah ties were arrested in sinai. The suspects were allegedly planning terror attacks on israeli tourists. Despite the bureau's earlier travel warning just before passover, thousands of israelis spent the holiday in sinai. The israel airports authority reported that departures to sinai were up 36 per cent compared with last year. Another 69,000 people passed through the taba crossing over passover. A source in the bureau said it was \" regrettable that people ignore warnings and keep traveling to sinai \". In sinai, the owner of a beach and restaurant resort told haaretz his business was packed with israelis throughout the holiday. On tuesday, an ordinary weekday, he had 10 israeli couples staying at his resort. \" people heard about the new warning, but no one left, \" he said. \" the israelis don't listen to the warnings. They've been driven nuts for years now with alerts about how"

Credit and debit card processor global payments has been hit by a security breach that has put some 50,000 cardholders at risk, andrew johnson reports on lunch break. Photo: bloomberg news. The breach at global payments inc. Is the latest in a wave of data attacks that have heightened consumer concerns about identity theft. The card industry has been particularly vulnerable to those concerns amid a slew of big breaches in recent years as more americans choose to pay with plastic rather than cash. The extent of the breach couldn't be determined and it wasn't immediately clear if cardholders have seen fraudulent transactions. Consumers typically aren't liable for unauthorized purchases made on their cards. The company declined to say how many cards were at risk, but people familiar with the investigation estimated that it could be hundreds of thousands. The company said it \" identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a portion of its processing system. \" it added that in early march it \" determined that card data may have been accessed. \" global payments didn't disclose what type of data had been accessed, but said it had notified \" appropriate industry parties to allow them to minimize"

So says the ap and new york times, who separately report that obama strategists are so struck by the similarities between bush's campaign against john kerry and the 2012 race that they are borrowing from bush's political playbook. For one thing: the white house already is attacking mitt romney as a massachusetts flip-flopper, much as bush did to kerry. \" politics is infused with rich ironies, \" says mark mckinnon, bush's media strategist back then. Like team bush, team obama intends to prove the political adage that an election usually boils down to a choice between two individuals instead of being a referendum on policy, writes richard w. Stevenson in the times. Not that policy doesn't matter: bush in some ways turned the iraqi war to his advantage with the message that he made politically unpopular decisions to keep the country safe.

Or to break the question into its most important component parts: can mr. Obama overcome the bad economy, and perhaps even turn it to his advantage in certain ways, in the same way president george w. Bush overcame and in a sense turned to his advantage the bloody, expensive and increasingly unpopular war in iraq eight years ago? and can mr. Obama do to his opponent – for now let's say mitt romney – what mr. Bush did to senator john kerry in 2004? the parallels are sufficient enough that mr. Obama and his team have studied, and to a striking degree are replicating, the bush re-election playbook. Already they are building a narrative in which mr. Obama made politically brave decisions to do what was right for the economy, even if those decisions were unpopular. It's a theme that echoes mr. Bush's argument in 2004 that he did what it took to keep the country safe, and that even if you disagreed",

But president obama's chances of re-election could come down to a single strategic question: to what degree can the history of 2004 be repeated in 2012? on politics the times's political editor on 2012. Or to break the question into its most important component parts: can mr. Obama overcome the bad economy, and perhaps even turn it to his advantage in certain ways, in the same way president george w. Bush overcame and in a sense turned to his advantage the bloody, expensive and increasingly unpopular war in iraq eight years ago? and can mr. Obama do to his opponent – for now let's say mitt romney – what mr. Bush did to senator john kerry in 2004? the parallels are sufficient enough that mr. Obama and his team have studied, and to a striking degree are replicating, the bush re-election playbook. Already they are building a narrative in which mr. Obama made politically brave decisions to do what was right for the economy, even if those decisions were unpopular. It's a theme that echoes mr. Bush's argument in 2004 that he did what it took to keep the country safe, and that even if you disagreed",

The three-time olympic medalist and five-time world champ was 37. \" the only reason why the usa is in any conversation in... Bobsled is because of steve holcomb, \" said pilot nick cunningham, who roomed next to holcomb in lake placid. \" he was the face of our sport. Every driver in the world watched him, because he was that good at what he did. \" no cause of death was immediately announced. However, there were no indications of foul play and usa bobsled said it was believed holcomb died in his sleep. An autopsy is set for sunday. Holcomb's signature moment came at the 2010 vancouver games when he piloted his four-man sled to a win that snapped a 62-year gold-medal drought for the us. Holcomb also drove to bronze medals in both two- and four-man events at the 2014 sochi games, and was to be part of the 2018 olympic team. \" steve was a tremendous athlete and even better person, \" us olympic committee ceo scott blackmun said. Holcomb was cherubic, almost always happy in public, and teammates spent a season chronicling his \" holcy dance, \" a less-than-rhythmic shuffle. His agent tells usa today he recently spent a week with him. \" everything was cool, \" he said. \" he told me with the world championships being in whistler in 2019, that would be his swan song. \" ( holcomb once took lolo jones to task. )",

            "Outgoing speaker of the house john boehner ( r-ohio ) expressed optimism about a pending bipartisan agreement on the federal budget at a news conference oct. 27. ( ap ) congressional leaders worked late into the night on tuesday to resolve last-minute issues with the bipartisan budget agreement reached between congressional leaders and the white house, paving the way for the house to vote as early as wednesday on the legislation. The deal hit a snag tuesday night after many republicans raised questions about whether the $ 80 billion in spending increases in the legislation would be fully offset by spending cuts and other revenue. Conservatives continued to fight the bill throughout the night, including attempting to kill the bill in a late-night hearing of the house rules committee. But republican leaders worked out last-minute fixes and the committee voted to clear the bill, setting up a possible wednesday floor vote. Some republicans raised concerns that the bill only includes about $ 75.7 billion in spending cuts, according to the congressional budget office, about $ 4 billion short of the $ 80 billion in spending increases. Congressional leaders amended the deal late tuesday to resolve the discrepancy. Boehner spokeswoman emily schillinger said the amendment included a \"technical fix \" to off-budget money, known as the overseas contingency operations fund, that was used to help offset some spending. \"with this amendment, all budget cap relief"

The victims include at least 21 children and four adults killed in the collapse of the enrique rabsamen primary school in mexico city's coapa neighborhood, the guardian reports. On tuesday evening, mexican president enrique pena nieto visited the site, where rescuers occasionally paused their search to listen for voices in the rubble, the ap reports. The president said at least 30 children and eight adults are still missing. In a video message released later tuesday, pena nieto urged mexicans to stay calm. \" the priority at this moment is to keep rescuing people who are still trapped and to give medical attention to the injured people, \" he said. Civilian volunteers have joined rescue workers at many sites. Authorities say the quake collapsed at least 44 buildings in mexico city alone, the telegraph reports. It hit on the anniversary of a 1985 earthquake that killed thousands. Earlier in the day, workplaces and schools across mexico city had marked the date by holding earthquake readiness drills. The us geological survey says the quake hit at 1: 14pm with an epicenter in puebla state, about 76 miles southeast of mexico city",

Dozens of buildings tumbled into mounds of rubble or were severely damaged in densely populated parts of mexico city and nearby states.

        "summary": "A single can of an energy drink packs quite a wallop, causing potentially worrisome spikes in blood pressure and in a stress hormone that's a cousin to adrenaline, say researchers at the mayo clinic. Reporting in the journal jama, the mayo team recruited 25 healthy adults for the study and measured the volunteers ' blood pressure, heart rate, and levels of caffeine, glucose, and the hormone norepinephrine in their bloodstream before and after ingesting the energy drink rockstar. They simultaneously tested a placebo that looked and tasted similar but lacked the caffeine and stimulants such as taurine and milk thistle extract found in the energy drink, the researchers report in a press release. While heart rate didn't change significantly after a person drank one serving of rockstar, average blood pressure increased by 6.4 %, while average norepinephrine levels went up 31 % after taking the placebo versus 74 % after downing the energy drink. \" these acute hemodynamic and adrenergic changes may predispose to increased cardiovascular risk, \" they write. The same group had earlier this year found that energy drinks can raise blood pressure to potentially unhealthy levels, reports live science, though they warn that larger studies will be required to confirm this study's results because the sample size is so small and involved just one type of energy drink. ( little evidence backs up the claim by energy drink makers that ingredients other than caffeine increase energy levels. )",

        "summary": "The pilot of the plane that crashed in colombia on monday while carrying a brazilian soccer team made a fateful decision not to stop to refuel the aircraft, according to a report in a brazilian newspaper. The account in o globo says pilot miguel quiroga chose not to stop en route in bogota, about 260 miles from his destination, reports the bbc. He did so despite being warned that he might run out of fuel before he took off from santa cruz, bolivia, according to the bolivian newspaper deber. The risk seemed clear given that the maximum range of his avro rj85 plane is roughly equivalent to the total distance of the flight from santa cruz to medellin. The plane might have made it if not for one thing: quiroga was ordered to circle near the medellin airport for seven minutes because another plane needed to make an emergency landing, reports reuters. Quiroga, perhaps not realizing the situation was so dire, did not immediately signal an emergency, reports ap. But soon he radioed that he was out of fuel and experiencing electrical failure, and by then it was too late. The air traffic controller who handled the call has since received death threats. \" i did all that was humanly possible and technically necessary to preserve the lives of the passengers, \" she wrote in a letter to colleagues. \" unfortunately my efforts weren't enough. \" international flights are supposed to carry enough fuel for an additional 30 minutes of flight time, and authorities continue to investigate. In the meantime, bolivia has suspended the charter of the small airline that operated the flight.",

        "summary": "Until now, scientists have measured ice thickness using satellite images, visual estimates, and by drilling holes in the ice itself. But in antarctica, much of the floating ice is actually underwater, with ice so thick that drilling and satellite images just don't work. For the past four years, a team of researchers from the us, uk, and australia have been deploying an autonomous underwater vehicle they call seabed to explore areas that divers and other machinery can't reach and, using sonar, measure the ice's thickness from the bottom looking up, reports upi. They're now reporting in the journal nature geoscience that, while a lot of ice remains to be measured, they've been surprised to find ice as thick as 65 feet. Because most of the ice in antarctica melts away during the summer months, scientists had long assumed it wouldn't be terribly thick — previous research has indicated it's usually 3 to 6 feet thick, and in some places as many as 16 feet thick, reports livescience. But what they've found thus far has averaged 4.6 to 18 feet, with measurements maxing out at 65 feet in the bellingshausen sea. Sea ice has actually been growing in antarctica by 1.2 % to 1.8 % a year since 1979, though the increases are mainly in the ross sea ( it's decreased significantly in the bellingshausen and amundsen seas ), adds livescience. Scientists say these regional differences are likely due to stronger winds or more meltwater from the antarctic ice sheet. ( see a few more theories about the increasing ice. )",

Her claim that president obama stated stimulus legislation would prevent unemployment from rising above 8 %: long story short, he never said that. She's referring to a projection, which was not even an official government assessment, issued by two aides before obama took office. And she got the stimulus amount wrong, to boot, referring to it as $ 1 trillion when it was actually $ 800 billion.

Two years later, the 71-year-old louisiana man is still waiting for a parole hearing that could set him free. The ap reports thursday marks the two-year anniversary of the supreme court's ruling in montgomery's favor. The decision enabled roughly 2,000 inmates to argue for their release after receiving mandatory life-without-parole sentences as juveniles. The court determined in 2012 the sentences are unconstitutional \" cruel and unusual \" punishment, and in the case of montgomery v. Louisiana in 2016 decided the ruling should apply retroactively. Montgomery was 17 when he killed a sheriff's deputy in 1963. The decision ushered in a wave of new sentences and the release of inmates from michigan to pennsylvania, arkansas, and beyond. But other former teen offenders are still waiting for a chance at resentencing in states and counties that have been slow to address the court ruling, an ap investigation found. In michigan, for example, prosecutors are seeking new no-parole sentences for nearly two-thirds of 363 juvenile lifers. The state judge who resentenced montgomery to life with the possibility of parole said in june that he's a \" model prisoner \" who appears to be rehabilitated, but while louisiana's parole board was scheduled to hear montgomery's case on dec. 14, the hearing has been postponed until feb. 19.",

Supreme court's ruling in montgomery's favor. The decision enabled roughly 2,000 inmates to argue for their release after receiving mandatory life-without-parole sentences as juveniles. Louisiana's parole board was scheduled to hear montgomery's case on dec. 14 but postponed the hearing until feb. 19. Montgomery was 17 when he killed a sheriff's deputy in 1963. The supreme court decided in 2012 that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles are unconstitutional \" cruel and unusual \" punishment. The justices made their decision retroactive in montgomery's case. The decision ushered in a wave of new sentences and the release of inmates from michigan to pennsylvania, arkansas and beyond.

According to the ap, 32-year-old kenneth gadson told japanese police where they could find the woman's body. Rina shimbukuro had been missing since last week. The former marine allegedly admitted to strangling shimbukuro, but his attorney tells stars and stripes the confession was given while gadson was \" still in a daze \" following multiple suicide attempts. The attorney says gadson tried to kill himself with sleeping pills on tuesday and again on wednesday. Gadson has been charged with illegally disposing of shimbukuro's body but not with the murder. Police don't believe the two knew each other and are still looking for a motive. Tension was already high between the us military and the japenese in okinawa, where reuters reports us military installations take up about 18 % of the space, before gadson's arrest. Okinawa's governor says he's \" outraged \" by shimbukuro's murder. On saturday, us defense secretary ash carter called japan's defense minister to offer \" apologies \" and \" sympathies. \" the us defense department states it will cooperate with japanese authorities in the case and do whatever it can to keep something like this from happening again.

The snl 40 special featured appearances from current and former cast members, film icons, and musical guests like paul mccartney and kanye west. But despite great moments, the show wasn't free of oddities. Among the high- and lowlights of the 3.5-hour show: jimmy fallon and justin timberlake opened the whole shebang with a rap celebrating 40 years of sketches, mediaite reports. The pair dropped references to classics, recalling wild and crazy guys, the blues brothers, and more cowbell. They were joined by snl alums rachel dratch and molly shannon. Mike myers and dana carvey brought wayne's world back to life with a top-10 list, reports the hollywood reporter. They took the opportunity to poke fun at kanye's mic-grabbing moments and even mock show boss lorne michaels: \" what can we say about lorne michaels that he has not already said about himself? \" weekend update reached across the decades, uniting tina fey and amy poehler with jane curtin at the desk. The three hosted melissa mccarthy, emma stone, and edward norton in the segment featuring a collection of beloved characters, vulture reports. Eddie murphy returned to the show for the first time since he was a cast member, having refused hosting opportunities in the past. Murphy got a standing ovation, but instead of reprising any roles, he just made some quick remarks, repeating himself after an odd pause; it wasn't clear what had been planned for the moment, the hollywood reporter notes. Paul mccartney and paul simon offered a quick duet version of \" i've just seen a face, \" and mccartney later tore into \" maybe i ' m amazed, \" rolling stone reports. Miley cyrus sang simon's \" 50 ways to leave your lover \" alongside former cast member fred armisen, and simon himself played \" still crazy after all these years \" at the show's end.

        "summary": "A chemical found in most antibacterial soaps may be fighting off germs at the cost of causing liver damage. There have been question marks around triclosan for some time — the fda warned last year that antibacterial soap could be harmful, and minnesota banned the ingredient this year — but new research finds it could be a lot more dangerous than thought, the atlantic reports. The study linked the chemical to liver damage and tumors in mice, the independent reports, and though it wasn't found to actually cause cancer, the changes observed in the mice's bodies \" resemble the environment within which human liver cancer forms, \" the researchers say. Triclosan is found in around 75 % of germ-killing soaps, as well as in products like floor waxes, toothpaste, and cosmetics. The study, published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences journal, says triclosan — which some manufacturers have already started to phase out — appeared to make the mice more susceptible to liver disease, and promoted the growth of tumors once they appeared. Researchers say the chemical is of concern because it is so prevalent and suggest many of its uses should be eliminated. Exposure could be limited by removing triclosan from uses of \" high volume, but of low benefit, \" like hand soap, a study co-author says, while retaining \" uses shown to have health value — as in toothpaste, where the amount used is small. \" ( the fda took 40 years to consider the use of triclosan, leading to calls to completely change how we regulate chemicals. )",

The research is the latest to link triclosan with cancer and liver disease, but other scientists have urged caution over the findings suggesting that they do not prove a direct causal link between the chemical and the ill health of people exposed to it.

Du pont de nemours ( known as dupont ) apparently let go of workers — by getting them to join a wholly owned subsidiary and then selling it off. A lawsuit by ex-employees claims dupont was secretly negotiating the sale at the same time it promised to keep the subsidiary. Koch industries soon bought it and reduced the workers'retirement plans and salaries. \" the texas supreme court sees no problem with any of this, \" says main street. Why not? because these are \" at-will \" employees who can legally be dismissed anytime for whatever reason, without warning. Per the high court, that justified any lies about dupont workers ' future employment. Note that the alleged scheme saved dupont money, for the workers ( many of whom were unionized ) would have transferred within the company if they knew the subsidiary's real future. That would have cost dupont in retraining and rehiring to replace them; even laying them off would have cost money, lexology notes. The high court's ruling — that at-will workers can't bring a fraud claim over job loss — returns the case to the fifth circuit court of appeals for \" a final analysis, \" says lexology.

        "summary": "In a development that will alarm florida tourist authorities as well as pregnant women, sources tell multiple news outlets that mosquitoes are spreading zika in miami beach. A health official tells the new york times that a cluster of cases probably spread by mosquitoes has been found in the city, which is separated by water from miami itself. The official says authorities are considering telling pregnant women to avoid the area — and possibly all of miami-dade county. So far, the state health department says only that two new non-travel-related cases have been detected outside the 1-square-mile \" zika zone \" in miami's wynwood neighborhood where the first mosquito transmissions of the virus in the us have been detected, the miami herald reports. Miami beach's city manager told commissioners that the two cases are a tourist who visited about two weeks ago and a resident, according to an email obtained by nbc 6. Mayor philip levine, however, told reporters thursday night that there is no cluster of cases. \" there is no epidemic, there is no outbreak of zika on miami beach, there are two unconfirmed cases, the county says and the health department says, but they have not been confirmed for miami beach, \" he said, adding that the city has stepped up its war on mosquitoes. \" i can tell you this, i wouldn't want to be a mosquito on miami beach, \" he said.

Reuters reports a person recently reached out to the cardinal in charge of st peter's basilica, and a vatican rep says that cardinal was offered the documents for \" a certain price. \" in an interview with vatican radio, a vatican spokesman confirmed the theft — which had not been public before yesterday — and said a second letter bearing michelangelo's signature had also been stolen.

        "summary": "The ruling law and justice party ( pis ) in poland is trying to fundamentally alter the nation's court system with a spate of new bills that would give the government the power to force out the nation's top judges and replace them with those appointed by parliament — where the pis has a slim majority. Just how radical are the changes? if they go through, the european union says poland may no longer qualify as a democracy, reports the new york times. The laws \" would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government, \" says a vp of the european commission. Related coverage: what's next: the bills are expected to sail through the pis-controlled senate and land on the desk of president andrzej duda, reports the ap. In a surprise move, however, politico reports that duda wants to water down the measures before approving them. The rationale: pis chief jaroslaw kaczynski, seen as poland's \" de facto leader \" by the economist, says the reforms are needed because the courts are \" subordinated to foreign forces \" and also too inefficient. But critics say the pis is looking to put into place a judicial rubber-stamp for its policies. ' nuclear option ': because of the moves, the eu is close to triggering its never-before-used article 7 against poland. The so-called \" nuclear option \" could lead to the suspension of poland's voting rights, reports the guardian, though such a move requires the unanimous consent of member nations, and hungary is unlikely to go along. The danger: a court system run by the government \" could enable the government to falsify elections, to evade corruption investigations, to prosecute opponents, \" writes anne applebaum in a washington post column. Getting personal: in fiery debate in parliament, an opposition member said that former president lech kaczynski — the late brother of the current pis leader — would never have approved of such changes. \" don't wipe your treacherous mugs with the name of my late brother, \" jaroslaw kaczynski shot back. \" you destroyed him, you murdered him, you are scoundrels. \" his brother was killed in a suspicious 2010 plane crash. That prompted another lawmaker to describe kaczynski as \" crazy with hate. \"",

            "It's been weeks since a family-friendly film hit theaters, and judging by the opening weekend result for \" cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2, \" moviegoers with kids were eager to return to the multiplex. The 3-d animated sequel easily beat out three new nationwide releases this weekend, launching with $ 35 million, according to an estimate from distributor sony pictures. Though that's a solid opening, it's still far below the $ 45 million pre-release audience surveys indicated for the film. None of the weekend's other new films did especially impressive business. Ron howard's race car drama \" rush \" didn't get off to that speedy a start, taking in $ 10.3 million. The romantic comedy \" baggage claim \" grossed $ 9.3 million, barely beating the $ 9-million tally for joseph gordon-levitt's directorial debut \" don jon \" — though both films were made for under $ 10 million. Photos: billion-dollar movie club \" cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2 \" had a slightly bigger opening than its predecessor, which debuted with $ 30.3 million in 2009. The picture went on to collect a healthy $ 243 million worldwide. Like the original \" cloudy, \" the sequel was well-liked by audiences: both installments received an average grade of a-, according to market research firm",

So why the break-in, in a country that's already struggling to contain ebola? reports vary, but the people were likely unhappy about having the center in their area, didn't like patients being brought in from other neighborhoods, or wanted the center closed because they consider ebola a hoax, the bbc reports. \" this is one of the stupidest things i have ever seen in my life, \" said a police officer.

It seems that one group in particular, called turla, puts comments on her instagram posts that seem like spam but are actually a kind of hidden code that provide instructions for its malware, reports security company eset. As engadget explains, it is clever but complicated, but it doesn't mean that browsing britney's instagram will infect your computer. In the example cited by eset, the since-deleted comment on this photo supposedly came from asmith2155 and read, \" #2 hot make loved to her, uupss #hot #x. \" that comment, however, was actually an encrypted message that, once deciphered, helps infected systems communicate with the turla mothership. In this case, the actual malware was in a firefox browser extension masquerading as a security feature. But once in place, that malware needs to communicate with its \" command and control \" server to get instructions on what to do and how to send stolen data. A post at boing boing takes it from there: \" turla moves the c&c server around, then hides the current address of the server in encrypted comments left on britney spears's image posts, \" it explains. \" the compromised systems check in with spears's instagram whenever they need to know where the c&c server is currently residing. \" in the constantly evolving cat-and-mouse game between hackers and security systems, it's a safe bet the strategy already has changed.

The tale is a convoluted one, and it involves one of mueller's most vocal critics on the right, a self-identified lobbyist named jack burkman, reports cnbc. Multiple journalists told mueller's office that they had been approached by a woman who said burkman offered her about $ 20,000 \"to make accusations of sexual misconduct and workplace harassment against robert mueller, \" according to her email to them, obtained by the atlantic. The woman, who had previously worked for mueller as a paralegal in the 1970s, said she had been approached by a man \" with a british accent \" making the offer on burkman's behalf. Burkman, for his part, denies knowing the woman who sent the email to journalists. However, in a tweet, he promised to reveal the name of a woman thursday who is a sex-assault victim of mueller. A spokesman for mueller says the claims are false. \" it's just a stupid hoax, \" tweeted journalist jane mayer of the new yorker, who worked on the brett kavanaugh and eric schneiderman stories with ronan farrow. Burkman is no stranger to conspiracy theories: the hill notes that he conducted his own investigation into the death of democratic national committee staffer seth rich, only to have rich's parents distance themselves from him, and the washington times reported that he offered $ 25,000 earlier this year to anyone who could prove criminal wrongdoing related to mueller's inquiry.

From taxes to minimum wage to gun control, a broad range of changes is coming at the state level as americans ring in 2017. And, as has been the trend lately, the new year will bring far broader legalization of marijuana. It's what the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws, in a letter to vice president-elect mike pence arguing against pot prohibitions, called an \"unprecedented schism between state and federal law in regards to … cannabis statutes. \" while that debate will play out anew as the trump administration takes office with a law-and-order mandate, the \"schism \" grows wider in 2017. Already, revelers in massachusetts and california will have the legal option of pairing their new year's eve champagne with a joint. Approved by voters in november, legal recreational pot use took effect on dec. 15 in massachusetts; legal personal use of the drug took effect in california shortly after voters approved it there, though retail sales are still months away from implementation. Nevada legalized recreational pot on jan. 1, and maine will follow soon after. Voters in the last election approved legalizing the drug for medical purposes in north dakota, montana, florida and arkansas. In colorado, one of the first states to legalize pot, licensed medical marijuana growers will now be allowed to sell pot as well. Colorado voters also backed an increase in the statewide minimum wage.

        "summary": "A coroner in ohio has confirmed the country's first fatal drug overdoses caused by carfentanil — an animal tranquilizer so powerful that a dose smaller than a snowflake can kill a human. The cases come from hamilton county, an area including cincinnati, which has recorded more than 200 overdoses and three deaths in the last two weeks. About 40 overdoses per month were reported in the second half of 2015, compared to 92 per month in the first half of this year, reports the new york times. Officials say users often don't know they're taking carfentanil — smuggled into the us from mexico or china and used to cut heroin — which offers a more powerful and longer-lasting high than other opioids. Its strength means users need two or more doses of antidote naloxone to combat an overdose, reports npr, though one sheriff describes naloxone as \" ineffective \" against carfentanil or fentanyl. \" instead of having four or five overdoses in a day, you're having these 20, 30, 40, maybe even 50 overdoses in a day, \" says a rep for the county's heroin coalition task force. \" to me, that's just like pulling a gun out and shooting someone, because you know that a tiny bit can kill a person, \" he adds. \" it's murder. \" a mixture of heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil was found during a recent traffic stop in cincinnati, reports wcpo. Officials say carfentanil may also be in use in indiana, kentucky, florida, and west virginia.",

        "summary": "For more than three decades, china has enforced a one-child policy meant to tamp down on population growth. Today marks a big change. Per the official xinhua news agency, china's communist party has replaced the one-child policy with a two-child policy, meaning any couple in china can have two children if they choose, reports the bbc. How exactly the change might transform the country isn't yet clear. The bbc reports as many as 90 % of couples already eligible to have a second child under a law relaxed in 2013 — which eliminates the rule if the mother or father is an only child — haven't had a second, meaning the government's hope of boosting births by 2 million per year wasn't met. Still, president xi jinping hopes the latest change will help create more \" balanced growth, \" as bloomberg puts it. The change comes after a secretive gathering of the communist party central committee that focused on drawing up the country's next five-year plan. The ap observes that \" in recent years, it has been unusual for such plenary sessions to result in major decisions. \" but 30 % of the population is now over 50, and with so few children around, half of primary and secondary schools have closed in china over the last 15 years. Overall, it's believed that the one-child policy has prevented some 400 million births — including through forced abortions — since it was adopted nationally in 1979. \" i did fall pregnant a second time, but i had an abortion, \" a grandmother tells the bbc. \" you either go willingly or the government comes for you. \"",

The lights dimmed when bellis, a 17-year-old californian, made her entrance. She got a warm reception. She unpacked her tennis bag and got ready for the biggest stage of her life. Bellis, whose given name is catherine, provided one of the more intriguing subplots during the first week of the united states open, owing to her youth, her status as an amateur and her american citizenship. Her penchant for hammering strokes from the baseline was also endearing. The crowd roared whenever she roped a winner. Unfortunately for her, highlights were few and far between against an opponent as fearsome as angelique kerber, the second seed and one of the championship favorites. Kerber rolled past bellis, 6-1, 6-1, in 55 minutes",

That result made the californian an overnight sensation and prompted fans to queue for hours for her second-round match, where a charmed run that had started in qualifying ended in three sets. This time bellis, still not old enough to vote in the november election, will stick around a bit longer after fighting back from a set down on wednesday evening for a 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 win over countrywoman shelby rogers to reach the third round at flushing meadows.

            "Photo cici bellis was the youngest player left in the women's draw when she arrived friday night for her third-round match at arthur ashe stadium. The lights dimmed when bellis, a 17-year-old californian, made her entrance. She got a warm reception. She unpacked her tennis bag and got ready for the biggest stage of her life. Bellis, whose given name is catherine, provided one of the more intriguing subplots during the first week of the united states open, owing to her youth, her status as an amateur and her american citizenship. Her penchant for hammering strokes from the baseline was also endearing. The crowd roared whenever she roped a winner. Unfortunately for her, highlights were few and far between against an opponent as fearsome as angelique kerber, the second seed and one of the championship favorites. Kerber rolled past bellis, 6-1, 6-1, in 55 minutes",
            "It's been two years since a 15-year-old unknown named catherine cartan 'cici ' bellis stunned 12th-seeded dominika cibulkova to become the youngest girl in nearly two decades to make it past the first round at the us open. That result made the californian an overnight sensation and prompted fans to queue for hours for her second-round match, where a charmed run that had started in qualifying ended in three sets. This time bellis, still not old enough to vote in the november election, will stick around a bit longer after fighting back from a set down on wednesday evening for a 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 win over countrywoman shelby rogers to reach the third round at flushing meadows. The teenager stood slack-jawed at the baseline when her opponent netted a forehand on match point, then jumped twice for joy after shaking hands with rogers and the chair umpire. Ryan harrison shocks wimbledon runner-up milos raonic",
            "If cici bellis ' charmed us open run suggested a player ready to compete at the tour level, then friday night's one-sided defeat to the world's second-best player showed just how far the teenager from silicon valley has to go. The 17-year-old amateur's storybook march through qualifying into the third round came to a screeching halt in arthur ashe stadium against germany's angelique kerber, who needed less than an hour to win 6-1, 6-1 and book a date in the last 16 opposite petra kvitova, who won earlier on friday.

The guidelines, published in the annals of internal medicine journal, instead advise to first try exercise, massages, heat therapy, acupuncture — even something called \" spinal manipulation, \" which is controlled force applied to a joint in the spine by an experienced health care professional. Even more holistic approaches ( including yoga, tai chi, and meditation ) are encouraged over opioids for long-term aches. Dr. Steven atlas, who wrote an accompanying editorial for the new guidelines, says they \" may be a shot across the bow to insurers \" to provide more coverage for these \" alternative \" treatments, per cbs. Not that the group is averse to all medications: it says anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and naproxen can provide relief, though acetaminophen hasn't been shown to be terribly effective. The main goal is to keep people away from drugs that can get them hooked. \" opioids should be considered only if no other treatments work and only if there are more benefits than risks for an individual patient, \" the journal writeup notes.

        "summary": "Heinz brought in a former ceo of burger king to run the ship a few months ago — and now mcdonald's has severed ties with the ketchup company after 40 years, reports the pittsburgh post-gazette. That means nobody eating at mcdonald's will be slathering their fries with a heinz product, although the newspaper points out that the vast majority of americans won't notice. Only two us markets in the chain — pittsburgh ( where heinz is based ) and minneapolis — were using heinz ketchup anyway. Mcdonald's did serve heinz in overseas stores, and that's where the move will likely sting. \" as a result of recent management changes at heinz, we have decided to transition our business to other suppliers over time, \" says a mcdonald's statement. As for burger king, it remains a loyal heinz customer and uses its products in about 80 % of all its stores, reports reuters.",

Heinz co, since that company is now led by bernardo hees, the former chief executive of hamburger rival burger king worldwide inc bkw.n. \" as a result of recent management changes at heinz, we have decided to transition our business to other suppliers over time, \" mcdonald's said in a statement. \" we have spoken to heinz and plan to work together to ensure a smooth and orderly transition, \" said mcdonald's, which has more than 34,000 restaurants around the globe. Heinz declined to comment. \" as a matter of policy, heinz does not comment on relationships with customers, \" company spokesman michael mullen said.

The move from mcdonald's could benefit heinz ketchup rivals hunt's, owned by conagra foods inc ( cag.n ), and del monte.

        "summary": "Scholastic is pulling a new picture book about george washington and his slaves amid objections it sentimentalizes a brutal part of american history. A birthday cake for george washington was released jan. 5 and had been strongly criticized for its upbeat images and story of washington's cook ( the slave hercules ) and his daughter, delia. Its withdrawal was announced sunday. Notes in the book — which depicts hercules and delia preparing a cake for washington — from author ramin ganeshram and illustrator vanessa brantley-newton pointed out the historical context of the 18th-century story and that hercules eventually escaped, and in a jan. 6 scholastic blog post, ganeshram wrote that the story was based on historical research and meant to honor the slaves'skill and resourcefulness. Some critics, however, faulted ganeshram ( born to a trinidadian father and iranian mother ) and brantley-newton ( self-described as being from a \" blended background \" ) for leaving out those details from the main narrative. \" oh, how george washington loves his cake! \" reads the publisher's description. \" and, oh, how he depends on hercules, his head chef, to make it for him. Hercules, a slave, takes great pride in baking the president's cake. But this year there is one problem — they are out of sugar. \" the book has received more than 100 one-star reviews on amazon and also set off discussions on social media. The trade publication school library journal had called it \" highly problematic \" and recommended against its purchase; another trade journal, kirkus reviews, had labeled the book \" an incomplete, even dishonest treatment of slavery. \" \" while we have great respect for the integrity and scholarship of the author, illustrator, and editor, we believe that, without more historical background on the evils of slavery than this book for younger children can provide, the book may give a false impression of the reality of the lives of slaves and therefore should be withdrawn, \" the publisher said in a statement.",

These \" voices \" could then be used for \" psychological operations, making announcements, or just plain weirding out the enemy, \" writes kyle mizokami. The details of what's called the laser-induced plasma effect come from a report at defense one. One laser, called a femtolaser, creates a ball of plasma that's hit by a second nanolaser. Tuned to a precise range of wavelengths, the laser manipulates the plasma to produce light and sound. In a video, a noise a bit like human mumbling can be heard during a second test of the device. The pentagon thinks it can produce intelligible words in about three years. \" we're this close to getting it to speak to us, \" says david law of the pentagon's joint non-lethal weapons program. A second video shows the weapon creating the sound of a stun grenade. But the plasma can also be manipulated to produce heat, as seen in one test that caused a military uniform to burn, reports ars technica. Potentially, this could be done from a distance of several miles, law says, noting an 8-inch laser mirror would create the effect about three miles away. A person between the weapon and the target would be unaffected, he adds. Some other possible uses: warning ( or frightening ) people away from a military checkpoint or perhaps mimicking the sound of gunfire. ( it seems that orcas can sound like humans, too. )",

        "summary": "The suicide of \" world's best chef \" benoit violier illuminates not only the 44-year-old's personal troubles, but also the more pervasive pressures felt by many of the world's top culinary artists. The guardian reports violier had suffered recent personal loss, including the deaths of his dad and his cooking mentor within months of each other. But the paper also notes that other top chefs have suffered from depression and anxiety, and even taken their own lives, and that violier's suicide highlights the \" extraordinary, sometimes unbearable pressures they must face. \" among those pressures, per the guardian and the new york times: demands for perfection, an aversion to showing weakness, and a fear that restaurants will be downgraded and hard-won reputations sullied. \" they tell you you're one of the very best; then, overnight, they tell you you're not, \" a parisian chef tells the guardian, referencing the 2003 suicide of chef bernard loiseau. Loiseau shot himself after an esteemed guide lowered his eatery's rating and it was rumored michelin would do the same. \" if i lose a star, i ' ll kill myself, \" he had told a fellow chef shortly before his death ( michelin ended up maintaining his rating ). Some chefs find the highly coveted stars they're awarded so burdensome that they actually give them back, saying the high stakes involved make them sick. This isn't new, either: the guardian points out that francois vatel, a 17th-century \" celebrity chef \" who cooked for royalty, fell ( literally ) on his own sword when the fish he needed for a louis xiv dinner never showed. All of this leads to another debate broached by chefs in the times: whether there are adequate resources and support for chefs in this pressure-cooker career. \" it can't keep happening; it just can't, \" says a food writer who started the chefs with issues project to shed light on the industry's stresses and proliferating mental illnesses. ( just last year, a famed chicago chef took his own life. )",

        "summary": "Neither party budged, and now the \" nuclear option \" has been invoked in the senate. Republicans on thursday changed the chamber's rules to break the democrats ' filibuster of supreme court nominee neil gorsuch, reports the ap. The change, allowing republicans to end debate with a simple majority instead of 60 votes, paves the way for a final confirmation vote on friday. The immediate effect is that gorsuch is all but ensured of his seat on the court, while the longer-term implications are being hotly debated: this rule change affects filibusters on judicial nominations, but what if filibusters were eventually curtailed on regular legislation, too? that would have far broader implications and make the senate more like the house, explains the new york times. While majority leader mitch mcconnell insists he'd never take this step, democrats are skeptical. Pressure could grow on republicans to ditch the legislative filibuster if they struggle to get things passed, such as repeal of obamacare, notes the daily intelligencer. So what just happened? here's a primer on the \" nuclear option \" via the wall street journal. The name came from former sen. Trent lott, who worried about the precedent of changing longstanding senate rules. Watch the moment mcconnell made the move, via this video at the washington post. One likely outcome of the move is that we can expect more ideological judges on the supreme court, leaning left or right depending on which party is in control, predicts npr. Mcconnell made the case that the senate once gave greater leeway to presidents on supreme court picks and thus killing the filibuster is a return to tradition. John mccain, though he voted with party leaders, thinks it's dangerously unwise. The washington post looks at the differing views among senior republicans. Mcconnell was seen high-fiving after the move, while mccain grumbled, \" bad day for democracy, \" per politico. What's next? democrats have a maximum of 30 hours to delay proceedings, and they're expected to make use of them all. Axios expects the vote on gorsuch to come friday evening. The ap notes that thursday's move has precedent: democrat harry reid invoked the nuclear option in 2013 because republicans were blocking lower-court judicial appointees of president obama. Reid's move affected only that year's congress and exempted supreme court nominees.",

As a forensic artist for the houston police department in texas, her visionary talent has helped to positively identify 751 criminals and secure over 1,000 convictions. Each day, she sits at her blank easel with charcoal in hand; meeting people whose lives have been stricken by burglars, murderers, and abusers. More often than not, the victims who come to her have only seen their assailant during the fleeting and unnerving time they were targeted. Many say they wish they could offer more details to construct the portrait - but the nature of the crime committed against them means they have little recollection of their attacker. When this happens, lois hears what they have to say as they sit across from her in the room of the police department. She connects with them, nods, and discusses something else, pondering the character"

Israel says it has apprehended a gang of thieves doing the latter from a judean cave in the same region as the caves that once housed the dead sea scrolls, the bbc reports. The six men, indicted sunday, allegedly stole artifacts including a comb designed in roman times to remove hair lice; antiquity officials say the men may have been after more scrolls or scroll fragments, the ap reports. Authorities say they caught the gang in late november exiting the \" cave of skulls \" — which is located in the side of a cliff — equipped with \" sophisticated metal detectors \" and \" lighting equipment and ropes. \" they were caught after an israeli antiquities inspector, in the area training as a rescue volunteer, happened to take a photograph of the cave and noticed two men standing near it. \" no one has any business being there on a saturday morning, \" he explains. Authorities have been after \" gangs of antiquities robbers... Operating along the judean desert cliffs \" for years, says an israeli anti-looting inspector in a statement. But none have been caught \" red-handed \" for decades, he adds, \" mainly due to the difficulty in detecting and catching them on the wild desert cliffs. \" livescience reports that the cliffs'dry climate is ideal for preserving ancient bone, leather, wood, and parchment — including the dead sea scrolls, which were discovered in the 1940s and ' 50s.

The items used to belong to thomas kramer, the hard-partying playboy and former property developer responsible for the portofino tower. But they were seized, along with kramer's two south beach mansions, following a legal battle with the heirs of his former father-in-law, siegfried otto, reports the miami herald. Kramer claimed the millions he received from otto to invest in real estate came as a gift; in 2012, otto's heirs successfully argued in swiss courts that it was a loan. Last year, a miami-dade civil court judge ruled the $ 200 million judgment could be enforced in the us, and kramer's creditors swooped in. An attorney representing otto's heirs says offers are now welcome on the 11-bedroom and 4-bedroom mediterranean-style star island mansions that have been vacant since 2012. The homes ' contents, however, will be sold as a single lot at an auction at a miami-dade county sheriff's office building on feb. 14, per curbed. Included is a king-size bed set up for bondage, a large metal velociraptor, a life-size statue of what appears to be a boozy monk, and many other items showing kramer's apparent fondness for pigs and the color red. The herald notes kramer doesn't seem too upset that his possessions will soon be sold. In a facebook message from switzerland, he says he has no regrets from his \" great 20-year ride in miami \" and is now living a \" much easier, less complicated life \" in europe with \" less alcohol \" and \" less parties. \" ( no one was willing to pay enough for hitler's mercedes at this recent auction. )",

Obama entered the white house, according to a new wall street journal/nbc news poll. The survey also shows grave and growing concerns about the gulf oil spill, with overwhelming majorities of adults favoring stronger regulation of the oil industry and believing that the spill will affect the nation's economy and environment. Sixty-two percent of adults in the survey feel the country is on the wrong track, the highest level since before the 2008 election.

            "Washington — congressional republicans, not resting with the internal revenue service scandal, are moving to broaden the matter to an array of tax malfeasances and \"intimidation tactics \" they hope will ensnare the white house. Republican charges range from clearly questionable actions to seemingly specious allegations, and they grow by the day. On friday, lawmakers sought to tie the i.r.s. Matter to the carrying out of president obama's health care law, which will rely heavily on the agency. Whether they succeed holds significant ramifications for mr. Obama, who will soon know if he is dealing with a late spring thunderstorm that may soon blow over or a consuming squall that will leave lasting damage.

A study out of the uk's university of surrey and published in atmospheric environment finds that when drivers are stopped at a traffic light, they're being exposed to harmful nanoparticles emitted from vehicles; these pollutants are known to factor into heart and respiratory diseases. Researchers found that while a driver spends just 2 % of his or her total driving time at signal-controlled intersections, that amount of time accounts for 25 % of total exposure to such particles while in the car, per a press release. Researchers note that pedestrians should be wary of crossing intersections for the same reason. Such intersections are high in pollution for many reasons: cars have to rev their engines when the light turns green, and cars sandwich close together at traffic lights, which puts drivers \" pretty close to the air pollution source \" — that would be the tailpipe of the car ahead, the lead researcher notes in the conversation. Peak particle concentration was found to be 29 times higher at intersections during heavy traffic as compared to portions of the road where traffic flowed unobstructed. \" it's not always possible to change your route to avoid these intersections, but drivers should be aware of the increased risks at busy lights, \" says the author. No alternative route? here are some best practices: \" keep vehicle windows shut, fans off, and try to increase the distance between you and the car in front where possible. \" ( you may especially want to avoid intersections if you're pregnant. )",

Per the connecticut post, larry johnson wheeled himself into a jewelry store in stamford town center on aug. 2, 2014, and requested a closer look at a $ 37,000 rolex watch. Once he had it in hand, he's said to have leaped out of the wheelchair, doused the clerk and a security guard with pepper spray, and sprinted out of the store, knocking the guard down as he went. A local police officer, however, managed to pick up a fingerprint from one of the chair's wheels, and combined with employees who ided him in a lineup, johnson was extradited in 2015 from new york state, where he has about 20 other criminal convictions, including for sexual assault, drug charges, and assaulting a cop, per a 2015 article in the stamford advocate. He was also suspected for another wheelchair theft in white plains, ny, per lohud.com, but his lawyer says charges weren't brought against him in that case. For his plea deal, johnson agreed to six years of prison and eight years of \" special parole. \" his sentencing is dec. 7.

Les yasinsky spends most friday and saturday nights staked out near bars looking for people who \" are falling over drunk and … get into their cars and drive away, \" he tells the cbc. He follows them, records evidence with his dash-mounted camera, then calls police. It's a small service he wishes could've caught the driver who — with a bac level five times the legal limit — killed his 22-year-old son, brett, in 2010, per global news. But yasinsky says he's helped catch five drunk drivers since, which is some consolation. He hopes to form dads against drunk driving — involving \" guys like myself volunteering their time, going out sitting and watching, \" he says — to catch even more. \" these drunk drivers don't understand it's not only the victims. Their families also become victims of this. It affects so many people, \" says yasinsky, who wants to see tougher penalties for impaired drivers. Though drunk drivers have their vehicles impounded, yasinsky wants to see them lose their vehicles permanently for the first offense. \" it's a weapon, \" he says. \" if somebody shoots somebody, they take the gun away. They don't get it back. \" in the meantime, \" it does feel pretty good \" to \" say i got another one off the road... And somebody's not dead because of that one person, \" says yasinsky. He adds he \" never really vented from losing brett \" and tells cjob, \" this is my way of channeling that energy, to do something that's going to hopefully save lives. \" ( this cop caught 4,000 drunk drivers, then tragedy struck. )",
