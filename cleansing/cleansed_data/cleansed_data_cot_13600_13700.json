        "summary": "A woman could face 10 years in prison after twerking on a man without his consent at a gas station in dc, reports the houston chronicle. The unidentified victim says the abuse started when two women flashed him while he was pumping gas on oct. 7. While in the checkout line, police say ayanna marie knight, 22, of las vegas, began rubbing her buttocks against the man. He tells nbc washington he tried to back away from knight, but the abuse continued, as seen in a surveillance video released monday. A second woman, who police have not been able to identify, then \" grabbed ( the victim's ) groin and buttocks multiple times in a very aggressive manner, \" authorities say. When the man told the gas station clerks to call police, he says they \" just sat there, \" leaving him feeling \" humiliated. \" \" when someone is just grabbing your body parts without your permission, no matter who it is, that's just a violation completely, \" the man says. He tells fox 5 dc that he thought his assailants were prostitutes and \" men dressed like women, \" and feared men outside the gas station were their pimps. They could've had \" guns to come and shoot me, \" he says. He says he left the checkout area but one woman grabbed his arm to keep him from leaving. He eventually called police from the gas station's car wash. Though jokes about the incident are rampant on social media, a rep for dc group collective action for safe spaces says the incident \" is a prime example of the public sexual harassment and assault that people across our city experience on a near-daily basis. \" knight has been charged with third-degree sexual abuse.

There used to be more than 9,000 across the country. In 2013, he told the wall street journal that he decided to keep licensing the blockbuster name because a lot of people associate the name with happy memories. He says one reason why the stores have managed to survive so long in alaska is because people enjoy the selection and the social aspect — and another is that internet in the state tends to be expensive and charged by data usage, meaning a trip to blockbuster can work out a lot cheaper than binge-watching on netflix.

        "summary": "Detroit's bankruptcy may not have surprised many people — \" this has been coming for ages, \" one pained city worker tells the new york times — but it does have everyone talking. What went wrong? what happens next? we're glad you asked. What happened: much of the problem stems from the decline in the auto industry, which, according to the week's timeline, began in the ' 70s, when the gas crisis spurred interest in more efficient imports. But things really sped up around 2000. Since then... Unemployment has tripled, peaking at almost 28 % in 2009. Today it's at about 16 %. Crime has spiked, with homicide rates now at historic highs, usa today reports. Police take an average of 58 minutes to respond to calls. Many residents, particularly middle class ones, have fled in response; the city's population has dropped 25 % since 2000. That exodus has left 78,000 city structures abandoned. All of which has led to a 30 % plunge in tax revenue over a decade. That's made city services even worse. \" there's no way detroit can afford to service 140 square miles anymore, \" economist eric scorsone tells nbc news. \" so for parts of the city if your streetlight's out, they're not going to fix it. \" indeed, 40 % of the city's streetlights don't work. And hanging over the city are massive unfunded pension obligations, currently totaling $ 18 billion, or $ 25,000 for every resident. The city's top two creditors are its general retirement system and police and fire retirement system, the detroit free press reports. What's next: city officials have insisted that day-to-day city business will go on unimpeded; they're free to use their cash on hand to fund public works. Detroit will get an automatic stay on all its bills and all lawsuits against it, though it ' ll still have to pay secured creditors, according to usa today. A judge will have to agree that things are bad enough to warrant bankruptcy. Assuming that happens, the city will craft a reorganization plan, hopefully with the support of creditors. That will surely involve cuts to pensions, something the unions are staunchly against. Whatever happens will be watched closely. \" everyone will say, ' oh well, it's detroit, ' \" scorsone says. But \" it's the same in chicago and new york and san diego and san jose. … they may not be as extreme as detroit, but a lot of them face",

That je ne sais quoi is actually the smell of disinfection byproducts or dbps, created when pee, sweat, dirt, and lotions mix with cleaning chemicals, the american chemical society helpfully explains in a summer-ruining youtube video. Those dbps are also what make your eyes turn red and have been linked to respiratory issues like asthma. So, as maddie stone writes at gizmodo, \" unless you want to be swimming in a toxic stew, do us all a favor and use the toilet and shower like a goddamn adult \" before jumping in.",

Satellite images taken sunday, first published by fox news, appear to show two batteries of eight missile launchers and a radar system on woody island. China's foreign minister didn't confirm or deny the deployment but described the \" self-defense facilities \" on islands in the south china sea as \" limited and necessary \" and \" consistent with the self-defense and self-preservation china is entitled to under international law. \" us officials and taiwan, which claims woody island as its own phu lam island, later confirmed the deployment, per the guardian and cnn.

But that doesn't seem to have fazed president obama, even after china's frosty reception to a us flyover of a man-made island in december. \" the us will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, \" obama said tuesday at a meeting with the association of southeast asian nations. \" we will support the right of other countries to do the same. \" taiwan president-elect tsai ing-wen tells reuters that tensions have been raised in the region and \" we urge all parties to work on the situation. \" a rep for japan's foreign ministry adds moves like china's raise \" serious concerns \" and \" cannot be accepted. \" ( china is building an airstrip on another island. )",

Both candidates talked about women on the campaign trail — as did their surrogates — and the romney campaign released a new ad shedding a more moderate light on his abortion stance. Elsewhere on the trail: \" what i can't understand is how ( romney ) has gotten in this sort of 1950s time warp in terms of women, \" joe biden told a crowd in colorado, referring to romney's debate performance, in which he said women workers often had to rush home to make dinner for their kids, cnn reports, though it notes that romney's comments scored well with women on the network's dial test. Romney and his surrogates, meanwhile, tried to court women by focusing on the economy. \" the no. 1 issue with women is jobs, \" said rep. Marsha blackburn. But the la times points out that polls in 12 swing states show abortion is the no. 1 issue with women, ranking it twice as important as jobs. Romney strategists tell the new york times that their focus groups showed the same thing, which is why they've released a new ad in which a woman discovers that romney \" doesn't oppose contraception at all \" and supports abortion in cases of rape, incest, and when the health of the mother is at stake. \" this issue is important to me, but i ' m more concerned about the debt our children could be left with, \" she says. Meanwhile, the fallout from romney's \" binders \" comment continues. The boston globe reported that during romney's bain tenure, the firm didn't have a single female partner — though the washington post notes that meg whitman did get her start there as a consultant.",

            "A town or village with an embarrassing name has two options: they can change it or get in on the joke. This week there were examples of both. The latter was in scotland, where the whimsical folk of the tiny village of dull embraced silliness on a transatlantic scale by becoming the official sister community of the oregon town of boring. The former, less whimsically, in austria, where the residents of a village named fucking voted to change its name to fugging, only to discover that another village also originally called fucking had bagsied fugging 100 years earlier. Which, frankly, serves them right for refusing to stand proud. Not least because a daft or obscene name can bring much more to a place than sniggering strangers. Including business. Take, for example, the town of tightwad in missouri, named – according to local legend – after a particularly parsimonious greengrocer. Four years ago, local entrepreneurs founded tightwad bank, for \" customers with a sense of humour \", and brought in well over $ 1m in deposits. Then there's the village of muff in county donegal where, in the late 80s, a local scuba enthusiast spotted a pun too filthy to miss and founded a diving society.

According to that adviser, donald trump jr. Contacted him with a most interesting offer for his boss: a chance for kasich to become \" the most powerful vice president in history, \" per the times, by helming both domestic and foreign policy. And while a supposedly all-powerful kasich ( said to be the trump team's \" perfect choice, \" per the article ) would be doing most of the heavy lifting, \" making america great again \" is what jr. Allegedly said his dad would be doing. Kasich reportedly rejected the offer at the end of may in a phone call with trump. Josh voorhees writes for slate that, as strange as this story is, it \" isnt the first time someone close to trump has suggested that the gop nominee would effectively outsource the day-to-day \" presidential tasks: in may, trump campaign manager paul manafort told the huffington post that trump \" sees himself more as the chairman of the board than even the ceo, let alone the coo. \" chris cillizza pipes in with a similar take at the washington post, adding, \" [ trump ] has repeatedly expressed little interest or curiosity in the nuances and intricacies of policy, and he's made clear he thinks most average americans don't care, either. \" meanwhile, at the national review, charles cooke compares trump to a \" too-powerful queen who thinks that her palace is all a big joke.

Prosecutors say silas duane boston, 75, beat and hog-tied christopher farmer and girlfriend peta frampton aboard his boat in belize before throwing them overboard 38 years ago. The manchester couple were in their 20s and recent law and medical school graduates when they were killed, and their bodies were found floating off the coast of guatemala in july 1978. Although the skipper was suspected in the deaths, investigators could not make the charges stick until they caught a break while looking into the 1968 disappearance of boston's wife, mary lou. ( boston is alleged to have shot and killed her. ) during an interview in that earlier case, boston's son, vince, revealed what happened aboard his dad's boat when he was 13 years old. His younger brother russell was also aboard and implicated his father, reports abc 10. Instead of taking the couple to mexico, boston, then 37, allegedly became enraged after an argument, beat and stabbed farmer, then threw him and frampton overboard after tying them up. If convicted, boston faces life in prison. He was arrested earlier this month at the convalescent home where he lived, and appeared at his arraignment on double murder charges in a wheelchair. He did not speak. Boston is also suspected in other killings, prosecutors said. ( australian police have gotten a break in a 47-year-old cold case. )",

        "summary": "Jimmy kimmel's blistering monologue on tuesday night against the latest gop plan to repeal obamacare called out one of its authors by name, and now louisiana sen. Bill cassidy is swinging back. What he and lindsey graham conceived would take the money obamacare spends on medicaid and insurance subsidies, trim it, and dole the resulting pot to the states to spend on health care as they like. On cnn's new day on wednesday, cassidy put it simply: \" i ' m sorry he does not understand. Under [ the bill ] more people will have coverage, and we protect those with pre-existing conditions. \" he says the latter point is true due to a provision that requires states seeking a waiver related to pre-existing conditions to guarantee those in this group have \" affordable \" coverage. More: need a primer on the ins and outs of the bill and its timing? we have you covered here. Politico clearly explains the medicaid part: obamacare pushed states to grant medicaid to those making up to 138 % of the federal poverty level. The cost of anyone who was newly qualified under the expansion was subsidized almost entirely by the feds; 31 states moved forward with expansions. The washington post declares that, actually, kimmel understands the bill pretty well. It assesses how five of kimmel's claims stack up. Rand paul is a firm no, and if two more senators come out against the bill, it ' ll fail. Which makes a letter against the graham-cassidy bill signed by 10 governors noteworthy, reports the washington post. The letter voices support for the bipartisan talks sens. Lamar alexander and patty murray have been leading. Among the signers is alaska gov. Bill walker, who could potentially sway the undecided lisa murkowski. On the flip side, 15 gop governors have come out in favor of the bill. Jeff stein of vox asked 9 gop senators questions about how the bill will improve the american health care system. Read their somewhat evasive answers here; sen. Pat roberts used a thelma &amp; louise analogy. Buzzy quote from a gop senior aide to axios: \" if there was an oral exam on the contents of the proposal, graded on a generous curve, only two republicans could pass it. And one of them isn't lindsey graham. \" writing for the national review, michael tanner calls the bill \" too mild. \" democrats have articulated pretty clearly what they want: a national government-run health care system. But rather than present their own \" ideological worldview \" on the subject, the gop's greatest goal is to pass something, making for legislation \" that slows",

Later, police announced that it had been built for \" personal reasons, \" and afterward, a young man named elton mcdonald told the toronto sun he'd been behind the whole thing. Now, he tells the tunnel's story — and his own — to nicholas köhler at maclean's. Mcdonald, 22, grew up on a street that köhler writes may be \" the toughest street in toronto — maybe even canada. \" shootings weren't unusual, and kids he went to school with \" are not alive anymore, \" mcdonald's sister says. \" they died when they were 16. \" the underground spot offered an opportunity to get \" away from regular things, away from life, \" says mcdonald. \" nothing in particular. Just life itself. \" he says it \" took a couple of years \" to build. The area where mcdonald grew up was home to a ravine and a creek where he and his childhood friends used to play. He built the tunnel nearby with an unidentified teenage friend. Mcdonald had grown up fascinated with building and was a natural when he began working in construction; his expertise explains why the tunnel was professionally crafted. After authorities found out about it, mcdonald came clean to his boss, who relayed the story to doug ford, brother of former mayor rob; doug facilitated the process of informing officials. No charges were filed, but the tunnel was filled in, to mcdonald's dismay: \" it was going to be my underground cottage, basically, \" he told the sun. But his sister sees a lesson of hope for the future: \" you manifested your dreams, \" she tells him. Now, he's starting his own construction business.",

More than 180 are buried in a graveyard there, and the northern arapaho are now reclaiming the three children that are theirs. This week, more than a dozen tribe members arrived on the former campus in carlisle, pa., from wyoming to oversee the exhumation of 14-year-old little chief, 11-year-old horse, and 9-year-old little plume — or, as the school insisted the latter be called, hayes vanderbilt friday. The children arrived at the school in 1881 and will soon return to fremont county, wyoming, for burial. Pennlive reports that the us army, the army national military cemeteries, and a number of anthropologists and archaeologists are carrying out the five-day exhumation, which began tuesday. There's a big \" x-factor, \" one archaeologist tells pennlive, in that the children were interred in wooden coffins, making the condition of their remains unknown. The process is being approached with great care: no machines, just shovels, hands, and mesh screens designed to sift out the smallest pieces of coffin or bone. The dead, many of whom couldn't withstand outbreaks of tuberculosis or the flu, hail from 50 different tribes, and future exhumations are expected. The ap reports the government is covering the $ 500,000 cost of returning the northern arapaho boys home.",

        "summary": "A new oscars category has been announced ahead of the 91st academy awards and people aren't happy. The academy of motion picture arts and sciences announced three major changes to its ceremony, perhaps the most notable of which is the addition of a new award for outstanding achievement in popular film. While details of the new honor weren't revealed in a recent letter sent out to academy members, the move has already been criticized. Vanity fair has dubbed it the \" black panther award, \" and voiced concerns that such a category could lead to a \" separate but equal \" mentality regarding such massively popular films as they exist alongside more traditional oscar fare. As the hollywood reporter notes, it's that huge popularity the academy is likely hoping will bring viewers back to the oscars, which saw its lowest rated telecast ever this past year. Another concern being voiced is the question of what will happen in years devoid of blockbusters like black panther that are are also critically acclaimed. For now, there are more questions than answers as the academy's announcement said only that \" eligibility requirements and other key details will be forthcoming. \" also revealed in the letter: first, the academy says it will announce and hand out some awards during commercial breaks in order to keep the telecast down to a hard three hours; second, the academy says it will move up the ceremony to feb. 9 in what's likely a bid to avoid the awards season fatigue it fears viewers may suffer at the end of a months-long awards season.

The reader and frost/nixon. But when the first 10-nominee best-picture field emerged in early 2010, what do you know: there were two sci-fi hits ( district 9 and avatar ) and a pixar movie ( up ) scattered in among the prestige fare. For a while, that seemed to be enough. The field of 10 made it reasonable to expect christopher nolan movies to show up at the oscars; put fire behind campaigns for the likes of get out and mad max: fury road; and still also made room for tiny hopefuls, from winter's bone to phantom thread, to have their place in the game. But based on the academy's announcement wednesday of plans for a special new oscar, \"designed around achievement in popular film, \" the blockbusters still don't have enough room at the oscar table.

York county sheriff's office photo search photos available for purchase: photo store → the son and his family live in a mobile home on john bubar's property, according to police. \"apparently, a dispute arose that day about rent payments and debris around the mobile home, \" sheriff bill king said. \"john bubar took the extraordinary step of using a large construction-grade front-end loader and backhoe to damage the mobile home. \" witnesses told police that john bubar used the front-end loader to pick up the mobile home and drop it on the ground three times, causing significant damage to the home. He then started to drive the bucket into the home and only stopped when he learned that his 7-year-old grandson was inside, king said. The grandson was not hurt during the incident. Reached by phone monday, michael bubar's wife declined to comment. John bubar was arrested on a charge of domestic violence reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon. Bail was set at $ 5,000. Bubar is expected to appear in york county superior court on feb. 10. Sunday's dispute is the seventh time the york county sheriff's office has responded to a call related to the pendexter road address since the beginning of the year. Records show the agency responded to 10 calls there in 2015, including at least one call about a domestic disturbance. Bubar has a prior criminal"

My \" case that happened 20 years ago is even more relevant today, \" anette sorensen tells the new york post.. She says american parents \" live in fear, \" and she still wants \" to show it's possible to live another way. \" sorensen parked her 14-month-old daughter in a stroller outside a restaurant in manhattan while she and the baby's father, a new york-based playwright, had margaritas inside on a chilly may evening, the ap reports. Sorensen said she repeatedly checked on the blanket-covered baby during the hour they were at the restaurant before a patron summoned police. The parents were arrested on child-endangerment charges that were eventually dropped. Child welfare authorities briefly took charge of the girl. \" i don't think there's any greater punishment than to have your child taken away from you, \" sorensen says. The episode sparked outrage from new york, where residents were astounded at the idea of parents depositing a child alone on a sidewalk, to denmark, where residents were equally stunned by the notion of being arrested for leaving a child unattended for a spell while dining. Sorensen filed a $ 20 million false-arrest lawsuit against the city. A jury in 1999 awarded her $ 66,000, rejecting many of her claims but agreeing that she should not have been strip-searched, among other findings. She has launched a kickstarter campaign to fund an english translation of a novel she wrote based on her 1997 experience.",

The aclu branch's legal director says in the statement that the veil of secrecy should be lifted in this \" highly unusual \" case.

Louis public radio reports, adding that mcculloch himself has done several interviews since the nov. 24 grand jury decision while the jurors remain barred from speaking. The public should have \" complete information not controlled by the government, \" the executive director of the missouri aclu tells the post-dispatch.

The bodies of philippe braham, yohan cohen, yoav hattab, and françois-michel saada, all murdered friday during a hostage standoff in a kosher market, were flown into ben gurion airport this morning, then carried by ambulance convoy to the givat shaul cemetery, cnn reports. \" this is not how we wanted to welcome you to israel — we wanted you alive, \" israeli president reuven rivlin said during the ceremony for the men, as per the times. Prime minister benjamin netanyahu also spoke, stressing that \" jews have the right to live in many countries, and it's their right to live there with full security. \" but he also repeated a controversial statement he had made over the weekend encouraging france's jews to move to israel, adding, \" i believe they know, deep in their hearts, that they have one country, the state of israel, that is their historic homeland. \" there are about 500,000 jews in france — europe's largest jewish population — but they've become increasingly unsure if they have a safe haven there, the times notes. Bibi's words have peeved french officials, who believe france's continued support of its jewish population serves as \" a litmus test of the republic's legitimacy, \" fox news notes. \" if 100,000 jews leave, france will no longer be france. The french republic will be judged a failure, \" french pm manuel valls told jeffrey goldberg in the atlantic.",

Percy's interest in poisonous plants had been piqued after visiting the remains of a medieval scottish hospital, so she set about creating alnwick castle's poison garden, labeled by smithsonian as \" the world's most dangerous garden. \" percy's driving motivation for her deadly creation? kids. \" i thought,'this is a way to interest children, \" she says. \" what's really interesting is to know how a plant kills you, and how the patient dies, and what you feel like before you die. \" behind locked gates adorned with skulls and crossbones and advertising that reads \" these plants can kill \" lie the estate's toxic specimens: more than 100 fatal flora, including hemlock, poppies, foxglove, and castor oil, from which deadly ricin is derived. One of percy's favorite plants: angel's trumpet, \" an amazing aphrodisiac before it kills you, \" she tells smithsonian. Because of the downright dangerousness of the plants ( some of them illegal — cannabis and cocaine are among the varieties the duchess maintains ), the garden needs special licensing to grow them, mother nature network reports. Visitors are banned from touching, tasting, or smelling the plants, though even those warnings aren't failproof: seven people reportedly fainted over the summer after breathing in fumes while walking through the garden.

In 1995, jane percy became the duchess of northumberland, a county in northeastern england that stretches to the border with scotland, after her husband's brother died unexpectedly. With the title came the alnwick castle, the traditional seat of the duke of northumberland ( it also served as the setting for hogwarts in the first two harry potter films ). After the family took up residence in the castle, percy's husband asked her to do something with the gardens, which at the time were a disused commercial forestry boasting nothing more than rows and rows of christmas trees. \" i think he thought,'that will keep her quiet, she ' ll just plant a few roses and that ' ll be it, ' \" the duchess says.

Cook's book paying the tab, and they may surprise you: the top 10 % of adult us drinkers consume an average of 74 alcoholic beverages per week — that's more than 10 drinks a day each. How many such drinkers are there? some 24 million of them. \" i agree that it's hard to imagine consuming 10 drinks a day, \" cook tells ingraham, but \" there are a remarkable number of people who drink a couple of six-packs a day, or a pint of whiskey. \" more than half of the alcohol consumed in a year is thanks to this top 10 %. As for the rest of america, 30 % of adults don't drink, and another 30 % drink an average of less than one drink each week. If you drink one glass of wine a day, you're in the top 30 % of us drinkers; two glasses a day and you're in the top 20 %. And as for why you consume the amount of alcohol you do, a new study out of penn state finds that genetic factors play a role. Evolution has wired us to find sweeter tastes more pleasant than bitter ones, and prior studies have found that some people find alcohol more bitter than others. The penn state study is the first \" to show that the sensations from sampled alcohol vary as a function of genetics, \" finding that a person's perception of alcohol was related to which variant of a \" bitter receptor \" gene that person has. \" prior work suggests greater bitterness and less sweetness each influence the liking of alcohol beverages, which influences intake, \" says the lead researcher; her adviser notes that genetic variation could be a risk factor in terms of who is more likely to become a heavy drinker upon early exposure to alcohol.

Szabo, who had attended his stepsister's wedding earlier that night, never regained consciousness after the punch. The 35-year-old died tuesday night after he was taken off life support. Police have released surveillance video of the driver, who sped off and is still at large. Colleagues at what if holdings, the marketing firm szabo worked for, say they're devastated by the death of a beloved colleague, cbs12 reports. \" i hope they find him and bring him to justice, \" ceo josh gillon says of the suv driver. \" this was really a stupid, stupid act.

        "summary": "It's a big week for gun control supporters, as the issue heads to the senate floor this week. Democrat joe manchin spent the congressional recess looking to forge ahead on background checks with gop support, and he and republican pat toomey have spent the past few days hashing out a bipartisan deal, the washington post reports. The proposed measure is expected to require background checks for almost all gun buyers, with the only exceptions being sales between close family members and some sales to hunters — thus addressing the key republican concerns over background checks. The move comes after weeks of negotiations between manchin and other senators stalled. What's in store this week? president obama and his team are starting an aggressive pro-gun-control push today with a speech by the president in connecticut; joe biden and michelle obama also have events planned this week, and any deal manchin and toomey come up with is expected to be announced tomorrow or wednesday. Will there be a decision this week? harry reid will likely be quick to include that deal in the bill, which already includes plans to expand background checks, increase federal funding for school security, and make gun trafficking a federal crime. But republicans could use procedural rules to delay the process — and thus any decision — into next week ( at least 13 are already planning a filibuster ). What about other gun control changes? other potential amendments to the main bill, like bans on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, are considered unlikely to pass, but expanded background checks enjoy wide public support. Just how many bills are there? at least three different bills address background checks, and democrats must decide which one to advance, politico reports: manchin's, which does not require expanded background checks for private sales; tom coburn's, which calls for universal background checks with quite a few exemptions; and chuck schumer's, the most expansive bill, which is only backed by democrats and would likely be defeated.

And he's kind, understanding, and he's a very compassionate father. \" republican scott brown's two daughters this afternoon called on their father's democratic rival, martha coakley, to take down a television ad that highlights an amendment that brown filed in 2005 that in certain cases would have allowed doctors to deny emergency contraception for rape victims. The amendment, which did not pass, was attached to a bill that he ultimately voted for, which required emergency rooms to provide the contraceptives to rape victims. In coakley's latest ad, released after a heated debate monday night, a narrator says, \"brown even favors letting hospitals deny emergency contraception to rape victims. \" brown and his supporters have declined to discuss the underpinnings of his amendment, instead trying to focus on the fact that he supported the overall legislation. \" this is the message: the message is that scott brown was behind that legislation and voted for it in 2005, \" angela davis, co-chair of \"women for brown, \" said this afternoon. \"this is desperation, and it's disgusting, and she needs to take down the ad. \" the brown campaign news conference came after a group of women supporting coakley bitterly railed this morning against brown, questioning his views on reproductive rights, saying his political positions were dangerous for women, and that he was using \" smoke and mirrors \" to obscure his true beliefs and previous record. \" time and again, scott brown has shown that he is willing to compromise, for political gain"

It all started when the boyfriend — joseph patterson, 27 — called 911 from an apartment in sioux falls, south dakota, to report a choking, the pioneer press reports. Emergency responders arrived and took the boy to hospital, where doctors said he appeared to have suffered a severe beating. Patterson was arrested and charged with aggravated felony assault and battery of an infant, which could put him away for 40 years. And now that the child has died, prosecutors say they may file extra charges. This isn't patterson's first brush with the law, either: another woman, who's had a child with patterson, claimed he threatened, choked, and punched her, but charges were ultimately dropped, the argus leader reports. As for peterson, he took a day off from minnesota vikings practice yesterday to be with his child, who was on life support at the time. \" this is an absolute tragedy, \" said state's attorney tom wollman, \" and the parents and the extended family are suffering greatly. \"",

After all, 69 % of healthy american adults do, according to a new study released by the nyu langone medical center. That's the bad news.

Whereas past studies looked only for the harmful strains of hpv, this one widened its net. \" we don't want people to be alarmed, \" one researcher tells livescience.

        "summary": "Hulu's new series the handmaid's tale, which premiered wednesday, tells the story of a future united states, called gilead, in which women are forced to give up their rights to work, own property, and control their bodies following the slow adoption of a totalitarian government. It's based on the 1985 dystopian novel by margaret atwood, but co-star samira wiley tells cnn it's \" scarily relevant right now, \" and she's not alone in voicing that sentiment. Some reactions to that idea and the series overall: atwood herself amplifies the point to the los angeles times, saying that the cast woke up on the morning after donald trump's election \" and thought, we're no longer making fiction — we're making a documentary. \" oh, come on, writes heather wilhelm at the national review. She says she must have missed \" the brutal rise of a women-enslaving dystopia \" in modern america and accuses feminists of hypocrisy on that front. For all \" their talk about women needing to ' control their own bodies, ' feminists often act as if women are helpless and completely incapable of doing so on their own. \" at bloomberg, megan mcardle also thinks the trump comparisons are \" nonsense. \" she reread the novel amid the hullabaloo and concludes that while there's \" nothing wrong with enjoying implausibilities on a screen or page, \" there is \" something very wrong with hysterically declaring that those things are reality. \" but anna merlan at jezebel argues the handmaid's tale is \" horribly relevant \" with \" a feeling that it takes place in a moment just around a lurking corner from our own. \" she's disappointed that some cast members are disavowing the feminist label, and she sees a parallel between the show and star elisabeth moss'refusal to discuss her belief in scientology, known for its \" abuses against women. \" lili loofbourow also writes about this shying away from the feminist label at the week, with one theory being that the cast might be leery after hillary clinton's loss to be associated with \" failure. \" she digs into the nuances of the label, but also makes a point to praise the show itself as \" beautifully done and spectacularly acted. \" moss talks about the politics of the show in an interview with vox. \" i wish it wasn't so relevant, but you can't be in the world today and awake as a woman and not be aware of your rights being infringed upon. \" eric deggans at npr is among those worried about modern parallels. \" in",

The 15-year-old took his own life on dec. 8 after his parents found out the school wasn't going to give their son the letter of recommendation he needed to take the entrance exam for his high school of choice. The school, located in the town of fuchu, wouldn't pen the letter because the teen's file noted he had been busted for shoplifting during his first year at the school — even though it turned out it had been a different student who committed the crime. \" our child would never have taken his life if the school's data management had not been sloppy, \" a statement from the boy's family read. What's said to have happened: the teacher who entered the shoplifting charge into the school's records was basing the entry on a verbal report from another faculty member and plugged in the wrong name. The mistake was discovered in october 2013, but while the error was fixed on paper, it remained in the school's electronic records. The school's in-house probe found the school was to blame for the boy's death due to \" poor clerical management and career guidance, \" per kyodo news. The \" career guidance \" portion relates to the boy's homeroom teacher, who spoke with him five times about progressing to high school, reports the mainichi. Those sessions consisted of five-minute interactions in the school hallway. Principal hiroshi sakamoto also apologized for initially saying the boy had died of heart failure.

Ikea will pay $ 50 million to the parents of three toddlers who died when its dressers toppled onto them, lawyers for the families said wednesday. The settlement comes six months after those deaths and others prompted the unprecedented recall of 29 million ikea dressers that the company acknowledged could tip over and injure or kill children. Jackie collas of west chester, whose 2-year-old son, curren, was crushed by an ikea dresser in 2014, said she was relieved the fight was over. But she said the settlement does not bring closure over curren's death. \" your life, it will always be cut in half, \" collas said wednesday. \" even if i live until 100, it's going to be before curren and after curren. \" the plaintiffs also include the parents of 2-year-old camden ellis of snohomish, wash., who died in 2014, and 22-month-old theodore mcgee of apple valley, minn., who died in 2015. Their wrongful death suits, filed in philadelphia, were part of a wave of scrutiny on ikea and the wider danger of furniture tip-overs.

Jacobia english lane had joined a gathering of friends and family members ( the observer, the ap, and wsoc say up to 30 had congregated; the gaston gazette says 17 ) on the eve of the funeral for her sister-in-law, who had died after a long battle with cancer, when about 30 bullets from what a local detective confirmed was a high-powered rifle flew through the air outside and struck her brother's home at around 12: 30am; one bullet hit the 37-year-old lane in the back of the head as she sat on a couch inside, family spokesman christopher dennis says. Dennis — who calls the occurrence a \" senseless, unprovoked act of violence, \" per the observer — says a bullet also pierced a pillow on a bed where lane's husband was sleeping, though he wasn't injured. Lane's 13-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter witnessed her death. Cops say a teen in the home was also hit in the arm with a bullet but will be fine. \" my sister and my wife were best friends, \" tim english, lane's brother and the deceased woman's widower, tells the gazette, noting how lane would often make the two-hour drive to visit his wife during her illness. \" we were all just... Remembering the good times we had with my wife. \" police are asking for the public's help in identifying the shooter. \" i think they're going to turn themselves in because of their conscience, \" english says. \" but if anybody has anything, please come forward. \" ( this man lured his wife to her death by killing her family. )",

The ships arrived saturday, officially to provide maritime training to syria, according to iran's state-run tv. But their presence, along with that of russian ships, has ratcheted up tensions, the new york times reports. One senior iranian lawmaker said they sent \" a clear message against the united states ' possible adventurism. \" the lawmaker specifically condemned john mccain's call to arm the syrian rebels, warning of a \" crushing response \" from iran and russia if the us committed such a \" strategic mistake. \" that wasn't the day's only iranian saber-rattling, either; the country also warned that it was now considering preemptive strikes to protect its nuclear program. \" if we feel our enemies want to endanger iran's national interests … we will act without waiting for their actions, \" its deputy armed forces chief said.",

            "A visit by international nuclear inspectors to iran ended in failure tuesday. Tehran not only blocked access to a site the inspectors believe could have been used for tests on how to produce a nuclear weapon, they reported, but it also refused to agree to a process for resolving questions about other \"possible military dimensions \" to its nuclear program. The announcement came in a terse press release from the international atomic energy agency, a united nations agency, which said its inspection team had left the country. The agency is expected to release its latest report on the status of iran's program in the next week. The inspectors ' previous visit to iran ended several weeks ago with no agreement other than to meet this week. Iran's refusal to deal with the inspectors ' questions is likely to increase tension, at a moment of heightened sanctions and after the assassination of nuclear scientists in iran and suspected retaliation against israeli diplomats. Iran struck an increasingly bellicose tone on tuesday, with an iranian official warning that the country would take pre-emptive action against perceived foes if it felt its national interests were threatened. The country also laid down new conditions for oil sales.

The worst violence on tuesday was reported in the central city of homs, which has been under sustained assault for more than two weeks. The day's toll of that city's residents, as compiled by various groups that try to track the violence from inside and outside the country, ranged from 16 to more than 40 killed. At the same time, the faction of the opposition that is armed has claimed several more lives, according to the syrian government, whose news agency reported the funerals of three soldiers killed in or near damascus and in the city of hama, to the north. Russia announced that it would not participate in a meeting in tunisia on friday of a contact group of western and arab nations, friends of syria, where opposition figures were expected to lobby for greater international recognition and support.

Reports center on the navigator program, in which assistants, or \" navigators, \" advise americans on how to sign up for plans under the health law. Nineteen states, including florida, missouri, montana, and texas, limit navigators ' activities; in florida, for instance, they can't work in state offices, while missouri makes them take an exam and pay a fee for state licenses, nbc news reports. Backers of these laws say they're aimed at vetting people handling sensitive personal information. Nine states have also rejected obamacare's medicaid expansion. A george washington university team reviewed 606 of 1,198 community health centers backed by the federal government, comparing those in states with \"restrictive \" obamacare laws to those in states with \"full implementation \" of the health law. \"health centers in restrictive states reported approximately half the staffing capacity maintained by health centers in full implementation states, \" says researcher sara rosenbaum, and \"health centers in restrictive states were significantly less likely to assist with plan enrollment. \" in short, the study says, people living in restrictive states face more limited health care access, usa today explains. Adds rosenbaum: \"if anyone has any doubt, this should put it to rest. The navigator laws combined with opting out of medicaid really stopped outreach in its tracks. \"",

Although it's not uncommon for animals to be struck and killed by lightning, a decimation of this scale is less typical, a norwegian nature inspectorate rep says. \" reindeer are pack animals and are often close together, \" he adds, noting that the scared animals may have crowded even closer together if they were spooked during a thunderstorm. A spokesman for the norwegian environment agency tells the ap they're not sure if there was one massive lightning strike or several at once. Among the dead were 70 calves, he notes, adding that reindeer tend to migrate across the plateau in that area as the seasons start to change. Hunting season had also started earlier this month, which may have affected migration on the exposed range. Although the bodies of dead animals are often left to decompose on their own, officials are taking samples — they're also testing for chronic wasting disease, a type of encephalopathy that affects deer species — to figure out a definitive cause of death and decide what to do with the corpses.

Under a new proposal introduced yesterday, the italian city would fine tourists caught with a suitcase on plastic or hard rubber wheels up to $ 620 beginning in may, the local reports. Apparently the din from luggage rolling on the city's centuries-old paving slabs and bridges drives venetians bonkers, keeps them up at night, and amounts to \" noise pollution, \" per the city council. It says the incessant wheeling is also slowly damaging the slabs. What would be permitted: luggage with rubber wheels filled with air, though the city council acknowledges such baggage is hard to find. It also notes that enforcing the ban widely would be pretty tough — 60,000 tourists pour into the city daily. Further, the telegraph describes wheeled bags as a must in a city whose lack of roads means tourists typically have to walk ( or take a water bus ) to their hotel. Still, the city hopes a company will jump at the opportunity to make specifically venice-friendly bags. ( a town in hawaii wants to ban tourists altogether. )",

Shopkeepers, cafe owners and residents say they are being driven half mad by the incessant rumble of visitors trundling their luggage along the city's narrow alleyways and up and down delicate stone bridges. The wheeled suitcases are essential in a city without roads, where tourists have to reach their hotels either by water bus or by walking. Now venice council wants to introduce a ban on luggage equipped with hard rubber wheels, forcing the city's 27 million annual visitors to instead use suitcases that roll on air-filled, softer wheels that make less noise. The authorities are concerned about \" growing noise pollution \" caused not only by tourists using wheeled luggage, but local businesses wheeling goods around on trolleys, the council said in a statement. The daily rumble of wheeled suitcases was giving venetians \" serious discomfort \" and also causing the \" progressive deterioration \" of centuries-old paving slabs, marble steps and foot bridges, it added. The council, which is under special administration after a corruption scandal earlier this year forced the resignation of the mayor, wants to introduce the ban next may. After that, anyone with a noisy, hard-wheeled suitcase will be liable to a fine of up to 500 euros.

Venetians are tired of being kept awake at night by throngs of tourists, wheeling their luggage through the city's narrow streets and over its famous bridges. Now the city's special commissioner, vittorio zappalorto, has come up with a plan to let his citizens get their 40 winks: ban the suitcases. Under new anti-noise pollution proposals, tourists will be barred from bringing luggage with plastic or full rubber wheels to venice. But bicycle-style tyres, made from rubber and filled with air, will be allowed, ansa reported.

Shopkeepers, cafe owners and residents say they are being driven half mad by the incessant rumble of visitors trundling their luggage along the city's narrow alleyways and up and down delicate stone bridges. The wheeled suitcases are essential in a city without roads, where tourists have to reach their hotels either by water bus or by walking. Now venice council wants to introduce a ban on luggage equipped with hard rubber wheels, forcing the city's 27 million annual visitors to instead use suitcases that roll on air-filled, softer wheels that make less noise. The authorities are concerned about \" growing noise pollution \" caused not only by tourists using wheeled luggage, but local businesses wheeling goods around on trolleys, the council said in a statement. The daily rumble of wheeled suitcases was giving venetians \" serious discomfort \" and also causing the \" progressive deterioration \" of centuries-old paving slabs, marble steps and foot bridges, it added. The council, which is under special administration after a corruption scandal earlier this year forced the resignation of the mayor, wants to introduce the ban next may. After that, anyone with a noisy, hard-wheeled suitcase will be liable to a fine of up to 500 euros. For a city wrestling with so many problems – rising waters caused by global warming, an exodus of locals because of high rents and property prices",
            "The local · 20 nov 2014, 16: 39 published: 20 nov 2014 16: 39 gmt+01: 00 tourists to venice could face a € 500 fine if they dare wheel noisy suitcases around the watery city, under new proposals outlined on thursday. Venetians are tired of being kept awake at night by throngs of tourists, wheeling their luggage through the city's narrow streets and over its famous bridges. Now the city's special commissioner, vittorio zappalorto, has come up with a plan to let his citizens get their 40 winks: ban the suitcases. Under new anti-noise pollution proposals, tourists will be barred from bringing luggage with plastic or full rubber wheels to venice. But bicycle-style tyres, made from rubber and filled with air, will be allowed, ansa reported. If zapalorto's plan gets the go ahead, tourists will be fined between € 100 and € 500 if they break the suitcase rule. Venetians, however, will be free to continue to use whichever luggage they please. Story continues below … see also: € 500 fine for tourists who steal sicily rock"
