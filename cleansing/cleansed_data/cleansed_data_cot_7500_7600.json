            "For the united states ' first century, americans elected their leaders in full view of their neighbors, gathering on courthouse steps to announce their votes orally or hand a distinctive preprinted ballot or unfolded marked paper to a clerk. Such a public process made elections ripe for bribes and threats, although the scene around american polling places never matched australia's, where a population of criminals and goldbugs made electoral intimidation something of a democratic pastime. To end such shenanigans, each of australia's colonies began shifting to a secret ballot during the 1850s, and in 1872 england followed suit. A decade and a half later, the reform crossed the atlantic. Louisville, kentucky, enacted a so-called australian ballot in 1888, and 32 states did the same by 1892 — over the objections of machine politicians. By the turn of the century, most of the country had changed the public spectacle of election day into a solemn occasion for curtained isolation. This shift coincided with a dramatic drop in turnout rates, from nearly 80 percent of the eligible population in 1896 — which had been typical for the era — to 65 percent eight years later. They have never recovered, falling to around 50 percent in 1996. As modern civic activists have tried to increase turnout, their focus has been on reducing the hassle of participation. The",

The idea seems simple enough: give organ recipients a second transplant — of stem cells from the donor. This not only makes it more likely their body won't reject the organ, it keeps them off a lifetime regimen of nasty anti-rejection drugs. In the study, five of eight people who received kidneys that weren't perfect matches were able to be free and clear of such drugs within a year. \" it's almost surreal when i think about it because i feel so healthy and normal, \" says one of the recipients, a 47-year-old chicago woman, according to the bbc. If the results are borne out in larger studies, the ramifications could be huge: the procedure could make it easier for people on waiting lists to receive organs, because ones previously seen as incompatible could be used.

Investigators spoke to more than 200 witnesses and first responders, including one of the first police officers to arrive at the scene, who described it as \" the worst thing imaginable. \" \" some people were quiet, hiding, others were screaming or dying, grabbing at your legs because they wanted us to get them out, but our job at the moment was to keep going, \" he said. The report describes how a rookie cop was the first to identify farook, a county employee, as a suspect. The information led to a confrontation in which farook and malik exchanged fire with dozens of officers. The report says the officers fired 440 rounds, killing the couple within minutes. The couple fired 81 rounds, injuring two officers.",

The pittsburgh post-gazette has solid praise for battleground, saying it is \" a smart, well-written comedy series you might find on a premium cable network. \" the ap is less kind, however, calling it \" a light, watered-down knockoff of the office, \" while the new york daily news comes down somewhere in-between.

When he came up with \" just do it, \" he was thinking of a man in portland — the area where both his ad agency and nike are based.

Lutfi's attorney told the jury that his client was trying to keep an amphetamine-loving spears from using drugs, but lost control as she spiraled downward and was turned into a \" scapegoat \" and falsely accused, in spears ' mother's book, of drugging the pop star. Some of the crazier details from yesterday's lutfi camp opening remarks, from the ap and tmz: when lutfi was first hired, his lawyer said, he brought in drug-sniffing dogs to spears ' home and they found a substance spears admitted was likely crystal meth. The reason for that head-shaving incident? lutfi claims britney was so paranoid her hair would hold traces of the drugs she was using, she shaved it all off in an effort not to test positive and lose custody of her sons. Lutfi also says brit od ' ed on amphetamines in 2008, the night she was placed on a psychiatric hold. The trial — which is not expected to include testimony from brit herself — comes after years of legal wrangling between lutfi and the spears clan; the family got a restraining order against him at one point and another legal battle involving legal fees is also pending. When the spears side makes its opening remarks today, lawyers are expected to argue that lutfi basically acted as a drug pusher for britney, tmz reports.",

Where the myth stems from: it's true that the amino acid tryptophan is found in turkey, and when it enters the brain, it does eventually convert to melatonin — the sleep-inducing hormone. But as livescience explains, it normally has to fight the other amino acids in your body to get to the brain. Except carbs trigger the release of insulin, which sucks most amino acids from the blood — but leaves tryptophan alone. With a clear course, the amino acid gets through to the brain, leading livescience to declare that it's the stuffing and potatoes that are the true culprit. And as far as the tryptophan goes, turkey isn't so unique. In fact, cheddar cheese actually contains more tryptophan than turkey does per gram.

        "summary": "Perhaps you were wondering whether liz &amp; dick, laughable though it may be, would mark a real turnaround for troubled lindsay lohan. The answer: apparently not. Lilo was arrested yet again around 4am today in new york city on suspicion of assault, tmz reports. Sources say lohan and another woman got into an argument at a nightclub, and lindsay allegedly punched the woman in the face. Sources say the two ladies were sitting in booths near one another — the new york daily news'sources say both were in vip sections — when nearby club-goers got in a fight and both women got up to avoid it. At one point lilo reportedly said something along the lines of, \" give me my space, \" and one source says the other woman accidentally bumped into lohan. But they had both returned to their seats before the alleged punch. The other woman isn't expected to face charges, a police source tells nbc new york. Police had to intercept a car lindsay was leaving in by the time they arrived. ( one small sign of good judgment on lilo's part: she was the passenger, not the driver. ) she left a police station after almost four hours, the ap reports; tmz notes she probably received an order to appear before a judge soon. The gossip site has video of an upset lohan being placed into a cop car, saying, \" are you kidding? \" ( this is just the latest of lindsay's troubles: remember, she's also supposed to be charged with lying to cops in the near future. )",

Last week, a district judge decided the nine-year-old bull terrier, referred to as both buster and butch, should be put down following the grim find last in waterloo last september. Merseyside police, who'd applied for the destruction order, claimed the dog was aggressive when it was later dealt with by one of their handlers, pc stuart davidson, who was bitten. The dead owner's family also wanted the pet put down, believing it to be dangerous.

            "The court agreed - but solicitors acting for freshfields animal rescue centre and the senior staffy club have lodged an appeal, giving the animal a temporary reprieve pending a legal hearing. \"there has been a great deal of public support for this animal, suggesting this animal should not be destroyed, \" said solicitor james parry, representing the organisations acting on buster's behalf. \"there was no evidence in this case that the dog killed the deceased. \"we believe the tests applied to check on the animal were not appropriate and outdated. The 'alpha-role ' was adopted by the doghandler, anticipating the dog was going to bite him - it's an outdated tactic. \"dogs are scavengers by nature, but when they can't get food, they will get anything that is available to them, as was in this case. \"humans, put in the same ( starving ) position",
            "Ignorance will soon claim another innocent life- the failing of our inept justice system yet again. It is the unusual setting surrounding this un-heard of case that makes it so unique. In the end, you must be the judge- should this animal really die? is it truly the fearsome 'danger to society'some may have you believe, or simply another unfortunate victim? yet another court order passed, another judgement final, another dog is to be destroyed. Why? the unfortunate animal was found emaciated and abandoned, feeding off its'dead owner's corpse, at their home in waterloo, u.k. Should he die? buster's story 'dangerous beast!'this is likely the first thought going through your head, but look a little deeper. The dog, named both 'butch ' and 'buster ' in court papers, did not kill his owner, but resorted to"

Per 9to5mac.com, stacey gleeson noticed her daughter, giana, wasn't breathing back in march, and as she leaped into action to perform cpr, she dropped her iphone. As gleeson started taking life-saving measures on her baby, she shouted, \" hey siri, call the ambulance, \" 7 news reports. Gleeson was able to have a back-and-forth with emergency dispatchers as she continued cpr on giana, who the bbc reports had been dealing with a respiratory illness and chest infection. The child was breathing again by the time the ambulance arrived at their cairns home, and gleeson says doctors told her every second had mattered. The \" hey siri \" feature, which allows the ai assistant to be activated without the user having to press the \" home \" button or be plugged in to power, is available only on apple's newest devices ( gleeson has an iphone 6s ). Her husband, nic, tells 7 news the feature \" might have given the precious moments stacey needed to revive giana. \" gleeson tells the bbc she had \" played around with siri \" before — nic is in the navy, so she ' ll often put him on speakerphone while she's helping her kids get ready for bed — but she now recognizes the technology's value. \" saving me the trouble of having to physically dial emergency services was a godsend, \" she says. ( gleeson's story counters the results of a study on siri's performance in health crises. )",

No heads are rolling? a look around the landscape shows near-universal shock at rolling stone publisher jann wenner's decision to not fire reporter sabrina rubin erdely and various editors and fact-checkers associated with the story, the magazine's refusal to acknowledge any sort of institutional breakdown in need of correction, and wenner's shot at alleged rape victim \" jackie. \" without further ado: \" um, what? \" writes chris cillizza for the washington post. \" the stunning lack of accountability from rolling stone \" has given the fourth estate a serious black eye. \" failing to hold erdely — or anyone — accountable for doing their jobs very poorly is even worse. It suggests that not only did journalism swing and miss but we are acting like we are still at the plate and nothing has happened. \" \" they don't get it; they just don't get it, \" writes lloyd grove at the daily beast. Out of the entire 13,000-word takedown, \" the most incriminating detail is that nobody at the magazine seems to believe that its reporting, editorial, and fact-checking practices are in need of serious reform. \" \" it makes all journalists look bad when there's a terrible journalistic sin like this one, \" says cnn's brian stelter, per mediaite. \" it hurts the whole profession. And it's kind of baffling we're not seeing any disciplinary actions taken. \" he adds: \" i do wonder how brian williams feels. \" \" whatever culture that bred this story is poisonous, \" writes leah finnegan at gawker. \" and for wenner, a rich, powerful 69-year-old man, to place culpability for his magazine's lapse on a twentysomething pseudonymous woman, well, that tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it? \" the fault isn't jackie's, it's \" the empire's leader, wenner, who should take full responsibility for the article, fire everyone involved, and then fire himself for being a dumb, sexist idiot. \"",

Except these photos, posted in august, went viral, ostensibly because they show shirai's extensive chest and back tattoos.

Another giveaway: the photos showed shirai absent the tip of his pinkie, a common self-inflicted punishment among those yakuza who've made a mistake. Shirai reportedly fled to thailand in 2005 and married a woman there, and the ap reports by way of police that shirai was visited two or three times annually by cronies who provided him with cash.

        "summary": "Though online forums suggest she's not the first to manage the feat, doctors are celebrating the case of a breastfeeding transgender woman, the first to be recorded in medical literature. The 30-year-old went to doctors at new york's mount sinai hospital with the intention of breastfeeding when her partner — who did not want to breastfeed — was five months pregnant, per the study in transgender health. Though she hadn't undergone gender reassignment or breast augmentation surgery, she'd been taking hormone therapy for six years and was what doctors called a \" well-developed woman, \" per the guardian. Following a plan to induce lactation in non-trans women, she used a breast pump to stimulate milk production while taking domperidone — a nausea medication linked to increased production — and increasing doses of progesterone, estradiol, and spironolactone, reports new scientist. Progesterone and estradiol are female hormones, while spironolactone acts as an inhibitor to testosterone. Harder to come by was domperidone ( the patient got it from canada ) as it's banned in the us. According to the fda, it may boost the milk-producing hormone prolactin — doctors say chest stimulation does the same thing — but it has caused heart problems and death, though in those cases it was being administered intravenously. After three months, the woman could produce 8 ounces of milk per day, enough to keep her baby healthy and developing normally for six weeks, though the average baby consumes more than twice that daily. The woman afterwards supplemented with formula. Referring to the study as \" a very big deal, \" an endocrinologist who did not treat the woman predicts the practice \" will be extremely popular \" in the future, per new scientist, though doctors aren't recommending it at this time.",

        "summary": "A press conference scheduled for 10: 30am et thursday has the scientific world on the edge of its seats. The rumor/expectation/prevailing hope: that 100 years after albert einstein predicted their existence, the hunt for gravitational waves has led to their direct detection. In a media advisory released monday, the national science foundation, which is picking up the tab for the research being discussed, said only that it was providing a \" status report on the effort. \" the media is saying a lot more: the first question tends to be \" what are gravitational waves? \" put most simply, they're ripples in spacetime produced when a massive object accelerates. Most reports suggest ( as einstein did ) that you visualize a pebble thrown in a pond. Discovery paints it as such: \" should two black holes collide ( for example ), ' ripples ' in spacetime will carry energy away from the impact site at the speed of light. \" those ripples also carry info about their \" cataclysmic origins. \" we like nasa astrophysicist ira thorpe's description for reuters: \" you get radiation, basically light, when you move some sort of charged particle. When you're moving masses, you get gravitational waves. \" the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory ( ligo ), a system built by mit and caltech researchers in the quest to detect gravitational waves, has a great explainer. Tuck stebbins, the gravitational astrophysics lab chief at nasa's goddard space flight center, explains to the afp why this would be such a big deal. The upshot: \" there is no other way for humanity to see the origin of the universe. \" as for how ligo has been trying to detect the waves, popular science has a good primer. One of the measurements in question is an incredible \" 1/10,000th the width of an atom's nucleus. \" npr makes the scientific personal with an astrophysicist's recounting of the decades he has spent waiting for such an annoucement. As for what is stoking everyone's hopes: a recently tweeted email that included the words \" woohoo! ( i hope ). \" and before that, this january tweet. National geographic takes a look at some of the times ( \" he's been vindicated too many times to list here \" ) einstein has been proven right.

        "summary": "A huge hike in the price of a tuberculosis drug has been rolled back amid an outcry over the 5,000 % leap in the price of another drug. A nonprofit group affiliated with purdue university sold the rights to cycloserine to rodelis therapeutics on aug. 19, but it demanded them back after rodelis raised the price from $ 16 per capsule to $ 360, report the new york times and wall street journal. The chief of the purdue research foundation says rodelis on saturday returned the rights to the obscure drug, which treats drug-resistant tuberculosis but is only used by around 40 americans every year, the times reports. The foundation now plans to charge $ 35 a capsule to recover more of the costs associated with producing the drug; the not-for-profit had been losing $ 1 million annually on cycloserine, per the journal. Turing pharmaceuticals chief martin shkreli, however, has refused to back down from the huge increase in the price of toxoplasmosis drug daraprim despite heavy criticism. Hillary clinton tweeted yesterday that the \" price gouging \" is outrageous and that she's going to introduce a plan to combat it. Biotech shares plunged after clinton's announcement, bloomberg reports, and analysts say the controversy may help end the practice of buying up rare drugs and hiking the price. Shkreli \" bought this patent and he's milking it for all it's worth. In a way, i thank him, because it's really sort of like putting a sign on your back saying, ' kick me, ' \" princeton health care economist uwe reinhardt tells the washington post. \" sometimes you need some sentinel effect that wakes people up. \"",

Now, new commotion surrounding all the money in the world, with usa today reporting a good portion of the money in the reshoot budget went to mark wahlberg, not co-star michelle williams. Sources say that after the spacey-plummer swap, wahlberg received $ 1.5 million in the scramble to reshoot his scenes, while williams racked up less than $ 1,000 from her $ 80 per diem — 0.07 % of wahlberg's take. Both actors are repped by the william morris endeavor agency. Scott told usa today last month the $ 10 million reshoot was possible only because \" everyone did it for nothing \" and \" they all came in for free. \" however, behind the scenes, wahlberg's team had scooped up the big fee for him, and williams apparently had no clue. Both moviegoers and fellow stars railed against the news underscoring hollywood's gender pay gap, huffpost reports; it also notes that, looking carefully at the december usa today interview, scott never mentions wahlberg's name in the \" working for free \" column. An entertainment writer points out williams is considered the film's lead actress, while wahlberg is a supporting actor. Actress amber tamblyn deemed the news \" totally unacceptable, \" while director judd apatow tweeted, \" this is so messed up that it is almost hard to believe. Almost. This is how this business works. \" he then added: \" i wonder if the studio or wahlberg will do something to make the situation less insane. \" others online agree, saying the award-winning williams should get a retroactive fee. Newsweek notes that wahlberg was named the highest-paid actor in the world in an august forbes article, making $ 68 million in 2017.",

That's only partly why the washington post calls a recent catch in the north sea \" a one-in-a-billion discovery. \" dutch trawlers on may 30 discovered a two-headed harbor porpoise among their catch. Believing it would be illegal to keep the deceased specimen, they returned it to the water after first snapping four photos, per national geographic. When dutch researchers got hold of the images, they were amazed to see the first known conjoined twin harbor porpoises, with two fully-formed heads and a single well-developed body, estimated to be about 27.5 inches long and weighing at least 13 pounds, according to a deinsea study that notes five of the nine previous cases ( this makes 10 ) involved fetuses. It isn't clear why the twins formed as they did, but researcher erwin kompanje notes even \" normal twins are extremely rare in cetaceans \" because \" there is simply not enough room in the body of the female \" for two. Citing the presence of hair on the upper lip, an umbilical opening, a flat dorsal fin, and a tail that had not yet stiffened to allow for swimming, kompanje believes the males were born alive. As for how long they might have survived, kompanje thinks not very: the inadequacy of a single heart may have done them in, or they could have drowned as two brains tried to control the movement of one body. Though he describes losing the creature to the watery depths as a \" real horror, \" kompanje tells new scientist that \" any extra case...

Per the washington post, david sorensen, a speechwriter reporting to senior policy adviser stephen miller, stepped down from his role friday after his ex-wife, jessica corbett, to whom he was married for two-and-a-half years, detailed to the post what she says was a physically and emotionally violent marriage. Among her allegations: that sorensen put out a cigarette on her hand, ran over her foot with his car, and, in an incident that she says made her fear for her life, \" grabbed her menacingly by her hair \" while on their boat off the coast of maine. Corbett, who said she'd been afraid to call the cops on sorensen because he knew people in law enforcement, showed the post texts and emails from her ex that contained vulgar language toward her. Two people also told the post that corbett had told them she was being abused. Via a facebook message, sorensen told the new york times his ex-wife is being \" creative, \" and in a statement he adds he \" never committed violence of any kind against any woman in my entire life \" and says he was actually the victim of her \" repeated physical violence. \" he says she'd punched him several times; corbett acknowledges slapping him on multiple occasions after he called her vulgar names. White house officials say sorensen didn't need a security clearance for his post and that his background check was still in the works. Corbett, however, tells the post she told the fbi about the alleged abuse last fall. The white house says it learned about the allegations thursday. \" we immediately confronted the staffer, he denied the allegations, and he resigned today, \" spokesman raj shah says.",

Such is the plight of the columbus blue jackets ' jack johnson, reports the columbus dispatch. The 27-year-old has made about $ 18 million over nine years in the nhl, but pretty much all of it is gone — as are some future earnings, writes aaron portzline. As a result, johnson declared bankruptcy last month. The big problem? as a budding star, johnson turned over control of his money to his parents, who embraced a risky strategy known as \" monetizing \" — essentially borrowing money against their son's future earnings. After scores of defaults and lawsuits, johnson now has less than $ 50,000 in assets to his name. \"jack would ask ( his parents ) questions: 'what's this? what are these guys calling about? ' \" one source tells the newspaper. \" and they would tell him not to worry about it, just worry about playing hockey. \" johnson, who didn't realize things were awry until earlier this year, is reportedly now estranged from his parents.

        "summary": "When sonia vallabh watched her mother die a horrible death in 2010, caught in limbo between sleep and wakefulness that led to severe dementia, she and her husband, eric minikel, wanted answers. The autopsy revealed a harrowing diagnosis: a prion disease called fatal familial insomnia, or ffi, reports the boston globe. Not long thereafter, vallabh, then in her 20s, learned that she carried the genetic mutation as well. The tiny error in her mother's dna — an a where there should have been a g that resulted in a clumping of proteins that killed brain cells and prevented her from falling asleep — lives in vallabh, reports npr. The disease usually rears its head around age 50, though it has surfaced as early as 12; vallabh's mother died at 51. And it moves fast: \" you're healthy and then you're falling off a cliff, \" says vallabh. To avoid another early death, they decided to find a cure themselves. The two had finished grad school in unrelated fields, but enrolled in night classes for biology and neuroscience. Today, they're both doctoral students at a harvard and mit lab, trying to find a way to prevent those proteins from misfolding, or from accumulating in the first place, and to have vallabh, whose brain is producing what her husband calls a \" mutant protein, \" be a part of the early experiments. Their lab professor tells the harvard gazette they bring \" otherworldly intellect \" and a \" heavy dose of urgency \" to their work, and they've already been able to stop the disease in their family. Vallabh is due with their first child in july, a girl who does not carry the genetic mutation because they chose ivf and screened embryos. Vallabh says it's \" tragic \" her daughter and mother won't meet, but her mother's death helped give her daughter a life without the disease. ( this doctor is also studying his own disease. )",

Top advertising agency dentsu faces charges of violating labor standards related to illegal overtime in the case of matsuri takahashi, 24, who threw herself from one of the company's dorms on christmas day 2015. Prosecutors were seeking a fine in the case but did not plan to charge any individuals, the kyodo agency reports via the bbc. Takahashi's suicide made global headlines, prompted the resignation of dentsu's ceo, and led to calls to reform the country's rabid culture of long hours and unpaid overtime. There are several hundred cases of japanese workers dying each year from \" karoshi, \" or overwork, per the bbc. But the unofficial death toll is believed to be much higher. In the time before she died, takahashi, who worked at dentsu for less than a year, was said to have slept just 10 hours a week and clocked more than 100 hours of overtime per month. Her desperate final tweets included: \" it's 4am. My body's trembling.

The attackers wanted demario's jacket, his aunt tells the chicago sun-times. Seeing demacio attacked by one of the robbers, demario came to his aid, shoving the attacker off his brother — but demacio soon heard a gunshot, a police report says. He ran away, believing his brother was behind him, but he wasn't, the boys ' grandmother tells the chicago tribune. Going back, demacio found his brother shot; he was pronounced dead within minutes, the police report says. Seventeen-year-old carlos johnson has been charged with murder, and three other suspects have also been arrested, the tribune reports. The boys went to school in chicago's dangerous englewood neighborhood. Normally, they were picked up and dropped off, but \" they were starting to say, 'ma, we can do things on our own, ' \" their grandmother says. \" we promised them we would give them a little more freedom. \" yesterday, classmates gathered to remember demario as a loving brother and friend. He was days from his 16th birthday, the sun-times reports. \" he truly embodied the motto, ' i am my brother's keeper, ' \" not just to demacio, but to his community, says a history teacher. The attack spurred the school's founding principal to call for action against violence, saying the area can feel like a \" war zone \" and that she wouldn't mind \" if it takes ( martial ) law to get this in order. \" ( indeed, one night this summer, some 21 people were shot in chicago on a single night, many on the south side, home to englewood. )",

Butler, who has been released without charges, got stopped when screeners found a metal canister in his bag. The discovery prompted a bomb scare, but fbi tests revealed nothing dangerous. However, butler's previous case, once featured on 60 minutes, raised alarms: he first got in hot water with the feds in 2003 when he reported the theft of 30 vials of plague samples from his texas tech lab. Then it gets confusing, but he ended up serving 2 years in prison for, as ap puts it, \" the mislabeling and unauthorized export of a fedex package that contained plague samples he sent to tanzania. \" fellow scientists defended him throughout the case.

In addition to the reinstated $ 200,000 initiation fee, members must also pay $ 14,000 in annual dues ( plus tax on the whole deal ). But while one ethics watchdog rep calls the increased fee an \" unacceptable \" development that \" demeans \" the presidency, lembcke tells the times that plans for this price boost were put in place before the election.

Wait, what? that's what researchers from stanford, cambridge, and beyond report in a study they've titled, \" frankly, we do give a damn: the relationship between profanity and honesty, \" in the journal social psychological and personality science. They ultimately found that swearing is used more as a means to express emotion than as an anti-social tool to harm or disparage others, and thus those who swear more tend to be allowing their true selves to shine through, reports indy100. To test this, the team first surveyed a group of 276 people about their swearing habits and levels of honesty, and found that people who curse the most tend to be the most honest. To get past the reliance on self reporting, the researchers then analyzed the status updates of more than 73,000 facebook users, measuring both profanity and honesty based on previous research showing that liars tend to write in the third person and deploy more negative words, reports medical daily. They then compared that same data with integrity levels among us states. \" the consistent findings across the studies suggest that the positive relation between profanity and honesty is robust, and that the relationship found at the individual level indeed translates to the society level, \" the researchers write.

They first asked a group of 276 participants about their swearing habits, as well as how honest they were in different situations, and found the most honest people were also the heaviest swearers. They also found that people were much more likely to use swearing as a way to express themselves and their emotions, rather than in an anti-social or harmful way towards others. In a second study the researchers tested these findings in a more real-life setting, by analysing the status updates of more than 73,000 facebook users. They measured for honesty ( previous research shows liars prefer to use third-person pronouns than first-person ones and more negative words ) and profanity. Again, they found that honest people were more likely to use profane language. Then, they used previous data to compare the integrity levels of us states with how often they swear – where",
            "Swearing may be considered impolite and vulgar, but a new two-part study has revealed a more gracious attribute for those with an off-color vocabulary: honesty. According to the research, people are more likely to swear as a way to express themselves, rather than cause harm to others, and the more an individual swears, the more honest they are likely to be. The researchers found that while liars are known to prefer third-person pronouns and negative words in their speech, honest individuals are more likely to use profanity. According to the researchers, that's because swearing is often used to express one's feelings, and people who do this more regularly portray themselves in a more honest light, the independent reported. Read: how swear words work to inflict and relieve pain \"the consistent findings across the studies suggest that the positive relation between profanity and honesty is robust, and that the relationship found at the individual level indeed translates to the society level, \" the study read. For their report, the team of international researchers asked a group of 276 participants about their swearing habits as well as how honest they were in different situations. In addition, they analyzed the status updates of more than 73,000 facebook users, measuring for honesty and profanity. In the second study, the same team used previous data to compare"

        "summary": "Police are reopening an investigation into one of britain's most notorious scandals because a main suspect who was thought to have died may be alive. The decision is the latest twist in the story of former liberal party leader jeremy thorpe, who was accused of plotting to kill his gay ex-lover norman scott in the 1970s, per the ap. The bbc first reported the development. In 1975, scott was driven to a remote rural spot by a man who fatally shot scott's great dane, rinka, in what scott said was a botched murder attempt. Scott maintained he had had an affair with thorpe in the 1960s, when homosexuality was illegal in britain, and that the liberal lawmaker — one of the era's biggest political stars — wanted to silence him. Andrew newton, an airline pilot, was convicted of firearms offenses over the shooting of the dog. When he was released from jail in 1977, newton said he had been hired to kill scott and implicated thorpe and three other men in the plot. Thorpe and the three others were tried and acquitted of conspiracy to murder in 1979. Thorpe's political career was ruined, and he stayed out of the public eye until his death in 2014. New information led gwent police to reopen the investigation in 2015, but they closed it last year after concluding newton was dead. But the force told the bbc it had \" identified information which indicates that mr. Newton may still be alive. \" no details were provided. The case is back in the spotlight thanks to the miniseries a very english scandal, which stars hugh grant as thorpe and ben whishaw as scott.",

Berlusconi faces a critical budget vote today that could expose how little support he has. Opposition lawmakers plan to let the budget pass but skip voting in protest — and at least five members of berlusconi's pdl are joining them. Berlusconi will meet with at least one of those defectors today, according to the wall street journal. \"i want to look my traitors in the face, \" he was quoted as saying. If the final vote today comes up with less than 310 backing the prime minister — and early estimates indicate it ' ll be well below that — the pressure for him to resign will be immense, with a no-confidence vote likely this week.",

A patch of green bacteria encased in a round glass dish sold for that sum to an unnamed buyer at a london auction on wednesday, the ap reports. The furry sample's case is signed on the back by alexander fleming, the scientist who sourced the world's first life-saving antibiotic from penicillium chrysogenum in 1928. His inscription describes this sample as \" the mould that first made penicillin \" — which may not quite be so, the ap notes, since the scottish-born doctor produced many such medallions. The payday for fleming's niece, who sold the sample, was substantially higher than the predicted sale price of $ 5,000. But it may have been a relative bargain for the buyer. Pfizer paid many times that — $ 51,000 in today's dollars — in 1996 for a similar blob, quartz reports. Once thought to be rare, it turns out many samples exist, made by fleming and gifted to notables such as winston churchill, pope pius xii, and marlene dietrich \" almost as a kind of holy relic, \" a rep for bonham's auction house tells the ap. Not everyone was happy to receive one. Queen elizabeth's husband reportedly griped about getting \" another one of these bloody things, \" notes quartz. More bits of trivia: smithsonian reports fleming made \" microbial art paintings, \" and the ap reports that after oxford scientists refined fleming's discovery, penicillin production was put into high gear in preparation for d-day in 1944.

The sick mammal was given fluids and medicine, then began vomiting plastic friday and \" struggled fiercely \" to purge what it could, per the thaiwhales facebook page.

Marine biologist thon thamrongnawasawat said the bags then prevented the creature from ingesting anything nutritional, the guardian reports. \" if you have 80 plastic bags in your stomach, you die, \" he explained.

        "summary": "A disturbing study says the world's wild animal population has plunged 58 % since 1970, the bbc reports. Researchers from the wwf and the zoological society of london warn that if current trends continue, two-thirds of the world's wildlife will be gone by 2020. The finger points squarely at humans, who cause climate change, pollution, habitat loss, hunting, and illegal trafficking. \" we know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations — it really is now down to us to act, \" says dr. Mike barrett of the wwf. \" now we've reached a point where there isn't really any excuse to let this carry on. \" in the most comprehensive assessment of its kind, the living planet report analyzed 3,700 vertebrate species and found that decimation included a wide range of them: from african elephants devastated by poaching to vultures to salamanders. Animals living in rivers and lakes were most at risk, with their decline pegged at 81 %. But the living planet is taking criticism from some, including a duke ecologist who cites a lack of data \" from south america, from tropical africa, there is not much from the tropics, period. They're trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number.... It's flawed. \" the report underscores the effects of the anthropocene, a suggested geological era that finds humans dominating the planet, reports the guardian. \" we are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point, \" the report says. Barrett says saving animals and ensuring biodiversity depends on enforcing sustainable environmental policies and simpler acts such as consuming fewer resources including meat. There is good news: species like tigers and the giant panda have rallied; the latter was recently removed from the endangered list.",

South korea requires men to serve 21 months in the military before the age of 30 — or before the age of 27 if they live abroad, as is the case with son. However, athletes can get an exemption, provided they're successful. Those who bring home an olympic medal of any kind get the break, as do those who win gold at the asian games.

            "The american ideal of lazy summers filled with fun has an unintended consequence: if students are not engaged in learning over the summer, they lose skills in math and reading. Summers off are one of the most important, yet least acknowledged, causes of underachievement in our schools. Decades of research confirm that summer learning loss is real. According to a report released last month by the rand corporation, the average summer learning loss in math and reading for american students amounts to one month per year. More troubling is that it disproportionately affects low-income students: they lose two months of reading skills, while their higher-income peers — whose parents can send them to enriching camps, take them on educational vacations and surround them with books during the summer — make slight gains. A study from johns hopkins university of students in baltimore found that about two-thirds of the achievement gap between lower- and higher-income ninth graders could be explained by summer learning loss during the elementary school years. This learning loss is cumulative, summer after summer. It has a tremendous impact on students'success, including high school completion, post-secondary education and work force preparedness. As a result, no matter how effective other school reforms are, our traditional 180-day school calendar creates an incredibly inefficient system of learning. We cannot afford to spend nearly 10 months of every",
            "This waste is preventable. According to the rand report, good summer programs with individualized instruction, parental involvement and small classes can keep children from falling behind and reduce the achievement gap. Photo yet many districts, including new york city, have not fully embraced the summer's potential.

            "The american ideal of lazy summers filled with fun has an unintended consequence: if students are not engaged in learning over the summer, they lose skills in math and reading. Summers off are one of the most important, yet least acknowledged, causes of underachievement in our schools. Decades of research confirm that summer learning loss is real. According to a report released last month by the rand corporation, the average summer learning loss in math and reading for american students amounts to one month per year. More troubling is that it disproportionately affects low-income students: they lose two months of reading skills, while their higher-income peers — whose parents can send them to enriching camps, take them on educational vacations and surround them with books during the summer — make slight gains. A study from johns hopkins university of students in baltimore found that about two-thirds of the achievement gap between lower- and higher-income ninth graders could be explained by summer learning loss during the elementary school years. This learning loss is cumulative, summer after summer. It has a tremendous impact on students'success, including high school completion, post-secondary education and work force preparedness. As a result, no matter how effective other school reforms are, our traditional 180-day school calendar creates an incredibly inefficient system of learning. We cannot afford to spend nearly 10 months of every",
            "This waste is preventable. According to the rand report, good summer programs with individualized instruction, parental involvement and small classes can keep children from falling behind and reduce the achievement gap. Photo yet many districts, including new york city, have not fully embraced the summer's potential.

After two chemicals from freedom industries leaked into the elk river around jan. 9, about 300,000 local residents were quickly told not to drink the water running through their pipes. It has since been deemed safe. Dr. Scott simonton, who led the team that found the formaldehyde, says it's probably a byproduct of a chemical that leaked, the charleston daily mail reports. He says he's still not drinking or cooking with the water, the charleston gazette reports. \" what we know scares us, and we know there's a lot more we don't know, \" simonton told lawmakers today, noting that formaldehyde is not safe to drink or breathe. \" frankly, the formaldehyde has me, personally, a little freaked out. \" the tainted sample came from a restaurant in downtown charleston, the first area \" cleared \" by the water company and told it could start flushing its pipes on jan. 13. Simonton doesn't think the flushing period was long enough, and that the chemical is still sticking to pipes. He also noted, \" i can guarantee you that the citizens of this valley are at least in some instances breathing formaldehyde, \" likely while showering.",
