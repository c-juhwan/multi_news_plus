The journal news reports 70-year-old mary edwards of port chester filed a lawsuit monday in state supreme court against dr. Eric fishman and his employer, westmed medical group. Fishman performed surgery on edwards to fix varicose veins twice in 2017. According to the lawsuit, edwards claims fishman had a conversation in spanish on his cellphone during the second outpatient procedure. She says she also heard him mention something into the phone about having diabetes and blurred vision. Edwards ' attorney says his client was terrified for the rest of the operation because she feared those vision issues would somehow mar her procedure. Edwards claims fishman later explained he was taking a spanish proficiency test during the surgery ( meaning he wasn't really suffering from vision problems ). She says he told her he needed to be certified in spanish due to his many spanish-speaking patients and that there was no other good time to take the test. The procedure turned out ok, but edwards says she suffered emotional distress as a result of the incident. She's seeking unspecified monetary damages. A westmed spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on pending litigation.",

But the president also made headlines with his statement about the proposed keystone oil pipeline: he promised to kill the project if studies showed it would \" significantly \" worsen greenhouse gas emissions. He did not, however, spell out what he means by \" significantly, \" which helps explain why both \" opponents and backers of the pipeline found support for their positions in his remarks, \" reports the new york times. Politico, however, suggests that those who want the pipeline built should be happiest because of what the president didn't mention: \" his own state department has already indicated that the pipeline can meet that standard. \" ( that finding was in a draft report; the final version is due soon. ) tilting the balance a bit more toward the pipeline getting a green light: the canadian government and oil industry, along with keystone operator transcanada were pleased with the president's remarks, reports wall street journal.

Such imports of overseas sperm have spiked over the last several years, and although same-sex couples still make up the majority of buyers, lesbian couples and affluent, single career women ( a group npr has deemed part of a \" demographic shift \" ) are increasingly scooping up foreign sperm. Brazilian buyers look for \" caucasian blond-haired, blue-eyed donors, \" per an exec with a seattle cryobank. The reason: most brazilians are black or mixed race, but the ruling elite are often white; parents-to-be think whiteness will give kids a better shot at high-salary jobs and other perks. Women in brazil also like that a lot more information comes with us donors than with resident ones: one woman who has a toddler with an american donor tells the journal she received nearly 30 pages of background on him, while info on a local donor might consist of little more than \" brown eyes, brown hair, likes hamburgers. \" imported sperm doesn't come cheap. \" genetically vetted \" us samples can run $ 1,500 a vial, which is just a portion of the larger in vitro process that can cost upward of $ 7,000.

It will be a big part of the police investigation into the tamir rice case, but as of now, there are no plans to make the video public. Cleveland police chief calvin williams said today that the youth had an air gun \" indistinguishable from a real gun \" when police arrived at a city recreation center. A caller had reported a man with a gun, but he also told the dispatcher that it might be a juvenile and that the gun might be fake. It's not clear whether that information got relayed to the responding officer, said another police official, reports the plain dealer. \" there's no time a cleveland police officer wants to shoot a kid and that's how the officer feels, \" said williams. The officer was about 10 feet away when he shot tamir. Police have said the boy was reaching for the gun and disregarding orders to put his hands up. Still, the boy's father thinks police could have tased his son rather than shooting him dead, and the hacker group anonymous agrees. It shut down the city website this morning and criticized both the cop who shot tamir and the city police department for a \" lack of appropriate training, \" reports the daily news.",

And like the pyramids, the resulting site in northeastern brazil is visible from space today. But there was no ramp or pulley, or even manpower. Rather, as entomologist stephen martin explains in a post at phys.org, the complex of 200 million large mounds of dirt covering an area the size of great britain \" represents one of the biggest structures built by a single insect species. \" he's referring to termites. The cone-shaped mounds are up to 10 feet high and 30 feet wide, and spaced about 60 feet apart, per quartz. Scientists date the oldest of them to 3,820 years ago, making them about the same age as the world's oldest known termite mounds in africa, reports cnn. As a point of reference, they say the excavated dirt would fill 4,000 great pyramids of giza. The mounds were formed as one of the world's largest termite species, syntermes dirus, \" excavated a massive network of tunnels \" to reach meals of dead leaves when they fell to the forest floor once a year, martin says. The tunnels allow termites to cover a lot of ground quickly while providing protection. Note the present tense, as researchers say some mounds remain in use over 88,800 square miles. \" it's incredible that, in this day and age, you can find an ' unknown ' biological wonder of this sheer size and age still existing, with the occupants still present, \" says martin, whose study was published monday in current biology. Interestingly, though gizmodo notes the termites can be aggressive, researchers found little evidence of aggression in the mounds, suggesting a cohesive colony.

The mounds are the work of a single species: syntermes dirus, one of the largest termites in the world. The cone-shaped piles, each spaced about 60 feet apart, are what's left behind when the insects burrow tunnels in the soil beneath the dry tropical forest. Some of the mounds are still in use. Radioactive dating found that the oldest piles were 3,820",
            "Image: roy funch scientists have discovered an immense grouping of freakishly large termite mounds in northeastern brazil. Obscured by trees, the previously undetected array occupies a space equal to the size of great britain. As described in a new paper published today in current biology, the regularly spaced termite mounds date back nearly 4,000 years and cover an astounding 230,000 square kilometers ( 88,800 square miles ) of dry tropical forest in a relatively undisturbed region of northeastern brazil. The mounds, measuring around 2.5 meters ( 8.2 feet ) tall and 9 meters ( 30 feet ) wide, took thousands of years to build by an untold number of termites, all of which belong to the"

Lawmakers there today voted to join russia, and set a march 16 referendum in which the crimean people will be offered the same choice. One lawmaker put it plainly to the ap: \" this is our response to the disorder and lawlessness in kiev. We will decide our future ourselves. \" the crimean parliament voted 78-0 ( with eight abstentions ) \" to enter into the russian federation with the rights of a subject of the russian federation, \" reports reuters, which cites diplomats as saying today's developments could not have occurred without the ok of vladimir putin. A kremlin rep says only that putin had been made aware of the crimean vote, and crimean parliament sources say lawmakers are waiting for moscow to respond, per the bbc. Ukraine's interim government says the referendum is illegal, and has launched a criminal investigation into crimea's prime minister. Meanwhile: the eu is holding an emergency session on ukraine in brussels today and has made moves to \" punish \" viktor yanukovich, reports the new york times: all assets of yanukovich, two of his sons, and 15 members of his inner circle held on european soil have been frozen. The eu suspects all 18 of \" the embezzlement of ukrainian state funds and their illegal transfer outside ukraine, \" the los angeles times notes. The white house today hit pro-russian opponents to ukraine's new government with new visa restrictions, the ap reports. The restrictions target those accused of threatening ukraine's sovereignty and borders, and financial sanctions are coming next.

But in chilling footage from a china mall where a mom fell through such a panel to her death, two mall employees are seen minutes before the deadly incident nearly falling through the panel themselves — and doing nothing to stop the escalator, per the hong kong free press. The director of the local work-safety authority said monday night that five minutes before xiang liujuan fell into the gap, mall workers had discovered the loose panel but didn't turn the escalator off, shanghai daily reports. Maintenance had just been performed on the escalator and workers apparently failed to screw the panel cover back on, per the mirror. The new surveillance footage shows one employee riding down one floor on the escalator, then back up to meet her co-worker standing on the flawed panel. When she reaches the top, the panel \" tilts up on one side, \" per the free press, and the two quickly step to safety. \" there is a problem, here. [ we ] almost fell down, \" one is heard saying to the other, per the paper. They can be seen briefly leaving the scene, reportedly to alert management, then returning to stand sentinel; one of them even reaches her foot out to carefully test the panel. Minutes later, xiang and her toddler appear at the bottom of the escalator, which the workers never thought to halt. The los angeles times reports by way of local media that a worker told xiang to \" jump over \" the faulty panel; xiang picks up the child and steps over the first panel but onto the loose one — the second one — and falls into the machinery.",

He says that after he asked how to file a complaint, supervisor charles kieser summoned police, and vanderklok ended up locked in holding cells for nearly 24 hours, unable to contact his wife, who was frantically searching for him. \" it's difficult to lose control of your existence. That's what it amounts to, \" he tells the ap. \" i was absolutely terrified. \" vanderklok was eventually charged with \" threatening the placement of a bomb \" and making \" terroristic threats, \" but when the case went to court in april 2013, a judge acquitted him on the spot after hearing kieser's testimony, the philadelphia daily news reports. The supervisor claimed that vanderklok had become agitated, jabbed a finger in his face repeatedly, and said he could \" bring a bomb through here any day. \" but surveillance footage showed that vanderklok stood calmly throughout the encounter, and according to a police report, kieser originally said a frustrated vanderklok told him \" anybody could bring a bomb in here. \" vanderklok says he didn't make either statement.

Just two miles north-east of the world heritage site, at an important archaeological complex known as durrington walls, archaeologists have just discovered what appears to have been a vast 500-metre diameter circle of giant timber posts. The find is of international significance. Durrington walls excavation originally archaeologists, using geophysics rather than excavation, had thought that they had found buried standing stones, so the discovery has totally changed their understanding of the site – the largest ancient monument of its type in britain. However, the most significant revelation is the discovery that the newly identified timber circle complex was probably never fully completed – and that, just a few months or years after construction had started, there was a dramatic change in religious – and therefore almost certainly also political – direction. Work on the circle was stopped abruptly by around 2460bc – despite the fact that it was nearing completion. The 200-300 giant 6-7 metre long, 60-70 centimetre diameter timber posts were lifted vertically out of their 1.5 metre deep post holes – and were probably used to construct or expand other parts of the complex.

            "Last year archeologists discovered \" superhenge \", or what was thought to be around 90 stone monolithic structures buried a meter below ground, just a few kilometers northeast of the stonehenge in wiltshire, england. The blocks were over 4,500 years old. It turns out, however, that the circular superhenge was actually made of timber, and that it was hurriedly taken down. The research team that made this discovery hypothesize that the superhenge might have been constructed and deconstructed during a tumultuous time, rife with political or religious conflict. Geophysical survey techniques allowed scientists to first discover superhenge and conclude that each monolith was organized in a circle with a diameter of about 500 meters. They did not actually, however, excavate the site. Now a recent excavation of the superhenge site has revealed that the standing monoliths were neither standing, nor stone, nor even monolithic. These structures are actually giant pits that once contained wooden posts. \" the response from the radar was so good that the team thought they were dealing with a whole series of stones lying on their side, buried beneath the bank of this ancient earthwork, \" nick snashall, uk national trust archeologist, told the bbc.

Durrington walls excavation originally archaeologists, using geophysics rather than excavation, had thought that they had found buried standing stones, so the discovery has totally changed their understanding of the site – the largest ancient monument of its type in britain. However, the most significant revelation is the discovery that the newly identified timber circle complex was probably never fully completed – and that, just a few months or years after construction had started, there was a dramatic change in religious – and therefore almost certainly also political – direction. Work on the circle was stopped abruptly by around 2460bc – despite the fact that it was nearing completion. The 200-300 giant 6-7 metre long, 60-70 centimetre diameter timber posts were lifted vertically out of their 1.5 metre deep post holes – and were probably used to construct or expand other parts of the complex.

            "Last year archeologists discovered \" superhenge \", or what was thought to be around 90 stone monolithic structures buried a meter below ground, just a few kilometers northeast of the stonehenge in wiltshire, england. The blocks were over 4,500 years old. It turns out, however, that the circular superhenge was actually made of timber, and that it was hurriedly taken down. The research team that made this discovery hypothesize that the superhenge might have been constructed and deconstructed during a tumultuous time, rife with political or religious conflict. Geophysical survey techniques allowed scientists to first discover superhenge and conclude that each monolith was organized in a circle with a diameter of about 500 meters. They did not actually, however, excavate the site. Now a recent excavation of the superhenge site has revealed that the standing monoliths were neither standing, nor stone, nor even monolithic. These structures are actually giant pits that once contained wooden posts. \" the response from the radar was so good that the team thought they were dealing with a whole series of stones lying on their side, buried beneath the bank of this ancient earthwork, \" nick snashall, uk national trust archeologist, told the bbc. So far two of the pits have been excavated, officially disproving the stone theory. \" what we've discovered are that there are two"

The origins of the \" triple-double \" aren't iron-clad, but the phrase is widely attributed to harvey pollack, dubbed the \" basketball's godfather of statistical analysis \" by bloomberg in its 2015 obituary of pollack, who is said to have started using the term during magic johnson's 1979-1980 rookie season.",

Nine men have been arrested in the attack, and the un has condemned the brutality, reports cnn. But a new york times account of the incident has a more powerful condemnation than the un statement. It came from a young woman who confronted men at the scene yesterday, one day after the attack: ' \" you are all men, and you say you are the protectors of women,'she said loudly. With tears streaming down her face and holding a bright handbag of pink, green and blue, she continued: ' but you let her die in a brutal way! you're not better than animals.

The older girl, for example, seemed to be chewing a lump of coca when she died. Much more is known about her, relatively speaking. Researchers think she was a peasant girl selected for sacrifice about a year before her death, and she received special treatment during that time, reports the christian science monitor. She \" became somebody other than who she was before, \" says the lead uk author. \" her sacrifice was seen as an honor. \" hair samples show that she switched from a diet of potatoes to a much richer one in her final year, and her consumption of coca leaves and alcohol spiked.

        "summary": "Smoking dope doesn't actually make you a dope. That's the takeaway from a new study on hundreds of pairs of twins — one of whom smoked pot as an adolescent and continued for over 10 years while the other abstained. Though a 2012 study linked marijuana use with a decline in iq, critics say it failed to account for certain factors. Hoping to avoid such complaints, scientists at ucla and the university of minnesota reviewed data from 789 pairs of twins. They found marijuana users lost about four iq points over time, but their twins showed a similar decline, reports science. When it came to an apparent decrease in a marijuana user's vocabulary and information ability, the alteration was reduced or \" completely eliminated \" when researchers adjusted for a participant's reported binge drinking and use of other drugs including tobacco, which may affect cognitive development, per meta. Researchers also found no link between heavier or more frequent marijuana use and greater iq decline. This fails to back up the notion that \" marijuana exposure in adolescence causes neurocognitive decline, \" researchers say, per the washington post. Instead, it suggests \" children who are predisposed to intellectual stagnation in middle school are on a trajectory for future marijuana use. \" a british researcher says she reached \" broadly the same conclusions \" in a recent study of 2,235 adolescent brits. \" cannabis use by the age of 15 did not predict either lower teenage iq scores or poorer educational performance, \" researchers noted in that study, concluding that modest cannabis use \" is not by itself causally related to cognitive impairment. \" critics say the american study did not properly question adolescents on their marijuana use.

The travelers had experienced their share of controversy. In one case two years ago, gamble and lyakh spent a week in jail in wyoming for disorderly conduct after photos showed they'd ventured to a hot spring in a protected area of yellowstone national park. In one of his last instagram posts, gamble gave a glimpse at the mindset that allowed for such adventures. \" life isn't about responsibilities, tough decisions, and hard work, it's about feeling bliss and living in the moment, \" he said, per the cbc. \" to know that he passed away doing what he loved gives me some comfort, \" a friend tells global news.

        "summary": "More than half a million southerners have been left without power after major sleet and snow that left north carolina drivers stranded on icy roads yesterday — and now that storm system could bring more than a foot of snow to parts of the northeast, the ap reports. In fact, forecasters are saying this could be the worst storm of the season so far for the already storm-weary northeast. The latest: the philadelphia area could see a foot or more of snow; washington, dc, and boston are expecting about 8 inches; new york city is looking at 6 inches. ( cnn has the much more alarming forecast of as many as 15 inches in new york. ) in dc, the storm has shut down the federal government, schools, bus service, and both area airports, the washington post reports. ( philadelphia and new york are experiencing similar closures. ) more than 4,400 flights have been canceled across the us today; more than 3,400 were canceled yesterday. The weather has been blamed in at least 12 deaths in the south, including a number of traffic accidents and one man in georgia who spent hours outside and died of hypothermia. Much of the south was plagued with icy roads, including georgia, where state troopers saw more than 200 crashes. At least seven georgians were hospitalized — in sledding accidents. President obama declared a disaster in parts of georgia and south carolina. Some of the more than 545,000 homes and businesses that lost electricity in the south could be without power for days. The northeast is also expecting prolonged power outages. All in all, the latest count is more than 772,000 customers without power across 14 states and the district of columbia.",

        "summary": "Satellite images taken before and after north korea's last nuclear test beneath mount mantap show the mountain actually lost elevation. As the washington post reports, the depression of a 85-acre area — followed by three subsequent earthquakes over six weeks — shows not only the force of the sept. 3 blast, but also the toll north korea's nuclear program has taken on the 7,200-foot-tall mountain. It houses the tunnels that make up the punggye-ri nuclear test facility, which has been the site of each of north korea's six nuclear tests since 2006. Chinese scientists warn further nuclear tests could trigger a collapse and the release of radiation. But though analysts at 38 north say mount mantap may be suffering from \" tired mountain syndrome, \" they say north korea is unlikely to abandon the site any time soon. \" tired mountain syndrome \" has previously been observed at other nuclear test sites in the us and soviet union. It essentially means a mountain is under such stress that the collapse of cavities or tunnels is possible. In north korea's case, the sept. 3 blast is likely to have caused \" substantial damage to the existing tunnel network under mount mantap, \" analysts say. But as there are \" two other, as yet unused tunnel complexes \" at punggye-ri, the analysts believe underground nuclear tests will likely continue. Indeed, cia director mike pompeo tells the bbc that north korea is \" on the cusp \" of developing a nuclear missile capable of reaching the us as it presses australia to distance itself from the us in a letter published by the sydney morning herald.",

Now, we've found a twitter account registered to that same e-mail address: mckinely777, which is listed under the name \"sarah. \" what does sarah palin use her secret twitter account for? pretty much just to follow her other twitter account. She ' ll do anything to increase that follower count and seem more popular, we guess. Or she just really likes herself. Both? by the time we got to the mckinely777 account last night, it hadn't posted any tweets, or they had been scrubbed before we got there. The account followed sarahpalinusa first, of course.

Please know that this is my only authentic facebook account and sarahpalinusa is my only authentic twitter account. Pay no attention to the fake accounts and their fake messages. At the time, nobody in the press was accusing her of having a personal twitter account, just a personal facebook account. So this seems like it was a preemptive move to deny the existence of a personal twitter account that would eventually surface. Which makes sense, because even though we never mentioned it in our earlier posts, palin's people knew we knew there was a twitter account registered to her personal e-mail address. Last monday night, after we plugged the e-mail address into facebook, we went to twitter. Twitter lets you see if there are accounts registered to the e-mail addresses in your e-mail contacts.

            "Last week, we brought you the news that sarah palin had a secret facebook account registered to her personal gmail address, which was mistakenly revealed in her ex-aide frank bailey's book transcript. Now, we've found a twitter account registered to that same e-mail address: mckinely777, which is listed under the name \"sarah. \" what does sarah palin use her secret twitter account for? pretty much just to follow her other twitter account. She ' ll do anything to increase that follower count and seem more popular, we guess. Or she just really likes herself. Both? by the time we got to the mckinely777 account last night, it hadn't posted any tweets, or they had been scrubbed before we got there. The account followed sarahpalinusa first, of course. It also follows the drudge report and newt gingrich. It didn't have any followers of its own when we came across it. But really, who would follow a dummy account that only exists to follow sarahpalinusa? in retrospect, it does seem kind of strange that the non-denial denial palin posted on facebook on wednesday mentioned \"fake \" twitter accounts: on a side note, there's always buzz about fake sarah palin facebook and twitter accounts. Please know that this is my only authentic facebook account and sarahpalinusa is my only authentic twitter account. Pay no attention to the fake accounts and their fake messages. At the time, nobody in the press was accusing her of having a personal twitter account, just a personal facebook account. So this seems like it was a preemptive move to deny the existence of a personal twitter account that would eventually surface. Which makes sense, because even though we never mentioned it in our earlier posts, palin's people knew we knew there was a twitter account registered to her personal e-mail address. Last monday night, after we plugged the e-mail address into facebook, we went to twitter. Twitter lets you see if there are accounts registered to the e-mail addresses in your e-mail contacts. So we added the palin gmail to our contacts and were able to see that she had an account, but we weren't able to see what it was. Twitter will"

        "summary": "Imagine sharing every one of your conversations with the world. A young woman does this voluntarily when she finds a job with a social media corporation bent on erasing privacy in the circle, an adaptation of dave eggers ' 2013 novel of the same name. Critics, who give it a 20 % rating on rotten tomatoes, might prefer to erase the flick from their memory. Here's what they're saying: \" our gradual, voluntary loss of privacy is ripe for dramatization, but this movie arrives when people are actually backing up from social media, \" writes sara stewart at the new york post. It doesn't help that it \" feels like the brainchild of middle-aged guys … who still think of facebook as cutting edge. \" stewart adds emma watson is all wrong in the role of mae, appearing too smart \" to make you believe she'd buy this facile sub-orwellian shtick. \" \" there's certainly a good, smart idea there … but it remains an idea — not an emotion, and barely a movie, \" writes stephen whitty at the newark star-ledger. His main gripe is with the characters: mae never lets the audience know her true feelings, while her boss, the supposed villain played by tom hanks, \" never seems remotely threatening, \" he writes. \" it leaves us with a story that progresses without deepening, that ends without climaxing. \" robert abele says the film \" never builds up a head of steam as either dark drama, modern satire or dystopian thriller. \" mostly, it's \" a middling, choppily edited mess, \" he writes at the los angeles times, concluding \" the circle is like a buggy app, something you want to work but is doomed to be remembered more as a missed opportunity than a memorably cautionary message for our times. \" but owen gleiberman disagrees. The circle is \" not necessarily a movie you can warm up to \" given its alarming subject matter. But it remains \" a swankly sinister little mind teaser \" and \" a cautionary tale for the age of social-media witch hunts and compulsive oversharing, \" he writes at variety. It also has \" an elegant and original look \" and in watson, an actress that proves \" she can hold a film together with the force of her personality. \" ( the film was bill paxton's final role. )",

Now, the bedford sheriff's office says, \" additional leads \" developed through \" investigative interviews \" have prompted more digging. The case got media attention last month when court documents stated that lloyd welch, 58, a convicted sex offender, had linked the abduction to his 69-year-old uncle richard, a property owner on taylor's mountain, the huffington post reports. Lloyd apparently said he'd joined richard and a cousin in abducting the girls by car, and saw richard having \" intercourse with one of the lyon sisters \" the next day; but lloyd said he \" never saw the lyon sisters again \" and didn't help in \" killing those girls. \" no one's been charged, but a search warrant says lloyd told a fellow delaware inmate that he'd abducted sheila, 12, and katherine, 10, before burying them in virginia on property owned by the family.

What's more, the canadian unemployment rate has dropped to 7.2 %, while over here we're stuck at 8.2 %. In short, \" the canadian system is working; the american system is not, \" writes stephen marche in bloomberg. Why? it's not just canada's natural resources: it's good economic policy. Canada's trick is a sort of \" hardheaded socialism, \" combing the ideas of left and right. The country's success can be traced back to 1990s finance minister paul martin, who was strict on banks — forbidding them, for example, from merging. He also cut social programs as well as corporate taxes. Canadians have an \" obsession with order \" that has served them well, even if its ideas might not fit into any particular ideological mold.

        "summary": "More background but no answers in the case of yesterday's shooting at fort hood: the army today confirmed that the gunman worked as a truck driver in iraq from august to december 2011. He saw no combat, and the ap reports that his service record contains no mention of a purple heart, indicating he was never injured on the job. Those records show \" no direct involvement in combat... Or any injury that might lead us to further investigate battle-related tbi ( traumatic brain injury ), \" said army secretary john mchugh today. Gunman ivan lopez did, however, \" self-report \" a tbi. More: house homeland security committee chair michael mccaul has confirmed the gunman's identity as lopez, but military officials are still declining to do so, pending notification of his family. There's someone else not using his name: fox news ' megyn kelly. Politico reports that she has made it a policy not to use his name, or that of any other mass killer, on the kelly file; her guests, which today included mccaul, refrained from using his name as well. \" too often it is infamy they seek, \" she said, \" and we decline to help. \" what mchugh did disclose about the shooter: he's a puerto rico native who joined the island's national guard in 1999 and served on a yearlong peace-keeping mission in egypt's sinai peninsula in the mid-2000s. He then enlisted with the army in 2008. Mchugh also said the shooter saw a psychiatrist last month and showed no \" sign of any likely violence either to himself or others. \" further, his record shows \" no involvement with extremist organizations of any kind, \" though the army isn't ruling out extremist ties. As for the.45-caliber smith &amp; wesson handgun lopez used, cnn reports it was bought legally near killeen, texas; the gun store followed procedure, and there were no red flags. Lopez had not been diagnosed with ptsd, but was going through the steps required to arrive at such a diagnosis. Among the drugs he had been prescribed: the sleep aid ambien. Though the three critically injured victims remain on ventilators, they are expected to survive, reports nbc news. Kbtx reports they sustained spinal, neck, and abdominal injuries.",

Reactions to \" look what you made me do \" — and swift in general: swift has made it clear that her upcoming album, reputation, will signal a shift in her previous sweetness-and-light persona, and the new york times notes that the new single does indeed go to \" a darker place. \" the first single appears to place the blame for this shift on swift's enemies. Specifically, \" look what you made me do \" calls out kim kardashian and kanye west, and if you're not up to date on that feud, buzzfeed writer anne helen petersen tweets that today is a good day to read buzzfeed's epic january article on the subject — and on how swift has based her entire career on \" playing the victim. \" bustle has a number of articles side-eyeing swift: this one and this one serve up reminders of all the reasons she's \" problematic, \" including accusations of cultural appropriation and fake feminism, and this one, published after the single dropped, says it's clear she's learned nothing — and certainly isn't apologizing for any of her past behavior. Of course, quite a few taylor fans are in love with the \" savage \" new anthem, and refinery29 rounds up some of the best twitter reactions on that side. But the grapevine rounds up reactions on the other side, particularly from black twitter users. And bustle rounds up a list of things listeners think swift might be copying in the new single, from west himself to beyonce to... Arya stark. Yes, but how is the actual song? billboard's critic notes that it \" slams a ton of different sonic ideas on the table \" in a way that's not perfect, but says this is still a \" gloriously spiteful opening statement \" for her upcoming album. Reviews, however, are most definitely mixed: vulture, for example, complains that \" look what you made me do \" is \" dead on arrival. \" swift will be debuting the song live at the vmas sunday, mtv announced.",

Some highlights from the texas primaries: sen. John cornyn and several house republicans were able to fight off tea party challengers inspired by ted cruz, the state's junior senator. Some observers saw the incumbents ' victories as a sign that the tea party movement is fading, while others noted that the incumbents had shifted a long way to the right to win conservative votes, the new york times finds. There were no surprises in the primaries for governor, reports the ap. Rising star wendy davis cruised to victory in the democratic primary, while front-runner greg abbott, the state's attorney general, was the republican choice to succeed rick perry. The political career of another george bush was launched with george p. Bush's victory in the primary for state land commissioner, reports the washington post, noting that the post is a powerful one in texas and could be a \" good launching board for bush to pursue higher office down the road. \" the 37-year-old attorney, son of jeb and nephew of george w., is expected to easily defeat his democratic opponent.

        "summary": "The us is banning some mexican cilantro thanks to the appalling conditions health officials recently found at multiple cilantro fields two hours southeast of mexico city. Human feces and toilet paper have been found in the growing fields in puebla, and the general lack of sanitation for workers has been linked to an outbreak of the intestinal infection called cyclosporiasis. It sickened at least 304 people in the us last year, most in texas, and another outbreak this year has affected at least 205 people in texas alone, reports nbc news. The cdc notes \" a cluster of illnesses associated with a single restaurant \" in wisconsin has also occurred this year. Cyclosporiasis can cause diarrhea and \" explosive bowel movements, \" and while no one died during last year's outbreak, it sickened people ranging in age from 3 to 88 and resulted in seven hospitalizations, reports the cdc. Per the import alert issued yesterday, the fda \" believes it is extremely unlikely that these outbreaks of cyclosporiasis are due to isolated contamination events because of their recurring nature, both in the timing with which they occur ( typically april-august each year ) and the repeated association of illnesses with cilantro from the state of puebla. \" since 2013, mexican authorities and the fda have visited almost a dozen farms and packing houses that handle cilantro from puebla, and at eight of those found either a total lack of toilets for workers or bathrooms without running water, toilet paper, or soap. The facilities will have to prove that conditions are sanitary before the ban is lifted. Meanwhile, reps from taco bell and chipotle have said they get their cilantro from california, reports bloomberg. ( grossed out? definitely stay away from the beach. )",

The move is part of a far-reaching effort by the trump administration that some are calling \"welfare reform 2.0, \" reports the washington post. Carson's proposal and other new measures are expected to tighten eligibility requirements for assistance and reduce the amount of assistance available for those who do qualify. The move, which requires congressional approval, would affect 4.7 million families relying on federal housing assistance, per the chicago tribune, though about half ( those over 65 and those with disabilities ) would be exempt from rent increases the first six years and exempt from work requirements. Carson says the proposals, which also affect food stamps and medicaid, would be an improvement over existing policies. \" the system we currently use to calculate a family's rental assistance is broken and holds back the very people we're supposed to be helping, \" carson said in a statement, reported by cbs. But the move would increase monthly rent for some of the poorest families from $ 50 per month to $ 150 per month, and tenants ' rights advocates are alarmed. \" when we are in the middle of a housing crisis that's having the most negative impact on the lowest-income people, we shouldn't even be considering proposals to increase their rent burdens, \" diane yentel, president of the national low income housing coalition, told the tribune.

A uk judge has granted charlie's parents two days to turn in evidence that experimental treatments will help their son, reports the guardian. The decision comes days after charlie's hospital announced it would not take him off life support in light of new claims from the medical community of potential treatments and a new york hospital agreed to evaluate him if legal hurdles were cleared. In a packed courtroom occasionally filled with outbursts from charlie's parents, the justice who heard preliminary arguments monday said he would be \"delighted \" if new materials brought forth could change his april decision that denied charlie permission to travel to the us. He also noted that the case needs \"drastic \" evidence in order for him to do so. According to cnn, charlie's parents, connie yates and chris gard, have been given a hard wednesday deadline to provide the sourced evidence, including the date it was produced and how it could affect their son's condition. The family's lawyer claims a us doctor says one experimental treatment gives charlie, conservatively, a 10 % chance of recovery, but no documentation was provided at the preliminary hearing. \"ten percent. You would if it was your son, wouldn't you? \" his mother interjected. The uk's high court will reconvene thursday to review the information. Charlie was born with a rare genetic condition called mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome that has caused severe brain damage. Charlie's story has resonated across the world, with 350,000 people signing a petition demanding he be allowed treatment, and everyone from the pope to president trump weighing in on his fate.",

Nbc characterizes the decision as having been made \" abruptly, \" with discussions starting late wednesday and key calls taking place between 7am and 9am thursday; the letter went out at 9: 43am. Two higher-ups said to have butted heads: secretary of state mike pompeo, who wanted to stay the course and build on progress made with north korea, and national security adviser john bolton, who's long pushed for toppling the kim regime and wanted out of the summit. Bolton appears to have won the debate, and trump is said to have dictated the letter to him. Pompeo, meanwhile, was reportedly blindsided, officials say. \" this has been like herding cats, \" one senior administration official says of trying to get pompeo and bolton's goals aligned. One source disputes this showdown, however, telling nbc all players were a \" pretty tight-knit group. \" at least one source says trump was also irked by vice president mike pence's inflammatory remarks about north korea — pence had made reference to what happened to gadhafi in libya, angering kim jong un — but a senior administration official downplayed any tension. South korea's foreign ministry issued a statement indicating pompeo is still working behind the scenes with south korea's foreign minister, per the new york times.

Nobody in the white house would have been surprised when north korea reacted by calling pence a \"political dummy \" and threatening a \"nuclear-to-nuclear showdown, \" given similar comments by national security adviser john bolton also earned a stinging rebuke last week."

        "summary": "President trump's reversal of former president obama's directive on bathroom use for transgender students caused a clash inside his administration, sources say. Gop insiders tell the new york times that education secretary betsy devos clashed with attorney general jeff sessions over the issue and told trump she opposed the move because of potential harm to transgender students. Trump sided with sessions, and devos eventually signed off on the issue rather than resign or publicly defy trump, the sources say. In a tweet wednesday evening, devos said she considers \" protecting all students, including lgbtq students, not only a key priority for the department, but for every school in america. \" in other developments: jackie evancho, the teenager who sang at trump's inauguration, says she is disappointed by the move and would like trump to meet with her and her transgender sister, the washington post reports. Sean spicer denied wednesday that devos had opposed the policy, saying she was \" 100 % \" on board and there was \" no daylight between anybody \" in the administration, the ap reports. Civil rights groups protested outside the white house wednesday evening, warning that the decision to send the issue back to the states could increase bullying and violence against the estimated 150,000 young americans who identify as transgender, npr reports. Openly gay democratic national committee leadership candidate pete buttigieg attacked the move during a debate wednesday, the hill reports. \" what kind of a bully looks for the most vulnerable person they can find to attack? \" he wondered, saying the decision would make life harder for \" one of the most vulnerable parts of america's population. \" vox takes a look at the background to what it calls \" a fight about the next phase of the lgbtq movement, \" noting that there is no evidence that allowing people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with has led to any rise in sexual assaults. Cnet reports that apple added its voice to those criticizing the decision wednesday. \" we support efforts toward greater acceptance, not less, and we strongly believe that transgender students should be treated as equals. We disagree with any effort to limit or rescind their rights and protection, \" the company said in a statement. Conservative groups praised the move as an end to federal meddling in an issue they believe should be decided locally, the ap reports. \" no longer will federal officials distort federal law that is meant to equalize educational opportunities for women, and no longer will they force local officials to intermingle boys and girls within private areas like locker rooms, showers, hotel rooms on school trips and restrooms, \" said",

        "summary": "\" german-operated a320s do not crash in the cruise. Not these days. This one is weird, \" tweeted the safety editor of flightglobal after the crash of germanwings flight 9525, and with the investigation of the crash that killed 150 still in the very early stages, other experts seem equally puzzled. One black box has been recovered from the pulverized wreckage in the french alps. France's interior minister says this was the cockpit voice recorder, which is damaged but still viable, and investigators will put it back together to \" get to the bottom of this tragedy, \" reports reuters. The search resumed today for the flight data recorder, which may hold information explaining the flight's sudden eight-minute descent just after it reached its 38,000-feet cruising altitude. More: germanwings ceo thomas winkelmann says two americans were on board the flight, per the ap; the state department has yet to confirm, and no other info was given. The length of the descent appears to rule out an explosion or a sudden midair stall, experts say. \" while investigators still need to verify the data are correct, eight minutes is definitely longer compared with the experience we have had in past cases, \" a former french government crash investigator tells the new york times. The debris is scattered over a relatively small area, which the interior minister says is another sign that the plane did not explode in the air, reuters reports. Though earlier reports said otherwise, france's aviation authority has confirmed that the pilots sent no distress call and did not request to start a descent. A senior investigator of the 2000 concorde crash in france tells the guardian that could be a sign that the crash was caused by pilot confusion or a loss of control. The crash could have been caused by technical errors that airbus jets have suffered in the past, according to the ap, which notes that the 2009 crash of air france flight 447 began with false air-speed indications from the jet's instruments, and that the european aviation safety agency issued a warning in november after a lufthansa a321 plunged 4,000 feet in a minute when the autopilot unexpectedly lowered its nose. The ap also suggests pilot error could have been the cause, either from an accidental dive or stall they couldn't recover from or, in the case of decompression, a rush to get down to breathable air at 10,000 feet, which ended in a crash into the mountains. The plane was 24 years old, but the airline says there were no problems with it before takeoff and its age does not seem to have been an issue, reuters reports. \" as long as",

The winner of the competition, who will be announced in october 2018, will receive $ 1 million. The company is also conducting a $ 100,000 \" sweet story challenge \" to learn from contestants the \" tried-and-true methods of naturally sweetening foods or beverages in their cultures, communities, or families. \" $ 1.1 million would be a small price for a soda company as large as coca-cola to pay, considering the role sugar plays in the obesity and type-2 diabetes epidemics, npr reports, and the resulting drop in soda consumption.

It's not a case of mistaken identity, either. The officers included nazim on a list of suspected trouble-makers, including his father, ahead of local elections. Apparently, the officers felt that nazim and his cohorts would try to intimidate voters and planned to round them up ahead of time, reports the times of india. Officers delivered the summons saturday to the incredulous family, but it appears that common sense will prevail. A senior police official in moradabad says nazim is in the clear and the two officers involved were being suspended. \" we have taken the matter very seriously and are ensuring such incidents do not happen in the future, \" he says.

        "summary": "Weeks after the last words from the cockpit of malaysia airlines flight 370 fueled speculation on the missing jet's fate, malaysian authorities have suddenly changed their version of the last words. Instead of \" all right, good night, \" authorities now say the final transmission was actually \" good night malaysian three seven zero \" — a more standard and formal signoff from the pilot or copilot as the plane left malaysian airspace, the guardian notes. More: while the change is unlikely to have any impact on the investigation, the unexplained discrepancy \" speaks to credibility issues, unfortunately, \" says a cnn aviation analyst. Former faa chief of staff michael goldfarb agrees. \" we haven't had a straight, clear word that we can have a lot of fidelity in, \" he says. \" we have the tragedy of the crash, we have the tragedy of an investigation gone awry and then we have questions about where we go from here. \" in australia, meanwhile, the man coordinating the indian ocean search says the hunt is the \" most challenging \" of its kind ever seen and it could be weeks before there are results, the bbc reports. \" it's not something that will necessarily be resolved in the next two weeks, \" says air chief marshal angus houston, who heads a new joint agency center managing the search. The search chief also suggested that the plane may never be found — or at least not for decades, the sydney morning herald reports. He compared the search to the hunt for a warship sunk off the coast of western australia during world war ii and not found until 2008. \" there were eyewitnesses who saw the ship disappear over the horizon but it took us about 60 years to find hmas sydney on the bottom of the ocean, \" he said. With at least 11 planes now in the search zone — where little more than fishing gear and jellyfish has been found — authorities are worried that the busy skies could cause another crash, the ap finds. Houston says a modified boeing 737 will be deployed soon to serve as an air traffic controller for the search area and prevent a mid-air collision.",

The irs and justice department stopped 260,000 bad returns last year, irs deputy commissioner steve miller said. \" there is no doubt in the last couple of years this rate of fraud has gone up, \" miller told reporters. In 2010, there were fewer than 50,000 such returns, involving $ 262 million. A national sweep by the two agencies over the last week targeted 105 people in 23 states and led to 939 criminal charges in 69 indictments related to identity theft. Some of the investigations stretched back years. Arrests were made friday in michigan, ohio, new jersey and new york, where three employees of jpmorgan chase bank were charged by the manhattan u.s. Attorney with taking kickbacks in a $ 4.8 million tax refund scam that used the identities of puerto rican citizens. Law enforcement agencies said other schemes involved stealing the identities of dead taxpayers and mentally disabled people. The irs also went to numerous check-cashing operations across the country to ensure that they were not involved with refund fraud and identify theft.

The official story is that surgeon abbas khan, 32, hanged himself in his cell with his pajama bottoms, reports the new york times. But neither his family nor the british foreign office are buying it. \"my brother was going to be released at the end of the week, \" says afroze khan. \"my brother knew that. He was ready to come back home. He was happy and looking forward to being released. \" british foreign office minister hugh robertson says the uk is demanding an investigation: \" there is no excuse whatsoever for the treatment that he has suffered by the syrian authorities who have in effect murdered a british national who was in their country to help people who were injured during their civil war. \" khan's mother visited him recently and said he was down to about 70 pounds and showed signs of torture. Bashar al-assad had approved his release — it was supposed to happen on friday — and one theory is that someone in his regime who hopes to scuttle peace talks that britain is helping to organize ordered khan's killing, says the bbc.",
