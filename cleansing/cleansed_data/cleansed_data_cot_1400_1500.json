        "summary": "The atlanta journal-constitution has an eyebrow-raising report on a little-known georgia law that allows guns to be placed in the hands of people involuntarily committed for mental health treatment. Federal law prohibits those people from buying guns, and georgia added more than 2,000 such names to the national instant background check system this year. But a peculiar state law requires those names be removed after five years — with no further review or evaluation of the people whose names are being removed. That frees people with a mental illness, who were involuntarily committed only five years prior, to legally purchase a gun anywhere in the us. Georgia removed approximately 500 names from the list this year. It's the only state that automatically removes names from the national database. \"the public has massively overestimated the dangerousness of the mentally disordered, \" dr. Steven hoge, an american psychiatric association chair, tells the journal-constitution. Hoge says georgia's law seems \" reasonable, \" as most people with mental illness recover within \" weeks to months \" of treatment. A state senator who supports the law says it helps remove the stigma from mental illness. \" by now, we know that there will be two responses to [ mass shootings ]: liberals will call for better gun control, and conservatives for better mental health services, \" fusion reports. \" the conflict in georgia — between keeping guns away from people with a history of mental illness, and the dangerous implications of keeping records of those who've been involuntarily committed — illustrates how the second option is so complicated. \"",

James damore, whose memo over the weekend caused an uproar online, said that prior to being fired on monday he had filed a complaint with the national labor relations board alleging he was subjected to \" coercive statements ( threats, promises of benefits, etc. ). \" damore notes it's illegal to fire someone in retaliation for going to the nlrb, though as bloomberg puts it, he'd \" have to prove he was trying to organize collective action among his fellow employees and was fired in retaliation for that. \" a google rep said tuesday that the company could not have retaliated because it didn't learn about the complaint until after he was fired. Wired lays out the reasons why damore may have a case, including california law related to protected activities when it comes to allegations of unequal employee treatment. The ap also notes damore's filing with the nlrb cites a part of the labor relations act that gives employees the right to engage in \" protected concerted \" activities. That includes being active on social media, though it's unclear if his memo, written on a google doc and submitted to an employee-only forum, qualifies for such protection. Damore isn't the only one considering legal action. The guardian reports more than 60 current and former female google employees are weighing whether to file a class-action suit that zeroes in on alleged pay disparities, with some reportedly claiming they're paid about $ 40,000 less than their male counterparts.",

( image: kaap skil museum. ) marine archaeologists working off the coast of holland have recovered a remarkable trove of well-preserved artifacts from a ship that sank nearly 400 years ago. Among the items is a beautiful silken gown that likely belonged to royalty. Back in august 2014, divers from the texel diving club discovered an unassuming bundle at the site of a known wreck buried in the sands at the bottom of the wadden sea. It wasn't until they brought the package to the surface that they realized what they had found: a trove of incredibly well-preserved antique textiles.

And \" by minting a $ 1 trillion coin, then depositing it at the fed, the treasury could acquire enough cash to sidestep the debt ceiling — while doing no economic harm at all. \" sure, it's a \" gimmick, \" but it makes as much sense as the debt ceiling, which lets congress \" tell the president to spend money, then tell him that he can't raise the money he's supposed to spend. \" over at slate, eric posner offers another option: president obama can just raise the debt ceiling himself. After all, as krugman notes, congress is giving obama two different instructions. It's the president's responsibility to choose which one to follow. Then there's the argument that the 14th amendment \" says that the debt of the united states will always be paid, \" an argument that the huffington post notes nancy pelosi likes.

            "Photo by chris kleponis/afp/getty images. With the fiscal cliff behind us, we now must look forward to yet another budgetary battle — over the debt ceiling, in a repeat of summer 2011. Is there a way out of the endless stalemate between president obama and republicans in congress? yes, but it requires the president to assert himself more aggressively than he has so far. The debt standoff is more ominous than the fiscal cliff because it doesn't reflect a legitimate dispute over public policy. While reasonable people can disagree about the right level of taxation and spending, no one believes that the united states should default on its debt, not even the most ardent tea partiers. So holding the debt ceiling hostage is pure brinkmanship — akin to threatening to set off a nuclear bomb in manhattan if the president fails to agree to spending cuts. House republicans would probably argue that the main effect of maintaining the debt ceiling would be to force president obama to cut spending while using tax revenues to pay interest on the debt. But cutting government programs to the degree necessary would also create a crisis — most people and institutions won't want to do business with the government, or work for it, because they won't trust it to do what it promises.

The report from the committee's gop majority, which will be released thursday, slams the administration for violating a statute that says lawmakers must be informed of detainee transfers 30 days in advance, and accuses the white house of including the high-level detainees in the deal as part of its effort to fulfill obama's promise to close guantanamo bay. The detainees were released to qatar, which committee staff visited as part of the investigation. The 98-page report, which reveals new details about the qatar-brokered negotiations, accuses the administration of acting recklessly and claims house members learned more from a taliban statement on the exchange than from the department of defense, the post reports. Dissenting democrats on the committee called the report a \" weighted and politically motivated document, \" cnn reports.

        "summary": "A florida mom whose refusal to permit her son to be circumcised led her to go into hiding for nearly 3 months was arrested for contempt of court yesterday. Heather hironimus has been battling with dennis nebus, the father of her 4-year-old son chase, because nebus wants chase circumcised and she does not. Hironimus initially agreed the procedure could be done but later changed her mind, arguing it was not medically necessary. After a long legal battle, a judge in february ordered hironimus to bring chase to court and turn him over to his father to have the procedure done, but hironimus didn't show up; her attorney said she had \" sought refuge \" feb. 23 at a domestic violence shelter. In march, the same judge issued a warrant for her arrest. Broward county authorities took her into custody yesterday; she's now at the broward county jail, the palm beach post reports. Chase's location is not clear; the boy hasn't seen his father since feb. 19, local 10 reports. In march, hironimus ' lawyer asked the judge to consider giving chase a mental health exam before moving forward, claiming the boy \" is scared to death of the procedure and doesn't want it, \" the sun sentinel reported at the time. The judge refused and ordered hironimus ' arrest; he also specifically took issue with the fact that she had partnered with anti-circumcision \" intactivists \" that \" plastered \" chase's name and picture \" all over the internet. \" while she was in hiding, hironimus filed a federal lawsuit through her lawyer claiming circumcision would violate chase's constitutional rights, the sun sentinel reported last month. ( potential surgeons in the case have backed out. )",

The mistreatment that the former maryland resident says he endured went beyond the methods described in the senate's december report: according to the center for constitutional rights, a nonprofit representing khan, brutal techniques included dumping ice water on his genitals, sexually assaulting him with enemas, hanging him from a wooden beam for three days, and keeping him in a completely dark, bug-infested cell for nearly a year, with only a bucket for a toilet, the ap reports. Khan's accounts were compiled by his lawyers over seven years into a 27-page document and declassified by the us government last month. Khan is to be sentenced in february on charges of conspiracy, murder, and attempted murder for assisting al-qaeda. He has taken a plea deal with the government, with a possible sentence of 19 to 25 years instead of life in prison, but his attorney wants a more lenient sentence based on his torture allegations — especially since khan had agreed to cooperate before what dixon calls \" gratuitous \" torture. \" i lived in anxiety every moment of every single day about the fear and anticipation of the unknown, \" khan says, adding that he suffered panic attacks, nightmares, and hallucinations, reuters notes. The most brutal abuse reportedly only let up once the detainee treatment act passed in 2005. Cia officials have not yet commented on khan's allegations.",

        "summary": "Nbc news spotted an oddity in the latest financial disclosure report from president trump: it shows that first lady melania trump earned at least $ 100,000 in 2017 from certain photos used in mainstream news outlets. The story breaks it down: melania trump has posed for nearly 200 photos by belgian photographer regine mahaux since 2010, often with her husband and son barron. Those photos are available for a fee at getty images, and at least a dozen media outlets have used them over the years — including nbc news, fox news, yahoo news, the san francisco chronicle, the houston chronicle, and the daily mail. The kicker: getty stipulates that the photos can be used only for positive coverage. When nbc reporters contacted reps at the various news organizations, including their own, they generally found that the outlets were unaware of the fine print stipulating positive coverage and had no idea royalties were going to the trumps. Yahoo, for example, took down a photo in question. \" we were not aware of this specific arrangement with getty nor was our editorial influenced by it, \" it says in a statement. \" we have removed the image from yahoo lifestyle. \" the whole thing is odd on two fronts, notes vox: first, that \" news organizations would use photographs that came with any strings attached to its coverage — though it's not clear how closely that rule was followed. \" and second, that someone other than a celebrity would be receiving royalties from photos of them, particularly a first lady.",

        "summary": "Pope francis accepted the resignation of west virginia bishop michael bransfield on thursday and authorized an investigation into allegations he sexually harassed adults, adding awkward drama to an audience with us church leaders over the abuse and cover-up scandal roiling the catholic church, the ap reports. Bishop bransfield — a major fundraiser for the vatican — had been investigated for an alleged groping incident in 2007 and was implicated in court testimony in 2012 in an infamous philadelphia priestly sex abuse case. He strongly denied ever abusing anyone and the diocese said it had disproved the claims. He continued with his ministry until he offered to retire, as required, when he turned 75 last week. Baltimore archbishop william lori will take over bransfield's wheeling-charleston diocese temporarily and investigate accusations against him. The revelation was the latest twist in an incredible turn of events in the us church that began with the june 20 announcement that one of the most prestigious us cardinals, theodore mccarrick, had been accused of groping a teenage altar boy in the 1970s. Francis removed mccarrick as a cardinal in july. The mccarrick affair — coupled with revelations in the pennsylvania grand jury report detailing decades of abuse and cover-up in six dioceses — has fueled outrage among the rank-and-file faithful who had trusted church leaders to reform themselves after the abuse scandal first erupted in boston in 2002. In germany, a new report on sexual abuse inside the church says clergy members in that country abused 3,677 people between 1946 and 2014.",

Marina krim, the doting mom of little lucia krim, 6, and leo krim, 2, made the horrifying discovery just after 5: 30 p.m. In the second floor apartment at 57 w. 75th st., just off central park west, after returning home from a swim lesson with her daughter, nessie krim, 3. Police commissioner raymond kelly told reporters marina krim, who is married to cnbc digital media senior vice president kevin krim, found her apartment dark and seemingly empty and went to ask the doorman if her two other children and the nanny, identified as yoselyn ortega, 50, had left, kelly said.",

You see moms and their strollers a lot. Many people hire nannies here. This is everyone's worst nightmare. \" sources said blood was found in the kitchen, suggesting that's where the attack may have started or where ortega might have first tried to take her own life.

Researchers investigated skin remnants from ancient leatherback turtles and ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs, which resembled fish. The researchers found that all three creatures were covered in black skin or scales, with reason: the coloration may have helped camouflage them and protect them from uv rays, and may also have acted as a method of temperature control, grabbing the sun's heat much like black asphalt does in the sunshine, lead author johan lindgren explains to livescience. The scientists probed the fossil samples using \" complex techniques \" including energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis; they found the appearance of \" oval bodies \" that were verified as melanosomes.

            "Facebook just had the biggest wipeout in stock market history. Shares plunged 19 % on thursday after executives warned that revenue growth would slow as the company focuses on user privacy. The sell-off vaporized about $ 119 billion in market value — the biggest single-day loss for any public company in history, according to thomson reuters. For founder mark zuckerberg, the loss came to almost $ 16 billion, according to forbes, which tracks billionaire wealth in real time. That dropped him from fourth to sixth on the list of richest people in the world. Facebook ( fb ) chief financial officer david wehner said on a conference call with investors that facebook is \" putting privacy first \" after the cambridge analytica scandal triggered a wave of horrible press, customer angst and regulatory scrutiny around the world.

Saying its effects linger far from japanese shores is an understatement, per some recent reports: in alaska: \" you're basically standing in landfill out here, \" says the head of a nonprofit that focuses on ridding the coast of marine debris. Npr reports on a scene replete with refrigerators, ketchup bottles, and the more concerning styrofoam bits, which birds, rodents, and bears have been eating. The exec says the garbage, which was observed in every beach photographed in a 2,500-mile aerial survey completed last year, isn't getting the attention it needs. Indeed, alaska public radio reports that there wasn't any funding for debris cleanup included in the governor's budget, and such funding was removed from the sandy aid bill that passed last week. In hawaii: a refrigerator has also made its way to these shores, reports livescience. \" these items have never before been seen on these beaches, \" says a marine debris specialist, who explains that they're washing ashore in what the site terms \" surprisingly homogenous waves \" — first oyster buoys, then refrigerator parts — due to the wind's effect. In british columbia: its coasts have a styrofoam problem, too, says a helicopter pilot who has been observing the shore for three decades. \" of course there's always debris on the beaches, \" he said. \" but i dropped down... And, holy crap, all of a sudden you see all this stuff. \" an expert on the subject expects the debris to wash ashore \" through next summer. I expect the worst isn't over yet. \" the globe and mail reports that the west coast anticipates it will see as much as 1.65 million tons of debris.",

That's just one example meyer cites of yesterday's marketing, most of which was \" tailored to an aloof elite. \" apple products have never been cheap, but they stayed \" within reach of a middle-class american, \" meyer notes. But the 18-karat-gold apple watch edition is clearly out of grasp for most. \" the prices grate, \" meyer writes. \" and they grate not because they're so expensive, but because they're gratuitously expensive. \" as the edition model will \" have the same innards \" as the $ 349 apple watch sport, \" the only difference is that apple is manufacturing a status symbol with the edition. \" at techradar.com, michelle fitzsimmons gets how meyer is feeling. \" as someone who wants access to apple products yet doesn't have the bankroll to do so, i can't help but feel ignored and pretty put off by apple's strategy, \" she writes.

A new lawsuit, however, claims it's not exactly hers. Jamaican artist flourgon ( real name michael may ) is suing cyrus, sony music, and rca records for $ 300 million, alleging a line in the 2013 song — \" we run things, things don't run we \" — rips off a prominent lyric from flourgon's 1988 hit \" we run things, \" per forbes. That line goes, \" we run things, things no run we. \" may — who is also suing songwriter theron thomas, among others — cites an interview in which thomas describes the influence of caribbean culture on his music as evidence that the alleged theft was deliberate. Without the influence of flourgon's song, \" the entire theme of ' we can't stop ' would be hollow in sound and impact, \" states the lawsuit, filed tuesday in new york, per cnn.",

Yesterday, a source close to portuguese investigators revealed to the guardian the supposed identity of that man: euclides monteiro — who died in a tractor accident in 2009. The cape verde man lived and worked near where several young girls were sexually assaulted, and specifically worked at the praia da luz resort where the mccann family stayed as recently as six months before madeleine's 2007 disappearance. A source tells the guardian police \" have not drawn any definitive conclusions as to whether or not euclides is our man \"; but a portuguese police source reportedly told the mirror that while monteiro was once arrested on suspicion of a series of child sex assaults, \" no charges were brought due to lack of evidence. \" indeed, when scotland yard on wednesday requested information on the new suspect, police in portugal said they had already been looking into this \" primary line of investigation \" since last october, and that evidence of a series of crimes was what drove portuguese officials to reopen the mccann case, which they did after scotland yard reopened its own investigation last summer. The guardian notes that there are \" growing tensions between authorities in the two countries over the handling of the case. \" meanwhile, the daily mail says scotland yard is also investigating three burglars who had previously hit the resort where the family stayed; cellphone data shows the men were near the resort when madeleine went missing and were in \" intense \" contact with each other afterward.",

The source also said there had been another so far unpublicised incident in which another british girl on holiday with her parents was sexually abused, although he did not go into when this came to light nor where or when it took place.

With stevens ' ok, boll started a gofundme campaign that passed its $ 7,500 fundraising goal in just about a week, the pittsburgh post-gazette reports. Boll closed the fundraiser when $ 8,500 had been raised, since that covers what stevens needs for the rest of the school year, but he encourages backers to share any scholarships or other financial assistance they knew of for students. Stevens lived in las vegas, north carolina, and new york before arriving in pittsburgh her freshman year of high school; she moved multiple times even once she'd settled there, including when her father moved across the country after her parents split up, and then after the family home burned down. None of this seemed to faze her, boll wrote on the gofundme page.

Every teacher knows that there are some students who stand out along the way and over the years.kevonna is one of those students.i met kevonna two years ago when she was in an ap language class i was teaching. It didn't take me long to realize that kevonna was the kind of person who pushed through anything to make the most of her opportunities. And unfortunately, as life goes, she had to push through more than some others. Half way through that year, her house burnt to the ground. Her family lost everything and was forced to move across the city. She barely blinked. She would get on a bus for an hour each day, traverse the city in time to arrive at perry by 7: 11 for first period. She kept smiling, kept being a good friend to her classmates, and kept getting good grades. In fact, her grades were good enough toand an acceptance to temple university.for her, the hard work was paying off.somewhere in the midst of that 11th grade year, i started telling kevonna that. She asked what i meant, and i told her that she always seems to rise to the top. There has been plenty of reasons for her to give in to the weight and sink, but she continues to rise up. In fact, on our school talent night, kevonna sang \" rise up \" by andra day and it almost made me tear up. She really will keep rising, and she ' ll do it \" 1000 times again \" as the song says.kevonna's financial aid at temple covers all but $ 3500 of her semester's tuition ( $ 7000 per year ). Temple will not let her sign up for her spring classes until she can pay $ 3500 dollars. In fact, they will not even release her first semester's transcripts without that money. She has lived at the financial aid office over the last month trying to exhaust every option, and it seems that there are none. We called everyone we knew who might be able to help, but we are learning that it is late to get that kind of money"

If these young folks are the future of pittsburgh, we are a very lucky city. Seriously, they are great. Every teacher knows that there are some students who stand out along the way and over the years.kevonna is one of those students.i met kevonna two years ago when she was in an ap language class i was teaching. It didn't take me long to realize that kevonna was the kind of person who pushed through anything to make the most of her opportunities. And unfortunately, as life goes, she had to push through more than some others. Half way through that year, her house burnt to the ground. Her family lost everything and was forced to move across the city. She barely blinked. She would get on a bus for an hour each day, traverse the city in time to arrive at perry by 7: 11 for first period. She kept smiling, kept being a good friend to her classmates, and kept getting good grades. In fact, her grades were good enough toand an acceptance to temple university.for her, the hard work was paying off.somewhere in the midst of that 11th grade year, i started telling kevonna that. She asked what i meant, and i told her that she always seems to rise to the top. There has been plenty of reasons for her to give in to the weight and sink, but she continues to rise up. In fact, on our school talent night, kevonna sang \" rise up \" by andra day and it almost made me tear up. She really will keep rising, and she ' ll do it \" 1000 times again \" as the song says.kevonna's financial aid at temple covers all but $ 3500 of her semester's tuition ( $ 7000 per year ). Temple will not let her sign up for her spring classes until she can pay $ 3500 dollars. In fact, they will not even release her first semester's transcripts without that money. She has lived at the financial aid office over the last month trying to exhaust every option, and it seems that there are none. We called everyone we knew who might be able to help, but we are learning that it is late to get that kind of money",

        "summary": "If you want to help indian women stay safe, one overture that won't be embraced is giving them a curfew. That's what one politician has discovered after his remarks following what one woman says was her near-kidnapping. Per the bbc, dj varnika kundu was driving home friday night just after midnight when she was allegedly chased by two men in an suv. She described what she says was a stalking ordeal on facebook, which ended in the arrest of two men, including the son of a prominent bjp politician. \" i ' m … lucky, because i ' m not lying raped and murdered in a ditch somewhere, \" she wrote online. Enter another bjp pol, ramveer bhatti, who told cnn-news 18 that maybe kundu should bear some responsibility. \" the girl should not have gone out at 12 in the night, \" he said of the 29-year-old. \" why was she driving so late in the night? \" this didn't sit well with actress divya spandana, aka ramya, who blasted bhatti's \" regressive \" statements on whatsapp, then posted a twitter pic of herself at night, seemingly in a vehicle, with the hashtag #aintnocinderella. Hundreds of indian women have since joined in, uploading their own photos showing them going out and having a good time \" after-hours. \" one notable poster: sharmistha mukherjee, daughter of india's ex-president pranab mukherjee and a politician in her own right. \" if i ' m out at 12am, it does not mean i ' m to be raped, molested, chased. My dignity is my right 24x7, \" she tweeted. Journalist palak sharma, who put up her own now-viral pic showing her winking and enjoying a nighttime beverage, says she's received both messages of support and ones calling her \" whore \" and \" slut. \" \" but i ' m not afraid, \" she tells the bbc. \" nothing is going to stop us. \"",

Conservative blog the prudence paine papers first revealed the exchanges between weiner and porn star/stripper ginger lee, a self-described \"fangirl \" of weiner's. Weiner sent at least one direct message to lee, and followed her at least briefly. The blog also notes that weiner seems to have had a habit of following young women who have a crush on him. Fox news adds that of weiner's 198 followees, \"a surprising number … are total babes. \" and in the washington post, alexandra petri concurs: \"a surprising number … do seem to be what might be termed nubile out-of-state houris. \" on gawker, adrian chen observes that to avoid these sorts of scandals in the future, weiner should simply treat twitter like real life: \"would you have a picture taken with your arm around a blonde porn star who basically writes fanfic about you on her blog? \" if not, don't tweet with her, either.",

        "summary": "A black counterprotester at august's white supremacist rally in charlottesville, va., who was shown being beaten in a viral video, is now facing his own troubles with the law. The daily progress reports an arrest warrant has been issued for 20-year-old deandre harris for his alleged attack on an unnamed victim who says it happened shortly before harris ' own beating in a parking garage on aug. 12. Per wvir, a charlottesville police department release notes that the victim went to the local magistrate's office to detail the attack allegedly carried out by harris and to request a warrant. After a detective \" verified \" those facts, a warrant against harris for unlawful wounding, a felony, was issued. Harris was not yet in custody as of the pd's statement. S. Lee merritt, one of harris ' attorneys, tells the washington post the warrant is \" clearly retaliatory \" and also \" highly unusual \" in that it was issued by a magistrate, not the cops. \" we find it highly offensive and upsetting, but what's more jarring is that he's been charged with the same crime as the men who attacked him, \" merritt adds. Nbc news notes that merritt started a fundraiser in september for harris, which has brought in close to $ 45,000 to help identify and bring to justice his attackers. Two men have already been arrested in that case: alex michael ramos, 33, of georgia, and ohio's daniel patrick borden, 18, both charged with malicious wounding. Meanwhile, zach roberts, a journalist who took photos of harris ' beating, tweeted that neither charlottesville cops nor the fbi have had any interest in interviewing him on what he saw that day as a witness, per the root.",

But now he faces \" other than honorable \" discharge, and all because he tried to warn his colleagues in afghanistan about a child rapist, cnn reports. During his 2009-2010 deployment in helmand province, brezler got a local police commander named sarwar jan fired because he was allegedly raping children on us bases. Last year, brezler learned that jan had been reappointed. He immediately warned his colleagues at forward operating base delhi in an email, to which he attached a classified document with allegations about jan ( who is also allegedly tied to the taliban ). The email was sent from an unclassified account, fox news reports. Brezler wanted fob delhi to know that jan \" was a threat not only to local children but to marines, \" says his lawyer. But the marines responded to the email indicating that some of the information brezler sent may have been classified, and brezler turned himself in right away.

So says a new study on rats out of tulane university school of medicine, which found that even the low light of a nearby street lamp interferes with the body's natural production of the sleep hormone melatonin. And the rats ( all of which had human breast tumors ) exposed to dim light at night not only exhibited lower levels of melatonin but had larger, faster-growing tumors that were also completely resistant to the breast cancer drug tamoxifen. \" our levels of melatonin are not determined by sleep, as many people think, \" one researcher tells medical news today. \" it is actually the darkness that is important. \" and he tells the bbc that the blue light emitted from digital devices such as tvs and tablets is particularly disruptive for melatonin production. Other studies have suggested that melatonin may help improve cancer treatments. Still, researchers warn that this study needs to be replicated and validated in humans before determining that all the same mechanisms are at play.

The mississippi department of corrections tells npr that edgar ray killen died thursday night at the age of 92. He was suffering from congestive heart failure and hypertension. Killen, a tree-cutter and small-time preacher, was a founding member and main recruiter for the kkk in the philadelphia area of mississippi in 1964 when james chaney, andrew goodman, and michael schwerner were investigating a church fire, the new york times reports. The three civil rights workers in their early 20s were arrested and then released to klan members, who shot them and buried the bodies. The killings were instrumental in the passage of the 1964 civil rights act and were later dramatized in the 1988 film mississippi burning. Killen was one of 18 people put on trial in 1967 for the murders, but the jury was hung after one juror said she couldn't convict a preacher. The case was reopened decades later, and killen was convicted in 2005 of three counts of manslaughter. He was the only one charged despite other suspects being alive. Goodman's brother calls it \" an american tragedy \" that none of the others ever faced justice. \"i pray to god that edgar ray repented and that he had peace with god, \" chaney's daughter tells the clarion ledger. \"my ultimate desire is when i get to heaven and meet my dad for the first time, i pray that my dad and i could embrace edgar ray. \"",

        "summary": "A new york inmate who has never golfed a game in his life is now a free man, with his innocence restored to him thanks to the game. Golf digest has the incredible conclusion to the story of valentino dixon, a 48-year-old who caught the magazine's attention six years ago, when it profiled the detailed colored-pencil drawings he did of golf courses, a passion that began when a warden asked him to illustrate augusta national's 12th hole using a photograph. He spent as many as 10 hours a day drawing, and the magazine dove into his art as well as his story. It seemed off. He was serving a 39-years-to-life sentence for the august 1991 murder of 17-year-old torriano jackson at a buffalo street party, reports the ap. What golf digest found when it started digging didn't exactly inspire confidence in the conviction: though the gun was dixon's, there was no physical evidence, unreliable witnesses, and another man's confession to the crime just two days after it occurred, among other things. Its 2012 article spurred national media coverage and interest from the georgetown university prison reform project, but as of 2017, things seemed at a dead end. The article explains the \" confluence of factors \" that went on to fuel dixon's vacated conviction, which included the magazine's work and attention on the case from the erie county district attorney's wrongful convictions unit. After 27 years behind bars, dixon was released on wednesday. Read the full story for more on the man who has now admitted to the shooting and what dixon plans to do now.",

The country's leader mentioned how, according to the letter, any deal made now would \" be null and void after this government leaves office \" and that states typically stick with previously made promises no matter who's in charge. Khamenei then accused those handling the nuclear deal negotiations of putting pressure on iran, stating that in the 11th hour, \" the tone of the other party, particularly the americans, becomes harsher, harder, and more violent.

        "summary": "An ancient etching inside a cave in gibraltar may mean that neanderthals ' knuckles weren't dragging quite as much as we believed, reports the bbc. The design suggests neanderthals were capable of symbolic thinking, a trait once believed to be unique to modern humans, anthropologist clive finlayson of the gibraltar museum argues in a new study. The 39,000-year-old design was carved in a visible spot so it could have marked cave ownership by a certain group, been part of a map, or even been ritualistic in nature. The design — eight long lines crossing with three shorter ones, as per reuters — was carved with 317 purposeful strokes into hard dolomite with a stone point. \" is it art? is it a doodle? i don't know, but it is clearly an abstract design, \" finlayson tells national geographic. This new find doesn't stand alone in the quest to prove neanderthal smarts. Recent studies show neanderthals may have tanned hides, buried their dead, decorated their bodies with feathers and pigment, worn jewelry, played a bone \" flute, \" and decorated a spanish cave. But some scientists say the indirect dating — done with 294 stone tools found in sediment above the carving — doesn't definitively link it to neanderthals, the ap reports. And despite no evidence of humans in the area at this time, the period is one of human emigration to europe, so it's possible they were behind the carving. Finlayson isn't deterred: \" no modern human site in europe has this type of technology. So we are confident that the tools were made by neanderthals. \"",

Allison dunkenberger, co-owner of firefly hill vineyards in elliston, tells the roanoke times that someone she thinks \" knew something about the winery's operations \" came onto the property overnight monday, then cut and removed up to 2.5 tons of grapes from 2,500 vines. The theft came the night before a staff of eight was to harvest the same grapes, husband david dunkenberger tells the washington post. \" quick, efficient, multiple, pathetic pieces of excrement, \" a post on the vineyard's facebook page called the pilferers. All that's now left of firefly hill's inventory: not even 200 pounds of grapes. \" we still can't wrap our heads around this, \" allison dunkenberger says. David dunkenberger put it more forcefully in his rebuke of \" the pieces of cowardly, human scum \" behind the theft. \" may you die a slow and agonizingly painful death so that when you are writhing in pain someone will be kind enough to offer you a drink of wine so you know for what you suffer, \" he wrote. Between the grapes themselves, as well as the labor, supplies, and lost sales potential, the dunkenbergers estimate they're out about $ 50,000, and allison dunkenberger says their insurance doesn't include coverage for crop theft. David dunkenberger says he suspects whoever took the grapes will try to sell them far away from elliston. \" i can handle losing a crop to mother nature, but to... Steal what we've worked for for eight months, that's disheartening, \" he says. Police are investigating. ( in canada, someone stole 20,000 cases of beer. )",

        "summary": "The bad news: the ancient tomb at vergina believed to house alexander the great's father may in fact be the final resting place of someone else. The good news: king philip ii's tomb is just a few doors down, according to a new study — though not everyone is in agreement. Researchers built a convincing case last year that alexander's pop rested in what is known as tomb ii, but a different set of experts now say a partial skeleton in the adjacent tomb i could be his, reports discovery. For one thing, the individual was 45 when he died, as was philip. For another, records note that a leg injury three years before his death left philip with a limp. Researchers say a left femur in tomb i, joined awkwardly to the shin, includes a hole likely made by a projectile, reports phys.org. The injury would've \" rendered the person lame, with an uneven gait, \" researchers say, noting the find \" conclusively identifies ( philip ) as the occupant of tomb i, \" per the study in pnas. The remains of a woman, 18, and a newborn also found inside are likely philip's wife and their child, killed shortly after philip's assassination in 336bc, researchers say. Meanwhile, the male skeleton found in tomb ii \" bears no lesions to his legs that would indicate lameness, \" they argue, adding the bones entombed there are too late to be philip's and a scythian warrior. Instead, the study says those bones probably belong to alexander the great's half-brother, king arrhidaeus, and his wife, eurydice, who died in 317bc, reports livescience. But theodore antikas, who authored the earlier study on tomb ii, says the latest research is \" unreliable \" since only some of the bones in tomb i were analyzed. It also isn't clear when some of them were removed from the tomb; they were found in storage and hadn't been seen since the tomb's discovery in 1977. The controversy is likely to continue. One thing experts agree on: tomb iii at the complex belongs to alexander the great's son. ( divers recently found treasure dating to alexander's reign. )",

        "summary": "An air tanker fighting a wildfire at yosemite national park mysteriously crashed yesterday, killing the pilot, the los angeles times reports. A spokesman for the state's department of forestry and fire protection says it's believed the pilot was alone in the plane and that he worked for dyncorp international, a contractor that provides planes to california's firefighting forces. Rescue efforts were initially hampered due to the crash site's location: the top of a 2,500-foot cliff. An faa spokesman notes that the plane crashed \" under unknown circumstances, \" cnn reports. The pilot — whose name his family asked to be withheld until other loved ones are notified — was battling the dog rock fire, which has already raged over 130 acres and prompted park officials to evacuate at least 60 homes, notes cnn. The s-2t tanker that crashed was one of 26 that cal fire bought nearly 20 years ago from the department of defense, souping them up \" with modern, powerful turboprop engines \" that made them \" faster, safer, and more maneuverable. \" the air tankers can speed around a fire site at more than 300mph and dump 1,200 gallons of fire retardant at once, the san francisco chronicle reports. Although a wildfire expert tells the times that the s-2ts are \" dependable, \" the newspaper notes that the us forest service has been pushing for a plane specifically designed for firefighting.

By tuesday night, rescuers had climbed to the wreckage, which was perched on a 2,500-foot escarpment near el portal, the park's west entrance. A national park service search and rescue team was the first to set out for the site in the late afternoon, lighting a path with headlamps. Daniel berlant, a spokesman for the state department of forestry and fire protection, said the agency's s2-t tanker crashed while fighting the 130-acre dog rock fire. Debris from the crash was scattered on highway 140, which was closed because of the blaze. Berlant said it was believed the pilot was alone in the plane, which came down in an area where many yosemite employees reside and few tourists visit. The cause of the crash has not been determined. Officials did not identify the pilot or his home base. Berlant said the pilot worked for dyncorp international, which also maintains cal fire's planes.

At about 6: 45 p.m, cal fire reported that rescue teams had reached the crash site in rugged terrain and were working to determine the condition of the pilot. It was not clear whether anyone was on the plane besides the pilot, but the grumman s2 tracker is usually flown with only a pilot aboard, said alyssa √smith, a cal fire spokeswoman.

        "summary": "An emotional cnn town hall last week after the feb. 14 shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school focused on gun control and school safety, but the network soon found itself in a tiff with the family of one of the survivors. Conservative outlets went after cnn for \" scripting \" the event after 17-year-old colton haab, who was supposed to take part in the town hall, didn't show because his family says the network was telling him what question to ask, per huffpost. Even president trump weighed in, once more calling cnn \" fake news. \" but the ap reports that on tuesday, colton's dad, glenn haab, fessed up to modifying an email he sent to other media outlets as supposed proof that cnn was trying to tell colton what to say during the event. Cnn had adamantly denied it scripted colton's, or anyone's, questions for the town hall, but glenn haab then sent to fox news and huffpost an email between himself, his son, and a cnn producer that was meant to show colton was being told what question to ask by cnn. But cnn offered up its own version to the washington post, which shows the email exchange in its entirety and reveals that haab's version of one of the emails deleted certain words that made clear the question colton was cleared to ask was one he'd originally submitted himself. Glenn haab now tells the ap he did leave out some words from his version of the email, but that \" there was nothing malicious behind it. \" \" it is unfortunate that an effort to discredit cnn and the town hall with doctored emails has taken any attention away from the purpose of the event, \" the network said in a statement.",

        "summary": "A recent nasa study has come to a shocking conclusion that contradicts a host of other studies, multitudes of climate scientists, the un, and even other scientists at nasa: antarctica is actually gaining more ice than it's losing, despite global warming. How's that possible? live science reports the gains — approximately 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008 — come from snow accumulating faster in parts of antarctica than ice sheets are collapsing and glaciers thinning out elsewhere. Basically, warmer temperatures mean more moisture in the air, which leads to precipitation. Nasa notes the study, which was published oct. 30 in the journal of glaciology, doesn't disprove global warming, and if warming trends continue the scales will eventually tip toward antarctica losing more ice than it's gaining. The washington post reports the study has — obviously — been controversial within the scientific community and led to climate-change deniers having \" a field day. \" skeptical scientists point out the most recent data in the nasa study comes from 2008, while others question the accuracy of its measurement and tools, according to livescience. The post reports still others wonder what is causing the annual rise in sea levels if not the loss of antarctic ice. The nasa scientists behind the study aren't swayed. \"we have a very high confidence in our results, \" one researcher says. \"we have examined the accuracy of our results quite carefully. We believe they're accurate. \" still the controversy is unlikely to die out anytime soon. \" arguing that because their results are different, they must be better is unsustainable, \" one geoscientist says.",

            "Wes craven's 1984 horror film a nightmare on elm street owes at least part of its success to reasons evident in the title. For his setting, craven didn't use some cobwebbed old house or fog-drenched eastern european village but, like john carpenter's halloween, a bucolic suburban anywhere, the sort of prosperous picket-fence neighborhood previous generations had strived hard to reach.

Paul's school made headlines, chessy prout says she's tired of hiding. \" i want everyone to know that i am not afraid or ashamed anymore, and i never should have been, \" she tells today of the may 2014 assault. Prout was just 15 when she was sexually assaulted at the prestigious new hampshire school while on a date with senior owen labrie, who is out on bail while appealing his conviction of misdemeanor sexual assault. Prout says she was \" disgusted \" that labrie — acquitted of felony sexual assault charges — convinced a jury that he didn't knowingly rape her \" because he definitely did do it knowingly, \" but says she hopes he learns from his crime. \" because if he doesn't learn, he will do it to another young woman. \" prout — who also described having panic attacks and hiding in her closet, per the ap — has teamed up with nonprofit promoting awareness victim empowerment and says she wants to encourage \" other people to feel empowered and just strong enough to be able to say, ' i have the right to my body. I have the right to say no. \" ' in an effort to bring about change, she's also filed a civil case against st. Paul's, which accused her of attacking the school \" from behind a cloak of anonymity \" and filed a request that her identity be released.

The discovery, outlined in the new edition of science, could shake up the current understanding of the region's ecosystem. \" we were astonished, \" says a stanford university scientist in on the discovery off the alaskan coast. \" if you rank all the phytoplankton blooms anywhere in the world by the amount of phytoplankton that is contained in them, the under-ice bloom that we saw... Would finish at the very top of the list. \" the algae seems prevalent wherever first-year polar ice is present, and the national post notes that such ice is becoming more common as thicker multi-year ice retreats.",
