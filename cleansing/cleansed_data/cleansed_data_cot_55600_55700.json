The be-3 rocket and empty crew capsule flew to a suborbital height of about 62 miles, at which point the capsule and rocket separated, engadget reports. The capsule landed on earth with the help of parachutes, the rocket's engines roared back to life about 5,000 feet above the landing pad, and the rocket touched down at 4.4mph. \" rockets have always been expendable, \" bezos wrote in a monday blog post. \" not anymore. Now safely tucked away at our launch site in west texas is the rarest of beasts, a used rocket. \" bezos also tweeted a video of the event tuesday morning, noting \" controlled landing not easy, but done right, can look easy. \" bezos notes how reusable rockets could economize space travel, telling cnnmoney that current space travel is akin to airlines throwing out every 747 jet after it makes a cross-country journey. \" you can imagine how expensive your ticket would be, \" he notes. Elon musk tweeted kudos tuesday, posting, \" congrats to jeff bezos and the bo team for achieving vtol on their booster, \" though he turned that compliment into a backhanded one with a tweet that read, \" it is, however, important to clear up the difference between'space ' and ' orbit. ' \" his point: that even though spacex's rockets have yet to nail an upright landing after leaving earth's atmosphere, at least his rockets leave the atmosphere — a task requiring 10 times more speed and 100 times the energy of suborbital rockets, per cnn. But bezos says he doesn't even consider musk's company, or richard branson's virgin galactic, to be competitors. \" i think of our competition primarily as earth's gravity, \" he says. \" space is a big place.

A film icon, choi died monday at a south korean hospital, where she was receiving dialysis, her son tells yonhap news. She was 91. Beginning her film career in 1947's a new oath, choi became one of south korea's leading actresses in the 1950s and ' 60s and one of the country's first female directors, reports screen daily. By 1976, she'd appeared in more than 130 films, and apparently caught the eye of future north korean leader kim jong il. That year, while in hong kong, choi was kidnapped by agents working for kim, who believed she could help elevate north korea's film industry, reports the bbc. Months later, choi's ex-husband, director shin sang-ok, was also kidnapped when he went to hong kong to look for her. Reunited at a party, the pair eventually made 17 films in north korea, including 1985's salt, for which choi took home the best actress award at the moscow film festival, per screen daily. But though she was the first korean to receive such an honor, choi wasn't happy living under guard. While promoting a movie in vienna in march 1986, choi and shin sought asylum at the us embassy. The pair — who would spend more than a decade in the us before returning to south korea in 1999 — would later reveal secret recordings in which kim apologized for the kidnapping scheme, per cnn. But to this day, north korea claims the pair sought refuge in the country, per the bbc.",

The bbc reports that for the first time ever, researchers were able to watch the rise of a new species play out in nature. \" it's an extreme case of something we're coming to realize, \" a speciation expert says. \" evolution in general can happen very quickly. \" according to a press release, in 1981 an interloper arrived on daphne major, a tiny island in the galapagos archipelago where peter and b. Rosemary grant were studying darwin's finches. The new bird, bigger than the three species living on the island, was a large cactus finch that had apparently flown from an island more than 60 miles away. Unable to return, it mated with a local medium ground finch. The resulting offspring, nicknamed the big bird lineage for their size, were unable to attract partners from the local finch population due to their weird song and unusual beak size and mated only among themselves. B. Rosemary grant calls it a \" terrifically inbred lineage, \" science alert reports. Within just two generations, the big birds were a distinct species, as confirmed by genomic sequencing and their own unique physical characteristics. An expert says if a naturalist came to the island today, they would simply believe there were four native finch species with nothing giving away the big bird as a recent addition. It was touch-and-go there for a minute — droughts in 2002 and 2003 killed all but two big birds — but there are now 30 or so members of the hybrid species living on daphne major.

        "summary": "Madonna's 15-year-old son has been ordered by a judge to return to his famous mom in new york, though it's not clear whether rocco ritchie — who, his lawyers have said, would much rather stay with dad guy ritchie — has actually complied with said order. Sources have been saying rocco had no plans to return to his mom; he's not pictured in any of the christmas day snaps of her kids that madonna shared on instagram ( though she did also share an older picture of rocco with the caption, \" merry x-mas to the sun-shine of my life! \" ); and page six reports that he spent the holiday with his dad and told a friend, via instagram, that he was staying in london. So what's the problem? as tmz reports, it sounds like pretty typical teenage stuff. Sources say rocco is \" miserable \" having to be on tour with his mom, and that many \" horrible, full-blown fights with screaming and crying \" have taken place. Radar also reports the teen was fed up with how \" controlling \" his mom is. Rocco has also reportedly said that his mom treats him like a trophy, not a son. And page six notes that madonna's oversharing may be part of the problem: among other things, she's posted things like a picture of rocco in pigtails and a snap of him in a bathing suit with the hashtag, \" #nosausage. \" of course, there are also the sources telling tmz that, per madonna, this is all guy ritchie's fault and that he's trying to come between mother and son by trash-talking madonna to rocco.

        "summary": "The nation that seems to be showing up in most headlines thursday is nambia, mainly because it doesn't actually exist. In a speech to african leaders wednesday, president trump referred to \" nambia \" not once but twice, first in his general introduction and then later when he mentioned that \" nambia's health system is increasingly self-sufficient. \" as the bbc notes, that led to plenty of online jokes, along with people wondering whether he meant gambia, zambia, or namibia. Turns out, it was the last of those. Coverage: for the record: the official white house transcript of the speech made the correction without mention of the mispronunciation. ( you can hear for yourself in this video. ) but that hasn't slowed a barrage of coverage making light of the president's mistake. One example: at cnn, anderson cooper referred to nambia as a \" magical land far, far away \" in his recap. Namibia 101: the gaffe has led to a slew of civics-type primers about namibia. Time, for instance, notes the tiny nation of fewer than 2.5 million people is relatively young, having achieved its independence in 1990. Among the factoids it highlights: namibia is a big producer of diamonds and it has environmental protection written into its constitution. Silver lining: \" if trump's blunder was worth anything, it was this: the world now knows about namibia, \" writes luis gomez at the san diego union-tribune. He notes that namibia also is one of the top global producers of uranium. The main point: the gist of trump's speech was to tout the region's economic potential ( he said he has friends who go there \" trying to get rich \" ), and a member of the african advocacy group one praised the intent. \" i know ' nambia ' will be the narrative that comes from those remarks, but potus is right on this: africa has tremendous business potential, \" tweeted rep ian koski. Namibia's reaction: officially, nada. No major government official, including president hage geingob, who was present, has said anything publicly about the mistake. But the washington post reports that namibians themselves sound a little miffed and are mocking trump, like so.",

        "summary": "Take your pick as to which of these statements from alibaba founder jack ma is gloomier: he's going back on his pledge to create 1 million us jobs, and the us-china trade war that he blames for that plan's undoing is one that he believes could last two decades. \" it's going to last long, it's going to be a mess, \" the chinese tech billionaire said tuesday. He addressed the jobs plan, made after he met with then president-elect donald trump in january 2017, on wednesday: \" this promise was on the basis of friendly china-us cooperation and reasonable bilateral trade relations, but the current situation has already destroyed that basis. This promise can't be completed. \" cnn provides background, explaining ma's \" vague promise \" didn't involve building alibaba facilities in the us, but rather by helping fire up small us businesses by enabling them to better tap into the chinese market. The wall street journal also uses the word \" vague \" to describe how critics viewed ma's pledge, observing that, nearly two years later, alibaba hasn't released any figures related to the number of jobs created thus far. Count the washington post among those critics. It points out that based on commerce department figures, 1 million new american jobs would require that us exports to china rise by an additional $ 206 billion a year. That's a more than 100 % jump over 2017's $ 188 billion in exports, a figure that encompasses things that wouldn't benefit from alibaba's platform, like airplanes.",

        "summary": "Campbell's is tinkering with its chicken soup recipe to appeal to millennials, multicultural families, and same-sex parents — among others, the new york times reports. The company is removing ingredients that have fallen out of favor with customers — potassium chloride, monosodium glutamate, disodium inosinate, and, um, celery, to name just a few — in an effort to shore up flagging sales. \"we're closing the gap between the kitchen and our plants, \" campbell soup ceo denise morrison tells the times. While most of the changes were made with an eye on more natural ingredients, celery apparently fell victim to child taste-testers. All told, the new recipe includes only 20 ingredients to the old recipe's 30. But don't worry if you're a fan of classic campbell's chicken soup in all its disodium guanylate goodness. Npr reports the changes will only affect children's chicken soup containing noodles shaped like star wars and frozen characters. After a minor change to the recipe in 2011, this more complete overhaul took campbell's chefs two months of tinkering, according to the times. Npr reports the company may or may not make similar changes with its classic chicken soup recipe. But company chefs are already attempting to remove high-fructose corn syrup from campbell's tomato soup, according to the times. \"it's a delicate balance because these products are beloved, \" one campbell soup executive says. ( if fewer ingredients can't save campbell's, maybe instant soup pods can. )",

Meade, a christian numerologist and self-described \" researcher, \" says sept. 23 is foretold in the bible's book of revelation as the day a series of catastrophic events will begin, and as a result, \" a major part of the world will not be the same, \" the washington post reports. The bible prophecies a woman \" clothed with the sun \" and a \" crown of 12 stars \" giving birth to a boy who will \" rule all the nations \" while she fights off a seven-headed dragon. The woman, meade says, is the constellation virgo, which on saturday will be positioned under nine stars and three planets, per popular mechanics. The baby boy will be the planet jupiter, which will be moving out of virgo on that night. According to meade, who says he studied astronomy at an unspecified university in kentucky, the great change in our world will be the result of the arrival of nibiru, a planet famous in conspiracy circles but which astronomers say doesn't exist. David morrison, a senior space scientist at nasa, says that if nibiru were really on a collision course with earth, we would have seen it by now. \" it would be bright, \" he says, per the post. \" it would be easily visible to the naked eye. \" but that's not dissuading meade, who points to the fact that sept. 23 falls 33 days after last month's total solar eclipse as proof of his prophecy. \" jesus lived for 33 years. The name elohim, which is the name of god to the jews, was mentioned 33 times [ in the bible ], \" meade says. \" it's a very biblically significant, numerologically significant number. \"",

Once, robert de niro was a truly great actor. But this movie \"represents a new low … a level of embarrassment to which i never thought i would see him sink. \"",

According to a study in cell research, the ottawa researchers discovered that protein cardiotrophin 1 ( ct1 ) can fuel healthy heart growth, repair heart damage, and cause the heart to pump more blood in cases of left heart failure, as a result of heart attack, and right heart failure, as a result of high blood pressure in the lungs, reports medical news today. It's a big deal since medications used to treat left heart failure don't work on right heart failure, which usually requires a heart transplant, per a release. Exercise can be beneficial because it boosts the heart's ability to pump blood, but \" people with heart failure usually can't exercise, \" researcher lynn megeney tells the ottawa citizen. The heart usually responds by expanding, irreversibly, in an unhealthy way. But that's why ct1 is \" very exciting, \" megeney says. It \" causes heart muscles to grow in a more healthy way and it also stimulates blood vessel growth in the heart, \" increasing blood flow just like with exercise. And just like with exercise, the heart returns to its original size afterward. Megeney says the discovery could lead to fewer heart transplants, but he says it could be two or three years before researchers begin clinical trials on humans and, assuming they go well, a decade before treatment is available to the public.

            "Researchers have discovered that a protein called cardiotrophin 1 ( ct1 ) can trick the heart into growing in a healthy way and pumping more blood, just as it does in response to exercise and pregnancy. They show that this good kind of heart growth is very different from the harmful enlargement of the heart that occurs during heart failure. They also show that ct1 can repair heart damage and improve blood flow in animal models of heart failure. The results are published in cell research. The research team is from the ottawa hospital, the university of ottawa, the university of ottawa heart institute and carleton university. Heart failure is a leading cause of death and disability in high-income countries and a growing problem around the world. It occurs when the heart can't pump enough blood through the body, often because a heart attack has damaged the heart muscle tissue. \" when part"

State department has demanded that davis be freed. Under international agreements, people carrying diplomatic passports are granted diplomatic immunity, the department said. Davis ' lawyer filed a petition friday, challenging the court's jurisdiction over the case. A judge will hear arguments on february 25. The united states says davis was assigned to the u.s.

Here's how it works: the young females'reproductive organs are functional, but internal, and protected by an exoskeleton.

These females have functioning reproductive organs, but their genitals are still internal and protected by a tough shell.

Normally, mature female widow spiders engage in sexual cannibalism — an evolutionary strategy that improves a species'reproductive fitness as a whole. But in this case, the male widow spiders, who are normally monogamous, have adopted a strategy that's allowing them to have sexual liaisons with multiple partners. It's a completely selfish act but also one that improves an individual male's reproductive success.

Obama called on the egyptian government \" to move swiftly to explain the changes that have been made. \" mr. Mubarak's speech left the white house with a sense of \" disbelief, \" a u.s. Official said. Egyptian officials said mr. Mubarak gave the u.s. Much of what vice president joe biden requested earlier in the week: the delegation of presidential powers to the vice president, omar suleiman. But mr. Suleiman, who delivered a televised address after mr. Mubarak, enraged",

            "The unemployment insurance system is in crisis due to a combination skyrocketing unemployment and – in some cases – poor planning. A record 20 million americans collected unemployment benefits last year, and thirty states have run out of funds and been forced to borrow from the federal government, raise taxes, or cut benefits. In many other states the situation is deteriorating fast. Using near real-time data on state revenues and the benefits they pay out, we estimate how long state trust funds will hold up.

        "summary": "Washington, dc, could be about to leave the rest of the us behind and move a lot closer to europe, at least as far as family leave is concerned. The dc council backs legislation, to be introduced tuesday, that would give workers 16 weeks of paid leave for events like the birth or adoption of a child, the terminal illness of a parent, or recovery from a military deployment, reports the washington post. The paper notes that the plan applies to almost all workers in the city ( including part-time ) and is more than double anything on offer in any of the 50 states. It will cover 100 % of pay for people making $ 52,000 a year or less; the maximum weekly pay for the highest earners would be $ 3,000 per week. The new family and medical leave fund would be funded by a levy on employers that the post likens to a state unemployment insurance fund, with employers paying in on a sliding scale that goes up to 1 % of salaries for the highest-paid workers. Wamu reports the universal paid leave act of 2015 has the votes to pass the council; the legislation would then go to the mayor. The dc plan is a big victory for president obama's push to boost family leave. Instead of trying to get legislation through congress, the administration is offering grants to help create state-level paid family leave plans. The administration \" has realized the action is on the state and local level, and they gave us the money to model how this could actually work, \" dc council member elissa silverman tells the post. \" we now have a national platform and a great opportunity with this legislation to show how it can be done. \" the us is one of the only countries in the world without paid maternal leave, and experts say that has caused a lower rate of female participation in the labor force, reports the international business times.

Grist expands on a usda study showing that the number of farms run by women has nearly tripled in the last three decades. Add in secondary operators, and women now account for 30 % of american farmers. The trend is accelerating of late, and grist sees two general groups — women 40 and older who are ditching office jobs and 20-somethings coming out of school with agriculture or environmental science degrees. A few general characteristics: women's farms are typically on the small side, with only 5 % registering sales of $ 100,000 or more, says a blog post from usda deputy chief kathleen merrigan. Along those lines, more female farmers rely on \" off-the-farm \" income than their male counterparts. 85 % of women own the land they farm, versus 66 % of male farmers. Younger women are entering farming at a faster clip than older women are leaving. And finally, \" so hot is ag life that novels about farming are replacing chick lit, offering an unexpected twist to the notion of dirty romance, \" writes grist's lori rotenberk, referring to this story in the atlantic.",

In march, the patriot-news reported that matt had a rocky relationship with his adopted father. His biological mother told the patriot-news she believed sandusky had stolen her son from her. His biological mom, debra long, testified before the grand jury in early 2011 about strange behavior she says she witnessed between her son and sandusky. Matt testified, too. But sandusky's attorney, joe amendola said at the time that he was not worried about matt's testimony, and that long was making false allegations because she was angry at the sandusky family."

        "summary": "Should sending your kid to play alone at a local park land you in jail? because that's what happened to debra harrell. The 46-year-old south carolina mom repeatedly sent her 9-year-old daughter to a well-trafficked park while she went to work at mcdonald's. When the parents of other children at the park found out, they called police, who arrested harrell and charged her with unlawful conduct toward a child. The daughter has been placed in state custody. Local news outlets first reported the story on july 1, but it's been getting wider attention lately thanks to an indignant post on reason from \" free range kids \" advocate lenore skenazy. And so far, pretty much everyone agrees that the arrest is senseless and wrong. Some reactions: skenazy notes that the original news reports make it sound like harrell \" committed a serious, unconscionable crime, \" as locals speculate that the girl could have been kidnapped. \" to which i must ask: in broad daylight? in a crowded park? just because something happened on law &amp; order doesn't mean it's happening all the time in real life. \" \" since i ' m a parent, harrell's arrest scares me: how can i appropriately parent my child when doing something that seems relatively safe, if out of fashion, can get you arrested? \" asks jessica grose at slate. One law professor tells grose that the statutes for child welfare laws are often broadly written, giving police lots of latitude — and allowing \" race, class, and gender biases to influence decisions. \" that could be the case here, because harrell is black, and her poverty helped cause the situation. \" the story is a convergence of helicopter parenting with america's primitive family policy, \" writes jonathan chait at new york. \" our welfare policy is designed to make everybody, even single mothers, work full-time jobs. The social safety net makes it difficult for low-wage single mothers to obtain adequate child care. And society is seized by bizarre fears that children are routinely snatched up by strangers in public places, \" which is actually an exceedingly rare phenomenon. \" the state has caused the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer in the park, \" writes conor friedersdorf at the atlantic, and they're taking the child at a time when the state has a shortage of foster families. And there's no empirical evidence saying the child would be safer, say, sitting at mcdonald's. \" the actual safety of a given kid is not being rigorously determined. State employees are drawing on",

A new six-year study of the mammalian family tree, looking at dna and anatomical evidence in greater detail than ever before, has identified protungulatum donnae as the most likely common ancestor for all 5,400 placental mammal species, reports the new york times. The critter, however, is only hypothetical, notes the la times, explaining that scientists used data to \" reverse-engineer \" it. The study examined 83 mammals and fossils for more than 4,500 traits, creating a database 10 times larger than any previous database. Because protungulatum donnae would have emerged 200,000 to 400,000 years after the great extinction that ended the dinosaurs — about 36 million years later than previous estimates — scientists say this is a clear sign the rise of the mammals was tied to that mass extinction.

        "summary": "Promising new research may make it possible to detect autism in babies before symptoms appear. Researchers scanned the brains of infants with autistic siblings considered at high risk of developing the disorder themselves. They report in the journal nature that brain changes identified in mris of infants allowed them to predict with 80 % accuracy in the first year which ones would go to show autistic symptoms. Children usually do not show signs of autistic spectrum disorder ( asd ), such as not making eye contact, until age 2 or older. Early intervention has been shown to ease and even reverse symptoms. Lead author joseph piven tells cbs news \" the first year of life ( is ) where the brain is most malleable \" and responsive to treatment. Though small in scope, the first-ever study could lead to development of a tool to predict autism in high-risk infants — and perhaps in the general population — before their first birthday \" to prevent these children from falling behind in social and communication skills, \" co-author annette estes tells the guardian. One in 100 children develop autism, but that risk zooms to one in five for those with an autistic sibling, per nature. Scientists analyzed the brain scans of 106 babies at high risk and 42 at low risk for the disorder. Those in the high-risk group who later went on to develop asd saw unusual growth of the outer surface of the brains in the first year of life, followed by \" an overgrowth of the brain \" in the second year, piven tells cbs. That brain growth was linked to asd symptoms. ( \" neural fingerprint \" of mom's voice may help unlock secrets of autistic brains. )",

In fairness, that guy was the wealthiest man in the state. Hedge-fund manager david tepper has an estimated worth of $ 10.6 billion, and after decades in new jersey he's officially moved his residence and business operations to the sunshine state. According to cnbc, people close to tepper say he wanted to be closer to his mother and sister in florida. But it also points out he stands to save hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes by moving south. Thanks to new jersey's 8.97 % tax burden on its highest earners, tepper likely paid nine figures in taxes — potentially more than $ 500 million — over the past three years. Unlike tepper's old home, which had the third highest tax burden in the country, florida has one of the lowest, the christian science monitor reports. It has no personal-income or estate taxes. But tepper's gain is new jersey's loss. \"we may be facing an unusual degree of income-tax forecast risk, \" new jersey's budget and finance officer says regarding tepper's move. The state gets about 40 % of its revenue from personal-income taxes — a large chunk of which comes from the incredibly wealthy. Being off by even 1 % in income-tax forecasts could mean a budget shortfall of $ 140 million. But all is not lost for the garden state. Its population of tax-paying millionaires is continuing to rise, and it boasted the fourth highest number of millionaires in the country in 2015.

How emotional that must have been sitting in the courtroom. \" correspondent poppy harlow responded, \" it was...

How to flip it around in mid-air? apple considers using: \" lift foils \" that emerge from the surface of the phone thrusting gas to turn the phone around a weighted mass inside the phone the patent also looks at ways to stop iphones from being dragged off tabletops by their cables — perhaps by ejecting the cables when pulled rapidly along a surface.

The \"protective mechanism for an electronic device \" patent application says it aims to prevent some or all of the damage to any electronic device with a processor – such as a tablet or a laptop – but specifically mentions the iphone. The system needs a sensor to detect when the device is falling and how it is positioned relative to the ground, according to the website appleinsider.com. Position and speed of falling could be measured using simple gyroscopes, accelerometers or position sensors, although the patent also mentions more sophisticated equipment such as gps and imaging sensors. Data on how and when impact is going to occur is fed into a processor that must make a decision on how best to hit the ground to avoid damage. The system must then - and this is the really difficult part - reorientate the device in mid-air so it lands as flat as possible.

It's regarding the trans-pacific partnership, a proposed pact with 11 pacific rim nations that the hill notes would be the biggest trade deal since nafta. In this case, the usual dc politics are flipped: most democrats oppose the president and most republicans support him, reports the wall street journal. Despite today's progress — it was introduced as \" fast-track \" legislation in the house and senate — its ultimate fate is unclear in congress. The new york times predicts that for obama, it will be \" one of the toughest legislative battles of his last 19 months in office. \" making it fast-track legislation means that lawmakers would vote yes or no on the deal once the us and the other nations agree on terms, but they would not be able to add amendments. That greatly increases obama's chances of getting other nations — including japan, vietnam, canada, and mexico — to sign on, because they wouldn't have to fear later changes. A sign of the challenges supporters face: the afl-cio says it will spend six figures on ads going after 16 senators and 36 members of the house, reports the washington post.

Even today, the chinese are setting the pace in the global fireworks industry. \" more and more of the product these days is made in china, so if there was a lot of research and development, it'd be going on in china, \" conkling said. But there's still something to be said for american know-how: every year, specialty fireworks manufacturers in the united states come up with fresh twists — with a big assist from the u.s. Army. \""

Who did the nobel prize committee actually call to inform the european union it won this year's peace prize? the european commission, european council president herman van rompuy or president of the european parliament martin schultz? europe still does not have a single telephone number. Many politicians outside of europe do not understand that, but the variety is one of the eu's strengths that were honored by the award. The supranational group of states, in which sovereign national governments communalize some of their powers, is a unique body. The european parliament is also unique in that representatives from all 27 member states have a nearly equal ability to influence legislation. Citizens of the eu can move among and live in any of the other member states, and the internal market provides companies with access to a massive market and the opportunities it can offer. And still, national governments take the lead in the council of the european union, where a constant conflict exists between national and european interests. The european union is a peace project.

In the long run, the decision certainly makes sense, as europe is currently enjoying one of its longest eras of peace and stability since the union was first born in 1952. After the two nations fought three wars in the span of 70 years, now \" war between germany and france is unthinkable. \" however, as many people are pointing out, awarding the prize to the eu in 2012 seems odd, when the union itself is being threatened by economic turmoil and the currency union shared by most of its members appears to be a massive mistake. Given the current money problems, the prize of $ 1.2 million almost seems like mockery, though some are interpreting the decision as a giant pep talk for a continent that sorely needs a reminder of what it can accomplish.

Who did the nobel prize committee actually call to inform the european union it won this year's peace prize? the european commission, european council president herman van rompuy or president of the european parliament martin schultz? europe still does not have a single telephone number. Many politicians outside of europe do not understand that, but the variety is one of the eu's strengths that were honored by the award. The supranational group of states, in which sovereign national governments communalize some of their powers, is a unique body. The european parliament is also unique in that representatives from all 27 member states have a nearly equal ability to influence legislation. Citizens of the eu can move among and live in any of the other member states, and the internal market provides companies with access to a massive market and the opportunities it can offer. And still, national governments take the lead in the council of the european union, where a constant conflict exists between national and european interests. The european union is a peace project. People who talk and trade with each other do",
            "In what may be the most bizarre decision in the history of the award, the nobel peace prize has been awarded to the european union. All 27 nations and 500 million citizens. The nobel committee cited the eu's contributions to \" peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights \" that have essentially kept the continent from tearing itself apart, the way it has so many times up to and including world war ii. In the long run, the decision certainly makes sense, as europe is currently enjoying one of its longest eras of peace and stability since the union was first born in 1952. After the two nations fought three wars in the span of 70 years, now \" war between germany and france is unthinkable. \" however, as many people are pointing out, awarding the prize to the eu in 2012 seems odd, when the union itself is being threatened by economic turmoil and the currency union shared by most of its members appears to be a massive mistake. Given the current money problems, the prize of $ 1.2 million almost seems like mockery, though some are interpreting the decision as a giant pep talk for a continent that sorely needs a reminder of what it can accomplish. Giving the prize to an organization is also unusual, but not unprecedented. Something called the international peace bureau won all"

At least, that's what appears to be the reason behind a gift trump is reportedly giving kim, to be delivered via secretary of state mike pompeo while he's in north korea this week: a cd with elton john's song \" rocket man, \" per the chosun ilbo's sources. Late last year, trump often referred to kim — and not in a complimentary way — as \" rocket man \" or \" little rocket man \" in tweets and speeches, leading kim to fire back that trump was a \" mentally deranged us dotard. \" apparently the \" rocket man \" epithet came up when the two leaders met at last month's summit in singapore, and trump discovered that kim had never heard the elton john song. And so the cd ( reportedly signed by trump ) ended up in pompeo's luggage, along with a letter to kim. Gizmodo, which calls \" rocket man \" a \" damn good song, \" notes trump seems fixated on the 1972 hit, which became a staple of sorts at his rallies while he was campaigning for the presidency. On thursday, trump once again referenced the british superstar, per billboard, noting at a rally in montana that \" i've broken more elton john [ attendance ] records, and i don't have a musical instrument. … this is my only musical instrument — the mouth — and hopefully the brain is attached to the mouth.

However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed urls to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the urls for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl ( and therefore we never got to them ).

And, despite their funny ranking, it seems chicagoans are lousy joke tellers. \"for a place that's the funniest city in the country, chicago doesn't seem to boast a lot of jokes, \" the study states. \"many chicago residents surveyed noted that they could not think of any zingers, since they prefer to mine observational humor from the situations in which they find themselves. Such remarks seem to fit with the city's professional comedy scene, since the city is known as a mecca for improv and stand-up. \" other cities in the top 10 were: boston, atlanta, washington, portland, ore., new york, los angeles, denver, san francisco and seattle. Indianapolis, detroit and milwaukee were 25th, 34th and 39th respectively. The study was led by peter mcgraw, an associate professor of marketing and psychology at cu-boulder's leeds school of business. The project grew out of mcgraw's new book, \"the humor code: a global search for what makes things funny, \" which he co-authored with journalist joel warner. \"the result was a window into the humor profiles of each of the top 10 cities, \"",

The men reportedly used the saw to cut holes in the metal walls of their cells, and the holes \" led to a cavernous utility bowel inside the prison where the men spliced an electrical cord into a light fixture to power the saw they then used to cut a large hole in a 24-inch steam pipe that led to a sewer outside the prison, \" the albany paper reports. The final barrier to freedom was a lock on the inside of a manhole cover, which they bashed with a sledgehammer. Authorities say the woman or someone else might have had second thoughts and scrapped a plan to pick them up friday night. This is matt's third escape attempt, his son tells the buffalo news. The first was from a prison near buffalo in 1986 ( he climbed a wall and remained free for five days ) and the second was in 1997 after he got captured in mexico. \"he said he made it up to the roof of the prison and got shot in the shoulder, \" says his son, who adds that his father has a \" genius iq. \"",

            "Dannemora a violent melee between two factions of inmates broke out in a recreation yard at clinton correction facility five days before two inmates on an \" honor block \" used tools to cut their way out of the maximum security prison. The fight took place june 1 when two groups of inmates — some of whom were muslim and others who were suspected members of the bloods gang — began fighting, according to a person briefed on the case. Correction officers in two towers overlooking the yard fired canisters of chemical agents into the middle of the fight, which ended in less than a minute, the person said. An inmate suffered a broken leg. Part of the prison was locked down the next day, four days before the escape, but only the yard and two cellblocks were searched, rather than the entire prison, which houses about 3,000 inmates. Five weapons were found during the searches. A person close to the case said some correction officers are questioning whether a request to lock down and search the entire facility was rebuffed by department of corrections and community supervision headquarters in albany.

        "summary": "Donald trump is planning another trip outside his comfort zone with a visit to an african-american church in detroit on saturday, and he wasn't planning on taking any risks, according to a leaked script seen by the new york times. The script contains a dozen questions that bishop wayne t. Jackson of great faith ministries international was apparently planning to ask trump in a closed-door session — and, more unusually for such an appearance, lengthy prepared answers for trump. \" i treasure my relationship with my family, and through them, i have a strong faith enriched by an ever-wonderful god, \" was trump's prepared answer for a question about whether he is a christian. \" i want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance, \" trump was directed to say after a question about his vision for black americans. After the script was leaked, a trump campaign spokesman said the agenda has now changed and trump plans to speak to the congregation directly after his interview session with the pastor. In other coverage: the detroit free press looks at the uphill struggle trump will have in order to win votes in detroit, where mitt romney got just 2 % of the vote in 2012. Some analysts believe the real purpose of trump's visit is to show moderate republicans elsewhere that he is willing to reach out to different groups of voters. The washington post analyzes trump's latest proposals on immigration, and finds that immigration enforcement costs would leap by more than $ 50 billion over the next few years in order to put his plan into action. Politico looks at the state of the trump campaign with 22 days to go before early voting begins. There has been some progress in areas including getting the candidate to stay on-message, but the campaign remains \" transitory and unstable, \" with many aides unsure who is calling the shots. At fivethirtyeight, nate silver notes that the race is tightening as it nears the home stretch — and warns that clinton supporters are mistaken if they think the electoral college math will save her if it continues to tighten. The wall street journal reports that in his big immigration speech in arizona wednesday, trump had originally planned to avoid mentioning a border wall. He changed his mind and added a line about mexico paying for the wall after finding out that mexican president enrique peña nieto had told reporters that he told trump mexico wouldn't pay. \" i had no choice, \" trump, who thought they had an agreement not to discuss the wall at their first meeting, tells the journal. Trump adviser rudy giuliani was at the meeting and says that when peña nieto declared",

            "Want these election updates emailed to you right when they're published? sign up here. The race between hillary clinton and donald trump has tightened. Clinton, whose lead over trump exceeded 8 percentage points at her peak following the democratic convention, is ahead by 4 or 5 percentage points today, according to our polls-only forecast. The tighter margins in the polls, which reflect a loss of support for clinton along with a modest improvement for trump, have come gradually over the past few weeks. The evidence of a tightening has become more widespread, however, and it's particularly clear in polls that surveyed the race just after the conventions and are retaking its temperature now. Fox news's national poll, for instance, had clinton up by 9 points just after the conventions ( in the version of the poll that included third-party candidates ) and has her up by 2 points now. There isn't any guarantee that trump will continue to gain ground. Over the course of the year, polls have oscillated between showing a dead heat at trump's best moments and a lead of 8 to 10 percentage points for clinton at her peaks. We're about halfway between those goal posts now. It's plausible that the recent shift reflects clinton's convention bounce wearing off — reversion",
            "The plan to get to 270 electoral votes remains unclear. The battleground state deployment plan is a work in progress. Money from big donors is slowing to a trickle. And aides are confused about who's calling the shots. Donald trump's campaign is teetering, threatening to collapse under the weight of a candidate whose personality outweighs his political skill. And now, with 22 days until the start of early voting, the gop nominee is running short on his most precious commodity: time. Story continued below late last week, with labor day and the final stretch of the 2016 campaign approaching, trump's son-in-law, jared kushner, met with republican national committee brass — including chief of staff katie walsh and political director chris carr — in new york city. Kushner, who has in many respects assumed the role of campaign manager, asked a series of direct questions to the gop officials — all surrounding the troubles the party was having in deploying field staffers, opening up swing-state headquarters, and establishing field offices in battlegrounds that will decide the election. Those present for the meeting, and those briefed on it, insisted there were no fireworks, no drag-out fights. But they said kushner's questions reflected a growing realization within trump's team that for all the party's talk about implementing"

        "summary": "Less than 24 hours ago, fiat chrysler was anticipating hitting its 2018 financial targets. On thursday, the automaker came under fire from the epa, per reuters, with the agency alleging fiat chrysler cheated on diesel emissions — just a day after six volkswagen honchos were indicted in that company's own scandal. In fiat chrysler's case, the epa — which was to announce its findings in a thursday morning conference call — believes the automaker's software permitted emissions beyond what's allowed by the law, in more than 100,000 suvs and trucks sold since 2014. This reported violation \" can result in harmful pollution in the air we breathe, \" an epa assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance tells the ap. Usa today reports that the epa has the ability to fine up to $ 44,539 for any vehicle that flouts the clean air act, meaning fiat chrysler could have to cough up around $ 4.5 billion. Fiat chrysler automobiles shares were halted thursday morning after the company's biggest intraday plummet since it began trading on the nyse in 2014, with shares falling as much as 18 % before settling at a 16 % decline right before trading stopped just after 11am est. Reuters'sources say fiat chrysler contests the epa's take, but a statement offered by the automaker and cited on bloomberg contends all of fiat chrysler's diesel vehicles meet \" applicable regulatory requirements \" and that the company will work with \" the incoming administration to resolve this matter fairly and equitably. \"",

These additives are found in everything from yogurt and baked goods to sauces and diet colas, per the cbc, with \" a lot of people...

Azad, the co-author of a new study published monday in the canadian medical association journal, also notes that 40 % of adults report using artificial sweeteners on a regular basis — which may prove pointless when it comes to dropping pounds, as her team has found no evidence that the sweeteners help with weight loss and may even cause other health issues. Azad's team conducted a meta analysis of 37 previously published studies of the diets of nearly 407,000 people, only seven of which were randomized control trials. \" a lot of the studies we found were observational, meaning they could show a link, but they can't prove a cause-and-effect relationship, \" she tells ctv news. Among the seven more-rigorous trials, regular consumption of artificial sweeteners had no significant effect on weight loss, while among the 30 observational studies, regular consumption was tied to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as \" modest \" weight gain. Possible reasons for the weight gain, per azad: our bodies may metabolize based on sweetness perception ( not sugar content ), gut bacteria affected by sweeteners may affect obesity, or we may give ourselves permission to eat more sweets after eating diet products. An internal medicine expert says the studies aren't clear enough to cast all blame on artificial sweeteners; azad says there isn't enough evidence the sweeteners are \" truly harmless. \" ( when it comes to higher blood sugar, gut bacteria may play a role. )",

But now a cybersecurity expert from poland has revealed a new way to send messages that are otherwise undetectable through song: tiny adjustments in tempo. To test this, krzysztof szczypiorski turned to club music for its trance-like repetition and happily packed his bags for ibiza off the coast of spain, arguably the dance-club capital of the world, reports vice. ( hey, somebody's gotta do it. ) szczypiorski reports in the open journal arxiv ( it has not yet been peer reviewed ) that in experiments djing for dancers, he was able to adjust a song's tempo up or down by as much as 2 % without anyone noticing any change. By having a faster tempo represent a dash and a slower one a dot, he used apple's logic pro x digital audio workstation to manipulate the speeds of songs like \" rhythm is a dancer \" by snap ( normally 130 beats per minute ) and randomly encode the message \" steganography is a dancer \" in morse code, reports mit technology review. So long as the change in tempo was subtle enough, nobody was the wiser. ( listen here. ) his conclusion: it would be pretty simple to develop software that automatically encodes or decodes messages sent this way. An algorithm could be used to decode the message, though it's possible that some very careful listeners could do so on their own. ( music might also help your beer taste better. )",

Basically, he turned tunes that were designed to put people in a druggy trance into a method of sending secret messages across an entire open-air beach rave, without most people noticing what they're really listening to. The basic system is this: just like morse code, letters are ascribed a dot-and-line series, but the \"dot \" is a slight increase in tempo, and the \"line \" is a slight decrease.

The coffee-and-sandwich business has promised to improve its labeling following criticism at an inquest into the death of 15-year-old natasha ednan-laperouse, who died in 2016 after eating a pret baguette that contained traces of sesame. The company said an investigation was underway into a second case, in which a customer died in december after eating a supposedly dairy-free product that contained dairy protein. Pret a manger blamed a supplier of its dairy-free yoghurt. The parents of ednan-laperouse, who are campaigning for stronger allergen warnings, said sunday they were \" incredibly saddened to learn of someone else losing their life from allergens in their food. \"",
            "Pret a manger has been hit by further controversy over the weekend, as it emerged that a second customer had died after eating one of its sandwiches in 2017. The sandwich chain found itself in a escalating row with a former supplier, after it blamed the second death on an ingredient supplied by the vegan brand coyo, a claim the yoghurt company said was unfounded. It emerged on saturday that a pret customer had died in 2017 after eating a \"super-veg rainbow flatbread \" that was supposed to be dairy-free. Pret said it had been mis-sold yoghurt that forms one of the ingredients of the flatbread and which was guaranteed dairy-free but was found to contain dairy protein. The company agreed to full labelling of ingredients on all its freshly made products last week following the case of 15-year-old natasha ednan-laperouse, who was allergic to sesame and died on a flight after eating one of its baguettes bought at heathrow airport. Following the news of another death, natasha's parents, nadim and tanya ednan-laperouse, said: \"we were incredibly saddened to learn of someone else losing their life from allergens in their food. Our hearts go out to the bereaved family. \" the pair have been campaigning for allergy awareness and a change in food-labelling laws. Pret a manger to bring in full labelling after teenager's death read more the second customer, who has not been named, collapsed and died on 27 december after buying the sandwich in a shop in stall street, bath. Bath's council alerted pret to the incident and the chain said it withdrew all affected products. The firm said it had ended its contract with coyo and was taking legal action. \"subsequent testing by pret and two independent authorities found that the coyo dairy-free yoghurt contained traces of dairy protein, \" a pret spokesman said. \"this is believed to have resulted in the tragic death of a customer from an allergic reaction in december 2017."
