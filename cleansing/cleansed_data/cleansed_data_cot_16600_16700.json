        "summary": "The majority of americans believe homosexuals should be accepted by society, but the us still lags well behind many other countries in western europe and latin america when it comes to gay-friendly attitudes, according to a new survey. Pew research polled 39 countries on the acceptance of homosexuality, finding 60 % of americans were accepting, compared with 88 % in spain, 87 % in germany, and 80 % in both the czech republic and canada. Other positive countries were australia ( 79 % ), france ( 77 % ), britain ( 76 % ), argentina ( 74 % ), italy ( 74 % ), and the philippines ( 73 % ). Conversely, countries rejecting homosexuality in the study tended to be muslim nations, including many african and asian countries, reports the washington post. In most middle east and sub-saharan african countries surveyed, more than nine in 10 people surveyed said homosexuals should not be accepted. Support was just 1 % in nigeria, 2 % in tunisia and pakistan, and 3 % in egypt, ghana, jordan and indonesia. Click to see the full results at pew research.",

The decision to deploy \" large nuclear assets \" on the korean peninsula shows the us may already be preparing for such a move, said ju. Given its nuclear superiority, the us under a nationalist president trump could \" trigger off a new nuclear arms race and … bring the whole world close to a horrible catastrophe, \" he added. Woods was also rebuffed by china and russia after suggesting those countries were \" growing their stockpiles … and, in some cases, pursuing the development of new nuclear capabilities to threaten other peaceful nations. \" en route to the olympics in south korea, vice president mike pence told reporters he planned to ensure north koreans don't \" paper over the truth about their regime, \" including its \" headlong rush to develop nuclear weapons, \" though he said a meeting with north korean officials is possible, per the new york times.",

One other notable part of the financial trouble: the company would likely be in better shape had hillary clinton won the 2016 election, notes cnbc. Sales dropped more than 30 % to $ 600 million in 2017, apparently because buyers were not concerned about tougher gun laws coming into force under president trump. The company's products include the bushmaster ar-15 rifle used in the school shooting in newtown, conn., in 2012. Several families sued, and the closely watched case has reached the state's supreme court. Remington, which is headquartered in north carolina, will continue to make guns while under bankruptcy protection, reports cnn. The company has been owned by private equity group cerberus capital management, which bought up remington, bushmaster, and other gunmakers about a decade ago and rolled them into a conglomerate called freedom group. The new york times points out that sales boomed initially, with 8.6 million guns made in the us in 2012, up from 3.3 million in 2002, but have since dropped. Remington is now saddled with heavy debt, along with trouble related to its signature weapon, the model 700 bolt-action rifle, notes cnbc. The company maintains the guns are safe but has agreed to replace the triggers as part of a class-action settlement.",

Soon after cnbc's first investigation in 2010, cerberus dropped plans for an initial public offering of what was then known as the freedom group. After the 2012 massacre at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut, cerberus announced plans to exit the gun business, but could not find a buyer. Cerberus eventually let its institutional investors cash out of freedom group, which remained on cerberus ' books, eventually renamed remington outdoors."

            "While remington maintains that the guns are safe, the company has agreed to replace the triggers on millions of guns in a class action settlement. The company has refused to say whether the bankruptcy filing — which it first signaled last month — will affect the settlement. Remington said in february that the bankruptcy would be pre-packaged under an agreement with its lenders. It is not immediately clear when the company hopes to emerge from bankruptcy. Remington is owned by private equity giant cerberus, which began buying up gun companies a decade ago. Soon after cnbc's first investigation in 2010, cerberus dropped plans for an initial public offering of what was then known as the freedom group. After the 2012 massacre at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut, cerberus announced plans to exit the gun business, but could not find a buyer. Cerberus eventually let its institutional investors cash out of freedom group, which remained on cerberus ' books, eventually renamed remington outdoors."

Harvard professor george church — who new scientist calls a \" maverick geneticist \" — is leading a \" de-extinction \" team that says it's about two years away from creating a hybrid embryo combining mammoth traits with asian elephant dna. Woolly mammoths went extinct about 4,000 years ago due to human hunting and warming temperatures. But in the past few years, church and his team have managed to splice 45 mammoth edits into asian elephant dna, including ones that control for a mammoth's shaggy hair, small ears, fat layers, and more. While church and his team believe they can have a \" mammophant \" embryo in two years, it will be much longer before anyone sees one in the wild. The team wants to grow mammophants completely in a lab in order to not mess with the reproduction of endangered asian elephants, and that technology doesn't exist yet. But if his team succeeds, church says it could do a lot more than gives zoos a neat new exhibit. He tells nbc news that releasing a herd of mammophants into the arctic could fight climate change by keeping the tundra from thawing. \" they will punch down the snow in wintertime allowing cold air to come in, \" church explains.

According to mother jones, the article \" doesn't establish a definitive link between heavy kale consumption and any health problem, \" but it does raise suspicion. It describes how, after hearing health-food fans complain of symptoms similar to those of low-level thallium poisoning, molecular biologist ernie hubbard identified the toxic heavy metal in patients ' urine and in kale. He then reviewed studies published over a 15-year period and found kale, cabbage, watercress, radishes, and turnips, are particularly good at pulling thallium from soil. One patient who called herself the \" cabbage queen \" had thallium levels seven times higher than the threshold safety limit and claimed her hair was falling out \" in clumps. \" no, that doesn't mean the veggies at your local supermarket are going to make you go bald. Thallium is typically only found at concerning levels in \" nearby cement plants, oil drilling, smelting, and, most of all, in the ash that results from coal burning, \" craftmanship reports. Though hubbard couldn't pin down the source of the thallium in his kale, he suspects it might be related to coal ash spread as fertilizer, or perhaps wastewater from fracking operations — but it's all speculative for now.

Federal researchers say that over the last two decades: total cholesterol levels dropped 10 points ( 206 to 196 mg/dl ) bad cholesterol levels ( ldl ) dropped from 129 to 116 good cholesterol levels ( hdl ) rose from 50.7 to 52.5 \"these findings are important because individuals with high levels of total or 'bad ' cholesterol have a greater chance of developing heart disease, one of the leading causes of death in the united states, \" the lead cdc author tells abc news. What's striking is that the decline holds true even for people not taking cholesterol-lowering drugs, which means that a reduction in trans fats, a drop in smoking rates, and generally healthier lifestyles are likely playing a role, reports medpagetoday.com.",

Now, president trump has plans to meet with megumi yokota's parents when he visits japan next month, with pm shinzo abe arranging the details, the guardian reports. Trump had first mentioned megumi during last month's un general assembly speech, in which he threatened to \" totally destroy \" north korea if he had to. \" we know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for north korea's spies, \" trump said then. Sakie yokota told nk news \" it's a big surprise to hear that president trump is willing to meet us, \" adding via the kyodo agency she was \" thankful \" to him for the gesture. She and her husband, shigeru, now in their 80s, didn't find out megumi had been kidnapped by north korea until 1997, when a defected spy spilled the story. They're hoping trump's visit will pressure the north to offer up more info on those who were taken. Of the 17 japanese officially listed as being abducted ( activists say there could be up to a hundred more ), five were released after kim jong il admitted to the kidnappings in 2002; north korea claimed four never made it across the border, while seven others died of sickness or in accidents. As for megumi, the north said she'd taken her own life in 1994, though remains sent to japan in 2004 didn't match megumi's dna. Per the new york times, megumi's parents met their 26-year-old north korean-born granddaughter ( megumi's daughter ) and great-grandchild at a secret 2014 meeting in mongolia.",

After languishing in internet obscurity for nearly a year, another reddit user requested more information, asking: \" do these seemingly random strings of numbers... Correlate to something; is there some big joke i ' m missing out on? \" there was no reply, but enough people began to wonder the same thing themselves, and soon a sister subreddit, r/solving_a858, was born. It consisted of \" a dedicated group of computer science students, amateur cryptographers, and motivated enthusiasts \" working together to crack the code, if indeed that's what it was, reports the daily dot. At first the creator kept the subreddit private, with only those proving themselves worthy allowed in, but it eventually opened to the public. Today only a few of the thousands of r/a858 posts have been decoded, but they themselves tend to be cryptic — such as an excerpt from the book actions and passions by max lerner, and the ascii image of stonehenge, reported bustle last year. The subreddit creator was pretty much silent until august 2015 when an account appeared in the sister \" solving \" subreddit that ( after appropriate code-breaking, of course ) allowed users to ask questions. Still, any answers were themselves cryptic, such as: \" we cannot disclose the purpose. A858 will end when the purpose is disclosed or discovered. \" then on march 29, after having been private for some time ( it switches between private and public regularly ), r/a858 suddenly read: \" the a858 project has concluded. You may unsubscribe. \" many still think the project isn't over. \" i only hope a858 actually has a purpose, \" one user writes. \" i don't particularly care if it is a good one. \" ( see how this reddit user helped solve a 20-year-old mystery. )",

Are they intentionally creepy? not all of them, no; but there's always an element of fear lying somewhere in the depths of the unknown. And let's face it: even though the internet puts a wealth of knowledge and information at our fingertips, there is still so much about the world that we don't understand — even when it comes to the internet itself. We all log onto it every day, checking our email, posting our statuses, looking up exactly what that word you heard on your favorite podcast during your morning commute means... But very few of us actually know how the internet works. While it's true that you don't need to understand what's under the hood of something to appreciate everything it can do for you, it's still kind of odd that we all surf the web so thoughtlessly much of the time, isn't it? given all this, then, it's perhaps unsurprising that the internet has its secrets, the same as anyone else. We may never get to the heart of these wacky unsolved mysteries... But that's not going to stop us from trying to figure them out, is it? or, at the very least, freaking ourselves out over them. Because we all just love to be scared.

But because he wanted to be \" unconditionally alone, \" knight had to make some ethical concessions when it came to eating — meaning he had to start to steal. Knight put the same meticulous study into his new life of crime as he did in building shelters and foraging in the forest. Sometimes he'd lie low for hours to make sure a target location was safe. \" i enjoy being in the dark, \" he says. He was so good at what he did that his victims felt \" begrudging respect \" for the spotless crime scenes he left behind. His life alone finally ended after 27 years when he was caught and arrested for burglary and theft while trying to scoop up food from a camp. Locals couldn't wait to hear what the \" hermit \" had to say about his time alone, how he survived, and why he left in the first place back in the ' 80s. Knight has thought long and hard about that last question, and after ruling out religious, artistic, or anti-modern society reasons, he simply says: \" it's a mystery. \" the rest of knight's incredible survival tale here.

But gov.

        "summary": "\" our findings expose a threat to the privacy and safety of gay men and women, \" wrote michal kosinski in a paper set to be published by the journal of personality and social psychology — only he's the one now finding himself in danger. The new york times takes a look at the quagmire kosinski finds himself in following his decision to try — and, in some fashion, succeed — at building what many are referring to as \" ai gaydar. \" the stanford graduate school of business professor tells the times he decided to attempt to use facial recognition analysis to determine whether someone is gay to flag how such analysis could reveal the very things we want to keep private. Now he's getting death threats. The times delves into the research — first highlighted by the economist in early september — and the many bones its many critics have to pick with it. Kosinski and co-author yilun wang pulled 35,000 photos of white americans from online dating sites ( those looking for same-sex partners were classified as gay ) and ran them through a \" widely used \" facial analysis program that turns the location, size, and shape of one's facial characteristics into numbers. Humans who looked at the photos correctly identified a woman as gay or straight 54 % of the time, and men 61 %; the program, when given five photos per person, got it right 83 % of the time for women and 91 % for men. One critic explains that while 91 % might sound impressive, it's not. In a scenario where 50 out of every 1,000 people are gay, the program would identify 130 as gay (.91 correct times 50 and.09 wrong times 950 ); it would be right about 45 of those people, and wrong about 85.

Medical researchers have trained ai in smartphones to detect cancerous lesions; a google system can make precise guesses about the year a photograph was taken, simply because it has seen more photos than a human could ever inspect, and has spotted patterns that no human could. Ai's power to pick out patterns is now turning to more intimate matters.

Given a single facial image, a classifier could correctly distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81 % of cases, and in 74 % of cases for women. Human judges achieved much lower accuracy: 61 % for men and 54 % for women. The accuracy of the algorithm increased to 91 % and 83 %, respectively, given five facial images per person. Facial features employed by the classifier included both fixed ( e.g., nose shape ) and transient facial features ( e.g., grooming style ). Consistent with the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation, gay men and women tended to have gender-atypical facial morphology, expression, and grooming styles. Prediction models aimed at gender alone allowed for detecting gay males with 57 % accuracy and gay females with 58 % accuracy. Those findings advance our understanding of the origins of sexual orientation and the limits of human perception.

After speaking with numerous other friends of mine from across the country, i have decided to start this petition to ask starbucks to please change the ingredients of this beloved beverage so that all of their loyal patrons may enjoy it every autumn -- even the vegans and lactose-intolerant customers! many people are shocked to hear that the mix contains condensed milk because there's no way anyone would be able to tell walking into a store and placing an order. Employees don't even realize it has milk in it! a previous petition on change.org convinced starbucks to stop using crushed bugs as a food coloring because that just doesn't make sense regardless of if you're vegan or not. This also makes sense regardless of if you're vegan or lactose-intolerant or not because nothing about ' pumpkin"

            "Penn state nittany lions defensive coordinator tom bradley shown on the sideline against kent state at beaver stadium in september, 2010. ( rob christy/us presswire ) — penn state introduced its first new head football coach in nearly half a century on thursday, even as state college recovered from the riot that followed the firing of legendary coach joe paterno and the board of trustees met on how to contain the fallout. About 9: 30 p.m., the university announced that assistant coach mike mcqueary, who told a grand jury he saw former coach jerry sandusky sexually assault a young boy in 2002, will not attend saturday's home game against nebraska because of \" multiple threats \" made against him. With paterno fired and university president graham spanier tendering his resignation, mcqueary has emerged as the focus of media ire, with commentators questioning why the former penn state quarterback didn't stop the alleged sexual encounter. Earlier thursday, interim coach tom bradley said mcqueary would be at saturday's game, but his role was undetermined. A trustee who asked not to be identified said the trustees did not want mcqueary on the field out of fear for his safety. Penn state interim president rodney erickson emerged from a trustees meeting telling reporters to \" stay tuned \" for more on mcqueary. Later, the university issued this statement: \"",
            "No matter who has the most points, no one wins in this situation state college, pa. - for penn state wide receiver derek moye, the fallout from the sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the university affects the two coaches with whom he works the most. Receivers coach mike mcqueary, a central figure in the scandal who said he witnessed an incident in the showers between former assistant coach jerry sandusky and a 10-year-old boy, will not be at saturday's game against nebraska at beaver stadium. Penn state officials made the announcement in a brief statement thursday night: \" due to multiple threats made against assistant coach mike mcqueary, the university has decided it would be in the best interest of all for assistant coach mcqueary not to be in attendance at saturday's nebraska game. \" then there is quarterbacks coach jay paterno, son of the now-former head coach of the nittany lions who will not have his father around for the first time in his 17 years on the staff.

        "summary": "More bad news on the health effects of diet soda, specifically in regard to people 65 and older. Those who drink the stuff daily gain significantly more belly fat — a particularly dangerous kind of fat, say researchers in eureka alert. Specifically, study subjects who drank diet soda every day gained 3.2 inches around the waist over a decade, compared with 0.8 inches for those who drank none. Occasional drinkers fell between the two at 1.8 inches. That's especially troubling because belly fat is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other health ailments including diabetes, says one of the researchers at the university of texas health science center at san antonio. So why does \" diet \" soda cause weight gain? that part remains unclear, but another researcher explains to time that the artificial sweeteners used to replace sugar might be messing with the body's natural signals. \"your body is used to knowing that a sweet taste means you are ingesting energy in the form of calories that, if you don't burn them off, is going to convert to fat, \" she says. The artificial sweeteners might confuse that message. For those hooked on the taste, the study team recommends eating sweet fruit and washing it down with water, and those who drink diet soda for a jolt can shift to tea or coffee, reports livescience. ( another study found that artificial sweeteners might actually raise blood-sugar levels. )",

Metabolic syndrome -- a combination of risk factors that may lead to high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke -- is one of the results of the obesity epidemic. In fact, the world health organization ( who ) estimates that 1.9 billion adults were overweight ( body mass index [ bmi ] of 25 or more ) in 2014.

Among the people who drank diet soda only occasionally, the increase was more than double that of those who did not drink diet soda. \" the more people drank diet sodas, the more their waistlines expanded, \" said study author sharon fowler, a researcher at the university of texas health science center at san antonio.

In a may 2016 study published in the journal jama pediatrics, researchers studied over 3,000 pregnant women and their infants and found that mothers that frequently consumed diet beverages ( drinks with artificial sweeteners ) were two times more likely to have babies who were overweight or obese at one year after birth compared to women who consumed fewer artificially sweetened drinks. While the study doesn't prove that diet drinks and artificial sweeteners cause weight gain, it certainly isn't doing the trend any favors. Another 2015 study published in the journal of the american geriatrics society found that people who drank diet soda gained almost triple the abdominal fat over nine years as those who didn't drink diet soda.

The cases are linked by dna evidence and similarities in their circumstances; victims were threatened with a knife ( in some cases he showed it, in others not ), and some of the locations were similar: centennial park and near the bondi to bronte coastal walkway. But no matches were found in running the dna against australia's database or international records, reports aap. Police say the \" blitz attack \" rapes, which \" were committed very, very quickly with very little warning to the victim, \" occurred between 1985 and 2001; news.com.au reports his victims ranged from ages 14 to 55. The perpetrator is now thought to be between the ages of 45 and 64, though aap reports that police acknowledge he could be dead or have moved to another country. He's described as having an australian accent, dark complexion, brown eyes, dark hair, a broad nose, and a changing build — thin in the 1980s, then, a decade later, medium and even muscular. \" we have now reached the point where we're seeking help from the public, \" detective acting superintendent mick haddow with the new south wales police said monday. He said there is no person of interest at this time, and no information on the man post-2001.",

But, thanks to a purveyor of internet pornography, things are looking up for the 48-year-old mother of two in san antonio, texas. Uribe has been announced as the recipient of a $ 25,000 college scholarship courtesy of pornhub, reports the san antonio express-news. Uribe, who holds an associate degree, will now pursue a bachelor's in political science. \" i busted out crying, \" uribe tells the newspaper. Pornhub launched its controversial scholarship contest earlier this year. Hopefuls had to be at least 18, have a 3.2 gpa or higher, and submit an essay and video answering the question, \" how do you strive to make others happy? \" uribe's entry rose above more than 1,000 others because \"she's been through a lot \" and \" she really stood up for herself, \" pornhub vp corey price tells the washington post. In 2011, uribe sued after claiming she was fired from her job as an office manager at a legal office for refusing to illegally solicit clients, a practice known informally as ambulance chasing and more formally as barratry, explains the express-news. The two attorneys who ran the office said she was disgruntled and making it up, but they were subsequently indicted on federal charges of barratry and are awaiting trial. In 2014, one of the attorneys, paul andrews, was arrested for allegedly offering a client reduced legal fees in exchange for having \" something happen to uribe. \" he's now facing charges of solicitation of murder. The whole thing has left uribe with a host of psychological disorders, including agoraphobia and ptsd. \" every little thing sets me off, \" she tells the post. But, she adds to the express-news, \" it's not going to keep me down. \" ( a different type of porn site is battling \" silicon valley prudes. \" )",

Ending a 70-year ban on publishing mein kampf in german, the team from the institute for contemporary history will be releasing a two-volume, 2,000-page edition of the work, with an enhanced layout that features hitler's original text on one side of each two-page spread, and editorial annotations ( around 3,500 in total ) on the other, the new york times reports. \" we wanted literally to surround hitler with our comments, \" christian hartmann, the project's leader, tells the paper, while ich director andreas wirsching notes to the bbc that republishing the book will \" shatter the myth \" surrounding it. Mein kampf was banned by the allies at the end of wwii, and the copyright was handed over to the state of bavaria, which has denied others republishing rights since out of respect for holocaust victims and to avoid incitement, per the guardian. But that copyright expires on dec. 31, meaning the book is now fair game for republishing once again. \" this is really one of the best relics we have of the third reich, \" hartmann tells the times. Not everyone agrees with the redo: an 83-year-old jewish leader in munich labels mein kampf a \" disgusting incitement to hatred and the basis of the holocaust \" and says it should warrant no further discussions, her spokesman tells the times. More than 200 preorders have been placed for the $ 63 book, though hartmann notes he has no clue how well the first run of nearly 4,000 copies will ultimately sell: he previously worked on a book about hitler's 1920s- ' 30s speeches, and \" the public interest was almost zero, \" he tells the times.

        "summary": "The latest version of president trump's travel ban took effect thursday evening with a last-minute change: fiances have been added to the list of people considered \" close \" relatives, the bbc reports. But grandparents, aunts, and uncles, among others, aren't considered close enough — and without what the administration deems a close relative or business relationship, travelers from six muslim-majority nations and would-be refugees from around the world can be denied entry. Hawaii filed an emergency court challenge to the ban late thursday, taking issue with the trump administration's interpretation of the supreme court ruling reinstating parts of the ban. The latest: the motion filed by hawaii state lawyers argues that the trump administration is defining \" close relative \" too narrowly, politico reports. They also say refugees with longstanding connections to us resettlement agencies should be exempt from the ban, which makes exceptions for people with \" bona fide \" ties to us entities. They argue that the administration shouldn't ban refugees \" who already have a documented agreement with a local sponsor and a place to live. \" previously issued visas are still being honored, unlike during the initial introduction of the travel ban in january, meaning there was far less chaos at airports this time around, the guardian reports. There were fewer protests, though volunteers at airports including jfk and lax gathered to see if any travelers needed legal assistance. Administration officials say the list of relatives is based on the immigration and nationality act of 1965. A senior administration official says those who feel they deserve exemptions, such as people raised by their grandmothers, are welcome to \" articulate that reason \" to authorities, reports the washington post. \" we will look at those cases case by case, but it won't be the relationship that will be the determining factor, \" the official says. Civil rights groups say they will challenge the new version of the ban, which they say is arbitrary and in violation of the supreme court ruling, the new york times reports. \" it remains clear that president trump's purpose is to disparage and condemn muslims, \" says omar jadwat of the aclu's immigrants ' rights project. Reuters reports that a senior administration official, when asked how banning grandparents or grandchildren would make the us safer, cited trump's plan to pause \" certain travel while we review our security posture. \"",

She speaks to the guardian in what kate connolly describes as \" one of the first, and last, in-depth interviews of her life, \" spurred by the release of a documentary about her called a german life. So many decades later, pomsel is \" unrepentant, \" writes connolly, insisting there is nothing weighing on her conscience and that she \" really... Didn't do anything other than type. \" in the film she casts herself as too \" dumb \" and \" superficial \" to comprehend what was happening, reports the new york times. That's not to say all that typing was innocuous: she recalls beefing up the count of the number of women raped by red army soldiers, and expresses pride that goebbels trusted her with the case file of a young woman who was executed for treason. In terms of other recollections, haaretz reports the film provides little untold insight into goebbels beyond an affection so deep for his dog that he once had it flown to him in venice, \" but it does shed light on human nature. \" as for eva löwenthal, her jewish friend who went missing, pomsel says she completely accepted the story that was being told: that jews were sent to empty homes in czech lands germany had annexed. It wasn't until 2005 that she sought the truth of löwenthal's fate: records showed her friend ended up in auschwitz in november 1943 and was dead by the war's end.

The planeload of around 40 people from a new mexico detention center is just the \" initial wave \" and their deportation came at president obama's direction, a homeland security official tells the los angeles times. \" our border is not open to illegal migration and we will send recent illegal migrants back, \" he says. There will be more flights to honduras, guatemala, and el salvador in the days and weeks ahead, the official tells nbc, which notes that false rumors of a june deadline to stay in the us legally has fueled a spike in arrivals of women and children from central america. An unprecedented wave of around 40,000 mothers with children and at least 57,000 unaccompanied minors have arrived in the us so far this year. Obama, who says most will be sent back to their troubled homelands, has requested $ 3.7 billion to deal with the influx. Two texas lawmakers plan to introduce a bipartisan bill today that will make it easier to send migrant children back by amending a 2008 law that gave them extra legal protection, the new york times reports. \" my guess is that once the word gets back to guatemala, honduras and elsewhere that, ' look, it's not a free pass. This permiso doesn't work. They actually will send you back,'that people will not start the journey, \" says texas sen. John cornyn, the senate's no. 2 republican.",

The exact number differs in various accounts, but somewhere between 30 and 40 people were killed when a fire broke out in a building there. Police haven't released details on how the fire started or even who the victims were, but the blaze followed rioting between pro-ukraine and pro-russia groups in the city, reports reuters. The ap quotes ukraine media reports as saying that the pro-kiev group broke up an encampment of their rivals outside the building, and the pro-russian group then took refuge inside it. The fire broke out soon after, with the best guess being that a molotov cocktail set it off, either intentionally or by accident. The heaviest fighting of the day, however, continued to take place in slovyansk. Ukraine troops had control of the outskirts by evening, reports the new york times, and were expected to continue their push tomorrow. The wall street journal notes that us ambassador samantha power has expressed concern about \" very alarming words from russian diplomats \" about the need for peacekeeping. Moscow used the same rationale for previous invasions of georgia and moldova, notes the journal.

The memo, sent by douglas band, lays out how he and his company, teneo, helped secure donations for the clinton foundation while lining up paid gigs for bill clinton. According to salon, the memo says teneo helped raise more than $ 150 million for the foundation. At the same time, band says he secured tens of millions of dollars in income for bill clinton. For example, he got financial company ubs to donate $ 540,000 to the clinton foundation; he also got ubs to pay bill clinton $ 900,000 personally to give three speeches, the new york daily news reports. The memo was written in 2011 after chelsea clinton expressed concern about teneo's role in raising money for the clinton foundation. Band admits his methods are \" unorthodox \" but argues that his raising money for the foundation was completely separate from getting paid gigs for bill clinton. \" as the memo demonstrated, teneo worked to encourage clients, where appropriate, to support the clinton foundation because of the good work that it does around the world, \" teneo said in a statement released this week. Republicans have claimed the clinton foundation allowed corporations and others to buy access to bill and hillary clinton. For example, the memo reveals coca-cola gave more than $ 4 million to the foundation between 2004 and 2010 and its chief executive was able to meet with bill clinton at home in 2009.",

Oregon and washington have seen heavy snowfall over the past week, and experts say the snow has been dense — and has fallen onto lighter snow, making it more likely to slide. Avalanche warnings are in effect for parts of the washington cascades and the mount hood area. The group was on the third day of a guided backcountry outing meant to last five days, and was comprised of two guides and six skiers, the ap reports. The owner of the company that organized the trip says they were all \" fit, proficient downhill skiers \" and that the avalanche \" caught them by surprise \" from above. The two injured skiers — one with two broken legs, another with a broken thigh bone — are still on the mountain, with medics, until conditions clear so rescue efforts can resume. So far this season, 12 people have died in avalanches, six of those since sunday.",

The deaths mean at least 12 people have died in avalanches nationally this season, including six since sunday. Low clouds and poor visibility grounded a rescue effort for the injured skiers late tuesday night, baker county undersheriff warren thompson said. Two medics were with the man and woman. Four unhurt skiers were being brought out by snowcat, a large tracked vehicle that can maneuver on snow, thompson said. The snowcat was unable to reach the injured skiers because of the incline of the slope they were on, the undersheriff said. The injured woman suffered two broken legs and a shoulder injury while the man had a broken thigh bone, thompson said. Two national guard helicopters, one each from oregon and idaho, hoped to resume rescue efforts wednesday, thompson said. They spent the night at the baker city airport.

        "summary": "Last month, peyton mccaughey's family called in fumigators to deal with the humdrum problem of termites. Today, the 10-year-old boy has lost 90 % of his motor skills, and state investigators in florida say it's because of the chemicals used in the fumigation, reports nbc news. The boy's parents this week sued terminix and a subcontractor named sunland pest control, alleging shoddy practices, reports tcpalm. Peyton \" sustained a catastrophic brain injury \" because the fumigators \" failed to properly make certain \" that the home was safe for the family to re-enter, according to the complaint. The boy, his sister, his parents, and his grandmother all quickly became sick, but peyton suffered the worst with slurred speech and muscle spasms. Everyone else recovered, but today peyton can't walk or \" even lift his head, \" says a family spokesman. The state department of agriculture and consumer services communications has suspended sunland's pest-control license as the investigation continues. Investigators found that devices sunland should have used to test the home for safety were not working properly, reports wptv. The state also says that sunland didn't participate in a training program required for the particular chemical used in the fumigation. Terminix says its \" heart goes out to the family \" but wouldn't comment further because of the pending lawsuit. Peyton's prospects for recovery are unclear, but he currently requires constant care. \" it's hopeful and encouraging that he has made some improvement but he's nowhere near the kid that he used to be, \" says his uncle, ed gribben. ( pesticides also sickened a family vacationing in the virgin islands. )",

I saw it, \" he continued, adding that while \" it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it, \" it was \" well covered at the time. \" more: trump's remarks were widely condemned as simply untrue by both parties, nj.com reports. \" clearly, trump has memory issues or willfully distorts the truth, either of which should be concerning for the republican party, \" said jersey city mayor steve fulop, a possible democratic candidate for governor. \" i think if it had happened, i would remember it, \" said nj gov.

In the abc interview, trump also refused to rule out a mandatory database to track us muslims and promised to bring back waterboarding, the times reports. On sunday, trump tweeted what the huffington post calls a \" chart of racist and wildly inaccurate crime statistics \" that appears to be aimed at \" perpetuating racist myths about black people and crime. \" the numbers in the chart bear no relation to the fbi's crime statistics, and the source is listed as the \" crime statistics bureau, san francisco, \" which does not exist",

Responding to an executive order from president obama, the social security administration is devising a policy that could add millions of its beneficiaries to the national instant criminal background check system ( nics ). In this scenario, people mentally incapable of handling their own disability payments, and those receiving payments for mental-health issues, will be reported to the nics — which exists to stop illegal immigrants, convicted drug offenders, felons, and others from buying guns. The move could add 4.7 million americans to the system and put social security in line with other federal agencies, including department of veterans affairs, which already report to nics. Told of the plan, head nra lobbyist chris cox issued a statement opposing the \" executive fiat \" and saying \" the nra stands ready to pursue all available avenues to stop them in their tracks. \" the national council on disability also appears poised to oppose the move. The policy is fallout from the sandy hook killings, where six school employees and 20 children were massacred at a connecticut elementary school in 2012. Congress later dismissed president obama's push for gun-control legislation, so the president issued 23 executive orders on gun control, including one to put federal agencies in line with laws about nics reporting. \" we need a change in attitude, \" said obama after the charleston church massacre, per cnn. \" we have to feel a sense of urgency.

The guardian reports that manning spoke before about 600 attendees at the nantucket project conference, designed to assemble innovators, with co-founder tom scott saying manning had been asked to speak for \" clarity of understanding. \" ( scott added, per politico, that there were some attendees who weren't thrilled that manning was speaking, but canceling her speech didn't cross his mind. ) manning's talk was one of her first public appearances since she was released from military prison in may after then-president obama commuted her 35-year sentence before he left office. During her sunday speech — which was initially reported on by the ap, the sole media outlet there — manning said she chose to look at being disinvited from harvard as an honor of sorts and noted that we're now living in a \" police state, \" where academic institutions don't offer a credible venue for political discourse. She said that as she left prison, she witnessed \" a dystopian novel unfolding before my eyes \" and says privacy is \" dead \" and civil disobedience is a powerful tool. As for her decision to get involved with wikileaks, in reference to pompeo's ( and others ' ) critique of her as a traitor, manning replied, \" i believe i did the best i could in my circumstances to make an ethical decision. \" she added that she'd hoped speaking publicly would \" change the tone of the conversation, \" but conceded that things have only \" gotten worse. \"",

After leaving the hospital, cirk flew home without ever meeting his would-be love interest. But zhang says we shouldn't be too quick to judge her. She says she and cirk had talked about waiting a year before meeting, so she was caught off guard by his arrival, shanghaiist reports. She says cirk had \" seemed a little callous towards me, \" so when he sent her photos of his plane tickets, \" i thought it was a joke. \" in fact, when cirk arrived at changsha, zhang was in another province having cosmetic surgery.

Photos published in polar research earlier this month show a polar bear eating a white-beaked dolphin on a fjord in svalbard, norway; the carcass of a second — \" little more than the spine, rib cage and skull \" — sat nearby. The photos, taken by norwegian polar institute scientist jon aars and his team in april 2014, are the first known evidence of the dolphin species as polar bear food. The researchers believe the dolphin pair swam too far north and were trapped under the ice, theorizing they met their deaths when they emerged for air through a hole in the ice. One of the photos shows the bear gnawing on the beak of a largely shredded dolphin. A second shows another carcass half-covered in snow, perhaps to \" decrease the likelihood of other bears, foxes, or gulls scavenging the remains, \" per the study, though the authors note \" caching \" isn't thought of as something polar bears usually do. It wasn't an isolated incident: the team spotted at least five more white-beaked dolphin carcasses that summer and fall, and six different bears eating them. Based on the dolphins ' location and condition, the researchers believe \" they were likely from the same pod and also suffered death due to entrapment in the ice in april. \" the photos make tangible the effects of a warming arctic and a changing ecosystem. Dolphins could become a part of the bears'diet, observes bloomberg, calling it \" good news \" for bears as their access to seals shrinks. Still, \" i don't think that this signifies a great upheaval \" in their diet, aars tells discovery. ( solar-eclipse tourists better watch out, too. )",

Their spotted brown or tan fur allows harbor seals to blend in with sand and rocks. Unlike their very vocal relatives -- sea lions and elephant seals -- harbor seals are quiet creatures that make little noise. They like to hang out on beaches, sand bars and rocks during low tide to bask in the sun and sleep, but they never go far from the water. At the slightest"

The comic book was purchased by an anonymous collector, and heritage auctions says thursday's sale is a record for a public auction price for any spider-man comic book, reports the ap. The 1962 edition of \" amazing fantasy \" no. 15 was graded as near-mint, with a score of 9.4 on a scale of 1 to 10. In a look at the seller in advance of the sale, the ap reported that walter yakoboski scraped together nearly every penny he made as short-order cook in 1979 to begin buying a small collection of rare comic books for $ 10,000, hoping his boyhood passion could one day pay off as an investment. The 60-year-old long island man purchased the \" amazing fantasy \" issue for $ 1,200 in 1980. Its cover, featuring a price of 12 cents, shows spider-man clutching a villain in one arm and swinging from his web with the other. Yakoboski wants to use the proceeds to buy his late father's 17-acre vegetable farm in calverton. In 2011, a private collector reportedly paid $ 1.1 million for another near-mint copy.

From hell chronicles the tale of jack the ripper. There has been many a book about the infamous serial killer, but this one is different. It explores the world through the eyes of ripper himself, and jumps to everyone who's affected by him. Moore creates complex characters and sets them in gritty, unapologetic, uncensored london.

        "summary": "Medications do more than treat an illness: certain ones may also make you more considerate or selfish. A new study finds two common medications, an antidepressant and a treatment for parkinson's disease, actually alter your moral compass, reports medical daily. Researchers assigned 89 healthy people a dose of the serotonin-boosting anti-depressant citalopram or a placebo, while 86 healthy people were given the dopamine-enhancing drug levodopa or a placebo. They were then separated into pairs of \" deciders \" and \" receivers. \" in each of 170 trials, deciders chose to receive a certain number of mildly painful electric shocks for payment, up to 20 shocks and $ 30 per trial. The catch was that they also decided how many shocks would be given to the anonymous receiver, for which the decider — not the receiver — would be paid. Those who took citalopram were prepared to fork over an average equivalent of about 92 cents to avoid a shock and $ 1.12 to prevent harm to others, compared to 54 cents and 68 cents, respectively, from those in the placebo group. That suggests citalopram made participants more considerate of other people's pain. On the flip side, those who took levodopa were willing to pay 54 cents to prevent a shock to others or themselves. \" the dopamine drug made people more selfish, \" a researcher tells the guardian. \" most people show this pattern where they think it's worse to harm other people than to harm oneself. That's abolished by the drug. \" another researcher says the experiment shows \" how serotonin and dopamine affect people's willingness to harm others for personal gain \" but raises \" important ethical questions about the use of such drugs, \" per a press release.

A panel of scientists yesterday reversed its december decision and concluded that two revised papers on the h5n1 virus were good to go. The board created controversy last year when it asked two scientific journals, for the first time, to keep key details under wraps. The decision clears the way for science and nature to publish the papers soon, notes ap. Although h5n1 is deadly in humans, it usually cannot be contracted by people. Two research teams modified the flu strain to make it more easily contagious, leading to fears the technique could be used by terrorists. However, the research \"did not appear to provide information that would immediately enable misuse of the research in ways that would endanger public health or national security, \" said the national science advisory board for biosecurity. Not everyone is happy with the decision, though. \"this work should never have been performed, \" said one bioweapons expert.",

            "The u.s. Government's biosecurity advisers said friday they support publishing research studies showing how scientists made new easy-to-spread forms of bird flu because the studies, now revised, don't reveal details bioterrorists could use. The decision could end a debate that began in december when the government took the unprecedented step of asking the scientists not to publicize all the details of their work. The research, by two scientific teams _ one in wisconsin, the other in the netherlands _ was funded by the united states. It was an effort to learn more about the potential threat from bird flu in asia. The virus so far doesn't spread easily among people. But the new lab-made viruses spread easily among ferrets, suggesting they would also spread among humans. Last year, after reviewing earlier versions of the papers, the national science advisory board for biosecurity said publishing full details would be too risky. The federal government agreed. Scientists around the world debated the matter. Many argued that full publication would help scientists track dangerous mutations in natural bird flu viruses and test vaccines and treatments. On friday, board members, meeting in washington, announced they are satisfied with the revised papers. The panel's advice now goes to the u.s. Department of health and human services for a decision. The board unanimously supported publication of",
            "After a public furor over experiments that made a dangerous flu virus more contagious, a panel of scientific advisers reversed itself on friday and recommended that full details of the research be published in scientific journals. Dr. Paul keim, acting chairman of the panel, said the new manuscripts made it clear that the experiments were not as dangerous as they originally appeared to be and that the benefits of the research were greater. The benefits come from information that can be used to help predict which flu viruses circulating in the environment may be developing pandemic potential. The panel, the national science advisory board for biosecurity, recommended in december that scientific reports about the research be published only if certain details were withheld, to prevent others from replicating the experiments.

            "The u.s. Government's biosecurity advisers said friday they support publishing research studies showing how scientists made new easy-to-spread forms of bird flu because the studies, now revised, don't reveal details bioterrorists could use. The decision could end a debate that began in december when the government took the unprecedented step of asking the scientists not to publicize all the details of their work. The research, by two scientific teams _ one in wisconsin, the other in the netherlands _ was funded by the united states. It was an effort to learn more about the potential threat from bird flu in asia. The virus so far doesn't spread easily among people. But the new lab-made viruses spread easily among ferrets, suggesting they would also spread among humans. Last year, after reviewing earlier versions of the papers, the national science advisory board for biosecurity said publishing full details would be too risky. The federal government agreed. Scientists around the world debated the matter. Many argued that full publication would help scientists track dangerous mutations in natural bird flu viruses and test vaccines and treatments. On friday, board members, meeting in washington, announced they are satisfied with the revised papers. The panel's advice now goes to the u.s. Department of health and human services for a decision. The board unanimously supported publication of",
            "After a public furor over experiments that made a dangerous flu virus more contagious, a panel of scientific advisers reversed itself on friday and recommended that full details of the research be published in scientific journals. Dr. Paul keim, acting chairman of the panel, said the new manuscripts made it clear that the experiments were not as dangerous as they originally appeared to be and that the benefits of the research were greater. The benefits come from information that can be used to help predict which flu viruses circulating in the environment may be developing pandemic potential. The panel, the national science advisory board for biosecurity, recommended in december that scientific reports about the research be published only if certain details were withheld, to prevent others from replicating the experiments. The fear was that bioterrorists would use the information to create germ weapons, or that the virus would leak out of a laboratory by accident.

        "summary": "A brazilian presidential candidate who has campaigned on getting tough on violent crime was stabbed in the guts while mixing with the public at a rally thursday — and analysts say it could secure his victory. Jair bolsonaro, a 63-year-old whose divisive, right-wing policies have earned him the nickname \" brazil's trump, \" was hospitalized in serious condition after he was stabbed at the rally in juiz de fora, 125 miles north of rio de janeiro, the guardian reports. Doctors say he suffered intestinal injuries after being stabbed below his bulletproof vest and will be in the hospital for at least a week. The suspected attacker, 40-year-old adelio bispo de oliveira, was arrested within moments. \" our agents there said the attacker said he was ' on a mission from god, ' \" luis boudens, president of the national federation of federal police, tells the ap. \" their impression is that they were not dealing with a mentally stable person. \" bolsonaro has angered many — and faces criminal charges — for his attacks on women, black people, gays, and others, but polls suggest he could win the first round of voting on oct. 7. Polls say former president luiz inacio lula da silva could beat bolsonaro, but he's in prison on corruption charges and a court rejected his candidacy last week. It's a \" surreal situation, \" writes the bbc's katy watson, who notes that bolsonaro becoming a victim of violent crime \" plays into the hands of his supporters. \"",

In a moving facebook post, he notes that at the time the 2010 photo was taken, he had been flying under the radar because he was \" suicidal \" and suffering from deep depression, an issue that's affected him since childhood and that he's since discussed openly. \" but at the time i suffered in silence, \" he writes. \" ashamed and in pain, i considered myself damaged goods. And the voices in my head urged me down the path to self-destruction. \" he adds he's glad that picture survived, however. \" i am reminded of my struggle, \" he writes. \" my endurance and my perseverance in the face of all kinds of demons. … like a dandelion up through the pavement, i persist. \" he ends by encouraging others who are struggling to reach out for help, as well as noting that \" the meaning i assign to this/my image is strength. Healing. Forgiveness. Of myself and others. \" meanwhile, a lad bible facebook post tuesday apologized to miller, saying \" we've got this very, very wrong \" and adding \" mental health is no joke or laughing matter. \" \" causing distress and upset to innocent or vulnerable people is simply not acceptable, \" the mea culpa reads. ( miller came out in 2013. )",

The implosion did do its job of breaking the stadium's steel beams, just not enough of them. Adamo group, which was contracted to bring the stadium down, says about 10 % of the explosives didn't detonate because of a wiring issue. The beams support the upper steel band that kept the roof inflated — when there was an inflatable roof. ( the free-press reports it was done in by a winter storm a few years ago. ) the company hasn't yet identified the root cause of the wiring mishap; it's unclear whether suspected friday-night trespassers may have pulled the wires, perhaps accidentally. Adamo says the beams that remain intact will come down this week, either via detonation or with excavators. Hydraulic excavators are what will take down the remainder, with wdiv reporting seven workers will spend six months recycling 1,700 tons of structural steel and 1,800 tons of rebar at the ferrous processing plant. The full demo will take one year and cap off an effort by the city to have the silverdome come down so that the site can be redeveloped. It's been owned by triple investment group since 2009. Wdiv offers a history lesson: the silverdome has been home to the detroit lions, the detroit pistons, the detroit express ( soccer ), wrestlemania iii, and a 1977 led zeppelin concert, among other things.

Anti-trump republicans trying to keep him off the gop ticket have a plan b: reject his vice presidential pick if they consider the choice unacceptable, nbc reports.

The anti-trump gopers want to lower that number to three. A source from the \" free the delegates \" group tells buzzfeed that installing an alternative vp is seen as the \" arranged marriage \" option. \" it's the grassroots saying if you're going to do this, you're going to do it with our pick, \" the source says, describing the three-state threshold as \" high enough to weed out crazy people, while low enough to let a few states come to terms \" with a rival candidate. Another proposed change is this addition: \" the preference of any candidate seeking nomination for president of the united states shall have no bearing upon the submission of names for nomination for vice president of the united states nor the recording of votes for the same. \" with just a week until the convention begins, nbc reports the suggested changes will be debated this week by the rules committee.",
