This week, oates says jabez wasn't even allowed out of the car at the school drop-off point because his long hair, which was tied in a bun, still violated the dress code. She plans to raise the issue at a school board meeting next month. ( another dress code policy regarding hair has been criticized for targeting black girls. )",

According to the new york times, the seven children — four boys and three girls — were born 12 weeks premature via cesarean section. \" they're beautiful, \" frustaci said at the time. \" i just hope they live. \" one of frustaci's baby girls was stillborn; the other septuplets had jaundice, heart problems, and more.

Joseph says those payments continue and now add up to over $ 1.5 million. Regardless, frustaci continued with fertility treatments and gave birth to twins in 1990.

Weintraub was behind huge hits like karate kid and ocean's eleven, but producing was actually his second career, following major success as a music promoter, reports the guardian, which describes how he built \" a show business empire on a rolodex and chutzpah. \" weintraub, who started out as an nbc page after serving in the air force, founded his own management company in the ' 60s and ended up promoting tours for established superstars like elvis presley and frank sinatra, as well as boosting the careers of up-and-comers like john denver. Weintraub, who died of cardiac arrest, had his name on dozens of movies, though his firm's bankruptcy in 1990 after an attempt to build an independent studio was a major setback, the new york times reports. Among the many people offering heartfelt tributes is close friend george hw bush. \" jerry was an american original who earned his success by the sheer force of his instinct, drive, and larger-than-life personality, \" bush says, per the guardian. \" he had a passion for life, and throughout the ups and downs of his prolific career, it was clear just how much he loved show business. \" his final movie, a remake of tarzan directed by david yates, will be out next summer, reports the new york daily news.",

Bloomberg reports the credit goes largely to china, which was untainted by the emissions-related scandal as the affected diesel vehicles aren't really sold there; as such, vw deliveries to the country surged 12.2 % last year. Another feather in vw's cap: inroads in sweden, where a volvo wasn't no. 1 for the first time in half a century. The journal's take on what went wrong: market and models. While vw's biggest markets are europe and china, japan and the us drive a chunk of toyota's sales, and us growth was just 2.8 %.

Birther 2: electric cruzaloo was kicked off by donald trump this week, with the donald repeatedly wondering aloud if cruz's canadian birth could keep him from fulfilling the \" natural born citizen \" requirement for president, despite his mother being a us citizen at the time of his birth. Here are six articles to keep you up to date on this important story: the los angeles times gets to the bottom of the debate by looking at what \" natural born citizen \" actually means and why the founding fathers included it in the constitution. \" they were worried about a foreign duke arriving with a boatload of gold and bribing his way to take power, \" a yale law professor explains.

And while he thinks cruz is eligible to be president, he also isn't surprised trump is bringing it up. \" it was pretty clever on his part actually. \" that's a sentiment echoed by slate, which finds this week's statements by trump \" sort of brilliant \" and \" pitch perfect. \" \" it's that slight, slight chance that cruz's eligibility may be imperiled that trump is sinisterly and shrewdly playing to … trump hasn't put cruz in a corner just yet but has put him in, shall we say, a spot. \" meanwhile, dana milbank at the washington post is savoring a bit of schadenfreude. \" trump's questioning of cruz's status as a natural-born american and, therefore, his eligibility to be president is rough justice. Cruz, like trump, has stoked the fires of resentment and xenophobia, so it's entirely fitting that he gets burned. \" newsweek notes the cruz birther story has taken on further shades of the previous obama birther nonsense, with cruz's campaign producing his mother's birth certificate. There had been allegations that cruz's mother was secretly a canadian citizen at the time of his birth. Finally, cruz is getting questions about his eligibility out of the headlines by creating a brand new controversy himself. The huffington post quotes his inflammatory choice of words when discussing hillary clinton and benghazi: \" in my house, if my daughter catherine, the 5-year-old, says something she knows to be false, she gets a spanking. \"",

Then ancient humans drew it. Npr reports research published tuesday in nature communications solves a number of ancient mysteries in one go. The first mystery is the sudden appearance, about 11,000 years ago, of the modern european bison, its evolutionary history a blank. The second mystery is why the european bison appears to have some pieces of dna related to cows. To get to the bottom of this, researchers studied dna pulled from ancient bones and teeth, phys.org reports. That led them to the discovery of the higgs bison ( that's a science joke, folks ). The higgs bison was the result of the steppe bison and the aurochs mating. \" finding that a hybridization event led to a completely new species was a real surprise — as this isn't really meant to happen in mammals, \" the study's leader says in a statement. Further research shows the higgs bison traded off periods of dominance with the steppe bison throughout the late ice age and would become the ancestor of the modern european bison. The higgs bison also solves a mystery related to cave art, specifically why ancient people appeared to draw two different types of bison when the steppe bison was the only known species of the time. Cbc reports drawings of what's thought to be the steppe bison have long horns and big front legs, while drawings of what's thought to be the higgs bison have humps and shorter horns.

Assemblywoman pamela lampitt has proposed a bill that would ban pedestrians from using communication devices like cellphones while walking along roads or public sidewalks, unless they are hands-free, reports the guardian. \" distracted pedestrians, like distracted drivers, present a potential danger to themselves and drivers on the road, \" yet \" i see it every single day, \" lampitt tells the philadelphia inquirer. \" maybe they will think twice about it. \" critics say officials should instead try educating people about the dangers of distracted walking. Lampitt fears that alone won't be enough, though she says half the money raised from fines would go toward pedestrian safety education. She cites a national safety council report that found 11,101 injuries were caused by distracted walking incidents involving cellphones from 2000 to 2011. A governors highway safety association report released last year also partly blamed texting and walking for a 15 % jump in pedestrian fatalities from 2009 to 2013. Lampitt knows the measure will be a tough sell — similar bills have failed in arkansas, illinois, nevada, and new york — but \" if it builds awareness, that's ok, \" she says.

Walter liew, 56, and robert maegerle, 78, now face as many as 20 and 15 years behind bars, respectively, for handing over the secrets of what quartz describes as \" a chemical used to whiten the cream in oreo cookies \" ( along with plenty of other uses related to everything from paint to car exteriors ). That competitor, state-owned pangang group, had apparently had its offers to buy the formula from dupont turned down on a number of occasions; per businessweek, prosecutors say panang group is in the process of constructing a sizable plant to produce the pigment, which generates $ 17 billion in sales for dupont annually. Prosecutors argued that liew and his wife ( who goes on trial later this year ) launched a company in the 1990s with the specific intention of profiting off of china's desperate desire to manufacture the chemical, reports ap. According to testimony and court documents, china buys more titanium dioxide from the west than it itself makes, and its leaders had declared that duplicating — or getting its hands on — dupont's recipe was a national economic and scientific imperative. The couple recruited dupont scientists, including maegerle, who worked for dupont from 1956 to 1991 before joining the liews. Prosecutors said he provided the liews with detailed information about dupont's taiwan factory. The defendants had argued that china obtained the information from public sources, such as expired patents. ( how the liews got busted is pretty fascinating. )",

In addition to a better work-life balance, researchers saw employee stress levels fall 7 %, while overall life satisfaction rose 5 %, per the guardian. One of the researchers from auckland university of technology credits employees for coming up with what could be \" a revolutionary way to work, \" which also brought increases in stimulation, commitment, and a sense of empowerment. Given more control over their time at the office, employees \" worked out where they were wasting time and worked smarter, not harder, \" he tells the new york times. \" supervisors said staff were more creative, their attendance was better, they were on time, and they didn't leave early or take long breaks. \" staff \" went beyond my wildest dreams, \" adds barnes, who also saw electricity costs decrease with fewer employees at work at one time.

Recently, roberts handed out some surprising advice at a commencement ceremony at cardigan mountain school in new hampshire. The chief justice was charming but contrary, freely admitting that his advice would sound strange. Then he went on to wish graduates just enough angst to make them the sorts of decent humans who understand other people and their troubles. The message was aimed at children, including his own young son who was graduating from the private boys boarding institution for sixth to ninth graders. Yet the wisdom is worth considering at any age, providing a poignant reminder for adults of the upsides of inevitable suffering. Specifically, roberts said: i hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but i hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don't take friends for granted. Roberts also appeared to reveal something about his view of himself in the speech, perhaps accidentally. He came off as humble, seeming to attribute his undeniable professional success in"

Tillerson talked tough on russia in interviews sunday, calling for the country to end its support of syria's bashar al-assad or face the consequences, the new york times reports. He called moscow \" incompetent \" for failing to hold up its end of a deal to rid syria of chemical weapons, and accused russia of interfering in european — but not american — elections. He said, however, that there was no change to us \" military posture \" in syria, and the fight against isis will still come first. In other developments: tillerson's remarks to the media made it clear that the russian relationship with syria will be a main focus of talks, the washington post reports. \" i hope russia is thinking carefully about its continued alliance with bashar al-assad, because every time one of these horrific attacks occurs, it draws russia closer into some level of responsibility, \" he said on abc's this week. Before he travels to russia, tillerson will be in italy monday for a meeting of group of seven foreign ministers, who are hoping he will provide some clarity on the new us approach to syria. Reuters describes america's us allies as \" confused and frustrated \" by mixed messages, with nikki haley describing regime change as a priority and tillerson saying the fight against isis comes first. The italy talks will likely be dominated by efforts by the us, canada, france, germany, italy, japan, and the uk to find ways to persuade vladimir putin to drop assad, but that task may be \" as enormous as ever, \" notes the bbc. Russia doesn't seem ready to make deals: abc reports that the \" joint command of syrian allies, \" which includes iran as well as russia, issued a statement sunday saying the us had \" crossed red lines \" with its strike on a syrian airbase, and warning that any similar attacks will be met a response. \" america knows very well our ability and capabilities to respond well to them, \" and \" we will respond without taking into consideration any reaction and consequences, \" the statement said. Fox notes that the syria strike has won president trump plenty of praise from liberal pundits, who largely aren't calling him out for \" flip-flopping, \" though there have been notes of dissent from both liberal and conservative outlets, which may grow depending on what happens in the weeks and months ahead.",

After waging a spirited defense of obama's \" long-term \" policies in january, sullivan has the president's back again, saying obama could \" resolve the three-decade-long battle between taxes and spending initiated by reagan and intensified by the orgy of spending under george w. Bush \" — if, that is, the gop loses ground in november and agrees on a reasonable mix of tax increases and reduced spending. Click for the full article. Nicholas lemann, meanwhile, has a lengthy profile of mitt romney in the new yorker that portrays him as a unique figure in us political history — both deeply religious and well-schooled in america's finance-driven, 21st-century economy. In fact, romney's mormonism would make him the country's most religious president ever, while his career as a consultant could help him solve the nation's stubborn problems — if only he could overcome his inability to relate to crowds. \" the private sector is less forgiving \" than politics, romney tells lemann. \" in politics, politicians make mistakes all the time and blame their opposition, or borrow more money, or raise taxes to pay for their mistake. \" click for the full article.",

            "I. Church this summer, i spent most of an afternoon in salt lake city with douglas anderson, a friend of mitt romney's. Anderson lives in a housing development in the foothills of the mountains that rise to the east of the city. We met in his living room, which leads to a patio with a view across the great basin — a view that isn't so different from the one that the first mormon settlers in utah had as they crossed the mountains, except that what you see now is prosperous urban sprawl, not a desert. Anderson, a bald, amiable man in his early sixties, is a democrat, but, like romney, he is a mormon, with deep roots in utah; he is part of the business-school and management-consulting worlds; and his father always made it clear that holding a high political office would be the excellent culmination of a career. In belmont, massachusetts, where both men lived for years, anderson was the romney family's \"home teacher, \" assigned by the church to pay monthly visits to support the family and its religious life and to offer a little guidance. In 1989, anderson and his family moved to salt lake city. On the coffee table in the living room was a large, leather-bound copy of the book of mormon",

Ban said that, had chemical weapons been used, it would be a \" terrible crime. \" but the statement doesn't necessarily mean syria will avoid a us strike. The state department is now walking back kerry's comments, with a spokeswoman saying he \" was making a rhetorical argument about the impossibility and unlikelihood of assad turning over chemical weapons he has denied he used. \" and writing for the ap, vladimir isachenkov observes that moallem made no mention of timeline or specifics and notes that it remains to be seen whether his comments are truly \" a genuine goodwill gesture by syria or simply an attempt to buy time. \"",

About 15 % of americans suffer from at least mild symptoms. And while most chalk up their blahs to cold weather, christmas blues, or work stress, the prime culprit is thought to be diminishing daylight. The wall street journal runs down some remedies: light therapy: about 20 minutes of exposure to an intense light at the point when your body expects daylight ( but doesn't get it in the winter ) has proven effective. Check the center for environmental therapeutics for more information. Dawn stimulation: a variation of light therapy gradually turns the light level up shortly before you wake. Patients report waking with more energy. Negative air ions: oxygen molecules charged with extra electrons seem to have mood-lifting properties. Commercially available ventilators fill the room with such molecules. Exercise outdoors: the cheapest solution may be to expose yourself to as much light as possible with a walk in the morning or at lunchtime.",

For some people, it also brings a desire to stay in bed and wait for spring. Seasonal affective disorder, or sad, affects an estimated 6 % of americans, causing depression, lethargy, irritability and a desire to avoid social situations. It can also create an urge to overeat, particularly carbohydrates. As many as 15 % of people in the u.s. May have a milder version that includes only some of these symptoms. The incidence rises along with the distance from the equator: roughly 8 % of canadians, 10 % of britons and as many as 20 % of scandinavians suffer from sad this time of year. Light therapy, using beams many times more intense than normal light, is the most common treatment. But a host of new therapies — from simulating dawn in your bedroom and changing your thoughts through cognitive-behavioral therapy to taking mega doses of vitamin d — are having success in some patients. Despite decades of study, experts still aren't sure exactly what causes sad, which is officially recognized as a form of major depression that remits in spring and summer. The seasonal and geographic patterns provide strong clues that it's related to the diminishing daylight in the fall and winter. One theory suggests that the reduced light disrupts peoples ' circadian rhythms, the 24-hour biological clock that governs waking, sleeping and many other body functions. Another theory holds that the darkness wreaks havoc with neurotransmitters — brain chemicals that affect mood. Some experts believe the reduced sun exacerbates vitamin d deficiencies. It may also be that sad has several different causes. There are other mysteries, too. Why do sad symptoms tend to peak in january and february, even though days are lengthening by then? why does it hit most prominently between the ages of 18 and 30, and why are women three times as likely as men to be affected? the incidence of sad is also surprisingly low in iceland, where the homogenous population leads experts to surmise that genetic factors may also play a role.

        "summary": "The size of a migrant caravan marching north toward the us border is increasing in size even as president trump escalates his rhetoric. In a series of tweets monday, trump called the caravan a national emergency, blamed democrats for weak immigration laws, asserted that \" criminals and unknown middle easterners \" were among the migrants, and said the us would now start \" cutting off, or substantially reducing \" aid to guatemala, honduras, and el salvador for not stopping their citizens from joining the group. Details and developments: the caravan: estimates of its size range from 5,000 to 7,000, reports npr. The caravan began in honduras, gained size as it moved north, and now most of its members are camped in tapachula, mexico. What's next: a caravan leader, david lopez, says the group will likely remain in tapachula for a few days as members decide whether to continue the march to the us border, per the wall street journal. The newspaper reports that several hundred returned to honduras in buses, and another large group may try to seek asylum in mexico. Trump's assertion: the president offered no evidence to back up his claim that \" middle easterners \" were using the caravan as cover to sneak into the us. Reporters from the ap traveling with the group haven't seen any. The hill notes that trump made the claim shortly after a guest on fox &amp; friends suggested that isis fighters could be embedded in the group. The penalties: guatemala, honduras, and el salvador received a total of about $ 500 million from the us in 2017, and it wasn't immediately clear how much trump aims to cut, the ap notes. Congress isn't back until after the midterms, and it also wasn't clear whether trump planned to take unilateral action, per the hill. One mother's choice: cnn zeroes in on the journey of rosalin guillermo of guatemala and her three children. Though guillermo was once at the front of the caravan near the border with mexico, she decided their best chance was to climb down a bridge and get on a makeshift raft. Her goal is to reach the us. Illegal entry: many of those in the caravan make no attempt to hide their plans to enter the us illegally, writes kevin sieff in the washington post. \" it's the only way, \" says a 34-year-old trying to reach his wife and son in columbus, ohio.

        "summary": "The handmaid's tale isn't the only new tv series to touch a nerve. The netflix series 13 reasons why, exploring a teenage girl's decision to commit suicide, is clearly in that camp as well. One tangible bit of proof? it has become the most tweeted about show of 2017, per a report at variety. The series, based on a best-selling young-adult novel, includes graphic scenes of rape, violence, and yes, the central suicide. Here's a look at the controversy: a main criticism is that it glorifies suicide. \" the series clearly communicates that if people in your life hurt you and made you feel bad then taking your life is a tragic, but highly effective, way of returning the favor and making them feel horrible, \" writes jack vannoord in the chicago tribune. But others say it's forcing a taboo subject into the spotlight. At the globe and mail, andre pecard faults its handling of the topic but says it's too late to complain about that now. The show is out and being widely consumed by teens, which means parents must watch it, ideally with their kids. At quartz, amy wang thinks parents should be less worried about the depiction of a suicide and more about the clueless adults in the series, particularly the parents of the suicidal teen. \" tear away all the sensational teen angst and frivolous girls ' -bathroom drama of the show, and you arrive at its real horror: a deep, yawning chasm between children and adults, \" she writes. \" that, in the end, is what's most responsible for hannah baker's death. If parents are alarmed by the show, it's because they ought to be. \" new zealand created a whole new rating because of the show: rp18. It means that those under 18 should watch in the company of a parent or guardian, reports e! online. The show's creators insist it doesn't glamorize suicide. \" we portrayed it as very ugly and very damaging, \" says writer brian yorkey, per the ap. Co-producer and pop star selena gomez says she expected a backlash because \" it's not an easy subject to talk about. \" school districts around the us are sending emails to parents advising them about the show, reports the journal news. Example: \" while the show is compelling and dramatic, the concern many of us that work with children share is that it does not accurately model what we would want or hope individuals do if they are struggling or in crisis, \" reads",

Interim police chief brian manley said monday that evidence suggests that three package explosions that killed two people are related, the austin american-statesman reports. Manley said the bombs that killed 39-year-old anthony stephan house on march 2 and a 17-year-old boy on monday arrived on doorsteps in \" average-size \" delivery boxes and exploded when the boxes were picked up or opened. Another bomb in east austin on monday injured a 75-year-old woman. A woman in her 40s was seriously injured by the bomb that killed the teenager. Authorities say they haven't ruled out the possibility of the bombings being hate crimes. The washington post reports that the two people killed are relatives of prominent african american families in austin. House is the stepson of former pastor freddie dixon, who says he knows norman mason, grandfather of the teenager killed monday. Mason is a dentist who mentors african american athletes at the university of texas, austin. \" i don't know who they've been targeting, but for sure, they went and got one of my best friends ' grandson, \" dixon says. \" somebody knew the connection. \" the woman injured by the second bomb monday is hispanic and police aren't sure if there is a connection between her and the other victims. Sxsw organizers say they are \" heartbroken \" by the bombings and they are urging festival attendees to report anything suspicious, the ap reports.",

The wall street journal, for example, calls out the company for a \" rare strategic blunder \" in a prominent story that rounds up the criticism. ( a tumblr is documenting some of the map fails here. ) apple insists that the function will get better as more people use it, but the gist from the tech world is that the maps are way too buggy — and simply not as good as google's. \" it's a precarious position for apple, \" write nilay patel and adi robertson at the verge, because the maps function is the iphone's major new feature.

That's because, as tests following his resuscitation from cardiac arrest revealed, he has a rare genetic condition known as brugada syndrome, which impairs the electrical system in the heart that helps maintain a regular heartbeat, reports cnn. In this case, it appears that the chunk of food stimulated his vagus nerve to change ekg patterns. The finding compelled docs to report in their case study in the journal pediatrics that children who go into cardiac arrest after taking a large bite of food should be evaluated for brugada. Given the condition is inherited, the boy's doctors in istanbul were quick to test the whole family. While they're still waiting on results for the parents, his brother has tested positive as well. \" odds are good that one of the parents has this, \" one expert says. \" sometimes, you don't really see it until you do the challenge test. \" in the us, four out of 1,000 people have tested positive for the condition, reports usa today. For this boy, who has since had a cardioverter defibrillator implanted, the hot dog that almost killed him very well may be what also saved his and his brother's life.

        "summary": "Mitch mcconnell still hopes to get a revised health care plan to the cbo on friday so it can be assessed over the holiday break, and one compromise in the works would keep in place a tax on the wealthiest americans. Details on that and other key points, as mcconnell tries to appease moderates who think the bill is too aggressive and conservatives who think it's not aggressive enough: tax: obamacare imposed a 3.8 % tax on investment income for individuals who make $ 200,000 or couples who make $ 250,000. The first senate plan would have repealed the tax, but nbc news reports that it might well be back in the revised version. ( it's not a done deal, however. ) the tax would bring in an estimated $ 172 billion over the next decade. Opioid money: gop leaders have agreed to provide $ 45 billion to states hit hard by the opioid epidemic, reports the hill. That's up from $ 2 billion in the original draft, and could help bring aboard sens. Rob portman of ohio and shelley moore capito of west virginia. Hsas: while the above two options would appeal to centrists, the washington post reports that mcconnell might reach out to conservatives by offering bigger tax deductions for health savings accounts. Generally speaking, hsas are used by wealthier americans, and new york explains that conservatives favor a system in which \" people use hsas to pay for routine care, and then purchase cheap catastrophic-insurance policies for the really bad stuff. \" cruz idea: sen. Ted cruz is floating an amendment that would allow insurance carriers to sell plans that don't meet all the requirements of obamacare — on say, maternity benefits or mental health care — provided they sold at least one plan that did, reports the new york times. He says it would result in lower premiums. Bonus analogy: \" once in glacier national park i saw two porcupines making love, \" said republican pat roberts of kansas. \" i ' m assuming they produced smaller porcupines. They produced something. It has to be done carefully. That's what we're doing now. \" the ap fact-checks: \" he is correct, it's tricky, but unlike lawmakers, porcupines have their mission figured out. \"",

That's according to a oct. 17 report by the department of the interior's inspector general, which found the unnamed employee used a government-issued computer to visit some 9,000 adult video sites, including many associated with russian websites containing malware. That malware, linked to ransomware attacks and designed to steal data from infected devices, infiltrated the usgs network at the earth resources observation and science ( eros ) center in south dakota, reports techcrunch. Nextgov reports the employee no longer works at the agency. Their \" extensive history of visiting adult pornography websites \" clashed with rules prohibiting the use of government networks to view pornography, agreed upon \" several years prior to detection, \" the report notes. The employee also broke rules against connecting unauthorized devices to the computer. Videos were saved to a usb drive, and a personal android cellphone also infected with malware, per the bbc. Techcrunch reports there were no threats to national security as the eros center, a satellite imaging facility monitoring land surface, doesn't operate classified networks. Still, auditors recommend usgs enforce blacklists of banned websites and do more to stop employees from connecting personal devices to government computers.

        "summary": "Indonesian disaster officials are relieved that more did not die in yesterday's two big earthquakes, which did not trigger a tsunami. The five deaths are being blamed on heart attacks and shock, the bbc reports, and only a handful of people were hurt. After an earthquake in the same province, aceh, triggered a tsunami in 2004, 70,000 were killed. The difference? in 2004, one tectonic plate slipped underneath another, whereas yesterday the plates rubbed against each other along their sides, scientists explain, so far less water was displaced. One consequence of the quakes: 49 inmates managed to escaped from jail amid the post-quake confusion. As police search for them, most communities are returning to normal. Meanwhile, the slew of quakes continue: early today, another temblor shook baja california, though the 6.9 shaker did not trigger a tsunami warning, the los angeles times reports. The same region of mexico also felt a 6.2 quake just nine minutes earlier. Yesterday, mexico city and the oregon coast were both hit by earthquakes.",

            "Image caption damage to buildings from the quakes was much lighter than expected two big earthquakes that struck off the indonesian province of aceh on wednesday caused the deaths of five people - three from heart attacks and two from shock, disaster officials say. They have expressed relief over the low casualty figures; 70,000 people died in the 2004 tsunami in aceh. However the chaos caused by the 8.6 and 8.3 magnitude quakes enabled about 49 inmates to escape from prison. Scientists meanwhile have been explaining why there was no tsunami. They say the main difference was that in 2004, one tectonic plate slipped beneath another, displacing a huge volume of water. Wednesday's quakes in contrast resulted from the plates rubbing laterally against each other - their movements although violent were less likely to create huge waves. \" in this case the movement in the earthquakes was horizontal - and horizontal movements do not create bulges on the surface of the ocean which generate tsunamis, \" geophysics professor john mccloskey told the bbc. \" very quickly after the quakes were recorded we were able to say that it was unlikely there would be a tsunami. \" experts say that the authorities in indonesia and in other countries were not wrong to evacuate people - because the seismological information available at the time suggested there could have been a big tsunami. Regularly hit separately, officials say that prisoners in an aceh jail took advantage of the confusion following the quakes and tsunami warning to escape. Media caption geophysics prof john mccloskey explains why the earthquake impact was minimal they say that while most offenders in the 200-inmate jail came back to the prison soon after the tsunami warning, 49 remain on the run and are being pursued by police.

A thai restaurant in south beach is suing its former executive chef, known to fans as chef bee ( real name piyarat potha arreeratn ), claiming that when he was hired, he agreed to close his family-owned restaurant — but instead he quit in quite dramatic fashion and returned to that eatery, stealing, the lawsuit claims, recipes, concepts, employees, and publicity photos. Arreeratn, for his part, says ( through his lawyer ) that the lawsuit basically assumes thai cuisine \" was invented on south beach in the fall of 2012 \" when khong river house opened, and that the restaurant is attempting to subject him to \" a vulcan mind-wipe to obliterate 20 years of cooking experience. \" chef bee, the lawsuit from parent company 50 eggs restaurant company claims, begged for the top job at khong, and its promotional campaign was built around him. It met with much success upon opening, but shortly before the opening, chef bee allegedly disappeared and then, when found, was \" panicking \" and refused to go into the kitchen: \" he stated he would get sick and break out into hives if he had to cook, \" the lawsuit says, according to the miami herald. Executives ultimately reduced his duties to simply promotional ones, but last month, he quit and returned to family-owned restaurant oishi thai — and, the lawsuit claims, started featuring the meals and photos he'd stolen. It was all part of \" a premeditated plan \" to steal those ideas, the lawsuit says. The miami new times has more, and notes that the \" steamy \" suit \" reads like an epic novel. \"",

Kalamazoo county sheriff richard fuller says tiana carruthers, a 25-year-old mother, was with several children outside an apartment complex when alleged gunman jason dalton approached her, fox17 reports. She told the kids to run inside and was shot three times when he opened fire. \" you look at where bullets ended, looking where the victims were and looking where the suspect vehicle was, i truly believe her actions were very courageous and likely led to the saving of some children's lives, \" the sheriff says. Carruthers was hospitalized with gunshot wounds in the shoulder, hip, and leg. Dalton, an uber driver, went on to kill six people and critically injure another, police say. Carruthers ' grandmother, phoenix windwalker, tells the detroit free press that carruthers ' actions were heroic. \" the children were saved, \" windwalker says. \" her 7-year-old daughter saw her get shot, along with her niece and the three other children. She saved the children by doing what she did, which was really courageous for her and i ' m proud of her, but i feel so, so sorry for her. It's just not fair. \" she says her granddaughter has had two surgeries and has been told it could be as long as eight months before she can walk again. Police, who are still trying to uncover a motive for the shootings, say dalton sideswiped a car after leaving the scene and switched to another vehicle, reuters reports.

Not since bobby fischer nabbed the title in 1972 has a us-born player even made it to the final table of the world tournament, reports the guardian. Fabiano caruana, however, just secured his seat. After three weeks of play in berlin, the us grandmaster, ranked third in the world, rose above seven top players to win the candidates tournament on tuesday, meaning he ' ll face norway's magnus carlsen in london in november, reports fivethirtyeight. Caruana's victory looked shaky after a loss to russia's sergey karjakin, who beat him in the 2016 tournament and went on to lose to carlsen. But the 25-year-old rallied in a final, six-hour match to take home $ 118,000 in winnings. \" i am absolutely thrilled, \" the miami-born caruana says. He started playing chess at an after-school program at age 5 after his family moved to brooklyn. For a time the youngest grandmaster in us history, caruana went on to join the us chess team, which he rejoined in 2015 after a move to italy. He's played carlsen, champion since 2013, more than 50 times over the years. In 31 matches of roughly the same length as those to be played in london, he lost nine and won five. There were 17 draws. Based on those outcomes, chessgames.com predicts caruana's chance of stealing carlsen's title is about 30 %, per fivethirtyeight. Still, \" fabiano is the single most dangerous challenger that magnus could face, \" four-time us chess champion yasser seirawan tells cbs news. \" it will be a tough fight \" but \" i ' ll come well-prepared, \" caruana adds, per the guardian.

Vanessa marcotte — an account manager for google — had set out from her mother's house, which she was visiting for the weekend, around 1pm, authorities say. Her family reported her missing hours later and her body was found a half-mile away in a wooded area around 8pm. The case follows last week's murder of jogger karina vetrano in queens. Police tell fox 25 they are investigating whether marcotte was sexually assaulted, then set on fire as her hands, feet, and head appear to have been burned. \" we do not know if this is a random act, \" a worcester county da tells wcvb, calling the circumstances of her death \" horrific, \" per mass live. Police, seen scouring the wooded area near a two-lane road on monday afternoon, are asking the public's help in finding out what happened after marcotte departed, reports fox 59. However, a neighbor tells the boston globe that the wooded lots nearby provide good cover for someone to \" grab her and bring her right into the woods. \" a former boss describes marcotte, a boston university graduate, as \" bright, \" \" ambitious, \" \" caring, \" and \" just a delightful person. \" she was \" known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work, and love of boston sports, \" a google rep adds. \" we are deeply shocked and saddened. \" massachusetts police say there's no sign vetrano and marcotte's murders are linked.

            "In one of the biggest casting coups for the cw, ruby rose has been tapped to play batwoman. The character will make her first appearance as part of the cw's annual dc arrowverse crossover event in december. Rose also is set to play the role in the batwoman series the cw has in development for next season. While the project is still in the script stage, with a star of rose's caliber attached and dc universe architect greg berlanti behind it, it is likely to go to pilot and series. ( i hear the cw is not planning to use the crossover as a backdoor pilot for batwoman but instead film a full-length pilot as it did with flagship the flash. ) one of the draws for orange is the new black alumna rose to return to the small screen likely was the opportunity to break new ground. If the project goes to series, batwoman will become the first gay lead character — male or female — of a live-action superhero series. Batwoman already has been a trailblazer for lgbtq+ representation in comics. After a long hiatus, she was reintroduced to the dc comic universe in 2006 when she was established as a jewish lesbian, becoming the first-ever lesbian superhero title dc character. In the cw's batwoman, written by caroline dries based on the dc characters, armed with a passion for social justice and a flair for speaking her mind, kate kane ( rose ) soars onto the streets of gotham as batwoman, an out lesbian and highly trained street fighter primed to snuff out the failing city's criminal resurgence. But don't call her a hero yet. In a city desperate for a savior, kate must overcome her own demons before embracing the call to be gotham's symbol of hope. Rose, who came out as a lesbian at age 12, has identified herself as genderfluid. In 2015, she wrote, produced, and starred in the short film break free, a tribute to gender fluidity, which became a viral hit, garnering more than 25 million views on youtube.

            "In one of the biggest casting coups for the cw, ruby rose has been tapped to play batwoman. The character will make her first appearance as part of the cw's annual dc arrowverse crossover event in december. Rose also is set to play the role in the batwoman series the cw has in development for next season. While the project is still in the script stage, with a star of rose's caliber attached and dc universe architect greg berlanti behind it, it is likely to go to pilot and series. ( i hear the cw is not planning to use the crossover as a backdoor pilot for batwoman but instead film a full-length pilot as it did with flagship the flash. ) one of the draws for orange is the new black alumna rose to return to the small screen likely was the opportunity to break new ground. If the project goes to series, batwoman will become the first gay lead character — male or female — of a live-action superhero series. Batwoman already has been a trailblazer for lgbtq+ representation in comics. After a long hiatus, she was reintroduced to the dc comic universe in 2006 when she was established as a jewish lesbian, becoming the first-ever lesbian superhero title dc character. In the cw's batwoman, written by caroline dries based on the dc characters, armed with a passion for social justice and a flair for speaking her mind, kate kane ( rose ) soars onto the streets of gotham as batwoman, an out lesbian and highly trained street fighter primed to snuff out the failing city's criminal resurgence. But don't call her a hero yet. In a city desperate for a savior, kate must overcome her own demons before embracing the call to be gotham's symbol of hope. Rose, who came out as a lesbian at age 12, has identified herself as genderfluid. In 2015, she wrote, produced, and starred in the short film break free, a tribute to gender fluidity, which became a viral hit, garnering more than 25 million views on youtube. Rose was awarded with the stephen f. Kolzak award at the 2016 glaad media awards, which is presented to an lgbt media professional who has made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance.

        "summary": "A rule that would have offered consumers a powerful tool against financial institutions by allowing them to join together to sue saw its demise tuesday night at the hands of senate republicans. The new york times and wall street journal report that, by a vote of 51 to 50 ( with vice president pence as the tiebreaker ), overturned a consumer financial protection bureau initiative started under former president obama that would allow consumers to launch class-action lawsuits against banks and credit card companies instead of being pushed into private arbitration. \" tonight's vote is a giant setback for every consumer in this country, \" cfpb director richard cordray said in a statement, noting that big players like wells fargo and equifax can now basically do as they please without fear of major customer pushback. Cordray added: \" wall street won and ordinary people lost. \" the cfpb, which emerged after the housing crash, says the rule that was set to take effect in 2019 would have offered consumers recourse against predatory practices. The trump administration, however, has called the bureau \" an agency gone rogue \" and accused it of overregulation that hurts businesses and the economy. Critics of the cfpb rule, which would have barred financial institutions from being able to slip arbitration clauses into contracts with consumers that prohibit class-action suits, say arbitration is more efficient than duking issues out in court. The times notes this vote can be filed under \" win \" for republicans — a column that's been mostly empty in terms of major gop legislative initiatives passed under trump. Two republicans sided with dems in the vote: lindsey graham and john kennedy. The measure now heads to trump's desk; he's expected to give it the green light.",

The rule, five years in the making, would have dealt a serious blow to financial firms, potentially exposing them to a flood of costly lawsuits over questionable business practices.

Primal scream therapy, which janov claimed could \" cure \" everything from alcoholism and asthma to homosexuality, holds that all adult neurosis is based in repressed trauma caused by a patient's parents during childhood. To access those traumas, janov provided patients with dolls, rattles, teddy bears, playpens, and more. The titular scream, which janov described as \" like what you might hear from a person about to murdered, \" was a byproduct of the treatment. Janov is credited as capturing the zeitgeist with primal scream therapy. John lennon was a patient and said john lennon/plastic ono band resulted from janov's therapy. Vice reports james earl jones credited primal scream therapy with curing him of hemorrhoids and smoking. And tears for fears originally formed as a scheme to pay for the therapy, naming themselves and their songs after janov's teachings, according to forward. The pianist roger williams lumped janov in with galileo, socrates, freud, and darwin \" as one of history's five greatest men. \" janov himself called primal scream therapy \" the most important discovery of the 20th century, \" believing it could bring world peace. But while primal scream therapy is still performed at the primal institute and janov primal center, one decorated psychology professor calls it a \" discredited theory. \"",

Among new details: the iranian internet would include a search engine dubbed fakhr, or \" pride, \" and an email service called fajr, or \" dawn. \" official statistics suggest iran is among the top 20 internet-addicted countries, with more than 40 % of the country online. The world bank, however, suggests the figure is just 21 %. Still, cyberspace has been central to iranian life for years, with facebook and twitter driving election protests in 2009 and an internet-patrolling task force led by mahmoud ahmadinejad himself. Whether the government is capable of developing an alternate internet remains an open question, however.

But researchers at the san diego natural history museum say they've unearthed evidence that humans, or at least \" an unidentified species of homo, \" were here 130,000 years ago — a \" bold and fiercely disputed claim, \" per the new york times, based on mastodon bones and rock scratches found in southern california in 1992. The claim, published in the journal nature, is that the markings suggest the use of tools to extract marrow or process bone material to create more tools. Critics aren't holding back. \" extraordinary claims require unequivocal evidence, \" one skeptic says, while an archaeologist adds: \" i was astonished, not because it is so good but because it is so bad. \" others think such an early arrival is conceivable. For instance, the denisovans broke from neanderthals around 400,000 years ago and lived in siberia, while bison came to north america by way of the bering land bridge — which has disappeared and reappeared — 135,000 years ago. What everyone agrees on is that the mastodon bones, which npr reports were measured using sophisticated uranium-thorium dating tech, are 130,000 years old. If a human-like species cut them, it's \" an order of magnitude difference, \" one researcher says. \" wow. \" ( our family tree is still very much a puzzle. )",

The us study looked at 481 sexually active, straight women with an average age of 20 who weren't in a committed relationship, and asked why they faked it.

Others claim to have heard one, then the other, while some say they heard both words simultaneously, the new york times reports. The auditory illusion, which went viral on tuesday, was first posted by instagram user cloe feldman, and a poll on her page had about 51 % people in favor of yanny, though polls elsewhere have laurel narrowly in the lead, reports the atlantic. As with the contentious dress, many experts have been coming forward with their opinions on the laurel versus yanny debate. Professor david alais at the university of sydney's school of psychology tells the guardian that it's an example of a \" perceptually ambiguous stimulus. \" \" they can be seen in two ways, and often the mind flips back and forth between the two interpretations, \" he says. \" this happens because the brain can't decide on a definitive interpretation. \" other experts noted that the acoustic patterns in the clip seemed to be halfway between the two words, and people were more likely to hear a different word when the pitch, bass, and volume were adjusted.",

Voisine and armstrong contend their state convictions do not automatically qualify as misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence because the state-law provisions can be violated by conduct that is merely reckless, rather than intentional. Whole woman's health v. Hellerstedt ( argued march 2, 2016 ). This is a challenge to the constitutionality of two provisions of a texas law regulating abortion in that state. One provision requires doctors who perform abortions to have privileges to admit patients to a local hospital; the other requires abortion clinics to have facilities that are comparable to outpatient surgical centers. Texas contends that these new laws are constitutional because they were intended to protect women's health, while the challengers argue that the law was actually intended to close most clinics and therefore limit women's access to abortions. Mcdonnell v. United states ( argued april 27, 2016 ). Former virginia governor bob mcdonnell is challenging his convictions for violating federal laws that make it a felony to agree to take \"official action \" in exchange for money, campaign contributions, or anything else of value. He argues that merely referring someone to an independent decision maker – in his case, in an effort to help promote a virginia businessman's nutritional supplement – doesn't constitute the kind of \"official action",
            "Washington ( ap ) — the supreme court has struck down texas ' widely replicated regulation of abortion clinics in the court's biggest abortion case in nearly a quarter century. The justices voted 5-3 monday in favor of texas clinics that protested the regulations as a thinly veiled attempt to make it harder for women to get an abortion in the nation's second-most populous state. Justice stephen breyer's majority opinion for the court held that the regulations are medically unnecessary and unconstitutionally limit a woman's right to an abortion. Texas had argued that its 2013 law and subsequent regulations were needed to protect women's health. The rules required doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and forced clinics to meet hospital-like standards for outpatient surgery."

Hours before the fourth installment in the franchise premiered, twentieth century fox revealed the predator underwent a last-minute edit to remove a scene featuring a registered sex offender, 47-year-old former days of our lives and melrose place actor steven wilder striegel. The single scene portraying striegel as a jogger who repeatedly hits on olivia munn's biologist character was cut after munn learned of striegel's 2010 felony convictions for risk of injury to a child and enticing a minor by computer, for which he served six months in jail, reports the los angeles times. Munn alerted the studio on aug. 15 and striegel's scene was removed within 24 hours, fox said. Striegel's case was previously unknown to fox \" due to legal limitations that impede studios from running background checks on actors, \" says a studio statement. But it was known to director shane black, striegel's longtime friend. After learning more details, \" it has sadly become clear to me that i was misled by a friend i really wanted to believe was telling me the truth when he described the circumstances of his conviction, \" black says, per the ap, apologizing to those \" i've let down by having steve around them. \" tweeted munn, \" those who know about abuse and... Continue to put abusers in positions of power are complicit. \" per the times, striegel began an online relationship with a 14-year-old he described as a distant relative. An arrest affidavit noted he kissed the girl, touched her breast over clothing, and engaged in explicit discussions of sex.",

But in may, five weeks before the london woman's due date, laurel's pain got so bad that she was admitted to a hospital where scans revealed a massive tumor on her liver, reports the telegraph. Four days later their daughter, ruby, was delivered by caesarean, at which point laurel was rushed to another unit to biopsy her tumor. That's when the occupational therapist who worked in oncology learned she had terminal bowel cancer that, undetected, had spread to her liver. In spite of four rounds of chemotherapy, laurel's body eventually stopped responding to treatment and she was transferred to hospice. Her husband spent the first weeks of ruby's life \" running between neo-natal to be with ruby and the cancer ward to be with laurel, \" and says in her final days he was allowed to stay the night with laurel and could \" hear her crying out in pain. \" she died on july 26, 2015, when ruby was just 10 weeks old. Says dave: \" after her death i so wanted someone to blame, but the doctors did everything they could. Every symptom she had was so easily explained by her pregnancy. \" and while \" there are no words \" to describe losing the woman he met at a youth summer camp in 1990, he says he finds strength in their daughter.

But when the pain worsened five weeks before her due date, she was admitted to the royal free hospital where doctors discovered a huge lump on her liver. Four days later she gave birth to her premature daughter ruby by caesarean section. Tests went on to reveal that mrs cohen, an occupational therapist who worked with cancer patients at university college hospital in london, had terminal bowel cancer which had spread to her liver. In the following weeks, mrs cohen underwent four rounds of chemotherapy at the royal free, but was eventually transferred to the marie curie hospice in hampstead, north-west london. Now, just over a year on from her death on july 26 last year, mrs cohen's widower david, has launched a series of fundraising events in his wife's memory.
