But it's also taking a devastating toll on the landscape, according to a photographer who embedded with hunters for three weeks. \" it should be one of the most pristine places on earth, \" amos chapple tells the news organization, but the tusk hunters ' favored technique is changing that. First, they blast the hills using firefighting pumps that draw water from nearby rivers. \" once they see the end of a tusk, they ' ll just give it a little wiggle, and then blast it some more, give it another wiggle, and eventually it ' ll come out. It's like extracting a tooth. \" meanwhile, all that newly blasted silt runs back into the river. Don't expect such hunts to end, however, thanks to a booming international trade that is perfectly legal, reports the bbc. One particularly large stockpile from russia of more than a ton was seized in china earlier this year, but only because it was improperly declared. Critics say the tusks, of which some 10 million sets may still be frozen in arctic tundra, are often sold as elephant tusks, thereby driving demand for ivory and further endangering elephants. In fact, half the ivory sold in china is thought to be mammoth ivory, the bbc notes. Woolly mammoths were kind of like \" prehistoric giant hairy \" elephants that got bigger and hairier the further north they migrated, until eventually, around 10,500 years ago, they died out — possibly due to being over-hunted and, per the christian science monitor, \" terribly inbred. \" ( could geneticists bring them back to life? )",

Or, if you're extra-creative, a sea monster that somehow ended up on land ( double eek! ).

        "summary": "President trump's travel ban and immigration policies could cost the us billions in lost tourist dollars, bloomberg reports. The news came as the us is already smarting from a strong dollar that lowers exchange rates for visitors. The us can expect to see 4.3 million fewer foreign visitors this year, and a loss of the $ 7.4 billion they would have spent, says adam sacks of tourism economics. International tourists spent $ 250 billion in the us in 2016. Sacks ' prediction was based on data from forwardkeys.com that showed a 14 % drop in us bookings from western europe between jan. 28 and feb. 4 when compared with 2016. Mideast bookings plummeted 38 %. The company says it sent its findings to the white house on march 3, prior to the release of trump's revised travel ban. Although a federal court halted the original jan. 27 executive order, the travel industry has warned the action will scare away tourists. \" it's the president's 'america first ' rhetoric, the trade protectionism, the mexican wall, \" sacks tells bloomberg. New york, the country's top tourist destination for overseas visitors, is expecting a 2 % dip in total visitors, among them 300,000 fewer foreign travelers, costing the city about $ 900 million. Flight searches from the uk to miami, the second most-visited city for overseas travelers, were down 52 % last month compared to a year ago, per online booker kayak. La could lose 800,000 visitors, most of them from mexico, and $ 736 million in revenue, the city's tourism chief tells bloomberg. Business travel bookings are down $ 185 million since january, the independent reported last week.",

The archdiocese is seeking a one-year mortgage from jpmorgan chase on land across the street from st. Patrick's cathedral, where the lotte new york palace hotel now sits, according to documents filed in manhattan supreme court, per reuters. State law requires court approval before a church can mortgage its property. Archdiocese rep joe zwilling says \" the loan would be used to cover the settlement costs \" that have sprung out of the independent reconciliation and compensation program, which was set up last october, reports the new york daily news. The program seeks to compensate victims of clergy sex abuse who vow not to take their cases to court. In many cases, the statute of limitations has already expired; victims must identify themselves by age 23. A mediator says 144 people have filed claims so far — more claims are expected — and 64 settlement offers have been made, though she refused to say how much money victims were being awarded. Even so, an attorney representing one alleged victim doubts $ 100 million will be enough to settle all the claims. Zwilling appears to agree. He tells cbs new york that \" once we know later this year what the final number will be, we will be negotiating a longer-term loan to pay out the costs of the program. \"",

        "summary": "The remains of us soldiers who died in the korean war finally appear to be coming home — a \" modest diplomatic coup \" for president trump, reports reuters. At a ceremony friday at pyeongtaek's osan air base in south korea, a us military plane arrived from north korea's wonsan city, bearing 55 small cases that were carried by soldiers decked out in dress uniforms and white gloves to silver vans. The remains were taken to an unspecified location ahead of a formal repatriation ceremony wednesday. After that, the remains will head to hawaii to be processed by the us defense pow/mia accounting agency. \" it's [ a ] huge development for all of the war families, \" says the head of the dna unit for the armed forces medical examiner system, per time. \" it's something they have been looking forward to and needing for the last 26 years, if not the last 60 years. \" \" the remains of american servicemen will soon be leaving north korea and heading to the united states! \" trump tweeted late thursday. \" after so many years, this will be a great moment for so many families. Thank you to kim jong un. \" the repatriation of the remains comes after an agreement reached by trump and kim at june's summit. Time takes a closer look at what's involved in finding and bringing remains back to the us after decades overseas, including challenges like body decomposition and political tensions. The bbc also notes forensic testing is needed to determine if the remains really are those of us soldiers. Meanwhile, former new mexico gov. Bill richardson tells the washington post that he fears north korea could eventually \" milk \" this. \" they ' ll give a certain amount of remains for free right away... And then they ' ll start charging, \" he says.",

But while their interaction was intense enough to earn a spot in the late-night rounds, vp mike pence didn't escape notice — despite doing his best job to not be noticed. One comment likened his role to \" a ' weekend at bernies'type scenario \" in which he was propped up in the chair like the famous movie corpse.

Which led to meyers ' quip: \" i guess when schumer said'shutdown, ' pence took him literally. \" the daily show: trevor noah's take on a \" pretty weird mike pence, \" whom he called his \" favorite part of this awkward threesome, \" was that he was either daydreaming — about a handmaid's tale-like world, naturally, per the thought bubble the daily show attached to pence's head — or stoned: \" he just sat there motionless, like a guy whose edibles just kicked in. \" the late show: stephen colbert provided a voice-over for what he imagined was going on inside the vp's head, which, per colbert, included thinking about what he'd like for dinner ( \" boiled potatoes \" ) and his own future turn in the white house, which would lead to the \" michael pence presidential library and casino. \" \" i wonder if i sit real still if people will even notice i ' m here, \" \" pence \" pondered. \" i ' m a manila envelope taped to a beige wall.

            "Please enable javascript to watch this video kansas city, mo. - a string of strange burglaries has caused federal officials to begin an investigation in missouri. Earlier this week, police officials announced they are investigating the purchase of cell phones at walmart stores in columbia, jefferson city, lebanon and macon. According to kmiz, employees reported that 100 prepaid cell phones were purchased at two missouri walmarts over the weekend. On thursday, police in jefferson city said they had a similar report of an attempted purchase within the same time frame. \"right then and there, i knew there was not something adding up about this. It's not right, it doesn't make any sense, \" a witness said. \"who's going to order 50 phones for christmas? who does that? \" now, federal officials have been alerted after dozens of propane tanks were stolen from several stores in the area. Wdaf reports that 18 to 20 propane tanks were stolen from outside cages at a bp gas station in lee's summit at the end of november. That same night, a nearby cvs reported the same crime. Two weeks later, another cvs in independence was hit, and 28 tanks were stolen from that location. While many people in the community say they are concerned the cases might be connected to"

The defense advanced research projects agency today announced a $ 26 million effort to develop a brain implant that could treat things like ptsd, anxiety, and depression. \" at darpa, we think that we have to go well beyond what is currently available, \" a program manager tells npr. The goal is to build on the simple brain stimulation devices that are currently used to treat parkinson's disease. Teams at uc san francisco and massachusetts general hospital will lead the effort. Their goal is to discover which neural pathways are related to various disorders, then create an implant that can nudge the brain into using alternative circuits. \" we know that once you start putting stimulation into the brain, the brain will change in response, \" one ucsf neurosurgeon explains. The plan relies on \" neural plasticity, \" the idea that the brain's physiology can change over time — as opposed to the older theory that adult brains eventually \" finish \" developing.",

A woman read a string of meaningless numbers on north korean state radio for two minutes on june 24. It happened again last friday; this time for 14 minutes. Popular mechanics gives an example of what this sounded like: \" on page 459, question number 35, on page 913, question number 55, on page 134... \" and so forth. The woman on the radio says the numbers are \" review assignments in physics \" or \" practice assignments in mathematic lessons. \" but what they really sound like are the secret messages north korea used to send to its spies in south korea during the cold war. While some in south korea believe north korea is once again using the radio to pass missions along to its spies, experts aren't so sure. North korea stopped using this method in 2000 with the advent of the internet and newer, better methods of hiding messages. It would be odd for north korea to go back to an outdated system that south korea already knows about. Plus, broadcasting these kinds of messages immediately alerts everyone that you're doing something shady. \"if it really is espionage activity, it's pretty old school, \" writes matt novak at gizmodo. \" but i guess that's how north korea operates these days anyway. \" experts think it's possible the strange numbers are just north korea's attempt at psychological warfare.

That pattern is caused by gravitational waves ( \" ripples in the interweaving of space and time that sprawls through the universe, \" as the ap puts it ), which have been called the big bang's first tremors; they've never before been detected.

Dolezal, 37, who today stepped down as head of naacp's spokane chapter, sued howard university in 2002 for allegedly discriminating against her and denying her teaching posts, the smoking gun reports. Her suit \" claimed discrimination based on race, pregnancy, family responsibilities and gender, \" says a court of appeals opinion. In the suit, dolezal alleged that professor alfred smith, then chairman of the school's art department, denied her scholarship aid and blocked her path to obtaining two teaching positions. Dolezal also claimed that howard university was \" motivated by a discriminatory purpose to favor african-american students over \" her when it took down some of her artworks at a student exhibition in 2001. Her suit added that the school was \" permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, \" the court opinion says. But a judge dismissed the complaint in 2004, saying dolezal had provided no proof of discrimination, and the dc court of appeals agreed.

Dessert frequently offers even slimmer profit margins than other parts of your meal. \" dessert needs good ingredients to taste good, but you can't psychologically convince people to pay even $ 20 for dessert, \" says an economist. \" you can't really go cheap on it, but you really can't charge extra, either. \" what's more, people may stick around for an extra half hour if they have dessert, during which time they're shelling out on far less than they did during dinner; they're not, for instance, ordering drinks, which are key to a restaurant's profits. One other thing to note: while the restaurant might not benefit from your dessert order, you yourself might, especially if you're on a first date.

According to a new study, ordering something sweet can actually help that romantic connection. Scientists at purdue university conducted a series of studies, both of which had the same results. In one experiment, college-aged students were asked to evaluate either their current relationship or a hypothetical relationship with a made-up partner. Half of the participants were given sugary drinks; the other half received glasses of water. ( no one was given alcohol, but wouldn't that have added an interesting layer to the research? ) the second experiment was set-up similarly, but participants were given food instead of drinks, so either oreos or salt-and-vinegar chips. Both experiments showed that those who consumed the sweet treat were much more interested in their date and felt more positive about the budding relationship in general — but that only worked for the hypothetical relationships, no differences were seen with participants in current relationships. The paper, published last year, suggests there's a powerful link between sweet tastes and emotions associated with love, particularly when it comes to initial attraction.

Former rival marco rubio, meanwhile, is doing everything he can to make sure trump will eventually have to make that choice, trying to hold onto the 172 delegates he won to keep trump from scooping up the 1,237 delegates he needs to avoid a contested convention, nbc news reports. Rubio aide alex burgos told msnbc that his boss \" wants to give voters a chance to stop trump, \" and right now that effort involves working behind the scenes to get state parties in at least 21 states and territories to not release any of his delegates — bucking the usual trend of simply letting delegates support a different candidate. In at least one case so far, it appears rubio's strategy is working. In a letter to peter goldberg, chair of the alaska gop, and cc'd to rnc chairman reince priebus, rubio made his case for the five delegates he nabbed march 1 in alaska, noting those delegates \" remain bound to vote for me \" — and after conferring with rnc officials in dc, goldberg agreed, at least for the first ballot at the gop convention, cnn notes. \" senator rubio will have his five delegates at the national convention, \" he said, per ktva. A rubio source tells msnbc that the same missive was sent to 20 other states and territories. Goldberg says he's heard other states ' parties are also huddling over the rules ( each state determines what happens to delegates, not the rnc ), with \" most \" leaning toward rubio. As for trump reaching that magic 1,237, john kasich spoke to that on monday's the kelly file, per the washington times. \" he's not going to get to 1,237, \" kasich said. \" that's like saying what if a spaceman lands tonight? \" ( gawker points out rubio's reference to the \" untied states. \" )",

Hernandez was \" keenly watching and admiring this beautiful friendly child, \" a manhattan assistant da said, per nbc. Although etan's body was never found, he was one of the first faces of missing kids on a milk carton, and his disappearance led to new laws that set up a national hotline and other initiatives to help search for missing children.",

File - this march 17, 2014 file photo shows a cvs/pharmacy in dormont, pa. Cvs health reports quarterly financial results on tuesday, aug. 4, 2015. ( ap photo/gene j. Puskar, file ) ( associated press ) but the nation's second-largest drugstore chain also narrowed its full-year earnings outlook and issued a third-quarter forecast that fell short of wall street's expectations. Its stock fell 2.5 percent in trading tuesday. The woonsocket, rhode island, company said that revenue from its biggest business, its pharmacy benefits management segment, jumped 12 percent in the second quarter to more than $ 24 billion, spurred in part by specialty drugs. These complex medications treat certain forms of cancer and hepatitis c, among other conditions. They often represent treatment breakthroughs but can cost considerably more than other prescriptions. Use of these drugs is soaring, and health insurers, employers and other bill payers are relying more on companies like cvs health to help restrain this growth. Revenue from the company's retail drugstore segment inched up only 2 percent to $ 17.2 billion in part because sales from the front-end of its stores, or the area outside the pharmacy, plunged 7.8 percent, at established locations. Cvs health runs 7,870 drugstores",
            "Sales at cvs health are getting \" smoked. \" last september, cvs became the first major pharmacy chain in america to stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products in its stores. The drug store chain said it was the right thing to do -- even though it would hurt sales. Now cvs ( cvs ) is detailing just how much the tobacco ban is impacting the company. While prescription sales continue to rise, general merchandise sales tumbled nearly 8 % last quarter on a same-store basis. Cvs blamed the slump on the tobacco ban.

            "Pricey specialty drugs helped cvs health cope with tobacco withdrawal and top analyst expectations in the second quarter. File - this march 17, 2014 file photo shows a cvs/pharmacy in dormont, pa. Cvs health reports quarterly financial results on tuesday, aug. 4, 2015. ( ap photo/gene j. Puskar, file ) ( associated press ) but the nation's second-largest drugstore chain also narrowed its full-year earnings outlook and issued a third-quarter forecast that fell short of wall street's expectations. Its stock fell 2.5 percent in trading tuesday. The woonsocket, rhode island, company said that revenue from its biggest business, its pharmacy benefits management segment, jumped 12 percent in the second quarter to more than $ 24 billion, spurred in part by specialty drugs. These complex medications treat certain forms of cancer and hepatitis c, among other conditions. They often represent treatment breakthroughs but can cost considerably more than other prescriptions. Use of these drugs is soaring, and health insurers, employers and other bill payers are relying more on companies like cvs health to help restrain this growth. Revenue from the company's retail drugstore segment inched up only 2 percent to $ 17.2 billion in part because sales from the front-end of its stores, or the area outside the pharmacy, plunged 7.8 percent, at established locations. Cvs health runs 7,870 drugstores",
            "Sales at cvs health are getting \" smoked. \" last september, cvs became the first major pharmacy chain in america to stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products in its stores. The drug store chain said it was the right thing to do -- even though it would hurt sales. Now cvs ( cvs ) is detailing just how much the tobacco ban is impacting the company. While prescription sales continue to rise, general merchandise sales tumbled nearly 8 % last quarter on a same-store basis. Cvs blamed the slump on the tobacco ban. The company said front-store sales would have been flat compared with the year before if they didn't make the change. Conlumino analyst stephen ward believes that while the smoke ban was a \" sensible move \" for cvs's brand, it has come at a cost. \" it has most certainly affected sales both directly, and indirectly, through the reduction in impulse purchases that tobacco customers made, \" ward wrote in a report.

        "summary": "\" we're finally home &amp; getting ready for our first real bath, then it's cuddle time! \" it's the kind of facebook post you'd expect from a new mom. Except this one, made last night, is more significant than most. Eli thompson was born to alabama parents brandi mcglathery and troy thompson on march 4, and as the doctor placed the 6 pound, 8 ounce child on mcglathery's chest, she realized something was amiss: her child had no nose. If that sounds rare, it is, incredibly so — al.com reports the condition, which also includes the absence of nasal passages and sinus cavities, is known as complete congenital arhinia. It's thought to occur in one of 197 million births; there are only 37 known cases on the planet. No one had seen it coming: mcglathery even recalls discussing the cute appearance of her son's nose in a 3d ultrasound photo, which captures bone; he does have a small protrusion of bone there. A gofundme page set up for eli explains that he had to have a tracheotomy and feeding bag inserted into his stomach; as a 2008 study on a case of congenital arhinia explains, \" neonates are obligate nasal breathers, \" and the \" simultaneous sucking and breathing requirement \" can lead to respiratory distress. With the trach in place, mcglathery has since been able to breastfeed him. What lies ahead: at least 10 years of scans and checkups every few months, the construction of nasal passageways, and plastic surgery to have a nose built. The nose will come later. As the 2008 study notes, reconstruction should occur \" near adolescence because growth of the reconstructed nose is unpredictable if done earlier. \" mcglathery isn't rushing things: \" we think he's perfect the way he is. Until the day he wants to have a nose, we don't want to touch him. \" ( another incredible story: a baby born with half a heart. )",

            "The u.s. Centers for disease control and prevention is warning clinicians to be on the lookout for an emerging, infectious yeast called candida auris. Healthcare facility-associated outbreaks around the world have revealed that the invasive yeast is resistant to typical concentrations of the three major classes of available antifungal drugs.

The most common risk factors are having an indwelling venous catheter, urinary catheter, recent surgery, previous courses of antibiotics or antifungals and prolonged hospitalization. Death can occur 30-50 % of infected patients. One concern is that c. Auris infections can masquerade as other types of less-problematic yeast infections and require specialized detection methods that are not available at all hospitals.

The arizona daily star was last week given a photo of a jaguar pelt, and the six arizona game and fish department officials who reviewed it came to a grim conclusion: there is \" a very high correlation \" in spot patterns, which are unique to each jaguar, when comparing the image of the pelt with a photo of a male jaguar that roamed the huachuca mountains south of tucson. Last caught on camera in march 2017, the creature had been named yo ' oko. While the daily star notes seven male jaguars have been photographed in the us since 1996, live science reports only three have been sighted in the last three years, per the center for biological diversity. The jaguar is an endangered species both here and in mexico, and killing one is illegal under both countries ' laws. So who did the killing? a mexican rancher tells the daily star that he heard from a friend the animal was killed roughly six months ago just south of the us border after being trapped by someone hunting mountain lions. How the animal was killed after it was trapped is unknown. \" i think it is very likely that the jaguar was trapped incidental to an effort to kill a puma that had been taking calves, \" speculates a former us fish and wildlife service biologist.",

The culinary union, which is the largest labor union in las vegas, has voted to strike as early as june 1 if major resorts fail to agree on a new five-year contract. Their current contract is set to expire may 31, reports cnn. The union represents 50,000 bartenders, servers, cooks, and housekeepers at nearly three dozen resorts. Mgm resorts international and caesars entertainment operate more than half of the properties that would be affected by a strike, reports the las vegas sun. The union is asking for higher wages, worker protections against the growing reliance on technology at resorts, and stronger protections against sexual harassment. Hotel and food workers are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment, one union official told the washington post. They file three times more harassment complaints to the equal employment opportunity commission than employees in higher-paying fields, according to an analysis by the center for american progress. \"we want casinos to enforce zero tolerance of harassment by guests and high-rollers and vip clientele, \" says one union communications official. The last culinary union strike in las vegas occurred in 1984 when about 15,000 workers walked off their jobs. It lasted two months and cost an estimated $ 75 million in wages and benefits. The outcome of strike negotiations is of particular interest to las vegas-bound fans of the fledgling vegas golden knights.

As it turned out, officer tim james had been investigated at least 11 times by the jacksonville sheriff's office and would a month later be arrested on charges of beating a teen in handcuffs. To land family attorney john m. Phillips, it looked like officers knew they'd \" kept a bad officer on the force, \" per the florida times-union. But in what phillips says is an apparent attempt to hide that fact, he notes his request for public records about james ' work history was met with an outrageous $ 314,000 bill — one of as many as three to come — which surprised even a former jso public relations officer. \" i have never, ever seen a request of this magnitude, particularly this amount of money, \" the former officer tells action news jax. A rep for the florida first amendment foundation adds such an \" absurd \" fee only comes when people seek information police \" don't want you to have, \" but the sheriff's office denies that. Undersheriff pat ivey says phillips'request was for 10 years ' worth of information on all complaints against police officers and would require a review of thousands of pages taking up \" a room the size of a small bedroom. \" a rep says the sheriff's office also produced an estimate for two specific items in phillips'request, totaling $ 600 before redaction fees, but phillips says he never received it. \" we're fine paying for copies, \" phillips tells anj. \" but $ 314,000 is offensive. \"",

        "summary": "Jimmy kimmel and stephen colbert have weighed in on the controversy swirling around a white house video and arrived at the same conclusion: both say sarah huckabee sanders should be fired. The late-night hosts cited media reports accusing sanders of sharing a \" doctored \" video of cnn reporter jim acosta's encounter with a white house intern. Critics say the video, which originated at infowars, was manipulated to make the confrontation look worse than it was. However, the man who created it for infowars denies that and cites a technical explanation for the differences. Colbert: \" the fact that the white house press secretary is promoting this doctored video is reprehensible, and grounds for dismissal, or as they call it in the trump administration: thursday, \" he said, per mashable. See his video here. Kimmel: \" ok, not only did he not accost her, he said, ' pardon me, ma ' am, ' \" kimmel said, per the daily beast. \" that's where the hucka-b.s. Machine comes in. Sarah huckabee sanders tweeted a doctored video clip that they believe is from infowars, which is a website for the mentally unbalanced, in which they sped up jim acosta's hand movement to make it look more violent.... She should be fired for that. Sarah huckabee sanders should be fired and sent to live in a jo-ann's fabric store for all the rest of her days. \" see the video here. Possible explanation: the infowars editor who made the video insists to buzzfeed it wasn't doctored. But he acknowledged that he downloaded a gif, \" saved it again as an mt2 file, then converted it to an mp4. \" that process could have made it \" look a tiny bit different. \" buzzfeed's charlie warzel has a detailed look at the controversy. One key point: \" there's no evidence that the video was deliberately sped up — but the change in format, from a high-quality video to a low-quality gif, turns the question of whether it was'doctored ' into a semantic debate, \" he writes. The videos: watch the encounter in real time here. And see the video tweeted by sanders here. The wall street journal has a side-by-side comparison here.

Figures like that have been reported before, but the report also accuses the regime of holding children as young as 11 in adult detention centers, and subjecting them to torture — including beatings with metal cables, electrical shocks to the genitals, ripping out fingernails, and sexual violence, according to the new york times. Western-backed rebels, meanwhile, have summarily executed children, and are using children as soldiers. While there's no policy of recruiting young boys, there's no age verification procedure, and \" many boys stated that they felt it was their duty \" to fight.

The party \" needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people \" like flake if it is going to stop illegal immigration, trump tweeted sunday, hours after flake told cnn that he won't be able to bring himself to vote for trump — and that he thinks other republicans should also distance themselves from the candidate. Flake has become the gop's \" anti-trump standard bearer, \" the washington post reports, which notes that he doesn't need to worry about pro-trump arizona voters punishing him for it until 2018. In other coverage: politico looks at what clinton and trump are planning for september, a month that both campaigns believe will be make-or-break for trump, with the sept. 26 debate probably his best chance to shake things up. Rudy giuliani told cnn sunday that trump is softening his stance on mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. Trump \" would find it very, very difficult to throw out a family that has been here for 15 years and they have three children, two of whom are citizens. That is not the kind of america he wants, \" giuliani said. The new york times reports on a clinton problem big enough to cost her the election: a lack of support and enthusiasm among young black voters, many of whom would sooner stay home than cast a ballot for clinton or trump. \" he's a racist, and she is a liar, so really what's the difference in choosing both or choosing neither? \" a young black woman in ohio tells the paper. The los angeles times looks at a problem for trump: a lack of support, especially among women, in the suburbs and exurbs that are likely to be decisive in states like pennsylvania. The hill reports that the race is narrowing: in a morning consult poll released sunday, clinton has a 2-point lead over trump, 42 % to 40 %. She had a 7-point lead in the same poll three weeks ago. The ap reports that both candidates and their running mates will spend labor day in ohio, with clinton and tim kaine attending a parade and festival in cleveland, and trump joining mike pence for a discussion with union members before attending a fair in youngstown.",

More details: an official tells cnn that operation of the system on a former golf course in seongju is \" limited. \" officials tell afp that additional hardware is needed to make the system fully operational, a goal set for later this year. But even when fully operational, thaad won't be able to shoot down the kind of intermediate-range missiles north korea has been testing, cnn notes. It can, however, destroy short- and medium-range missiles in the final phase of flight. So who's footing the bill? president trump said he wanted seoul to fork over $ 1 billion, but seoul said the us agreed to pay last year; white house national security adviser hr mcmaster reaffirmed the latter recently. Mcmaster, however, says a \" renegotiation \" is possible to include \" appropriate burden-sharing, \" per the times. This headache could continue. The leader of south korea's main opposition party — who's called for an immediate suspension of thaad pending a review — appears to be the favorite in the may 9 presidential election. He's not the only south korean approaching thaad with caution. The ap reports many fear health issues from the radar or that thaad could become a target of north korea. There are also concerns about its effect on the economy. Per afp, south korean automaker hyundai has already seen its sales plummet in china, which initially condemned the deployment.

According to live science, the 38-year-old man went to the doctor last spring after losing up to 22 pounds over the course of three days. He was also experiencing stomach pain, weakness, and vomiting, reports a case study published this week in the new england journal of medicine. According to the morning post, doctors saw tapeworm eggs in his stool and noted that he had been seen by other doctors for stomach pain and chronic anemia over the prior two years. He was given medication and excreted the giant parasite a few hours later, according to the case study. The tapeworm turned out to be a taenia saginata — or beef tapeworm — which can be contracted by eating raw beef, something the man had been doing for years, the morning post reports. According to live science, the poor soul had likely been serving as a tapeworm condo for at least two years. Beef tapeworms can live in humans for years, causing little more than some nausea after meals, while growing to up to 33 feet. It was central china's first tapeworm case in three decades. Since excreting the tapeworm, the man has made a full recovery, the morning post reports. But his doctor, jian li, tells live science he's probably done eating raw beef. \" it was physically, emotionally, and financially exhausting for him, \" li says.

The company had been offering contract-free plans as an option alongside two-year contracts, cnet reports; now, according to the t-mobile website, contract plans are a thing of the past. An example of a new plan: for $ 50 a month, you get unlimited talk, texting, and web, plus 500mb of high-speed data. Unlimited high-speed data will run you $ 70 a month. But that's not the full picture: you've also got to pay for your phone without the subsidies normally associated with contract plans, which knock pricey phones ( new models can cost $ 600 to $ 700 ) way down ( typically to around $ 200 with a two-year contract ). Now, t-mobile will now charge an upfront fee ( $ 60 in the case of the $ 550 galaxy s3 ) and tack the remainder of the cost onto the monthly bill for two years ( in that case, $ 20 per month ). The fees stop once the phone's paid for, and at that point, you own the phone. The wall street journal observes that the move could prod customers to choose cheaper phones, as they do in europe, japan, and other unsubsidized markets. But it adds that it's a risky move for the fourth-place carrier, which has lost 4 million contract customers in the last two years.",

As phys.org reports, humans appear to be the rare mammals that can be either monogamous or polygamous — other species are typically one or the other. And now, university of oxford researchers say they've found that some humans ( 53 % of women and 43 % of men ) are more inclined to be faithful, while others ( 57 % of men and 47 % of women ) are more inclined to be promiscuous. \" this research suggests that there may be two distinct types of individuals within each sex, pursuing different mating strategies, \" the researchers say of their results, published in biology letters. To get these results, the team compared the results from a questionnaire of sexual habits to data on something called the \" 2d: 4d \" ratio. That ratio has to do with finger length: the longer your ring finger is when compared to your index finger, the higher the levels of testosterone you were likely exposed to in the womb; these higher levels have been linked to a higher chance of promiscuity. \" while not predictive of individual behavior, the length of the ring finger versus the index finger can help identify the group of people who are more likely to be promiscuous, \" a university of oxford press release explains. The researchers compared those results to the questionnaire data because, one explains, \" human behavior is influenced by many factors, such as the environment and life experience, and what happens in the womb might only have a modest effect on something as complex as sexual relationships. \" ( meanwhile, jealous men and women focus on very different things. )",

Unlike other species, which are inclined to be either promiscuous or faithful, both mating strategies seem to be used by humans. The results, published in the journal biology letters, are from a study jointly carried out by professor robin dunbar's lab at the oxford university and professor john manning at northumbria university. Previous physical comparisons between humans and other mammals suggest that humans are mid-way between being a faithful species and a promiscuous species. Research by dr rafael wlodarski and professor dunbar at oxford university's department of experimental psychology suggests that this may actually be because humans consist of a mix of people, some of who are interested in short-term flings while others would like to form long-term commitments. The researchers analysed previously collected answers from nearly 600 north american and british people on a standardized questionnaire about social and sexual attitudes. They also looked at measurements of the right index ( second ) finger versus the ring ( fourth ) finger from 1,313 british people. The shorter the index finger in relation to the ring finger ( the 2d: 4d ratio ), the higher the levels of testosterone that person is likely to have been exposed to while developing in the womb. This is true for both men and women. From previous work, the researchers already knew that the higher levels of foetal testosterone can go together with greater sexual promiscuity as an adult. While not predictive of individual behaviour, the length of the ring finger versus the index finger can help identify the group of people who are more likely to be promiscuous. The statistical analysis of sexual attitudes data found that people's answers tended to clump into two groups, with one group corresponding to those who were more likely to value sexual fidelity, and the other group more likely to be promiscuous.

The statistical analysis of sexual attitudes data found that people's answers tended to clump into two groups, with one group corresponding to those who were more likely to value sexual fidelity, and the other group more likely to be promiscuous. This was true for both men and women"

Chief new york times book critic michiko kakutani has taken a voluntary buyout and will step down from her post — a move that \" will instantly change the shape of the publishing world, \" reports vanity fair. After joining the times in 1979 as a reporter, kakutani became a book critic in 1983 and helped make the careers of authors including david foster wallace, whom in 1996 she called \" one of the big talents of his generation, \" per the times. Getting a good review from kakutani \" was like having the good fairy touch you on the shoulder with her wand, \" author mary karr tells npr. But her words could as easily tear authors down. Nicholson baker says kakutani's reviews of his books were usually bad, and reading each one was \" like having my liver taken out without anesthesia. \" another of kakutani's victims was bill clinton, whose 2004 memoir my life she found \" sloppy, self-indulgent and often eye-crossingly dull. \" such reviews earned her the title of \" the most feared woman in publishing, \" per vanity fair. Still, \" no one has played a larger role in guiding readers through the country's literary life over the past four decades, \" times executive editor dean baquet writes in a memo to employees. In a tweet, kakutani — who won the pulitzer prize for her writing in 1998 — says she is \" moving on to focus on longer pieces about politics &amp; culture, though i will always love &amp; write about books. \"",

As the telegraph recounts, the story goes like this: a man and his girlfriend got back from a trip to thailand and couldn't figure out what happened to the woman's watch. Then they started looking at photos from the trip, and one shows a young thai girl in ceremonial garb who appears to be fiddling with the watch at the precise moment the photo was taken. \" this pic solved the mystery of the missing watch, \" writes the unidentified poster, who thinks he snapped an image of a pickpocket in action. The post generated so much attention that police in thailand brought in the two pictured girls for questioning with their parents, and the parents adamantly deny the allegation, notes a post at khaosod english. \"the parents of the kids are very concerned and said they would have filed a complaint against the false accusation were the ( foreign couple ) still here in thailand, \" says a police official. The mother says her girls pose for tourists and never beg for money, and finds it incredulous that people think her daughter, 7, could steal a watch unnoticed. But reddit commenters had an answer for that. \" notice how the thief is touching her hand in several places? \" writes one. \" it's a pickpocket technique so that the mark gets accustomed to being touched by the thief and stops registering all of the touches. \" for the record, the photo was snapped on steps leading to a temple called wat phra that doi suthep in chiang mai province, notes the sun. The man who posted the photo said it was a cheap watch and not a big deal. \" we were a bit drunk, and those girls are absolute pros. \" ( watch your valuables at the eiffel tower, too. )",

        "summary": "\" i can't breathe, \" protesters chanted in new york after a grand jury yesterday decided not to indict nypd officer daniel pantaleo in the chokehold death of eric garner. The new york times has details from pantaleo's nov. 21 grand jury testimony as described by his lawyer, stuart london. London says the 29-year-old testified that he wasn't trying to use a chokehold, but rather a wrestling-style move he learned at the police academy: the intention was to hook one arm under garner's arm, encircle garner's torso with the other, and cause garner to lose his balance and fall. Except pantaleo says he got scared as the two struggled, and one arm shifted to garner's neck. After the two went down, pantaleo says he didn't yet move his arm because he was trying to get his own balance back and wanted to keep garner from potentially biting arriving officers. London says pantaleo did hear garner say he couldn't breathe, and \" that's why he attempted to get off as quick as he could. \" but the times points out that video from the scene shows \" officer pantaleo holding firm and not appearing to hurry to get off mr. Garner. \" more: one lawyer speculates to the times that the grand jury's decision was likely influenced by the autopsy report, which included obesity, a weak heart, and asthma as contributing factors along with the chokehold and chest compression: \" there were so many causes of death in the autopsy report. \" thousands of protesters gathered at several locations in the city last night, including times square, for protests that remained largely peaceful, cnn reports. Demonstrators briefly blocked the west side highway, the lincoln tunnel, and the brooklyn bridge. Protesters chanting \" no justice, no tree \" gathered close to the christmas tree lighting ceremony at rockefeller center, although police wouldn't let them get close to the tree, cbs2 reports. Police say at least 17 people were cited for obstruction of vehicular traffic. Garner's widow — whose first reaction to the grand jury decision was disbelief — says she will not accept the officer's apology, the new york daily news reports. \" hell, no! \" she said last night when asked if she would accept his condolences. \" the time for remorse was when my husband was yelling to breathe. \"",

At issue was the fact that as more pharmaceutical manufacturers are refusing to be party to capital punishment, states are turning to compounding pharmacies, which nbc news reports aren't regulated by the fda.

Smull was scheduled to die nearly 24 hours earlier, but the u.s. Supreme court issued a stay while the full court weighed two petitions filed by defense lawyers. The high court later denied the petitions and removed the stay -- and then vacated a stay issued by a lower court -- and last-minute motions by the defense could not stop the execution.

In an interview with megyn kelly on fox news, they talk about how they felt and what they did when they discovered their oldest son had \" improperly touched \" four of his sisters and a babysitter. Some highlights: \" as parents, we felt, we're failures, \" michelle duggar said. \" here we've tried to raise our kids to do what's right, to know what's right, and yet one of our children made some really bad choices. I think as a parent, we were just, we were devastated. \" but this \" was not rape or anything like that, \" jim bob said. \" it was touching someone over the clothes. It was, like, a few seconds, and then he came to us and crying told us what happened. \" the abuse continued even after josh first confessed the abuse in 2002, and they had to put up \" safeguards \" at home, the duggars admitted. Jim bob said josh was eventually \" pulled from the home \" for a christian counseling program. \" it was after that third time he came to us, is where we really felt like, ' you know what? we have done everything we can as parents to handle this in-house, ' \" jim bob said. \" ' we need to get help. ' \" the couple said they aren't sure whether 19 kids and counting will continue, but jim bob defended the decision for the family to star in a reality show despite their shocking secret. \" we had a clean bill of health from the state. We had no fear, \" he said. The record was sealed, he added, and \" they said it would never be brought out. \" the duggars describe the document leak that exposed the scandal as an \" unprecedented attack \" on their family and believe they're being targeted because of their religion. \" every one of us has done things wrong. That's why jesus came, \" michelle says. \" there's an agenda, and there's people that are purposing to try to bring things out and twisting them to hurt and slander. \" kelly also spoke to two duggar daughters, and she says the rest of the interview will be aired on friday night, usa today reports.

        "summary": "Before his death in 1980, dr. Hans asperger said he kept his adolescent patients safe from the nazis, a claim repeated years later by autism experts. The pediatrician — for whom asperger's syndrome was named in 1981 — even went so far as to say he'd become a target of the nazis himself for those actions, reports the bbc. All that has been upended by a study of his personnel files and patient records, published thursday in molecular autism. Medical historian herwig czech writes that asperger not only \" publicly legitimized race hygiene policies \" and signed his diagnostic reports with \" heil hitler, \" per the local, but also sent several children to the am spiegelgrund euthanasia clinic, where the guardian reports 789 children were killed between 1940 and 1945. Czech says \" there is no evidence to show his contributions to autism research were tainted \" or that he deliberately earmarked kids for euthanasia. But he found that asperger in 1939 wrote it was necessary to \" carry out restrictive measures \" to stop \" the diseased... From transmitting their diseased hereditary material. \" in one case, asperger ordered a 2-year-old with acute inflammation of the brain be sent to spiegelgrund on the basis that \" she must be an unbearable burden to her mother. \" the girl died there three months later. Czech argues asperger was \" rewarded for his affirmations of loyalty [ to the nazis ] with career opportunities \" and concludes that \" the narrative of asperger as a principled opponent of national socialism and a courageous defender of his patients...

        "summary": "Modern-day sea otters would prove no match for their 6-million-year-old, wolf-sized ancestors, who didn't need rocks to smash open mollusks. They could do that, and perhaps rip into tougher and larger prey, with a single bite from surprisingly powerful jaws, according to new research. In the latest study of siamogale melilutra, described earlier this year as the largest otter ever found, researchers created a computerized model of the 110-pound animal's biting power. Turns out, it \" had a jaw that was six times as strong as expected, based on what we see in living species, \" researcher jack tseng of the university at buffalo tells the bbc. This, along with the animal's size, \" implies that siamogale was capable of crushing much larger and harder prey than observed in any of the living otter species, \" researchers write in scientific reports. Indeed, \" its giant size and high mandibular strength confer shell-crushing capability matched only by other extinct molluscivores such as the marine bear kolponomos. \" tseng says siagmogale likely dined on crabs and mollusks just like present day sea otters. But it's also possible that the animal crushed the bones of turtles, birds, and small mammals as a top predator in its ancient habitat in what is now southwestern china, per new atlas. So why are the jaws of today's otters relatively weak in comparison? one theory is that as the animals became more adept at using \" tools \" to gather their food, the need for uber-powerful jaws became less pressing.

Therefore, our hypotheses of similarity between siamogale and living durophagous otters, as well as predicted differences between living durophagous and non-durophagous otter species, are not supported by the data. In fact, the relationship between the unadjusted se values and model volumes of living otter species is significantly linear ( fig. 3c, table 3 ). This stiffness-volume linearity is a relationship expected from isometric scaling of a given finite element model with input forces set proportional to surface area5. In dumont et al.'s derivation of proper scaling coefficients for maintaining proportional output values ( i.e., isometric model scaling ), a linear relationship is expected between strain energy and model volume given that input force to area ratio is held constant.

Several others — carnegie mellon university, notre dame, johns hopkins university, and cosby's alma mater, temple university — followed suit after that conviction for sexually assaulting a temple employee, reports npr. Yale's move, however, might sting even more. Cosby, who received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from yale for his \" contributions to society \" in 2003, on tuesday became the first person in the university's 317-year history to have an honorary degree revoked, reports the atlantic, which notes yale has handed out more than 2,500 honorary degrees. The move, sought by students since 2014, was cemented with a vote by yale's board of trustees and \" a court record providing clear and convincing evidence of conduct that violates fundamental standards of decency shared by all members of the yale community, conduct that was unknown to the board at the time the degree was awarded, \" a university rep says.

He says the idea that he was potentially trying on a killer's glove is \" kind of an eerie thought. \" sharpiro's interview with kelly is the first time he's given new details on the simpson trial in two decades. In it, he reveals what simpson whispered to him immediately after he was acquitted: \" you told me this would be the result from the beginning. You were right. \" he also casts doubt on simpson's moral innocence. \" if you look at it from a moral point of view a lot of people would say, ' he absolutely did it, ' \" people quotes shapiro as saying during the interview. He says making sure innocent people aren't convicted sometimes means guilty people go free. But in terms of simpson's legal innocence, shapiro says he's absolutely certain. \" there's no question in my mind that any fair juror who saw that case from the beginning to the end would conclude there was reasonable doubt. \"",

The 12th-century umayyad mosque ( great mosque of damascus ) is one of the structures in that city that has been damaged, losing its famed minaret in april 2013. Examining commercially available images of 18 different areas, unitar discovered that 189 sites were moderately or severely damaged, while another 24 have been destroyed altogether; another 77 have been \" possibly destroyed \" ( meaning debris is visible ). The damage has been caused by fighting between rebels and bashar al-assad's forces, as well as by sunni muslim militants who believe some of the sites are \" heretical, \" reuters notes. The images are an \" alarming testimony of the ongoing damage that is happening to syria's vast cultural heritage, \" the report states. \" national and international efforts for the protection of these areas need to be scaled up in order to save as much as possible of this important heritage to human-kind. \" a dedicated website has been set up that shows which sites have been damaged.

        "summary": "A sailor who photographed classified areas inside a nuclear sub finds it deeply unfair that he's probably on his way to prison while hillary clinton might be on her way to the white house. Petty officer 1st class kristian saucier, 29, pleaded guilty in may this year to retaining national defense information without permission in 2009, politico reports. He could get up to 78 months in prison when he's sentenced on friday, but in a court filing, his lawyer argues that probation would be more appropriate because he possessed just six classified photos from the uss alexandria — and hillary clinton wasn't punished for having 110 emails on her private server that contained information considered classified. \" it will be unjust and unfair for mr. Saucier to receive any sentence other than probation for a crime those more powerful than him will likely avoid, \" attorney derrick hogan says in the filing, noting that saucier didn't pass the photos to any unauthorized recipient, but took them out of a \" misguided desire \" to someday show his children what he did in the navy. The hill notes that the citing of the clinton case will give ammunition to critics who say not indicting clinton set a \" dangerous precedent. \" hogan, however, also cites the cases of two other sailors on the alexandria who were found to have taken photos in classified areas. One was docked $ 560 in pay and bumped down a rank, while the other was docked $ 560 without having his rank reduced.",

        "summary": "There's a new enemy in the battle against global warming: reservoirs. Researchers studying more than 250 of the world's reservoirs found they produce the equivalent of 1 gigaton of carbon dioxide every year, the washington post reports. According to popular science, that's about the same amount of greenhouse gas as brazil produces annually and includes 25 % more methane than previously believed. About 79 % of the greenhouse gases emitted by reservoirs is methane ( the rest is carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide ). That's not great news as methane is about 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to exacerbating global warming, phys.org reports. Reservoirs produce more greenhouse gases than natural bodies of water because they include more organic matter in the water — the grasses and trees that were flooded, runoff from nearby farms — for microorganisms to break down. Unfortunately, more and more reservoirs are being built, especially in developing countries and as a way to meet climate change goals, the christian science monitor reports. So it now appears hydropower, which uses reservoirs, may not be as green as previously believed. Researchers say it's time the world starts paying attention to reservoirs. They produce about as much methane as rice paddies and biomass burning but aren't included in international emissions estimates like those other two. ( california is going after its farting cows. )",

But mr ryan declined to lay out the costs of the rate cut and the offsetting revenue",
            "Fox news ' chris wallace pressed gop vice presidential candidate paul ryan on sunday morning to try to explain how mitt romney's tax plan would add up. The conundrum is that romney is proposing to lower all individual rates by 20 percent by targeting deductions for high-income earners, without putting the burden on the middle class or adding to the deficit — a plan the tax policy center has shown to be \" mathematically impossible. \" wallace tried to get ryan to explain how the tax plan achieved all of these goals and pointed out that the plan was \" not revenue neutral unless you take away the deductions, \" but the wisconsin republican deflected the question: ryan: we're saying, limited deductions so you can lower tax rates for everybody. Start with people at the higher end... Lowering tax rates by broadening the tax base works. Wallace: you haven't given me the math. Ryan: ( laughs ) well, i don't have the time. It would take me too long to go through all the math. But let me say it this way, you can lower tax rates by 20 percent across the board by closing loopholes and still have preferences for the middle class for things like charitable deductions, for home purchases, for health care...
