            "Enjoying legal protection to dress in pirate regalia at work let me share this article written by daniel dowdy for the rutgers journal of law and religion about employment protections for pastafarians in the workplace. For all of us who want to take off every friday from work without fear of reprisal ( religious discrimination ) this is important. Mr dowdy goes into detail about the history of the church and what if any allowances can reasonably be asked of employers, citing decades of law. It's an incredible piece of work and written in an approachable and entertaining way. I was blown away. I ' ll paste some excerpts of the article below, but please take the time to read the article if you have any interest in this stuff – you won't be disappointed. Here's the link to the rutgers journal article. And here's some excerpts: your newly hired employee, toni, has just walked into your office on her first day at meerkat manufacturing, the private corporation where you serve as a mid-level manager. She is donning a weathered vest with eighteen buttons, a flowing woolen coat over the top that has oversized cuffs ( though it's mid-july ), striped pants that bag and tuck into high black socks just above her knees. On her head is a large metal colander, the same kind you have under your sink at home. She's come to request fridays off. Every friday. Toni says that as a \"pastafarian \" she is entitled to have every friday off as a religious holiday. … title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee or prospective employee on the basis of religion, among other protected classes. …",

        "summary": "A wall street analyst in the bronx who spent much of his time attending mundane meetings, filing reports, and networking ( including on linkedin ) turned out to be a russian spy — just part and parcel of the undercover espionage operations that burrow into place in new york city, as reported in a fascinating read on bloomberg. The article tells the tale of evgeny buryakov, a banker who infiltrated corporate and governmental circles to try to cull secrets, but it's also the story of how these operatives pull off their long con. And long it is: russian intelligence spies exhibit \" extreme patience \" by befriending junior-level workers, exchanging and drawing out meaningless info, and then nurturing those relationships for years, until one day that junior person reaches senior ranks and willingly offers up valuable info to their \" old friends. \" \" this isn't about just stealing classified information. This is about stealing you, \" maria ricci, a longtime fbi agent, tells bloomberg. What's most intriguing is these operatives'reliance on human recruitment over more readily available \" open source \" info — \" whispered conversations always feel sexier, \" ricci notes — as well as some of the surprising missteps the profiled spies made. The article even gets into the sometimes comical disappointment of undercover russian operatives who, while well aware they're not the next james bond, still pine for a little more \" drama, \" even if it's something as small as getting to travel under an alias. As for buryakov, he was eventually arrested on charges of \" conspiring to act in the united states as an agent of the russian federation \" and sentenced in may to 30 months in prison. ( read the bloomberg article to see how the fbi set up buryakov in its \" final dramatic episode … of a foreign spy recruiting a wall street source, from first contact to document handoff. \" )",

On the morning of jan. 26, 2015, his modest brick home in the bronx was getting the first inches of what would be almost a foot of powder, and buryakov, the no. 2 executive at the new york branch of a russian bank, decided to skip work and head around the corner to a grocery store to buy supplies for his family of four. As the 39-year-old russian bundled into his winter gear and closed the front door of his house behind him, he didn't realize he would never set foot in it again. Since the buryakovs ' arrival in new york in august 2010, they had seemed like any other immigrant family in the melting-pot bronx neighborhood of riverdale. Of average height and build, evgeny's only curious feature might have been his near-obsessive taste for mcdonald's. The kids in nice weather played in the sandbox out back, next to the clothesline where their mother, marina, liked to hang their laundry. While evgeny commuted to the 29th floor of a manhattan high rise, she shuttled the children to a nearby parochial school and to afternoon activities like karate. The two nuns who lived next door watched the family parrot while the buryakovs went on ski vacations. But evgeny was leading a double life. His real"

According to his plan, a boombox would start blaring in the empty apartment at midnight. When neighbors or police knocked on his door, that would jostle a fishing line and set things in motion, as the denver post explains: \" the line would topple the thermos full of glycerin, and the glycerin would mix in the frying pan with the potassium permanganate to create a flame. The flame would set the petroleum-soaked carpet on fire. The fire would light the fuses. The fuses would detonate the jars filled with homemade thermite, smokeless powder and stove-top napalm mixed with bullets. \" what's more, holmes had a second system in place to cause even more destruction, apparently hoping to lure police resources from the theater. \" the whole apartment would have either exploded or caught fire, \" said the fbi agent. The only reason it didn't is because holmes ' neighbors didn't make a fuss about the loud music. Also today: the court heard a 911 call from a sobbing 13-year-old, cousin of the youngest person killed, veronica moser-sullivan. A dispatcher tried to tell the teen how to perform cpr, but the girl couldn't hear over the noise in the theater. A police detective said that after authorities put paper bags over holmes ' hands to preserve evidence, he started playing with them as if they were sock puppets, reports ap. He also tried to jam a staple into an electrical outlet. An officer on the scene said holmes seemed \" very, very relaxed. \" when the officer asked whether holmes had help with the massacre, \" he just looked at me and smiled... Like a smirk. \"",

Hardest hit were night owls, with many unable to perform at all during daytime hours. \" because owls are later and classes tend to be earlier, this mismatch hits owls the hardest, \" says smarr, \" but we see larks and finches taking later classes and also suffering from the mismatch. \" the solution? rather than telling students to sleep earlier, smarr suggests structuring classes around times when \" a given student will be most capable of learning. \" or students could structure class days to \" resemble non-class days, \" says co-author aaron schirmer, per a press release.

That draws eyes to the mayak nuclear facility, where spent nuclear fuel is reprocessed 20 miles from argayash. France's institute for radioprotection and nuclear safety previously suggested the radioactivity indicated a nuclear accident at a facility dealing with spent nuclear fuel or a facility for radioactive medicine between the ural mountains and the volga river in late september. However, russian state nuclear company rosatom, which owns the mayak facility, denies it's the source of the radioactivity, per reuters. Previously, rosatom denied that ruthenium 106 had even been detected in the region between sept. 25 and oct. 7.

Each week, scientists change out air filters in the detectors and take the used ones to a technical university near copenhagen. There, sven poul nielsen and other researchers analyze the filters. They often snag small amounts of naturally occurring radioactivity, radon for example. Then about a month ago, nielsen was startled to find something far stranger: a radioactive isotope known as ruthenium-106. Ruthenium-106 has a half-life of just one year, which means that it isn't naturally found on earth. It is, however, created in the glowing cores of nuclear reactors — and usually only detected in the atmosphere when something goes terribly wrong. The ruthenium was detected far beyond denmark. It showed up all across europe, from cyprus to spain. The levels seen in dozens of nations were far too low to pose a health risk. Within weeks, the thin cloud had vanished.

When researchers in russia recorded a pair of black sea bottlenose dolphins in a pool, it sounded as if they were chatting — and quite politely, at that. Each dolphin would listen to the other without interruption before responding. While researchers have known for a while that dolphins could communicate via clicks or whistles, this study found that they also altered the frequency and volume of their sounds. As a result, researchers say the aquatic duo could form sentences of up to five \" words, \" though scientists had no idea what they were going on about. The dolphins ' communication skills exhibit \" all the design features present in the human spoken language, \" writes lead researcher vyacheslav ryabov in the journal mathematics and physics. \" their language can be ostensibly considered a highly developed spoken language. \" now, says ryabov, it is up to humans to decode dolphin speak. Their high-frequency sounds are beyond the human range of hearing, notes the christian science monitor, but scientists could use equipment to capture and mimic those sounds, then respond in a way the dolphins would theoretically understand. Australian researchers have previously pinpointed particular whistles the mammals use to communicate ideas such as, \" there's food over here, \" per the telegraph. ( last year, scientists using 3d imaging figured out how dolphins \" see \" with sound. )",

Scientists already knew that dolphins use more than one thousand different types of whistle depending on social context but it was unclear if they could communicate directly with each other, one to one.

        "summary": "A popular iraqi reality tv show depicts victims of isis attacks facing apparent terrorists who confess for the cameras — a \" surreal \" program designed to shore up interest in the war against sunni militants, the ap reports. Amid cartoons, psas, and dozens of other pro-war programs, in the grip of the law does well in its friday-night slot. The show includes police evidence and re-enactments by terrorists at the crime scene, newsweek reports, but encounters with victims are clearly highpoints. \" give him to me — i ' ll tear him to pieces, \" says the relative of a terror-attack victim when faced with haider ali motar, the convicted assailant. Motar weeps when confronted by a wheel-chair bound man whose father died in the attack. But human-rights advocates say these encounters stem from a deeply troubled justice system that routinely obtains \" confessions \" through torture. \" the show is more evidence that law reform is desperately needed in iraq, \" says a human rights watch executive. Isis isn't too thrilled about it either, apparently, for the show's host, ahmed hassan, has received death threats and been moved into a fortified compound. The show's state tv broadcaster, iraqiya, has already seen more than 100 staff members killed since 2003, more than half by assassins in anti-government groups. Yet iraqi authorities still support in the grip of the law: \" we are at war on terrorism, and this program is one of our psychological tools to fight the terrorists, \" says a top federal police officer.",

        "summary": "Bronx morgue workers allegedly sent the corpse of an 85-year-old woman to be dissected at albert einstein college — despite the fact that her body was never supposed to be used as a teaching aide. Now, the family of aura ballesteros, who died may 16, plans to sue the city, the new york daily news reports. State law dictates unclaimed corpses can be donated to medical schools or buried in potter's field after 14 days, but son hector had special permission from the medical examiner's office to keep his mother's body at the jacobi medical center morgue until june 16 as he made funeral arrangements with his sisters in colombia. Even so, her body was shipped to the medical school on june 2. \" the person ( in the bronx morgue ) who took the call ( from the main office in manhattan ) to hold the body failed to make a note of it, \" the medical examiner's office chief of staff says, insisting the body was embalmed but never dissected before being returned. \" supposedly, \" hector ballesteros says, \" all the organs and the brain are inside her. But, he adds, \" the face is changed \" after the embalming process. This isn't the only recent flub for nyc's medical examiner's office, the new york post reports — the agency is currently being investigated for possible misconduct. In one alleged incident, the wrong body was cremated; in another, the corpse of a 71-year-old woman was lost — and 300 bodies had to be exhumed in a vain attempt to find it.",

Andrew young's family asked for his body to be sent to a funeral home for cremation — but the me's office allegedly sent nathan's, instead.

        "summary": "\" this is going to be a travesty. The contamination could be going anywhere, \" says a houston-area resident who lives a block away from an old wood-treating facility flooded by hurricane harvey. The new york times reports the facility is one of two dozen superfund sites potentially leaking lead, arsenic, and other carcinogens in the wake of the storm. Those toxins would join runoff from potentially hundreds of petroleum and chemical facilities, as well as raw sewage from an over-taxed waste system. \" it's contaminated. There's millions of contaminants, \" a spokesperson for the houston health department says of the water that's flooding nearly 30 % of the city. Officials are urging residents to stay out of the water, but that's much easier said than done. And it's not just the flood water that's posing a danger to long-term health. A flooded chemical plant spewing toxic smoke has sent 15 people to the hospital, new republic reports. And more than 2 million pounds of hazardous substances have been put into the air by oil facilities shutting down in the wake of harvey. Their effect on air quality will likely be even worse when they start back up — without the storm's wind and rain to disperse the pollutants. A local environmental justice organizer calls the situation \" terrifying. \" meanwhile, feces may have gotten into wells used by residents in dozens of counties and could \" cause massive epidemics in a matter of days, \" says an expert on contaminated water. Texas gov. Greg abbott says it could end up costing more than $ 125 billion in aid to clean up the whole mess, reuters reports.",

        "summary": "New york university has a plan to encourage more medical students to pursue careers in lower-paying specialties: alleviate the six-figure debt that comes with pursuing a medical degree. To do that, nyu will now give all of its medical students a free ride, the wall street journal reports. The huge amount of debt that medical students graduate with — a median of $ 195,000 in loans — is one of the reasons that they choose to pursue higher-paying specialties, according to nbc. The result is a shortage of primary care physicians and researchers, per the wsj. For instance, a plastic surgeon earns about $ 473,000 a year on average, while a pediatric doctor makes about $ 222,000. \" if you're faced with debt that you're likely to have into your 50s, it's got to have an influence on what you choose to do, \" lee goldman, dean of the columbia university medical school tells the paper. Other schools, including columbia, are making efforts to ease the tuition burden on medical students. But the nyu program to cover 100 % of tuition for all medical students is \" a first among the nation's major medical schools, \" per the wsj. So far, nyu has raised $ 450 million of $ 600 million it says it will need to fund the program. More than 450 new and current students will benefit — though they will still need to pay about $ 29,000 a year for room, board, and living expenses.",

            "The adult primary care \"physician shortage \" is more accurately portrayed as a gap between the adult population's demand for primary care services and the capacity of primary care, as currently delivered, to meet that demand. Given current trends, producing more adult primary care clinicians will not close the demand-capacity gap. However, primary care capacity can be greatly increased without many more clinicians: by empowering licensed personnel, including registered nurses and pharmacists, to provide more care; by creating standing orders for nonlicensed health personnel, such as medical assistants, to function as panel managers and health coaches to address many preventive and chronic care needs; by increasing the potential for more patient self-care; and by harnessing technology to add capacity. The health policy literature has been inundated with articles on the worsening shortage of primary care physicians. 1 – 3 one projection estimates that by 2020 the shortage will balloon to 40,000 physicians. 4 a more recent estimate suggests a gap of 52,000 primary care physicians by 2025. 5 the problem particularly affects primary care for adults more so than for children.

        "summary": "It's known that a runner's high isn't actually the result of endorphins, which are too large to cross the blood-brain barrier, but scientists have long sought the elusive cause of the much-talked-about sense of euphoria and calm that can accompany the end of a workout. Now researchers are reporting in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that endocannabinoids — chemicals that the new york times describes as, \" essentially, internally produced marijuana \" — are behind the subtly intoxicating effects of exercise. To test this, researchers conditioned mice to run on a treadmill, then let one group run for five hours and forced the second to be inactive. All mice were then watched for signs of anxiety ( i.e. Preference for darkness, pain intolerance, etc. ). Then, in a second experiment that looked nearly identical, the researchers added endocannabinoid and endorphin antagonists to block their effects. This time the mice who ran did not exhibit the reduced anxiety associated with a runner's high, reports cbs atlanta. The results can't be directly translated to humans, but the fact that such tiny animals have to run three miles a day to produce a runner's high may suggest that humans have evolved to be in motion. \" the subtle upshot of the new study may be that we should run, \" writes gretchen reynolds in the times. \" and if we don't feel a high, perhaps try running more, until eventually a gentle euphoria may settle in and we can turn to our running companion and say, ' ah, my endocannabinoids are kicking in at last!

Ablation of cannabinoid receptor 1 receptors on gabaergic neurons inhibits running-induced anxiolysis, and pharmacological blockage of central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors inhibits analgesia.

In a quinnipiac university poll released thursday, 46 % of republican voters say they support attacking north korea, while 41 % are opposed to a preemptive strike, the washington post reports. Those numbers come after months of amped-up rhetoric between trump and north korean leader kim jong un over pyongyang's nuclear testing. During a speech at the united nations last month, trump said the us would have no choice but to \" totally destroy \" north korea \" if it is forced to defend itself or its allies. \" in general, american voters oppose a preemptive strike 62 % to 26 %. In addition, a large majority of the country doesn't trust trump to handle the situation with north korea at all, newsweek reports. Rather, voters say, by a margin of 65 % to 28 %, that they have confidence in \" top national security and diplomatic officials \" to handle the situation. \" voters don't have confidence in president donald trump to handle north korea, but they're hoping other members of the trump team will step up, \" tim malloy, assistant director of the quinnipiac university poll, says.",

Reporting in the journal jama psychiatry, researchers say that among the 43 women and 36 men they examined, all of whom were healthy and showing no signs of alzheimer's, people with high levels of amyloid plaque in their cortex were 7.5 times more likely to be classified as feeling lonely, even after accounting for possible contributing factors such as social activity, depression, and anxiety. The sticky amyloid plaques are, along with tau tangles, the top signs of alzheimer's, and can be seen as much as decades before symptoms set in. And while the study doesn't prove cause-and-effect, as upi reports, it hints at an elevated risk of alzheimer's among healthy seniors who report feelings of loneliness. \" people who are starting to accumulate amyloid may not be as well-functioning in terms of perceiving, understanding or responding to social stimuli or interactions, \" says lead researcher dr. Nancy donovan. So while loneliness doesn't necessarily lead to dementia, it can be a sign of it, suggesting a potential build-up of amyloid plaque in the part of the brain that plays a key role in memory, attention, and perception.

Researchers note that children under 10 possess weak neck muscles and relatively large heads, a \" hypermobility \" that makes them more vulnerable to such tears, \" albeit rarely. \" six months after this event, which doctors treated with low-dose aspirin, the boy still has weakness on his left side but is able to move his arm, grip objects, talk normally, perform above average in school, and even take karate lessons, which is part of his therapy, reports cbs news.

This type of injury is also known to occur from whiplash, such as as in a car accident or while playing certain sports. The boy's parents said he was in good health before riding two roller coasters in may 2013 while the family was vacationing out of state. The first roller coaster was 679 feet long and 30 feet high and the acceleration reached 25 miles per hour. At its highest and fastest, the second ride was 53 feet above ground and moved at a speed of 40",

        "summary": "Baltimore police have suspended six officers with pay as part of a probe into the death of freddie gray, who a lawyer claims had his spinal cord severed in police custody. At a press conference yesterday, baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake said she was \" frustrated \" by a lack of information, but she called for calm amid continued protests. Police, meanwhile, said they were still unsure how or when gray was injured, the new york times reports. Commissioner anthony batts admitted officers were slow to realize gray needed medical attention; he reportedly asked for an asthma inhaler but wasn't carrying one. \" we should have probably asked for paramedics \" sooner, he said. But though gray suffered \" a very tragic injury to his spinal cord, \" deputy police commissioner jerry rodriguez added, \" we have no evidence — physical, video, or statements — of any use of force. \" an autopsy found no other wounds. Batts said the police department has already made changes to its policies regarding the transport of suspects and the treatment of those requiring medical attention in custody. He added that the results of the investigation, which should be completed may 1, would be passed to the state's attorney for baltimore, who says she will \" independently investigate this matter to determine whether criminal charges will be brought. \" police documents say gray, who was previously arrested on drug charges, was taken into custody \" without force or incident \" for carrying a switchblade after he made eye contact with an officer on april 12, then ran away. \" there is no law against running, \" batts said, per the baltimore sun. He was loaded into a police van, which stopped twice before arriving at the western district station, where an ambulance was called. Gray was placed in leg shackles during one stop as the driver said he was \" acting irate. \" the van also picked up another suspect, who was separated from gray by a metal barrier.",

The spokesman adds that the first baby had been taken to the hospital one time before he was found dead in a bassinet at home. Another revelation in that case, per the times: just weeks before she gave birth to the baby boy, berry left her employ with the nyc administration for children's services, where she worked in the child protective services branch for about six months. Berry's boyfriend, meanwhile, who isn't facing charges, told police that he thought berry had had an abortion, that he was in another room both when the baby was born and when she went out the window, and that he had no idea either incident had happened, nbc new york reports. A woman seen going into berry's home wednesday had nothing to say, save, \" it's a family tragedy, please go away, \" per the journal news. Who did have a lot to say: berry's neighbors, who tell people they're shocked by the baby's death. \" i can't sleep since i found out that baby was thrown out a window moments after being born, \" one tells the magazine. \" if i had that woman in front of me, i don't know what i'd do. \" ( the body of a girl killed nearly 50 years ago was recently exhumed in hopes of finding out more about her case. )",

        "summary": "A chicago woman imprisoned in indonesia for the 2014 killing of her mother says in videos posted on youtube that she acted alone and her boyfriend only helped her cover it up because she threatened him. In a series of three videos that were posted last week, 21-year-old heather mack says her then-boyfriend tommy schaefer falsely confessed to striking her 62-year-old mother, sheila von wiese-mack, in the head with a metal fruit bowl during their trip to bali. She says he only helped her stuff the body in a suitcase and clean up because she threatened to tell police that he committed the crime. Authorities have said that the two discussed killing von wiese-mack in text messages, but in the videos mack says that she took his phone when he was asleep and exchanged text messages with herself to make it appear the two were texting each other. She says when she asked schaefer to help her find someone who would kill her mother for $ 50,000 he refused. \" tommy's an innocent man, \" says mack, who has cellphone and internet access in prison. She says one reason she framed schaefer was because she knew there was a chance she would be arrested after she killed her mother and \" i didn't want to get arrested by myself in a different country. \" schaefer was in 2015 sentenced to 18 years in prison and mack received a 10-year prison sentence, reports the ap. The motive for killing von wiese-mack was revenge, suggests mack in the videos: the chicago tribune reports she says \" two weeks before i came to bali, i found out that [ my mother ] killed my father \" in a hotel in athens. Mack gives no additional detail; her father, well-known jazz composer james l. Mack, died on vacation in 2006.",

His father says he was brainwashed by extremists, reports cnn, which notes that the other two bataclan attackers were also french citizens who had traveled to the middle east. The gunman's mother went to authorities after receiving a chilling text message, apparently from mohamed-aggad's wife, reading: \" your son died a martyr with his brothers on november 13, \" her lawyer tells afp. The lawyer says the mother went straight to police, who used her dna to determine that her son had been among the attackers. The bbc reports that apart from two men who were killed at a checkpoint, the other men in the strasbourg group have all returned to france and been arrested, including mohamed-aggad's brother, karim.

Both houses of russia's parliament have backed vastly increased fines against \" unauthorized \" demonstrations; putin is expected to sign the measure into law within days.

Some 38 % of russians oppose the bill, whose fines are higher than the country's average income; two-thirds say it's time for talks between putin and the opposition, notes the moscow times. The move comes ahead of a giant rally set for tuesday, der spiegel reports. The measure was introduced following protests against putin's potential 12 years in office. Meanwhile, protests are continuing, with 10 detained yesterday — and the bill could backfire, prompting more russians to take to the streets.

        "summary": "The $ 4.5 billion criminal penalty that bp had to pay for the catastrophic deepwater horizon oil spill was pretty hefty, but a new orleans judge may be about to triple that fine. Nearly five years after the disaster that dumped hundreds of millions of gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico and killed 11 workers, judge carl barbier is mulling details of the federal case against the oil company to assess a fine, which may reach a maximum amount of $ 13.7 billion, the guardian reports. This next phase of the case against bp was reached after barbier's september ruling that the spill was due to bp's \" reckless \" conduct, as well as his decision on thursday that although 4 million barrels streamed into the gulf, bp should only be held responsible for 3.19 million barrels thanks to its cleanup efforts, saving the company billions of dollars, the new york times reports. Barbier's numbers are much lower than the government's estimate of nearly 5 million barrels of oil that flooded the gulf, but still higher than bp's claim of 3.26 million barrels ( 2.45 million after cleanup ), the times notes. Each barrel carries a maximum clean water act fine of $ 4,300, so the government's estimate could have meant an $ 18 billion penalty. Barbier indicated that differing data from both sides were \" voluminous, dense, highly technical, and conflicting, \" per the times. \" there is no way to know with precision how much oil discharged into the gulf of mexico, \" he wrote. Although the justice department and bp are reviewing last week's ruling ( with bp lawyers arguing that dropping oil prices should factor into the fine, the wall street journal adds ), an ex-prosecutor for environmental crimes tells the times that the decision was \" a major victory for bp. \"",

Judge carl j. Barbier of federal district court in new orleans issued the ruling on thursday. In a 44-page finding of fact that anticipates the coming third phase of the sprawling federal case over the spill, judge barbier wrote that the company actually spilled four million barrels of oil into the gulf but, considering its collection efforts, bp should be held responsible for a net discharge of 3.19 million, or about 134 million gallons. The estimated number of barrels is substantially less than the five million barrels experts for the federal government estimated ( 4.19 million after taking collection efforts into account ), and substantially more than the 3.26 million the company said had been released ( 2.45 million after collection ).

Researchers were able to access previously unpublished mortality data from a nearly five-decades-old study of 458 heart disease patients. The data revealed that while the group that switched from saturated fatty acids ( ie, butter ) to polyunsaturated fatty acids ( in this case, safflower oil and safflower margarine ) did indeed see a 13 % drop in cholesterol, they were more likely to die from cardiovascular or coronary heart disease. As the daily mail reports, this is the only \" randomized controlled study \" to look at the increased consumption of omega 6. Also known as linoleic acid, it's found in margarine made from corn, sunflower, safflower, and soybean oil and happens to be the most common pufa found in most western diets. The body converts it to arachidonic acid, which can ultimately spur inflammation... Which just so happens to be a leading cause of heart disease. But the mail spoke with a number of scientists who pooh-poohed the study, with one calling it \" enormously underpowered. \"",

The lawyer has filed new paperwork in a california court calling for a hearing that could close the case for good. His two reasons for justifying a hearing: he accuses prosecutors of providing false information when they recently attempted to have the director extradited from poland ( the extradition request called polanski a \" continuing flight risk \" even though he had appeared for questioning in poland voluntarily, among other things ), and he says that new testimony reveals a superior court judge in 2009 \" unethically prejudged issues \" surrounding the polanski prosecution that had not yet been argued in court, the new york times reports. That judge oversaw the legal fight that started in 2008 after documentary roman polanski: wanted and desired was released, and the new testimony comes from a former public information officer of the court, who says the judge was willing to ultimately limit polanski's sentence to time served should he actually return to the us, but that he planned to let him \" cool his heels in jail \" first by delaying his ruling for weeks. Polanski's lawyers are arguing that, as the now-81-year-old director spent 42 days in prison for psychiatric evaluation under a plea deal back when the case started, and only fled when he discovered the judge planned to give him more jail time despite an off-the-record agreement not to do so, he has actually already served his sentence in full.

The suit against ucsf benioff children's hospital oakland and surgeon frederick rosen presents a disturbing account of the family's experience: vast quantities of blood poured from the teen's mouth after her tonsillectomy and requests for a doctor were delayed before the hospital insisted mcmath was dead and urged the family to donate her organs. Rosen, the suit alleges, didn't tell nurses that mcmath had an abnormal throat artery that made surgery more dangerous. Within half an hour of the surgery, the girl was coughing up \" buckets of blood, \" according to the mercury news account of the suit. When she began to bleed, the filing holds, nurses said it was \" normal, \" the san francisco chronicle reports. A nurse said the blood should be suctioned, but an hour into the process, another nurse said that was highly dangerous, the suit says. Hours after the family sought a doctor, one arrived, allegedly saying \" ( expletive ), her heart stopped. \" days later, tests showed no brain function. Hospital workers, the suit says, pushed the family to donate mcmath's organs, even raising the matter while her mother was praying in a hospital chapel. \" what is it you don't understand? \" the hospital's pediatrics head allegedly said at one point. \" she is dead, dead, dead, dead. \"",

Vivek murthy says more people are hooked on prescription opioids than tobacco, 50 % more people ( 20.8 million, per recent estimates ) have substance abuse disorders than have cancer, and dealing with all of these disorders runs the us more than $ 420 billion a year. And it's not something we can turn a blind eye to any longer, murthy warns. \" at a time when we are resource constrained already, we cannot afford, for humanitarian reasons or financial reasons, to not address addiction in america, \" murthy tells usa today. And he lays out the financial side of things in stark numbers: for every dollar put into addiction treatment programs, for example, $ 4 in health care costs and $ 7 in criminal justice costs are recouped. Which means we have to reframe how we look at people with substance abuse problems, murthy notes, viewing them not as criminals but as patients — especially since only one in 10 currently receive treatment, per the new york times. \" we have to recognize [ it ] isn't evidence of a character flaw or a moral failing, \" he says. \" it's a chronic disease of the brain that deserves the same compassion that any other chronic illness does. \" he tells npr that preventive measures should start in schools, teaching kids how to handle stress without drugs or alcohol. He also notes obamacare has upped access to treatment programs, and he's now looking to the trump administration to show similar support. \" i am hopeful that we are all on the same page when it comes to addressing this crisis — and addressing it urgently, \" he tells npr.

The missionary, who spent most of her life working with the poor in india, was beatified in 2003, and the ap reports that pope francis has now attributed a second miracle to her, clearing the final barrier to sainthood. The vatican says francis signed off on the miracle thursday during a meeting with the congregation for the causes of saints, which serves as the vatican's office in charge of saint-making. The decision was first reported in italian newspaper avvenire, which reuters notes has been \" well informed about similar stories in the past. \" the miracle that francis signed off on involved a 35-year-old man in brazil who was near death from a brain infection in 2008 and made an incredible recovery after relatives, including his new bride, prayed to mother teresa, according to avvenire. The vatican hasn't announced a date for teresa's canonization, but it's expected to be in early september, to coincide with the date of the nun's death in 1997 at the age of 87, reports the ap.

Il che significa che una simile guarigione supera le capacità della natura quanto alla sostanza, cioè è impossibile, non potrebbe mai verificarsi. Il primo grado dei miracoli è quello cui appartiene la risurrezione dai morti o la restitutio ad integrum, dove non solo si riscontra la completa guarigione ma anche la restituzione integrale degli organi distrutti dalla malattia. Non sono molti i casi riconosciuti di miracolo che appartengono al primo grado.

        "summary": "One of the big contests still undecided after election night is the race for senator in mississippi, and a controversial new video is getting a lot of attention ahead of the nov. 27 runoff. In the video, gop incumbent cindy hyde-smith is seen campaigning with a supporter in tupelo, and she says, \"if he invited me to a public hanging, i'd be on the front row, \" reports mississippi today. Hyde-smith is now taking criticism given that she's a white lawmaker running against a black challenger, mike espy, in a southern state. But she says the criticism is overblown: \"in referencing the one who invited me, i used an exaggerated expression of regard, and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous. \" the campaign of espy, a former congressman and agriculture secretary, calls the remarks \" reprehensible, \" reports politico. \" they have no place in our political discourse, in mississippi, or our country. \" naacp chief derrick johnston voiced a similar sentiment, calling the joke \" sick \" and adding, \" any politician seeking to serve as the national voice of the people of mississippi should know better. \" hyde-smith was appointed to office in april to fill the seat of longtime sen. Thad cochran, who retired. She and espy were the top two finishers in the special election to serve out the final two years of cochran's term, but because neither got 50 % of the vote, a runoff is necessary. ( a voter in mississippi lost his job because of the shirt he wore to the voting booth. )",

Back in 2005, a uk psychologist named cliff arnall of cardiff university came up with a formula that factored in the weather, holiday debts, new year's resolutions gone bust, etc., to pinpoint the date. In fact, arnall says 2017's blue monday might be the bluest of all because of factors such as the spate of celebrity deaths in 2016 and trepidation among many about donald trump and brexit, reports the telegraph. Does this all sound a little half-baked? well, you're not alone in thinking so, notes usa today. The date was cooked up to \" sell summer holidays, \" writes isabella goldie of mental health foundation in london in a blog post. \"since then it has become a yearly pr event and primarily a device to promote and sell things, often tenuously linked, to improving our well-being. \" now, there's something to it, she notes, given factors such as seasonal affective disorder, but she thinks the title trivializes genuine mental anguish. In fact, as nbc news observes, most of the links to the trending #bluemonday hashtag on twitter were advertisements for things like florida getaways or rejuvenating skin cream.

But they also found that most people don't spend their money in this way. \" few people are doing it even when they can afford it, \" elizabeth dunn, the study's senior author, says in a science daily news release. \" lots of research has shown that people benefit from buying their way into pleasant experiences, but our research suggests people should also consider buying their way out of unpleasant experiences. \" the team surveyed more than 6,000 adults in the us, canada, denmark, and the netherlands about their budgets. They also studied groups of subjects who spent money on either material goods or services to save them time. In both cases, and across incomes, they found spending money to save time made people happier. And yet, in a small sample of 98 working adults, only 2 % chose to spend a $ 40 windfall to save time. Among a larger sample of 850 millionaires, far more said they hire help for the things they don't like doing, but it still only amounted to roughly half of the sample. Dunn tells the cbc this doesn't only involve outsourcing chores; even little things, like shopping at a grocery store that's closer to home even if it costs more, has an impact. \" what we think is that buying time protects people from the negative effects of time stress in daily life, \" she says.

A study by the university of british columbia and harvard business school, published monday in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, has found buying time makes people happier than buying material things. Ubc psychology professor and study author elizabeth dunn said although the idea of being happier by having someone clean your home or do other unwanted chores seems obvious, the study found even small investments like shopping at a more expensive, but closer-to-home, grocery store makes a difference.

            "Significance despite rising incomes, people around the world are feeling increasingly pressed for time, undermining well-being. We show that the time famine of modern life can be reduced by using money to buy time. Surveys of large, diverse samples from four countries reveal that spending money on time-saving services is linked to greater life satisfaction. To establish causality, we show that working adults report greater happiness after spending money on a time-saving purchase than on a material purchase. This research reveals a previously unexamined route from wealth to well-being: spending money to buy free time. Abstract around the world, increases in wealth have produced an unintended consequence: a rising sense of time scarcity. We provide evidence that using money to buy time can provide a buffer against this time famine, thereby promoting happiness. Using large, diverse samples from the united states, canada, denmark, and the netherlands ( n = 6,271 ), we show that individuals who spend money on time-saving services report greater life satisfaction. A field experiment provides causal evidence that working adults report greater happiness after spending money on a time-saving purchase than on a material purchase. Together, these results suggest that using money to buy time can protect people from the detrimental effects of time pressure on life satisfaction.

            "For people who wish there were more hours in the day, spending a bit of money to get rid of onerous tasks would make them much happier, but researchers say very few actually make the investment. A study by the university of british columbia and harvard business school, published monday in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, has found buying time makes people happier than buying material things. Ubc psychology professor and study author elizabeth dunn said although the idea of being happier by having someone clean your home or do other unwanted chores seems obvious, the study found even small investments like shopping at a more expensive, but closer-to-home, grocery store makes a difference. Protects from time stress \" theoretically what we think is that buying time protects people from the negative effects of time stress in daily life, \" she said. \" when you're rushing around, feeling pressed for time, that seems to take a bit of a toll on people's day-to-day happiness. \" researchers gave 60 people taking part in the study in vancouver $ 40 to spend on two weekends. The first time they were told to use the money on any material item they wanted. Dunn said people reported buying a nice bottle of wine, clothes and board games. Researchers then surveyed the group to determine their level of",
            "Significance despite rising incomes, people around the world are feeling increasingly pressed for time, undermining well-being. We show that the time famine of modern life can be reduced by using money to buy time. Surveys of large, diverse samples from four countries reveal that spending money on time-saving services is linked to greater life satisfaction. To establish causality, we show that working adults report greater happiness after spending money on a time-saving purchase than on a material purchase. This research reveals a previously unexamined route from wealth to well-being: spending money to buy free time. Abstract around the world, increases in wealth have produced an unintended consequence: a rising sense of time scarcity. We provide evidence that using money to buy time can provide a buffer against this time famine, thereby promoting happiness.

An important bird and biodiversity area, as well as the third largest offshore island in the archipelago at 20 miles long by 4 miles wide, pebble island was purchased by sam harris ' great-great-grandfather for roughly $ 500 in 1869 as he set up what the bbc describes as a fish curing business. Now powered by a wind turbine and solar panels, the island boasts small mountains, lakes, and cliffs; lodges for tourists; a thriving sheep farm; 125 beef cattle; and many penguins, \" from burrowing and inquisitive gentoos to rockhoppers bouncing up and down the cliffs, \" harris tells walesonline. \" it's an incredible place, but it literally couldn't be further away. \" it's certainly easier to get to pebble island from wales than it was in the 1800s, when a one-way trip meant a two-week boat journey. But it's still easier to get to australia in modern times, per the bbc. A supply ship does visit the island, a 45-minute plane ride from the falklands capital of stanley, every six weeks. But as no family members have lived there since the 1950s, harris says \" it's too much work to keep going. \" the family doesn't have a set price for the island, which hosts the site of the first land-based action of the 1982 falklands war, but hopes to sell to a local with an interest in farming. Harris ' mother, who currently manages the island from the uk, puts it this way, per metro: \" a foreign person would have to offer a substantial amount more than a falkland islander for us to accept it. \" ( in la, 157 acres carry a price tag of $ 1 billion. )",
