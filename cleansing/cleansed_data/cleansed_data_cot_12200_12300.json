Democratic insiders say her name is coming up quite a bit in discussions of potential senate candidates in her home state of kansas, the new york times reports. Sebelius is considering the idea, says one source to the paper who has spoken to her. Democrats see sebelius as their best chance at winning kansas, which hasn't had a democratic senator since 1939. If she were to run, she would likely face sen. Pat roberts, an old friend who slammed her for \" gross incompetence \" in implementing obamacare; the times paints a sebelius run as a move for \" revenge. \" running for his fourth term at age 77, roberts is seen as a potential target; a sebelius campaign would at least force gop spending in the state, the newspaper notes. Still, she hasn't won a race in kansas since 2006, mediaite observes, and many who know her say she's unlikely to run after her recent bout as the focus of republican ire.",

The verdict was met by an outpouring of grief from crowds outside the court, as well as condemnation from the un and human rights organizations, the bbc reports. Defense teams weren't allowed to make their cases in trials that lasted only a few hours each, human rights watch complains. Only some 50 of those sentenced are currently in custody; if others turn themselves in, they're reportedly eligible for a retrial. A final ruling is set for june. The sentences now head to the country's leading religious authority, the grand mufti — but its decision tends to be a \" formality, \" the bbc notes. That ruling \" won't mean anything to the judge, \" an official tells the ap. \" only the judge has the right and the power to reverse his earlier decisions. \" an hrw director tells reuters that \" the decisions are possibly the largest possible death sentences in recent world history. \" in further rulings: the court reversed a death sentence for 529 other brotherhood backers, leaving 37 sentenced to death while most of the rest received life in prison. Those sentences were also tied to the august police station attack in minya province. The court didn't tell waiting relatives which 37 people had been sentenced to death, a bbc correspondent says.

The alleged victim, who had reportedly been in a relationship with samantha ray mears for seven years before they broke up, told police he came home friday night and mears came out from behind his bedroom door holding a machete, which she then placed to his neck as she ordered him to take off his clothes, the great falls tribune reports. She allegedly took off her own pants and forced him to have intercourse with her, continuing to hold on to the machete the whole time, krtv reports. When he tried to push her off him, she allegedly bit his arm and continued attempting to have sex despite him telling her to stop, kfbb reports. They then started arguing, the man says, and mears allegedly pulled some trim off the wall and peed on the bed. The alleged victim was able to take pictures of mears sitting naked on the bed wielding the machete, which he provided to police. Finally, he was able to call 911 and pretend to be talking to a friend so mears wouldn't know he'd called police; he and his sister, who had arrived home during the ordeal, escaped the house just as police got there. Mears, who was also charged with felony strangulation against the same man in april, now faces six new charges, including assault, burglary, and more.",

        "summary": "Greece delivered a resounding \" no \" to creditors'demands for tough austerity measures in return for continued bailout aid — and while the development is being widely described as huge, nobody is sure exactly what it will mean for the country, or for the european union. But with the country's banks almost out of cash, the next two days are expected to be crucial for greece's future. Key developments: finance minister yanis varoufakis will not be guiding the country on its journey into uncharted territory, the ap reports. He resigned early today, saying prime minister alexis tsipras believed it would be easier to reach a deal with creditors if he left. The \" no \" vote, he said, \" will stay in history as a unique moment when a small european nation rose up against debt-bondage, \" and he \" shall wear the creditors ' loathing with pride. \" there will be plenty of talks in the days ahead, including an emergency eurozone summit tomorrow night, but some analysts believe greece and its creditors have now moved so far apart that a greek exit from the eurozone is a lot more likely than a new deal, which tsipras insists must involve a restructuring of debt. Germany's deputy chancellor sigmar gabriel says tsipras has \" torn down the last bridges, across which europe and greece could move toward a compromise, \" the bbc reports. Greek banks are supposed to reopen tomorrow, but they are believed to have just $ 1.1 billion in cash on hand — which will probably be snapped up very quickly by anxious greeks — and whether they get more will be up to the european central bank, reports the new york times. Bank officials will meet today to decide whether to extend emergency loans to the greek banks despite the referendum result. If the banks do collapse from lack of cash, one outcome could be them reopening with a different currency, the bbc notes — or, alternatively, it could be a development worrying enough to persuade european authorities to work harder on a new deal. European leaders are still working on their response to the \" no \" vote, which is seen as a huge setback for german chancellor angela merkel in particular, the guardian reports. A british government spokesman says the uk will do \" whatever is necessary to protect its economic security. \" the markets, meanwhile, have begun to deliver their verdict: asian markets and oil prices dropped significantly in early trading today, although the euro has held steady so far.",

Beijing lodged an official diplomatic protest saturday over trump's phone conversation with taiwanese president tsai ing-wen, which is believed to be the first time in 37 years that a us president or president-elect has spoken directly to a leader of what china still considers to be a renegade province, reports reuters. \" we have already made solemn representations about it to the relevant us side. It must be pointed out that there is only one china in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of china's territory, \" china's foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that the \" one china principle is the political basis of the china-us relationship. \" a round-up of coverage: a white house spokesman declined to comment friday on whether beijing had been in touch about the trump call, reports the washington post. Ned price stressed to reporters that there has been no change to us policy on taiwan. In a tweet as the controversy grew on friday, trump said it had been the taiwanese leader that called him. In a follow-up tweet, he said: \" interesting how the u.s. Sells taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but i should not accept a congratulatory call. \" the guardian reports that an editorial in the government-controlled global times tabloid warned trump against getting any closer to taiwan, while expressing hope that he would gain a better understanding of the situation after taking office. \" if trump wants to overstep the one-china principle, he will destroy sino-us ties, \" the paper said. \" that means the current pattern between beijing and washington as well as international order will be overturned. We believe this is not what trump wants. \" sources tell the taipei times that trump agreed to the call, which was arranged by \" taiwan-friendly members of his campaign staff \" after they briefed him on the issues involved. Cnn reports that when asked about the call saturday, chinese foreign minister wang yi downplayed it as a \" shenanigan by the taiwan side, \" adding that the one china policy is the foundation of healthy us-china relations, and saying he hopes that foundation \" won't be disrupted or damaged. \" xinhua reports that on friday, before controversy erupted, henry kissinger was in beijing and met with president xi jinping. \" the development of china-us ties since the forging of diplomatic ties has proven our common interests far outweigh differences, \" xi is quoted as saying.

A team led by dr.

And those three studies \" yielded a rate of outpatient diagnostic errors of 5.08 %, \" per the report. \" it is surprising — 5 %, \" singh says of the percent of cases where the first diagnosis was wrong, but the information for a correct diagnosis was present. And one patient safety expert sees that figure as conservative. \" i would say this is a minimum. \" experts tell modern healthcare that there are likely numerous reasons for the lapses, among them the way primary care is structured in the us. \" doctors just don't have much time \" due to \" the pressure to move patients in and out, \" an american cancer society official points out, noting physicians typically have just 10 minutes to arrive at their diagnosis.

The move is intended to recognize a broader range of family structures in legal cases, like those where a same-sex couple shares financial or custody responsibilities with a biological parent of the opposite sex, reports the la times. \" courts need the ability to recognize these changes so children are supported by the adults that play a central role in loving and caring for them, \" says sen.

The bill was partially inspired after a 2011 case, in which a girl ended up in foster care after one of her mothers went to hospital and the other was incarcerated, but her biological father did not have any parental rights. Gov. Brown had opposed a similar bill last year, but has not commented on why he changed his mind and signed this one.

            "Sacramento — gov. Jerry brown signed legislation friday that will allow children in california to have more than two legal parents, a measure opposed by some conservative groups as an attack on the traditional family. Sen. Mark leno ( d-san francisco ) said he authored the measure to address the changes in family structure in california, including situations in which same-sex couples have a child with an opposite-sex biological parent. The law will allow the courts to recognize three or more legal parents so that custody and financial responsibility can be shared by all those involved in raising a child, leno said. \" courts need the ability to recognize these changes so children are supported by the adults that play a central role in loving and caring for them, \" leno said. \" it is critical that judges have the ability to recognize the roles of all parents so that no child has to endure separation from one of the adults he or she has always known as a parent. \" the bill was partially a reaction to a 2011 court decision involving a lesbian couple that briefly ended their relationship, according to leno's office. One of the women was impregnated by a man before the women resumed their relationship. A fight broke out, putting one of the women in the hospital and the other in jail, but the daughter was sent to",
            "A new california law will allow family courts to find, on rare occasions, that a child has more than two legal parents. State sen. Mark leno, d-san francisco, said his sb274 was designed for the unusual circumstance in which more than two people have legal claims of parentage, and a two-parent limit would be harmful to the child. Leno's office offered some examples from court cases: – a woman who broke up with her child's biological father, then lived with a man who became the child's main caretaker and who sought to establish a parental relationship after the couple separated. – a bisexual woman who lived with another woman but became pregnant with a man, with all three sharing parental responsibilities. – a lesbian who bore a child with a sperm donor, who helped her and her partner raise the child before the birth mother declared she was no longer a lesbian and moved to terminate the others ' parental rights.

            "Sacramento — gov. Jerry brown signed legislation friday that will allow children in california to have more than two legal parents, a measure opposed by some conservative groups as an attack on the traditional family. Sen. Mark leno ( d-san francisco ) said he authored the measure to address the changes in family structure in california, including situations in which same-sex couples have a child with an opposite-sex biological parent. The law will allow the courts to recognize three or more legal parents so that custody and financial responsibility can be shared by all those involved in raising a child, leno said. \" courts need the ability to recognize these changes so children are supported by the adults that play a central role in loving and caring for them, \" leno said. \" it is critical that judges have the ability to recognize the roles of all parents so that no child has to endure separation from one of the adults he or she has always known as a parent. \" the bill was partially a reaction to a 2011 court decision involving a lesbian couple that briefly ended their relationship, according to leno's office. One of the women was impregnated by a man before the women resumed their relationship. A fight broke out, putting one of the women in the hospital and the other in jail, but the daughter was sent to",
            "A new california law will allow family courts to find, on rare occasions, that a child has more than two legal parents. State sen. Mark leno, d-san francisco, said his sb274 was designed for the unusual circumstance in which more than two people have legal claims of parentage, and a two-parent limit would be harmful to the child. Leno's office offered some examples from court cases: – a woman who broke up with her child's biological father, then lived with a man who became the child's main caretaker and who sought to establish a parental relationship after the couple separated. – a bisexual woman who lived with another woman but became pregnant with a man, with all three sharing parental responsibilities. – a lesbian who bore a child with a sperm donor, who helped her and her partner raise the child before the birth mother declared she was no longer a lesbian and moved to terminate the others ' parental rights. In such cases, leno said, courts in four other states and washington, d.c., have the power to recognize three parents, who might seek custody, visitation or some other role in raising the child. He said california's two-parent limit has forced some judges to place children in foster care even though a third person who had played a parental role was"

Dale merza, 20, has been charged with misdemeanor hazing and faces up to 93 days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine if convicted, reports the detroit free press. But merza — who has pleaded not guilty, per wdiv — says the incident targeting 19-year-old andrew seely \" is simply not hazing. \" his lawyer, bruce leach, contends that the case \" has been blown way out of proportion by the individual's family members, who were not present and don't have any of the facts. \" the incident happened in october, but seely's mother only learned of it in march and posted on facebook about it, saying her son \" could have been killed. \" a professor took seely to a campus health clinic, where he recovered. His parents say members of the university's unofficial alpha chi rho fraternity, where the incident took place, were well aware of the seriousness of seely's allergy. But frat members disagree and say the action was meant as a harmless prank. They add that seely's decision to change schools at the end of the fall semester was unrelated, per the washington post. According to leach, merza and seely spoke after the incident and \" everything seemed to be fine. \" ( at penn state, a frat pledge sent a final text to his girlfriend on the night he died. )",

        "summary": "Donald trump is getting pilloried for a number of comments made during his extensive interview on fox news sunday, among them his view on intelligence briefings and his \" massive landslide victory... In the electoral college \" ( the latter not so much, historically speaking. ) but not all the response is domestic in nature: china on monday voiced its \" serious concern \" over trump's questioning of the united states'decades-old \" one china \" policy on taiwan. Ministry spokesman geng shuang was blunt in comments picked up by reuters: \" upholding the ' one china ' principle is the political basis for developing china-us ties. If this basis is interfered with or damaged then the healthy development of china-us relations and bilateral cooperation in important areas is out of the question. \" on sunday, the president-elect expressed that he saw no reason why we should be \" bound by a one china policy \" in the absence of a new \" deal \" with china's leaders. The wall street journal reminds why from a historical and contemporary view: adhering to that policy and severing official diplomatic ties with the taiwan government was a prerequisite in re-establishing those same ties with beijing in 1979. Currently, the chinese are \" near universal \" in their support of reunification of taiwan with mainland china, so \" leaders in beijing have almost nothing to gain politically from including the issue in any negotiations with the us. \" a trio of international relations experts weigh in at the guardian, with one saying trump has thus far dealt a \" punch, \" \" hug, \" and now \" uppercut \" to china.",

        "summary": "Your typical frogs lay eggs, while a few species give birth to froglets. But frogs giving birth to tadpoles is new to science — and researchers have managed to witness it, the bbc reports. A scientist at berkeley was holding what he thought was a male frog when it gave birth to a bunch of tadpoles. Now, \" in total, we have either observed tadpoles in the oviducts or direct-birth of tadpoles on 19 occasions, \" researchers write at plos one. The species in question, called a \" fanged \" frog because it fights with appendages extending from its lower jaw, was discovered in the 1990s, but only recently determined to be its own species. \" this new frog is one of only 10 or 12 species that has evolved internal fertilization, and of those, it is the only one that gives birth to tadpoles, as opposed to froglets or laying fertilized eggs, \" says jim mcguire, the researcher who held the frog as it was giving birth. Its latin name, limnonectes larvaepartus, means \" marsh swimmer that gives birth to larvae, \" reuters reports. Researchers still aren't sure how the males fertilize the eggs, given that they don't have typical penises. But frogs have \" all sorts \" of weird reproductive habits, mcguire notes, ranging from females swallowing and brooding their eggs in their stomachs to males brooding them in their vocal sacs. ( speaking of vocal sacs, another \" new \" species boasts a highly unusual croak. )",

The team led by east tennessee state university's jim mead — with assistance from workers at wind cave national park, the university of maine, and two museums, per kcsr — is already lugging out bags of sediment and bones for analysis from persistence cave. But the national park service has kept the cave under wraps since 2004 to keep amateur spelunkers away, and still won't say where the cave is located. At issue are the remains of three species never before seen in the region: the pine marten, pika, and now-extinct platygonus. The rodent-like pika, for example, still exists in north america's colder, mountainous areas, an indication that the black hills ' climate may have once been quite different. \" what has changed to push [ the pika ] into wyoming but not be in the black hills? \" says mead. They plan to compare their findings with fossils discovered at the nearby mammoth site in hot springs, sd, \" to understand essentially the ice age environmental change through time, \" says mead.

Police have identified 34-year-old maryland resident daron dylon wint as a suspect, and law enforcement sources tell the washington post that he was identified through dna found on the crust of the pizza, which investigators believe may have been delivered while savvas savopoulos, his wife amy, their 10-year-old son philip, and housekeeper veralicia figueroa were being held captive. A warrant has been issued for wint's arrest, but his whereabouts are unknown. The warrant charges wint with first-degree murder while armed. His criminal record includes charges of carrying concealed weapons and theft, nbc washington reports. Court records list a lanham, md., address for wint close to where the savopoulous family's blue porsche was found on fire in a parking lot, the ap reports. Savopoulos was the ceo of american iron works, and his assistant reportedly dropped off $ 40,000 in cash at the home hours before it went up in flames. In the hours before the fire, there were multiple phone calls between savopoulos, the assistant, an accountant, a bank, and another exec at the construction firm, according to police documents seen by the post.",

        "summary": "A female found buried near bologna, italy, in an early medieval grave got a much deeper examination thanks to the discovery of a second set of bones in the grave: those of what has been determined to be a 38-week-old fetus. Forbes picks up the study, published in the journal world neurosurgery, which comes to a grim conclusion: italian researchers believe the fetus \" extruded after the burial. \" forbes elaborates: researchers with the universities of ferrara and bologna believe the baby's leg bones likely never made it out of the pelvic cavity, but the upper torso and head likely did, meaning \" the fetus was likely partially delivered. \" the mother's remains show a forehead cut and an adjacent 5 millimeter hole, likely intentionally drilled during a primitive skull surgery. The researchers believe she may have been suffering from eclampsia — seizures brought on by preeclampsia, a pregnancy disorder whose hallmark is high blood pressure — and that the surgery was an attempt to ease \" the intracranial pressure. \" the researchers hypothesize she lived one week after surgery. Decomposition was a probable mechanism in the partial birth, with the resulting gases that swell the body ultimately pushing out the fetus. An american ob/gyn not associated with the study offers her theory: \" pressure from the gas builds up, and the dead fetus is delivered through a rupture — it basically blows a hole through the uterus into the vagina, as the vagina is much thinner than the cervix. \" science alert reports such \" coffin births \" appear only rarely in the forensic archaeological record, and are rarer still in modern times due to the pre-burial removal of bodily fluids, though there was reportedly a case of it in south africa in january.

            "A north carolina man allegedly attempted to elude police on wednesday by diving into the ocean and swimming away -- but unknowingly he was just feet away from a shark while trying the brazen escape. Zachary kingsbury, 20, was pulled over for a traffic stop just before 5 p.m. In surf city, according to wect. He allegedly tried to escape when officers spotted illegal contraband inside the vehicle and asked him to exit the car. Kingsbury jumped into the ocean and began swimming away, leading to an hours-long standoff, officials said. Within an hour, kingsbury was reportedly 4,000 feet from the shore, and the surf city police department launched a drone to track the escapee. \" at that point, the operation became a rescue operation, \" police said in a statement. But as police were trying to save kingsbury, they noticed a shark swimming near the man, drone footage showed. Police were able to nab kingsbury about 7: 45 p.m., according to the charlotte observer. \" i would've drowned after 10 minutes... Dude's an animal, \" a witness wrote in a facebook post. Kingsbury was charged with resisting arrest, obstructing an officer, possession of drug paraphernalia, methamphetamine, and possession of marijuana of up to a half an ounce."

        "summary": "Seven episodes down and three to go in this season of game of thrones, with sunday night's episode proving to be \" a well-paced, quieter \" one in the guardian's view. Quieter, yes, but studded with some big events all the same. Among the best ( and spoiler-filled ) post-episode analysis, observations, and conjectures: writing for rolling stone, sean t. Collins observes that after the pilot and season four premiere, last night's episode marks the third-ever use of the \" cold open \" in the show, slipping in a scene before the opening credits. He takes a look at why, and calls out the \" thesis statement about war and violence \" the episode succinctly provides. At the atlantic, lenika cruz parses the meaning behind the episode's title, \" the broken man, \" an episode that she writes, \" did a lot of crucial set-up in economical fashion and via plenty of elegantly written scenes. \" as matt miller puts it, \" it only took six seasons, but game of thrones finally just revealed its first lesbian major character. \" at esquire, he takes a brief look at last night's reveal. Joanna robinson calls the arya-waif encounter \" a tv fake-out death \" that strays from the norm, in that we know she isn't dead ( courtesy of next week's preview ). At vanity fair, robinson examines what purpose the scene serves — and speculates about where arya got that gold. In a separate piece, robinson looks at where the women of westeros stand, ending with cersei and the \" hint of what's to come \" that we were given — robinson lays out one line of speculation involving cersei and wildfire. Speaking of what's to come, mashable notes three big things that look set to happen in next week's seemingly \" positively action packed \" episode. Miscellaneous: it was a \" really good week for grizzled british character actors, \" one writer's geography complaint, and long live lyanna mormont.",

William west — but archaeologists have identified the remains of those four men as high-ranking leaders of jamestown, reports npr. In a sign of their importance, the four were buried in a church, the first protestant one in america, reports ap. Researchers say one of the most intriguing discoveries is a small silver box buried with archer. It's believed to be a catholic reliquary, which is odd considering the church was protestant. A post at the atlantic calls it a \" historical bombshell \" because it suggests \" researchers may have just discovered proof of an underground community of catholics — including archer and perhaps the person who buried him with the relic — who pretended to be protestants. \" it may take a while for historians to piece together the full story. Archer and the others were buried between 1608 and 1610, as the settlement battled starvation and native americans, reports the new york times. Hunt, 39, was the first anglican minister in america; archer, 34, was an expeditionary leader and a rival of john smith; wainman, 34, was a soldier in charge of ammunition and horses; and west, 24, is described as a gentleman who died in a battle with native americans. \"this is the first colony, and it's closely connected to what follows, so what takes place at jamestown in these early years is not separate from the mainline of development of american society, \" says james horn, the president of jamestown rediscovery, which is leading the dig. \"this is the beginning of american society, and religion is a very big part of that. \"",

        "summary": "Francis scott key, member of president andrew jackson's \" kitchen cabinet \" who also served as the us attorney for the district of columbia, is probably best known for penning the lyrics to the \" star spangled banner \" 200 years ago. ( he borrowed the melody from an english tune popular at the time, according to the washington post. ) but the national anthem contains a lesser-known third verse about the \" foul footsteps \" of slaves who fought for the british, and it betrays another side to a complicated man — a side that is explored in a new book. On the one hand, key offered free legal help to some slaves fighting for their freedom; on the other, he sometimes represented slave owners trying to take back their slaves. Key himself owned slaves and appears to have believed that doing so \" was the white man's constitutional right, \" says one expert. He likely helped spark a race riot in 1835 by aggressively prosecuting a black man accused of attempted murder, but he also defended the suspect from a lynch mob. \" the kind of slave trafficking where the masters beat the hell out of black people did offend his humanitarian principles as a white liberal, \" that historian tells the baltimore sun. \" but his solution wasn't to abolish slavery. It was to ask the slave masters to be nicer. \" key also co-founded the american colonization society, which sent free blacks to africa to establish what would one day become liberia. More on these revelations is laid out in the first biography of key written in more than 75 years — what so proudly we hailed by marc leepson — and the first to confront what leepson calls key's \" cloudy \" legacy on slavery, which the author points out was more common than not at the time. Key believed blacks were inferior to whites in important ways, but, the author points out, so did abraham lincoln.

The second escapee, 32-year-old chrishan beasley ( the bbc reports his name as christian beasley ), evaded detection for nearly a week, but was finally caught saturday on the island of lombok, about 100 miles away from bali's kerobokan prison, where he'd been imprisoned since an august drug charge, the new york times reports. \" we got him around 9: 30pm … in a street outside of a [ budget hotel ], \" the local police chief says. Prison officials believe he escaped in the early hours of dec. 11 by sawing through the steel bars over his cell, using a rope to descend one wall, then using a ladder left by a construction crew to climb over another wall on his escape route, the ap reports. The washington post notes the poor state of many indonesian prisons, plagued by overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, staffing issues, drugs, and violence. Kerobokan, which is designed to hold 300 or so inmates, has at least 1,400. Because of the country's strict drug laws, prisons there are filled with drug offenders — beasley was in kerobokan after being found at a bali post office, allegedly with 5.7 grams of hash. Many prisoners decide it's better to attempt an escape than endure another day behind bars, leading to routine jailbreaks. \" i've seen people get murdered in there. I've seen people get bashed. I've seen drug overdoses. One guy died in my arms from sickness, \" a former kerobokan prisoner from new zealand notes.

Their top three, in order: security, knowledge, and religion. Last year, psychologist sandie mchugh also asked bolton residents, via the news, to fill out a questionnaire that mirrored the one used in 1938. Some 76 years later, things have certainly changed, at least according to the 489 people the news reports responded to the survey: religion now occupies the 10th slot. While security holds on to a place in the top 3, it is joined by leisure and good humor, which the survey defined as \" more smiling and laughter for myself and those around me. \" mchugh observes that \" the overall impression from the correspondence in 1938 is that happiness factors were rooted in everyday lives at home and within the community, \" and that, too, has changed: while a majority once reported being happiest in their town, 63 % of 2014 respondents said they were happier away from bolton.

Three witnesses related to the victim say jonathan sanders was riding a horse-drawn buggy in stonewall when he made a comment to officer kevin herrington, who had pulled over a driver. He said something like, \" why don't you leave that man alone? \" the lawyer tells the guardian. The driver who was pulled over says he then heard herrington say, \" i ' m going to get that n*****, \" before confronting an unarmed sanders. Police say there was \" a fight, \" while witnesses say sanders was choked with a head-mounted light he'd been wearing and twice uttered, \" i can't breathe. \" a witness offered to perform cpr, but herrington reportedly refused. Medical examiners have ruled sanders'death a homicide by asphyxiation. \" we believe there is probable cause for a prosecution, \" says the lawyer. Meanwhile a second death in police custody in texas has family and friends demanding justice. Sandra bland, 28 — a civil rights activist, per nbc news — was arrested for assault during a traffic stop last friday and booked at waller county jail. Officials say they spoke with bland at 8am monday — the day she was to be released on $ 5,000 bond — but returned to find her dead in her cell.

In a major setback for afghan forces, who abandoned a provincial headquarters for the first time since 2001, the insurgents raised their white banner over the central square and freed hundreds of fellow militants from the local jail. The stunning assault came a day before president ashraf ghani's unity government marks its first anniversary, and will further complicate efforts to resume stalled peace negotiations.",
            "Kabul, afghanistan — after months of besieging the northern afghan provincial capital of kunduz, taliban fighters took over the city on monday just hours after advancing, officials said, as government security forces fully retreated to the city's outlying airport. The taliban's sudden victory, after what had appeared to be a stalemate through the summer, gave the insurgents a military and political prize — the capture of a major afghan city — that had eluded them since 2001. And it presented the government of president ashraf ghani, which has been alarmed about insurgent advances in the surrounding province for a year, with a demoralizing setback less than a year after the formal end",

It is the most serious invasion of a provincial capital in 14 years. The taliban entered the city during an early morning assault on monday, storming the regional hospital and clashing with security forces at the nearby university.

        "summary": "Kenneth wanamaker jr.'s 6-year-old daughter's teeth were so infected last year that, police and a dentist say, her life was in danger. According to the dentist, who called it \" frightening \" and testified that it was \" the worst case of dental disease \" he'd ever seen, 16 of her 20 teeth either needed to be pulled, were abscessed, or were badly decayed in the root or the tooth after county caseworkers finally got involved. Wanamaker was charged and was set to go to trial soon, but last month, the 37-year-old pennsylvania man pleaded guilty to recklessly endangering another person and false swearing and was sentenced to jail time and probation. But in a motion filed april 22, he claims he didn't understand the charges, and on saturday, he said he didn't put his daughter at risk and that he will ask a judge this week to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea, the morning call reports. \" i never endangered my child's life, \" wanamaker said. \" i never neglected care for my child. That's not me. \" he says new evidence backs him up, showing that his daughter's tooth decay was not that bad. His april 22 motion also claims he was not given the right to effective assistance of counsel, because his lawyer didn't have enough time to get evidence and witnesses together. As the morning call reported last year, wanamaker's partner, jessica hoffman, is also implicated in her daughter's ill health. The district attorney's office is also looking into the 2011 death of their 7-month-old son from pneumonia, and last year, there were also investigations into two stillborn babies born to the couple. When the second of those stillborn births occurred in december 2013, hoffman tested positive for meth use, which led to her and wanamaker being probed and ultimately charged in the dental neglect case; they were accused of ignoring caseworkers'requests to get their daughter care because they did not want to spend the money.",

Proponents of continued certification, including defense secretary james mattis, say iran has so far been \" technically \" adhering to its end of the bargain and that pulling out now could erode international trust and cause iran to go back to building up its program with full force. Critics, however, say they fear iran could secretly flout the deal, and that due to a \" sunset provision \" will go back to openly building up its nukes after a decade has passed anyway.

Under a new policy, overweight pilots and controllers must get checked out for a condition known as obstructive sleep apnea, reports usa today. The worry is that if they get lousy sleep at night, they won't be as sharp while at work or, worse, might even fall asleep on the job. The agency will start with pilots with a bmi of 40, and fox news offers a ballpark: that would apply to a 6-foot man who weighs about 300 pounds. Once all the 40-bmis are checked, the faa will start looking at those with bmis of 30. Cnn estimates that the order will apply to about 125,000 commercial and private pilots.

The graduates specifically accuse the law school of committing fraud and negligence and of violating multiple state statutes, alleging among other things that it fudged numbers on those who had found work in the legal field. Now san diego superior court judge joel pressman has found for the plaintiffs on every cause of action in setting a trial date. He specifically noted the school's use of employment stats: \" a reasonable consumer expects the employment figure to include graduates who work in law-related jobs, \" he wrote. If found guilty, quartz sees a potential lesson: \" never try and swindle people who have just spent the last three years of their lives meticulously learning how to spot deceit. \"",

This appears to be the most disreputable thing we've seen in a serious industry award tabulation since the time when the hollywood foreign press association got wined and dined and all but bribed by zillionaire meshulem riklis to nominate his fetching wife zadora for best new star of the year award. She won the bauble for the much reviled pic butterfly, after riklis flew the voters to his las vegas casino and cast such a spell that they considered zadora a new star even though her resume went back 17 years to her child-acting turn starring in"

Canada's georgie knox says she was on her way to her job in calgary early one morning when a coyote ran out in front of her car, kxtv reports. \" i heard a crunch, \" she writes in a sept. 9 facebook post, and because she thought the coyote hadn't survived, she continued on her way. It was only when she got closer to work, while stopped at a traffic light, that a construction worker flagged her down and \" notified me that there was in fact a coyote still embedded in my car, \" knox writes. Sure enough, the coyote she'd hit back in airdrie was caught in the grille, just \" looking up and blinking at me. \" knox got alberta's fish and wildlife agency to free the coyote, which suffered only \" minimal injuries, \" per knox. It was given the thumbs-up and released back into the wild. The daily hive notes it's about 20 miles between airdrie and calgary, which is what really has knox stunned at the critter's survival at \" highway speeds. \" \" clearly mother nature has other plans for this special little guy, \" knox says in her post. Some commenters point out the coyote shouldn't have had to endure the ride in the first place. \" a decent human being would park on the side of the road and check if he actually killed the coyote, \" one noted on knox's post. \" if dead, [ she ] should have buried him/her or at the very least moved him/her off the road. \" ( was the coyote on'shrooms? )",

The new larger ipad — likely to be called the ipad pro — will have a 12.9-inch screen, storage between 64 gigabytes and 128 gigabytes, four speakers, and the ability to run two apps simultaneously next to each other, international business times reports. According to 9 to 5 mac, there will also be a stylus and keyboard sold separately. The giant ipad is likely to be closer in cost to a macbook than other ipads, the times reports. Cnn reports ipad sales have been dropping for 18 months — possibly due to smartphone screens getting larger — and the rumored ipad pro could be an attempt to compete with the microsoft surface and get apple products into more corporate offices. Less than one-third of corporations use macs in their offices, and apple has already made moves to change that, such as partnering with ibm and cisco and adding new capabilities to its operating system. A larger ipad could be part of that effort. \" if used with a stylus, such a device could be a powerful tool for business, \" cnn reports.

Greg giannonatti's girlfriend tells the washington post it wasn't such a surprise because greg's father collected gold and coins. The bigger shock came later: the pair vanished just nine days after beverly picked up the gold bar on oct. 19. Beverly was seen having lunch with an unknown white man, thought to be in this 50s or 60s, on oct. 28. That night, greg was seen speeding away from his home, per the montana standard. His car was later found at his late father's house. On sunday, their bodies were discovered on a private dump site in powell county along with evidence from an undisclosed crime scene, per the standard. A second site held evidence of their murders, police say. Cops haven't said how or when the pair died, but authorities found no sign of a struggle at beverly and greg's homes on nov. 1. Both were locked and their dogs were there. A \" hockey puck \" of a pot roast was found in a slow cooker at greg's and the tv was on, reports nbc montana and the standard. On nov. 2, police found greg's door open with a tv and clothing outside and suspect a burglary was interrupted; they haven't said if the incident is tied to the murders. The standard reports police questioned david wayne nelson, a 53-year-old white man previously convicted of robbery and kidnapping on monday and say he is a \" high person of interest. \" he was jailed without bail on monday on a probation violation charge.

Now one researcher says he has the answer: an asteroid believed to be about six miles wide that landed in the caribbean about 66 million years ago. The chicxulub impact was first floated as a theory in 1980, but as a princeton professor explains to npr, \" if [ the impact ] is the cause, it had to be precisely at the time of the mass extinction. It can't be before and it can't be afterwards. \" and as livescience notes, previous research suggested the asteroid hit 300,000 years before or 180,000 years after the mass extinction event. Now, a researcher says the asteroid and die-off happened \" within a gnat's eyebrow \" of each other, reports the afp. Paul renne, a university of california geologist, performed high-precision radiometric dating on ash deposited above fossils buried in montana and on glass blobs found around the chicxulub crater to determine the age of the events. \" and lo and behold they are exactly the same, \" renne says. The analyzed ash suggests the mass die-off occurred about 66,043,000 years ago, while the asteroid hit approximately 66,038,000 years ago. \" considering the statistical errors, \" the two events \" may have occurred no more than 32,000 years apart, \" reports science, where the study was published. \" when i got started in the field, the error bars on these events were plus or minus a million years, \" marvels one scientist.

Bardi also explores her own time on the region's \" hash trail \" ( also known as a \" hippie haven \" ), which has claimed the disturbing disappearances of more than 20 foreigners in the area since 1998, most of them mysteries that haven't been solved and which have led to a more menacing-sounding nickname: the valley of death. Bardi traveled to the village of kheerganga to document some of shetler's baba's history ( with drastically different stories emerging ), as well as the area's heavy drug use that's blamed for its \" seedier elements. \" she finds the region seems to draw people \" on an incomprehensible, solitary quest, \" a magnet for supposedly \" thousands \" of nomads who choose to live \" with little more than basic necessities in a vast, harsh land. \" as for shetler, the baba who led him on the trek was detained by cops — but he killed himself in his jail cell. Meanwhile, shetler's family reveals on a gofundme page set up to raise money to find him that his motorcycle and some personal items were found, but he never turned up; he was last spotted on sept. 3. \" we thank you from the bottom of our hearts, and pray that justin is returned to us safely, \" the page reads. More on the mystery here. ( an american woman and her canadian husband were kidnapped by the taliban while backpacking in afghanistan. )",

            "Two canadian activists are among a group of 25 people who were being held at gunpoint aboard a greenpeace ship, the environmental group said thursday. Arctic campaign co-ordinator christy ferguson said paul ruzycki of port colborne, ont., and a man from montreal whose name was not released were arrested when russian coast guard officers boarded their vessel, which greenpeace says was in international waters. Ferguson said at least 15 members of the coast guard used helicopters and ropes to rappel on board the arctic sunrise, a greenpeace ship carrying a crew bent on protesting offshore oil drilling in the arctic. The crew were being held in the ship's mess, she said, adding no injuries have been reported. This was a peaceful protest against reckless industrial activity. - christy ferguson, greenpeace's arctic campaign co-ordinator the incident took place thursday as the ship was circling an oil platform in the pechora sea, an arm of the barents sea.

Instead, animal behaviorists who have watched what happened at a wharf in british columbia say the girl's family put her at risk with their \" reckless \" actions, reports the cbc. \" you wouldn't go up to a grizzly bear in the bush and hand him a ham sandwich, so you shouldn't be handing a thousand-pound wild mammal in the water slices of bread, \" says robert kiesman of the steveston harbour authority. He notes that just moments before grabbing the girl, the sea lion had popped up out of the water looking agitated, and yet nobody stopped the girl from sitting on the edge of the dock. \" totally reckless, \" says kiesman. The family may not have been aware of it, but the sea lion had given what a trainer at the vancouver aquarium calls \" an aggressive precursor, \" per the vancouver sun. \"you saw him kind of initially lunge out of the water and give a little huff, \" says danielle hyson. He seemed irked because the scraps had stopped coming, and people should have immediately backed off. An unidentified man believed to be a family member jumped in and rescued the girl, but animal experts say she needs to get to the hospital quickly if the animal broke the skin even slightly. She would need specific antibiotics thanks to \" some pretty nasty bacteria \" in the sea lion's mouth, says hyson. Meanwhile, harbor officials are posting more signs and adding patrols to warn people that it's illegal to feed marine mammals.",

The allegations include improperly handled sex scenes, the separation of writers by race, and a generally troubled set. However, show producer abc studios investigated and found no wrongdoing on the part of shaw, reports variety. The issues with the intimate scenes involve actress samara weaving, in seasons one and two. In the first season, weaving, who has a no-nudity clause, balked at performing nude, prompting shaw to pull up her own shirt to show her it was no big deal, per the hollywood reporter. In the second season, shaw wore underwear in an intimate scene with a nude male actor; both had complained about the scene beforehand, and while it was supposed to be a closed set, shaw reportedly turned on monitors during the shoot. Weaving was later released from the show at her request. Says the 37-year-old shaw: \" i sincerely hope we can work together to resolve any and all issues, as i am committed to creating a workplace in which all people feel safe and heard, \" she says.

President trump sees it as a watergate-level scandal involving hillary clinton, while those who disagree — now notably including shepard smith of fox news — think trump and republicans are wildly distorting the facts. The controversy came up again tuesday when gop lawmakers pressed attorney general jeff sessions on why he hasn't appointed a special prosecutor to investigate. A \" factual basis \" is required, he responded, suggesting it does not currently exist. Some background and developments: uranium one: it's a mining company headquartered in canada that's one of the world's biggest producers of uranium and owns mining rights in the us. In 2010, the russian state nuclear agency, rosatom, bought a controlling interest. At the time, this involved an estimated 20 % of us uranium, though the figure is now about 10 %, per the christian science monitor. The accusation: trump and clinton's critics say that key players in the deal gave $ 145 million to the clinton foundation, and that she then approved rosatom's purchase of the canadian company as secretary of state. Trump has called it \" the biggest story that fake media doesn't want to follow, \" and sean hannity has been pushing it hard on fox news. The pushback: on tuesday, hannity's fox counterpart, shep smith, departed from the network's coverage of the story, calling trump's accusations \" inaccurate. \" for one thing, the sale was approved by the heads of nine departments, state being one of them, and it's not clear clinton played any role. \" the clinton state department had no power to veto or approve that transaction, \" says smith.

        "summary": "It's taken nearly 140 years of building and two recent years of talks, but it looks like barcelona's most-visited tourist attraction, the unfinished sagrada familia, may finally see its finishing touches put on. The guardian and new york times report a $ 41 million, 10-year deal has been struck between trustees for the famous roman catholic church and the city council so that the structure — whose name means \" holy family, \" per reuters — can get the licensing paperwork from the city, which it's never had, that it needs to be completed. The money paid out to the city, which people notes is the amount accrued over all these years in fees from lacking the proper permits, will help fund improvements to transportation services there. Work began on the massive church in 1882, and the times explains that a building permit was acquired in the town it was then located in: sant marti de provencals. But that town was eventually absorbed into barcelona, and city authorities there apparently never issued a new permit. To complicate things, antoni gaudi, the catalan architect behind the building's design, died in 1926 after being hit by a tram, with only about 25 % of the structure complete. Officials hope that with all the red tape about to be moved out of the way, the structure, which is about two-thirds done, could be finished by 2026, the century anniversary of gaudi's death. ( not quite a landmark, but this unfinished us nuclear power plant went up for sale for $ 36.4 million in 2016. )",

Hughes smith's family says she told them friday night, via a strange phone call, that she had to leave town for a few days and was already on the road; the call ended abruptly. On saturday, police found the family's crashed car, upside down and on fire, but with no one inside, wjtv reports. The bodies were found about a mile from where the car crashed; someone had apparently set it on fire, kltv notes.

Palmer amaranth, or pigweed — which the minneapolis star tribune notes is \" one of the most prolific and devastating weeds in the country for corn, soybeans and other row crops \" — is typically found in the american southwest but has been spreading to outside areas in recent years. Government programs like the conservation reserve program meant to benefit bee and other wildlife habitats have inadvertently helped the spread: officials say native seed mixes planted by farmers on conservation land were contaminated with pigweed seed. It's not yet clear who is at fault — a scientist notes seed companies likely had no idea their mixes were contaminated — but in minnesota, for example, the mistake has allowed pigweed to spread into two counties for the first time. All 13 affected landowners received seed mix from the same company, which hasn't been named. The annual weed — which grows so thick a scientist says it's \" almost chain saw material \" — has also spread to 49 counties in iowa, up from five at the start of the year. The farmers there purchased seeds from areas like kansas and texas, where pigweed is found. Crews have been torching the weeds to prevent seeds from falling next spring — a single plant can produce 1 million, per the high plains journal — but eradicating the weeds entirely could take years.

            "Federal programs designed to help farmers set aside more habitat for bees and wildlife have produced a dangerous offshoot this year: some mixes used to plant native grasses and flowers were contaminated with harmful weed seeds that have now been introduced onto hundreds of farms in several midwestern states, including minnesota. The weeds include palmer amaranth, one of the most prolific and devastating weeds in the country for corn, soybeans and other row crops. It has been a scourge for cotton and soybean farmers in the south and has slowly but steadily started to move north into the nation's corn belt. The inadvertent planting of weed seeds on conservation land has greatly accelerated their spread, leading to the discovery of palmer in minnesota for the first time. \"it's probably the most significant agronomic weed that we've seen over the last 30 years, \" said tony cortilet, noxious weed program coordinator for the minnesota department of agriculture. A farmer in yellow medicine county in western minnesota reported palmer amaranth in his newly planted conservation land in september.

Now cassandra is in the middle of a legal battle headed this week for the state supreme court. At issue is whether the decision is hers to make: she's been taken from her mother ( who says she supports but isn't swaying her daughter's decision ) and placed in the temporary custody of the state, which has forced her to undergo chemo for the past three weeks, reports abc news. The department of children and families said it was obligated to act when \" several physicians involved in this case tell us with certainty that a child will die as a result of leaving a decision up to a parent. \" cassandra's lawyer argues that the issue isn't whether the girl's life is at risk — doctors say the prognosis is bad without treatment and that she ' ll have an 80 % to 85 % chance of surviving with chemo — but rather whether she should be considered a \" mature minor \" and allowed to reject medical treatment, reports the hartford courant. \" this is an untested legal area in connecticut and there is not much guidance, \" her attorney says. \" can a smart and knowledgeable 17-year-old make the same choice, for better or worse, than she would be able to make without state interference nine months from now, when she turns 18? \" in 2013, 17 states — excluding connecticut — had a mature-minor doctrine, with illinois and massachusetts allowing for refusal of treatment.

A judge declared that stephen coffeen \" did not understand the wrongfulness of his actions \" and found him not guilty by reason of insanity today, reports the st. Petersburg times. What normally would have been a local case drew national attention when an expert noted in court that coffeen had been guzzling red bull before the killing, notes abc. The \" red bull defense \" became an instant headline hit. \" this case is not and never has been about red bull, \" said the judge. Four experts who testified at the non-jury hearing agreed that the 41-year-old could not differentiate right from wrong. Coffeen's brother is upset with the verdict, saying coffeen intended to kill their father all along. \" he got away with murder, \" he says. \" let 12 floridians make the decision, not four ' experts.

Petersburg and therefore is not guilty by reason of insanity. It was dubbed the \" red bull defense \" case because one expert mentioned in a court hearing that stephen coffeen, 41, suffered from sleep deprivation and had been drinking a lot of the red bull energy drink. But \" this case is not and never has been about red bull, \" pinellas-pasco circuit judge nancy moate ley said. Four experts examined coffeen's mental state and concluded, with unanimity, that he was unable to understand his actions at the time of the killing, the judge said. Therefore, she said the law required her to accept the prosecutors ' and defense attorneys ' agreement that coffeen is not guilty by reason of insanity and should be committed to a state hospital under the auspices of the state department of children and families. Assistant state attorney kendall davidson has said red bull had no significant impact in the evaluations. Ley will hear a report on coffeen's mental state on dec. 14.
