The hourly \" pings \" are typically used to \" synchronize timing information, \" the telegraph reports. Then inmarsat used the doppler effect to figure out how fast the plane was going relative to the satellite — a technique that has \" never been done before, \" an inmarsat vp says. Reuters explains that the doppler effect is the reason \" the sound of a police car siren changes as it approaches and then overtakes an observer. \" the company determined two possible flight path arcs. \" the arcs were based on time shift — how long the ping took to reach the satellite — which gave a distance and thus an arc, \" an expert explains. \" by looking at speed — and comparing to other planes at the same distance from the satellite — it was possible to determine the plane was not in the northern hemisphere and pin down the track with a high probability, \" concluding that the plane took the southern route. As for figuring out where exactly it went down, the vp explains that the company knew where the last ping came from, and that the plane must have run out of fuel before the next ping would have gone out, which helped it to narrow down the search area — but there's still a lot of uncertainty related to how fast the plane was going at the time and whether it \" plunged or glided. \" the focus of the search, meanwhile, has turned to the black boxes.",

The task force determined that data on billions of phone records should still be gathered, but will likely call for: a legal team that would argue against the nsa's lawyers before the fisa court, sort of like public defenders keeping phone records in the hands of phone companies or a third party, rather than in nsa databases, and imposing more strict standards on when and how the nsa could search them publicly announcing safeguards to protect the privacy of foreign citizens the nsa is monitoring direct presidential review of which foreign leaders are being spied on regular white house reviews of the agency's surveillance activities, much like those the president already conducts each year on the cia's work splitting the nsa off from the military's cyber command, and putting a civilian leader at the helm. The recommendations will be considered alongside a separate review from security officials. \" there's going to be a lot of pushback to some of their ideas, \" says one source. In particular, expect objections from intelligence officials. On capitol hill wednesday, nsa director keith alexander argued that the programs already had plenty of oversight. \" we can't go back to a pre-9/11 moment, \" he said, according to the washington post.

And the man of steel's climactic feat in the 1978 film superman — flying around earth so fast that the planet reversed spin, reviving a dead lois lane — is partly possible but highly dangerous. Scientifically, superman could fly fast enough to alter the earth's spin, but time wouldn't go backward and the gravitational field he created would attract enough asteroids to destroy life on earth. Among other findings: santa's near-light-speed travels ( to hand out all gifts in 12 hours ) would make him 242 seconds younger than us humans, and the flash's feet could catch fire on his tv show the flash if he ran at 15,459 miles an hour.

        "summary": "\" mansplain \" — the act of a man explaining something to someone, typically a woman, \" in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing \" — has been a part of our vernacular for a few years now. But writing for slate, katy waldman says \" -splain \" itself has since become \" squishy, \" specifically because it's lost the preciseness that made it so effective in the first place. \" this suffix, once so useful, has fallen into a tar pit of sophistry and nonsense, \" she says. For example, although the term \" mansplain \" itself used to be a specific way to express the complexity of gender dynamics, it's now been diluted to describe any condescending explainer between any two people ( even between two men ) or even simply to illustrate a point made by a man that isn't inherently patronizing but something someone just doesn't agree with. And the suffix itself has \"'sploded in its own right, \" she adds, becoming generic enough that it's being used to simply, well, explain how someone or something explains something else ( see how i just jenn-splained that to you ). Not exactly the \" marriage of … irony and information asymmetry \" that leads to conversation failure — one party thinking they're correcting a gap in knowledge when it's the other way around — as waldman contends \"'splain \" should be used. Instead of keeping the \" focusing of hostility \" on the explainer, the suffix is increasingly being used to apply to the thing being explained ( e.g., \" ' beersplaining ' jokes [ that ] lampoon the snobbery around obscure craft brews \" ). \" the trope has steadily hemorrhaged meaning, \" waldman writes. \" then it was a crude rhetorical strategy. Now it's just a lazy joke. \" her full take.",

The skeleton was uncovered three years ago by a bulldozer excavating a parking lot near the famous battle site near brussels. Alongside the skeleton were 20 french and german coins ( about a month's salary ) and a piece of wood with initials that looked like \" cb. \" researchers pegged him as a twenty-something private, but couldn't identify the man until they spotted a barely legible \" f \" preceding the \" cb. \" glover then looked up names of soldiers who died in the battle ( where tens of thousands perished ) and found three germans with \" cfb \" initials. One fought elsewhere on the battlefield and one survived, leaving only brandt. No dna test could be performed because brandt has no surviving blood relatives, inquisitr reports.

Peter willoughby of hampshire county, england, cleaned bird droppings at a ford factory for 25 years and let a friend store pigeons in his garden, the daily echo reports. But willoughby's family struggled to connect the dots between his bird contact and fatal illness, which killed him last summer at age 72. \" he wasn't into pigeons, \" says his wife, teresa. \" he didn't mind watching them from a distance. If he did go anywhere near them he put a mask on. \" yet an inquest found that the bird allergy ( or \" pigeon fancier's lung \" ) had scarred his lungs and triggered pneumonia. Experts said that his job at ford was to clean windscreens heavily coated with pigeon droppings. And at home, \" he was also exposed to feathers and excreta when he was close to the pigeon loft, \" says the senior coroner. \" i think it was a combination of those two factors. \" the family found it \" heart-wrenching to see somebody so independent go downhill like that, \" says teresa, adding that the roughly year-long illness \" must have been hell for him but he never complained. \" the pigeon allergy afflicts up to 22 % of the world's pigeon fanciers with a range of symptoms from exhaustion to weight loss, but isn't usually fatal, according to british pigeon fanciers medical research. Pigeons are threatened by disease, too: hundreds of the birds are dying in the san francisco bay area, possibly from illness related to drought, cbs san francisco reports. ( in fact, thousands of dead birds are washing up on the west coast. )",

Peter willoughby allowed a friend to keep pigeons at the bottom of his garden and spent more than 25 years cleaning bird mess off windscreens at ford. But the 72-year-old did not know that an allergy to the birds was slowly killing him. It was not until years later that he found out that an allergy to the pigeons was scarring his lungs. Peter willoughby with his great granddaughter emily. Winchester coroner's court heard how the 72-year-old's frequent contact with the birds both at home and at work over such a long period caused permanent damaged to his lungs – commonly known as pigeon fancier's lung – which ultimately killed him. The hearing was told that peter had built a pigeon loft where his friend and business partner, pigeon fancier gary vear, could keep his birds at the back of the totton newsagents which they owned from 1989. When peter and his wife teresa left test news in 2007, the pigeons moved with them to the bottom of their 100ft garden in shepherd's hey road and later to their bungalow at calmore gardens. But while the birds lived in his garden, peter rarely went near them, leaving their care to gary.

Allyson carroll, a dendrochronologist ( aka tree-ring expert ) at humboldt state university, discovered the discrepancy when she compared tree 76's rings to those of its relatives around other parts of california. Carroll also pinpointed the ages of two fallen redwoods in the forest at 693 years old and a youthful 536, lending credence to the theory that muir woods is relatively young compared to the redwoods and sequoias further north: a coastal redwood cited by both the times and the chronicle is a mature 2,520 years old. So why is the famous forest so much younger than its cousins? carroll notes that natural events like landslides or fires may have wiped out older trees somewhere down the timeline, per the chronicle.

The question was brought before parliament by an official who was concerned that if a driving student offered sex as payment, that amounted to prostitution. And while prostitution is legal in the netherlands, in this case it wouldn't be properly taxed. Solution? two ministers found it isn't prostitution as long as the instructor is the one making the offer. \" it is important that the initiative lies with the driving instructor and focuses on offering a driving lesson, with the payment provided in sexual acts, \" they wrote in a letter to parliament. But there are some rules when it comes to what is being called \" ride for a ride, \" the telegraph reports. First, both driving instructor and driving student most be over 18. And the independent adds the sex must be done in a way that is both safe for the participants and the public.

The total numbers of more than 4,000 mammal, bird, fish, reptile and amphibian species declined rapidly between 1970 and 2014, the living planet report 2018 says. Current rates of species extinction are now up to 1,000 times higher than before human involvement in animal ecosystems became a factor. The proportion of the planet's land that is free from human impact is projected to drop from a quarter to a tenth by 2050, as habitat removal, hunting, pollution, disease and climate change continue to spread, the organization added. The group has called for an international treaty, modeled on the paris climate agreement,",

Fans from as far away as arizona snapped up the oils, watercolours and pastels of landscapes and street scenes from around his home in holt, norfolk. Kieron, dubbed mini monet, began painting two years ago. Explaining his love of local landscapes he said: \" i like them because they've got big norfolk skies and not too many hills or mountains. \"",
            "A child's art is often displayed prominently on the family fridge, but one english boy has far surpassed that standard, recently exhibiting and selling his collection of paintings for more than $ 200,000. Seven-year-old kieron williamson of norfolk, u.k., known in the british media as \" mini monet, \" has impressionist style and impressive impact: all 33 works in his latest collection sold in 27 minutes, earning $ 236,850. People from as far away as south africa, arizona and new jersey showed up at the picturecraft art gallery to purchase the prodigy's prized work. Many camped outside the gallery for two days awaiting the 9 o ' clock sale, gallery owner adrian hill said. \" kieron is painting so far in advance of his own years, \" hill said. \" there are many talented artists out there, but i can't think of one that's made such an impact at such a young age. \" hill, who has known the williamson family since before kieron was born, said kieron has always been fascinated by art. As a small child, he would walk around the gallery and closely examine all of the works each time he visited, hill said. Now, there is a wait list of 700 people who want an original kieron work.

Was 30 years old in 1983 when he was released from a michigan prison after serving time for nearly killing his boyfriend. According to reuters, he started dating 25-year-old barbara gerber, who had worked in the kitchen of a jail where gentry was an inmate. Unbeknownst to gerber, gentry also started dating 52-year-old william veith in neighboring ohio. Then gerber was found with her throat slit. Six days later, authorities found veith dead after he was beaten over the head with an ax handle. They suspect gentry killed his lovers after they found out about each other. Authorities tracked gentry to indiana but lost the trail. He sent two postcards from san diego and los angeles, and that was the last authorities heard of him. A nationwide arrest warrant was issued for him in 1988 to no effect, cbs detroit reports. Jeff smith, the michigan investigator working the cold case, says information received in the past five years hints that gentry may have adopted his middle name kelly and started hanging around west hollywood dressed as a woman. He may also be dead. Smith says gentry's fingerprints haven't popped up anywhere, and it would be unusual for him to live within the law for so long.

Cnbc reports more than 80,000 websites — including amazon, facebook, google, netflix, reddit, airbnb, and twitter — are taking part in a \" day of action \" to oppose the fcc's plan to weaken net neutrality protections. The fcc voted in may to reverse 2015 regulations that prevent comcast, at&t, and other internet service providers from blocking certain websites or slowing down or speeding up specific content. While the fcc argues regulation hurts innovation, the organizers of the protest — which includes messages on participating websites — accuse the fcc of caving to \" lobbyists from telecom companies in pursuit of more power. \" here's what else you need to know: first, here's the official protest page, which lets visitors send a message to the fcc. The pittsburgh post-gazette has a summary of the battle between isps, which claim to also want a \" free and open internet, \" and supporters of net neutrality. Speaking of which, at&t has actually joined the day of action despite being one of those isps actively lobbying against regulation. Protest co-organizers give huffpost 10 ways isps can actually support net neutrality, starting with \" stop lying. \" republican sen. John thune, writing in recode, says bipartisan legislation is the key to long-lasting net neutrality. He accuses silicon valley of prizing \" slogans over solutions. \" in a piece bluntly titled \" the internet is f --- ed ( again ), \" the verge explains why the 2015 net neutrality regulations are needed — starting with the fact that isps like comcast and spectrum are some of the least popular companies in the world and yet consumers have no choice but to pay them for internet access: \" the lack of competition in the internet access market [ lets ] these companies act like predatory monopolies. \" but the chairman of business in the public interest writes for the hill that isps have already shown they will comply with the tenets of net neutrality voluntarily — \" albeit grudgingly \" — and therefore it's a mistake to try to regulate the internet like landline telephones. Democratic sen. Ron wyden tells wired he believes isps are only paying lip service to net neutrality to avoid public backlash. Net neutrality is popular across the political spectrum, with a recent poll finding 76 % of americans support the current regulations.",

The volcano that's been erupting almost continuously for 35 years, forcing thousands from their homes this spring and summer, has produced no surface lava on the big island, including at its summit and vents, in the past three months, reports cnn, quoting the lead scientist of the us geological survey's hawaiian volcano observatory. \" at its simplest, it just means there is not enough pressure in the system to push magma up and out, \" says tina neal. There's \" a lot of room in the volcano to refill before it erupts again. \" per cnn, there has never been such a lengthy pause in kilauea's streak of 60 eruption episodes since january 1983.

Smith's husband, keith, rushed her to the emergency room, but she died hours later, the baltimore sun reports. Police are still searching for the suspects, who made off with smith's pocketbook and necklace.

        "summary": "The way britain's election backfired disastrously on prime minister theresa may is grabbing most of the attention, but the telegraph takes note of a milestone getting lost in the shuffle: a record number of women were elected to parliament. For the first time, more than 200 female mps will be in the 650-member house of commons, with the bbc putting the final tally at 207. That eclipses the previous high of 196 in 2015. Here's a look at related election coverage: historical date: the washington post notes that the vote took place on june 8, a date that carries resonance on the subject of women and voting. On the same day in 1913, suffragette emily wilding davison was fatally trampled by the king's horse at a derby, with her supporters saying she deliberately sacrificed herself to protest women's inability to vote. Hashtags remembering her were popular on twitter thursday, paired with remember-to-vote themes. More firsts: among the women elected was the first female sikh mp, preet kaur gill. Parliament also will get its first turban-wearing sikh in tanmanjeet singh dhesi, notes the hindustan times. Softer brexit? may was pushing for an aggressive schedule in regard to britain leaving the european union. The election results, however, raise the odds of a \" soft brexit \" instead, per reuters. Much is uncertain, however, and talks between the eu and britain scheduled for june 19 may be delayed. Trouble for trump? at new york, andrew sullivan notes that may and president trump were on rising trajectories not too long ago and wonders if her trouble, linked to apparent second thoughts among brits about the wisdom of brexit, might forecast the same for him in the not-too-distant future. Two parties: among the five takeaways of the election noted by politico is that britain is essentially back to a two-party system: conservatives vs. Labour. Lord buckethead: yes, it was a bad night for may, but at least she fended off a challenger in her home district who goes by the name of lord buckethead. The photos alone are priceless: see the guardian. ( the good lord did get 249 votes, however. )",

He's a shiba inu. And, as we told you about last week, he recently ate half his owner's foot. Now, for some reason, the owner, james little, no longer wants the dog. Seattle weekly talked with saving grace pet adoption center director wendy kang, who said the rambunctious pup isn't quite available yet, since he has to remain quarantined for 10 days after eating human flesh. But by this time next week, he could be munching the toes off all your gangrenous friends. Kang has nothing but the most glowing endorsements for little cosmo. \" [ he ] is a bit aloof, but overall he's a friendly dog, i suppose, \" she says.

Says shelly, \" i am not sure what she found to get a finger hold to stop herself in the slide. \" the teen found herself stuck on the cliff edge with her feet slipping, and called her dad, who alerted her employer ( she's working as a housekeeper at denali princess wilderness lodge ), who then contacted troopers.

He also thinks his father killed his fourth wife, and said so on a lifetime show in january and again to the chicago tribune this month. \" i don't want to come out and say he did it... But, i ' m sure he did it, \" stephen now says. Since his father's conviction in 2012 for the 2004 killing of kathleen savio, his third wife, stephen has lived in his father's home and raised his dad's kids. He has his suspicions about the 2007 disappearance of stacy peterson, in which his father remains a suspect. Stephen says that at first he believed his dad's stories that savio drowned accidentally and that stacy left him for another man — even though, stephen says, the day after stacy went missing his father brought over his guns and more than $ 200,000 in checks for safekeeping. Stephen lost his job as an oak brook, ill., police officer for failing to disclose details of interactions he had with his dad after the disappearance. And he's run through his pension raising his father's children. So when lifetime called with a $ 10,000 offer to be on the show monster in my family, stephen took the deal. He says he told his father about the show, which details the life stephen, now 37, has had with drew and stacy's two children, who are in middle school; stephen also looked after drew's sons with savio, who are now young adults. Stephen says there was no \" a-ha moment, \" when he changed his mind about his father's role in stacy's disappearance, but he does recall her fear after savio's death. \" you kind of look back and think, maybe she did know something, or maybe something did happen, \" stephen says.

It would halt requirements that automakers build cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars including hybrids and electric vehicles. That obama-era rule, which aimed to cut the nation's greenhouse gas emissions while reducing oil consumption, was opposed by automakers who said it was overly burdensome. However, thursday's proposal goes much further than many major automakers wanted, and manufacturers are now worried that years of legal challenges and regulatory uncertainty could complicate their business. The governor of california, jerry brown, said his state was prepared to fight. \"for trump to now destroy a law first enacted at the request of ronald reagan five decades ago is a betrayal and an assault on the health of americans everywhere, \" he said. In a statement titled \"make cars great again \" that was published thursday on the wall street journal's website, transportation secretary elaine l.

They do provide insights into west wing thinking on a number of high-profile topics, however. Some samples highlighted by those two sources, along with nbc, usa today, cnn, and fox: lewinsky strategy: a talking-points memo in 1998 ahead of a report by independent counsel kenneth starr advised stressing that while clinton had admitted a \" serious mistake, \" this \" private mistake does not amount to an impeachable action. \"'the stalker ': clinton aide sidney blumenthal told a journalist that the president said lewinsky had \"complained that she was called 'the stalker ' in the white house … and that if he didn't have sexual intercourse with her she'd tell people that they did anyway. \" lewinsky job: as the white house grew worried about the scandal in april 1996, lewinsky was removed from her west wing job as aides discussed getting her a pentagon job. \"we are working closely with dod to make this happen for monica, \" wrote a white house personnel exec. \" we have not finalized the deal but are working toward that end. … our direction is to make sure she has a job in an agency. \" olbermann: then msnbc employee keith olbermann sent an apology to clinton for \" whatever part i may have played in perpetuating this ceaseless coverage \" of the lewinsky scandal. Kagan: supreme court justice elena kagan was a white house counsel who defended clinton in a lawsuit brought by former arkansas state employee paula jones. In a 1996 memo, kagan writes, \" i realize now that i may have really ( profanity ) up \" in regard to a miscommunication with other aides about a segment on a sunday talk show. \" god, do i feel like an idiot. \" gays in military: marine corps gen. Carl mundy is quoted as telling the president that saying \" i ' m gay \" is the \" same as i ' m kkk, nazi, rapist. \" at one point in that same 1993 meeting with the joint chiefs, clinton says that the \" people i would like to keep ( in the military ) wouldn't show up at ( a ) queer nation parade. \" whitewater: a memo from adviser paul begala in 1994 offered advice on how to handle the real estate scandal, namely by having the first couple go before the public to rebut the charges. \" in this situation, the clintons ' attitude is their message.

The news organizations picked by aides to attend the briefing were breitbart, the one america news network, the washington times, abc, cbs, the wall street journal, bloomberg, fox news, nbc, and reuters.

The journal says it would have joined the boycott if it had realized what was going on, the washington post reports. An la times reporter notes that a number of the outlets allowed into the camera-free briefing were smaller, \" trump-friendly \" organizations. The white house tried to downplay the incident, and spicer said it was his idea to only allow in certain reporters, nbc reports. Cnn states it was clearly being punished by the white house for reporting \" facts they don't like. \" fox news anchor bret baier was critical of spicer's decision, saying press briefings \" should be opened to all \" credentialed news organizations. He notes that other organizations had stood in protest when the obama administration tried to exclude fox news from interviews with its \" pay czar \" in 2009.

        "summary": "The muzaffarpur area produces 70 % of india's lychee fruit. It's also the site of a mysterious and deadly illness plaguing children in may and june for each of the last 22 years. Researchers now say the two facts go hand in hand. In a lancet study, they say children who filled up on lychee and skipped dinner ended up with dangerously low blood sugar and brain inflammation because of a toxin in the fruit, reports cnn. While bodies typically metabolize fatty acids to produce glucose, the hypoglycin toxin in lychee \" severely impaired \" a child's ability to do so, researchers say. As a result, children experienced fever, seizures and convulsions, and would slip in and out of consciousness. About 40 % of patients died, per the new york times. \" it was a very intense situation, because we witnessed children dying in front of our eyes every day, \" says a researcher. While investigating 400 cases of the illness, however, researchers realized sick children were 10 times more likely to have eaten lychee than healthy children, six times more likely to have visited an orchard recently, and twice as likely to have skipped dinner before becoming ill, reports live science. Then in 2014, lab tests revealed hypoglycin in lychee, and in unripe fruit in particular. Urine tests also showed high levels of hypoglycin in sick children. Experts now stress that kids should limit lychee consumption and eat an evening meal, though they add that a genetic component may also be at play in the deaths.

Nymex crude is currently up almost 2 %, above $ 100 a barrel, after being down ahead of the announcement.

Going into the meeting, saudi arabia had led a group of nations that favored increasing production, while iran and venezuela had stood steadfastly against it. Afterward, the saudi oil minister told bloomberg tv it was one of the worst opec meetings he'd ever attended. Iran's oil minister said his nation might seek an \" extraordinary \" meeting.",

The house easily approved a measure that would prohibit the white house from protecting millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation, reports the hill. In terms of immigration, it's only a symbolic gesture because the legislation stands no chance in the senate. The vote is still important, however, because it sets up boehner to pass a spending bill next week before the government runs out of money on dec. 11, reports ap. Conservatives opposed to obama's executive order on immigration had wanted to tie the immigration and spending bills together, but boehner, fearing a shutdown for which republicans would be blamed, kept them separate, reports the washington post. Step two comes next week when the house will vote on legislation to keep most of the government running for a year. As a concession to hardliners, the department of homeland security — the agency that oversees immigration — will get funding only through february, giving the new congress a chance to debate the issue. One wildcard: boehner is expected to lose votes from conservatives who don't think he's being aggressive enough against obama, and he will likely need democratic votes. Nancy pelosi, however, has been noncommittal to gain leverage on the final bill's details, reports politico. \" we can't do it unless we have a bill that is worthy of our support, \" she said today, as quoted in the la times.",

And what now for the rescued rabbit? just release it \" so it can end up in another wildfire? \" \" human lives need to take precedence over animal lives, \" tosch writes. \" let the animals take care of themselves. \" as callous as that sounds, it's a sentiment echoed by live science, which reports that wild animals as a rule know what they're doing when it comes to wildfires. A report from the us forest service found wildfires actually kill surprisingly few animals. Rabbits can survive fires by hiding out in their underground burrows, and those that aren't hiding or fleeing a fire — such as the one in the video — likely have a good reason for not doing so. Animals have been observed hanging around fires in the past in order to shepherd their young out of harm's way. \" fire is something animals have to deal with constantly, \" california fish and wildlife spokesperson peter tira tells the san francisco chronicle.

Instead of stranding the pilot, the stratotanker stuck by the f-16's side until it got back to its base, refueling every 15 minutes to keep it airborne. And that pilot would have had ample reason to worry, even if he had safely ejected and landed on the ground, notes sky news: in december 2014, a jordanian pilot crashed in syria and was captured by isis members and burned alive. \" the first thought i had … was extreme pride for the crew in how they handled the emergency, \" hallberg says. \" i ' m sure they think it was not a big deal.

The browser's impressive speed was the first thing rory cellan-jones at the bbc noticed. Microsoft, he writes, \" says this is all down to what it calls hardware acceleration — any site with graphics is sent to your computer's graphics processor, which previously has not been used by a browser. \" ie9 looks set to shake up the browser market, writes stephen shankland at cnet. The browser — with its \" support for new web standards, including plug-in-free video, \" and \" better performance with graphics, text, and javascript by taking advantage of modern computing hardware \" — is designed not just for the web as it is today, but for the changes in the works right now, he writes.",

Meanwhile, other happenings from the summit: there was progress, time notes, in the form of a us-china trade deal announced last night that will slash long-standing tariffs on many high-tech goods. ( among them, per politico: 25 % and 8 % tariffs on semiconductors and some medical equipment, respectively. ) the deal will broaden the 17-year-old information technology agreement, which proponents say could open up $ 1 trillion in annual sales of it products. Meanwhile, the ap reports that obama and vladimir putin \" circled each other warily \" on the sidelines, meeting privately three times today on sources of tension including ukraine, syria, and iran's nuclear program. But back to the gum-inspired outrage: \" we made this meeting so luxurious, with singing and dancing, but see obama stepping out of his car chewing gum like an idler, \" yin hong, a journalism professor in beijing, wrote on microblogging service sina weibo.
