A 34-year-old ohio woman was hit with robbery, aggravated-robbery, and kidnapping charges all thanks, in part, to an unflattering facebook photo. Monica hargrove drove a friend to pick up a prescription on aug. 30, only to allegedly pull a gun on her, rob her, and leave her on the side of the road. A warrant was issued for her arrest, and columbus police posted a mugshot of hargrove — one taken in connection with a previous arrest — on its facebook page as part of its sept. 10 \" warrant wednesday \" post. A rep for the columbus police tells the huffington post that hargrove called police within 48 hours of the posting, insisting that her photo be taken down. She apparently considered it an unattractive shot. Police invited hargrove to the station to talk about it; she actually showed up and was promptly arrested. Fox 28 notes hargrove got the chance to take a new mugshot, and the columbus dispatch reports that she ultimately \" got her way \": the offending photo, which racked up more than 50,000 views, was taken down from the department's feed. Kind of. You can still see it here, and the columbus division of police page shared a link to the huffington post story 16 hours ago with the infamous picture featured as well. Reads its post: \" looks like cpd &amp; suspect monica hargrove are getting some national attention. The [ mugshot ] she wanted taken off cpd facebook is now seen around the us and beyond! \" ( this, however, may be the best mugshot of all time. )",

The 49-year-old mom of three tells the magazine, \" i am very flattered, \" adding that she believes she's \" currently peaking. \" \" i ' m a slow rise … like a slow thanksgiving dinner roll, \" she says, per today. Roberts'repeat ascension to the top of the \" most beautiful \" list continues the recent trend of the magazine selecting women from the 45-and-over set as its honorees: last year's cover star was jennifer aniston at the age of 47 ( her second time on the cover ), and in 2015, sandra bullock took the top spot at the age of 50 — what the daily beast mused at the time was a \" strategic \" move on people's part. As for roberts, perhaps the secret to what people calls her \" ageless beauty \" can be found in the love she has for husband danny moder, whom she married in 2002. \" every day [ he ] walks in the door it's like a recurring dream, \" she says. \" i ' m like, ' ah, he's back!

Sunday brought an end to brazil's 1,192-day run of hosting mega-sports events, which started with soccer's confederations cup in 2013 and included the 2014 world cup, the ap reports. Awarded when brazil was a rising economic power, the sports pageants focused unprecedented attention on the country — much of it unwanted. As the shows went on, brazil plunged into a deep recession. A billion-dollar corruption scandal buffeted state-run oil company petrobras, and president dilma rousseff was removed from office in an impeachment trial just days after the olympics closed. Analysts say it all left a \" mixed legacy \" and the true impact may not be known for years.",

The candidate got a rough ride when he called radio shows in the state on monday, with wtmj host charlie sykes calling him a \" giant fraud \" as a conservative and likening his attacks on heidi cruz to the behavior of a \" 12-year-old bully on the playground, \" mashable reports. \" here in wisconsin, we value things like civility, decency, and actual conservative principles, \" sykes told trump. When sykes pressed trump about his history of sexist comments, trump said he \" never thought he would run for office \" and stressed that he had always treated women fairly in his business career, mediaite reports. Toward the end of the sykes interview, trump admitted he hadn't known beforehand that the host, a ted cruz supporter, was part of the #nevertrump movement. In another interview, wisn host vicki mckenna questioned trump's ability to unify republicans, the milwaukee journal sentinel reports. \" this is a state that pulled together republican coalitions, \" she said. \" scott walker didn't win or get the incredible reforms that we were actually able to pass through in a blue-state-turned-purple-state like wisconsin by dividing republicans. \" mckenna said trump hung up on her when they disagreed about his heidi cruz comments.",

Although \" e-venting \" via email, text, chat, or social media seems like the perfect antidote to a rotten day, studies have shown that people may actually become angrier after they post their online manifesto — and those who do so anonymously may become the most enraged of all. \" just because something makes you feel better doesn't mean it's healthy, \" brad bushman, a psych and communications professor at ohio state university, tells the journal. A 2002 study bushman published in the personality and social psychology bulletin suggested just that: he had 600 college students in three groups write an essay on abortion, which was subsequently criticized by another \" participant \" ( really the researchers ). Students in the first group were told to hit a punching bag while thinking of their critic, students in the second group were told to hit the bag while thinking about becoming fit, and a third control group simply sat quietly for two minutes. The angriest and most aggressive? those in the first group, whose venting \" did not lead to a more positive mood, \" the study notes ( the second \" fit \" group wasn't far behind in aggression ). But what makes e-venting especially risky? per the journal, we vent before we settle down, our posts have the potential to be shared ( and ruminated over ), and we don't get immediate feedback to maybe calm down. \" you can't see the eye rolling, \" bushman says.

The world's biggest online social network knocked wal-mart, the world's largest... ( associated press ) the world's biggest online social network knocked the world's largest retailer out of the top 10 list of the highest-valued companies in the standard &amp; poor's 500 index on monday and the gap widened on tuesday. While the switch is mostly symbolic — nothing specific happened this week to warrant it, and the difference between the two giants is not that big — it signals investors ' insatiable appetite for successful tech stocks. Apple, microsoft and google top the list of the highest-valued companies in the u.s., and facebook looks to be on its way to joining them. A company's market value is calculated by multiplying the number of shares of stock it has in circulation by the current price of one share. Facebook inc. Was valued at $ 238 billion at the close of trading tuesday, according to factset. Its stock gained $ 3.14, or 3.7 percent, at $ 87.88. Wal-mart stores inc. Was valued at",
            "Thanks to a steadily climbing stock price, facebook is now more valuable than the world's biggest retailer and the company that currently sits atop the fortune 500: walmart. Facebook's ( fb ) shares have gained more than 11 % in value so far this year; they are up more than 32 % over the past full year. The company's shares surged 7 % in the past week, pushing facebook's market value to about $ 238 billion. That tops walmart's ( wmt ) current market cap of $ 234 billion, knocking the massive retailer off of the list of the 10 largest companies by market value. Apple ( aapl ) is still the most valuable company based on market cap, valued at greater than $ 735 billion. The last time walmart ended a year outside the top 10 largest s&p 500 companies based on market cap was in 1997, according to the wall street journal. Walmart's stock is down more than 15 % since the start of the year, despite topping the latest fortune 500 for the third straight year with nearly half a billion dollars in sales. Last month, though, walmart joined several other u.s. Retailers by reporting quarterly sales figures that fell below wall street expectations. Facebook shot up this year's fortune 500 rankings, jumping nearly"

He returned with a gun minutes later and killed one person in the office and wounded nine others. Investigators believed the soldier killed in the office had been involved in the leave argument.

He then drove to a medical building, firing as he went, and killed one more soldier inside. \" we do not know why he entered that building, and we may never know why, \" a spokesman for the united states army criminal investigation command says.

The rehabilitation center says those messages would have been important evidence in an ongoing criminal investigation. Before irma made landfall, scott instructed nursing home officials to call his cellphone if there was trouble. The vice president of the rehabilitation center says she did just that four times, asking for \" immediate assistance \" to get power restored for the air conditioning system. State officials say some of the residents had body temperatures up to 109 degrees when they died.

A woman whose father went through an ac-less weekend at the nursing home earlier this year tells the bradenton herald — which has a deep look at the nursing home before and after irma — the place was a \" hellhole \" and \" torture chamber. \" \"when the heat gets up to a certain level, the patients are not breathing right because they are boiling up inside, \" she says.

More than a million people worldwide die from mosquito-borne maladies annually, according to the american mosquito control association. And now those bloodsuckers have a new weapon in their arsenal: the heretofore rare zika virus that is sweeping north in south america, nbc news reports. Typically more or less harmless — causing, at worst, mild symptoms in one out of five people infected — health officials in brazil now say the virus may be linked to a serious birth defect. In that country, vox reports, regions with the most cases of zika also have had an increase in microcephaly, which prevents babies ' heads and brains from growing to full size. \" there very definitely is something significant going on with microcephaly, \" cdc viral specialist ann powers tells nbc. However, she adds, it is not clear if the increase in cases of the birth defect is connected to zika. According to the pan american health organization, tests suggest the virus was in the amniotic fluid of two pregnant women. Ultrasounds in the same women show their babies may have microcephaly. And the virus has been linked to at least seven deaths in brazil as of nov. 30, vox reports. Discovered in 1947 in uganda's zika forest, the first notable outbreak of the virus didn't occur until 2007 in micronesia. It arrived in the americas last year, and has since been seen as far north as mexico, according to vox. Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that carries zika, nbc reports, lives in much of central and south america, as well as south florida and texas, and hawaii.

        "summary": "The scientist who invents a tinder for giant pandas may just single-handedly save the endangered species. A study published tuesday in nature communications found that pandas are much more likely to successfully mate when they're attracted to each other. It seems like an obvious conclusion, and that's why why researchers found it \" surprising that mate preferences have not figured more prominently in captive breeding programs, \" phys.org reports. Instead scientists have tried everything from viagra to artificial insemination to \" panda porn \" to bring the endangered animals back from the brink. \" our findings highlight that mate preference and other aspects of informed behavioral management could make the difference between success and failure of these programs, \" the study states. Live science reports researchers let pandas choose between two possible mates using various signs of attraction, indifference, or aggression. Pandas that were mutually attracted to each other had a 75 % likelihood of successfully reproducing. Without any attraction, the odds were closer to 0 %. Those odds improved when even one panda — male or female — showed signs of attraction. While this seems like an easy solution to breeding issues, scientists still have to address the problem of genetic diversity in a small population. Researchers recommend screening prospective mates for genetics first then letting pandas choose. According to phys.org, they believe this could make breeding programs both more successful and cost-effective.",

Data were collected during the breeding season ( 1 february – 1 may ) of 2012 and 2013. Giant pandas were housed in concrete walled, open-air enclosures ( 8 × 25 m ) that contained various forms of environmental enrichment ( for example, climbing platforms, water features and trees, and so on ) and an indoor enclosure area ( 3 × 8 m ). All enclosures had three barred 'howdy ' windows and a circular barred gate located on the long sides of the enclosure ( eight potential interaction windows, four per side ). Thus, giant pandas were able to interact through cage bars with neighbouring individuals in adjoining enclosures, but opportunities for physical contact were limited.

The boston globe has the backstory: \" john doe \" enrolled at harvard in august 2016; that next summer, while interning \" in a city hundreds of miles away from harvard \" he met \" jane roe, \" who is not a harvard student. Based on court filings, the harvard crimson reports that city was likely washington, dc. While there, the two on july 22 had a sexual encounter that he says she consented to and she says she didn't. Prosecutors decided not to take the case, and a civil personal injury suit filed by roe in march 2018 is pending. Where harvard comes into play: the school's office of dispute resolution in october began an investigation to determine \" whether he had committed sexual assault in violation of harvard's sexual and gender-based harassment [ policy ]. \" that policy itself is at the crux of doe's suit against the school; he argues the policy is in force under certain scenarios: if the incident occurred on harvard property, if there was an off-campus connection ( ie, at a program sponsored by harvard ), or if the conduct could \" creat[ e ] a hostile environment for a member of the university community. \" those scenarios don't apply, he argues, and he filed a civil suit wednesday seeking a halt to harvard's probe and $ 75,000 in damages. The suit describes harvard's disciplinary process against doe as \" arbitrary, capricious, malicious, and being conducted in bad faith. \" read the full globe article for more; it digs into some discrepancies between harvard's overarching policy and that of the specific college doe is enrolled at: the faculty of arts and sciences.

After romney described himself as a businessman — not a politician like gingrich — newt fired back: \" let's be candid. The only reason you didn't become a career politician is because you lost to ted kennedy in 1994. \" after the audience \" ooohed, \" romney returned fire: \" losing to teddy kennedy was probably the best thing i could have done for preparing me for the job i ' m seeking, \" the new york times reports. In other highlights: gingrich repeated his position that washington should let illegals stay in the us under certain strict conditions. \" that's not amnesty, \" he said. Romney countered that gingrich's plan \" will then create another magnet that draws people into our country illegally \" — but didn't say he would try to deport illegal immigrants. Gingrich defended his remark that palestinians are an \" invented people, \" and said it's time people admit that israel is a nation under fire from \" terrorists. \" countered romney: \" you don't speak for israel. If bibi netanyahu wants to say what you said, let him say it. \" bachmann called gingrich part of the problem and referred to him and romney as \" newt romney \" — meaning their policies are basically the same. \" if you want a difference, michele bachmann is the proven conservative, \" bachmann said. \" it's not newt romney. \" rick perry attacked gingrich's character by saying that \" if you cheat on your wife, you ' ll cheat on your business partner. \" gingrich has been married three times, and admitted to cheating on his second wife. Replied newt: \" it is a real issue. People have to look at the person to whom they are going to loan the presidency. \" fact check: gingrich said he has never supported cap and trade to curb pollution, but he did favor it in 2007 on pbs ' \" frontline. \" romney and michele bachmann almost agreed on the payroll tax cut. Bachmann said she opposes extending the tax for another year, and romney agreed, calling it a \" little band-aid. \" but he also supported a one-year extension: \" it's a temporary tax cut and it will help people in a very difficult time. \" romney actually challenged perry to a $ 10,000 bet, mediaite reports.

        "summary": "Islamic militants destroyed an aleppo hotel used by syrian government troops today by tunneling underneath the building and planting explosives there, the new york times reports. The syrian observatory for human rights says the government soldiers suffered casualties in the attack on the carlton citadel, where they had been based for two years, but there are no details yet on how many. The islamic front rebel group, which claimed responsibility for the attack, says 50 died, the ap reports. The explosives were linked to remote detonators, and according to the state news agency, other historical sites were also leveled today in the same way. The observatory says islamist forces tunneled from rebel-held areas to the destroyed sites; various parts of aleppo, syria's largest city, are held by both sides. One activist says government troops were using the carlton to launch mortar and sniper attacks. The islamic front is an alliance of islamic groups; many of its fighters broke away from the western-backed syrian free army last year. Little more than a month ago, a similar tunnel attack was staged in aleppo, but that hotel was only damaged and government troops were able to continue using it. Today's attack comes a day after rebels began evacuating homs, marking \" a de-facto end of the rebellion \" in the city once considered the \" capital of the revolution. \"",

            "Public health experts have warned that controversial experiments on mutant viruses could put human lives in danger by unleashing an accidental pandemic. Several groups of scientists around the world are creating and altering viruses to understand how natural strains might evolve into more lethal forms that spread easily among humans. But in a report published on tuesday, researchers at harvard and yale universities in the us argue that the benefits of the work are outweighed by the risk of pathogenic strains escaping from laboratories and spreading around the world. They calculate that if 10 high-containment labs in the us performed such experiments for 10 years, the chance of at least one person becoming infected was nearly 20 %. If an infected person left the laboratory, the virus might then spread more widely. \" we are not saying this is going to happen, but when the potential is a pandemic, even a small chance is something you have to weigh very heavily, \" said marc lipsitch, an epidemiologist at harvard school of public health, who wrote the report with alison galvani, an epidemiologist at yale. The report threatens to reignite a crisis in science that erupted in 2012 when a us biosecurity panel ruled that two separate studies on mutant bird flu were too dangerous to publish. They described the creation of new mutant strains that spread among ferrets – a proxy for humans –"

Several groups of scientists around the world are creating and altering viruses to understand how natural strains might evolve into more lethal forms that spread easily among humans. But in a report published on tuesday, researchers at harvard and yale universities in the us argue that the benefits of the work are outweighed by the risk of pathogenic strains escaping from laboratories and spreading around the world. They calculate that if 10 high-containment labs in the us performed such experiments for 10 years, the chance of at least one person becoming infected was nearly 20 %. If an infected person left the laboratory, the virus might then spread more widely. \" we are not saying this is going to happen, but when the potential is a pandemic, even a small chance is something you have to weigh very heavily, \" said marc lipsitch, an epidemiologist at harvard school of public health, who wrote the report with alison galvani, an epidemiologist at yale. The report threatens to reignite a crisis in science that erupted in 2012 when a us biosecurity panel ruled that two separate studies on mutant bird flu were too dangerous to publish. They described the creation of new mutant strains that spread among ferrets – a proxy for humans –"

        "summary": "A fired yahoo employee is suing the tech company, claiming — among other things — that it discriminates against men, partially resulting in his termination, ars technica reports. According to the los angeles times, yahoo editorial director gregory anderson was told in 2014 that he was in the bottom 5 % of employees based on quarterly performance reviews and was being fired. Prior to his firing, which he partly blames on gender discrimination, he claims he was given a raise and promoted; he had been with the company four years. \" [ chief marketing officer kathy ] savitt has publicly expressed support for increasing the number of women in media and has intentionally hired and promoted women because of their gender, while terminating, demoting, or laying off male employees because of their gender, \" ars technica quotes anderson's lawyer. Anderson's lawsuit, which \" itemize[ s ] the damages at $ 5 million, \" his lawyer tells bloomberg, blames yahoo's quarterly review process — in which managers rank employees on a scale of zero to five — for allowing firings \" to be made on the basis of personal biases and stereotyping. \" in addition, the lawsuit alleges that the process favors women. Quarterly reviews were implemented by yahoo chief executive marissa mayer in 2012, the new york times reports. Recently, they may be responsible for the inadvertent firing of up to 30 employees at the end of last month, the new york post reports. \" they put people on firing lists who they didn't mean to — people who were lower on the performance scale but who weren't meant to get fired, \" an inside source says.

The department has told township high school district 211 that it has 30 days to comply with anti-discrimination law title ix and allow the student, who identifies as a girl, to use the locker room, reports the chicago sun-times, which notes that the long-running case has attracted a lot of attention because of its implications for school districts across the country. The school district maintains that allowing the student to use the girls locker room would violate the privacy rights of other students. The civil rights complaint was filed two years ago and a deal was almost reached last week, when the district used curtains to create a private area in the locker room, reports the chicago tribune. The student agreed to use the area to change, but a spokesman for the aclu of illinois, which is representing her, tells the tribune that the case went ahead because the district made it clear that the student would be required to use the private area, which amounts to \" blatant discrimination \" — and sends the message that she is not accepted. In a statement, the student said she had been \" stigmatized \" and the ruling made monday a \" good day for all students, but especially those who are transgender all across the nation, \" reports the daily herald.

Tom corbett and chief justice ron castille have demanded that kane provide them copies of all emails that are part of her review so they can check for any involvement by anyone in their respective branches of government. The emails first surfaced publicly as a result of right-to-know requests by various pennsylvania media, including the morning call. Kane released only a portion of those emails to the media last week, stating they were found in the email accounts of eight former attorney general staffers. It is not publicly known how many sexually explicit emails exist and how many people received them. Mccaffery is identified as recipient or sender of 54 emails reviewed by the morning call, and the emails show the judge sent them from a personal comcast account that now appears to be inactive. The emails are part of an extensive email chain, with some including photos of nude centerfolds, sex videos,",

( ap ) — a widening scandal over the exchange of emails containing pornography by current and former members of the attorney general's office has gripped the pennsylvania capitol all week. Pennsylvania's state supreme court chief justice demanded information on whether any judges were part of the exchanges. Gov.

And on thursday, two top officials who followed corbett from the attorney general's office into his gubernatorial administration resigned. Corbett disclosed the resignations of environmental protection secretary christopher abruzzo and glenn parno, a top lawyer in the department of environmental protection, in separate announcements hours apart, just as the attorney general's office was releasing copies of their email messages to the governor's office and news organizations"

Six-year-old ryker died at a florida hospital sunday, weeks after putting his hand in a bucket holding a bat his father had found, reports nbc news. Henry roque says he specifically told his son not to touch the bat, but ryker didn't listen, and ended up with a scratch. With his son in tears at the thought of getting a vaccine shot in case the bat had rabies, roque avoided the hospital and thoroughly washed the scratch instead. It wasn't enough. A week later, ryker told his parents he had a headache and his fingers were numb. \" i picked him up and i put him on the ground and he fell right to the floor, \" roque tells today. \" i could not believe this … i said ' walk for me, ryker, ' and he couldn't walk. \" at a hospital, doctors told roque that ryker indeed had rabies and that cases are almost always fatal once symptoms appear. Doctors hoped placing the boy in a medically induced coma might allow his body to fight off the virus in an experimental treatment known as the milwaukee protocol, which has saved two other children in the us, per nbc miami. But that wasn't enough, either. Experts are now warning people to seek out a life-saving vaccine immediately after exposure to rabies and to limit possible exposure. In this case, the infected bat may have been in the roque family's home for \" a week or two prior to the boy going to the hospital, \" a lake county sheriff tells the orlando sentinel. He adds a dog and cat were taken from the home to be tested for rabies, with the results not yet clear. ( rabies killed a woman shortly after she gave birth. )",

Lawyers for couch say the judge didn't have the authority to sentence couch to jail time because the judge only has purview over criminal cases.

Couch was sentenced to 10 years ' probation in 2013 when he crashed his pickup truck into a group of people helping a disabled vehicle. Couch was drunk at the time, and four of the people died. A psychologist defending couch said the teen never learned the difference between right and wrong and was suffering from \" affluenza \" thanks to his rich upbringing. Couch's lawyers filed the motion to release him from jail last friday. The motion has already been denied twice in lower courts.",

The latter turns out to be the case in israel, where a town has been found — and it could be one mentioned in a well-known bible story. Livescience reports that it was found along the northwest side of the sea of galilee, and british archaeologists suggest that it is dalmanutha, a place that factors into the gospel of mark's recounting of jesus feeding a great crowd of people with just a few fish and loaves of bread: dalmanutha is where he briefly sailed after that miracle. The archaeologists made their discovery during a field survey, and team lead ken dark theorizes it is indeed dalmanutha, and one reason he gives is that artifacts collected there indicate it was an active city at the start of the common era. In a june lecture dark gave at the university of edinburgh, he further explained his thought process, as summarized on the blog of the centre for the study of christian origins: \" it is hard to imagine that a roman-period coastal community of this size is nowhere mentioned in textual sources, and the site might be identified with one of the unlocated toponyms known from the bible, perhaps the dalmanutha of mark 8: 10. \" ( in other news in the region, archaeologists recently found a treasure trove in jerusalem. )",

Ken is an archaeologist with a great deal of experience in all things to do with the roman empire, and we were particularly interested to hear of his experiences in mapping the area around nazareth and the sea of galilee. The two extended lectures were extremely lively and we all learnt a great deal from them. I was particularly struck by the difference in archaeology between romanized sepphoris and nazareth; it was also news to me that there was no road between nazareth and sepphoris – clearly this puts some question marks over reconstructions that have jesus continually making his way over to the city. By way of contrast, there was a good road between nazareth ( which ken portrayed as a small jewish regional town rather than a hamlet ) and the larger and more romanized towns around the the sea of galilee. Sumaries of the two lecturesare posted below. Archaeology of roman-period nazareth recent work by the nazareth archaeological project ( established in 2004 ) is transforming our understanding of first-century nazareth and its hinterland, by applying modern archaeological methods and theory to its study for this first time.

Slate and salon are featuring excerpts from a new biography of lewin by molly knight raskin. He was born in denver, but moved to israel with his family at age 14, where he attended a technology school and later signed up for the israeli defense force, serving as a commando in an elite counterterrorism unit. He eventually ended up at mit on a full scholarship, and while there he wrote algorithms to make web content delivery quicker and more efficient. \" mit has a lot of really smart people, and danny stood out even among that rarified environment, \" one of his professors tells cnn. Based on those algorithms, lewin and that professor founded software company akamai; he was taking american airlines flight 11 to a business meeting on september 11. After the hijacking began, lewin, 31 — who raskin suggests could have suspected something was amiss before anyone else, because of his idf training and knowledge of conversational arabic — got up and struggled with one of the terrorists. Per a 9/11 commission report issued four years after the attack and based largely on the info two flight attendants relayed to authorities, satam al-suqami most likely killed lewin from behind, by slashing his throat. He died between 8: 15am and 8: 20am, and the plane slammed into the world trade center at 8: 46am. \" he was the first victim of the first war of the 21st century, \" says lewin's best friend. Akamai, now a multibillion-dollar business, was struggling on september 11 — but, raskin notes, most major news sites managed to stay up and running amid the avalanche of traffic that day because of it.

According to dayton daily news, hopkins cited rising costs and security as reasons for pulling out. It was originally expected to cost wsu $ 3.5 million to host the debate, but that had increased to more than $ 8 million recently. That price increase comes at a time when wsu is already planning more than $ 27 million in budget cuts. \"given the financial issues the university is grappling with, from the start this seemed like a kind of dubious proposition, \" faculty union president martin kich says. Security was also becoming an issue for wsu. \"over the last few weeks we have had a growing concern over what it would take to guarantee the safety and security of our campus, \" politico quotes hopkins as saying. Unlike private universities that have hosted debates in the past, wsu couldn't legally close its campus to the public during the debate, making security more difficult. Wsu will probably lose at least some of the $ 2.5 million it has already put toward hosting the debate. \"i really wanted this experience for our students, \" the daily news quotes hopkins as saying. The debate will now be held at new york's hofstra university, which hosted a presidential debate in 2012 and had agreed to be a backup this year, cnn reports. The other two scheduled presidential debates will take place at washington university in st. Louis and the university of nevada-las vegas.",

Devin nunes, r-calif., and two investigators on the committee. The memo, declassified by president trump and released by republicans on the house intelligence committee friday, outlines how foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) warrants were obtained for former trump campaign official carter page, and what relationship the trump dossier compiled by former british intelligence officer christopher steele had with those fisa warrant applications. Gowdy said the public will \" never know \" if the surveillance against page was justified, saying the warrants relied on three pieces of information -- the dossier, a reference to a yahoo news article and other information available to the fisa court judges who approved warrants.

Cyrus started out wearing practically nothing, then managed to find a way to strip down even further from there. She spent much of the performance with her tongue sticking out and, when robin thicke took the stage for a duet, she added a foam finger that, of course, she used rather suggestively. \" raise your hand if you feel personally victimized by miley cyrus ' vma performance, \" reads one representative tweet.

In a newly released letter seized during the 2011 raid that killed the al-qaeda leader, he urges americans to launch a \" great revolution for freedom \" to untether president obama from the influences of corporate lobbyists and fight climate change, reuters reports. Getting rid of lobbyists would let obama make \" a rational decision to save humanity from the harmful gases that threaten its destiny, \" he writes. The rambling letter, which is addressed \" especially [ to ] the youth \" of america, appears to date from early in obama's first term and includes references to the 2008 economic crisis, mediaite reports. Bin laden apparently wasn't a fan of bank bailouts: america's financial system was 48 hours away from collapse when the administration used taxpayer money to \" rescue the vultures by using the assets of the victims, \" he writes. In another letter, he argues that reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be a good way to mark the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, saying the world \" should put its efforts into attempting to reduce the release of gases \" instead of fighting islam. Both letters are unsigned, but us intelligence officials have attributed them to bin laden. Also among the documents released tuesday: a handwritten will that explained where his millions should go.

The letter, which is unsigned but the office of the director of national intelligence attributes to bin laden, is addressed \"to the american people [ … ] specifically to those who support real change, especially the youth. \" the main topic of the letter, bin laden wrote, \"is the overwhelming control of capital [ … ] and its effect on the ongoing war between us. \" the letter is undated, but references to current events place its writing early in obama's first term. The somewhat disjointed address touches on a wide range of topics, including a court decision ( possibly the january 2010 citizens united supreme court ruling ), which he described as a \"decision by the court in favor of corporations to intervene in the political arena \" and \"not [ a victory ] for the american people except for the big corporations. \" in the letter, bin laden blamed the \"tyranny of the control of capital by large companies \" for the 2007-2008 economic crisis. \"your",

Reuters/site monitoring service via reuters tv the letter was among materials that were seized in the may 2, 2011, u.s. Raid on bin laden's hideout in pakistan that killed the al qaeda chief and which were released on tuesday by the obama administration. The undated, unsigned letter \"to the american people, \" which u.s.

            "Among the cache of documents from osama bin laden's bookshelf released to the public tuesday is a curious letter, apparently written by the late al-qaeda founder, enjoining the american people to undertake a \"great revolution for freedom, \" liberating the then-recently inaugurated president barack obama from the chokehold of lobbyists, allowing him to take action against both corporate control and climate change. The letter, which is unsigned but the office of the director of national intelligence attributes to bin laden, is addressed \"to the american people [ … ] specifically to those who support real change, especially the youth. \" the main topic of the letter, bin laden wrote, \"is the overwhelming control of capital [ … ] and its effect on the ongoing war between us. \" the letter is undated, but references to current events place its writing early in obama's first term. The somewhat disjointed address touches on a wide range of topics, including a court decision ( possibly the january 2010 citizens united supreme court ruling ), which he described as a \"decision by the court in favor of corporations to intervene in the political arena \" and \"not [ a victory ] for the american people except for the big corporations. \" in the letter, bin laden blamed the \"tyranny of the control of capital by large companies \" for the 2007-2008 economic crisis. \"your",

Zach nelson printed out a shift knob and popped the xbox's vibrating mechanism inside. Using ford's open-source software and a tablet, he was able to gather information on a mustang's engine speed, accelerator position, and more, wired reports. That made it possible to program the shifter to vibrate at helpful moments — identifying, for instance, the moment when shifting will ensure top fuel efficiency. So what do the experts think of all this? at motortrend, scott burgess calls the design \" elegantly simple, \" and he applauds ford's open-source software, called openxc. \" the open-source philosophy creates a new kind of collaboration for an automaker, \" he writes.

Yvonne allen wrote about the ordeal on an aclu blog in april, saying her faith \" was tested in a way that was humiliating and demeaning. \" wearing a headscarf on a daily basis is, allen writes, an \" integral \" part of her christian faith; she says that in 1 corinthians 11 paul \" speaks very clearly without ambiguity \" on the matter. Allen says that when she explained to dmv staff last december that she is christian, she was told that the religious exemption only applies to muslims and was later \" ridiculed \" by the probate staff, reports al.com. Allen decided to take action because, as an aclu executive director puts it, \" the government cannot discriminate between faiths in granting religious accommodations. \" the state's law enforcement agency allows for religious accommodation for headgear in driver's license photos so long as the face is not hidden. The lawsuit asks a federal judge to allow the photo to be retaken with the headscarf on, and to grant allen damages and attorneys ' fees.

The higher death rate reverses a largely downhill trend that's been going on since the 1930s. The last time the death rate went up was in 2005. There were also blips in 1999 and 1993. But there's a chance a deadlier 2015 is a sign of a new trend, not an anomaly. Suicide rates went up 24 % between 1999 and 2014, and drug overdoses are up 137 % since 2000. Also up in 2015: deaths from guns, homicides, alzheimer's, parkinson's, hypertension, and more. The rise in the death rate corresponds with a drop in the us birth rate. The wall street journal reports there were 3.98 million births in the us in 2015. That's down 0.3 % from 2004. Teen births were at their lowest point in decades, dropping 64 % since 1991. Birth rates were down for both black and white women but up for hispanic women. \"we're in a period where population growth has been a bit slower, \" jeffrey passel, senior demographer at the pew research center, tells the journal. \"to keep the labor force growing, we're going to need to have pretty healthy levels of immigration. \"",
