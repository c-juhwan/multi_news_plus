        "summary": "He's being called \" the harvey weinstein of fashion, \" but controversy has been swirling around fashion photographer terry richardson for years. With weinstein's alleged sexual harassment and assault in the spotlight now, however, the huffington post says richardson's days in the fashion industry are likely coming to an end. For nearly 20 years, per mashable, richardson has been hit with accusations of sexual harassment and assault, but after condé nast international said in a company email monday that its publications ( including vogue, gq, and vanity fair ) would no longer work with him, the dominoes started falling. Fashion brands bulgari, valentino, and diesel now say they will not work with him again. Target, h&m, and aldo had already banned him. Richardson has been accused of actions including taking off his clothes in front of models, offering vogue shoots in exchange for sex, putting his penis in models ' mouths, asking models to touch his genitals, and asking them to use their tampons to make tea. Some models have refused to work with him, but he's continued to get high-profile work. He's denied the allegations in the past, and did so again in a statement to buzzfeed after the condé nast email was released: \" [ richardson ] is an artist who has been known for his sexually explicit work so many of his professional interactions with subjects were sexual and explicit in nature but all of the subjects of his work participated consensually, \" it reads in part. Meanwhile, model jamie peck, one of the first people to speak publicly about richardson's alleged behavior, writes in the guardian about why it took so long for him to fall.",

But so what? even if the modest fixes have saved the site and the law — as dana milbank argued today in the washington post — the problems have already done serious, lasting damage to the progressive cause, writes matthew yglesias at slate. To explain why, he recounts his recent \" extremely frustrating \" attempt to obtain, not insurance, but a large garbage bin from dc's department of public works. The system was needlessly inconvenient and confusing, and phone support didn't help; staffers were clearly weary from \" a daily routine of dealing with irate customers. \" \" not every interaction with a government agency is this aggravating, \" yglesias allows, \" but many of them are. \" these bureaucracies basically work — \" the trash ( mostly ) gets picked up \" — but no one loves them. Obamacare, too, may basically work. But progressives had hoped to restore faith in government, to prove it deserved a bigger role in society. Instead, we have \" a system that functions about as well as the dc garbage bin operation, amtrak security theater, or the dmv. \" click for the full post.",

Eric greitens, a sometimes brash outsider whose unconventional resume as a rhodes scholar and navy seal officer made him a rising star in republican politics, abruptly announced his resignation tuesday after a scandal involving an affair with his former hairdresser led to a broader investigation by prosecutors and state legislators. The 44-year-old governor made the announcement nearly 17 months after taking the oath as missouri's chief executive with a pledge to root out \" corrupt career politicians. \" the investigations of him widened to include questions about whether he had violated the law in financing the campaign. Greitens said his resignation would take effect friday, the ap reports. A st. Louis grand jury indicted greitens on feb. 22 on one felony count of invasion of privacy for allegedly taking a photo of the woman without her consent at his home in 2015, before he was elected governor. The charge was dismissed during jury selection, but a special prosecutor was considering whether to refile charges. In april, the local st. Louis prosecutor's office charged greitens with another felony, alleging that he improperly used the donor list for a charity that he'd founded to raise money for his 2016 campaign. Less than two weeks ago, the missouri legislature began meeting in special session to consider whether to pursue impeachment proceedings to try to oust greitens from office. A special house investigatory committee had subpoenaed greitens to testify next monday. The ap has much more on the story, plus a detailed timeline.",

In a seven-point plan posted to his website and publicized by a tweet, trump says he will do away with the individual health insurance mandate, as well as allow competition over states lines for health care plans, and block grant medicaid to the states, allowing them to follow through on his prescription to \"eliminate fraud, waste and abuse to preserve our precious resources. \" i am going to repeal and replace obamacare! read more about my positions on healthcare reform here: https://t.co/wwivhiud06 — donald j.

Health care system after repeatedly pledging to \" repeal and replace obamacare with something much better. \" trump published a seven-point health care reform plan that calls for repealing obamacare, breaking down state barriers that prevent the sale of health insurance across state lines and making individuals ' health insurance premium payments fully tax deductible. The reforms, which trump calls \" simply a place to start, \" are aimed at broadening access to health care, making health care more affordable and improving the quality of care, according to the plan published",
            "Healthcare reform to make america great again since march of 2010, the american people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the affordable care act — obamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the house and senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan president in american history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don't work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the democrats and president obama, and abetted by the supreme court, will be difficult to repair unless the next president and a republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry.

        "summary": "Last month, a team led by tom colbert claimed a vietnam vet now in his 70s named robert rackstraw was db cooper, the bandit who hijacked a plane in the pacific northwest in november 1971, then parachuted out over southern washington state with $ 200,000 in ransom cash. On thursday outside of the fbi's dc headquarters, they announced their newest theory, per the seattle post-intelligencer: that db cooper ( aka rackstraw ) was a black ops cia operative who may have been tied to the iran-contra scandal, and whom the fbi may have helped keep hidden. What spurred their speculation: the deciphering of code on five letters db cooper sent after the hijacking. Some of the broken code led back to military units rackstraw served in in vietnam, but new decryptions include \" a startling claim \" that \" if captured, he expects a get-out-of-jail card from a federal spy agency, \" colbert said in a release, per the new york daily news. Per colbert, one decryption read: \" if catch i am cia... Rwr, \" the last set of letters being rackstraw's initials. Colbert also put together a timeline of what he believes to have been rackstraw's cia missions, running from 1969 and possibly up through the ' 80s, when the iran-contra affair took place, and notes other cia ties to rackstraw. Backing him are foia records from the pentagon that show rackstraw received 400 hours of green beret training in special forces and psychological operations. Colbert thinks the fbi has been stifling the story. \" it's more than a bunch of old guys chasing another old guy over forgotten history, \" he says in an email to the new york daily news. \" this is about current fbi agents stonewalling, covering up, and flat-out lying for mentors and g-men long gone, over decades — all because of an unholy deal to hide and protect a valuable cia black ops pilot known as db cooper. \" rackstraw, meanwhile, has issued cryptic non-denials that he's the long-lost cooper.",

But as the washington post reports, we buy those supplements anyway, and lots of them: americans spend roughly $ 1.2 billion each year on fish oil pills and associated products; one of the authors of that jama research told reuters in 2013 that about 10 % of americans take them. They're touted for the good fatty acids — omega-3s — they contain. But while they're generally considered safe to take, it's pretty unclear whether they're beneficial for heart health. Writing for the post, peter whoriskey astutely points out that even the national institutes of health and american heart association can't really make up their minds. The former endorses the supplements, then states \" omega-3s in supplement form have not been shown to protect against heart disease \" on its website; a scientific consultant with the nih says the endorsement was supplied by a third-party contributor. As for the aha, it advises people battling heart disease to ask their doctor about the supplements, but a former aha president tells whoriskey, \" it would be a good time for that to be updated. \" as for those 24 aforementioned studies, all but two showed no benefit.

        "summary": "French security forces have swarmed a small industrial town northeast of paris in an operation to capture — or, the country's interior minister says, \" neutralize \" — a pair of armed suspects in the storming of satirical newspaper charlie hebdo. The suspects are believed to be holed up in a printing business in the town of dammartin-en-goele, about 25 miles northeast of paris, and are thought to have at least one hostage, the guardian reports. Meanwhile, a separate situation with multiple hostages was unfolding at a kosher market in paris, and it appears to be related, reports the bbc. The hostage-taker there is believed to be the person who fatally shot a policewoman in paris yesterday. Two people were reportedly killed in the market. Police also released the names of two people sought in the police officer's death — a male, amedy coulibaly, 32, and a female, hayat boumeddiene, 26. At least one is believed to know hebdo suspects cherif and said kouachi. The town of dammartin-en-goele, meanwhile, has been locked down, and while some residents say cellphones are no longer working, an official in the town has told the ap that phone communication has been established with the men. The suspects apparently agreed to allow a school near their location be evacuated. A lawmaker inside the command post tells french television the men \" want to die as martyrs. \" the town is just 8 miles away from charles de gaulle airport, where operations have been partially suspended, cnn reports. A bbc reporter in the town describes it as a \" dramatic scene, \" with the area \" rapidly filling up with thousands of french police and anti-terror forces, \" as well as a convoy of ambulances. The siege follows a huge manhunt for the kouachi brothers, who had been on the us no-fly list for years before wednesday's attack. Shots were fired as the brothers stole a car in the early morning hours today, says a french security official.",

Sony pictures, however, which booked the show two months ago, is less than thrilled, reports the new york times. The studio is trying to promote ghostbusters, as the times puts it, its marketing team \" has been fighting to tamp down what it sees as a misogynistic, internet-based assault on the movie. \" a perceived alliance with clinton isn't likely to do sony any favors as it courts the young male audience that typically buoys summer blockbusters. The ghostbusters trailer may be the most disliked trailer on youtube, but much of the negative response has been from just a few fan sites, sources tell the times. For example, a trailer uploaded to facebook was viewed favorably, and it was seen by more men than women. Nonetheless, sony has been trying to appeal to more men with seductive movie posters of film star kristen wiig.

The original description, seen in a screenshot adrienne keene posted on the native appropriations website, read as follows: \" an american indian woman is supposed to marry the village's best warrior, but she yearns for something more — and soon meets capt. John smith. \" keene's reaction: \" the use of ' woman ' and ' yearns ' is so … gross. Shudder. … it overly sexualizes the film, and only positions pocahontas in relation to her romantic options, not as a human being, you know, doing things. \" she also pointed out the \" colonial white supremacy embedded... Of course pocahontas wouldn't be content with her backwards native ways with her native man … she yearns for something more. Spoiler alert: it's a white dude. \" after noticing the description last month, keene went on a self-described \" mini twitter rant, \" and netflix responded via email, telling keene \" you were right to point out that we could do better. The synopsis has been updated to better reflect pocahontas ' active role and to remove the suggestion that john smith was her ultimate goal. \" the new wording: \" a young american indian girl tries to follow her heart and protect her tribe when settlers arrive and threaten the land she loves. \" not everyone on social media appreciated keene's cultural intervention — she tweeted that \" this weekend i took all the hate-tweets i received, put them in a spreadsheet, &amp; am currently coding them for a journal article \" — but she also had plenty of support, and she's pleased with netflix's effort and her own. \" sometimes i ' m still amazed by the power of the internet, \" she wrote in a more recent post.

        "summary": "Over the next three months, the baltic country of estonia will become a little bit taller. That's because it has decided to change how it measures heights above sea level, converting from an old russian system to something called the european vertical reference system, reports the postimees newspaper. The upshot is that elevations across the country will be upped by 6 to 9.5 inches depending on the location. The country's highest point, suur-munamagi, which is essentially a big hill with a lookout point on top, will accordingly add 8 inches to its height above sea level, putting it at 1,041 feet, reports the bbc. \" the baltic elevation system of 1977 is obsolete, \" says estonian land board official tambet tiits. \" and then there's the wish to be in one and the same system with europe. \" another wrench: half of the country's current elevation markers suffered damage that has made the process of establishing elevation even more cumbersome. Most countries in europe — including regional neighbors latvia, lithuania, and finland — already use the european system, which references amsterdam's ordnance datum, reports err. Authorities expect a three-month transition period and will phase out the russian system by the first day of 2018. ( estonians are the third tallest humans on the planet. )",

It is switching away from the russian-based datum to the european vertical reference system, which adds between 15-24cms ( 6-9.5 inches ) to vertical measurements in the country, depending on the area, the postimees newspaper reports. That means local cartographers will have to add 20cm to suur-munamagi, the country's highest point, which will measure in at 317.4m ( 1,041 feet ) above sea level from the beginning of next year. Previously, heights were calculated from the kronstadt tide gauge in st petersburg, the reference system used for russia and most countries which were under the sphere of the former soviet union. But as a member of nato and the european union, estonia is keen to move over to standards used by its allies. Estonian land board official tambet tiits told national broadcaster err that \" the baltic elevation system of 1977 is obsolete...

            "Estonia is giving up the kronstadt tide gauge as its main reference point for measuring vertical elevation and altitude, and instead joining the european vertical reference system based on the amsterdam ordnance datum. The step takes the country from the russian to the european geodetic reference system. Minister of the environment siim kiisler ( irl ) signed off on the necessary changes, err's online news reported on thursday. Preparations for the change had taken a long time, but in time for its 100th anniversary, estonia was now finally changing systems, kiisler said. He added that moving from the kronstadt gauge to the amsterdam ordnance datum meant a 15 to 24-centimeter elevation increase depending on the area. For example, suur-munamägi, at 317.2 m estonia's highest point, would now be 317.4 m above sea level, kiisler explained. The kronstadt tide gauge serves as the reference point for altitude and elevation in russia as well as in plenty of countries that used to belong to the russian empire or the soviet union at some point. It is still widely used in europe's eastern countries, including slovakia, czechia, and hungary.

Encrusted in a rock-hard layer of sand and shell, the hand-powered civil war submarine that slumbered off charleston, sc, for almost 140 years had to be painstakingly soaked and cleaned. But after three years of scrubbing, the first sub to sink an enemy ship is finally beginning to gleam. \" it looks like a submarine now, as opposed to a corroded artifact, \" michael scafuri, the lead archaeologist of the project at clemson university's warren lasch conservation center, tells the post and courier. Most of the concretion that remains is in the interior, but even that is being peeled away to reveal gears, cranks, and some surprises — like a human tooth. Scafuri tells wcsc that the tooth, corroded to the iron of a crank handle, belonged to crew member frank collins, who was found to be missing several teeth when his remains were buried in 2004. It would've detached long after the confederate sub sank on feb. 17, 1864, just after downing the union's housatonic. Removing layers of debris also revealed cloth and metal on cranks that would've protected hands from chafing, but why the sub sank remains a mystery. \" we will always have an element of uncertainty, \" says scafuri. For now, \" everything is on the table within reason. \" a 2016 study determined it was unlikely that the crew members suffocated and that the sub sank as a result, per the charleston city paper.

However, france warned its citizens about traveling to st. Louis, baltimore, and cleveland during riots last summer. And canada and germany have issued travel advisories in the past regarding us gun violence. The us also has a travel advisory out for the bahamas.

        "summary": "Three university of oregon players on the ducks football team are recuperating at a local hospital after a series of intense workouts last week that left one of the players with a rare, serious condition, the oregonian reports. Offensive linemen doug brenner and sam poutasi and tight end cam mccormick are in fair condition, per a hospital spokeswoman. But poutasi's mom says her son now has rhabdomyolysis, a condition where muscle tissue breaks into pieces that enter the bloodstream, which can lead to kidney failure. The ncaa sports medicine handbook says hard workouts right after a \" transitional period \" like the winter break the players just had could lead to rhabdomyolysis cases. The injuries come just a little over a month after willie taggart came aboard as the team coach, saying back in december his team needed to get \" bigger and stronger, \" per the register-guard. To say the ducks ' workouts are rigorous may be an understatement, based on multiple sources who talked to the oregonian, offering comparisons to military basic training and rumors that some of the participants were fainting ( a university official denies that allegation ). \" the safety and welfare of all of our student-athletes is paramount in all that we do, \" the college says in a statement, adding that \" modifications \" have been incorporated into the regimen to make sure such injuries don't happen again. Other players have taken to social media to dismiss claims of any over-the-top exercise, with junior cornerback ugochukwu amadi tweeting it's \" not even what the media is portraying it to be, \" while offensive tackle tyrell crosby posted, \" i have no idea what's soft or out of shape about a man pushing himself until he can't go no more. \" ( how bad is too much exercise? )",

            "Summaries for consumers rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life‐threatening condition where damaged muscle tissue breaks down quickly, and products of damaged muscle cells are released into the bloodstream. Of these products, a protein called myoglobin is harmful to kidney health and can lead to acute kidney injury. There is some evidence to suggest that continuous renal replacement therapy ( crrt ) may provide benefits for people with rhabdomyolysis. High cholesterol levels could mean an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Certain medications called statins lower the amount of cholesterol in the blood. They can prevent related medical conditions and increase life expectancy. Whether or not it's worth taking them will depend on what other risk factors you have, though.if the risk of cardiovascular disease can't be reduced enough through general measures, treatment with medication can be considered. Whether treatment with medication is a good idea will mostly depend on individual risk factors and how you yourself view the pros and cons of the treatment.the main factor is whether you have already had cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery disease. That may greatly increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke. This risk can be reduced using medication.when deciding whether or not to have a certain treatment, it can help to find out about the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment. Various groups of drugs can be used for the treatment of high cholesterol. But only one group of drugs, known as statins, has been well studied in people who have never had a heart attack, stroke or other type of cardiovascular disease. Many different statins have been approved in germany, including atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin. The long-term treatment of coronary artery disease ( cad ) mainly involves taking medication. Various medications can relieve the symptoms and lower the risk of complications.in order to prevent the development of related medical conditions, all people who have coronary artery disease ( cad ) are advised to take two types of medication: antiplatelets to prevent blood clots, and statins to protect the blood vessels.beta blockers are sometimes taken too, to reduce the heart's workload, particularly in people who have heart failure or high blood pressure.good-quality studies have proven that these medications can lower the risk of complications such as heart attacks or strokes. People who have certain other medical conditions too may take other medications such as ace inhibitors. But even the very best treatment with medications will offer only limited protection from heart disease.all medications can have side effects"

Rather than disappoint his supporters back home in johannesburg, he says he opted for \" a stealth entry. \" how far he got is unclear: he claims on facebook to have climbed 24,000 of the mountain's 29,029 feet; the afp cites nepalese officials who say davy told them he made it to camp two, around 21,000 feet.

Except for this: a propublica investigation finds that the maps are often based on outdated information, resulting in huge headaches for homeowners whose insurance premiums are based on them. Countless cases reveal two big themes: the maps put homeowners in flood zones that aren't actually flood zones. One homeowner in texas discovered she was in a \" special flood hazard area \" even though she lives atop a hill. After a long fight, she got fema to admit the mistake. Maybe worse, some homeowners who do live in flood zones don't know it. North dakota, for example, is about to get \" updated \" maps, but those maps won't reflect data from the biggest floods in state history — in 1997, 2009, and 2011. The problem is that while fema is putting out digitized maps these days, they are often based on data from paper maps that go back decades. Surely, modern technology can fix this? yep, a system called lidar in which planes fire laser pulses at the ground can provide accuracy 10 times greater than the old methods. \" yet as we've reported, congress, with the support of the white house, has actually cut map funding by more than half since 2010, from $ 221 million down to $ 100 million this year, \" writes propublica's theodoric meyer.

There is something deeply satisfying about seeing an old boss of mine from my mainstream media days embrace niche media. Go fishn is the first site from his new company, go sportn, which will take the same model and create communities for different enthusiast groups much in the way magazines like field &amp; stream used to do. \"i think a mass audience is the ability to address a lot of niches within a category, \" he says. Hmm, where have i heard that before ( cough, nichebusters )? what's even more satisfying is to see him do it so well with a bootstrap budget, five engineers in india, and a few other contractors.

            "Ned desmond has gone fishin ' and he wants you to go fishn too. Today, desmond launched a fishing site for the facebook age. You can sign in with your facebook id, share fishing stories and photos with your friends, ask questions to fishing pros and the community, and review all the gear in your tackle box. Go fishn is an enthusiast site for people who love to fish — and there's an estimated 30 million recreational anglers in the u.s. Alone who spend about $ 45 billion a year on gear, supplies, and trips. \"nobody has done a good job in enthusiast sites, \" says desmond, who is the former president of time interactive and was once my boss ( we launched a magazine together ). There is something deeply satisfying about seeing an old boss of mine from my mainstream media days embrace niche media. Go fishn is the first site from his new company, go sportn, which will take the same model and create communities for different enthusiast groups much in the way magazines like field &amp; stream used to do. \"i think a mass audience is the ability to address a lot of niches within a category, \" he says. Hmm, where have i heard that before ( cough, nichebusters )? what's even more satisfying is to see him do it so well with a bootstrap budget, five engineers in india, and a few other contractors. The whole site was built on rails, mediawiki, and the sphinx open-source search engine. I ' m obviously biased because desmond is my friend, but judge it for yourself.

        "summary": "The self-proclaimed oldest zoo in north america has provided animals to films starring names like adam sandler and seth rogen, but perhaps no bowmanville zoo animal has entered the spotlight like its bengal tiger, which starred in the oscar-winning life of pi. Now the canadian zoo finds itself thrust in the spotlight for a less spectacular reason: owner michael hackenberger has been charged with five counts of animal cruelty some four months after peta released a 90-second video that allegedly captured him whipping a male siberian tiger. The video ( warning: language ) also shows hackenberger swearing at the tiger, named uno. Nbc news reports the ontario society for the prevention of cruelty to animals said it brought the charges after spending \" significant time reviewing the facility and interviewing all involved. \" the ontario spca's statement outlines the charges, which include \" one charge of causing an animal distress by pushing his thumb into the animal's eye. \" hackenberger maintains his innocence but resigned wednesday as director \" until such time as this legal matter is resolved, \" per the zoo's facebook page. Though the hollywood reporter says the video seems to show the tiger being whipped 19 times, a 31-minute video the zoo made in the wake of the peta video has hackenberger saying the vicious whipping was of the air and ground, with the whip actually striking the tiger only three times; on one occasion he says the animal was moving to claw another trainer, per local media. The maximum penalty is a 2-year jail terms and $ 66,000 fine. ( it's not the first set of animal cruelty allegations tied to the film. )",

        "summary": "Women are most likely to develop multiple sclerosis during their childbearing years — after they hit puberty and before menopause. And recent studies show that oral contraceptive use and levels of sex hormones impact a woman's risk, while women who already have the chronic autoimmune disease are less likely to relapse when they're pregnant or breastfeeding, reports the international business times. Now research published in the american academy of neurology journal neurology finds that women who nurse their children for a total of at least 15 months are at a lower risk of developing the disease. In addition to a lower risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, \" this is another example of a benefit to the mother from breastfeeding, \" the study author says in a news release. The team surveyed 397 women who'd recently been diagnosed with ms or its precursor, as well as 433 female control subjects matched for both race and age. Researchers found that women who'd breastfed for at least 15 months were 53 % less likely to develop ms or its precursor compared to women who'd nursed for between zero and four months. The authors stress that they've found a link but didn't establish a cause. They say their findings add to the \" evidence that women who are able to breastfeed their infants should be supported in doing so. \" ( length of nursing matters in this case, too. )",

        "summary": "When murder charges were dropped last month against irish nanny aisling brady mccarthy — who cared for a 1-year-old baby in cambridge, mass., who died of what looked like shaken baby syndrome in 2013 — it was only the second time since 2006 that the state medical examiner changed the manner of death on an autopsy. The other time? another death of a child, just last year, and murder charges were also dropped, reports wbur. And thus the debate over abusive head trauma, which is the medical term for shaken baby syndrome, rages. The question at the center of the larger controversy is whether the \" triad \" of telltale signs — brain swelling, bleeding on the surface of the brain, and retinal hemorrhages — could at times be the result of factors other than shaking, such as infections and even strokes in utero, reports the new york times. In a groundbreaking study conducted recently by the washington post with journalists from northwestern university's medill justice project, 1,600 of the 1,800 child abuse cases involving shaking got a conviction, but 200 ( 1 in 8 ) of those turned out to involve dropped or dismissed charges or defendants who were acquitted or whose convictions were overturned. Even louise woodward, the british nanny who brought shaken baby syndrome into the spotlight when she was famously charged with murder in 1997 in newton, mass., had her charges reduced to involuntary manslaughter. Dr. Patrick barnes, a neuroradiologist and key prosecution witness, rethought his \" adamant \" testimony and is today convinced the diagnosis is often made too readily. Even the pediatrician who first identified the syndrome in 1971 says it is sometimes applied too loosely. Woodward, meanwhile, now has her own baby, reports abc news.

The flick, set in crime-riddled new york city in 1981 and starring jessica chastain, oscar isaac, and albert brooks, has a 91 % approval rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: portraying a heating-oil dealer facing a criminal investigation, isaac \" recalls, without mimicry, the young al pacino, \" joe morgenstern writes at the wall street journal. Director jc chandor \" gives mr. Isaac everything he needs for a tour de force performance, and the actor makes the most of what he gets. \" the film itself is \" ambitious, \" though it \" suffers from a silly ending. \" this \" period drama about the american dream-gone-sour \" builds slowly, chris nashawaty writes at entertainment weekly. But \" it's the kind of uncompromising movie we don't see much of anymore. And it makes you nostalgic for a time when the world was worse and the movies were better. \" chastain's character is a bit cliche as \" the ferociously driven lady macbeth wife, \" nashawaty writes, but chastain adds \" unexpected layers and a fresh twist. \" a most violent year is \" a revelation: meticulously constructed, brilliantly acted, suspenseful, and sharply written, \" writes claudia puig at usa today. Issac and chastain \" give career-topping performances, \" though \" the entire cast is at the top of its game. \" and \" kudos to chandor for writing a lead female character as intriguing as his lead male, something far too rare in tough thrillers. \" to put a damper on this parade, stephanie zacharek at village voice finds the flick \" really just sort of... Dumb. \" she argues it \" isn't nearly as compelling \" as chandor's previous work. \" it's as if he set out to make the godfather, only with heating oil.

        "summary": "Hillary clinton is running for president, but she can still go for a chicken burrito bowl in peace, at least in the toledo suburb of maumee in ohio. Clinton, wearing sunglasses and accompanied by aide huma abedin, carried her own tray and attracted almost no attention at all during the lunch stop at chipotle yesterday, which the restaurant's manager didn't realize had happened until he was contacted by the new york times and reviewed security footage. The manager says employees are \" kicking themselves right now \" and it \" really hurts \" that he never got to meet her, even though he is a republican. The times says it was tipped off about the chipotle visit — and since clinton wasn't recognized at the restaurant, it seems the tip may have come from inside a certain campaign van. In other clinton news: clinton is on a road trip in a van named scooby to iowa, where she ' ll speak at a community college in monticello today and a small-business roundtable near des moines tomorrow, reports usa today, which describes her as the \" front runner for the democratic nomination. \" the reason clinton wasn't noticed in an ohio chipotle may be because she has more fans in baghdad, at least according to a vocativ analysis of her facebook fan statistics. Some 7 % of her fans name baghdad as their hometown, more than any other city, and there are no fewer than four texan cities among the top 10 clinton-supporting cities, according to vocativ, which doesn't offer any explanation for her apparent popularity among iraqis and texans. A campaign source tells the new york daily news that driving instead of flying was clinton's idea, and she has been passing the time catching up on work. \" she first raised the idea of driving to iowa a few weeks ago as a way to get out on the road, enjoy a last few days of being able to have no set schedule, and being able to meet people, \" the source says. With clinton and her team catching up on work, campaign supporters may be able to get some of the concrete details and strategy ideas that they were hoping to receive on sunday or monday, politico reports. \" i can't believe i missed game of thrones for this, \" says one democrat who sat through a conference call for former clinton staffers on sunday night.",

Smith presented his findings at a biblical-literature conference in atlanta, and an abstract of the talk said he planned to \" entertain the possibility that [ the secondary text ] belongs to an otherwise unknown christian apocryphal text. \" what's interesting: smith believes the fragment comes from a scroll, not a codex, unlike every other known sample of greek new testament papyrus. It seems both sides were written by the same hand, so we may have a piece of a scholar's private scroll. That presents a bit of a mystery to a religion professor at princeton university. \" if it was in a personal library, and then the same scribe turned it around to write the other text, what does that mean? \" annemarie luijendijk tells the times. ( see photos of both sides at textual criticism. ) a blog post by papyrus expert brice jones quotes the ebay listing, which stated the fragment belonged to harold willoughby, a \" well-known professor of theology at the university of chicago [ who ] at the time of his death... Had a library of over 3500 rare bibles. \" the seller claims to be related to willoughby, who died in 1962.

Medieval scholarship about arabic translations of the scriptures — jewish, christian, and muslim — continued in the early modern era in the printed editions and was eventually absorbed by biblical textual criticism, as part of the larger field of the history of biblical versions. Modern scholarship, as has been shown, doubted that the study of arabic translations could provide insights into the bible itself. After the early and influential attempts by ignazio guidi and georg graf to reconstitute the genre, scholarship stagnated in the twentieth century, and only recent years have seen something of a revival.

' \" elitzer explains in the official announcement. Adds rubin, \" giving students access to cryptocurrencies is analogous to providing them with internet access at the dawn of the internet era. \" the idea behind this and similar projects: the more people who own and use bitcoin, the more likely the currency is to survive — plus, an infrastructure will theoretically be built, with more businesses figuring out ways to accept bitcoins as payment and students developing bitcoin-related applications. \" getting everyone at mit to start playing with bitcoin … will prompt the mit community to begin thinking seriously about how we can live in an all-digital future, \" a faculty supporter of the project tells mit's the tech. And, as the boston globe points out, mit professors and researchers will be able to study how the currency is used.

The latter company — which deals in mobile payments — began trading publicly for the first time thursday, and shares were trading nearly $ 4 above the $ 9 ipo price. Dorsey, who turned 39 thursday, owns 69.6 million shares, and usa today calculates his windfall to be $ 277 million. The strong trading day for square, combined with other solid debuts from the owner of match.com and the email security firm mimecast, is \" a welcome relief for the beaten-down market for initial public offerings, \" notes the wall street journal. On wednesday, square's unexpectedly low ipo price led to a spate of worrisome headlines and stories about the state of silicon valley, and particularly so-called \" unicorns, \" or startups worth at least $ 1 billion. \" square's financials leave much to be desired, \" one industry analyst tells reuters. \" but there's still a lot to like here, and think the success of their debut will say a lot about the current ipo environment. \" ( in other tech news, tinder's ceo recently gave a cringe-inducing interview. )",

However, the real conspiracy is that her conservative supporters have figured out a way to exploit abc.com's email-voting feature, allowing infinite votes. While bristol palin denies any tea party conspiracy theories, there's no denying that conservatives have been pushing for votes for bristol, using blogs and twitter to start a movement. But what isn't widely known is the evidence — via message board comments on some conservative sites — that this mobilization involves fixing this ( albeit meaningless ) election through a technical snafu on abc's website, which allows palin's supporters to cast an infinite number of email votes: here's a hint: they don't have to be valid email addresses to register them with abc.com, there is apparently no validation process.

Al green of texas read an impeachment resolution wednesday on the house floor, the washington post reports. According to the hill, green introduced impeachment as a privileged resolution, which allows a member of congress to force a vote on it within two legislative days. But when the gop presiding officer moved to consider the impeachment resolution less than an hour later, green was a no-show. While green says he wanted to give fellow democrats a chance to review his resolution and was told it wouldn't be brought up for an immediate vote, multiple democratic aides say green was pressured to drop it by democratic leadership. One democratic aide says the impeachment resolution — which states trump has \" undermined the integrity of his office, \" \" brought disrepute on the presidency, \" and caused \" immediate injury to american society \" — would lead to \" a complicated vote that cannot be easily explained. \" democratic leaders are hesitant to move forward on impeachment, which could alienate liberals or moderates depending on their vote, while investigations into trump are ongoing. Meanwhile, the new york times reports california billionaire tom steyer sent a letter to democratic leaders wednesday demanding lawmakers and candidates support impeachment if they want any more of his money. Steyer is one of the democratic party's biggest donors, having given more than $ 91 million in 2016. He wants to make impeachment a major issue in the 2018 midterms.",

        "summary": "Engineers at apple are developing a technical fix that would make it even harder for the government to break into a locked iphone. Sources tell the new york times the effort began before the san bernardino attack, and therefore well before a federal judge's order that apple unlock an iphone belonging to one of the killers. There's currently a vulnerability created by the phone's native troubleshooting system, which enables apple to update software without the user's passcode being entered. The fix would close that opening; the fbi wants apple to use the opening to shoehorn a way in via new software. The fbi has found itself unable to crack the passcode because iphones are rendered \" permanently inaccessible \" after 10 failed attempts, abc news reports. But the fbi shouldn't hold its breath for that new software. In a wednesday interview with abc, cook calls the proposed software the \" equivalent of cancer, \" adding, \" we would never write it. \" it's not just about a single iphone, he says. \" if we knew a way to do this that would not expose hundreds of millions of other people to issues, we would obviously do it.... Our job is to protect our customers. \" the government, on the other hand, has said cook's resistance is just a marketing ploy. As for apple's alleged in-the-works fix, the times notes a solution that \" defeats the fbi is unworkable if it frustrates consumers. \" telling someone they will lose all their photos because they forgot their passcode \" is a really tough sell, \" says a tech analyst with the aclu.",

        "summary": "A pit bull in texas and her puppies were euthanized as the dog gave birth to the puppies, sparking a social media conversation about the ethics of such a situation. Dacia anderson, a former volunteer at the amarillo-panhandle humane society, which rents space from the animal management and welfare shelter, was doing a walk-through of the shelter in order to take photos for the humane society's facebook album. In a facebook post on may 31, she described seeing the dog before it was euthanized on may 10 and said that it appeared friendly but scared. Later, when she checked on the dog she was in labor, so she talked to staff about getting a proper whelping box for it. When she returned to check on the dog, it was being moved, and she heard later that the dog and her puppies had been put down before the dog had finished giving birth. According to the shelter director, the facility had taken custody of the dog after its owners called 911 to report it as aggressive. \"the following morning, \" he told kamr, \"we ended up euthanizing it due to the nature of the call and the behaviors the animal exhibited. \" he called the actions \" unfortunate \" but \" the right call, \" adding to abc7 that due to the shelter's limited budget, \" we just simply can't save all the animals.... When animals come in with behavior issues, those animals will be ultimately put down. \" anderson disagrees with his account, noting there were no markers on the dog's cage deeming her aggressive. The longtime volunteer says she understands the reality of euthanasia due to overpopulation at shelters, but found this particular situation inhumane and \" horrific, \" she wrote on facebook. \" if this is acceptable to the leadership of the shelter, then what is out of bounds? \"",

Michael zehaf-bibeau, 32, was the son of a quebec businessman who apparently fought with rebels in libya in 2011, according to the globe and mail. A friend who last saw zehaf-bibeau in a british columbia mosque six weeks ago says he had spoken of going to the middle east soon, supposedly only to study islam. More: the friend says zehaf-bibeau seemed disturbed and often spoke of the presence of demons in the world. \" we were having a conversation in a kitchen, and i don't know how he worded it: he said the devil is after him, \" he says. \" i think he must have been mentally ill. \" zehaf-bibeau, who was shot dead inside parliament, had a criminal record, including charges of drug possession and robbery, the cbc reports. He served 60 days in prison for drug possession in quebec in 2004, and after being charged with robbery and uttering threats in bc in 2011, he served 67 days after pleading guilty to the latter charge. Zehaf-bibeau is far from the first home-grown terror suspect in canada, but unlike most others, he doesn't appear to have had a significant internet presence; no twitter or facebook accounts belonging to him have been found, reports the national post. Nathan cirillo, the soldier zehaf-bibeau shot dead at point-blank range at canada's national war memorial, is being mourned as a compassionate man who loved being in the military, reports the toronto star. The 24-year-old from hamilton, ontario, \" was a great dad who always busted his ass for his lil man. Truly lost too soon, \" a friend wrote on a memorial page. Cirillo was shot as he stood next to the tomb of the unknown soldier carrying a ceremonial rifle that wasn't loaded.",

They descended to about 200 feet to get a closer look at the debris. \" we could tell there was a person laying on it, and we circled it three times just to confirm what we were seeing, \" smith tells wpbf.

Some things to know: even if the fed acts, rates might well remain relatively low for years, despite some alarming predictions to the contrary. The upshot explains. But if borrowers are worried about a slow and steady uptick in rates, here is what they can do to insulate themselves, per the wall street journal. Rising rates could affect retirement portfolios in the form of falling bond prices, and cnbc has some advice on what to keep an eye on — along with a collection of other rate-related stories here. After deciding to raise rates, the fed must then figure out exactly how to go about it. It's trickier than usual: the traditional method involving the federal funds rate will be \" too unwieldy \" now, reports the washiington post. Did this move come too late? the los angeles times rounds up some views suggesting the fed has only made things worse.

The development came before a jury was set to begin considering the case against 22-year-old jordan graham. In exchange for the plea to second-degree murder, prosecutors agreed to drop a first-degree murder charge and a count of making a false statement to authorities. First-degree murder means a crime is premeditated. Graham could face a maximum sentence of life in prison on march 27. In accepting the plea, district judge donald molloy told graham to recount exactly what happened the night of july 7 when her husband cody johnson, 25, fell to his death in the park. Graham said she told johnson that she wasn't happy and wasn't feeling like she should after getting married. She said they argued and at one point he grabbed her by the arm. She said she brushed his hand away and pushed him, with one hand on his arm and one on his back. \" i wasn't thinking about where we were... I just pushed, \" she told the judge.

        "summary": "Four states hold republican contests on tuesday and two states choose democrats, but most eyes are on the biggest prize: michigan. It will be the first big industrial state to vote, and analysts say how it votes will be a key indicator of how both the democratic and republican contests will play out in the weeks to come. Mississippi is also holding gop and democratic votes, while republicans alone are voting in hawaii and idaho. A roundup of coverage: fortune takes a close look at all four gop races and predicts wins for donald trump in mississippi and idaho, with ted cruz a possibility in hawaii. John kasich is polling strongly in michigan, and wins for either him or trump will set them up nicely for a crucial victory in ohio a week from now. How well trump does in michigan will tell us a lot about his staying power in the race, according to philip bump at the washington post. Trump has a double-digit lead in the polls and the state is economically stressed, which tends to produce trump voters, he notes. But if there is a late surge toward cruz as seen in louisiana, that could be a sign that trump's lead isn't safe anywhere. On the democratic side, hillary clinton and bernie sanders crisscrossed michigan on monday before appearing at a town hall event in detroit, the guardian reports. Clinton, who has targeted sanders'stance on the auto bailout, has a 13-point lead in the state, according to the latest monmouth university poll. Victory would be a huge boost for sanders, though he has vowed to remain in the race whatever happens. Politico looks at john kasich's possible route to the nomination, which supporters describe as very tough and rivals describe as fantasy. According to fivethirtyeight's analysis, clinton has a greater than 99 % chance of winning in both michigan and mississippi. Trump, meanwhile, has a 92 % chance of taking michigan, while marco rubio's odds have shrunk from 34 % a few weeks ago to under 1 % now. The ap recommends viewers keep an eye not just on winners, but on margins of victory should clinton and trump both win — and on whether they target rivals or each other in their victory speeches. Another thing to watch for: whether exit margins show that sanders has been able to win over many minority voters. Trump spent monday in mississippi, where he talked to the clarion-ledger about the economy and about his \" tremendous relationship \" with black voters.",

        "summary": "Another state of the union address is in the books, and you know what that means: time for pundits to assemble random observations and analysis into \" takeaway \" lists! here are some of our favorite reactions this morning: the boehner card: how do you get republicans to applaud? flatter them. Obama showed \" a deftness he either didn't possess or chose not to wield in years past, \" chris cillizza at the washington post writes, by using john boehner as an example of the american dream. The belief that hard work should pay off is \" how the son of a barkeep is speaker of the house, \" obama said. What was left unsaid: you can tell obama thinks immigration reform is actually possible, because he said almost nothing about it. By avoiding any specific demands, obama made it easier for house leaders to forge a compromise, carrie dann at nbc news observes. Cillizza adds that his language — \" i know both parties in the house \" will act — was \" an olive branch extension if ever we've heard one. \" the campaign is on: but it wasn't all bipartisanship. Obama also effectively laid out a 2014 campaign platform for democrats, with bumper sticker slogans like, \" give america a raise. \" democrats think the minimum wage issue in particular is a winner, and with good reason, politico points out; recent polls show that three-quarters of the country support a hike. Obama's done apologizing for obamacare: the president's health care defense was so combative that it \" could have been written by harry reid or nancy pelosi, \" writes frank james at npr. \" let's not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping millions of americans, \" he said, challenging republicans to come up with solutions of their own. Think small: most of obama's concrete proposals were pretty modest, dann notes. Improving broadband access, reforming federal training programs, and creating \" myras \" ( a term, npr notes, that obama had trouble spitting out ), \" aren't exactly sexy, even if they could positively impact many americans ' lives. \" forget congress: perhaps the most hyped aspect of obama's speech was his new focus on executive orders.the not-so-subtle message, according to politico: \" republicans stalled my agenda in 2013, perhaps the worst year of my presidency. You think i ' m going to sit by and let you do it again? \"",

It's just a theory at this point, and earthsky points out two issues: \" first, their proposal goes against the predictions of current models on the formation of the solar system, which state that there are no other planets moving in circular orbits beyond neptune. \" ( the astronomers suggest other research is disproving this anyway. ) and second, the study sample of just 13 objects is small.

Us district judge andrew hanen decided that a lawsuit led by texas and joined by 25 other states satisfied legal requirements, reports the new york times. \" the court finds that the government's failure to secure the border has exacerbated illegal immigration into this country, \" which \" significantly drains the states'resources, \" he wrote, calling failure to enforce immigration laws \" both dangerous and unconscionable \" and temporarily suspending programs that could defer deportation for around 5 million people. The ruling was hailed by texas officials, including republican gov. Greg abbott, who said it had checked \" the president's attempt to bypass the will of the american people, \" reports the los angeles times. But supporters of obama's immigration order say the ruling is just the first step in a long legal battle, and legal scholars tell the new york times that an appeals court is almost certain to lift hanen's ruling. The judge, who has been on the federal bench since 2002, was assigned the immigration case through an automated system, reports the ap, which notes that hanen wasn't known for being outspoken on immigration until a case in 2013, when he accused the federal government of taking part in a \" criminal conspiracy \" by reuniting a child smuggled from el salvador with her mother, who was in the us illegally.",

Researchers also found that cats appeared to offer some protection, but the link wasn't as strong. Babies who lived in households with dogs were healthier and had fewer ear infections than babies without a dog in the home, according to a study in pediatrics by finnish researchers. Jennifer corbett dooren has details on lunch break. ( photo: getty images ) the study, posted online monday and based on 397 children who lived in rural and suburban parts of finland, examined whether contact with dogs and cats during a baby's first year offers any protection from respiratory tract infections, such as colds and resulting common ear infections. \" the children having dogs at home were healthier, they had less ear infections and they needed less antibiotics, \" said eija bergroth, the study's lead author and a pediatrician affiliated with kuopio university hospital in kuopio, finland.

            "Dogs may protect babies from some infections: study washington — babies who spend time around pet dogs have fewer ear infections and respiratory ailments than those whose homes are animal-free, said a study released on monday. The study, published in the us journal pediatrics, did not say why but suggested that being around a dog that spends at least part of its day outdoors may boost a child's immune system in the first year of life. Cats, too, seemed to convey some protection to babies, though the effect observed was weaker than with dogs. The research was based on 397 children in finland whose parents made diary entries each week recording the state of their child's health during the infant's first year, from nine weeks to 52 weeks of age. Overall, babies in homes with cats or dogs were about 30 percent less likely to have respiratory infectious symptoms -- which included cough, wheezing, rhinitis ( stuffy or runny nose ) and fever -- and about half as likely to get ear infections. \" if children had dog or cat contacts at home, they were significantly healthier during the study period, \" said the study led by experts at kuopio university hospital in finland.

        "summary": "The first of six trials in the death of freddie gray — who suffered a broken neck while in police custody last april — got underway wednesday in baltimore, the washington post reports. Officer william porter is charged with involuntary manslaughter, assault, misconduct in office, and reckless endangerment. Five other officers have also been charged in connection with the 25-year-old's death. According to the new york times, prosecutors for the state claim porter ignored gray's pleas that he couldn't breathe and requests for a medic or to go to the hospital. They accuse porter of \" criminal negligence \" and \"gross indifference to whether mr. Gray survived. \" the post reports officers are trained to get help for any arrestee who says they can't breathe. Meanwhile porter's attorney claims gray never said he couldn't breathe around porter, the times reports. According to the post, the defense also points to gray's history of resisting arrest and the habit of arrestees in general of faking injuries to get out of going to jail. His attorney told the jury they may want to find porter guilty to \" hold someone accountable, \" but the facts don't support it and it would be a \" tragedy. \" gray broke his neck while inside a police van, where he was not buckled in. How he broke his neck and the fact that he wasn't wearing a seat belt are both points of contention between the prosecution and defense. Gray went into a coma before reaching the jail and died a week later. The times reports his death led to the worst riots in baltimore since martin luther king jr. Was killed 47 years earlier.",

If it resumes, thousands of people are expected to head west and end up in the syrian province of idlib near the turkish border. The problem? the same thing that happened to aleppo might happen to idlib next. The region is the last anti-government stronghold, and now that president bashar al-assad has essentially reclaimed aleppo, he is expected to continue his push to oust opposition forces. In fact, idlib already has been hit with regular government airstrikes in recent weeks, reports cnn. \"i don't know what will happen in idlib, but if there is no cease-fire or political accord then it will become the next aleppo, \" says the un envoy for syria, per the new york times. Given its location, idlib has strategic importance to both assad ( giving him control of the \" damascus to aleppo highway \" ) and to turkey, which opposes his regime, notes the international business times.
