        "summary": "The iran nuclear deal appears good to go following announcements of support from three democratic senators today in what the hill is calling an \" impressive lobbying win \" for president obama and the white house. Those three senators bring the total votes for the deal to 41 in the senate, meaning republicans don't have the numbers to pass a resolution against it. All 54 senate republicans were joined by four democrats — including a west virginia senator who officially sided with them today — in supporting a resolution to stop the deal, cnn reports. It would have likely been a moot point, anyway, as obama already had the votes to veto any resolution passed against his deal. Floor debate on the deal begins today. While today's announcements were supportive, they weren't necessarily ringing endorsements of obama's plan. \"despite my serious concerns with this agreement, i have unfortunately become convinced that we are faced with no viable alternative, \" one of the three senators, gary peters of michigan, tells the hill. \" while this is not the agreement i would have accepted at the negotiating table, it is better than no deal at all, \" another of the senators, richard blumenthal of connecticut, tells cnn. The three senators made their announcements on the same day dick cheney called the iran nuclear deal \" madness. \" ted cruz and donald trump are expected to headline a rally against it tomorrow.",

The insiders say flynn told the transition team's chief lawyer on jan. 4 that he had been secretly working as a lobbyist for turkey while advising trump on national security issues during his campaign. He was hired in august by a turkish businessman. Trump campaign officials — and the justice department — became suspicious after flynn wrote an election day op-ed in the hill criticizing a foe of the turkish government. The justice department investigation of flynn's turkey links is separate from the fbi investigation of his ties to russia, an investigation that president trump allegedly asked former fbi chief james comey to drop, slate notes. Flynn was paid more than $ 500,000 for his work representing turkish interests, and mcclatchy reports that just 10 days into the trump administration, flynn rejected a plan that would have involved kurdish forces helping to retake raqqa, the de facto isis capital in syria. The rejection, which was what turkey wanted, halted an operation that had been months in the making. Trump revived the raqqa plan weeks after flynn was fired.

One might think, then, that aaron hernandez's case of cte is just another one. Not so. Hernandez's diagnosis \" will shake the nfl to its core.

Long odds: hernandez's family sued the nfl and the new england patriots for $ 20 million on thursday, saying they did not protect hernandez from the dangers of the game. The case would be difficult to win, a legal expert tells the boston globe. But he adds that the league and team may want to settle in order to avoid turning over related documents.

A group for elderly people likewise calls it \" unnecessary and undesirable, \" reports the ap. Almost 4 % of dutch deaths in 2015 came under the euthanasia law, expanded since 2012 to include those suffering from certain mental illnesses and dementia. Still, \" the cabinet is of the opinion that a request for help ( in dying ) from people who suffer unbearably and have no hope without an underlying medical reason can be a legitimate request, \" the ministers say. The proposed law will lay out the need for checks, reviews, and supervision and will be vetted by a \" death assistance provider, \" the health minister adds.

Officials say the administration was on track to receive more than 7 million signups, in line with the original congressional budget office target numbers. That target had earlier been shrunk to 6 million following healthcare.gov's troubled debut, the ap notes. Still, among the 7 million, it's uncertain how many had previously lacked any coverage; it also remains to be seen how many new enrollees complete the process by actually paying their first premiums. \" it's kind of the lead-up to christmas right now, and all the last-minute shoppers are out, \" one health insurance marketer tells the huffington post of yesterday's flurry of new enrollees. The huge volume resulted in headaches and came amid site glitches, as healthcare.gov struggled to keep up with traffic that at times topped 125,000 simultaneous visitors. The 7 million milestone is particularly impressive given the meager 26,000 the website managed to sign up in its first month, nbc news notes. Those who missed yesterday's deadline — and haven't qualified for one of nine extensions and exceptions to the rules — won't get another chance at open enrollment until november.",

The 42-year-old activist left a detention centre in the south of moscow in the early hours of sunday morning and went to a waiting car. \"over the 50 days i have been in jail we have seen yet more evidence that this regime is in complete decline, \" he said, referring to recent embarrassments to moscow's intelligence services abroad and the launch failure of a manned russian space rocket. \"if anyone thinks that with arrests... They can scare or stop us, that is clearly not the case. \" authorities have turned up the heat on vladimir putin's top critic since the russian president's approval ratings took a beating over deeply unpopular pension reforms. Navalny finished a 30-day sentence in september for organising a rally at the start of the year but was arrested as soon as he was released to face further charges over another protest. Communist challenger exposes cracks in putin's grip on power read more the latter demonstration, against the raising of the retirement age, was timed to coincide with regional elections in september. The kremlin suffered rare defeats in those polls, with voters rejecting candidates from the ruling united russia party in at least two regions. A run-off in the far-eastern primorsky krai will be held again in two months after accusations of vote-rigging in favour of the moscow-backed candidate led to protests. The navalny ally leonid volkov said at the time of the latest arrest that the kremlin had \"to take it out on someone because of all their defeats and failures of the last weeks \". Supporters fear that the two consecutive administrative cases mean the authorities may be getting ready to open a criminal case against navalny. In that case he could face a lengthy prison term.

        "summary": "The last of the hobbit films is now playing in theaters, bringing with it an end to peter jackson's long foray through jrr tolkien's middle-earth ( at least for now ). How does the finale of the second trilogy compare to its predecessors? here's what critics are saying about the hobbit: the battle of the five armies: \" entertaining? absolutely, \" writes john wenzel at the denver post. The film starts off with \" one of the most tense and spectacular openings in action-film history. \" but soon, fans \" may feel a bit lost, \" as if the movie was \" somehow slapped together in a series of last-minute editing decisions. \" it's also clear that it's \" far removed from its modest source material. \" it could be worse, though. Overall, \" it still manages to work on a surprising number of levels. \" peter jackson continues to struggle with turning \" one none-too-thick book... Into three overly long movies, \" writes tom long at the detroit news. \" the result is a great deal of noise serving as filler. \" jackson \" seems to have lost much of the visual imagination that kept his lord of the rings trilogy engaging. \" long summarizes the flick like so: \" orcs screaming, elves looking shiny, dwarves wielding hammers, battle, battle. \" joe morgenstern, however, finds the film awe-inspiring. Sure, much of it \" could qualify as an animated feature, \" he writes at the wall street journal, but \" the computer-generated effects here are executed so gorgeously... And intertwined with such stirring live action, that the film as a whole is seamless, quite astonishing, and deeply satisfying. \" if you didn't watch first two movies, \" the closing chapter isn't worth sitting through the 330 minutes ' worth of movie that preceded it, \" writes rene rodriguez at the miami herald. Though in rodriguez's view, the trilogy's final film is its best: it has an actual sense of \" real life-and-death consequences, \" and the acting is even better. It's \" fleet, rousing entertainment \" with \" cgi effects that raise the bar on the fantasy genre, \" he says. \" mr. Jackson, you proved your point by landing the finish. Now please, no more middle-earth, ever. \"",

Marty balin, who co-founded jefferson airplane and played on and off with its later iteration, jefferson starship, died en route to the hospital in tampa, florida, at age 76, reports the new york times. The cause of death wasn't immediately known. The times calls balin a \" prime mover in the flowering of psychedelic rock in mid-1960s san francisco, \" not only through the band he co-founded in 1965 but through a nightclub he owned called the matrix. Rolling stone has a detailed obituary on balin's interesting career, noting that he was a struggling folk guitarist when he met another guitarist named paul kantner and decided to form a band. Other original airplane members were guitarist jorma kaukonen, bassist jack casady, drummer skip spence, and singer signe toly anderson, but the band didn't truly take off until anderson left and was replaced by grace slick in 1967, notes rolling stone. Balin wrote or co-wrote many of the songs, and his \" high and soulful \" voice became a signature sound for the group, per variety. ( here is \" comin ' back to me. \" ) but he was also a savvy businessman, as this old quote from the late kanter shows: \"he was the leader of the band on that level.

Podcast host sarah fraser asked fox 5 dc morning co-anchors holly morris and allison seymour if they thought it was \" a little ridiculous \" micheal brown threw his hat in the ring for 20 schools, which fraser believes yanked spots away from other teens who'd be waitlisted. Morris agreed it was \" ridiculous \" and also \" obnoxious, \" because \" you can only take one full ride and you are taking a spot from someone else who works really hard. \" seymour tried to point out that scholarships from schools brown eventually turns down — his first choice is stanford, though with harvard, yale, princeton, and other esteemed schools in the mix, he hasn't made up his mind yet — will go \" back into the pot. \" huffpost notes that many online were angered by the journos'takes, with some saying their comments may have been racially motivated, as brown is black. Fraser has since apologized to brown ( he accepted ), calling their remarks \" petty \" and insisting brown is \" awesome. \" morris clarified on twitter she just believes in a more \" targeted search \" for colleges; she also conducted a skype interview with brown, which he says was \" respectful, \" but he adds he won't give permission for it to air until he gets an apology from the station. \" where's the #humandecency?, \" he tweeted last week.",

Hill was driving liz willock from the philadelphia airport to her hotel last week when willock mentioned that she knew someone competing in the olympics. Hill then mentioned his son — but when willock asked whether the proud father would be traveling to brazil to watch, the uber driver said he couldn't afford the trip. That's when willock went into action, setting up a gofundme campaign to raise the estimated $ 7,500 hill would need for travel, lodging, food, and other expenses. Hill's son, darrell, shared it on social media, and within two days, the money had been raised. Willock works for a global concierge service, and her company is helping arrange hill's travel and logistics, nbc 10 reports. Uber even gave hill a $ 1,000 ride credit for getting around in rio, plus a $ 250 gift certificate for a meal at one of the best restaurants in the city. ( in all, $ 8,200 was raised on gofundme, and donations have now been disabled. ) darrell hill got his dad tickets to his event next thursday, but the elder hill still needs a passport ( he has never traveled outside of the us before ), so willock is helping him get one expedited. She believes it will come through by the time his flight leaves aug. 15: \" there's been a lot of magic through this whole process, \" she says. \" it's really meant to be, i believe. \"",

She finally broke into an empty park ranger cabin, where she was rescued saturday. After a mini-trek themselves, her husband and son had been able to get cellphone service and call for help.

Beijing's air pollution has gotten so bad — hitting red alert for the first time ever last week, prompting school and factory closures and restricting traffic for days, reports weather.com — that some residents are not only staying indoors and wearing masks, they're buying fresh air in canisters from canada. Vitality air co-founder moses lam tells the new york daily news that it all started on a whim in november 2014, when friends put a ziploc baggie of air on ebay to see if it would sell. It did, and they figured if companies can bottle and distribute natural spring water, why not good old-fashioned air, too? vitality air was born, and employees began to trek out to the mountains around banff, canada, sit around with open bottles for 10 hours, and then head back to headquarters in edmonton to bottle and mail the goods. They sell 7.7 liters, or as many as 200 breaths of fresh air, for $ 15, or roughly 100 yuan — which could fetch 50 bottles of mineral water — and recently sold 500 bottles across china in less than two weeks. A professor at polytechnic university tells cnn that buyers are probably fooling themselves. \" we need to filter out the particles, the invisible killers, from the air, \" he says. \" one bottle of air wouldn't help. I would be very cautious. \" still, vitality air's china rep tells the telegraph that the company has found a niche market in affluent women, who tend to buy for their families and as gifts for friends. Other customers include nightclubs and retirement homes. The bottles are clearly not considered, ahem, gag gifts. ( check out the latest type of bottled water, infused with fat. )",

She was in the hip-hop group mercedes ladies at the time, and he had invited her to check out his new offices. \"the next thing i knew, he was pinning me down and i was trying to fight him and he had his way, \" she tells the la times. \"i left crying. \" music journalist tony sallie went on a few dates with simmons and stayed friendly with him. In 1988, she says simmons invited her to a party at his apartment, but she was all alone when she got there and he raped her. \" he pushed me on the bed and jumped on top of me, and physically attacked me, \" sallie tells the ny times. Lisa kirk says simmons, who she knew through a former boyfriend, tried to assault her at a club in 1988, following her into the women's restroom and pushing her into a stall. \"i smashed into the wall, \" she tells the la times. \"it tore my clothes. \" kirk says simmons ran off after he saw her looking at him. Singer tina baker says simmons raped her in the early 90s when he was her manager after inviting her to his apartment to talk about her career. \" i didn't sing for almost a year, \" she tells the ny times. \" i went into oblivion. \" drew dixon describes \" prolonged and aggressive sexual harassment \" at the hands of simmons while she was an executive at def jam recordings culminating in her rape in 1995 at the age of 24.

Google is also seeking ways to keep its other operations in china going, although some executives fear that a backlash from the chinese authorities could make it almost impossible to keep a presence in the country. When the search giant first promised to end censorship in response to what it claimed were a series of cyber-attacks mounted from inside china, many china-watchers warned that its public defiance of",

We used heritrix ( 3.1.1-snapshot ) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives. The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites. However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed urls to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the urls for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl ( and therefore we never got to them ). We also included repeated crawls of some argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed.

        "summary": "For tens of thousands of years, where humans go, animals are driven to extinction. We are the superpredator, killing animals — and adults ones at that — at a much higher rate than other predators. And it's not sustainable. So say researchers at the university of victoria in the journal science after examining more than 300 studies and 2,125 predator-prey interactions on both land and sea to learn how much the adult population of their prey dwindles in a given year. They found that humans \" kill adult prey at much higher median rates than other predators ( up to 14 times higher ). \" removing so many animals in their reproductive prime has implications for future populations, both in terms of raw numbers that can survive and how species evolve to handle this extreme predation. \" we predicted that there would be difference, but we were surprised by the magnitude of that difference, \" lead author chris darimont tells the los angeles times. He goes on to call our hunting strategy \" problematic, \" as we tend to kill adults while other predators naturally tend to target the \" younger, smaller, weaker members of a species.... Typically, human hunters remove one in 5 large carnivores from the planet each year, and... Most large carnivores do not have the reproductive ability to withstand that sort of mortality. \" but not everyone is ready to toss in the rifle and rod. \" i think it's total rubbish, \" one ecologist tells science magazine. In fishing, for instance, the human haul accounts for 40 % of total natural predation, which is reasonable for feeding our huge population. Fishing less, in his view, is not an option, thus this new study is \" fuzzing up what we mean by sustainability. \" ( are fish evolving to escape our nets? )",

            "A new study drives home the destructive power of our species. Not only do we kill other animals at much higher rates than other predators, but our ability to bring down larger adults can make it very difficult for some prey populations to recover. This superpredator status may fill our bellies, but it has darker implications. \" any predator capable of exerting such impact will eventually drive its prey to extinction, \" warns gerardo ceballos, an ecologist at the national autonomous university of mexico in mexico city. It's happened before. About 14,000 years ago, humans entering north america caused many large species, such as the mammoth, to disappear. And our hunting technologies have only improved since then, particularly when it comes to catching fish. Overfishing is a severe problem in some parts of the world, and a recent report concludes that because of human activity, more than 90 fish species are at risk of extinction. The new study originated in a casual observation. Thomas reimchen, an evolutionary ecologist at the university of victoria in canada, has spent years studying how predators impact the stickleback fish on an island 130 kilometers off the canadian pacific coast. Over the decades he determined that each species never kills more than 2 % of the sticklebacks per year and usually attacks juveniles. Yet off that same island, fishermen seemed to be taking a far higher percentage of salmon, mostly adults. The contrast bothered him, so reimchen and a few former students searched the scientific literature for data on the rate at which humans and other animals were killing other species. After a decade compiling and analyzing about 300 studies, the team came to some grim conclusions, says chris darimont, a conservation scientist also at the university of victoria who helped lead the study. Humans and other predators — like lions, wolves, and grizzly bears — kill wild herbivores at about the same rate, but humans kill large carnivores at nine times the rate of other predators, darimont, reimchen, and their colleagues report today in science",
            "An anomalous and unbalanced predator in the past century, humans have become the dominant predator across many systems. The species that we target are thus far in considerable decline; however, predators in the wild generally achieve a balance with their prey populations such that both persist. Darimont et al. Found several specific differences between how humans and other predatory species target prey populations ( see the perspective by worm ). In marine environments, for example, we regularly prey on other predator species. These differences may contribute to our much larger ecological impact when compared with other predators.

A quarter of respondents in a new consumer reports study admitted that they \"alter personally identifiable information, \" such as birthdate, on facebook. Technically, that's a violation of the social networking site's terms of service, the new york times points out. And more than twice as many people are doing it now as were two years ago, when the same question was asked. Most of those surveyed said they protected their privacy by adjusting various settings, while almost 20 % said they didn't do anything to protect their privacy. Consumer reports says the increase in people who lie is proof that users are becoming more wary of facebook, and the organization's advocacy arm is urging facebook, via a petition, to strengthen its privacy controls. The consumer reports study also found that a large number of facebook users revealed information on the site that could hurt them, including their whereabouts on a particular day or health information.",

        "summary": "Apple recently opened a \" secret laboratory \" in taiwan, bloomberg reports, though no logos or apple signage underscore that fact on the outside of the building in longtan. Guards and a receptionist provided no information on what goes on inside the building; neither did workers outside on a smoke break. And an apple spokesperson refused to comment. So what is going on in this mysterious apple outpost? sadly it seems it's just a bunch of engineers working on the next generation of ipad and iphone screens. Sources speaking anonymously tell bloomberg the laboratory contains at least 50 workers trying to make brighter and more energy-efficient screens that are thinner and weigh less than the current ones. By developing its own screens, apple would no longer have to rely on technologies from other companies, such as sharp and samsung. Macworld reports this makes sense, since apple wants to have as much control over its hardware as possible. In addition to better displays, smaller screens could also mean more room for much-demanded longer-lasting batteries. Perhaps coincidentally, though in that vein, the washington post notes a new rumor that apple is coming out with a new generation of smaller iphones, possibly due in march.",

But quite a few people are less than pleased that mccarthy has been given such a huge platform from which to air her well-known belief that childhood vaccines cause autism, the los angeles times reports. One author and critic describes mccarthy as \" a homicidal maniac \" and the view audience as \" impressionable \" moms with young kids — a bad combination, in his opinion. Indeed, when mccarthy's hiring was rumored, at least two anti-mccarthy letter-writing campaigns to abc were organized, and both left- and right-leaning media decried her as a threat to public health. Clearly, the efforts were in vain. After mccarthy was confirmed, twitter exploded with snark; the hollywood reporter has a roundup of reactions.",

On monday, navy chief john richardson took the rare step of ordering an \" operational pause \" in naval operations around the world so fleet commanders can assess what's going on, reports the navy times. Richardson, who pronounced himself \" heartbroken \" over the latest disaster, also ordered a broader investigation that goes beyond the details of the latest incidents and gets at the \" root causes \" of the problems. \" this is the second collision in three months and is the last in a series of incidents in the pacific theater, \" he said. \" this trend demands more forceful action. \" coverage: the collision: the uss john s. Mccain, a destroyer, collided with an oil tanker off the coast of singapore as it prepared to enter a port there. The collision happened just before dawn in one of the world's most congested shipping lanes, reports the new york times. Things can get confusing in a hurry, especially in the dark. Protocol: there should have been plenty of crew members on deck looking for the lights of nearby ships, and, given the congestion, it wouldn't have been unusual for the ship's commander to be on the bridge, too. \" clearly at some point, the bridge team lost situational awareness, \" says adm. William f. Moran, vice chief of naval operations, per the washington post. Out of position? the accident happened on the eastern approach to the strait of singapore, and afp quotes one naval expert from jane's who says, based on early reports, that the naval ship may not have been in the proper position, a possible sign of crew fatigue. The strait is only 10 miles wide, not leaving much room for error. It's a \" dynamic environment \" requiring extra vigilance, says one marine insurance official. Fourth this year: this is the fourth accident involving a us navy ship in asian waters this year, and cnn has details on all of them. The other big one, of course, was a june collision involving the uss fitzgerald that left seven sailors dead. Prior to that, a south korean fishing ship hit the uss lake champlain, and the us antietam ran aground off japan. A list at the new york times goes back further.

The app companies there say more than 80 % of their single-rider users are saudi women, per the times, while a regional gm for uber notes that the number of users in the kingdom has multiplied by 20 since the company ventured in last year. Technically there's no law prohibiting women from driving in the kingdom, but because of cleric-issued fatwas, women can't get driver's licenses, the times notes. Other reasons conservatives spout for not letting women get behind the wheel in the gender-segregated state range from their ovaries getting damaged to increased chance of rape if their cars break down to coming into contact with male medical staff after car accidents. So ride-sharing it is, for now, for working women stuck in the system. That includes radwan, who coughs up $ 700 or so a month to careem to get back and forth to her marketing job. She says the gps technology in careem's cars makes them safer than taxis, and no one can tell she's not in a private vehicle — important since women using public transportation solo in saudi arabia are also seen as \" lacking morals, \" the times notes.",

        "summary": "The archdiocese of chicago has released more than 6,000 pages of internal documents showing decades of hidden sexual abuse by 30 priests. Priests accused of abuse still received promotions, while alleged victims faced church-backed investigations, the chicago sun-times reports. The church moved accused priests between parishes and left abuse unreported; most of the men were never prosecuted, the chicago tribune notes. None of the 30 priests, 14 of whom have died, are currently in the ministry, the archdiocese says. No allegations in the documents, released following a lawsuit, occurred after 1996, it adds — though some allegations came to light during the tenure of current cardinal francis george, the tribune notes. The vicar general of the third-largest archdiocese in the us says the church didn't try to cover up the abuse, though he acknowledged that the institution made mistakes, the sun-times notes. Among the cases noted by the newspapers: despite abuse accusations, cardinals john cody and joseph bernardin let vincent mccaffrey, who eventually admitted abusing more than a dozen people between 1976 and 1990, stay in the priesthood, switching between parishes; he was finally defrocked in 2010. Mccaffrey received a 20-year sentence for child pornography. Father robert becker also got a transfer following allegations; he was accused of attacks involving another priest, kenneth ruge. Becker was accused of abusing three siblings. Robert mayer was appointed pastor even after several allegations emerged. The church board of vicars backed the appointment. Following allegations of child abuse, cardinal john cody wrote to the rev. Raymond skriba in 1970: \" i feel that this whole matter should be forgotten by you as it has been forgotten by me … no good can come of trying to prove or disprove the allegations. \"",

The walkout was conceived by an anonymous adjunct at san jose state university in october, the site notes. Now it's all over social media, from tumblr to twitter to facebook. The chronicle of higher education notes that the event's title is misleading: it's more about spreading awareness than actually striking. Supporters will be distributing literature, holding protests, and talking to lawmakers. Students aren't aware of the challenges adjuncts face, says a yeshiva university history professor, and \" until very recently, full-time tenured faculty members did not know how bad off the adjuncts on their campuses were. \" some are on food stamps, she says. Adds a penn state professor to the kansas city star: \" many of them are working at or under the poverty line, without health insurance; they have no academic freedom worthy of the name because they can be fired at will. \" from southern california to boston, some have begun to form unions, while workers at universities across the country ( and beyond ) are announcing plans to get out the message today. \" it is absolutely a national movement, \" says a lecturer.",

Yup, human litter can be found even in the most far-reaching places on the planet, according to one of the biggest scientific surveys ever done of the seafloor. Using video and trawling surveys between 1999 and 2011, scientists analyzed 32 sites in the atlantic ocean, arctic ocean, and mediterranean sea. They found everything from bottles to plastic bags, clothing, and fishing nets — even more than 1,200 miles from land and nearly three miles below the water's surface, the guardian reports. Not a single site was litter-free. That means your garbage is on continental shelves, ocean ridges, and deep canyons — the worst spot for garbage build-up, the study says. Plastic was most common at 41 % of the garbage found, while 34 % was related to fishing — think nets and lines. Also spotted: wood, pottery, glass, paper, cardboard, and even burnt coal residue left from steam ships more than 100 years ago. \" this survey has shown that human litter is present in all marine habitats, from beaches to the most remote and deepest parts of the oceans, \" a researcher says. \" most of the deep sea remains unexplored by humans and these are our first visits to many of these sites, but we were shocked to find that our rubbish has got there before us. \" smithsonian notes some 14 billion pounds of garbage enter the oceans each year, some of which animals eat, get tangled in, and often die.",

Our trash is everywhere. Around 14 billion pounds of litter makes its way into the world's oceans every year. Some is created when fishing gear is lost.

Section 4 dictates which parts of the country must receive pre-clearance before election laws can be changed there ( more on that below ). \"section 4's formula is unconstitutional in light of current conditions, \" chief justice john roberts wrote. \"coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradicated practices. \" so in a nutshell, it will fall to congress to come up with a new formula based"

After a lengthy investigation over the february incident, authorities arrested angela blackwell on monday and charged her with homicide by child abuse for her \" extreme indifference to human life. \" her older son has been removed from her care, though the child's father, jeff lewis, contends that his common-law wife, who he says is mentally disabled, is not responsible. \" she's always good to the kids, \" adds lewis ' father, who got to hold his grandchild for a couple hours in the first days of baby william's short life. The magistrate was not allowed to set bond because blackwell's charge carries a sentence of up to life in prison, so she remains in custody until a november bond hearing before a circuit court judge. Records show that lewis, who is 35, has been convicted of shoplifting and larceny dating back to 2005 and spent more than two years in prison, reports abc news. An image of lewis with blackwell in 2012 on heavy.com shows him with several tattoos, including what appears to be a swastika on his forearm. \" i think it's all bull ( expletive ), \" he tells wsoc. \" she didn't do nothing to cause it to die. \" multiple family members say there were many people in the house the night of the baby's death and that another young child with autism may have put william in the refrigerator. ( these parents were allowed to visit their abused baby before she was taken off life support. )",

        "summary": "It's tough enough being on the shorter side, and a new study in the new england journal of medicine doesn't make things any easier. Researchers in the uk find that being small of stature increases the risk of coronary heart disease, the telegraph reports. More specifically, for every 2.5 inches shorter we are, our risk increases by 13.5 %. In other words, a five-foot tall person has a 32 % higher risk of heart disease than a five-foot-six person does. The findings, which involved data on 200,000 people, are tied to genetics; it seems the genes involved in height could also be involved in heart disease. \" the more height-increasing genetic variants that you carry, the lower your risk of coronary heart disease — and conversely, if you were genetically shorter, the higher your risk, \" a researcher notes. That is, at least if you're a man, npr reports: researchers didn't discover a clear relationship between height and heart disease risk in women, though that might just be because the study involved more male than female subjects. Experts have been aware of an apparent relationship between height and heart disease since the 1950s without being able to explain it, npr notes. In fact, the new york times reports that researchers didn't take the idea that the two were linked very seriously, making these findings a surprise. \" this idea that shorter stature is associated with coronary artery disease is something we would laugh about, \" notes one scientist. Another expert still has doubts, telling the times that the connection appears \" weak. \" and on the plus side for short men, a study last year found they live longer.",

        "summary": "When a mysterious crater was discovered this past summer on the yamal peninsula in northern siberia, origin theories abounded, including it being the work of extraterrestrials, a man-made hoax, a meteorite, or the result of a stray missile colliding with the surface of the earth. Now that it's cold enough to venture in, a team of scientists organized by the russian centre of arctic exploration lowered themselves into the crater last week and began the hunt for answers, reports national geographic. \" yamal \" means \" end of the world \" in russian. The current working theory is that the crater, which is 260 feet wide and 54 feet deep, formed after the release of gas hydrates, and scientists will begin testing that theory now. Researchers performed radiolocation tests as deep as 650 feet and took samples of ice, earth, gases, and air from the largest of three known holes, all of which appear to have formed recently. Once they've processed the information from the expedition, the scientists \" plan to explore the surrounding area, comparing images from space, and even those taken in the 1980s, to understand if there are — or were — some similar objects, \" one researcher tells the siberian times. ( one geophysicist in alaska thinks climate change plays a role in the formation of these holes. )",

Images captured by state television showed journalists and onlookers turn to look toward the first shots, then the rows of marchers broke as soldiers and civilians sought cover under sustained gunfire. \" oh god! go go go! lie down! lie down! \" one man screamed as a woman fled with her baby. In the aftermath, paramedics tended to the wounded as soldiers, some bloodied in their dress uniforms, helped their comrades to ambulances. The state-run irna news agency said the attack killed 24 people and wounded 53, citing \" knowledgeable sources \" without elaborating. It said gunmen wore guard uniforms and targeted a riser where military and police commanders were"

Authorities say that alexandre cazes is believed to have hanged himself in his holding cell in thailand after his arrest earlier this month, reports the bangkok post. As the sydney morning herald explains, cazes is reputed to be a co-founder of alphabay, one of the internet's top sites for the illicit sale of everything from drugs and weapons to forged ids and stolen credit cards. Or at least it was: alphabay went dark on july 5 after authorities seized its servers in canada as part of a multi-nation raid. Police also arrested cazes on july 5 in bangkok, where he is believed to have been living for the last eight years, and impounded luxury cars and mansions, per the bangkok newspaper. He was known as desnake online. Cazes, who was being held at bangkok's narcotics suppression bureau, was found dead in his cell last week, about an hour before he was to meet with prosecutors over his extradition to the us. His alphabay became a force on the dark web a few years ago after the downfall of its main predecessor, silk road. It was \" more than twice as big as silk road was in its heyday, with a revenue of somewhere between $ 600,000 and $ 800,000 a day in early 2017, and that's a rather conservative estimate, \" one expert tells the afp. The us embassy in bangkok confirmed that cazes had been detained \" with a view toward extradition to face federal criminal charges. \" if it was indeed a suicide, cazes might have wanted to avoid the fate of silk road founder \" dread pirate roberts, \" now serving a life sentence.",

Those close to the billionaire say he's discouraged by how the race is going so far and has concerns about trump, sanders, and clinton. And he's asked his advisors to figure out plans for a 2016 presidential campaign. According to the huffington post, bloomberg is the \" sort of independent candidate for whom economic elites have long been clamoring \": liberal on social issues and conservative on economics. Sources say bloomberg would be willing to spend $ 1 billion of his own money on the race, and he's been studying past third-party campaigns and polling his popularity against trump and clinton, the times reports. Bloomberg — a three-term mayor — considered presidential bids in 2008 and 2012, the new york post reports. But he never pulled the trigger because he didn't think he could win, according to the times. That could change this year, pitching himself as a \" technocratic problem-solver and self-made businessman \" against radical candidates. Sources say bloomberg would likely run if it ends up being trump or cruz against sanders. \"hillary is mainstream enough that mike would have no chance, and mike's not going to go on a suicide mission, \" says a friend and former dnc chairman.

Consider: suppose donald trump is the republican nominee and hillary clinton is the democrat. Establishment republicans will be convinced that their party has been hijacked by a bizarre rabble-rouser; gop elites will be unsure which is worse -- the prospect of trump losing, or trump winning.

President donald trump has said japan should have shot down the north korean missiles that flew over the country before landing in the pacific ocean earlier this year, diplomatic sources have said, despite the difficulties and potential ramifications of doing so. The revelation came ahead of trump's arrival in japan on sunday at the start of his five-nation trip to asia. Threats from north korea's nuclear weapons and missile development programs were set to be high on the agenda in his talks with prime minister shinzo abe on monday. Trump questioned japan's decision not to shoot down the missiles when he met or spoke by phone with leaders from southeast asian countries over recent months to discuss how to respond to the threats from north korea, the sources said.

            "Tokyo ( cnn ) president donald trump touched down in japan late saturday ahead of a 13-day trek through asia that he hopes will divert from a bruising political controversy back home. During the first set of remarks on his five-nation tour, trump avoided the incendiary, bellicose rhetoric that has often defined his public stance about the north korean threat. But he nevertheless sent a clear message to north korea and the rest of the region that american military might and strong us alliances in the region remain a critical deterrent during an appearance at a joint us-japanese military base just outside of tokyo. \" our brave warriors are the last bulwark against threats to the dreams of people in america and japan and all across the world, \" trump said. \" you are the greatest hope for people who desire to live in freedom and harmony and you are the greatest threat to tyrants and dictators who seek to prey on the innocent. \" trading in his suit jacket for a flight jacket moments after taking the stage at yokota air base, trump praised the us-japan military alliance, thanked us troops for keeping \" us all safe \" and talked up us military prowess in the region. The remarks served to help set the tone for the president's asian tour that will take him next to south korea, china, vietnam and the philippines for",
            "U.s. President donald trump has said japan should have shot down the north korean missiles that flew over the country before landing in the pacific ocean earlier this year, diplomatic sources have said, despite the difficulties and potential ramifications of doing so. The revelation came ahead of trump's arrival in japan on sunday at the start of his five-nation trip to asia. Threats from north korea's nuclear weapons and missile development programs were set to be high on the agenda in his talks with prime minister shinzo abe on monday. Trump questioned japan's decision not to shoot down the missiles when he met or spoke by phone with leaders from southeast asian countries over recent months to discuss how to respond to the threats from north korea, the sources said. The u.s. President said he could not understand why a country of samurai warriors did not shoot down the missiles, the sources said.

There was a slew of terrorist activity in the months before, including a june 6 ied attack on the consulate itself, the wall street journal reports, but ambassador chris stevens kept security to a minimum to show trust in libya's new government. State department officials say they were mainly worried about rpg and ied attacks. Given that the june attack harmed no one, one official said, \" our security plan worked. \" more details about the attack are still coming to light. The new york times reports today that officials fleeing the consulate took refuge in a nearby villa, where they came under attack again — this time a sophisticated ambush including gun and mortar fire. \" it was really accurate, \" says one libyan militia member who was there that night. \" the people who were shooting at us knew what they were doing. \" initial reports called the villa a \" safe house, \" but like the consulate it was never heavily guarded.",

But the content wasn't about just anybody, it featured a house of representatives member — and her staffers may have been behind it. This week, two former staff members of virgin islands del. Stacey plaskett ( d ) were charged in the circulation of the private material, reports the washington post. Juan mccullum was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of cyberstalking, and dorene browne-louis was indicted on two counts of obstruction of justice. Nbc news reports that mccullum has yet to appear in court, while browne-louis has pleaded not guilty. Though she was named only by her initials in the court documents, plaskett confirmed her identity and said in a statement that her privacy was invaded last year, \" followed by an organized smear campaign, \" just before election time. She says she and her family \" continue to be saddened by the damage we suffered as a result of those egregious acts. \" the indictment alleges that mccullum accessed private content after offering to take a house member's malfunctioning iphone ( plaskett's phone, per nbc ) to a local apple store to be repaired. He left plaskett's staff in june, shortly before the images were posted under a fake name online. Plaskett, who was re-elected with 85 % of the vote, made news this week when she wrote in the hill about the \" eerily similar \" status of the virgin islands to the original 13 colonies, calling it an \" ironic state of freedom without democracy. \"",

The 90,000-year-old bone fragment found in southern siberia marks the first time a direct offspring of these two groups has been discovered, according to a study published wednesday in the journal nature. Both groups disappeared by about 40,000 years ago. Neanderthals lived in europe and asia, while fossils of denisovans are known only from the cave where the fragment was found. Past genetic studies have shown interbreeding between the two groups, as well as with our own species, which left a trace in the dna of today's people. But the new study is the first to identify a first-generation child with neanderthal and denisovan parents. \" it's fascinating to find direct evidence of this mixing going on, \" says svante paabo, one of the study's lead authors. Paabo says he was surprised by the discovery, given how relatively few remains of our evolutionary relatives have been found around the world. The cave near mongolia where the bone was found contains some remains attributed to neanderthals as well as denisovans. But finding an actual offspring of the two groups — which are more different from each other than any two present-day human groups — seemed like a rare stroke of luck. \" the fact that we stumbled across this makes you wonder if the mixing wasn't quite frequent, \" says paabo.

The highlight is room number three, known as \" banksy's room, \" where guests will sleep in a king-size bed underneath banksy's artwork showing a palestinian and an israeli in a pillow fight. The hotel also features a museum with the artist's politically charged work. The guardian describes the guest house as \" hotel, protest and art in one, \" and says bansky's intent is not only to bring jobs and tourism to the area but to foster a dialogue about israeli-palestinian relations. The hotel will host exhibitions by palestinian artists, and it's located in a spot where israelis can legally visit. His team insists it's a legit business venture, not merely an artistic stunt. The cheapest rooms are available from $ 30 a night. Banksy has made previous forays into the palestinians territories. In one secret visit, he drew a painting of a girl pulled upward by balloons on the barrier facing his current project. Last year, he is believed to have sneaked into gaza to draw four street murals.",

So why was it sued anyway? because lawyers wanted to send a message, writes nocera: \" no matter how much money you are willing to pay victims, it will never be enough to keep you out of the courtroom. \" after all, the lawyers have their own business model to protect. Now, he says, the people that stand to benefit are businesses that weren't actually harmed by the spill, and the lawyers themselves, who get more for every business with its hand out. \" all over the gulf, lawyers are advising clients to line up at the bp trough, and they are doing so, \" he writes. \" but how is this righting a wrong? \" meanwhile, bp's ceo has been arguing much the same thing today, telling cnbc that its $ 20 billion compensation fund has been drained dry by attorneys, with just $ 300 million remaining.

Residents of the tiny washington state town of okanogan tell the spokesman-review they saw a jet drawing something in the sky around noon thursday. \"after it made the circles at the bottom, i knew what it was and started laughing, \" ramone duran says. What it was was a giant penis drawn in the sky over central washington. Photos of the sky genitals spread around social media, and it was a popular topic thursday night at a local sports bar in okanogan. Twitter user anahi torres called it \" the most monumental thing to happen in omak. \" while a local mother called krem to complain she would now have to explain to her children what the skywriting depicted, not everyone was upset about the penis hovering above. \"i thought it was pretty funny, and so did he, \" says misty waugh, whose 12-year-old son texted her a photo of it. \"a lot of people have been talking about it. \" officials from naval air station whidbey island say one of their planes was responsible for the skywriting. \" the navy holds its aircrew to the highest standards and we find this absolutely unacceptable, of zero training value and we are holding the crew accountable, \" officials say.

The journal's take is that the llc \" helped conceal a $ 7.5 million payment \" to the manicurist, but a rep for wynn resorts disputes any sexual assault correlation: \" entity y was created to receive settlement proceeds, however there would have been no settlement or negotiations if the matter was about an alleged assault. \" meanwhile, the las vegas review-journal on monday reported that it had spiked a 1998 story detailing misconduct allegations against wynn, including one woman's claim that he pressured her into having sex after she became a grandmother to see what sex with a grandmother was like.
