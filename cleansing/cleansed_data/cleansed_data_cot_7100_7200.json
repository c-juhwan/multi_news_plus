            "Nine years after picking franzen's \" the corrections \" for her book club and then canceling his appearance on her show after he expressed ambivalence over her endorsement, winfrey has chosen his new novel, \" freedom, \" according to three booksellers. The booksellers asked not to be identified, noting that the talk show host is not scheduled to announce her pick until friday. Winfrey's decision tells a story she loves well, redemption, and cites a book that itself redeems a troubled minnesota-based family. Released in late august, \" freedom \" was virtually canonized by critics before publication and has been topping best-seller lists even without oprah's approval. Angela depaul, a spokeswoman for winfrey's production company harpo, would not confirm or deny the selection. \" oprah announces her book club selections on her show and shares her reasons for choosing the books at that time, \" depaul said.",

When oprah selected franzen's novel \"the corrections \" for her book club in 2001, franzen famously balked, going public with misgivings about what the oprah stamp of approval might mean for his book. The book did get a sales boost after being chosen, but franzen's invitation to appear on the popular daytime tv show was withdrawn. \" the corrections \" later won a national book award and has sold nearly 3 million copies. While acknowledging that he and oprah had not had a rapprochement since the incident nine years ago, franzen had this reflection on the old controversy: \"i think that she and i could see more clearly than most any commentator in the land that we were in fact not very far apart.

She's taken six weeks of leave from work, during which deputy prime minister winston peters has taken the reins as acting prime minister. Per ap, ardern's due date was june 17. The birth has been highly anticipated in the south pacific nation of nearly 5 million people. She has not said whether she's expecting a boy or a girl. Ardern's office confirmed she had arrived at the hospital with partner clarke gayford. Ardern has said she is confident the government will continue to run smoothly in her absence.

        "summary": "The engineer of the amtrak train that derailed tuesday night, killing seven, remembers driving the train to the general crash area in philadelphia, but he doesn't remember the crash itself, his attorney tells abc news. Brandon bostian, 32, does remember being banged around in the crash and ultimately regaining consciousness and calling 911, but he has \" no explanation \" for what caused the accident, his lawyer says, adding that the queens resident had \" no health issues to speak of \" before the crash and was not taking any medication. Bostian, who suffered leg injuries, a concussion, and a head injury requiring 14 staples, has given police a blood sample and his cellphone and is cooperating with investigators. Meanwhile, ntsb member robert sumwalt says that it appears from the train's data recorder that the train was indeed going 106mph before bostian pressed the emergency brake, and was going 102mph by the time the recording ended three seconds later. As earlier reported, the speed limit before the curve where the train derailed is 70mph; at the curve, the limit goes down to 50mph. And sumwalt offers this devastating sentence to the new york times: \" we feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred. \" he's talking about technology called \" positive train control, \" which can automatically slow or even halt trains to stop accidents. It's in place on parts of the northeast corridor, but not the portion of the track where the derailment occurred. Congress mandated that it be installed everywhere by the end of this year, but due to challenges getting it in place, the deadline could be extended to 2020. \" clearly it was reckless in terms of the driving by the engineer. There's no way in the world he should have been going that fast into the curve, \" philadelphia mayor michael nutter tells cnn. But sumwalt says the ntsb will \" get the facts before we start making judgments, \" noting that a mechanical problem like faulty brakes could be to blame.",

The huge mass was removed after businesses in the affluent chelsea district complained about a putrid odor, the evening standard reports. \" we see blockages all the time on household sewer pipes, which are about big enough for a cricket ball to pass through, but to have this much damage on a sewer almost a meter in diameter is mind-boggling, \" a repair and maintenance supervisor at the water company tells the guardian. Much of the fat comes from used cooking oil, millions of liters of which are poured down drains in london each year. And the wet wipes ( which some people are apparently using instead of toilet paper ) come from the one in five londoners who admit to flushing them. \" i'd urge people to consider what lurks beneath their feet, \" says the supervisor. \" when it comes to getting rid of fat, ' bin it — don't block it. ' \" the whole messy business, including repairs to the sewer, is expected to cost more than $ 600,000 and take more than two months, with work finishing in may.

The new york times notes that china has long bitten its tongue whenever trump has blasted its policies and actions. But a pair of trump tweets over the weekend, in which he noted he was \" disappointed \" with china in how it's done \" nothing \" about the north korea's nuclear program, appears to have been the last straw. \" trump is quite a personality, and he likes to tweet, \" was the retort monday in a 1,000-word editorial put out by xinhua, china's official state news agency. \" but emotional venting cannot become a guiding policy for solving the nuclear issue on the peninsula. \" the editorial went on to say trump's \" outrage \" is directed toward the \" wrong target, \" and that the us shouldn't \" stab china in the back. \" by trump taking to twitter instead of taking responsibility for north korea itself, he's simply \" adding kindling or, even worse, pouring oil on the flames. \" the times notes this latest conflagration could weaken what was a friendly start to trump's relationship with chinese president xi jinping. China's ambassador to the un said monday that \" no matter how capable china is, china's efforts will not yield practical results because it depends on the two principal parties \" — underscoring china's belief that the us and ally south korea should perhaps pull back on military exercises on and near the korean peninsula to get north korea to play ball. The south china morning post notes trump appeared to accept more responsibility on monday. \" we ' ll handle north korea, \" the president said during a cabinet meeting. \" we're going to be able to handle them.

The move followed a standoff between the trump organization, which had a management contract at the hotel in place until 2031, and majority owner orestes fintiklis, who wanted to fire the organization for alleged mismanagement, the washington post reports. Fintiklis, a cypriot businessman who blamed the trump name for a decline in bookings, told reporters a judge had settled the dispute in his favor. He then played a greek anti-fascist anthem on a piano in the hotel lobby. Fintiklis bought 202 of the hotel's 369 units last year before trying to fire the trump organization. As the dispute escalated last week, police were called to the building twice, abc reports. The trump organization, which is run by president trump's sons, accused fintiklis of \" mob-style tactics \" and insisted that it would still be able to regain control of the hotel. \" trump hotels remains fully confident that it will not only prevail, but recover all of its damages, costs, and attorney's fees, including those...

People were upset winfrey seemed to accept devil worshipers, and letterman's audience got out of hand: kelley claims oprah was not happy that dave failed to defend her against one audience member who yelled, \" rip her, dave. \" after that appearance, kelley writes on the huffington post, dave didn't let up: he made a joke about clams from oprah's restaurant making him sick just days after the devil-worshiping incident, mocked her self-titled magazine in a top 10 list, and made numerous other jokes at her expense over the years. But at the same time, he became a sort of opraholic himself, begging for an invitation to her show. Of course, though she eventually gave in, letterman didn't stop the jokes and, kelley surmises, he probably never will. ( to see what winfrey thinks of kitty kelley, click here. )",

Steve king, who recently courted controversy by trying to keep harriet tubman off the $ 20 bill, found himself at the center of new outrage sunday when he brought twitter \" to a screeching halt \" with what the bbc calls an \" inflammatory \" post complimenting far-right dutch politician geert wilders. \" wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies, \" king tweeted about wilders, known for his anti-islamic and nationalistic rhetoric, along with a retweet from an anti-eu account also praising wilders. King's tweet was widely believed to reference his support for nixing birth citizenship, including changing how the 14th amendment is interpreted so us-born kids of illegal immigrants aren't automatically deemed citizens. King's tweet was met with accusations of white nationalism, helped along by a tweet from david duke that read, \" god bless steve king!!! #truthrising. \" those jumping to condemn king's tweet included chelsea clinton, conservative utah rep. Evan mcmullin, and california rep. Ted lieu, who the new york times notes was born in taiwan and who tweeted a photo of his two sons with the statement: \" dear representative steve king: these are my two babies. \" per the hill, iowa gop chair jeff kaufmann also blasted king, praising the us as \" a nation of immigrants \" and calling diversity \" the strength of any nation. \" kaufmann also told duke to stay away from iowa, calling his take on the subject \" absolute garbage. \" a few hours after his wilders tweet, king moved on, retweeting a national review tweet asking who thinks the muslim brotherhood is a terrorist group.",

People who didn't put their babies to sleep on their backs were most often afraid the baby would choke or wouldn't be as comfortable. Doctors say those beliefs could be due to lack of education or familial pressure.

It adds the show will cause a \" devastation of self-doubt in the minds of young girls \" and may lead to eating disorders. Per refinery29, the show's stars say critics are misinterpreting its message. \" we are not shaming patty, \" co-star alyssa milano tweeted. \" we are addressing ( through comedy ) the damage that occurs from fat shaming. \" ryan also posted a statement on social media, saying she's struggled with her own body image and that the show employs \" satire \" to deal with such issues. \" satire is a way to poke fun at the hardest things … and enter difficult conversations, \" she wrote. \" we're not in the business of fat shaming.

The taliban took responsibility for the strike at the spozhmai hotel, saying foreigners and rich afghans were having \" wild parties \" there before tomorrow's religious holiday. The hotel is one of several in the qargha lake recreation area, where the wealthy are known to congregate with government officials.

General john allen's comments come days after u.s. Defense secretary leon panetta said washington was at the limits of its patience with pakistan over the existence of militant networks including the haqqanis. Pakistan says it is doing everything it can to fight militants on its side of the border and accuses afghanistan of trying to shift the blame for its failure to combat the insurgency. At the hotel, terrified guests jumped into the lake in the darkness to escape the carnage, afghan officials and residents said. Up to 300 people had been inside the hotel when the attack began.

        "summary": "Tibetans are largely unique among humans for their ability to live comfortably at high altitudes. The tibetan plateau, nicknamed the \" roof of the world, \" stands an average of 15,000 feet above sea level. That's just shy of 3 miles — making it the highest plateau on the planet and an area whose air contains roughly 40 % less oxygen. But tibetans don't seem to have adapted over the millennia, nor is a genetic mutation responsible for their ability: researchers have discovered they share a gene with our hominid cousin the denisovans, who went extinct some 40,000 years ago; their study was published in nature yesterday. Known as epas1, the gene allows tibetans to absorb scarce oxygen without creating extra red blood cells — something the rest of us mortals must deal with at altitude, and which can lead to dangerously high blood pressure, cardiac arrest, and lower birth-weight babies, reports npr. Since many europeans and asians are 1 % to 3 % neanderthal, we know our species intermingled with other closely related but distinct species, but we've only known about denisovans since 2010, when scientists sequenced the dna from two teeth and a pinkie found in a cave in siberia, reports slate. The study's lead author tells time the findings prompt an even larger question: \" we found the denisovan species at the dna level, but how many other species are out there that we haven't sequenced? \" ( click to read about where scientists think denisovans lived. )",

            "With help from extinct humans, tibetans adapted to high altitude toggle caption frederic j. Brown/afp/getty images at an altitude of nearly 3 miles, the tibetan plateau is an extreme place to live. It's cold, it's hard to grow food, and there's about 40 percent less oxygen in the air than there is at sea level. Somehow, though, native tibetans are adapted to it. Their bodies — and their blood in particular — work differently than those of people used to lower altitudes. The tibetans ' advantage might be thanks to an ancient inheritance. When someone used to living at low altitude travels to the oxygen-deprived tibetan plateau, his or her body responds by producing more red blood cells to help circulate oxygen through the body. Sounds like a good thing, right? not quite. \" you don't want your blood to become too thick, \" says rasmus nielsen, a geneticist at university of california, berkeley. Too many red blood cells can lead to thick blood that is harder for the heart to pump. People who aren't adapted to high altitudes have an increased risk of stroke. When pregnant women move up to high altitudes, they tend to have difficulties with high blood pressure, suffer a higher rate of infant mortality and are more likely to give birth",
            "When you or i go up to high altitude, we gasp for a while, maybe faint, and then gradually adapt. The way we do it is by furiously generating more red blood cells, to increase the blood's ability to absorb oxygen, which gets thinner the higher we go. But we pay a price: all of those extra blood cells can make the blood sticky, leading to a risk of high blood pressure, heart attack and, in pregnant women, the delivery of low-birth-weight babies. We pay that price, that is, unless we're natives of the tibetan plateau, where people live more or less cheerfully at altitudes of 13,000 feet and more. The secret lies in their genes — mostly in a gene known as epas1, which allows them to absorb scarce oxygen without creating extra blood cells. But while genetic traits are often created by mutations within a given species, this one evidently came from outside. According to a paper just published in the current nature, the tibetans ' ancestors evidently mated with a now extinct human species known as the denisovans, which went extinct somewhere around 40,000 years ago. It's no surprise that matings have happened between modern humans and other human species. We share a fair number of genes with the more familiar neanderthals, for example,"

        "summary": "The first senate bill to legalize recreational marijuana across the us was introduced wednesday, courtesy of democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders, the hill reports. The senator's ending federal marijuana prohibition act would let states legalize recreational pot without government interference while still allowing individual states to ban it. According to the huffington post, a gallup poll last month showed 58 % of americans supported legalizing marijuana. But sanders ' bill is unlikely to get serious consideration as long as republicans continue to control the senate, the wall street journal reports. Regardless the move is only going to help sanders with young voters, among whom he's already popular, according to the hill. The ending federal marijuana prohibition act would remove pot from the controlled substances act and the dea's list of \" most dangerous \" drugs, the huffington post reports. According to the journal, federal laws place marijuana in the same category as heroin or lsd: likely to be abused and having no medical use. Sanders endorsed legalization last week during a campaign stop at george mason university. \" too many americans have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use, \" the hill quotes him. \" that's wrong. That has got to change. \" sanders ' bill is similar to a bill introduced in the house of representatives two years ago and reintroduced this year, the huffington post reports.",

An nfl insider told wthr of the investigation, which was confirmed to bob glauber of newsday, as per a tweet. Deflating a ball can make it easier or harder to control, wthr notes. It could also help with grip on a rainy day like yesterday, yahoo sports notes. #deflategate is now trending on twitter. \" i ' m told at one point the officials took a ball out of play and weighed it, \" wthr's bob kravitz tweeted. A delay before kickoff in the third quarter could have been the result of an investigation, yahoo reports. If the team is found to have deflated balls, it could lose draft picks, kravitz says. He added that \" nobody is suggesting this is why the colts lost obviously. They were manhandled. \" the patriots beat the colts 45-7.",

        "summary": "The tragedy is extreme — now 10 people dead after being contained in a stiflingly hot tractor-trailer parked at a san antonio walmart — and so too is the potential sentence for james m. Bradley jr. In advance of his monday appearance in federal court, the 60-year-old driver of the truck was charged with transporting immigrants in the us illegally — a charge that could carry the death penalty, reports the ap. The san antonio express-news explains that the law allows the penalties to be elevated when a human smuggling operation ends in death. The latest: the victims: the express-news reports all the casualties are adult males. The ordeal: the federal complaint says the immigrants'destination via the truck was san antonio, and that breathing issues set in about an hour in. The passengers reportedly took turns breathing through a hole in the pitch-black trailer and pounded on its walls in a futile attempt to get bradley's attention. The ap notes that san antonio sits about 150 miles from the border. Bradley's story: he says he had no idea there were people in the truck, per court docs that quote a homeland security investigations agent. Bradley says he got out at walmart to use the bathroom, heard the banging, opened the door, \" and was surprised when he was run over by'spanish ' people and knocked to the ground. \" he told authorities the trailer had been sold and his boss asked him to drive it from iowa to brownsville, texas. What bradley said in court: nothing, per the ap. He faces another hearing thursday. More to prosecute: acting ice director thomas homan earlier said the truck likely picked up the illegal immigrants once they were in the us, reports the ap. \" even though they have the driver in custody, i can guarantee you there's going to be many more people we're looking for to prosecute, \" he said. Similar case: the tragedy calls to mind another from 2003, in which 19 people died inside a truck in texas. The washington post looks back at all the steps leading to that disaster. Temperatures inside the trailer hit 173 degrees. Words of comfort, outrage: the express-news rounds up statements from a slew of prominent texans. Two cents: the express-news editorial board weighs in: \" imagine if there were a functional — legal — mechanism for such immigrants to come here.... The current system is broken.... The laws, as currently enforced, set a premium on punishing the immigrants but leaving employers virtually alone.... Comprehensive reform could fix all this. Yet, congress is more interested in punishment than fixes",

        "summary": "It's incredibly rare and incredibly intriguing. A few people in the world have something called \" blindsight, \" which describes their ability to subconsciously perceive their environments in spite of being blind. A researcher in 2007 described the science of the phenomenon — the term was coined in 1974 — in scientific american: our neural pathways enable us to determine what and where things are around us, essentially allowing us to see and interact with them. If all those pathways aren't destroyed, and information still flows \" through secondary neural pathways that bypass \" the primary visual cortex, blindsight can result. \" for some unknown reason, these secondary routes are not sufficient to maintain the feeling of sight, \" she writes, and yet our ability to interact is preserved. A doctor provides a real-world hypothetical in the guardian: someone with blindsight has a letter to mail; though he cannot see or describe the mail slot, he can slide the letter right in it. The bbc zeros in on milina cunning, a scottish woman who lost her sight in her 20s and whose blindsight has been \" extensively \" studied. Less hypothetically, cunning describes a test she participated in, in which she was told to walk through a hallway full of chairs; she repeatedly collided with them. She was then instructed to do it again at a faster-than-normal pace — and says she didn't hit one. She says the neurologist explained to her that by not thinking about it, her subconscious was able to take over. ( this woman says a disorder caused her to make herself blind. )",

He viewed not just intelligence agencies but most of government as stocked with a devious bureaucratic underbelly, the \"deep state. \" mr. Trump, who has never worked in government, eagerly adopted that view. Mr. Bannon was notorious for maintaining his own, shadowy presence within the white house. He would frequently skip meetings where policy was discussed, injecting his views into the process in other ways, according to two administration officials. He did not use a computer, preferring to have paper printed and handed to his assistant to stay outside the formal decision-making process. Mr. Bannon favored a culture similar to the one mr. Trump brought with him from the business world to the white house — a flat structure with blurred lines of responsibility and competing power centers. And early on mr. Bannon"

Confusion seemed to follow, with one gop lawmaker shutting off the microphones and declaring the house to be in recess, while a ryan spokesman said, \" the house cannot operate without members following the rules of the institution, so the house has recessed subject to the call of the chair. \" hillary clinton gave a thumbs-up to the gun control goings-on, retweeting an igor volsky tweet imploring people to \" stop watching trump \" rip into clinton during a wednesday morning speech.

Curtis reeves responded to a text from his son, who was supposed to meet his parents in the theater but was running late, with a text saying that he and his wife were already in their seats, according to newly released court documents. It's unclear whether any previews were playing at the time, but they definitely were 15 minutes later when reeves got into an altercation with chad oulson, who was texting his daughter's babysitter. Reeves claims self-defense, saying the 43-year-old oulson confronted him when reeves told him to stop texting. He is charged with second-degree murder and aggravated battery, the latter because the bullet that killed oulson also struck oulson's wife in the finger. The ap notes two other tidbits from the new documents: reeves, a retired tampa cop, had received letters of commendation during his career for leading training seminars on, among other things, gun safety. A 35-year-old woman told investigators that reeves got upset with her in december — a month before the fatal shooting — because she was texting in the same theater.

The revelation comes from court documents released wednesday in the case that has drawn national attention. Matthew reeves, the defendant's son, said in an interview with deputies after the jan. 13 shooting that he was running late to meet his parents for a 1: 20 p.m. Show of lone survivor. He texted his father that he was on the way. His father wrote back that he and his wife, vivian, were in their seats. About 15 minutes later, matthew reeves walked into the theater as a single shot rang out. Matthew reeves, a tampa police officer, told investigators he caught chad oulson, who was struck in the chest, as he collapsed in the aisle. Authorities say curtis reeves, 71, who also made his career as a tampa officer, shot oulson, 43, during a confrontation over oulson texting his daughter's babysitter during the previews. Matthew reeves told pasco sheriff's deputies that he didn't see the argument or the shot but that \" noise and light \" was coming from the top row as he walked into the darkness of auditorium 10.

But while the trailer is suitably cryptic, if you've been paying close attention to the rumors surrounding this penultimate season, it paints an intriguing picture of the battles coming to westeros. And although we're dealing with a lot of speculation here, it's rooted in set reports we've been hearing from game of thrones season seven for the last year and a half, so just in case... Cersei ( lena headey ) starts the trailer off by enumerating how badly she's fucked up, in the wake of her shocking ascension to the iron throne.

        "summary": "Let's face it, the medical standard for diagnosing the second most common cancer in men is rather, well, unrefined: a doctor inserts his or her index finger into the anus and feels around for any hard masses on the prostate gland. It should be no surprise, then, that men aren't lining up to volunteer their rectums at med schools. So scientists at imperial college london have developed a robotic rectum ( the prototype costs around $ 13,300 ) they claim is far superior to the plastic models currently used for practice sessions, and they presented it last week at the eurohaptics conference, reports quartz. A pilot study involving 20 medical professionals went well, and plans are in the works to adapt the technology into a device for gynecological exams, too. The prosthetic turns out to be much more than the sum of its parts. As a finger probes, robotic arms push back to recreate the, ahem, behavior of an actual rectum, and the bot tracks the finger's position as well as force to provides constant feedback. The whole thing is viewable via a 3d display so student and teacher can appreciate the ins and outs of the procedure together in a way that wasn't possible before. \"because the examinations occur in the body, the trainer cannot see what the trainee is doing, and vice versa, \" says a doctor at imperial college, per the telegraph.

            "A robotic rectum may help doctors and nurses detect prostate cancer. The technology, which consists of prosthetic buttocks and rectum with in-built robotic technology, has been developed by scientists at imperial college london. The idea is the device helps train doctors and nurses to perform rectal examinations by accurately recreating the feel of a rectum, as well as providing feedback on their examination technique. The device contains small robotic arms that apply pressure to the silicone rectum, to recreate the shape and feel of the back passage. The technology, which is being presented at the eurohaptics conference this week at imperial, is now being adapted for gynaecological exams. Rectal examinations are necessary to diagnose conditions such as prostate cancer and involve a medic placing their index finger into the anus, and feeling the prostate gland. The walnut-size gland sits below a man's bladder, and can be felt just inside the anus, through the rectal wall. Around one in eight men in the uk suffer from prostate cancer at some point in their lives. Furthermore, 75 per cent of men over 70 suffer from benign prostate enlargement, which although harmless can cause urinary problems. A rectal examination is often the first test a doctor or nurse uses to recognise a problem prostate. This determines whether they send a patient for further tests. Generally, cancerous prostates tend to feel hard and knobbly, but learning exactly what a potentially cancerous prostate feels like can be difficult, explains dr fernando bello, from the department of surgery and cancer at imperial college london: \" internal examinations are really challenging to learn - and to teach.

        "summary": "Beauty sleep is no myth. A new study out of stockholm university published in the royal society open science journal finds a lack of sleep makes a person look \" significantly \" less attractive, per the bbc. And that's not all. Swollen eyelids and dark circles around the eyes might also prevent people from hanging out with you, say researchers, who photographed 25 volunteers without makeup after two consecutive nights of about 7.5 hours of sleep and again after two consecutive nights of slightly less than 4.5 hours of sleep, reports the los angeles times. The scientists then showed the photos to 122 strangers in sweden, who were asked to rate the subject's attractiveness, health, sleepiness, and trustworthiness, then decide if they'd be likely to socialize with that person, per the telegraph. A person's trustworthiness was rated about the same no matter which photo participants were viewing. But participants were generally less likely to socialize with subjects suffering from a lack of sleep, whom they considered less attractive, less healthy, and more sleepy than subjects who'd gotten a good night's sleep, according to the study. Researchers have a clear theory on this: they suggest humans inherently avoid those who look tired or ill as a means of steering clear of disease. A tired person might also be viewed as a risk — perhaps they ' ll slip up in their drowsiness — whereas people who look more energetic are probably viewed as being better company, researchers say. ( a nap might make you happier. )",

            "Some of our past posts talked about careless driving, distracted driving, drivers striking our squads while at accident scenes. I also spoke of the dangers officers face while on foot at traffic crashes directing traffic, rendering aid and investigating the accidents. Every officer could tell you stories how drivers yell and swear at them for the driver being inconvenienced by the traffic diversion as the result of a crash. They could also tell you how drivers, while looking at the crash scene, don't follow directions, run over their cones or try to maneuver around their squad to get through. I have attached a 30 second video of a highway in germantown to give you a small idea of what it is like for an officer, through their eyes, to be out on foot near traffic. Turn on your sound while watching. The officers feel the wind created by the semis ruffle their uniform as they pass. Debris, salt and gravel whip up and sometimes go into their eyes. Some drivers do not follow the move over law. The speed in which the traffic flows gives the officers very little time to react. Please think of this post the next time you are upset because traffic is moving slow as the result of a crash, or when an officer has to detour your route which may cause you to be late for an event. Most importantly, pay close attention as you pass through an accident scene. Chief peter hoell 64 15",

Information from the site comes from invisible children's radio network, local ngos and un agencies. Reports can then be filtered by type of attack such as looting, lra sighting, abduction and civilian injury, among others. Users can also report attacks by emailing invisible children.

Speaking from cape canaveral, bezos went over the revamped blueprint for blue origin, the firm he founded 15 years ago, npr reports. \" the [ complex 36 ] site saw its last launch in 2005 and the pad has stood silent for more than 10 years — too long, \" he writes in a blog post. \" we can't wait to fix that. \" florida gov. Rick scott was also at today's event, and noted that the blue origin initiative will bring more than 300 jobs and $ 220 million to the region's economy, per npr. The be-4 engines bezos wants to use in the rockets will also be tested at the new facility, with the first qualification for flight expected in 2017 and the first vulcan launch anticipated for 2019, per blue origin. Bezos, who ended the blog post with his company's \" gradatim ferociter! \" motto — wired explains it means \" step-by-step, ferociously \" in latin — noted at the end of the presser that \" one day … i look forward to having a press conference with you guys in space, \" per his washington post.

            "Mitt romney continues his rise, according to a gallup poll released today that suggests he has a seven-point national lead over president obama. The tracking poll, which surveyed likely voters, put romney ahead 52-45, gallup reported. The poll, experts cautioned, is one of several that should be gauged to get an accurate assessment of the status of the campaign. An abc news/washington post survey of likely voters from oct. 15 had obama leading romney 49-46. Nicolle wallace, a top aide to sen. John mccain during his 2008 run and current abc news analyst, said \" the numbers [ in the gallup poll ] suggest that the first debate permanently liberated romney from the caricature that had been created by the obama campaign's ad onslaught and by romney's own high profile gaffes. \" if his numbers hold up after his second -- weaker -- debate performance, the romney campaign will go into the final two weeks with understandable confidence, \" she said. Neither the romney nor the obama campaigns addressed the latest figures. The gallup poll released today presents a rolling average of results gathered during the past week. So any boost obama might have gained from his more energetic showing in new york tuesday night is still mostly missing.

The monkeys at the hendry county farm are imported from other countries and sent to clients such as the national institutes of health for experiments, according to the peta report. The exposé led to a usda investigation of primate products. \" here we have the greatest concentration of monkey farms in the world, \" peta official justin goodman says, according to the guardian. \" they have no place in hendry county and no place in the 21st century, and we want to see them all shut down. \" the peta undercover worker was employed at the facility for eight months, and the organization insists that the video is indicative of the treatment of primate products'thousands of monkeys. Primate products president jeff rowell admits that the video was \" shocking, \" and pledged to address the husbandry violations. \" i can't just sit on my hands, \" he tells the news-press. \" i ' m accountable to clients, i ' m accountable to the county, and i ' m accountable to the public … the biggest consequence is losing public trust.

        "summary": "Jonah hill's writing and directing debut has arrived. Mid90s, partly based on hill's own childhood, focuses on a 13-year-old looking for acceptance among a crew of older skateboarders in 1990s los angeles. The r-rated, coming-of-age flick has a 79 % rating from critics on rotten tomatoes, and an even better 95 % audience score. What to expect: \" not a lot happens in mid90s but as a slice of teenage life, it feels almost like a documentary from that time, full of well-observed — if foul-mouthed and sometimes dangerous — moments that ring true, \" cary darling writes at the houston chronicle. He also enjoyed the \" killer soundtrack. \" part of the reason it's so \" terrific \" is that the film feels authentic, thanks to hill's autobiographical influences and \" a grainy, home-movie aesthetic, \" rafer guzman writes at newsday. Yet the power lies with star sunny suljic. He \" packs a megaton of intensity into his miniature frame, \" guzman writes. \" it just might be the performance of the year. \" adam graham agrees \" the tribal rituals of skateboarding are celebrated with authenticity and exuberance \" in this \" strong start \" from a first-time director. \" if the story's emotional stakes are lacking, hill makes up for it in mood and feel, \" making viewers \" invested in the minor triumphs of putting oneself out there, \" he adds at the detroit news. Ann hornaday liked the \" unfussily authentic \" movie, too. \" an appealing cast of newcomers and little-knowns … give the film a welcome dash of warmth and spontaneity, \" she writes at the washington post. One problem: it feels unfinished. \" it's more of a fragment, ending on a cheerfully liberated but not particularly resolved note, \" she writes. ( as a kid, hill almost had an arm amputated. )",

        "summary": "Interesting times indeed: the republican national convention kicks off in cleveland on monday and the chief of the city's largest police union feels that the situation is so volatile that gun rights should be temporarily rolled back. Steve loomis, president of the cleveland police patrolmen's association, tells cnn that after the shooting of three officers in baton rouge on sunday, he thinks openly carrying firearms during the convention would be \" irresponsible \" and he wants open carry to be banned in the whole county until the rnc is over. Loomis says he wants gov. John kasich to issue an order, and \" i don't care if it's constitutional or not at this point. \" kasich, however, says ohio governors \" do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws. \" two men with long guns briefly turned up at a protest sunday, apparently to demonstrate their open carry rights, cleveland.com reports. Other demonstrators including 100 nude women in an art installation, assorted anti-donald trump groups that held marches and rallies, and a gathering of thousands of people on the hope memorial bridge with a message of love. Some 11,000 attended a gop event at the rock and roll hall of fame, with entertainment including three dog night. The gop released its convention program sunday and it looks like it will be one big trumpfest at the quicken loans arena: with daily themes like \" make america safe again \" and \" make america first again, \" there will be a trump speaking each day, starting with melania on monday and finishing with both ivanka and donald on thursday. Other speakers include rick perry, scott baio, duck dynasty's willie robertson, and ted cruz. There will be around 50,000 people attending, the ap reports in its convention preview, but prominent republicans including the party's last two presidents and last two nominees will not be among them. Kasich is also skipping the convention. Marco rubio will also be appearing, but only via video, roll call notes. In a look at what to expect on day 1, the new york times predicts that the baton rouge police shooting will lead to even stronger republican calls for law and order. In the evening, melania trump's speech may mark the start of a trump effort to improve his dismal ratings among women voters. This promises to be a memorable convention, but it will have a long way to go to rank among the wildest in us history, politico finds in a look at convention craziness in years past, including 1924, when democrats exchanged taunts of \" ku klux mcadoo \"",

A horrific new case has the potential to unleash similar unrest. The victim was an 8-year-old girl in kashmir who belonged to a nomadic muslim tribe, and the details are rough. Police say she was lured away from the horses she was grazing, sedated, and raped multiple times by men in a hindu temple over the course of at least three days, reports the new york times. At that point, police say the men killed the girl by hitting her head with a stone, and her body was found in a nearby forest a week after she disappeared, reports the indian express. Authorities say muslim-hindu tensions are behind the murder of the girl, known as asifa. The custodian of the local hindu temple wanted to frighten away her bakarwals tribe from the area and saw the girl as a \" soft target, \" say police, per the guardian. The custodian, sanji ram, is among eight hindu men charged in the state of jammu and kashmir. Two of the eight are police officers accused of taking bribes in their investigation. The murder happened in january, but new court proceedings have inflamed tensions. Thousands of members of a hindu group linked to the ruling bjp party have marched to demand the release of the suspects, and a large group of hindu lawyers tried to block the filing of charges monday at the local court, per the ap. They claim the men are innocent but will not get a fair trial because the investigating officers are muslim. Protests and counter-protests are now spreading.",

        "summary": "Biologists have long debated how the planet's first mass extinction took place 540 million years ago. Was it a huge meteorite or terrifying volcanic eruption, typical of earth's other mass extinctions? nope, per a recent paper that says it offers the first \" critical test \" of the theory that the first animals simply gobbled up or trampled on the species that preceded them, ifl science reports. The arrival of earth's first animals — creatures like jellyfish, vertebrates, and sponges — occurred during the so-called \" cambrian explosion \" and spawned most of the world's animal phyla. Their apparent victims: the ediacarans, multi-celled marine organisms with odd shapes like fronds, tubes, and discs, according to a press release. For 60 million years, many of them survived by just passively ingesting the water's chemicals via their membranes. It seems the new animals easily dominated their motionless neighbors. \" modern animals are ecosystem engineers, \" study co-author simon darroch of vanderbilt university told new scientist in april. \" they alter the environment, burrow into sediments, and prey on each other. \" how does he know that's what happened? well, fossil and sediment evidence from a site in namibia, southern africa, suggest that ediacarans were \" ecologically stressed \" at the time and saw their diversity declining, he says. And rocks from the period show increasing tracks and burrows by earth's first animals, \" presenting a plausible link between their evolution and extinction of the ediacarans, \" per the release. Also interesting: \" there is a powerful analogy between the earth's first mass extinction and what is happening today, \" darroch says, because \" new behaviors can fundamentally change the entire planet, and we are the most powerful ' ecosystem engineers ' ever known. \" ( one of those early predators was a sea scorpion that grew \" as big as tom cruise. \" )",

Sixty million years later, these were followed by the first animals, an evolutionary experiment with a bewildering range of body types known as the cambrian explosion. Around the time of the cambrian explosion, many of the ediacaran species disappeared. The extinction is not considered as disastrous as the \"great",

But the world's first known mass extinction, which took place about 540 million years ago, now appears to have had a more subtle cause: evolution itself. \"people have been slow to recognize that biological organisms can also drive mass extinction, \" said simon darroch, assistant professor of earth and environmental sciences at vanderbilt university. \"but our comparative study of several communities of ediacarans, the world's first multicellular organisms, strongly supports the hypothesis that it was the appearance of complex animals capable of altering their environments, which we define as 'ecosystem engineers,'that resulted in the ediacaran"

The lion was wearing a gps tracker, and authorities say he was tricked into leaving the park, shot with a bow and arrow, tracked for 40 hours, and killed with a rifle outside the park on private land. Some hunters claim this means the kill was legal, while his brutal beheading has caused outrage in zimbabwe and beyond. Authorities are now on the hunt for a spaniard who allegedly paid a park guide $ 55,000 to kill the beloved lion, reports the guardian; two people who accompanied him have been detained. The zimbabwe professional hunters and guides association has confirmed on facebook that the professional hunter on the hunting permit was one of its members, and the group has deemed the act unethical and suspended the hunter's membership \" indefinitely. \" meanwhile, conservationists worry that as many as a dozen cubs are now vulnerable to infanticide as other males close in on the two prides led by cecil and jericho, a male with whom he was in coalition. There are six lionesses in the prides, and \" jericho as a single male will be unable to defend the two prides and cubs from new males that invade the territory, \" a principal researcher from oxford who studies these lions tells national geographic. A conservationist in spain says \" we're ashamed \" that \" in spain there are rich madmen who pay for the pleasure of killing wild animals such as lions. \" ( a game of thrones editor, recently killed by a lioness in south africa, was raising money to combat poaching. )",

But the washington post reports that current ag jeff sessions has an unusual situation three months into the new administration: he has yet to fill a single one of those 93 positions. \" we really need to work hard on that, \" said sessions on tuesday. About half of the obama administration attorneys resigned when president trump took office, and sessions ordered the holdovers to quit last month. None have been replaced, though sessions suggested the acting federal prosecutors in place will do fine until that happens. \" there are human beings occupying each of those seats, \" says a skeptical ronald weich, a former assistant attorney general who is now dean of the university of baltimore's law school. \" but that's not the same as having appointed and confirmed officials who represent the priorities of the administration. \" complicating matters is the fact that sessions doesn't have his no. 2 in place — the deputy ag is traditionally charged with shepherding the selection of federal prosecutors — though nominee rod rosenstein is expected to be confirmed by the senate this month. Sessions, meanwhile, plans big changes in how those prosecutors will handle cases, including tougher enforcement of immigration laws. That includes stronger penalties for transporting and harboring undocumented immigrants, fox news notes.",

Now, per wink news, lee coel, the cop who pulled the trigger has been arrested and charged with felony manslaughter — and tom lewis, the chief of the punta gorda pd, has been charged with a misdemeanor of culpable negligence, the state attorney's office announced wednesday. Coel, who ended up fatally shooting 73-year-old mary knowlton with real bullets instead of the fake ones meant to be used during the community exercise, showed \" a pattern of complacency, questionable decisions, and insubordination \" even before knowlton's shooting, wink uncovered in december. He's been on administrative leave since the incident and posted a $ 5,000 bond to get out of charlotte county jail wednesday afternoon. Knowlton — whose family accepted a $ 2 million-plus settlement in november with the police and city — was one of a few dozen citizens taking part in the role-playing activity, meant to show participants how quickly cops have to act in dangerous situations. There are conflicting reports from fox 13 and wfts whether coel, then 28, or knowlton was playing the cop. Coel's lawyer said last week coel thought his gun contained blanks, adding cryptically they now know who loaded the gun ( without offering additional details ). Lewis will answer his summons in court on april 5 for his role — allegedly failing to keep the event safe, per nbc 2. \" why did [ coel ] aim the gun at her and not off to the side? \" a local asks, per the naples daily news. The family of knowlton, meanwhile, says the librarian who'd been married for 54 years would have preached forgiveness. \" that's what my mom was about, \" her son said.",

A project called rolling jubillee is soliciting donations to buy up bad debts at bargain prices and cancel them, the telegraph reports. So far they've only bought $ 14,000 in debt for $ 500, but they want to refill their coffers and expand nationwide. The debts they cancel include housing, outstanding medical bills, and student loans — but they can't eliminate a specific person's debt, according to their website. Still, it's \" a simple, powerful way to help folks in need — to free them from heavy debt loads so they can focus on being productive, happy and healthy, \" writes organizer david rees on his blog. And only $ 50,000 can free up $ 1 million in debt, according to a rolling jubilee video posted on youtube. \" we bailed out the banks and in return they turned their backs on us, \" says an activist in the video. \" it's time for a bailout of the people, by the people. \" ( see what occupiers are doing for superstorm sandy victims. )",

Ows is going to start buying distressed debt ( medical bills, student loans, etc. ) in order to forgive it. As a test run, we spent $ 500, which bought $ 14,000 of distressed debt. We then erased that debt. ( if you're a debt broker, once you own someone's debt you can do whatever you want with it – traditionally, you hound debtors to their grave trying to collect.

            "The people's bailout this is a long post but it's about something pretty interesting so i hope you ' ll indulge … like many folks, occupy wall street has been some doing good work in the aftermath of hurricane sandy, helping people on the ground. Now ows is launching the rolling jubilee, a program that has been in development for months. Ows is going to start buying distressed debt ( medical bills, student loans, etc. ) in order to forgive it. As a test run, we spent $ 500, which bought $ 14,000 of distressed debt. We then erased that debt. ( if you're a debt broker, once you own someone's debt you can do whatever you want with it – traditionally, you hound debtors to their grave trying to collect. We're playing a different game. A more awesome game. ) this is a simple, powerful way to help folks in need – to free them from heavy debt loads so they can focus on being productive, happy and healthy. As you can see from our test run, the return on investment approaches 30: 1. That's a crazy bargain! now, after many consultations with attorneys, the irs, and our moles in the debt-brokerage world, we are ready to take the rolling jubilee program live and nationwide, buying debt in communities that have been struggling during the recession. We're kicking things off with a show called the people's bailout at le poisson rouge on thursday, november 15. It will also stream online, like a good ol ' -fashioned telethon! friends, the line-up is insane.

Investor emad tawfilis met with robert dahl at napa's dahl vineyards on monday to discuss a financial dispute, with their lawyers on speakerphone. But when the call ended during a break, police say dahl pulled a gun on tawfilis, who ran from the office and through the vineyard. He was able to call 911 as dahl followed him in an suv, firing at him with a.22-caliber semiautomatic handgun. An injured tawfilis then \" fell to the ground as dahl exited his suv with the handgun, walked up to the victim and appeared to execute him just as the deputies were arriving, \" police say, per the san francisco chronicle. After a high-speed chase, dahl crashed into a wooded area and apparently shot himself as authorities closed in. Tawfilis ' lawyer says his client's investment group had loaned dahl $ 1.2 million to start minnesota's patio wine company, which dahl then closed. Tawfilis filed a lawsuit last august claiming dahl misused the money to encourage investments in other properties. Dahl also sued tawfilis, arguing his interest charges were \" illegally high, \" the ap reports. Tawfilis ' lawyer says the men agreed dahl would pay tawfilis an undisclosed amount of money and they were to hash out the details during the meeting. Dahl's lawyer says it was a \" peaceful \" discussion. \" there was certainly no indication of violence. \" a former business partner says dahl, previously convicted of felony swindling and theft, was \" one of the best salesmen i ever met. But i later found out many of his business dealings were not ethical or legal. \" ( dahl vineyards was damaged in last year's wine country quake. )",

The last-second agreement to keep the government open appears to have upset at least one important person. \" our country needs a good'shutdown ' in september to fix mess! \" the new york times quotes president trump as tweeting tuesday. According to the atlantic, trump appears to be the first president ever to actually advocate for a shutdown; shutdowns are generally unpopular with the public because they lead to things like delayed benefit checks and closed national parks. It appears trump is upset because the funding bill negotiated by congress doesn't include money for his border wall, gave more funding to the national institutes of health than border security, and didn't slash the budgets of the epa and state department. In another tweet, trump sees two possible solutions: elect more republican senators in 2018 — in order to beat the 60 % filibuster threshold — or \" change the rules now to 51 %. \" trump could actually cause a shutdown this week if he really wanted to by refusing to sign the funding bill, but he's said he ' ll sign it. The white house immediately contradicted trump's tweets, saying the budget deal is a win for trump and that democrats are the ones who want the government to shut down.",

        "summary": "Corey lewandowski thinks the democrats have a real chance at taking over the house of representatives and, if they do, he thinks president trump has \" a real problem. \" in a sunday radio interview, the hill reports that trump's one-time campaign manager admitted the party has \" good opportunities \" to win the seats needed to seize the majority after the 2018 midterm elections. If democrats pull off the feat, lewandowski believes introducing articles of impeachment against trump will be near the top of their list of to-dos, just after stopping the president's agenda. Lewandowski notes that over 30 republican members of congress have said they won't seek re-election, while the democrats need to win just 24 seats to take over. An undercurrent to lewandowski's fears can be seen in recent polling that show americans strongly favoring democrats going into 2018. Dems are preferred by 17 points in generic polling conducted by quinnipiac university. What's more, the washington post reports that trump's own popularity is at an historic low, which many believe could drag down his party as the election nears. However, even if a democratic takeover happens, it remains unclear whether the impeachment proceedings lewandowski fears would be the will of the people. Even with trump's low approvals, the same quinnipiac poll that so heavily favored the democrats also found that 51 % of americans think the party should not begin impeachment proceedings should they win back the majority.",

        "summary": "You'd think a doctor with, say, a terminal illness or a weak heart would have an inside edge over the rest of us and opt for the most whiz-bang, no-holds-barred treatment available. Just the opposite, writes ken murray, md, in the zocalo public square ( as spotted by andrew sullivan's blog ). Doctors \" don't die like the rest of us, \" writes murray. \" what's unusual about them is not how much treatment they get compared to most americans, but how little. \" they have seen first-hand the desperate, expensive, usually futile measures taken to save a life, generally because end-of-life wishes were not explicitly spelled out. It's all about surgery, tubes, and drugs, and it usually results not in a miracle cure but in astronomical bills and \" misery we would not inflict on a terrorist. \" to illustrate the alternative, murray shares the story of his cousin, who, upon learning he had terminal lung cancer, opted to forgo intensive chemo and instead moved in with murray. He lived another eight months, during which the two focused on his quality of life, ate good food, and watched sports. Total medical cost: about $ 20, for the price of one drug. No wonder, then, that doctors instead often choose to \" go gently \" at home, writes murray. The full column, here, is worth a read.",

        "summary": "The execution of georgia inmate warren hill has been delayed at the last minute for a third time — not because experts have deemed him mentally retarded, but because of a new law that makes the identities of those supplying lethal-injection drugs a \" confidential state secret. \" a judge granted a temporary stay of execution 4 hours before hill was due to die to give her more time to consider the law, reports the atlanta journal-constitution. Other states including arkansas and tennessee have introduced similar laws in an effort to dodge drug makers ' attempts to stop their products from being used to kill people. The law also allows the state to conceal the identities of doctors who administer lethal injections, a process hill's lawyer says is a \" shameful, reprehensible, cowardly way of killing people, \" the guardian reports. Hill was serving a life sentence for shooting his girlfriend to death when he murdered another inmate in 1990. Experts who previously testified that he was faking mental retardation now say they were mistaken, and the us supreme court has agreed to consider his case in september. But it's not clear whether they will act if his execution is rescheduled before then.",

The department's existing stock of pentobarbital expired in march, and the guardian understands that the state has turned to an unidentified compounding pharmacy in another state to try and skirt around international controls. The ungainly spectacle of a us state desperately seeking a supply of pharmaceutical in order to kill a man provides a snapshot of the dire condition of the death penalty in many of the 32 states that still practice it. An international boycott of trade in medicines to corrections departments for use in executions, led by the european commission, has reduced stocks to such a low level that many states are struggling to carry out any executions at all.

Iran confirmed on sunday that it had executed the 38-year-old, who disappeared on a 2009 trip to saudi arabia, was named as a defector to the us months later, and returned to iran in july 2010 after surfacing in washington, claiming he had been kidnapped and interrogated by the cia. In reality, he appears to have been a genuine defector, who was warned by the cia that he would be hanged if he returned to his homeland but went back anyway because he missed his young son, and possibly feared for the boy's safety after threats from tehran, the new york times reports in a look back at what it calls a \" confusing, and at times heart-rending \" saga. After amiri returned to iran — and was photographed having a joyous reunion with his 7-year-old son — us authorities said he had been given $ 5 million to defect, but he left the money behind when he went home, fearing for his family's safety. The ap notes that amiri's case was apparently referred to in hillary clinton emails released by the state department. \" we have a diplomatic, ' psychological ' issue, not a legal one. Our friend has to be given a way out, \" wrote senior adviser jake sullivan just before amiri's return to tehran. \" he's free to go, \" wrote clinton. \" he was free to come. Those decisions are his alone to make. \" the times notes that weeks after his return, amiri disappeared. His mother told bbc farsi that a 10-year prison sentence was recently changed to death — and when the family was given his body, he had rope marks around his neck.",
