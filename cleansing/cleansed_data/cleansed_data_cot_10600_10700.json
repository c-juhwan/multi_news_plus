Police say kristopher amos, who lives down the street from gibson in columbus, ohio, asked candy arthurs and her two grandchildren to help him find a missing drone around 10pm on june 23, and the group went searching down an alley. Ten minutes later, gibson says she heard screams. Police say amos, a 29-year-old registered sex offender, stabbed arthurs in the heart as she tried to protect the children from him, reports the columbus dispatch. Bleeding heavily, arthurs \" pushed the children to safety, \" then followed them home, collapsing on the front step, police say. \" she's definitely a hero, \" gibson tells abc 7. \" she saved both of my kids ' lives that night. \" gibson says her 7-year-old son has recovered from a stab wound to the shoulder but is still \" traumatized. \" arthurs, 45, died of her injuries wednesday, the same day amos was arrested. Neighbors question why it took so long, but police say amos'resemblance to another sex offender living nearby initially complicated the case, per the dispatch. Neighbors also question why amos'two convictions of child enticement with a sexual motivation didn't require the community to be notified of his sex offender status. Nbc 4 reports children found a drone near the alley a day after the attack, but police say amos'story was only a ruse. He's charged with murder, with his bond set at $ 2.5 million.

Pop warner, the nation's biggest youth football league, has suspended coaches on a top california team accused of doing the same. The orange county register first reported the allegations, which claim that the coaches paid 10- and 11-year-olds $ 20 to $ 50 to go after stars on the other team and try to take them out of the game. A parent whistleblower says he saw one kid get cash after a game in which he gave an opponent a concussion. The story about the tustin red cobras is getting picked up nationally, by the wall street journal and usa today, among others. The team denies the charges. \" i have never paid a player to go out and hurt another player period, end of story, \" says the head coach.

        "summary": "Peat harvesters have been discovering well-preserved human remains in the bogs of england and throughout northern europe for centuries. Most date from about 700bc to 200ad, and they represent people of varying age, sex, and social status. But they do have one thing in common: violent deaths. Lots of theories have been floated for why the bog victims died, from accidental death to execution of criminals. In her book bog bodies uncovered, archaeologist miranda aldhouse-green argues in favor of human sacrifice, the atlantic reports. Forensic examinations of the bodies, the writings of classical authors, and other evidence all come together to suggest that the victims were ritually murdered and left in bogs to appease the gods, she writes. Some 1,000 bodies have been recovered from bogs, according to nautilus. Because they contain little oxygen and have a plant called sphagnum that inhibits bacteria, bogs offer a perfect preservative environment. Many of the bog bodies had physical deformities — a cauliflower ear, dwarfism, extra thumbs — leading aldhouse-green to speculate that \" visually special people \" may have been selected for sacrifice. The elaborateness of the killings — lindow man apparently took a blow to the head and then had his throat cut as he was being strangled with a cord, notes this bbc story — indicates they weren't ordinary murders. Also, cremation, rather than interment in bogs, was common during the iron age, and roman historians describe human sacrifice among the denizens of northern europe. However, even aldhouse-green concedes that classical historians are biased sources. Uncertainties notwithstanding, per the atlantic, \" the bog bodies are still with us, living a life they couldn't possibly have imagined in death. \" ( some of the world's oldest mummies have a big problem. )",

Generation x also graduated during a recession. It had even shittier jobs … generation x is used to being fucked over. \" i ' m older than noreen but younger than mat, and neither characterization rang exactly true to me ( most demographers place me and my peers at the tail end of generation x ). I was born during jimmy carter's presidency, a one-term administration remembered mostly for the iran hostage crisis, the new york city blackout, and stagflation. The carter babies — anyone born between his inauguration in january 1977 and reagan's in january 1981 — are now 30 to 34, and, like carter himself, the weirdly brilliant yet deeply weird born-again christian peanut farmer, this micro-generation is hard to pin down.

            "Detailed findings some of the best public transportation systems are often found in college towns. Universities are generally responsive to student demand and will often invest in their host city's transit system to provide the student body with access to the surrounding city and community. Unitrans, the public transportation system of davis, california, was founded in 1968 when the associated students of uc davis purchased two historic london double-decker buses to operate along two routes. The system was opened to the general public with partial funding from the city government in 1972. In champaign, illinois; bloomington, indiana; ithaca, new york; and davis — college towns where students comprise between 30 % and 50 % of the population — transit authorities encourage ridership by providing free fares to university students. In the united states, public transportation is divided along income lines. In 9 out of 10 urban areas, the median earnings for commuters who use public transit is less than the median earnings of commuters who drive alone. Nationwide, the typical public transit rider earns $ 4,000 less than the typical car commuter annually. In cities with quality public transit infrastructure, a diverse range of income levels ride the bus, train, or commuter rail. Many of the city's highest earners may rely on public transit to reach high-paying jobs in nearby metropolitan areas,"

A three-judge panel of the 2nd u.s.

The 2nd circuit and a lower court had previously ruled that saudi arabia was protected by sovereign immunity, which generally means that foreign countries can't be sued in american courts. But in its latest ruling, the 2nd circuit said a legal exception existed that would allow saudi arabia to remain as a defendant, just as afghanistan remained in the similar case. \" the procedural history of this case produced inconsistent results between two sets of plaintiffs suing for damages based on the same incident, \" the appeals court said in a decision written by circuit judge chester j.

            "A federal appeals court on thursday reinstated saudi arabia as a defendant in lawsuits claiming it provided support to al-qaida before the sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. A three-judge panel of the 2nd u.s. Circuit court of appeals said restoring saudi arabia was necessary to be consistent with a ruling by a different 2nd circuit panel that allowed another lawsuit to go forward in which a man sued afghanistan and other defendants for the death of his wife in the sept. 11 attacks. The 2nd circuit and a lower court had previously ruled that saudi arabia was protected by sovereign immunity, which generally means that foreign countries can't be sued in american courts. But in its latest ruling, the 2nd circuit said a legal exception existed that would allow saudi arabia to remain as a defendant, just as afghanistan remained in the similar case. \" the procedural history of this case produced inconsistent results between two sets of plaintiffs suing for damages based on the same incident, \" the appeals court said in a decision written by circuit judge chester j. Straub. \" we conclude that the circumstances here are ` extraordinary ' and warrant relief. \" an attorney representing saudi arabia said the panel's decision is \" contrary to settled law \" and will only result in a lower court throwing the case out for other reasons.

That changed this past weekend when officials called off the event at the last minute upon discovering that it was illegal in the eyes of police. In a facebook post on saturday, a day before the event was to take place in montreal, the canada national pro jiu-jitsu group announced the competition would be postponed until march 5 because police had threatened to arrest the 240 registered participants, aged 9 and up, reports the cbc. The reason: canada's criminal code states only combat sports recognized by the international olympic committee are allowed in the country. Jiu-jitsu is not in the ioc's program. However, event organizers say brazilian jiu-jitsu isn't a combat sport at all according to the criminal code definition of \" an encounter or fight with fists, hands, or feet. \" while punching and kicking is allowed in japanese jiu-jitsu, brazilian jiu-jitsu involves grappling, an organizer explains. \" for us, it was a huge shock because it was never a problem before, \" he says. Organizers say an attempt to notify police of the differences in the two sports proved fruitless, leaving them with no alternative but to postpone the tournament, a qualifying event for the abu dhabi world pro, per flograppling.com. Organizers say it will be moved to a city with a cooperative police force. Ctv news reports police in gatineau are amenable. ( a canadian cop sent to break up a \" fight \" instead got involved. )",

Peter paul rubens ' \" portrait of a gentleman \" was owned by a german-jewish doctor, who secreted it out of nazi germany when he fled in the 1930s. Patients hid his art for him, to avoid the looting that often befell jewish art collections, until he made arrangements to get safely to south africa; once there, the masterpiece hung on his wall until his death, quartz reports. Last year, the doctor's family approached an auction house about the painting they had always referred to as the \" funny old man, \" and last week news of its rediscovery surfaced. Rubens, one of europe's most influential and celebrated baroque painters, lived between 1577 and 1640. The oil on oak panel painting is believed to have been painted by the flemish master between 1598 and 1609, and has been in several countries with multiple owners since then.

        "summary": "For the first time since ebola was identified in 1976, the disease could become a persistent presence. Centers for disease control and prevention director robert redfield warned monday that the new outbreak in congo is so severe it may not be containable, the washington post reports. Most previous outbreaks have happened in remote areas, and all of them were brought under control before spreading widely and becoming entrenched. If the current outbreak, which has racked up almost 300 cases including 186 deaths as it enters its fourth month, becomes endemic in enough areas, \" this will mean that we've lost the ability to trace contacts, stop transmission chains, and contain the outbreak, \" said another expert at the capitol hill briefing where redfield spoke. That would mean the deadly virus could spread unpredictably, likely impacting travel and trade in a major way. The current outbreak is happening in an active war zone in congo, making it harder for teams to respond to the hemorrhagic fever — and making some people who are infected reluctant to visit treatment centers. One doctor recently wrote that this is the most challenging outbreak response he's seen in 18 years working in the region. Further complicating matters, health care workers are being infected — and it's already difficult for responders to track the cases, as 60 % to 80 % of them have no known epidemiological link to prior cases. The rate of new infections is also increasing. International public health experts need to prepare for the fact that this could \" [ become ] more of an endemic ebola outbreak in this region, which we've never really confronted, \" redfield said. ( she famously survived ebola, only to be killed in \" silent epidemic. \" )",

But she probably wasn't working out of her bathroom — unlike an ex-us ambassador to kenya who did just that. Ars technica resurfaces the 2012 story of scott gration, who balked at using the nairobi embassy's it and so reportedly set up shop in a bathroom there where he could access an unsecured network and use gmail. After he resigned in june 2012 over \" differences with washington regarding my leadership style, \" the new republic published an article in which it mentioned how staff members would have to sit on the toilet during meetings with him. A report released by the state department's inspector general in august of that year noted that gration himself ordered \" a commercial internet connection \" be installed in the bathroom. Gration may have set up his laptop in the loo for several reasons, writes sean gallagher for ars technica: maybe he didn't want his correspondence backed up on state servers, or perhaps the department's it was just so abysmal and/or unresponsive that gration just figured he'd diy it. Either way, the ambassador got chewed out in the report for \" willfully [ disregarding ] department regulations on the use of commercial email for official government business. \" he was given a chance to resign after being shown a draft of the report; the new republic reported that he took his case to the top echelons of the department, though not to clinton, to no avail.

Markus meechan posted the video, which he calls \" m8 yer dug's a nazi, \" on youtube in april, and it quickly went viral. The video now has more than a million views, including roughly 16,000 likes and 1,000 downvotes. In the video he repeatedly asks his girlfriend's dog, buddha, if the pug wants to \" gas the jews \" and teaches him to raise his paw to the command \" sieg heil, \" reports the scottish daily record. Meechan leads the video with the disclaimer, \" my girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is, so i thought i would come up with the least cute thing that i could think of, which is a nazi. \" he writes in a blog post that he was subsequently fired from his temp job at a call center, which he \" knew \" would happen, and he was ultimately slammed for his \" outrageous \" attitude, per the independent: \" everyone's going to actually think that i hate jews now and i don't at all. I ' m kind of panicked about it. Honestly, i don't hate anyone, the whole purpose of this was just to annoy my girlfriend. \" police say that there is \" no place for hate crime in scotland and police take all reports of incidents seriously. \" ( these neo-nazis shaved a swastika into their victim's hair. )",

A crowdfunded research group came to that conclusion after trolling for evidence of fukushima's unique radiation \" fingerprint \" in the pacific ocean, science reports via ut san diego. That radiation, now about 100 miles offshore, is roughly \" 1,000 times less than a single dental x-ray, \" says marine chemist ken buesseler, who led the study. \" it will not deter me from swimming in the pacific. \" that runs counter to what some experts call \" misinformation \" in california about the risk of taking the family to the beach. \" i see no reason to exaggerate what is happening, \" buesseler adds. His group found a maximum of two becquerels ( a measurement of radiation ) from japan in each cubic meter of pacific water. That's not much, compared to the estimated 7,000 trillion becquerels emitted during japan's meltdown and the 45.5 million becquerels found per cubic meter of water near japan, enough to give fish reproductive problems. And buesseler says that the fukushima radiation won't accumulate in top-level sea predators the way mercury does. For all this data, we can thank the conservation groups, universities, and government bodies who did the crowdfunding. \" in the us, no federal agency has taken on this task or supported independent scientists like ourselves to do this, \" he writes on reddit.

        "summary": "A us border patrol agent who claims he feared for his life after a rock hit his head reacted by shooting and killing the man who hurled the stone. It marks the ninth fatal shooting involving rock throwing since 2010. The unnamed agent was patrolling a smuggling trail east of san diego early tuesday when he came upon men suspected of crossing the border illegally; rocks were thrown at him, with one hitting his head. The san diego union-tribune describes one of them as being as large as a basketball, and many of the rest fist-sized. The ap reports that the incident fuels an ongoing debate over whether lethal force is justified as a response to rock attacks. The border patrol has long maintained that rocks are deadly weapons, and has rejected proposals that would prevent it from responding to them with deadly force. Under current policy, agents can use deadly force if they have a reasonable belief that their lives or the lives of others are in danger. Agents were attacked with rocks 185 times in the 2012 fiscal year, making it the no. 2 type of assault, according to the department of homeland security inspector general. They responded with gunfire 22 times and with less-than-lethal force — such as pepper spray and batons — 42 times. The rock-thrower, a noncitizen, was pronounced dead at the scene; it's unclear how many times he was shot, but the agent fired at least twice. The agent has been placed on paid administrative leave, reports the los angeles times.",

        "summary": "When boxed co-founder and ceo chieh huang first pitched his unconventional and highly generous benefits plan to investors a few years ago, some said, \" what the hell are you doing? \" his company, which takes on the likes of costco to offer low-cost online bulk purchases with two-day delivery and no membership fees, employs not just engineers fine-tuning a profitable formula, but warehouse workers packing the shipments. And he wanted all of them to have the same awesome perks, like unlimited parental leave and free weddings and tuition, reports bloomberg. As huang puts it, why should the \" people who move atoms \" be treated worse than those who \" move bits and bytes \"? huang, who is 35, grew up watching his parents, both immigrants from china, work tirelessly at menial jobs that paid poorly and offered no perks. And while it remains to be seen whether his generous benefits package will pay off, he says he's invested in a positive company culture that keeps employees happy and keeps the turnover rate down. He even spends considerable time at his four fulfillment centers, helping clean up and saying thank you to some of the several hundred people he employs. If the typically younger, higher-skilled staff who work at boxed's headquarters in manhattan complain about the lack of certain perks ( for example, huang eschews the ping pong tables of silicon valley ), he reminds them that \" the best thing that can happen for us in the long term is for boxed to be a success. \"",

In recent months that strategy has started to reach its limits. Companies from handy to instacart have battled lawsuits alleging contractors should be considered employees and receive more compensation.

The caveat: they won't turn the juice back on to all the water pumps for days or perhaps weeks as safety checks and repairs continue, and pumps for some of the reactors may be irreparably damaged. Still, just getting the lines hooked up is seen as a significant breakthrough, notes msnbc. At the very least, one control room now has working lights. Meanwhile, crews dumped tons of seawater on a boiling storage pool containing spent fuel rods and managed to cool it down to a more manageable level. That reduces the risk of more radiation leaking in the form of steam.",

Levels of radioactive iodine in some city tap water were two times the safety limit for infants, tokyo water bureau officials said. The officials told reporters that a water treatment center in downtown tokyo that supplies much of the city's tap water found that some water contained 210 becquerels per liter of iodine 131. They said the limit for consumption of iodine 131 for infants is 100 becquerels per liter. They recommended that babies not be given tap water, although they said the water is not an immediate health risk for adults. The announcement came as workers faced another day of struggle to cool damaged reactor cores at japan's earthquake-hit nuclear complex. The plant is still emitting radiation but the source is unclear, a senior u.n. Atomic agency official said. The international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) also raised concerns about a lack of information from japanese authorities, as rising temperatures around the core of one reactor threatened to delay work. \" we continue to see radiation coming from the site...

Now that fatwa, which is occasionally paraded out by the country's religious leaders, has been reupped yet again, and this time 40 state-controlled media groups are crowdfunding it, the guardian reports. The organizations raised about $ 600,000 at a media trade fair to add to the existing bounty, which is now said to run close to $ 4 million, per the new york times. \" imam khomeini's fatwa is a religious decree and it will never lose its power or fade out, \" iran's deputy culture minister tells the fars news agency, which shows a picture of rushdie, 68, with crosshairs on his forehead. The 27-year fatwa against rushdie — who once said living in hiding was like a \" comedy routine \" — was supposedly lifted in 1998 by ex-president mohammad khatami, but the religious faction said only the issuer could pull it back ( and khomeini died in 1989 ). After current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei took the country's reins, he decreed the fatwa was still in place. Meanwhile, an iranian journalist tells the times she believes the latest reminder about rushdie, who's lived a discreet, bodyguard-flanked lifestyle in new york city for more than a decade, is meant to be a distraction as elections near. Analysts say hard-liners want \" an electoral edge \" by keeping voters concentrating on other matters. ( a rushdie marriage proposal failed. )",

        "summary": "The los angeles times and washington post are out with complementary pieces focused on what they see as president trump's changing temperament in the wake of the midterms. At the los angeles times, eli stokols contrasts trump's frequent \" ebullient \" appearances at campaign rallies with a post-midterms retreat \" into a cocoon of bitterness and resentment, \" at least according to the administration sources he spoke with. The evidence stokols gives of that retreat: while past presidents have attended the annual asia summits, trump sent mike pence in his stead; he opted not to lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier on veterans day as is traditional; he had mike pompeo meet with jordan's king abdullah ii when he visited washington on tuesday; and he has decided not to join defense secretary jim mattis on a visit to the us-mexico border. Stokols'sources see these contributing factors: \" the certainty that the incoming democratic house majority will go after his tax returns and investigate his actions, and the likelihood of additional indictments by special counsel robert s. Mueller iii. \" read the article in full here. In an article for the washington post titled \" five days of fury, \" josh dawsey and philip rucker detail exactly that as based on interviews with \" 14 senior administration officials, outside trump confidants and foreign diplomats. \" they begin those five days last friday, with a call trump received from british prime minister theresa may, who offered her congratulations on the gop's wins; what she was allegedly greeted with in response was trump's \" especially foul mood \" as he brought up subjects like iran, brexit, and trade deals.

British prime minister theresa may was calling to celebrate the republican party's wins in the midterm elections — never mind that democrats seized control of the house — but her appeal to the american president's vanity was met with an ornery outburst.

May has endured trump's churlish temper before, but still her aides were shaken by his especially foul mood, according to u.s. And european officials briefed on the conversation. For trump, that testy call set the tone for five days of fury — evident in trump's splenetic tweets and described in interviews with 14 senior administration officials, outside trump confidants and foreign diplomats, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. \"he was frustrated with the trip. And he's itching to make some changes, \" said one senior white house official. \"this is a week where things could get really dicey. \" during his 43-hour stay in paris, trump brooded over the florida recounts and sulked over key races being called for democrats in the midterm elections that he had claimed as a \"big victory. \" he erupted at his staff over media coverage of his decision to skip a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of world war i. The president also was angry and resentful over french president emmanuel macron's public rebuke of rising nationalism, which trump considered a personal attack.

Australia is bracing itself for cyclone debbie, which is set to make landfall along the coast in queensland — that's the country's northeastern most state — after 7am local time tuesday, reports the bbc. That area is 14 hours ahead of edt, so us storm watchers should start paying attention after roughly 5pm edt on monday. Debbie is being hailed as \" a monster, \" bringing with it winds of up to 170mph, and there's the potential for a double whammy. Here's why, plus more storm coverage: the \" storm tide \" may be the biggest issue, according to new zealand's stuff. The bbc reports the cyclone may unfortunately sync up with high tide, which should peak at about 10.5 feet; the storm surge could tack on another 13. With the risk of flooding so high, evacuations are underway, with 25,000 people who live in the coastal city of mackay told to leave. \" this is probably the largest evacuation we've ever had to do, \" queensland premier annastacia palaszczuk says of mackay, per news.com.au. ( some sources put the potential mackay surge at closer to 8 feet. ) buzzfeed reports that other aussies are reacting \" in the most aussie way possible, \" and cites one woman who baked a cake that reads \" be kind debbie \" in icing. A bowen resident tells the australian he tried to bring a smile to his neighbors when he spray-painted the following on his fence: \" cyclone debbie bring it on. Bowen is not a pussy town do your best you got. \" as for how debbie will have to do its best, sky news reports projections have it downgrading to a category 2 storm ( that's winds of up to 110mph ) around 8pm local time. But things could get intense before then. The ap quotes palaszczuk as saying the farming region has never experienced a storm stronger than category 2, whose gusts top out at 102mph. Older homes won't be able to handle category 4, she says. Australia's abc reports debbie is projected to make landfall south of bowen, and explains the bowen area, which it describes as between mackay and townsville, is where the majority of australia's winter vegetables are grown. Projected potential damage: $ 1 billion. Debbie follows a relatively calm period: a record was set in january for the longest span ( 280 days, or a little more than 9 months ) without a hurricane-strength tropical system ( meaning maximum sustained winds of at least 74mph ) in what weather.com describes as \" any of the three major",

For example, using what3words'system, the address for the white house is sulk.held.raves. Anyone can download the free what3words app to make themselves easier to find, post &amp; parcel reports.

Lack of addresses is an acute problem in mongolia, where a quarter or so of the population is nomadic and not even all the streets in the capital have names. Mongolians often have to give landmark-based directions to delivery drivers over the phone or travel miles to the nearest post office to get their mail. \"failed deliveries are commonplace, inconveniencing citizens, holding back the operations of both businesses and government, and raising the cost of deliveries, \" rhys jones says. Starting in july, mongolians will be able to write a three-word phrase as an address and gps will guide mongol post workers right to their door.

            "Welp, that settles that. Anybody who was wondering if authorities were going to keep going after the arrest of silk road kingpin ross ulbricht and start targeting users don't need to wonder anymore. Multiple arrests have now been made worldwide, and it looks like more are on the way. This new wave of arrests knows no borders. Feds charged a 40-year-old washington man believed to have been in \" top one percent of sellers \" on silk road along with his roommate for selling methamphetamine, heroin and cocaine — including one particular blend called \" 1980s time machine. \" meanwhile, four users in the united kingdom were taken in for drug charges, and a pair of men in sweden were arrested for selling pot on silk road. Advertisement it's unclear how related to ross ulbricht's case this latest wave of arrests is. Common sense suggests that the fbi could have easily used data on silk roads servers which they managed to physically track down and seize. In the uk, it was not local police who are going after the suspected silk road drug dealers but rather the national crime agency, a new organization that more or less amounts to a british fbi.

Among the criticisms of macdonald's thr sit-down: he criticized hannah gadsby's nanette special without seeing it, and he didn't realize how bad racism was until he saw sacha baron cohen's who is america. But the remarks drawing the most backlash are his criticisms of the me too movement: he says he's \" happy \" it's \" slowed down, \" as he feels it's morphed into \" i believe all women. \" he goes on to lament that stars like chris hardwick and louis ck ( as well as roseanne barr ) have been unable to simply \" admit wrongdoing \" and then receive a \" second chance. Now ( the model is ) admit wrongdoing and you're finished. \" \" there are very few people that have gone through what they have, losing everything in a day, \" he says of louis ck and barr. \" of course, people will go, ' what about the victims? ' \" he adds. \" but you know what? the victims didn't have to go through that. \" comic artie lange defended macdonald, noting he was just supporting his friends, and pointing out louis ck never assaulted anyone. Others pushed back on that, saying some women comics lost their careers because of ck's behavior. Macdonald apologized tuesday night, tweeting his two \" very good friends \" louis ck and barr \" made terrible mistakes and i would never defend their actions. If my words sounded like i was minimizing the pain that their victims feel to this day, i am deeply sorry. \" that didn't stop nbc from pulling him from tuesday's tonight show, per the new york times, saying the cancellation came \" out of sensitivity to our audience and in light of … macdonald's comments in the press today. \"",

The british businessman and art collector says he bought a $ 2-million andy warhol painting for only $ 5 at a las vegas garage sale two years ago, the daily mail reports. In fact, he hardly noticed it until framing other pictures — then \" recognized the bright red lips of an andy warhol, \" he tells the bbc. But the mail says doubts remain about the authenticity of the painting — a portrait of 1930s actor rudy vallee — which warhol allegedly painted at age 11 or 12. Why, for example, is it signed \" andy warhol \" when the painter only changed his name from andrew warhola in 1949? because, says fields, warhol signed his early paintings later in life. And fields claims several experts have verified the painting as original. Also, he prefers to have it hung in a gallery rather than sold for megabucks. The work \" moves the birth of pop art back two decades, \" he says, \" showing warhol was already doing that sort of stuff at a far younger age. \"",

Christine was seen on a walgreens surveillance video monday morning, per wfaa; records also show she went to a local mcdonald's a few hours later — the last purchase authorities have been able to track. Brandon says he texted his wife on his way home from work monday, but he wasn't alarmed when she didn't reply because he figured she was busy with the kids. When he got home and found the house empty, he tried calling her — and her cellphone rang in an adjoining room. He says everything in the house was intact. \" started getting worried when it got to 8 o ' clock, now nothing. Nine o ' clock, 10 o ' clock, stayed up all night, of course, \" he tells nbc 5.

            "For too long, the media has ignored the relationship between hollywood and the pentagon. Knowing this, i figured my washington post piece would vanish into the ether. However, to my surprise, it came out in the same week that the los angeles times and wall street journal provided stunning new details about how the shadowy relationship between hollywood and the pentagon is setting new standards for government-subsidized propaganda. Hollywood as complicit as ever first and foremost, both the times and journal tells us that collusion between the military and hollywood - including allowing pentagon officials to line edit scripts - is once again on the rise, with new television programs and movies slated to celebrate the navy seals. They also give us up-to-date proof that major hollywood directors remain more than happy to ideologically slant their films in precisely the pro-war, pro-militarist direction that the pentagon demands in exchange for taxpayer-subsidized access to military hardware. The journal, for instance, quotes director peter berg saying that his upcoming cinematic tribute to the seals was approved by pentagon-compliant studio execs specifically because the project avoids any nuanced take on the politics of war. \" the idea of a good old-fashioned combat yarn, in which the politics are very clear - we support these men - was more appealing to them, \" he said, noting that his film will be \" an unabashed tribute to the courage of ( the seals ). \" likewise, the times reports that after facing questions about inappropriate hollywood-government collusion on a film to glorify the mission to kill osama bin laden, director kathyrn bigelow issued a defensive statement reiterating that her film will not dare raise any thorny questions the pentagon doesn't want raised - questions such as whether the mission was \" kill only \" and whether bin laden could have been captured. \" ( the mission ) was an american triumph, both heroic and nonpartisan, and there is no basis to suggest that our film will represent this enormous victory otherwise, \" she said, no doubt deliberately reassuring the pentagon officials that she plans to produce exactly what they want. This, of course, is the top gun effect in action. With taxpayer-subsidized access to pentagon hardware so crucial for filmmakers, and with the pentagon so aggressively permitting and denying such access on the basis of a filmmakers ' loyalty to a pro-militarist message, directors like berg, bigelow and others know that"

        "summary": "Some 15 cities along a 200-mile stretch of the pacific northwest were coated in a mysterious, chalky substance on feb. 6 after \" milky rain \" fell from the sky. For months, the white substance has been considered a \" good old-fashioned weather mystery, \" per cnn. Now, it's a mystery no longer. Though some have suggested a nevada dust storm or ash from wild fires or far off volcanoes was responsible, washington state university scientists who analyzed samples of the rain along with meteorological data say the guilty party is a shallow saline lake 480 miles away in oregon. Soil from summer lake was thrown into the air by a bad dust storm and carried north by strong winds. When the clouds opened up, the particles fell to the ground with rain over various parts of oregon, washington, and idaho, the scientists explain in a press release. \" at first we suspected it was related to wind erosion of landscapes that had previously burned, but the wind trajectory analyses didn't add up, \" a researcher says. Wind patterns showed the substance couldn't have come from suspected volcanic eruptions in russia and mexico, either. \" instead, the air flow was locally from the south, \" a meteorologist says. The scientists traced the milky matter to summer lake — known to dry up during droughts, christian science monitor reports — where 60mph winds were recorded the night before the rain poured. \" that would have been powerful enough to lift a good-size dust plume, \" the meteorologist says. The tri-city herald reports samples included sodium, silicon, and trace amounts of aluminum, potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, and manganese. \" the chemistry is consistent with a saline source from a dry lake bed, \" a hydrochemist adds.

        "summary": "The allegation that former house speaker dennis hastert sexually abused a teenage boy as an illinois high school teacher and wrestling coach is apparently just the tip of the iceberg. Three others have also accused hastert of sexual abuse, including two males identified by the chicago tribune, one of whom is dead. Stephen reinboldt was allegedly abused by hastert while serving as a team equipment manager at yorkville high school a few years after hastert began teaching in 1965. He died of aids in 1995, but his sister says he told her in 1980 that his first same-sex experience was with hastert. Another accuser, a former student athlete known as individual d, alleges he was abused late in hastert's career at the school. He plans to provide a victim-impact statement to be read at hastert's sentencing hearing on april 27. Initial accuser individual a — a relative of one of hastert's friends — listed hastert as a reference for his first job in the 1980s, but he quit because of a crippling anxiety disorder, per the tribune. He and his wife eventually fell into debt, which may explain why hastert began paying him off via illegal cash withdrawals to which hastert pleaded guilty last year; the statute of limitations for any sexual crimes has expired. \" mr. Hastert has made mistakes in judgment and committed transgressions for which he is profoundly sorry, \" his lawyer says. He adds hastert has \" deteriorated both physically and emotionally, undoubtedly in part due to public shaming and humiliation, \" nearly died of sepsis in november, and now requires 24-hour care, per politico. Hastert's lawyers are asking for probation, while prosecutors are seeking up to six months in jail.",

The 33-year-old valbuena and 37-year-old castillo died late thursday when their suv crashed as it tried to veer around an object on the road, yaracuy state governor julio leon heredia said on his twitter account. Officials said some bandits place or throw objects on highways to force vehicles to stop or crash so they can rob the occupants. Heredia said four people have been detained after being found with property of the athletes. Valbuena and castillo were teammates on the cardenales de lara team in the venezuelan winter league and were returning from a game in the capital when the crash occurred en route to the city of barquisimeto. Third baseman carlos rivero was in the car and survived, according to the website beisbolplay. Cardenales de lara players carry the caskets of teammates of luis valbuena and jose castillo at the team's stadium in barquisimeto, venezuela, on friday.

            "Luis valbuena, the charismatic, bat-flipping third baseman who played an integral part on the astros 2015 wild card team, died in a car accident following a winter ball game in his native venezuela on thursday along with former astro jose castillo. The news was confirmed by the cardinals of lara, a venezuelan winter ball team for whom both men played a game on thursday. Valbuena was 33 and castillo was 37. According to reports in venezuela, the car transporting valbuena and castillo hit a rock in the road. Four men were arrested in connection with the accident, julio leon heredia — the governor of yaracuy — announced friday afternoon. Heredia told meridiano.com that the four men were found with some of valbuena and castillo's belongings. It is customary, heredia said, for criminals or gangs to place large rocks in the middle of the street in hopes of either stopping or overturning vehicles to rob those inside. We are so very deeply saddened to learn of the passing of former astros players luis valbuena and jose castillo. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones.

Clinton then dictated to colbert his first ( and so far only ) tweet: \" just spent amazing time with colbert! is he sane? he is cool! #cgiu \" the exchange came during a live interview colbert conducted saturday to close out the annual clinton global initiative university event for college students, cnn explains. Afterward, off-camera, colbert took the rare step of dropping character for a q&a, the washington examiner reports. Whereas during the show colbert had jokingly introduced the \" colbert galactic initiative \" ( to one-up clinton's global one ), in the q&a he said that if he had an initiative \" it would be something with child poverty \" or global hunger. He was also asked about his recent habit of campaigning for his sister out-of-character, and replied that he was willing to \" break the jewel of my own career \" to help her.",

        "summary": "A flurry of new stories are out about the investigation of possible ties between russia and president trump, and specifically about the controversial dossier compiled by a former british intelligence officer at the heart of the matter. One name in particular is gaining prominence, that of mikhail kalugin, a russian diplomat who worked in dc but is now back in moscow. The bbc thinks he's a russian spy who coordinated the financing of russian hackers. A look at the coverage: overview: vanity fair has a lengthy primer on how christopher steele, the former british agent, compiled his dossier and then decided to put it in the hands of reporters when he felt it wasn't being taken seriously by the fbi. The piece also recounts a clandestine meeting between steele and a former state department official, who received the dossier and turned it over to john mccain, who in turn handed it over to the fbi. Read it here. Kalugin: steele wrote of him in his dossier, though he misspelled the name: \" a leading russian diplomat, mikhail kulagin, had been withdrawn from washington at short notice because moscow feared his heavy involvement in the us presidential election operation … would be exposed in the media there. \" his role: a bbc report says it has confirmed that kalugin was, in fact, no mere diplomat but a russian spy. Mcclatchy previously reported that he went back to moscow in august as federal investigators examined his role in the hacking. He allegedly hid payments to the russian hackers through veterans ' pension benefits, though he denies all of this. Trump connection? the bbc quotes anonymous sources as saying that once hackers got information on democrats, along with voter rolls, the russians would have needed to coordinate with the trump campaign to disseminate the information to carefully targeted groups of voters. \" this is the ' big picture'some accuse the fbi of failing to see, \" writes paul wood. Source d: one of steele's key sources, identified as \" source d \" in his dossier, is sergei millian, a belorussian-american businessman profiled by the washington post. He provided steele with some of the more volatile accusations, including claims that moscow was blackmailing trump. How trustworthy is he? \" by his own evolving statements, sergei millian is either a shrewd businessman with high-level access to both trump's inner circle and the kremlin, or a bystander unwittingly caught up in a global controversy, \" per the post. Its conclusion is that \" he is little of both. \" read the full piece here. Steele to dc? the senate intelligence committee is negotiating to have steele",
