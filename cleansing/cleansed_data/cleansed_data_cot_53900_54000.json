        "summary": "To snip or not to snip? male circumcision carries \" low \" risks but has \" dramatic \" benefits, according to draft guidelines released by the cdc yesterday. The long-awaited guidelines say that the procedure can greatly reduce the risk of hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases for heterosexual men, reports reuters, which notes that circumcision rates have dropped 10 % to 58 % over the last three decades. Circumcision is a personal decision, and the guidelines will stop short of recommending all newborn boys undergo the procedure, but \" the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks, \" a cdc spokesman tells the ap. The cdc says that circumcision can reduce the risk of a man getting hiv or herpes from a female partner by around 50 %. It also makes sex safer for female partners, although it doesn't appear to reduce the risk of contracting stds during anal sex with other men. The draft guidelines — which will face stiff opposition from anti-circumcision groups — say the risk of complications from circumcision is only 0.5 % for newborns, reports the los angeles times. That rises to 9 % among children, then drops to 5 % among adults, though the guidelines — which say circumcised men \" generally report minimal or no change in sexual satisfaction or function \" — note that waiting for a boy to reach adolescence or adulthood lets him choose for himself.

        "summary": "Religions throughout the world — and throughout history — have put dreams at the center of their belief systems, and researchers say there's a good reason for that. We do much of our intense dreaming during rem sleep, when the highly active brain acts almost like it's awake, writes ross pomeroy at real clear science. All that activity can lead to dreamed situations that feel very real — in some cases, even religious. In a new paper in frontiers in psychology, a neurologist and theological scholar argue that dreams are well-suited to create experiences in which we believe we've spoken to a deity of some kind. That is in part due to the feeling of an alternative reality we get in dreams, the researchers say. What's more, in dreams, we often ascribe emotions and thoughts to those we believe we're encountering. We give them an \" exaggerated degree of agency \" because our dreaming brains have trouble understanding our thoughts as our own, the researchers write. The researchers also note that unclear boundaries between rem sleep and wakefulness can be linked to schizophrenia — but at gizmodo, annalee newitz notes that the feeling of \" hearing voices \" may not necessarily mean a person is dealing with mental illness. A recent survey found that 15 % of respondents who say they've heard voices have no diagnosis of disorder, and the \" hearing \" involved isn't necessarily auditory; the voices may not feel as though they're external at all, researchers say.

In fact, \" the sun's north pole has already changed sign, while the south pole is racing to catch up. \" the peak of the cycle usually is associated with an increase in sunspots and solar flares, but this year's peak is relatively tame.

The airline has fully restored all its long-haul services out of heathrow following saturday's crippling it failure, but monday marks the third day of related delays and cancellations, particularly when it comes to short-haul flights. The ap reports ba axed 27 flights on monday, and sister airlines iberia and air nostrum cancelled more than 320. The airline didn't offer much in the way of details until monday when in an interview with sky news, ceo alex cruz faulted a power surge. The independent reports cruz also said the backup system didn't kick in as it should have. Cruz brushed away a british union's assertions that the root of the it issue stretches back a year, when \" hundreds \" of it staffers lost their jobs, per the union gmb, with the work outsourced to india. Cruz countered that \" they've all been local issues around a local data center who have been managed and fixed by local resources. \" but that doesn't stop the bbc from speculating that for ba's \" disaster recovery plan \" to have worked, \" veteran staff with knowledge of the complex patchwork of systems built up over the years \" would be key, and it's possible some of those people left during last year's shift to india. Gmb isn't the only one needling the airline. Mashable reports budget airline ryanair has been poking fun on twitter. In one tweet, it proclaims, \" breaking news: ba appoints new head of it.... #shouldhaveflownryanair \"; the picture above features the line \" computer says no. \" see its other tweet here.",

The weapon used should have been fake or empty; instead, knowlton was hit. The washington post reports by way of her facebook page that knowlton was a long-time librarian in minnesota who had relocated to punta gorda, where she was part of the friends of the punta gorda library board of directors. The name of the officer who shot her has not been released, but he is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The post reports that for three decades, citizen police academies have been offered throughout the us; per decade-old justice department stats, about 15 % of surveyed police departments had such academies. Said lewis of the \" unimaginable event \": \" if you pray, please pray for mary's family, and for the officers who were involved.

Today's unveiling is sony's attempt to steal the spotlight, at least until microsoft unveils its next xbox in june at the e3 video game expo in los angeles. Among the ps4's revisions is an updated controller that adds a touchpad, motion control, and a \" share \" button. The controller also features a light bar, which means a new playstation camera can more easily track the device. Sony has struggled lately to keep up with microsoft and other rivals such as apple and samsung. The company is promising nifty mobile devices, sophisticated digital cameras, and other gadgetry as part of its comeback effort. More details at gizmodo and techcrunch.",

As for the airstrikes, targeted ones may be necessary near the mountain to \" break the siege \" there, says obama, and allow more help to arrive and avert a \" genocide. \" the bigger reason for the possible airstrikes, however, seems to be to halt the advance of the extremist fighters in the north. ' line in the sand ': though the us did not intervene as the islamic state swept across much of iraq in recent weeks, the city of irbil in northern iraq \" appears to be a line in the sand, \" writes dan lamothe in the washington post. It's the kurdish capital, and the us has diplomats and military advisers stationed there among the american allies. ( the islamic state also reportedly controls the country's largest dam, in the northern city of mosul. ) how far? \" the question arises: how far is mr. Obama willing to go? \" writes peter baker in the new york times. Obama said \" there is ' no american military solution'to the iraqi insurgency, pointing again to the need for a new politically inclusive government in baghdad. What he might do if that fails he did not say. And while aides stressed this is a narrow mission, they acknowledged scenarios in which it could expand. \" reversal: \" the return to military engagement in iraq is a reversal for mr. Obama, whose early opposition to the war that toppled saddam hussein, and his promise to end it, fueled his long-shot campaign for the white house, \" write carol e. Lee and felicia schwartz at the wall street journal. \" it also puts a spotlight on what has become a familiar feature of the obama presidency, in which the leader of the most powerful military in the world has become defined by his reluctance to use it. \" unity after all? \" ironically, isis's campaign against the kurds may end up helping unify the iraqi state, \" writes joshua keating at slate. The kurds have long been at odds with nouri al-maliki's government, but now he's ordering his air force to help them. \" iraq's various factions, as well as baghdad's odd-couple patrons, iran and the united states, may be forced to work together to confront the most serious threat the country has faced",

Though the bill largely follows the white house outline, lawmakers tacked on an extension of subsidies for ethanol and alternative energy sources to sweeten the deal for democrats. The previously-reticent harry reid is now behind the bill, and predicts it ' ll pass with nearly all republicans and many democrats supporting it. The house, on the other hand, is in open revolt; yesterday, in a closed-door session, democrats were actually chanting \"just say no, \" as they voted against bringing the proposal to the floor. \" if it's'take it or leave it, ' we ' ll leave it, \" one democrat told the ap. But a reid spokesman had this to say about the house: \"this vote demonstrates they may be irrelevant to this process. \"",

        "summary": "It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day. That would be aug. 28, 2005, one day before hurricane katrina devastated new orleans. National weather service meteorologist robert ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist james spann in a tweet commemorating the ricks forecast. As it turns out, ricks was spot on. \" most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks … perhaps longer, \" he wrote. \" at least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail … leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed. \" and this: \" water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards. \" ( spann's tweet includes the full text. ) the forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the smithsonian museum of american history, as noted by slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told brian williams of nbc news on sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \" i would much rather have been wrong in this one, \" he told williams. \" i would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf. But our local expertise said otherwise. You know, ' hey, let's gear up for the big one, this is going to be the big one. ' \" ( read about what jj watt's crowdsourced fundraiser accomplished in the wake of hurricane harvey. )",

In houston early monday, thousands of people lined up at a voting location hours before early voting began, the houston chronicle reports. Authorities say early voting turnout has been much higher than in 2014 across the state's biggest counties. Renée cross, senior director for the hobby school of public affairs at the university of houston, tells the texas tribune that the numbers are \" very impressive. \" \" we see so much anger or enthusiasm about candidates in much higher numbers than we've ever seen, \" she says. \" from a political standpoint, i think there's just as much energy that we've seen in presidential years. \" in other election news: trump praises \" beautiful ted. \" president trump appeared at a houston rally for sen. Ted cruz on monday, where both men made it clear the bitterness of the 2016 campaign was behind them. Before he flew to texas, trump told reporters that he now called cruz \" beautiful ted \" or \" texas ted \" instead of \" lyin'ted, \" reports the washington post. At the rally, the two men embraced and cruz told the crowd that he is looking forward to hitting the campaign trail for trump's re-election bid in 2020. Trump described cruz's opponent, beto o ' rourke, as \" overrated. \" \" you know what i am? i ' m a nationalist. \" at the cruz rally, trump attacked democrats as a \" big risk to the american family \" and accused them of \" encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and overwhelm our nation, \" the ap reports. He also attacked globalists, declaring himself to be a nationalist. Gop may have the edge in early voting. According to data analyzed by nbc news, talk of a \" blue wave \" may be overstated: in early voting, republican-affiliated voters have outnumbered democrats in arizona, florida, georgia, indiana, montana, tennessee, and texas, while democrats are ahead in nevada. Trump \" plans to distance himself from gop losses. \" insiders tell politico that while trump is currently describing the midterm vote as a vote on his presidency, he plans to break with recent precedent and distance himself from the results if there are serious gop losses. The sources say trump is likely to blame losses on house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell — as well as the media.

The company, cynk, runs a website called introbiz.com designed to help connect people with celebrities and various kinds of professionals. Fair enough — until its stock leaped by 25,000 % since june, notes business insider. Worse, the company address in belize city, belize, is inaccurate ( cynk apologized ) and the company's shares have swapped hands three times over six years, always between people who were the ceo and sole employee. More details: business insider found someone matching ceo javier romero on facebook and called him up. He answered to javier until the reporter identified herself, when he said he was really jason. Javier is \" actually out right now, \" he said. \" i don't really want to disclose his business. I can definitely get a number for you guys. \" stock manipulation in the penny market is \" extremely common \" and hard to regulate, an expert tells bloomberg. Another says that \" one percent \" of investors would trade in a company like cynk — but stock promoters hardly helped, raving on twitter that the stock \" keeps surging higher!! \" and \" this could be epic!! \" the sec probe is part of its recent crackdown on penny-stock fraud. Over the past two years, the commission has halted trading in over 1,300 companies. The blog zero hodge drew attention to the stock this week, quipping, \" lord overstone said it best.

But the details that have been confirmed are pretty jarring: lavoie lost nearly half his body weight and had begun to suffer from hypothermia, having weathered snow and temps below freezing. He was essentially unable to eat, drink, or speak when he was found, having been spotted by helicopter along the nottaway river on wednesday, nine days after a missing persons report was filed ( as an experienced outdoorsman, lavoie's family wasn't initially concerned when he didn't return as scheduled ). Lavoie is expected to recover after what will likely be weeks spent on an iv, and police are waiting to talk to him about his experience.

        "summary": "In what discover calls a \" unique and touching paper \" published in the journal neurology thursday, robin williams ' widow shares the heartbreaking story of her husband's final 10 months and asks neurologists not to give up in their quest toward brain disease cures. Susan schneider williams refers to lewy body disease, the neurodegenerative disorder that ultimately led to williams'suicide in august 2014, as \" the terrorist inside my husband's brain. \" she describes how, toward the end of his life, \" robin was losing his mind and he was aware of it. \" he was struggling with paranoia, anxiety, delusions, insomnia, and other symptoms both physical and mental, and for months, he and his wife could get no answers about what was happening to him. He was ultimately diagnosed with parkinson's disease, but as his symptoms continued to worsen, he grew \" weary \" and it felt like they were both \" drowning. \" then, ultimately, he took his own life. It was only after his death that an autopsy revealed williams actually had lewy body disease — his clinical symptoms mirrored parkinson's, but his brain pathology showed that almost all of the neurons throughout his brain and brainstem had been besieged by lewy bodies, schneider williams writes. When she found out, she wasn't surprised: \" the mere fact that something had invaded nearly every region of my husband's brain made perfect sense to me, \" she writes. She has spent the time since williams'death learning all she can about lewy body disease, for which there is no cure, and she now serves on the board of directors for the american brain foundation. Her full piece is worth a read.",

Why it's important for this myth to be shattered, scientists say, is because companies and educators have been urged to revamp their processes and environments to cater to the supposedly more tech-savvy younger generation, quartz notes. \" the answer is not how we can adapt [ to the younger generation ], \" says lead author paul kirschner, an open university educational psychology professor. \" we have to treat people as human, cognitive learners and stop considering one specific group to have special powers. \" previous studies have suggested digital immigrants — those born before the early ' 80s and, as nature puts it, thought to be \" doomed to be forever strangers in a computer-based strange land \" — can handle technological tasks as well as the younger set. In fact, every generation has trouble multitasking ( think emailing and watching tv at the same time ) because our brains just aren't equipped to fully concentrate on multiple tasks at once. Even marc prensky, the educator who first popularized the terms \" digital native \" and \" digital immigrants \" in a 2001 essay, is now moving away from those labels and embracing the term \" digital wisdom, \" which he says we can all aspire to. \" the digital natives/digital immigrants metaphor is not about what people know, or can do, with technology, \" his site notes. \" it's more about culture and attitudes. \" ( not taking anything away from this 4-year-old, though. )",

In one of the messages, william tells kate he was nearly shot by blanks while going through military training, cnn reports. The court also heard an intercepted voicemail of prince harry's, in which william spoke in falsetto, pretending to be harry's then-girlfriend chelsy davy. In total, glenn mulcaire, the private investigator who has pleaded guilty to phone hacking in the case, recorded about eight messages, the prosecution says.",

Individuals with autism spectrum disorders often have trouble engaging and interacting in social situations, frequently avoiding eye contact, for example, and previous research has also shown that people who are autistic often have lower levels of the hormone oxytocin.

Sac actun's underwater cave system now absorbs dos ojos, becoming the record-setting, 216-mile-long sac actun system, reuters reports. According to national geographic, it's now 49 miles longer than the previous record holder and could get even bigger as divers continue to seek connections to other flooded cave systems in the area. \" this immense cave represents the most important submerged archaeological site in the world, since it has more than a hundred archaeological contexts, \" the project's director, guillermo de anda, says. Those contexts include extinct animals and possibly signs of the first american settlers, but also new information about the ancient maya civilization. \"it allows us to appreciate much more clearly how the rituals, the pilgrimage sites, and ultimately the great pre-hispanic settlements that we know emerged, \" de anda tells reuters. Sinkholes leading to underground caves had religious significance to the maya, and de anda's project has found ancient walls, staircases, and paintings in some of the caves that aren't completely flooded.

An article about ruemmler's love for flashy shoes. Wait, what? it seems the shoe habit initially got two paragraphs in a more serious profile of ruemmler and the irs scandal, but the shoes were just so interesting they ended up getting their own article. This, writes irin carmon on salon, is the perfect \" tale of being a woman in public life, \" and it's just as ridiculous as the time the same paper described a congresswoman as \" hectoring \" and \" pouty, \" or the time vogue became obsessed with kirsten gillibrand's weight loss, or the time... Well, you get the idea. \" the washington post is still one of the country's major papers, there are still far too few women in positions of power in the city it mainly covers, and at a time when ruemmler is in the spotlight for whether she did her job right, the shoe chatter is simply undermining and trivializing, \" carmon writes. Studies have shown that hearing descriptions of a female political candidate's appearance — even positive descriptions — damages the candidate in a voter's eyes, while the same effect is not seen for men. Plus, politics is still a boys ' club. \" so here is a proposal for the politics reporters who want to add color and ' fabulousness'to their prose: how about we issue a moratorium until there's more than one woman in the room, and see what happens? \" click for carmon's full piece.",

The bear caught up and knocked the boy down, at which point his parents \" deployed bear spray about 5 feet from the bear's face. \" the bear then \" shook its head \" and retreated. The boy was taken to a local clinic, then to montana's big sky medical center, where he was treated for wounds to his buttocks, a hurt wrist, and puncture wounds on his back. Park officials say they're trying to figure out what type of bear attacked him, with fox news noting both black bears and grizzlies live in the park. The casper star-tribune reports there have been a handful of other animal attacks at yellowstone this year, including by bison and cow elk.

Now ryan mendoza says it's time for the home to return to the us, per the detroit free press. He cites the recent racial violence in virginia and the rippling effects of the removal of confederate statues around the us, making the case that parks ' home would provide a powerful counterpoint. \" there are very, very few monuments to the civil rights movement, \" he tells the free press. The big hitch, however, is getting someone, or some institution, to pay for its relocation. Mendoza says that detroit's cultural institutions don't seem interested, raising the prospect that the home could end up in a museum elsewhere in the country. So far, one group — the nash family foundation in new york — has pledged up to $ 40,000, but while other institutions have expressed interest in displaying the 21-by-21-foot-long home, actual monetary offers aren't following. Mendoza says he's spent about $ 130,000 to move and restore the house, though the interior work isn't yet complete. \" i ' m fond of the house, \" he tells nbc news, \" but this house has to go back to the united states, and now is the time. \" ( the late founder of little caesar's quietly paid parks'rent for years. )",

Video by by frank witsil, dfp. Wochit artist ryan mendoza poses in front of the rebuilt house of rosa parks in berlin on april 6, 2017. ( photo: markus schreiber, associated press ) detroit — the american artist who saved a detroit home that civil rights icon rosa parks once lived in by moving it to germany last year now wants to bring it back to detroit. \"if you look at the current situation in america, you have all of these monuments to the confederacy — which are monuments to slavery, \" the 45-year-old artist, ryan mendoza, said in an interview sunday with the detroit free press. \"there are very, very few monuments to the civil rights movement, which is antithetical to that. \" but, mendoza said, detroit's cultural institutions, so far, have shown little interest in bringing the house back. Instead, the house may likely end up in a museum or venue elsewhere in the u.s. — such as washington, d.c., or new york. The artist, who lives in germany, said it is time for parks ' home to return to the u.s. As communities here debate what should happen to confederate monuments and memorials, and some fear that white nationalism is on the rise.

Video by by frank witsil, dfp. Wochit artist ryan mendoza poses in front of the rebuilt house of rosa parks in berlin on april 6, 2017. ( photo: markus schreiber, associated press ) detroit — the american artist who saved a detroit home that civil rights icon rosa parks once lived in by moving it to germany last year now wants to bring it back to detroit. \"if you look at the current situation in america, you have all of these monuments to the confederacy — which are monuments to slavery, \" the 45-year-old artist, ryan mendoza, said in an interview sunday with the detroit free press. \"there are very, very few monuments to the civil rights movement, which is antithetical to that. \" but, mendoza said, detroit's cultural institutions, so far, have shown little interest in bringing the house back. Instead, the house may likely end up in a museum or venue elsewhere in the u.s. — such as washington, d.c., or new york. The artist, who lives in germany, said it is time for parks ' home to return to the u.s. As communities here debate what should happen to confederate monuments and memorials, and some fear that white nationalism is on the rise.

The researchers used stem cells that grew into ear cartilage, shaping the cells into an ear by putting them in \" biological tubing, \" discovery news reports. More specifically, they used \" induced pluripotent stem cells, \" which the national institutes of health explains are \" adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell-like state. \" the ear-shaped cartilage was implanted under a rat's skin, where it was allowed to grow for two months; the tubing dissolved and a 2-inch-long ear was left behind. The researchers believe this technology could be used to treat people who are born with no ears or with smaller-than-normal ears, japan today reports. It could also be used to repair ears disfigured in accidents, discovery adds. In the case of a child born with a missing or misshapen ear, the researchers note that the ear they created is \" living, \" and thus would develop and grow along with the child. A clinical trial involving humans is expected to start in five years. In 2013, researchers in boston used sheep cells, bovine collagen, and an ear-shaped titanium wire frame to grow an ear on the back of another rat, discovery notes.

They filled a plastic tube with the diameter of about 3 millimeters with the balls. Using three such tubes, the researchers shaped a human ear and implanted it onto the back of a rat. In about two months, the tubes dissolved, leaving behind on the animal's back what looks like a 5-centimeter human ear.

        "summary": "Way to go, humanity. For the first time in history, human-induced climate change has been found \" solely or primarily \" responsible for the extinction of a mammal species, according to a new study. The bramble cay melomys, or mosaic-tailed rat, was found by europeans on a tiny coral cay off the coast of queensland, australia, in 1845 and became known as the only mammal species endemic to the great barrier reef, reports the guardian. But though there were hundreds still in existence on bramble cay in 1978, the last were spotted by a fisherman in 2009, reports afp. Researchers from the university of queensland and the queensland government — who traveled to bramble cay in 2014 and laid 150 traps for six nights to no avail — say \" the only known population of this rodent is now extinct. \" researchers found the cay, which sits about 10 feet above sea level, had flooded several times, wiping out the animals and their habitat. Just 2.5 hectares of land remained above high tide, reports newsweek. \" significantly, this probably represents the first recorded mammalian extinction due to anthropogenic climate change, \" the researchers say — though they hope the animals reached the island on debris from papua new guinea and still survive there. Researchers say extreme weather was a factor in the extinction of the little swan island hutia, a rodent once found on an atoll off honduras, but cats were also to blame. \" if this is one of the first \" extinctions solely linked to humans, \" it is more than likely not going to be the last, \" says an ecologist. \" species restricted to small, low lying islands, or those with very tight environmental requirements are likely to be the first to go. \" ( five islands have already vanished. )",

Anderwald's sister, tedra hunt, was walking to the house as allison pulled her mother to the shallow end, and footage shows the girl running for help as soon as her mother's face was out of the water. \" the doctors explained to us that had tracy been underwater any longer, she probably wouldn't be with us right now, \" hunt, 32, tells abc news. \" it is truly amazing that this little girl, who's actually also pretty small for her age, was able to save my sister. \" hunt says their father, who died two years ago, was a \" guardian angel; \" anderwald, 34, will undergo neurological tests to figure out what caused the seizure, which she'd never had before. The sisters are sharing their story in the hopes of demonstrating the importance of teaching children to swim. Allison, their \" little mermaid \" and \" little hero, \" has been swimming since she was a toddler. ( this skilled dartmouth swimmer drowned. )",

Per the new york times, witnesses told local media that former massachusetts sen. Scott brown acted \" obnoxiously \" at a july peace corps event in apia. Brown confirmed wednesday to new zealand's stuff that there had indeed been an \" administrative inquiry \" by the us state department into his behavior and that he'd been warned to be more \" culturally aware. \" the guardian reports the complaints apparently came from two female peace corps members. The remarks revolve around him telling guests at the event they looked \" beautiful, \" as well as noting to a waitress she could make \" hundreds of dollars \" if she were a waitress in america. But while brown says he did compliment guests on their appearance, he says he'd seen them before the event looking \" dirty and grungy \" and that they'd cleaned up so nice he felt compelled to compliment them. He also says he made comments about both women and men, and that his wife, gail huff, made similar remarks. As for the waitress, he says he was simply noting she was doing a \" great job, \" per the times. Why he thinks the complaints against him are politically motivated: he's a trump supporter said to have the president's ear. \" at this event there were a lot of people [ who ] didn't like [ trump ], \" he told stuff. \" sadly, it's politics, and it is what it is. \" he did note, however, he ' ll try to be more culturally sensitive in the future.

The defense attorneys argued, among other things, that mosby had influenced the jury pool by \" [ adopting ] and [ encouraging ] the public's cry of ' no justice, no peace ' \" when she publicly announced the charges against the officers in may. Another complaint by the defense: mosby's judgment was influenced by her husband serving as councilman for a local district that saw a \" disproportionate amount of violence \" in the days after gray's death, the ap reports. Williams called that assertion \" condescending \" and said while he was \" troubled \" by some of mosby's comments during her may 1 news conference, the defendants ' right to a fair trial wasn't compromised by her statements, per the ap. The hearing is expected to continue this afternoon to determine whether the trial for the six officers should be split up.

        "summary": "Us consumers throw out or otherwise waste 1.3 billion pounds of edible seafood every year — that's more than a quarter of the country's annual supply, according to a press release from john hopkins center for a livable future. Those numbers come from a new study published in global environmental change that found up to 47 % of the us ' edible seafood supply goes uneaten every year. Some of that is the fault of fishermen catching the wrong species or product lost during distribution and retail. But the majority of the waste — 51 % to 63 % — is squarely the fault of consumers. The 2.3 billion pounds of edible seafood that goes uneaten is enough protein to sustain more than 10 million people for a year. The findings are especially important now, with experts encouraging us residents to eat more seafood in lieu of chicken, beef, or other meats, according to the researchers. Unfortunately, a number of factors — including overfishing and climate change — are destroying the world's seafood supply. \" if we're told to eat significantly more seafood but the supply is severely threatened, it is critical and urgent to reduce waste of seafood, \" the study leader says in the press release. Researchers suggest packaging seafood in smaller portions or encouraging consumers to buy frozen seafood. Time reports the new study fits with the federal government's plan — announced last week — to reduce food waste by 50 % by 2030. \"let's feed people, not landfills, \" the epa said at the time.",

The rising seas prompted evacuations along the eastern english coast, with 1,400 properties flooded and at least a half-dozen communities at great risk of exceptionally high tides and large waves. In london, the thames barrier — a series of huge metal plates that can be raised across the entire river — closed for a second time in as many days to protect the city from the surge. Environment secretary owen paterson said there would be \" exceptionally high tides \" on friday and saturday, though they were not expected to reach thursday's levels, when water swamped seaside promenades and flooded homes. In the town of hemsby in eastern england, several houses fell into the sea as waves eroded cliffs. People walk during snowfalls caused by hurricane-force xaver at old town in gdansk, northern poland. The death toll from xaver sweeping across northern europe rose to eight on friday. ( renata dabrowska/reuters ) britain's environment agency said that sea levels late thursday in some areas exceeded those in a 1953 flood in which hundreds died. But flood defences and evacuation warnings meant that only two people were killed in storm-related accidents. Accidents linked to the storm",

As supervisors considered how to discipline him, he retired two days later, the arizona daily star reports. Ekstrum's refusal caused \"confusion and delay \" during the preparatory process, and one fire engine had to stop along the way to pick up a replacement, but his crew was not one of the initial teams on the scene; they responded in a support, not emergency, fashion. Ekstrum later apologized and explained in a statement that he doesn't have any problem with giffords and even voted for her in the last election, but that he was distraught over the shooting and thus \"distracted to the point of not being able to perform my routine station duties to such an extent that i seriously doubted my ability to focus on an emergency call. \" in lighter giffords news, the star notes that she sang \"american pie \" over the weekend, and knew all the words.",

She said one of her friends, a rabbi in houston, is also visiting with giffords regularly. Giffords, 40, is recovering from a gunshot wound to the head at tirr memorial hermann in houston, where her husband, astronaut mark kelly, lives. She was one of 19 people shot jan. 8 at a northwest-side supermarket as she held a meet-and-greet event. Six people died. \" i sang a prayer with her, \" aaron said. \" she also sang ' american pie ' and she knew all the words. She was singing it with mark and mark's daughters, who noticed that she knew the words better than they did. \" giffords was shot in the left forehead and the bullet went clear through the left side of the brain, which typically controls right-side strength, sensation and speech.

        "summary": "Hopes that a booming chinese economy might give the moribund west a boost have taken a hit with the release of figures showing the country's growth is at its slowest since the financial crisis. The chinese economy has slowed for the sixth quarter in a row, with last quarter's 7.6 % gdp growth rate representing a three-year low. While 7.6 % would sound pretty sweet to most western countries, the figure is just one of many signs that the chinese economy is struggling — export growth in the first half of 2012 is down steeply from a year earlier and the people's bank of china has cut interest rates for the second month in a row in its first reductions since 2008. China is also embroiled in a fierce crackdown on real estate speculation, further reducing demand. Most analysts expect the chinese economy to rebound later this year, although the situation may be worse than official figures show: electricity consumption has slowed much faster than growth in official gdp, leading some to suspect that the figures are being skewed ahead of the once-in-a-decade leadership transition this fall, bloomberg notes. Still, \" china's economy survived a period of much slower growth in 2009, where there were massive layoffs, without social unrest or serious problems, \" an analyst at clsa tells the guardian.",

Investors, bankers and economists face a host of difficulties in interpreting the numbers from china's statistics bureau, bloomberg businessweek reports in its july 16 issue. Combining all officially reported provincial gdp numbers for last year produces a total exceeding national gdp by about 10 percent, ma jiantang, head of the national bureau of statistics, said in february. Ma said that is due partly to double counting of items including factory production and that his bureau was trying to correct the issue. China's registered urban unemployment has moved between just under 4 percent and 4.3 percent for the last decade, while electricity consumption has slowed much faster than growth in official gdp when it normally should move more in tandem.

            "China's growth has slowed to its lowest rate since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009, though analysts voiced optimism on friday that the economy may have bottomed out already. Second-quarter growth of 7.6 % – down from 8.1 % in the previous three months – was in line with expectations, but dampened hopes that the world's second largest economy would help to offset wider woes. \" the growth rate of 7.6 % is already an achievement because the economic situation facing china has been complex and severe, \" said sheng laiyun of the national bureau of statistics. \" we have seen tepid domestic and external demand. \" growth in the first half of the year stood at 7.8 % overall, with europe's struggles and government curbs on the property market weighing on the economy.

            "China's growth has slowed to its lowest rate since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009, though analysts voiced optimism on friday that the economy may have bottomed out already. Second-quarter growth of 7.6 % – down from 8.1 % in the previous three months – was in line with expectations, but dampened hopes that the world's second largest economy would help to offset wider woes. \" the growth rate of 7.6 % is already an achievement because the economic situation facing china has been complex and severe, \" said sheng laiyun of the national bureau of statistics. \" we have seen tepid domestic and external demand. \" growth in the first half of the year stood at 7.8 % overall, with europe's struggles and government curbs on the property market weighing on the economy. The asian development bank trimmed its forecast for the year from 8.5 % to 8.2 % on thursday – echoing the world bank's move in may. The chinese premier, wen jiabao, warned last week that the economy \" still faces relatively huge downward pressure \". Lower than expected consumer inflation and import growth, in addition to producer price deflation, have also unnerved investors.

Plus, turkey is a very american bird, and a large enough one to feed a table full of people, so when abraham lincoln officially made thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863, that's what was on the menu. The pilgrims didn't eat cranberry sauce, either, considering sugar was a luxury at the time and it's kind of an integral ingredient in the sauce.

Calling the site \" hugely valuable, \" roberts tells the guardian the discovery \" is unparalleled in recent years and it gives us a perfect opportunity to understand roman and post-roman britain. \" it's not just the size of the building, believed to be three stories, that indicates it was the home of an important roman: it's the stuff scientists have found along with the house — discarded oyster shells, for instance, which would have been imported from the coast. \" high-status pottery, \" coins, and the mosaic flooring itself all point to wealth.

That's not to say the doctors ' group is calling for a ban, which it says it weighed and decided against due to cases where male circumcision is medically necessary and for the potential for clandestine botched procedures, says moller. Had they wanted a ban, they'd possibly face a steep slope. In a june report to the un, denmark agreed with egypt's stance that it is a parental right to circumcise one's male child, reports the copenhagen post. Still, the local reports that 74 % of respondents to a 2014 survey said they'd support a full or partial ban. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 circumcisions take place in denmark each year, and the country should have a firmer idea of that number as of jan. 1, after which all circumcisions must be logged in denmark's national patient registry, reports the local. Doctors who fail to do so will be fined, reports the post. The cdc reports that in 2010, an estimated 58 % of male newborns were circumcised in the us. ( this mom went into hiding and then to jail in an attempt to avoid circumcising her son. )",

Using data from the national hospital discharge survey ( nhds ), annual rates of newborn circumcision are presented for 1979 – 2010. National and regional rates are shown in both tabular and graphical form, and trends across the 32-year period are discussed. Note that these estimates do not include circumcisions performed outside the hospital setting ( e.g., ritual circumcisions ) or those performed at any age following discharge from the birth hospitalization. Thus, these rates cannot be used as prevalence estimates for all male circumcisions in the united states. National trends across the 32-year period from 1979 through 2010, the national rate of newborn circumcision declined 10 % overall, from 64.5 % to 58.3 % ( table and figure 1 ). During this time, the overall percentage of newborns circumcised during their birth hospitalization was highest in 1981 at 64.9 %, and lowest in 2007 at 55.4 %.

The foreign relations committee chair said that north korea has made several overtures in the last two decades, only to reverse course. In a separate interview with cnbc, retired gen. Michael hayden credited progress with north korea to four things: \" the president squeezing the [ north ] koreans, the economic sanctions, the diplomatic isolation, the military demonstrations. \" he added, though, that trump's earlier tweets about kim, in which he famously called him \"rocket man, \" were not helpful.

On june 4, 1629, the dutch east india ship the batavia was downed by a reef on its maiden voyage. Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby beacon island, off western australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in july of that year was gruesome: the west australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant jeronimus cornelisz: some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the bbc. The batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999. Australia's abc reports that the final day of searching the island during a 2013 expedition surfaced a tooth. Upon returning, archaeologists searched the area where the tooth was uncovered and have now found the island's 11th skeleton — with an archaeologist explaining it's the first to have been found using archaeology, while the others found to date were uncovered \" by accident. \" two musket balls were recovered near the remains, which are believed to be that of a youth. Jeremy green, the wa museum's head of maritime archaeology, says it doesn't appear the remains and the tooth are linked, however, indicating there may be another grave nearby. He frames the importance of uncovering more: \" this was the first time that europeans lived in australia — albeit it wasn't in the mainland but it was here — so it's the oldest known european habitation in australia. \" ( the tragic story behind three partial skeletons was recently revealed, more than 160 years later. )",
