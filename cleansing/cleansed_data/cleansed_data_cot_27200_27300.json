        "summary": "The series finale of mad men aired last night, wrapping up the show's seven seasons on amc. The overwhelming reaction on social media: division. Some loved it, some hated it, but many critics appear to be siding more with the naysayers. What they're saying: mad men may be rob sheffield's \" favorite show ever, \" but \" the finale sucked, \" he admits. Sure, it was \" clever \" and \" heart-tugging, \" but there wasn't a single scene showing sally and don together. What gives? \" the second-to-last episode would have made an even stronger ending — it was one of the show's most passionate and perfect hours, \" he writes at rolling stone. Instead, the makers tacked on \" bonus \" footage \" full of sodden shtick \" that \" looked far more like a 2020 mad men reunion special than an actual episode. \" in fact, it \" was one of the show's least mad men-like episodes ever. \" maureen ryan at the huffington post loved the series, too, but not the finale. \" there were three main character threads to it: joan, peggy, and don. One of them was satisfying, but two of them, for various reasons, ended up being frustrating, \" she writes. \" some past season finales were more satisfying and resonant than the series finale was. \" she adds certain plot points, particularly don not heading home to see betty, \" felt decidedly off. \" so did the way the show wrapped up don and sally's relationship. Sadly, the finale \" was messy in some ways that caused me to grit my teeth. \" as a critic, eric deggans \" was a bit underwhelmed \" by the final seven episodes of the series, which featured \" whole characters and storylines [ that ] seemed unnecessary, \" he writes at npr. But \" as a fan, i was a little heartened by the show's finale. [ creator matthew ] weiner resolved nearly every character's story in a mostly positive fashion that close watchers of the show will likely love. \" at least weiner won't lose any sleep over the reviews. \" i hate to say it: i don't really feel like i owe anybody anything, \" he told the new york times before the episode aired. \" i've been lucky to have them invite us into their home, but we have held up our end of the bargain so far.

He noted that ali's views changed as he matured, but his comments are still getting a lot of blowback: john legend and chrissy teigen jumped into a twitter feud with morgan, us reports. Quite a few people piled on morgan on twitter, leading him to tweet, \" i hope people don't make me sound too perfect when i die.

But top officials tell politico that behind the scenes john boehner and president obama, who had what one insider called a \" short, curt conversation \" last night, have a pretty good idea what the deal will look like, even if there's a whole lot of posturing to be done before it's struck. Here's what we know: politico's insiders expect about $ 1.2 trillion in tax hikes, at least $ 400 billion in entitlement cuts — mostly from medicare — and $ 1.2 trillion in other spending cuts and \" war savings. \" even republicans privately admit taxes will go up on people making more than $ 250,000, because there just aren't enough deductions to cut to bring in $ 1.2 trillion in revenue. But rates might not go all the way up to clinton-era levels. After meeting with obama, erskine bowles tells the wall street journal that the president is flexible about the exact size of the increase, and several democrats have confirmed as much. And when it comes to deductions, anything is on the table, including a fairly sacred cow: the mortgage interest deduction. The washington post reports that the popular $ 100 billion-a-year giveaway is getting a hard look since it mostly benefits wealthier americans. The ceos of 14 major corporations met with president obama yesterday, and emerged sounding supportive of tax hikes, reuters reports.

        "summary": "A law enforcement official is speaking out about the evidence robert durst was presented with before he allegedly confessed to murder while wearing a mic. The unnamed official tells the ap that durst was handed two letters during the final episode of the hbo series the jinx: one he had written in 1999 to his friend susan berman — who was murdered a year later before police could question her about the 1982 disappearance of durst's first wife — that her son found among her things. The second was an anonymous note that \" only the killer could have written \" that told police there was a body in berman's house, the los angeles times reports. Both feature similar penmanship and misspell beverly hills as \" beverley. \" in the episode, durst said he didn't write the letter referring police to a \" cadaver, \" but he couldn't differentiate between the two when handed enlargements of parts of the two pieces of correspondence. How the ap describes his reaction: he \" blinked, burped oddly, pulled his ear, and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer. \" he then went to the bathroom, where the hot-mic moment was captured. The times reports the filmmakers handed over the letter roughly two years ago; it's unclear why police didn't uncover it in the first place. The official says that evidence, which filmmakers gave to investigators, helped authorities charge durst with murder. His alleged bathroom confession wasn't considered by prosecutors; its authenticity is under review. Durst waived his right to fight extradition to california yesterday. It isn't clear when he ' ll leave new orleans.",

        "summary": "Abraham lincoln may have been a world-class orator, but one of his famous letters — known as one of the best english-language letters ever written — was \" almost certainly \" not authored by the former president. According to a press release, lincoln sent a letter to a woman named lydia bixby in november 1864 after bixby lost her sons in the civil war. \"i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming, \" newsweek quotes the letter as saying. \"but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save. \" as the letter gained notoriety for its prose, historians started to debate if it was actually written by lincoln's secretary, john hay. A team of forensic linguistic experts may have finally solved the mystery. With the original letter missing for more than 150 years and both hay and lincoln long dead, the researchers turned to a process called n-gram tracing, in which a computer searches for recurring strings of words, or linguistic forms. Time has an in-depth explainer of how n-gram tracing works, and researchers have published a presentation on their work here. A similar method was used in 2013 when sussing out that author robert galbraith was actually jk rowling. Researchers used n-gram testing on 500 texts by both hay and lincoln, then tested the bixby letter. In 90 % of tests, hay was identified as the author of the letter. The other 10 % were inconclusive, with lincoln never once being identified as the letter's writer. ( a new theory could explain mary todd lincoln's odd behavior. )",

Reducing the number of tax brackets for individuals to three is wise, but they hate the possibility that a fourth might be created for the wealthiest americans. In short, the plan will simplify things and boost us competitiveness — \" if the final product isn't diluted by the class-warfare brigades and k street lobbyists. \" new york times: vital details are scant, but this much is clear about the plan editors call a \" boondoggle \": despite what the president says, this plan could actually leave members of the middle class worse off, and it would \" do little or nothing to improve the lot of the working class. \" so who would benefit? think \" hedge fund managers, corporate executives, real estate developers, and other members of the 1 percent, \" write the editors. \" and can it be just a happy coincidence that mr. Trump and his family would benefit ' bigly ' from this plan? \" usa today: the editors think that simplification is welcome and that the cut in the corporate tax rate is long overdue. But ultimately, they can't support it. \" perhaps the most egregious provision in the gop plan is a longtime goal of some of america's wealthiest individuals, many of whom also happen to be major political donors: an end to the tax on inherited wealth. \" national review: the plan is \" chock-full of good ideas about modernizing the taxation of business, \" write the editors, but the changes in regard to individual tax rates are still too much up in the air to properly gauge. Republicans should be wary of the effect on the deficit, but they \" have an opportunity to pass a reform of the tax code that makes it more pro-growth and pro-family while also simplifying it.

            "Republicans ' framework for tax reform is chock-full of good ideas about modernizing the taxation of business. Its provisions for the individual tax code are more of a work in progress. The corporate tax rate, now higher than those of other advanced countries, would drop to below the average. Non-corporate businesses would see their tax rates drop, too. Businesses of both kinds would have less ability to deduct interest payments and could write off their investments more quickly. Business taxation would be done on a territorial basis — which means, in combination with the other changes, that the u.s. Would be a more attractive location for capital. Over time that ought to mean faster wage growth. Most people will want to know how the reform would affect their own tax bills, and there the framework is harder to read. People now pay 10 percent on their first $ 9,300 in taxable income. That will rise to 12 percent under the plan. The personal and dependent exemptions will disappear, as will the deduction for state-and-local tax payments. In return for those hits, taxpayers will get a larger standard deduction and, if they're in higher brackets, lower rates on a lot of their income. The framework also says the child credit should be expanded \"significantly. \" the net effect will depend on where the brackets are set and how large that child-credit increase is. Senators mike lee and marco rubio say that the child credit has to be doubled: anything much less than that will be a tax increase on a lot of middle-class families. And since we don't know these details, we also don't know the fiscal impact of the plan: how much will it increase the deficit, especially if it does not quickly yield higher economic growth? as they translate the framework into legislation, republicans should both take lee's and rubio's advice and avoid a large increase in the deficit — even if it means scaling back some of their other tax cuts.

The personal and dependent exemptions will disappear, as will the deduction for state-and-local tax payments. In return for those hits, taxpayers will get a larger standard deduction and, if they're in higher brackets, lower rates on a lot of their income. The framework also says the child credit should be expanded \"significantly. \" the net effect will depend on where the brackets are set and how large that child-credit increase is. Senators mike lee and marco rubio say that the child credit has to be doubled: anything much less than that will be a tax increase on a lot of middle-class families. And since we don't know these details, we also don't know the fiscal impact of the plan: how much will it increase the deficit, especially if it does not quickly yield higher economic growth? as they translate the framework into legislation, republicans should both take lee's and rubio's advice and avoid a large increase in the deficit — even if it means scaling back some of their other tax cuts. Republicans have an opportunity to pass a reform of the tax code that makes it more pro-growth and pro-family while also simplifying it. They should take it. Read more: an",

That's not all: ardrey tells the scotsman he's identified all 12 of arthur's battle sites around scotland, including where he died — near falkirk, 12 miles from where his round table has supposedly been found — and the spot he was buried, on the island of iona. \" the legendary arthur is said to be buried in an island in the western seas — avalon — but in the south of britain there are no islands in the western seas, \" ardrey says. \" iona fits all the criteria. It's an island where hundreds of kings were buried. Some say 128.

And, yes, that includes lions and tigers, according to the times. The large cats must be knocked out with a dart gun before receiving their contraception injection. The telegraph reports 11 antelopes at paignton zoo had to be killed last summer after one was found to be infected with tb. The disease is believed to have originated with a badger. Government rules say no animals can be transferred from the zoo until the end of the year at earliest to prevent the spread of tb. That's left the zoo concerned about overcrowding. As part of its breeding program, paignton usually sends animals to hundreds of zoos around the world. Now if it doesn't stop its mammals from breeding, it could run out of space. \" we must prevent overcrowding, but we must still be in a position to take part in breeding programs when the restrictions are lifted, \" says ghislaine sayers, the zoo's head vet. \" so we need temporary solutions. \" there are risks involved with giving animals contraception: it can wear off too quickly and allow them to become pregnant; it can cause young animals to become sterile; and it can cause male animals to lose muscle. \" and animals are individuals, so — like humans — some contraceptives suit some better than others, \" sayers says. The zoo is consulting with experts around europe and will test its animals for tb again in six months. It also plans on improving fencing to keep badgers out. ( the diet of captive gorillas could be killing them. )",

When she responds that kelly \" said that you guys wanted me to leave, \" the president replies, \"no … i, i, nobody even told me about it. \" he adds: \"you know they run a big operation, but i didn't know it. I didn't know that. Goddamn it. I don't love you leaving at all. \" after the tape's release, trump attorney rudy giuliani suggested that manigault newman might be breaking the law. \" she's certainly violating national security regulations, which i think have the force of law, \" he said on fox &amp; friends, per the ap.

        "summary": "Sorority members at the university of virginia are taking a stand over a rule they argue is rooted in discrimination. This saturday is bid night at uva campus fraternities, an event in which the sorority sisters normally take part — but this year, national chapters are requiring many of them to avoid the parties, the washington post reports. The national chapters'decision follows the death of a student as well as allegations of gang rape at a fraternity house. Though those allegations were later said to be unsubstantiated, the university has taken a hard look at safety on campus, the post notes. Now, some women are even banned from participating in events with fraternity members off-campus that night. Says the national panhellenic organization that oversees greek life: \" npc supports the safety of their women, so they do support those national presidents making that decision and encouraging sorority women to plan sisterhood events and other 'safer ' options. \" a letter to the npc gives voice to those opposed to the policy: \" sorority women are being used as leverage to change the actions and behaviors of fraternity men, \" it reads. \" this resolution has misconstrued us as a passive aggregate rather than active agents for change. \" meanwhile, an online petition to revoke the ban has gathered more than 2,000 signatures. The school's student council yesterday passed a resolution calling on the national groups to change the mandate, the cavalier daily reports.",

We are saying painful goodbyes to about 18 % of our zynga brothers and sisters. The impact of these layoffs will be felt across every group in the company. None of us ever expected to face a day like today, especially when so much of our culture has been about growth. But i think we all know this is necessary to move forward. The scale that served us so well in building and delivering the leading social gaming service on the web is now making it hard to successfully lead across mobile and multiplatform, which is where social games are going to be played. These moves, while hard to face today, represent a proactive commitment to our mission of connecting the world through games. Mobile and touch screens are revolutionizing gaming. Our opportunity is to make mobile gaming truly social by offering people new, fun ways to meet, play and connect. By reducing our cost structure today we will offer our teams the runway they need to take risks and",

It will also include the closing of its offices in new york, los angeles and dallas, as well as other infrastructure costs, adding to the total expense reduction. Zynga continues to have big offices in san francisco; beijing, china; and bangalore, india, as well as several small units across the u.s. ( such as seattle and san diego ).

Sheats shot taylor outside the home, went inside to reload, and returned to shoot her daughter again, witnesses say. Police officers saw the final shot and killed sheats after she refused to drop the gun. The houston chronicle reports that taylor had planned to marry her boyfriend on monday, and may have obtained a marriage license the day she was killed. Maj. Chad norvell of the fort bend county sheriff's office tells cbs news that the husband and wife had been arguing before the shooting. Norvell says jason sheats has been interviewed by police, but they don't want to \" push him too much \" because \" he is in a difficult state right now. \" family friend madison davey tells ktrk that the sisters were \" daddy's girls, \" and the father has told her sheats killed them to make him suffer. \" he told christy, ' just shoot yourself. Make it easy on all of us, just shoot yourself, ' and she said, ' no, that's not what this is about, this is about punishing you, ' \" davey says. \" i always knew something would happen, but i never thought she would do this. Christy was toxic for the family. She was mentally unstable. \"",

Fox is expected to begin talks soon with comcast and tv everywhere to require authentication. But don't panic just yet. A source at hulu tells techcrunch that while hulu has been talking about authentication since 2009, it \" has no interest in being a first mover here, \" so it ' ll probably be years before anything is implemented. Mashable's sources say abc and nbc may soon implement a delay between when a show airs and when it goes on hulu, or authorization-lock their mobile apps, but it's not imminent. Fox already does this, and requires authentication for certain shows. Some of the talks the post referenced appear to simply be expanding which cable providers have access to those shows.",

Keep in mind, this is just a rumor for now, but it's definitely worth keeping an eye on. It's also not clear if this subscription requirement – assuming it is actually going to happen – will just apply to hulu's free service, or if it will also apply to hulu plus subscribers.

Paul dahlen, the national guard spokesman. But he says some of those donations came after the national guard's mission ended in may. The head of the elections council, nicolás gautier, says he's been calling the national guard asking when they planned to distribute the much-needed goods. \" whatever was left after the national guard left was put in those containers, \" says gautier. \" in one of these containers was food for dogs and apparently several of the boxes were broken. After the placement in the van, that brings a lot of rats and it infected everything. \" the find came only a day after puerto rican officials acknowledged 1,427 deaths \" more than normal \" occurred over four months following hurricanes irma and maria, cbs news reports — a far cry from the previous official maria death count of 64, notes the times. Meanwhile, about 300 unidentified bodies await autopsy at a puerto rico morgue, some stored in 18-wheeler trucks outside. \" we were taken to one of the trailers, \" says a cbs reporter. \" the door was open.

Their letter to president andrzej duda asked whether artists did \"obtain permission from the stutthof administrators to make this video, what rules exist for proper conduct at the site, how these are enforced \".

Some related coverage: as isis suffers military setbacks within its self-declared borders, it seems to be shifting toward more guerrilla-type operations. Usa today takes a look. \" these were done by teams of terrorists working with a very thought-through attack plan. I call them ' wolf pack ' attacks. They are rapidly becoming the islamic state's signature. \" that's a former cia official talking to the washington post. Muslims worldwide are struggling to comprehend the wave of violence unleashed during the holy month of ramadan, reports the ap. A tweet by xeni jardin of boing boing questioning how isis could do this during ramadan went viral, and she writes about it in the guardian. Given that hundreds of muslims were murdered in these attacks, a new york times story explores the question of why global outrage seems more muted than after similar assaults in paris or brussels. An isis video says the slaughter of civilians at a cafe in dhaka, bangladesh, is just the beginning unless the country institutes sharia law. See reuters. An unusual fact about the dhaka attackers: they were generally rich and well educated, illustrating the reach of isis, reports the wall street journal.

        "summary": "A loop of blue dental floss is one of ashley volk's treasured possessions, and it's introduced at the start of a new york times article on a moving story of a modern love that overcame great obstacles. The chicago woman first spotted it on the ring finger of samuel siatta's left hand while visiting him at illinois'shawnee correctional center. She had loved him since she was 10. Now, in their mid-20s, he was in the midst of a six-year sentence. The floss, he explained, was a reminder that his time in prison would come to an end in 2022, and that when it did, \" we're going to have a future, and i ' m going to marry you. \" as cj chivers writes, that real future came more quickly than either expected. Siatta had been a rifleman with the marines in afghanistan. As he returned home from war, the ptsd set in and the drinking intensified. One blackout-drunk night in 2014, he busted in the door of a home near where he lived and fought with a former marine who was inside. Siatta can't recall the incident, in which he wielded a pan and ended up stabbed nine times — and then in prison. Then came a december 2016 lengthy nyt magazine article on siatta by chivers that ended up spurring his release ( the piece explains how his conviction ended up being vacated ). More good was to come: justice terrence j. Lavin had also read about siatta; his own nephew had lost his life in afghanistan, and he felt driven to help siatta out. He met with volk and siatta, who spoke of his bad luck: his disability pension had abruptly stopped and he needed a job. Thanks to lavin, by halloween he had both a job and a wife, the judge having married the couple. Read the full story here.",

            "And for society, chambers added, the new arrangement was probably safer. If siatta were to behave well in shawnee, he would be eligible for release in less than three years and would return with virtually no counseling or care for his ptsd. Now siatta would be under state supervision for several years, receiving care throughout. \"the rationale for me became, 'what makes people safer over the long term? ' \" he said. \"is it treatment or just getting him off the street? \" the man who had fought siatta in the house in normal found that his feelings had changed, too. Though he himself did not serve in combat, the marine corps remained central to his life. He served four years as a clerk and was honorably discharged as a noncommissioned officer. G.i. Bill benefits helped underwrite his college studies, and his brother was on active duty. Having been sequestered as a witness during the trial, he did not hear details of siatta's combat tour until january, at sentencing, and as he learned more he came to see siatta as a drunken marine who did something stupid. The home invasion was not personal. \"at the end of the day, it was just a random act, \" he said.

            "And for society, chambers added, the new arrangement was probably safer. If siatta were to behave well in shawnee, he would be eligible for release in less than three years and would return with virtually no counseling or care for his ptsd. Now siatta would be under state supervision for several years, receiving care throughout. \"the rationale for me became, 'what makes people safer over the long term? ' \" he said. \"is it treatment or just getting him off the street? \" the man who had fought siatta in the house in normal found that his feelings had changed, too. Though he himself did not serve in combat, the marine corps remained central to his life. He served four years as a clerk and was honorably discharged as a noncommissioned officer. G.i. Bill benefits helped underwrite his college studies, and his brother was on active duty. Having been sequestered as a witness during the trial, he did not hear details of siatta's combat tour until january, at sentencing, and as he learned more he came to see siatta as a drunken marine who did something stupid. The home invasion was not personal. \"at the end of the day, it was just a random act, \" he said.

A week later, authorities discovered the skeletal remains of two male teenagers who had been missing for months. In both cases, authorities had a ready suspect: ms-13, a gang connected to los angeles and el salvador, the new york times reports. The group is prominent in brentwood, where 68 % of the population identifies as latino or hispanic and more than 17,000 residents are salvadoran. While residents say the gang has caused trouble and fought with rivals in the past, the violence has recently turned toward schoolchildren. According to the ap, all four victims attended the same high school. School officials say gang violence rarely manifests inside the school itself, but administrators admit that they know of several students who may be affiliated. But they also say they cannot ban students suspected of being in gangs from attending school. \" that's state and federal law that they are entitled to an education, \" the principal of one of brentwood's two public high schools says.

        "summary": "After a 10-year legal fight over her mother's will, heather ilott lost this week. The uk woman became estranged from her mother in 1978 when ilott, at 17, went to live with her boyfriend, who ultimately became her husband. In 2002, ilott's mother, melita jackson, made her last will, specifically noting that ilott had been disinherited and instructing executors to fight any claim ilott might attempt to make on the estate. Jackson died in 2004, leaving the majority of her $ 600,000 estate to animal charities. In 2007, ilott challenged the will under the inheritance act, which allows a child to sue if a parent's will does not reasonably provide for their maintenance, per the evening standard. She argued she had been \" unreasonably \" excluded and that she, now a mother of five herself, was living on state benefits because she had no pension. A district judge awarded her about $ 60,000 of the estate. Quite a bit of back-and-forth followed, per the bbc: ilott then tried to get more of the money, leading a high court judge to reverse the district judge's decision, awarding ilott nothing. In 2011, the court of appeal ruled she should get some of the money, but in 2014, again battling to get more of the money, the high court denied her. The following year, however, she won a challenge at the court of appeal, which heard testimony that she couldn't even afford clothes for her children, and was awarded about $ 200,000. But three of the animal charities that were named in jackson's will then challenged that increase, and now the supreme court has ruled in their favor. It's the first time a suit under the inheritance act has made it to the highest court, the telegraph reports. Ilott will still get the original $ 60,000 she was awarded.

Harvey weinstein hosted a fundraiser for obama in new york in march, while michelle obama was feted at a robert de niro-hosted dinner. The president has flaunted some of his celebrity connections, as well, including giving aziz ansari a shoutout in a speech that has since become a staple of late night conversation. Clooney, who has been vocal about his continued support for obama, recently gave the campaign a bit of publicity advice -- he does know something about public relations, after all -- when he told the president to run on his accomplishments. \" the democrats are just very poor, in general, at explaining what it is, when they accomplished something, i think they're pretty bad at it, and republicans are very good at it, \" clooney told meet the press host david gregory. \" if i was a republican, and obama was a republican, i would be selling all of the, you know, he saved the auto industry and he got osama bin laden.

            "Win mcnamee / getty images file president obama hosted george clooney for dinner, and now clooney is returning the favor. The oscar-winning actor and longtime democratic activist will host a 150 seat, $ 40,000-a-plate fundraising dinner in honor of the president's re-election campaign at his home. The event will be co-hosted by dreamworks ceo jeffrey katzenberg; the exec was slated to host the party, but his $ 35 million new home was not finished in time, which led to the search for a new location. Clooney sat just a few seats away from the president at the recent white house state dinner in honor of british prime minister david cameron and has attended two other major hollywood fundraisers for obama in los angeles already this year. The news of the upcoming fundraiser was first reported by entertainment tonight. Clooney will also attend the white house press correspondents dinner as a guest of time magazine. Photos: 10 hollywood players that will make a difference in the 2012 elections obama's campaign has made a concerted effort to woo major hollywood donors after a dip in support as compared to the industry's enthusiasm for his 2008 run. Harvey weinstein hosted a fundraiser for obama in new york in march, while michelle obama was feted at a robert de niro-hosted dinner. The president has flaunted some of his celebrity connections, as well, including giving aziz ansari a shoutout in a speech that has since become a staple of late night conversation. Clooney, who has been vocal about his continued support for obama, recently gave the campaign a bit of publicity advice -- he does know something about public relations, after all -- when he told the president to run on his accomplishments. \" the democrats are just very poor, in general, at explaining what it is, when they accomplished something, i think they're pretty bad at it, and republicans are very good at it, \" clooney told meet the press host david gregory. \" if i was a republican, and obama was a republican, i would be selling all of the, you know, he saved the auto industry and he got osama bin laden. He passed a health care bill that no one could pass -- if that was a republican issue. I would be able to sell his presidency as a very successful one.

The lawsuit, which can be seen here, says the magazine deliberately sought out a \" sensational and graphic rape narrative \" and its discredited story about the alleged gang rape of \" jackie \" by frat members \" subjected the student members and their families to danger and immense stress while jeopardizing the future existence of the chapter, \" the washington post reports. The lawsuit calls the story \" a textbook example of publication with actual malice \" and seeks damages for the \" wanton destruction caused to phi kappa psi by rolling stone's intentional, reckless, and unethical behavior. \" rolling stone retracted the article after a columbia university graduate school of journalism review found that it had failed to meet basic journalistic standards. \" the story was simply too tempting, too sensational, to let facts get in the way, \" the lawsuit charges. The hollywood reporter notes that the article's author, sabrina rubin erdely, is named as a co-defendant in the frat's lawsuit, which seeks $ 350,000 in punitive damages from each defendant on top of the $ 25 million. In the suit, the frat says it has struggled to attract new members and that many potential recruits who attended rush events this year had \" no intention of pledging, but who rather were attending rush out of a curiosity to walk into the ' rape house, ' \" the post notes.

In the only other instance when a us administration determined that a genocide was being committed during an ongoing conflict — in darfur in 2004 — lawyers found that the 1948 un convention against genocide did not compel nations to prevent genocide unless it was occurring in their own country.

Treasurys maturing across the spectrum, from five to 30 years, dropped to new lows as a flare-up of the european debt crisis and worries about global economic growth drove investors toward the safety of u.s. Debt. As prices rise, bond yields fall. The yield on the 30-year treasury note fell the furthest, etching a new low of 2.479 % early monday, according to tradeweb data, before rising to yield 2.517 % in late afternoon trading. Stocks tumbled and the yield on 10-year treasurys hit all-time lows, as fears intensified that spain could need a bailout and aid for greece might dry up. Jonathan cheng has details on the news hub.

On tuesday, as dozens of law enforcement personnel searched farmland belonging to dinardo's parents, weintraub said it was important to \" hang onto hope \" that the men would be found alive. \" we have not recovered any human remains to this point, \" he told reporters. \" but we continue to work very, very hard. \" police say foul play is suspected in the disappearances of jimi tar patrick, 19; dean finocchiaro, 18; mark sturgis, 22; and tom meo, 21. According to sturgis ' father, meo's car was found at a dinardo family property. Dinardo's arrest came two weeks after prosecutors asked police to arrest him on the weapons charge, which had previously been dismissed, reports the new york times. He was found in february with a shotgun he wasn't allowed to possess because he had previously been committed to a mental institution. Weintraub says the charge is unrelated to the disappearances. Dinardo was released late tuesday after his father paid $ 100,000 of his $ 1 million bond in cash, the morning call reports.",

        "summary": "A sumatran rhino, whose discovery in the wild last month was \" hailed as a landmark conservation success, \" has died only weeks later, afp reports. According to national geographic, the rhino, named najaq, was captured march 12 in indonesian borneo in a trap set by conservationists hoping to move any surviving rhinos to a nearby sanctuary. With only 100 or so left in the wild, sumatran rhinos are thought to be one of the rarest mammals on earth. The area where najaq was caught is considered to be unsafe due to its proximity to mining operations and plantations. The female rhino, believed to be 4 or 5 years old, was in failing health and eventually died from a leg infection, which appears to have been caused by an earlier poaching attempt. The capturing of najaq was seen as a big deal because it was the first contact conservationists had with a sumatran rhino in indonesian borneo in 40 years. Until 2013, when hidden cameras captured images of the rare rhinos, they were assumed to be extinct on the indonesian portion of the island. They were declared extinct in malaysian borneo last year, fox news reports. In addition to plantations and mining, sumatran rhinos are at risk from poaching. Their horns are believed to be good for health, despite scientific research to the contrary. While conservationists are disappointed to lose najaq, her death won't be in vain. She proved sumatran rhinos still exist on borneo and need help to survive. \" we will continue protecting them, \" afp quotes an indonesian official.",

It includes him butting heads with executives, accusations of sexual harassment, a wave of employees leaving for personal reasons, and the death of his mother in a boating accident. Meanwhile, cbs news reports investors forced kalanick out because they want to guarantee uber has a successful ipo. \" given its investment in technology and growth, uber can't afford to alienate potential and current customers with adolescent behavior, \" cbs states. While kalanick is out as ceo, he still maintains a large stake in uber and has a spot on the board. Management experts tell the washington post he could have a hard time letting go of his former position. \"this is not a guy who's going to go softly into the night, \" the author of a book on the psychology of ceos says.

Genetic defects, penile cancer surgery, trauma, and even erectile dysfunction are all reasons a sizable number of men might opt for a bioengineered penis. A team of researchers has done it successfully with lab rabbits, reports the wake forest school of medicine, and they've spent the past six years scaling up so that a human patient might soon have a penis made from his own cells biopsied from salvageable tissue and then grown in culture and ultimately transplanted, reports the guardian. If it sounds easy, well, it's not: the penis is a pretty intricate organ. At the bottom of the order of architectural complexity are flat structures ( think skin ); next up, cylindrical structures ( e.g., vagina ); then hollow, non-tubular ones ( bladder ); and finally solid, dense organs, of which the penis is wholeheartedly both. Then add the fact that it includes spongy erectile tissue, and that erections involve the dilating of blood vessels that fill tissue and the stiffening and lengthening of the entire organ. But in spite of the seemingly insurmountable hurdles, the researchers, who hope to be within five years of the first clinical trials, say their bioengineered penis is far superior to the two main options today: a penis constructed from muscle in one's thigh or forearm using either malleable rods where the penis is always semi-erect or inflatable rods with a pump in the scrotum.

        "summary": "The west african country of mali claims four unesco world heritage sites, and as of wednesday, three of them were on the list of world heritage in danger — which runs only 54 items long. The old towns of djenné and its 2,000 mud houses, which have been inhabited since the third century bc and a world heritage site since 1988, joined the list due to \" insecurity \" in the region, according to a press release. Islamist militant groups have plagued mali, time reports, and there were political clashes in the north as recently as this week. Reuters reports troops fired at protesters in the city of gao, whose tomb of askia is also an endangered world heritage site ( as is the ancient malian city of timbuktu ). In djenné, unesco says, \" this situation is preventing safeguarding measures from addressing issues, \" with pravda reporting the flow of building materials used to combat deterioration and erosion has been hampered. The area once served as an \" important link \" in the gold trade, unesco notes. Later, in the 15th and 16th centuries, it operated as a center for the spread of islam. A testament to that is the great mosque of djenné. A comparatively new structure — built in 1907 at the site that formerly held a mosque built around the 13th century, the new york times reported in 2012 — it is the largest mud brick building in the world, according to time. The times noted that mali's persistent dry spells, interrupted by huge downpours, exacerbate fissures in the mud-brick architecture, and the plastering that repairs it accumulates into layers that can weaken it.",

        "summary": "With antibiotic resistance building, experts fear a day when everyday bacterial infections could once again be life-threatening — and a new federal study shows \" we're getting closer and closer to the cliff, \" says a cdc rep. Already, two million people each year suffer from antibiotic-resistant infections, and 23,000 of them die, the study suggests. And that could just be the best-case scenario, based on very conservative estimates that count only deaths directly tied to such infections, the new york times reports. \" this is a floor, \" says a top cdc official. \" we wanted the cleanest number, the least subjective number. \" the times and reuters note the report specifies 17 drug-resistant bacteria and one fungus, including antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea; c. Difficile, which causes potentially fatal diarrhea; and cre, which is now resistant to almost every single antibiotic. The study is the first of its kind conducted by the federal government, and the accompanying report warns against the overuse of antibiotics, both in people and farm animals. As ezra klein points out at the washington post, \" it is very hard to imagine that north dakota and louisiana need to be prescribing antibiotics at twice the rate of california and colorado \" — but that's the case. And here's the \" really scary part \": new antibiotics are being developed far more slowly than just a few decades ago, he notes. The cdc director echoes that: \" we don't have new drugs about to come out of the pipeline. If and when we get new drugs, unless we do a better job of protecting them, we ' ll lose those, also. \"",

            "Chicago antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea, a diarrhea-causing superbug and a class of fast-growing killer bacteria dubbed a \" nightmare \" were classified as urgent public-health threats in the united states on monday. According to a new report by the u.s. Centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ), at least 2 million people in the united states develop serious bacterial infections that are resistant to one or more types of antibiotics each year, and at least 23,000 die from the infections. \" for organism after organism, we're seeing this steady increase in resistance rates, \" dr thomas frieden, director of the cdc, said in a telephone interview. \" we don't have new drugs about to come out of the pipeline. If and when we get new drugs, unless we do a better job of protecting them, we ' ll lose those, also. \" overprescribing of antibiotics is a chief cause of antibiotic resistance, affording pathogens the opportunity to outwit the drugs used to treat them. Only a handful of new antibiotics have been developed and brought to market in the past few decades, and only a few companies are working on drugs to replace them. In addition to resistant gonorrhea, the others now seen as urgent threats, according to the first-of-its-kind report released on monday, are c. Difficile and the killer class known as carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, or cre. The report was conceived to bring together as much information as possible about drug-resistant superbugs and how to slow their spread, with a hope of preserving the remaining drugs that still work, frieden said. The united states is not alone in raising the alarm over antibiotic drug resistance. Last march the chief medical officer for england said antibiotic resistance poses a \" catastrophic health threat \". That followed a report last year from the world health organization that found a \" superbug \" strain of gonorrhea had spread to several european countries.

            "Chicago antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea, a diarrhea-causing superbug and a class of fast-growing killer bacteria dubbed a \" nightmare \" were classified as urgent public-health threats in the united states on monday. According to a new report by the u.s. Centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ), at least 2 million people in the united states develop serious bacterial infections that are resistant to one or more types of antibiotics each year, and at least 23,000 die from the infections. \" for organism after organism, we're seeing this steady increase in resistance rates, \" dr thomas frieden, director of the cdc, said in a telephone interview. \" we don't have new drugs about to come out of the pipeline. If and when we get new drugs, unless we do a better job of protecting them, we ' ll lose those, also. \" overprescribing of antibiotics is a chief cause of antibiotic resistance, affording pathogens the opportunity to outwit the drugs used to treat them. Only a handful of new antibiotics have been developed and brought to market in the past few decades, and only a few companies are working on drugs to replace them. In addition to resistant gonorrhea, the others now seen as urgent threats, according to the first-of-its-kind report released on monday, are c. Difficile and the killer class known as carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, or cre. The report was conceived to bring together as much information as possible about drug-resistant superbugs and how to slow their spread, with a hope of preserving the remaining drugs that still work, frieden said. The united states is not alone in raising the alarm over antibiotic drug resistance. Last march the chief medical officer for england said antibiotic resistance poses a \" catastrophic health threat \". That followed a report last year from the world health organization that found a \" superbug \" strain of gonorrhea had spread to several european countries. The cdc report ranks the threat of drug-resistant superbugs into three categories - urgent, severe and concerning - based on factors such as their health and economic impacts, the total number of cases, the ease with which they are transmitted and the availability of effective antibiotics. Among the top three threats deemed \" urgent \" is cre, which frieden last march called a \" nightmare bacteria \" because even the strongest antibiotics are not effective against it.

        "summary": "Gop rep. Jason chaffetz, head of the house oversight committee, will not run for reelection in utah in 2018, politico reports. Chaffetz made the announcement on facebook wednesday morning, noting that after \" long consultation with my family and prayerful consideration, \" he'd decided to follow his own advice of \" get in, serve, and get out. \" he stressed in his post that he had \" no ulterior motives, \" that he thinks he would've been reelected by \" large margins, \" and that he didn't rule out running for public office in the future — just not next year. The 50-year-old added he's not sick and that he still had the \" full support \" of speaker paul ryan in heading up the oversight committee. The hill notes that chaffetz was instrumental in republican efforts to go after hillary clinton for the 2012 benghazi attack and her use of a private email server. Right before the election, chaffetz even warned if clinton won, the gop had \" two years ' worth of material already lined up \" to investigate her. Chaffetz, who could've kept on as the committee chair until 2020 if he'd been reelected in 2018, has faced criticism of late for seeming \" disinclined \" to investigate fellow gopers ( especially ex-national security adviser mike flynn ) and telling uninsured citizens they should stop using their money to buy iphones so they can buy health care instead, the new york times notes. He also told infuriated attendees at a february town hall in utah that the way they treated him was \" bullying and an attempt at intimidation, \" per the deseret news. Although chaffetz's utah seat is widely thought to be safe in republican territory, the salt lake tribune notes democrat challenger kathryn allen raised nearly $ 400,000 more than him in the first quarter of 2017.",

            "On capitol hill, mr. Chaffetz has shown an opportunistic streak, often rushing toward television cameras with an eager smile. During the election, he vacillated several times before backing president trump. He said he would not be able to look his teenage daughter in the eye should he vote for mr. Trump after revelations arose that mr. Trump had boasted in 2005 of sexually assaulting women. Then he voted for him. And he vowed to investigate hillary clinton whether she won or not. With a ready foil in mrs. Clinton, whose brushes with controversy have sustained many republican congressional careers, mr. Chaffetz appeared primed to emerge as a chief tormentor for a new democratic white house",

Boasting of 15,194 donors, allen said she got at least one contribution from a resident in every state ( as well as some foreign funds, which, according to campaign finance law, had to be returned ).

The boys could only talk in grunts; they weren't toilet-trained, and feces were strewn throughout their apartment home. The boys were saved from the apartment late last month, the ap notes, though child protection officials knew about the family for more than a year, the denver post reports. A family lawyer working near the home says he called child abuse services twice — once in 2012, and once this year — regarding his concerns, but the calls weren't investigated. Even before that, both parents had pleaded guilty to child abuse in both 2006 and 2009. Finally, doctors'suspicions were aroused on sept. 29 when bailey brought one child in to have a cut treated; the injury, as well as the child's condition, raised red flags, 7 news notes. Now, the state child protection ombudsman is investigating the delayed rescue, the post reports. There's still, however, a chance for the kids to recover to a degree — though it ' ll be a tough path, an expert tells the ap: \" they need good therapists and good caregivers, \" she says, but, \" people change beyond my wildest imaginings sometimes. \"",

A spokeswoman for the theater says it was an \" isolated incident that was dealt with rapidly by cinema staff \" and that no one attacked anyone with any kind of glassware. A local man who apparently saw the three women being hauled off to the police station observed that one of the women was in handcuffs, and \" looked the worse for wear with drink. \" meanwhile, the raunchy flick earned a healthy $ 81.7 million in the us and $ 158.3 million internationally over the four-day valentine's day weekend, the ap reports — despite receiving such lethargic reviews.",

        "summary": "It seems millennials are waging a new generational war — and the enemy is cap ' n crunch. The washington post reports the sale of breakfast cereals in the us is down nearly 30 % over the past 15 years. Part of that is growing preferences for things like smoothies and protein bars, according to the new york times. But nearly 40 % of millennials in a recent survey said eating cereal was \" inconvenient... Because they had to clean up after eating it. \" and the fact that young people aren't eating cereal because \" bowls don't clean themselves \" should worry both cereal companies and \" anyone who has a stake in this country's future, \" according to the post. \" is a generational shift in how families raise their kids turning even the most mundane of responsibilities, like doing the dishes, into unthinkable nuisances? \" the post asks, pointing to a 2014 study that found only 28 % of parents make their kids do chores. But while the american work ethic may be doomed, cereal companies are predicting brighter days ahead, perhaps by cashing in on the eccentric ways millennials are eating cereal. \"they have to embrace that people love the flavor and texture of cereal and the vintage nature, but it's not about breakfast, \" a pastry chef who turns cereal milk into ice cream tells the times. For example, a bar in new york sells a $ 16 cocktail infused with fruity pebbles, while a san francisco chef puts bacon-infused soy milk and a fried egg on top of corn pops. More likely, cereal companies will continue their trend toward healthy and organic — such as kellogg's new special k with quinoa — while marketing their products as a portable snack to the younger generation.",

        "summary": "Pity poor twitter. After recently raising $ 200 million on a $ 3.7 billion valuation, it doesn't want to cough up a city payroll tax. So the company is on its way to winning a major tax break from struggling san francisco after threatening to leave its city digs for the ' burbs. The exemption on the tax — which levies a 1.5 % charge on worker compensation — is about to be granted for new employees hired in the next six years at larger companies in a specific downtown area. It's clearly aimed at twitter, which could hire as many as 2,000 workers in that time, saving the company an estimated $ 22 million. Twitter had hoped for a total exemption on all workers, not just newbies, for eight years. Supporters say the move, which will likely be finalized next week, is an incentive to keep firms in a city running out of money and slashing services. \" the bottom line is, if we don't do this we will not have their payroll to tax. Companies will leave, \" a city supervisor tells the san francisco chronicle. Critics characterize it as corporate welfare and a form of extortion. \" if we're going to allow a company to threaten to leave, and give them a tax break so they don't, we're setting a really bad precedent, \" said another supervisor. \" part of social responsibility is paying taxes. \" the real rub is in twitter's marketing itself as a good-guy business, notes gawker. \" young companies like ours are well positioned to build altruism into the corporate culture from an early stage, \" twitter co-founder biz stone boasted last year.",

While the tax incentive would be available to any company, the focus now is on twitter, the high-profile social-networking company that threatened to pack up its south of market headquarters and move to the peninsula, where there is no payroll tax.

Sources said the san francisco microblogging service is also adding two new board members: flipboard's mike mccue and david rosenblatt, who ran doubleclick until a bit after it sold to google.

We used heritrix ( 3.1.1-snapshot ) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives. The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites. However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed urls to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the urls for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl ( and therefore we never got to them ). We also included repeated crawls of some argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed.

The \" burlesque \" star, 30, who has sung the national anthem at many previous sporting events, including game 7 of last year's nba finals, bungled the lyrics, causing confusion amongst the crowd and with viewers at home. \" what so proudly we watched at the twilight's last reaming, \" she belted about one minute into the song, to the bewilderment of somber super bowl fans. What should have come next: \" o ' er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming. \" the five-time grammy award winner held the final note - \" brave \" - for just over six seconds in her trademark guttaral growl, but even that wasn't enough to save her rough start.

Hanson, who pitched four seasons for the atlanta braves and ended his major league stint with the los angeles angels in 2013, started having breathing troubles on sunday and fell into a coma at atlanta's piedmont hospital on monday after suffering \" catastrophic organ failure, \" multiple sources tell wsb-tv. The 6-foot-6-inch 220-pounder, who was 49-35 with a 3.80 era over his career, had been scooped up by the braves in the 22nd round of the 2005 draft and was eyed as a future star, espn notes. He went on to place third in votes in the national league's 2009 rookie of the year contest, per usa today. But things went downhill from there. Hanson suffered injuries over the next few years, including his shoulder and a concussion, wsb notes. And the death of his stepbrother in 2013 sent him reeling: he took two separate breaks from the angels to mourn, usa today reports. \" i was having mental issues with the death of my younger brother, \" he said at the time. \" i didn't know how to handle it. \" he became a free agent later that year and tried to come back, first with the texas rangers ( he was released after one month ), then in the minors with the chicago white sox and the san francisco giants. The baseball world is filled with \" shock and sadness, \" per mlb.com, especially his old braves teammates. A team rep tells the site that some of hanson's ex-colleagues were near him when he died, and the braves tweeted a goodbye to him early tuesday that simply said, \" rip, tommy. \"",

Four men, including her ex-boyfriend, are being questioned for their role in posting it online, reports the bbc. The woman, tiziana cantone, made the private tape with her ex, and she sent it to him and the other men about a year ago for unknown reasons ( the local suggests it was to make her ex jealous ). They allegedly posted it online, where it has since been viewed more than a million times. In the video, cantone is heard saying, \"mi stai facendo il video? bravo, \" which translates to, \" you're filming? bravo, \" a phrase that has been plastered on t-shirts and other items as a running national joke. Cantone tried desperately to have the video taken down, even winning a \" right to be forgotten \" legal ruling to that end in 2015, but the video was so widespread at that point, the victory didn't much matter. She even had to pay about $ 22,500 in court costs, which has been depicted as a \" final insult \" by local media, per the independent. Eventually, cantone quit her job, moved to tuscany, and began the legal process of changing her name. She killed herself this week at her aunt's home near naples, the story generating so much attention that her funeral procession was broadcast on tv. \" now we call for the justice system to act so that her death was not in vain, \" says her family.
