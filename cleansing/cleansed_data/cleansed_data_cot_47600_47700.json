        "summary": "The fate of flight 8501 now appears to be a tragedy, not a mystery: indonesian officials say search-and-rescue teams have recovered debris and bodies from the sea around 10 miles from where the airasia jet was last heard from on sunday, in a spot roughly 100 miles from land. The indonesian navy says bodies have been removed from the sea, and that rescuers are \" very busy now, \" reports the bbc. Workers being lowered on ropes from a hovering helicopter are encountering six-foot waves in their quest to retrieve more bodies. One body, that of a half-naked man whose shirt partially covered his head, was shown on indonesian tv, to wails in a waiting room at the surabaya airport ( more on that here ). Earlier, an indonesian military aircraft spotted debris floating off the coast of borneo, including suitcases and a life jacket, which officials say they have now confirmed came from the airbus a320, the new york times reports. Officials say the bodies were found after a search plane spotted a shadow on the seabed that is believed to be the missing plane, cnn reports. More search teams, divers, and ships with sonar equipment are being sent to the site off the coast of borneo, where the depth of the sea is around 100 feet. \" my heart is filled with sadness for all the families involved in qz 8501, \" airasia founder tony fernandes tweeted. \" on behalf of airasia my condolences to all. Words cannot express how sorry i am. \"",

        "summary": "While north korea keeps up its taunting missile tests, japan is making plans of its own, with north korea seemingly in its sights. The wall street journal reports japan is set to purchase extended-range missiles that could hit the north's military bases. The country's defense ministry says it will ask for $ 19 million in next year's budget to scoop up a norwegian-built joint strike missile that can travel up to 300 miles, as well as extra funds to revamp its f-35 jet fighters to carry lockheed martin missiles, including the company's joint air-to-surface standoff missile. The latter can reach just over 600 miles — far enough to hit land targets in the north from jets near japan. Japan's defense minister minimizes the news, saying japan would keep its reliance on the us for any such strikes. This would mark japan's first-ever purchase of long-range missiles, notes cnn, and the move is upsetting some who want to stick to the official pacifist stance the country has maintained since world war ii. One person likely to be pleased is president trump, who said during a november visit that japan should buy \" massive \" amounts of military equipment from the us. Meanwhile, north korea has reportedly expressed a willingness to have a sit-down with the us over the nuclear detente. The guardian reports that sergey lavrov, russia's foreign minister, informed rex tillerson of that news thursday when the two met in vienna. No response from tillerson yet, but the us state department's stance has been that the north needs to show it's serious about giving up its nukes before a true conversation can be had.",

        "summary": "Another intriguing detail to donald trump jr.'s meeting with a russian lawyer: we already knew that he, natalia veselnitskaya, jared kushner, and paul manafort were in the room. Now comes word that veselnitskaya brought along a russian-born lobbyist described by nbc news as a \" former soviet counterintelligence officer who is suspected by some us officials of having ongoing ties to russian intelligence. \" the lobbyist's name is rinat akhmetshin, and he confirms to the ap that he attended the meeting. Like trump jr. And veselnitskaya, however, he said the meeting didn't yield much of substance. \" i never thought this would be such a big deal to be honest. \" he also denies being a spy. Coverage: his background: akhmetshin was born in russia, emigrated to the us after serving in the soviet military, and reportedly holds dual citizenship. He insists to the washington post that he is not and was never a russian intelligence officer. He says that he served two years in the soviet army as an 18-year-old draftee and that his unit had some unspecified role in intelligence matters. But he says he never trained as a spy. Now a lobbyist: now a washington resident, he is well-known in congressional circles as a pro-kremlin lobbyist, reports the new york times. He has been working with veselnitskaya trying to get the magnitsky act overturned. ( the act, which punishes russians accused of human rights abuses, is bitterly opposed by vladimir putin. ) grassley's letter: now getting a lot of attention is a letter written by sen. Chuck grassley in april to homeland security seeking information about akhmetshin. Grassley said he \" has been accused of acting as an unregistered agent for russian interests and apparently has ties to russian intelligence. \" read it here. Why was he there? akhmetshin said veselnitskaya invited him to attend the meeting at the last minute. This part gets vague: he said she had come across evidence that a us hedge firm seemingly linked to the democratic national committee was violating russian tax laws and sought his advice on how to present the information, per the post. Documents left behind? both the post and the ap suggest that veselnitskaya did indeed leave behind a folder of documents about what she had uncovered regarding allegedly shady funds going to the dnc. Never heard of him: a spokesman for putin says \" we have no knowledge of this person. \" putin similarly has denied knowing veselnitskaya. Hacking accusation: npr notes that in 2015, a mining firm accused akhmetshin of hacking into its computer system. Details on that via courthouse news. All this means what, exactly? everyone will",

And not because of the raw eggs, which can be tied to salmonella poisoning, the huffington post notes. This time the culprit is raw flour, which has been linked to an e. Coli outbreak that's sickened at least 38 people in 20 states since december, usa today reported last month. This particular strain of e. Coli ( o121 ) is a shiga toxin-producing variety that can cause diarrhea, cramping, vomiting, and even death, per the cdc. The fda warning even extends to parents who make homemade play-doh out of flour and water, as well as restaurants, schools, and daycare facilities that offer kids flour-based dough to play with, as the harmful bacteria can still be passed on by someone touching foods made with the flour. General mills voluntarily recalled 10 million pounds of flour sold under the gold medal, signature kitchens, and gold medal wondra names at the end of may ( the fda notes you should throw bags of these brands away ), even though the agency says the danger could lurk in any brand. \" flour is derived from a grain that comes directly from the field and typically is not treated to kill bacteria, \" an fda rep says — meaning bacteria \" from a cow doing its business in the field \" could end up being milled into flour, an indianapolis infection specialist tells the new york times. It's not common to see outbreaks of this sort linked to flour, a food safety lawyer told usa today, noting the last time he could remember was a nestle toll house cookie dough recall in 2009. The fda says if you've got to get your cookie dough fix, stick with commercially made ice creams that contain cookie dough chunks, as they're typically made with treated flour and pasteurized eggs.

So furious, in fact, that trump spoke of yanking his nomination of gorsuch and finding someone else for the job, sources say. \" he's probably going to end up being a liberal like the rest of them, \" trump reportedly told paul ryan and mitch mcconnell during a meeting; a source says mcconnell had to talk trump down. Part of what fueled trump's \" explosion \" was that gorsuch didn't seem \" loyal \" and appeared ungrateful for the opportunity of a lifetime position on the supreme court, other sources note. What appears to have soothed trump's nerves: a handwritten letter from gorsuch, dated march 2 and seen by the post, expressing his gratitude. \" your address to congress was magnificent, \" gorsuch wrote. \" and you were so kind to...

            "Kong: skull island is, reportedly, a reboot of the original king kong from 1933. At the same time, it features a ton of dinosaurs and prehistoric creepy-crawlies in a not-so-subtle nod to jurassic park ( 1993 ). The presence of helicopters, napalm, psychedelic rock and two characters named conrad and marlow mean you might equally consider it a remix of apocalypse now ( 1979 ) or its source material, heart of darkness. I also caught trace elements of flight of the phoenix ( 2004 ) and tora! tora! tora! ( 1970 ). The resulting film bears some relation to the menu at my local chinese restaurant, which lists \"soup with sweetcorn, \" \"soup with noodles \" and \"soup with egg drop \" before reaching — with an air of summary exasperation or exhaustion — \"soup with everything. \" that's pretty much what we get here: soup with everything"

As it stands, young — who faced up to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty last week — will serve only five years of deferred probation, meaning he ' ll have no criminal record if he meets all requirements, like spending 45 days in jail and serving 250 hours of community service at a rape crisis center. He will have to register as a sex offender for life, but howard waved typical requirements for rapists, like going to sex offender treatment and staying away from children and pornography. Why? because the victim apparently had previous sex partners and had agreed to sleep with young, even though she said \" no \" and \" stop \" more than once during the rape. Critics say that federal law usually prohibits evidence of the victim's other sexual behavior, and now future rape victims may think twice about stepping forward. The victim herself was outraged: \" it was a slap in the face, \" she told khou. \" i thought i was going to get help. I thought that it would be taken care of, and i wouldn't have to worry about it anymore. \"",

( ap ) — a 73-year-old man is banned from a florida beach after a parent complained that he was handing out business cards that read, \" sugardaddy seeking his sugarbaby. \" while police didn't arrest richard basaraba, volusia county beach safety capt. Tammy marris said he's been told to stay off the beach and walkovers for six months for violating an ordinance that prohibits soliciting on the beach. Basaraba told the daytona beach news-journal he's \" devastated \" by what he considers an overreaction by officials. He said he wasn't trying to entice anyone into doing anything illegal when he handed a business card out to a group of girls on daytona beach on saturday. But the mother of a 16-year-old girl complained to authorities after her daughter told her about the incident. The girl told officials the man handed her 18-year-old friend the business card while they were at the beach. It featured a picture of a younger woman sitting on the lap of an older man wearing a business suit. Printed on the card were an email address and the accompanying text: \" ask me about your monthly allowance. \" basaraba told the newspaper he's been careful not to hand the cards, which he recently ordered, to anyone under 18. A beach patrol report says basaraba told the 16-year-old that she should contact him when she's 18. The ban is a trespass order and marris said someone who violates such an order can be arrested for trespassing. Basaraba wasn't arrested because police didn't see him handing out the business cards. \" i ' m really upset about it, \" basaraba said. \" this really knocked me for a loop. \" he said recently bought a t-shirt that reads \" accepting application 4a sugar baby, \" which has also proved to be a \" conversation starter. \" \" i've had women stop me and say, ' i want to take a picture with you in this shirt.'they want to put them on facebook. \" basaraba was also putting the pictures on facebook, but he says he's now deleted the account. \" anything i've ever posted gets only gets three or four likes, \" he said, adding that he got 78 likes when he posted a photo posing with the woman in a bikini. He said 95 percent of the women \" found it hilarious. \" \" maybe the younger ones didn't as much"

It keeps functioning because of gold's soaring value — even though the printing press has long meant \" unlimited amounts of cash could be created at essentially no cost. \" after the toil of getting it, gold sits in vaults \" doing nothing. \" meanwhile, there's the bitcoin mine in reykjanesbaer, iceland, which is expending energy \" to create virtual objects with no clear use, \" krugman writes. \" gold, after all, has at least some real uses... But now we're burning up resources to create ' virtual gold'that consists of nothing but strings of digits. \" why the effort for gold and bitcoin? for one thing, there's the unfounded fear of the debasement of government-backed currency. And with bitcoin, there's \" the sense that it's high-tech and algorithmic, so it must be the wave of the future. \" but really, we just miss \" the days when money meant stuff you could jingle in your purse \": we're \" digging our way back to the 17th century. \" click for krugman's full column.

And yesterday he devoted a full column to denigrating the cryptocurrency. He argues that bitcoin mining, the process where new bitcoins are created by repetitive mathematical calculations, is socially wasteful. And, he argues, that's reflective of the pointlessness of bitcoin more generally. There's just one problem: mining isn't just a process by which new bitcoins are created. Those newly created bitcoins are a clever mechanism for rewarding miners for participating in the mining process. The point of the mining process is to process bitcoin transactions. Without it, the bitcoin network wouldn't function at all. By neglecting to mention this fact, krugman misleads readers more than he informs them. Unfortunately, that's par for the course in public discussions of bitcoin. Bitcoin has a dual character as a currency and a payment network. The latter is what makes bitcoin useful and potentially important. Yet the former is what has gotten all the media attention. That's partly because gyrations in bitcoin's value has generated most of the press. It's easy to report that the value of the currency has risen by a factor"

        "summary": "A group of nearly three dozen migrants, most of them kids, paid smugglers to whisk them out of niger and nigeria and to a new life to the north — but instead paid the ultimate price. The five men, nine women, and 20 minors were found dead sunday in the sahara, per niger's ministry of interior, apparently ditched by those they'd hoped would save them and likely victims of extreme thirst, abc news reports. The interior minister said the migrants had perished between june 6 and june 12 near assamaka, per the bbc, with the guardian noting that temps in the desert can soar upward of 105 degrees fahrenheit. What transpired isn't an uncommon consequence: \" thousands of people have lost their lives as a result of the indifferent or even deliberate actions of migrant smugglers, \" the un office on drugs and crime says on its website, noting that as borders have become more tightly policed, migrants have become more wary of trying to cross over on their own. Which often leads to a \" highly profitable \" endeavor for the smugglers, who \" enjoy low risk of detection and punishment, \" and tragedy for the smuggled, who may pay upward of $ 345 each for the chance to escape, per an international organization for migration report. The iom notes that niger is a waypoint for escapees on their way to algeria and libya ( and europe after that ), with migrants usually hailing from nigeria, cameroon, mali, burkina faso, and guinea-bissau. What made this group of doomed deserters unusual: the number of children. Per the iom report, a tracking tool showed that between february and april, the 60,000-plus migrants who passed through niger were overwhelmingly male and between the ages of 18 and 59.

The chinese-made y-8 turboprop aircraft disappeared wednesday afternoon about a half-hour after leaving myeik, also known as mergui, for yangon on a route that would have taken it over the andaman sea, the ap reports. It was raining, but not heavily, at the time. Nine naval ships, five army aircraft, and three helicopters were searching for the plane thursday morning, a military spokesman says. Gen. Myat min oo says the ship found two life jackets, three bodies, and a tire that was part of an aircraft wheel. The bodies were of a man, a woman, and a child. The plane carried 106 passengers — mostly families of military personnel — and 14 crew members. Fifteen of the passengers were children. It is not unusual for such flights to carry civilians to offset transportation costs for military families stationed in the country's remote south. The military says myanmar received the y-8 plane in march of last year, and since then it had logged 809 flying hours. The bbc reports there was no mayday call from the aircraft and while the cause of what is believed to be one of the deadliest plane crashes in myanmar's history is still unclear, the dispersed debris suggests the plane broke up in mid-air.",

Some of those child soldiers were murdered when they tried to run from fighting in anbar province, fox news notes.

As the guardian reports, researchers at king's college london found that they could stimulate stem cells within the teeth to regenerate through a relatively simple approach: they insert a tiny drug-soaked sponge in the cavity. \" the sponge is biodegradable, that's the key thing, \" researcher paul sharpe tells the bbc. \" the space occupied by the sponge becomes full of minerals as the dentine regenerates so you don't have anything in there to fail in the future. \" in their study, the drug used was tideglusib, which has been used in clinical trials as a treatment for dementia and alzheimer's. Having a tooth refill itself naturally is far preferable to the usual treatment of filling the cavity with some kind of amalgam that raises the risk of related problems down the road. \" this simple, rapid natural tooth repair process could thus potentially provide a new approach to clinical tooth restoration, \" write the researchers in scientific reports. Also promising is that because the drug already has been proven safe for clinical trials, the turnaround to real-world applications could happen relatively quickly. One caveat: the study was on mice, and researchers can't say for sure yet whether they'd get the same results in larger, human cavities. ( the main reason people avoid the dentist isn't fear. )",

        "summary": "A kentucky man who was dragged kicking, yelling, and spitting off an american airlines flight last month after allegedly attacking crew members was banned by a us district court judge monday from flying on commercial flights as he awaits trial, the charlotte observer reports. A video shot july 21 by a fellow passenger shows a man ided as michael kerr, 25, trying to disembark the plane that had landed in charlotte, nc, from lexington, arguing with the flight crew and eventually becoming physical, shoving a flight attendant to the ground, per the lexington herald-leader. It's at that point that the pilot can be seen emerging from the cockpit and forcing a seemingly inebriated kerr to the ground, exclaiming, \" you don't put your hands on my flight attendant! \" kerr, who had just reportedly accepted a marriage proposal and downed three whiskey drinks during the morning flight, per the daily beast, was apparently impatient to get off the plane once it landed, ignoring instructions to remain seated. Per an fbi affidavit, he also warned a flight attendant he'd break her jaw and kicked an attendant in the leg before the pilot intervened and held him, with the assistance of the co-pilot and seat restraints, until the police arrived. \" i felt like the flight attendant's life was in danger, \" the man who shot the video tells the herald-leader. Kerr was charged with being intoxicated and disruptive, assault on a female, communicating threats, and interfering with the duties of a flight crew or attendant; the flight attendant he pushed is now in physical therapy for back and neck pain. ( a flight was once grounded because of a mob of irate passengers. )",

He moves slowly, and his hearing and sight are not what they used to be. Over the years, ' 60′s'resident curmudgeon has been criticized frequently for being out of touch with contemporary culture. Rooney could not be reached for comment. Cbs news is expected to confirm the move soon. In a june 2010 interview with tvnewser, rooney said that he intended to work at '60 ' until he \"dropped dead. \" he added: \"until somebody tells me different, i ' m not going to quit. \" no word on who will take over rooney's two-minute slot. Regardless, he's expected to keep his cbs office, where he shows up six days a week, sometimes seven. An accomplished author, rooney will likely concentrate on his writing. Rooney joined cbs in 1949 as a writer for \"arthur godfrey's talent scouts. \" until a few years ago, he wrote his pieces on a manual typewriter from his days as a london correspondent for stars and stripes during world war ii. Longevity at ' 60′ is nothing",

It will be preceded by a segment in which rooney looks back on his career in an interview with morley safer. \" there's nobody like andy and there never will be.

In a facebook post on thursday, zuckerberg explains that chan zuckerberg initiative llc, the entity he's donating 99 % of his facebook shares to, is being set up as a limited liability company instead of a traditional foundation so it can engage in actions like \" funding non-profit organizations, making private investments, and participating in policy debates, \" reports techcrunch, which notes that some critics accused zuckerberg of having ulterior motives or said the move could be \" a big waste. \" the initiative will focus on \" personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities, \" building on previous investments in \" education, science, health, internet access, and inclusion, \" zuckerberg explained. He also addressed concerns that the donation — equivalent to the gdp of serbia, or around $ 38 for every facebook user — could be some kind of tax dodge, explaining that \" we receive no tax benefit from transferring our shares to the chan zuckerberg initiative, but we gain flexibility to execute our mission more effectively \" and that if he wanted to avoid tax, it would have been far more effective to set up a traditional charity, the verge reports.

        "summary": "Teachers and staff of an oregon public school district are disturbed at a district rule requiring them to report any student sexual activity — whether they know about it for a fact or just suspect it, and even if it involves their own children — to law enforcement or state officials. According to the salem-keizer district, the requirement is necessary under the state's mandatory reporting and child abuse laws — all district employees are mandatory reporters and as such are required to report when they have \" reasonable cause \" to suspect a child is being abused — but the statesman journal reports that most other school districts in the state don't consider consensual sexual activity between teens to be something teachers are required to report. More than 1,300 people have signed an online petition asking the school board chairman to put an end to the requirement. The superintendent explains the policy is not new, but the district recently added a training session dealing with situations employees would be required to report. Some of those situations included things like a 15-year-old confiding that she's having sex with her boyfriend and needs birth control, a 14-year-old telling a teacher his parents kicked him out over a same-sex relationship that has turned sexual, or a teacher's own 17-year-old son confessing his 16-year-old girlfriend is pregnant. Employees and students alike say they're concerned that under this requirement, students will lose trusted confidantes at school and will have a harder time getting access to information about safe sex. A district spokesperson tells katu she has been in touch with a legislator about the law's interpretation, and adds to newsweek that the district is \" erring on the side of caution. \"",

Samuel alito, for example, accused opponents of the death penalty of engaging in a \" guerrilla war \" to stop it, while elena kagan likened the execution protocol to being burned alive, reports the washington post. At issue specifically is whether the first drug in a three-drug combination used by oklahoma works well enough — critics say the sedative, midazolam, fails to make the following two drugs painless. Kagan likened the effects of one of those drugs to being \" burned alive from the inside \" and wondered whether the state would sanction burning at the stake after administering an iffy anesthetic, reports nbc news. \" maybe you won't feel it, maybe you will, \" she said. \" we just can't tell. \" antonin scalia, meanwhile, declared that states can't get \" 100 percent \" drugs because death-penalty \" abolitionists \" are making it impossible with their pressure on manufacturers.

But wiping those symbols from america may not be so easy. The latest: the national statuary hall at the us capitol is a surprising stronghold of statues of important confederate figures, with no fewer than eight on display, including jefferson davis and robert e. Lee, reports nbc, which notes that the count doesn't include those who served as confederate soldiers but are better known for their lives after the war. Each state has two historic figures in the collection and replacements are rare, although alabama replaced confederate military officer jabez curry with helen keller in 2009. Alabama, north carolina, south carolina, georgia, virginia, and florida each have one confederate statue in the collection; mississippi has two. A top gop lawmaker in mississippi broke ranks yesterday to call for the confederate emblem's removal from the state flag, the ap reports. \" we must always remember our past, but that does not mean we must let it define us, \" house speaker philip gunn said in a statement. \" as a christian, i believe our state's flag has become a point of offense that needs to be removed. \" so what do americans think? the hill reports on a poll from the left-leaning center for american progress action fund that found 21 % of americans support flying the flag at government buildings.

Mike rogers said on the same program that healthcare.gov's security standards show a \" sheer level of incompetence. \" specifically, he claimed, \" the security of this site and the private information does not meet even the minimal standards of the private sector. \" on abc's this week, former national security adviser tom donilon weighed in on the iran nuclear deal ( \" a very solid achievement \" ) and afghan president hamid karzai's refusal to sign the us-afghan security agreement ( \" reckless \" ). And on cnn's state of the union, howard dean and rick santorum sparred over obamacare. At one point, santorum asked, \" is the president competent to do his job? \" and dean responded that though obamacare is not \" ideal, \" \" i fail to see how it has anything to do with the president's competence.

Beethoven's handwriting is \" unmistakable, \" explains ryan, who is also a composer. His hunch panned out, and what turned out to be a rare 1810 beethoven sketch leaf of beethoven's opus 117, könig stephan, sold at auction in november for $ 120,000, the journal news reports. But before that could happen, the sketch leaf had to be authenticated and the music identified, and ryan is providing new details about the weeks-long process. \"i equate it to trying to find a word in the dictionary without knowing the first letter, \" says ryan, who sought the help of his former music professor, mel comberiati of manhattanville college in purchase, ny. The pair pored over the digital archives of beethoven's works from the beethoven haus in bonn, germany. Most composers threw out their notes, but luckily, \" beethoven didn't throw anything out, \" comberiati told greenwich time. One important clue came in the form of three small holes on the side of the leaf that matched up perfectly with known samples from the complete sketchbook. The sketch leaf sheds light on beethoven's process, showing ideas in pencil getting tweaked and then made permanent with ink, reports abc news. \" it's kind of a mess, \" comberiati tells the journal news. \" he's working out the music.

Researchers took 221 students at the university of british columbia and split them into two groups. For one week, half the students turned their phones to \" do not disturb \" and put them out of reach and out of sight as much as possible while the rest kept using their phones as normal. The groups switched for the next week. \"the results were clear: more frequent phone interruptions made people less attentive and more hyperactive, \" researcher kostadin kushlev writes in quartz. Researchers came to that conclusion by asking participants how often they experienced 18 symptoms — trouble listening, restlessness, careless mistakes, etc. — associated with adhd during the two-week experiment. According to vice, the students — none of whom had been diagnosed with adhd — were more distracted, anxious, and inattentive and more often bored during the week they were using their phones. And while smartphones aren't giving people adhd, the study concludes they are causing adhd-like symptoms. \"these findings should concern us, \" kushlev writes in quartz. \" smartphones could be harming the productivity, relationships, and well-being of millions. \" luckily, there's an easy fix: turn off your notifications and take a break from your phone whenever possible.",

        "summary": "One day after donald trump cemented his hold on the gop nomination, mitt romney has gotten the rumor mills churning with the announcement that he ' ll give a speech thursday morning in utah about the state of the election. At nbc news, andrew rafferty cuts right to the chase with a tweet: \" close ( romney ) aide says he won't endorse or get in, but tomorrow's speech ' will be worth covering. ' \" abc's rick klein had a similar tweet: \" romney is not getting in this race, sources telling us. \" one safer bet is that romney will go after trump, as he has been doing aggressively of late — warning of a \" bombshell \" in his taxes and calling trump's response to white supremacist david duke's praise \" disqualifying. \" the washington post suggests romney's speech will echo one he gave last month in which he said the national electorate was fed up with \" the failure of current political leaders to actually tackle major challenges, or to try at least. \" and given the election year, there's speculation that romney is remaining visible in case something crazy happens at the gop convention, as per this line in coverage at cnn: \" in washington, utah's sen. Orrin hatch told cnn, ' if the convention is locked up, there's a possibility ' romney would run for president. \" at hot air, blogger allahpundit has a similar sentiment: \" this does, however, look an awful lot like romney putting himself back on the radar of #nevertrump conservative voters at the very moment that they're starting to look around for an ' in case of emergency, break glass ' candidate. \"",

The women say they saw williams on the street around 2: 30am sunday and asked him to take a picture with them, but he got upset when they started filming him. He allegedly punched one woman and pointed a gun at the entire group. Police responded, and williams told them the women were actually filming him without his consent and even grabbed a chain from around his neck, which he says is what started the fight; no one was arrested, but the incident is still under investigation. The lawyer also accused williams of stealing the women's cellphones and says police should have done a more thorough investigation. Williams is also suspected of misdemeanor battery in los angeles on tuesday, tmz reports. Police say he got in a fight with onlookers at a car crash and punched somebody; williams says he went to the scene of the accident to help, but the onlookers started making fun of him. When he told them to be quiet, he says, one of them struck him and he was just defending himself when he hit back. Williams had been released from jail in the atlanta case, and was in la tuesday to appear in court for yet another past incident ( perhaps this one? ), tmz reported prior to the car accident incident.",

        "summary": "Despite a vote to oust him, pastor juan mcfarland has refused to leave his church in montgomery, ala.; now, deacons are suing to fire him. Mcfarland admitted he'd had affairs with parishioners on church property — without telling them he has aids, the ap reports. At that point, \" we wanted to get him help, \" says a church official. But he refused, and next he acknowledged drug abuse, finally prompting the deacons ' 80-1 vote to remove him on oct. 5. Instead of leaving, he changed the shiloh missionary baptist church's locks and its bank account number. Yesterday, the deacons announced a lawsuit against him asking a judge to force him out; it points to \" debauchery, sinfulness, hedonism, sexual misconduct, dishonesty, thievery, and rejection of the ten commandments. \" \" i will command the pulpit from this day forward, \" says mcfarland, 47. He hasn't been charged with a crime, though the knowing spread of an std is a misdemeanor in the state. Meanwhile, deacons are concerned for their safety, their lawyer says. A backer of mcfarland, one marc anthony peacock, allegedly said that if the deacons return to the church, they ' ll face \" castle law, \" nbc news reports; peacock denies the claim. But \" most of the membership is scared to go to church right now, \" says the lawyer. \" they don't want someone to shoot them. \" some 50 people attended mcfarland's sunday sermon; normally, about 170 people attend on sundays, says the chairman of the board of deacons.",

The department has decommissioned him ( no uni, no gun, no street jobs ) and launched an internal investigation, but hoffacker's attorney is taking a stand. He says hoffacker wrote the message long after the victim was removed, and was likely stressed out over a weekend of memorial day violence that saw four killed and 15 injured ( hoffacker was lead detective at the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old girl, the times-picayune reports, but no word on whether that's the crime scene in question, notes huffington post ). Andy antippas, owner of barrister's gallery, defended the blood-scrawl as hoffacker's way of coping: \" on at least two occasions, he described crime scenes to me with such pathos, such personal anguish, that i remember distinctly on one of those times tears coming out of his eyes. \" the art hoffacker has shown at barrister's was political satire, though hoffacker says he has no political bent and just makes art to decompress, the times-picayune reports. In a profession that tends to leave people depressed, he says, art \" has helped me be more healthy. \"",

This according to bankrate's june survey, which found that 29 % of 1,000 us adults don't have readily available funds in checking, savings, or money market accounts — the highest percentage since bankrate started keeping tabs on savings five years ago, nbc news notes. The reason is that, while housing prices and stocks have bounced back, household income hasn't grown. \" that makes it very difficult for people to ramp up their savings, \" says greg mcbride, bankrate's chief financial analyst. That doesn't bode well for surprise expenses, which a 2014 american express survey indicates pop up more often than you may think: nearly half of respondents had an unforeseen expense last year, with car trouble, health care, and home fixes topping the list. Part of the savings problem, mcbride says, per marketwatch: \" people don't pay themselves first — they wait until the end of the month to save what's left over and then nothing is left over. \" when those unexpected expenses strike, folks are forced to drive up credit card balances and take out high-interest loans. A financial adviser tells marketwatch that what you don't see can help you and recommends a monthly automatic transfer to a savings account; another adds to keep that account separate from your checking so you're not tempted to take money out of it. The goal to set for your emergency savings, experts suggest: six months ' worth of income — even more if you have kids.

That would eliminate the many benefits the reform has already brought: allowing children under 26 to stay on their parents ' policies; lower drug costs for people on medicare who are heavy users of prescription drugs; free immunizations, mammograms and contraceptives; a ban on lifetime limits on insurance payments. Insurance companies cannot deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions. Starting in 2014, insurers must accept all applicants. Once fully in effect, the new law would start to control health care costs. Mr. Romney has no plan for covering the uninsured beyond his callous assumption that they will use emergency",

        "summary": "Organ donors added 2,270,859 years to the lives of american transplant recipients over 25 years — a \" stellar accomplishment, \" experts say in a study published wednesday in jama surgery. They arrived at the figure after identifying 533,329 patients who received at least one donated organ between sept. 1, 1987, and dec. 31, 2012. They then compared that group to another 579,506 patients who were put on an organ waiting list but didn't receive one to determine the transplants ' effect on lifespan, the los angeles times reports. According to their calculations, people who had kidney transplants lived 1,372,969 extra years, liver recipients lived 465,296 extra years, and heart recipients lived 269,715 extra years. An average of 4.3 years were added to a life per transplant. In terms of specific surgeries, heart transplants gave patients an extra 4.9 years on average, while pancreas recipients averaged 2.6 extra years. The study shows many surgeries, including kidney transplants, are actually \" lifesaving, \" rather than \" life-enhancing, \" experts say. However, as 52 % of those who needed organs went without over those 25 years, \" organ donation must increase \" in order \" to do even more good for humankind in the future, \" researchers say, per medical daily. About 123,000 americans are now waiting for organ transplants. Some of the 102,000 who need kidneys could be helped by living donors, though lost wages and other donor-related costs ( average: $ 5,000 ) can be a deterrent for potential donors, reuters reports.

What she didn't consider was the factor that ultimately disqualified her: personal expenses. The transplant team required an eight-week recovery plan.

            "Commonly asked questions about service animals in places of business 1. Q: what are the laws that apply to my business? a: under the americans with disabilities act ( ada ), privately owned businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants, hotels, retail stores, taxicabs, theaters, concert halls, and sports facilities, are prohibited from discriminating against individuals with disabilities. The ada requires these businesses to allow people with disabilities to bring their service animals onto business premises in whatever areas customers are generally allowed. 2. Q: what is a service animal? a: the ada defines a service animal as any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. If they meet this definition, animals are considered service animals under the ada regardless of whether they have been licensed or certified by a state or local government. Service animals perform some of the functions and tasks that the individual with a disability cannot perform for him or herself. Guide dogs are one type of service animal, used by some individuals who are blind. This is the type of service animal with which most people are familiar.

Mit researchers have created a prototype of a finger-mounted device that uses a camera to scan text, which is then converted to speech in real time. \" for visually impaired users, this is a translation, \" researcher roy shilkrot explains at phys.org. \" it's something that translates whatever the finger is'seeing'to audio. \" a huge challenge, however, was figuring out how to keep visually impaired volunteers ' fingers in line with text. Researchers came up with two options: a device that used vibrating motors on top and beneath the finger to indicate if it needed to move up or down, and another that issued musical tones as clues. While volunteers didn't favor one device over the other, researchers say the motorless option is smaller, lighter, and therefore more ideal. The device uses an algorithm to process what the camera perceives. For now, it relies on an attached laptop, but the next version may use a phone to make it more portable. In an interview last year with techcrunch, shilkrot said the invention should open up a huge number of books to the blind. And perhaps to those who aren't blind but just have trouble reading: shilkrot says parents of kids with dyslexia have already reached out. An engineer is working on a similar device that could help blind people identify distant objects. ( a blind man can see again thanks to a bionic eye. )",

There will also be a single-dose cure for malaria, a vaccine to prevent it spreading to mosquitoes that bite those with the disease, and a diagnostic test to reveal the infected, the gateses predict. The foundation also foresees a rise in digital banking and online education and will push for gender equality. \" we know that when women can participate equally in a country's economy, the gdp goes up 12 %, \" melinda gates tells usa today.

        "summary": "Tarzan loves to fetch sticks, run after snowballs, and is, per julie mcdowall, \" a playful example of global kindness and cooperation. \" writing for the guardian, mcdowall explains that tarzan is one of hundreds of stray dogs living in the 1,000-square-mile exclusion zone surrounding the chernobyl nuclear plant, a native population to the devastated ukrainian area for heartbreaking reasons: they're the descendants of pets abandoned by their owners in pripyat and other neighboring villages in 1986 when the plant melted down, an exodus that left \" dogs howling, trying to get on the buses. … they ran after the buses for ages. \" squads were sent in to shoot the animals left behind, but some of the dogs survived, and now their progeny wander the area as \" chernobyl mascots, \" hanging out near the local cafe and eagerly greeting visitors. Mcdowall concedes it's not the easiest life for the canines, who endure brutal winters and a life expectancy cut short by radiation — she says not many live past the age of 6.

But the fund, which so far has raised more than $ 46,000 to care for the pups, offers the dogs emergency medical care, as well as helps vaccinate and neuter them. \" we want to get the population down to a manageable size so we can feed and provide long-term care for them, \" says one of the fund's co-founders.

Politico and huffpost report the interior secretary attended a gathering of the house natural resources committee and was asked about a commitment to $ 2 million in grants to preserve wwii's japanese-american internment camps; president trump's proposed budget for next year doesn't include that funding. Pressing zinke for a pledge was rep. Colleen hanabusa of hawaii, whose grandfathers were among those detained in the camps during the war. One of her grandfathers, a us citizen kept in oahu's \" hell's valley \" camp, couldn't even talk about his experience there until he was much older. After relaying that background, hanabusa asked zinke: \" will we see [ the grants ] funded again in 2018? \" to which a smiling zinke replied, \" oh, konnichiwa, \" which politico notes is a japanese greeting used midday; the hearing was taking place in the am. After a pause, hanabusa filled zinke in on the correct terminology, answering, \" i think it's still ' ohayo gozaimasu, ' but that's ok. \" hawaii sen.

Yet a new study finds that nearly one in 10 people who've beaten cancer continue to light up — either because their addiction is too strong or perhaps because they don't know enough about treatment plans that could help them quit, researchers theorize. Almost 3,000 cancer survivors who had made it nine years past their original diagnosis were surveyed for the study, published today in the journal cancer epidemiology, biomarkers &amp; prevention. The heaviest smoking rates were found in people who had cancers \" strongly linked to smoking, \" usa today reports: while the smoking rate among cancer survivors overall was 9.3 % — still half that of the general population — people who had fought bladder and lung cancer still puffed away at the more alarming rates of 17.2 % and 14.9 %, respectively. And those survivors who do smoke go big, with 83 % of them plowing through an average of 15 cigarettes daily — and 10 % saying they're not going to quit.

It's also an outlier in a literal sense, sitting 30 miles west of the volcanoes that neatly line the cascade arc from north to south. Now scientists are reporting in the journal nature communications that they've discovered another oddity: the volcano appears to be perched atop what gizmodo calls \" a cool wedge of serpentine rock \" — dramatically unlike the fiery cauldrons of hot magma beneath other volcanoes. \" we don't have a good explanation for why that's the case, \" steve hansen, a geoscientist at the university of new mexico in albuquerque, tells gizmodo. His team drilled a couple dozen holes, filled them with explosives, and triggered minor earthquakes to watch seismic wave activity beneath mount st. Helens, \" a bit like a cat scan, \" hansen says. But their findings leave them with more questions, namely: what's the volcano's heat source, if it's not right below the volcano itself? hansen surmises that it's coming from further east, but until his team does more research, it's what science news is calling \" a cold case. \" ( earlier this year, there were dozens of small quakes on the mountain every week. )",

        "summary": "Competitive eating contests were in full force over the july 4th weekend — chow-down champion joey chestnut even got engaged before one of his recurring food feats. But there was a tragic ending for one participant in a south dakota competition: walter eagle tail choked to death last thursday during a hot-dog-eating contest in custer. Although paramedics tried to save the 47-year-old at the scene after a piece of hot dog apparently lodged in his throat, eagle tail died after being taken to a nearby hospital. \" it all happened within minutes \" custer county's sheriff tells the rapid city journal. The local chamber of commerce director said it was the first time \" in memory \" anyone had been injured at the annual event. It's not, however, the first time someone has died while taking part in such a contest. A 60-year-old died during a sausage-eating contest in romania last year, per the huffington post, and a florida man choked to death in 2012 after devouring dozens of live cockroaches in a bid to win a python. That's exactly why the international federation of competitive eating has strict rules in place during the contests it sponsors ( it appears the custer contest was not one of them ). \" walter was just being walter, having fun when he entered this contest, \" a friend tells the journal, adding that eagle tail enjoyed a good joke and interacting with the customers who purchased the bear-claw necklaces he made and sold.",
