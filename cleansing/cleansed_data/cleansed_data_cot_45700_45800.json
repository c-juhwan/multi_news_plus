        "summary": "Donald trump is deeply unhappy about this fall's presidential debate schedule — and apparently a little confused about who created it. Two of the three debates clash with nfl games, and trump tweeted friday that hillary clinton and the democrats were \" trying to rig the debates, \" though the debates were scheduled by the non-partisan commission that has been organizing presidential debates since 1988, mcclatchy reports. The schedule, which also includes one vice presidential debate, was set in september last year, long before the nfl released this season's schedule. The commission on presidential debates, which consulted with officials in both parties before creating the schedule, says it's impossible to avoid all sporting events and it stands by the schedule, the new york times reports. In an interview with abc's this week, trump accused clinton of rigging the debate schedule to minimize the audience. \" i ' ll tell you what i don't like. It's against two nfl games, \" he said. \" i got a letter from the nfl saying,'this is ridiculous. ' \" an nfl spokesman said they would prefer a different debate schedule but that there was no letter to trump. \" mr. Trump was made aware of the conflicting dates by a source close to the league, \" a trump aide tells cnn. \" it's unfortunate that millions of voters will be disenfranchised by these dates. \" the republican national committee has also complained about the debate schedule, which can be seen here. The presidential debates will be on monday, sept. 26; sunday, oct. 9; and wednesday, oct. 19; the vp debate is set for tuesday, oct. 4.",

The national umbrella organization said it received $ 50,000 in online donations thursday after trump released his prelminary budget, reports reuters. The typical daily total? more like $ 1,000. As usa today and the washington post explain, however, it's a little early to suggest that the program will be decimated by the white house. For one thing, meals on wheels is not a federal program and does not receive money directly from the federal government. Instead, it ends up with a mixture of federal, state, and city funds. While trump has proposed an overall 17.9 % cut for the department of health and human services, the specific impact on the group is unclear. \"some of the stories are just either grossly wrong or nearly grossly wrong, all the stories about how we cut meals on wheels, \" white house budget chief mick mulvaney said on nbc's meet the press. Still, trump did propose elminating hud's community development block grants, from which meals on wheels gets about 3 % of its funding. And the program would almost certainly feel the pinch if the hhs cuts hold up, given that it gets most of its federal money through one of its agencies, the administration for community living. It's just too early to tell how bad it would be.

        "summary": "There are sure to be a few people buying tickets to cinderella this weekend simply to see frozen fever, which precedes it. If they stick around after the short, though, they might just witness a little magic courtesy of cate blanchett, lily james, and richard madden. Here's what critics are saying: \" the world didn't need yet another cinderella story, but the one we got is one of the best versions ever put on film, \" writes richard roeper at the chicago sun-times. Cinderella is \" an enchanting, exhilarating romantic adventure with gorgeous scenery, terrific sets, stellar cinematography, and oscar-worthy costumes, \" plus \" a first-rate cast. \" in particular, james \" sparkles, \" while blanchett is \" deliciously terrifying. \" betsy sharkey says the flick is \" as pure of heart as its heroine \" and \" floats across the screen like a gossamer confection, full of elegant beauty and quiet grace. \" helena bonham carter, who plays the fairy godmother, is one of the best actors in the film, which \" follows the well-known classic fairy tale chapter and verse, \" she writes at the los angeles times. There's \" a good deal of cgi magic \" to boot. Joe neumaier at the new york daily news says cinderella is \" a ball for all. \" it's \" an often sparkling movie that never disrespects the kid audience even as it wins over the parents. \" it has also been updated for the new generation. James ' cinderella is \" often staunchly independent \" and \" doesn't wait for her prince; he realizes he can't live without her. \" mick lasalle, however, doesn't quite fall under cinderella's spell. \" every old and familiar element is done beautifully, \" but the additional elements and back story \" don't add to the experience, \" he writes at the san francisco chronicle. \" director kenneth branagh and his cast have done their best... But ultimately they are toiling in irrelevancy. \" the one update he did like: that cinderella is \" more than just a doormat. \" speaking of frozen, here's some good news for fans...",

It never feels a fraud and makes madden's playing of hopelessly devoted believable, though at times a bit too gobsmacked.

            "Disney's new live-action \"cinderella \" movie is not some re-imagined reboot in which the title character is an ardent feminist and there's a musical number about gender equality in the workplace.

        "summary": "President trump's brief but chilly comments to the new york post about steve bannon had the media scrambling to find sources willing to weigh in on one big question: is bannon in or out? the washington post spoke with 21 of the president's \" aides, confidants, and allies \" in a quest to answer that question. Here's what it and other media outlets are learning and speculating: first, know that trump added more fuel to the fire later wednesday with a second set of brief comments about bannon, this time during a wide-ranging wall street journal interview. An excerpt: \" i ' m my own strategist.... I ' m just saying that [ mr. Bannon ] is a guy who works for me, he's a good guy. But, i make my own decision. \" though it calls him a \" marked man, \" the post hesitates to establish a firm position, allowing that \" for now, at least, bannon may survive the turmoil. \" but it has two quotes that suggest otherwise: in one, an unnamed friend uses the metaphor of a dying relative being transitioned to hospice in describing bannon. And there's this from newt gingrich: \" bannon is a brilliant pirate... But white houses, in the end, are like the us navy... Very hard on pirates. \" the post also suggests the bannon-jared kushner friction may extend beyond kushner. It calls out ivanka, eric, and donald trump jr. As being bothered by what they see as an appearance of turmoil that could prove detrimental to their legacy and quest to expand trump-brand hotels. Though the new york times reports that bannon allies ( who are major trump donors ) have been holing up in recent days and imagining a path forward for bannon should he exit, it cites a well-placed source as saying no change is imminent. And bannon does have allies: one of them, jeff sessions, went to bat for him wednesday in an interview with laura ingraham, per the hill: \" i ' m an admirer of steve bannon, \" he said. At fivethirtyeight, perry bacon jr. Advises us to \" watch not for the decline of bannon, but for the decline of bannonism, \" which bacon names as one of the four ideological styles espoused by those near trump. He writes that knowing who might replace bannon would be the biggest clue, and explains the difference between gary cohn or stephen miller stepping up. At cnn, gregory krieg offers up a sort of answer to bacon's question, writing the \" emerging wisdom \" is that cohn and kushner will be in",

Eight children were kept in a single bedroom with plywood covering the only window; authorities found two 2-year-old children and a 5-year-old girl tied to filthy mattresses, a welfare worker has testified. The little girl is legally blind, and \" appeared to be in a daze, \" said the worker. Some ten adults were also living in the crowded home. The children ranged in age from five months to 11, two of the youngest appeared to be suffering from pneumonia, and another had a black eye and a knocked-out tooth, reports ap. Adults in the house said the children were tied at night or during naps for their \" safety, \" but one child reported being kept in the room for days at a time, said the welfare worker. All of the children have been placed in foster care, and a criminal investigation is continuing. \"our primary concern was to make sure that the children were stable and safe, \" said an official. The crowded home is owned by the mother of mark e. Marsh iii, who was convicted in michigan of criminal sexual conduct with a 15-year-old girl, reports cbs. He has listed the dayton home as his residence on the state's online sex offender registry. His mother was investigated in 2009 after authorities received a report that she had punched a child in the house, which includes a number of curtained outbuildings in the backyard. Police haven't revealed the identities of the parents of all the children. The address was also home to two 16-year-old runaway boys who had heard the house \" was fun, \" according to court testimony.",

In the study published in the journal of spatial science ( one that was temporarily delayed by the artist's lawyers because he apparently didn't like the way the study was originally being promoted ), scientists from queen mary university of london applied the statistical technique to map the locations of the mysterious artist's alleged works throughout london and bristol, then matched them up to places where a short list of suspects live, work, and congregate. The economist notes the researchers pinpointed 140 locations where artwork believed to be banksy's appeared — including a pub, playing fields, and four different residential addresses — and those locations all matched up with gunningham. \" what i thought i would do is pull out the 10 most likely suspects, evaluate all of them, and not name any, \" co-author steven le comber tells the bbc. \" but it rapidly became apparent that there is only one serious suspect, and everyone knows who it is. \" gunningham has long been named as that \" serious suspect \": the daily mail ided him as such back in 2008. \" if you google ' banksy ' and ' gunningham, ' you get something like 43,500 hits, \" le comber tells the bbc. Geographic profiling is most often used in criminology — tagging minor incidents that could be terrorist-based ( e.g., graffiti ) to stop more-severe attacks is one example — but the bbc notes it's also increasingly being used for other purposes, such as tracking infectious disease outbreaks.

The russians, the campaign argues, are desperately trying to get donald trump elected. Clinton spokesperson glen caplin told fox, \" the timing shows you that even putin knows trump had a bad weekend and a bad debate. \" wikileaks claims to be in possession of more than 50,000 of podesta's emails, so observers can more than likely expect to see more of these releases in the weeks leading up to the election.",

Now researchers at the university of pennsylvania say their new study, to be published in the journal ps: political science and politics, may be the very first done outside of a lab to show that the lessons learned in a work of fiction seem to shape a reader's political ideologies — namely, that those who've read the harry potter series are less inclined to like donald trump. The effect is magnified among those who've read more of the series ' books, with each book read corresponding with a 2- to 3-point drop in trump's favorability on a scale going to 100. The study looked at the survey responses of 1,142 people in 2014 and 2016 and found, among other things, that watching the films didn't produce the same effect as reading did. The atlantic warns that \" observational data can't confirm causality, \" but it surmises that because the books \" reinforce the virtues of diversity and acceptance \" and consistently reveal the \" dangers of cults of personalities and authoritarianism, \" it's not a stretch to suggest that these messages have helped to shape readers ' outlook.

        "summary": "In what could be the largest defamation suit in us history, beef products inc. ( bpi ) is having its day in court after claiming the company lost revenue over an abc news investigative report that described its product as \"pink slime. \" the wall street journal reports that a 12-person jury heard opening statements monday in south dakota as bpi makes the case against abc and reporter jim avila for suggesting \"that bpi's product was not beef or meat, had little or no nutritional value, and was not safe to eat. \" according to the hollywood reporter, the original report aired in 2012 and was titled, \"pink slime meat investigation — do you know what's in your food? \" it centered around bpi's lean finely textured beef ( lftb ) product, which is approved by the department of agriculture, but was called out by an industry whistleblower. Though lftb was dubbed by a usda microbiologist as \"pink slime, \" family-owned beef products claims that abc used the term to smear the company, causing clients to cancel orders and sales to drop so drastically the company was forced to lay off 700 employees and close three of its four processing plants. Abc lawyers claim that the report repeatedly assured viewers that lftb was safe to eat, stating \"there is not a shred of evidence, let alone clear and convincing proof, that abc intended to convey the message that lftb is 'unsafe for public consumption. ' \" bpi, which calls the report \"fake news, \" must prove that abc's motivations were based in malice. A new state food disparagement law that allows plaintiffs to triple damages could up bpi's $ 1.9 billion complaint to almost $ 6 billion should the company win.",

            "On monday, two huge trials will be commencing. One is the bill cosby case, which will undoubtedly attract throngs of reporters to norristown, pennsylvania, eager to find out the fate of one of the most famous individuals in the world. Is there enough evidence to convict cosby and send him to jail for up to 30 years for allegedly sexually assaulting ex-temple university employee andrea constand more than a decade ago? how will the dozens of other cosby accusers factor? will race play a role? will cosby's legal team be able to use this trial to \" change the optics \"? all good questions, but i won't be there for answers. Because i ' m attending the other trial. That would be the one that abc is facing in south dakota over a series of news reports in 2012 about lean finely textured beef ( lftb ), which critics have dubbed \" pink slime. \" since beef products inc. Filed claims against abc, news anchor diane sawyer and star correspondent jim avila in september, 2012, the case has hardly been a secret, yet it also hasn't received nearly the amount of attention it deserves. There's solid reasons for that — and for why the trial won't attract the circus that one can expect to circle cosby next week. More about that in a moment. First, it's important to appreciate the stakes. Bpi claims that the \" pink slime \" reports tarnished its reputation, caused the closure of several plants, led to hundreds of laid-off workers, and prompted customers including supermarkets and restaurants to cancel orders. But was abc's reporting untrue? bpi contends that reasonable viewers would infer from watching the broadcasts that its product — found in 70 percent of ground beef, according to abc — is unsafe, not nutritious, and not really beef nor meat. Further, abc is accused of implying that bpi had engaged in improper conduct to win regulatory approval of lftb. The plaintiff also alleges that the mere use of the term \" pink slime \" — even if it was attributed to scientists working for the usda — conveyed a harmful, misleading message. Last september, abc begged south dakota judge cheryle gering to reject claims"

China's lunar new year celebrations begin feb. 8, and those trying to travel home ahead of the holiday via the main guangzhou railway station on monday found themselves — and at least 100,000 other people, reports the guardian — stymied by winter weather. With 23 trains delayed by rare snow elsewhere in the country, passengers found themselves stuck inside and around the station, where the bbc reports more than 5,000 officers were dispatched to keep an eye on them. The wall street journal reports a crowd of 34,000 was still stuck there as of tuesday morning. It cites a mind-boggling estimate from china's xinhua news agency: that as many as 2.9 billion trips will be made to and from home, \" via road, railway, air, and water, \" between the 40-day period that runs jan. 24 to march 3; it's typically framed as the largest annual human migration on the planet. Shanghaiist points out it's not the first time the station has been a scene of misery: some 80,000 people were stuck there in 2013 due to a landslide.

Her lawsuit states that the commercial for the $ 20 fill-up shows \" an overflowing bucket of chicken, \" according to fortune. \"i came home and said, 'where's the chicken? ' i thought i was going to have a couple of meals, \" wurtzburger tells the post. Wurtzburger is living off social security and was splurging on kfc as a treat. Kfc says its menu clearly states the $ 20 fill-up comes with eight pieces, and that's exactly what wurtzburger got. It explained to her that it has to show the bucket overflowing so viewers can see the chicken. \"if you want the public to look at your chicken, put it in a dish, \" she retorts. Wurtzburger also takes issue with the ad's claim that the eight-piece fill-up can feed a family of four. \" they're small pieces, \" she says. Kfc offered the dissatisfied wurtzburger $ 70 in coupons, but she turned them down, cbs new york reports. She's now suing kfc for $ 20 million. \"it's the principle of the matter, \" she says. \"sometimes you gotta hit people where they feel the hurt. \" kfc calls wurtzburger's lawsuit \" meritless. \" ( a judge dismissed a lawsuit against starbucks over something even \" young children \" can understand. )",

But the freedom is expected to last only about a day as lawmakers race to make the drugs illegal again, reports thejournal.ie.

Lawmakers knew the decision was potentially looming and had legislation prepared in advance, but it will take about 24 hours to get it in place. \" all substances controlled by means of government orders made under section 2( 2 ) cease to be controlled with immediate effect, and their possession ceases to be an offense, \" says ireland's department of health, as per the irish times. \" these include ecstasy, benzodiazepines, and new psychoactive substances, so-called ' headshop drugs.

            "Updated 6.15pm the dáil is to sit late tonight to pass emergency legislation in order to reclassify certain drugs, including ecstasy and magic mushrooms, as illegal following a court ruling this morning which has temporarily made them legal. A ruling in the court of appeal on the misuse of drugs act 1977 this morning effectively means that the possession of certain drugs, which had been illegal, is currently legal. The court ruling found that the 1977 act was being added to via ministerial order without recourse to the oireachtas, in violation of article 15 of the constitution. Ministerial orders had been used nine times since the act's inception to outlaw the possession of drugs like ecstasy, ketamine, magic mushrooms, benzos and other drugs. Speaking to reporters today, health minister leo varadkar explained: \"it is still the case that the sale, supply, export or import of such substances remains",
            "Minister for health leo varadkar has confirmed the government is to rush through emergency legislation to ban the possession of certain drugs. Speaking to reporters at leinster house on tuesday, he confirmed the drugs included ecstasy, cat, \"magic mushrooms \" and substances commonly known as head shop drugs. \"my objective as minister for health is to protect public health and that's why we are going to bring this emergency legislation to ban possession of these substances, \" mr varadkar said. He stressed the sale, supply, import and export of the drugs remained illegal. Possession is technically legal, albeit temporarily, until the emergency legislation is passed, although it remains illegal to purchase the substances. Mr varadkar said an appeal to the supreme court was under consideration by the government, but a situation whereby nothing was done immediately could not be allowed. Referring to the drugs, he said:",
            "The minister for health says dozens of people found guilty of drugs offences could now have their convictions overturned - and warned the supply, sale, import and export of ecstasy and other drugs remains illegal.

            "Updated 6.15pm the dáil is to sit late tonight to pass emergency legislation in order to reclassify certain drugs, including ecstasy and magic mushrooms, as illegal following a court ruling this morning which has temporarily made them legal. A ruling in the court of appeal on the misuse of drugs act 1977 this morning effectively means that the possession of certain drugs, which had been illegal, is currently legal. The court ruling found that the 1977 act was being added to via ministerial order without recourse to the oireachtas, in violation of article 15 of the constitution. Ministerial orders had been used nine times since the act's inception to outlaw the possession of drugs like ecstasy, ketamine, magic mushrooms, benzos and other drugs. Speaking to reporters today, health minister leo varadkar explained: \"it is still the case that the sale, supply, export or import of such substances remains",
            "Minister for health leo varadkar has confirmed the government is to rush through emergency legislation to ban the possession of certain drugs. Speaking to reporters at leinster house on tuesday, he confirmed the drugs included ecstasy, cat, \"magic mushrooms \" and substances commonly known as head shop drugs. \"my objective as minister for health is to protect public health and that's why we are going to bring this emergency legislation to ban possession of these substances, \" mr varadkar said. He stressed the sale, supply, import and export of the drugs remained illegal. Possession is technically legal, albeit temporarily, until the emergency legislation is passed, although it remains illegal to purchase the substances. Mr varadkar said an appeal to the supreme court was under consideration by the government, but a situation whereby nothing was done immediately could not be allowed. Referring to the drugs, he said:",
            "The minister for health says dozens of people found guilty of drugs offences could now have their convictions overturned - and warned the supply, sale, import and export of ecstasy and other drugs remains illegal.

        "summary": "The us and israel pitched a fit, but it ultimately wasn't enough to fully stop poland from moving ahead with its controversial holocaust law. Polish president andrzej duda on tuesday announced he would sign a bill that prohibits speech that states or suggests his nation was complicit in nazi germany's crimes. In a concession to critics, though, duda will have the constitutional tribunal examine the law; bloomberg reports the court has the power to force lawmakers to alter the law's language in whole or part. The new york times quotes duda as saying he's adding that step because the \" very painful, delicate issue \" needs to be handled thoughtfully, though the times sees the move as doing little to assuage those who say it could curtail free speech and whitewash the role some poles played in the killing of jews during world war ii. Duda said that should the court clear the law, he'd like to see it specify exactly what type of speech is subject to prosecution. As it stands now, using the phrase \" polish death camp \" to refer to auschwitz and other nazi-constructed concentration camps within the country can result in a prison term; claiming the polish nation \" is responsible or co-responsible for nazi crimes \" is punishable by up to three years. In a washington post column, anne applebaum writes of the law's \" ludicrous \" potential: \" will the long arm of the polish state reach out to academic conferences in tokyo or buenos aires if someone uses an incorrect phrase?... In a pompous speech the polish prime minister gave supporting the law, an automatic translation service made it appear as if he himself said that ' camps where millions of jews were murdered were polish.'should he go to prison, too? should google translate? \"",

From what cops can piece together, jeffrey alan lash claimed to be a spy — sometimes a hybrid human-alien spy — and just before he died in his car on july 4, he told his fiancee that government agencies would take care of his body, the guardian reports. She left town on his orders and called police two weeks later after discovering his rotting corpse was still in the vehicle in the upscale pacific palisades neighborhood. Police found a stash of 1,200 firearms in the apartment they shared — which has now risen to 1,500, according to the los angeles times — along with $ 230,000 cash, explosives, and 6.5 tons of ammo. Police say the weapons were legally acquired and that out of 14 vehicles registered to lash, they've found eight in various la locations — including an suv that can drive underwater, the ap reports. The partner of lash's late father tells the times that he was a loner and that she lost touch with him years ago and didn't know where his money came from. Police say lash had late-stage cancer and that foul play is not suspected in his death. He had told his fiancee that his illness was caused by chemical weapons exposure on a secret mission, reports the guardian, which notes that the \" tentative conclusion \" investigators have reached is that he was so caught up in a fantasy world of spying that others around him started to believe it.",

Thankfully, he survives to put on an epic, yet gory show en route to revenge. Early reports claimed leo has this year's best male actor oscar in the bag. Do critics agree? alejandro iñárritu's follow-up to birdman \" features a battalion of very fine, hardworking actors, none more diligently committed than mr. Dicaprio, \" writes manohla dargis at the new york times. \" iñárritu isn't content to merely seduce you with ecstatic beauty and annihilating terror; he wants to blow your mind, \" and at times he succeeds. But then he \" blows it when he moves from the material to the mystical and tries to elevate an ugly story into a spiritual one. \" \" few heroes in movie history have endured more torment than this one, \" and \" in a role with little dialogue, mr. Dicaprio summons up impressive resources to convey the horror of glass's plight, \" writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. But \" everything screams primal in the revenant — the lethal force of a wild animal, the savagery of man against man, the sustaining power of revenge, \" he adds. \" i came out of this would-be epic feeling physically exhausted, psychically mauled, and none the better for wear. \" the flick isn't for everyone, \" but for those to whom the subject matter appeals, it will be among 2015's most memorable theatrical options, \" writes james berardinelli at reelviews. It's \" a more visceral and devastating look at seemingly impossible survival than even the martian, \" and features \" gorgeous cinematography. \" its subdued nature also helps showcase \" the most raw, primal performance dicaprio has ever given. \" a warning: the bear scene may be too bloody for some. But bear the suffering and you ' ll be rewarded with \" the power of cinema unleashed, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. \" surviving nature is iñárritu's subject, and he delivers with magisterial brilliance, \" while dicaprio supplies \" a virtuoso performance, thrilling in its brute force and silent eloquence. \" travers can't help but mention that bear scene. \" the bear is a product of an expert visual-effects team. But not for a second will you doubt you're seeing the real thing, \" he writes. \" this is one for the time capsule. \"",

( photo: ap ) kevin spacey, steven seagal and anthony anderson, three hollywood stars who have been accused of sexual assault, won't be charged in three cases, either because the statute of limitations has expired or their accusers refused to talk to police, the los angeles district attorney's hollywood sex-crimes task force announced tuesday. This doesn't mean the coast is clear – at least not for spacey, 59, and seagal, 66. Both have been accused in other alleged assault cases currently under review by the task force established by district attorney jackie lacey last year to assess the wave of sexual harassment-related police reports filed in the wake of the #metoo movement. Word of the \" declinations, \" as they are called ( because prosecutors decline to press charges ), arrived in a statement emailed to usa today from greg risling, the spokesman for the task force.

The hollywood reporter points out a number of minority actors who were overlooked, including benicio del toro in sicario and idris elba in beasts of no nation, both of whom were nominated for baftas. Elba was also nominated for a golden globe and a sag-aftra. Will smith ( concussion ) and michael b. Jordan ( creed ) were also snubbed by the oscars despite being nominated by other groups, usa today reports, and both concussion and beasts were completely shut out. Furthermore, straight outta compton was nominated for original screenplay but not for best picture, despite being nominated for or winning similar awards from numerous other groups. As tmz points out, the only people from the nwa biopic to get oscar nods were the screenwriters, who are both white. And just eight movies were nominated for best picture, so there was still room for the film if the academy wanted to include it. The hollywood reporter and people run down other snubs. Some of the biggest surprises: carol, seen as a \" shoo-in \" for best picture, didn't get a nomination. The martian did get a best picture nod, but director ridley scott wasn't nominated in his category. Going clear: scientology and the prison of belief was big news, but failed to get a best documentary nod. Steve jobs got acting nominations, but screenwriter aaron sorkin wasn't nominated despite winning the golden globe in the category on sunday. Quentin tarantino's the hateful eight was nominated for a number of awards, but not best picture, best director, or best adapted screenplay. The paul walker tribute song, \" see you again, \" from furious 7 was not nominated in the best original song category.

Although the debate, to be hosted by msnbc, was first proposed by the new hampshire union leader, the paper would have a decreased presence at the dnc's request as the party tries to reassert control over a debate process that has become chaotic in recent days.

Jill kelley has hired washington super-attorney abbe lowell and crisis manager judy smith — the equivalent of arming with a howitzer and a jet fighter — even though the fbi says its investigation is over, gawker reports. To put it in perspective: smith's past clients include kobe bryant and monica lewinsky, and lowell has represented bill clinton and john edwards. You only hire lowell \" when you're seriously f -- ked, \" quips gawker.

Greek yogurt maker chobani has sued jones ' infowars for publishing what it calls fake and defamatory stories related to the company's plant in twin falls, idaho, reports buzzfeed. Two examples: one video headlined, \" idaho yogurt maker caught importing migrant rapists \" and a story blaming chobani for a \" 500 % increase in tuberculosis in twin falls. \" chobani founder hamdi ulukaya wants the stories pulled and $ 10,000 in damages, but jones says he isn't budging. \" i ' m never giving up, i love this, \" he said in an audio statement, per the washington post. \" they have jumped the trillion-pound great white shark on this baby. \" jones accused billionaire george soros of being behind the suit, just weeks after accusing him of staging a chemical weapons attack in syria. The migrant rape story stems from an incident in june 2016 in which three refugee boys, ages 14, 10, and, 7, sexually assaulted a 5-year-old girl in a laundry room, reports the idaho statesman. Details remain sealed, but prosecutors said one boy admitted touching the girl while the others filmed on a phone. The assault later was conflated by right-wing sites into a gang rape at knifepoint by syrian men. Jones previously called the sandy hook shooting a hoax and said the government staged the 9/11 attacks, though in a recent court hearing in a child custody case, his lawyer argued that jones ' public persona is merely performance art. Ulukaya is a turkish immigrant who has drawn national attention, both praise and scorn, for his advocacy of refugees. He employs more than 300 refugees at the idaho plant and another in new york.",

An international team of paleontologists has announced the discovery of the largest known dinosaur foot, which belonged to a close relative of the brachiosaurus now dubbed \" bigfoot. \" appropriately so, as a nearly complete left hind-foot fossil totaling 13 bones, found two decades ago in the black hills area of wyoming alongside separate and smaller brachiosaur remains, shows the 80-foot-long sauropod had feet that were about 3 feet wide, report live science and gizmodo. \" there are tracks and other incomplete skeletons from australia and argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but those gigantic skeletons were found without the feet, \" researcher emanuel tschopp explains in a release. Described in journal peerj, \" this beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in north america. \" researchers, who compared the foot to those of other dino species, believe it came from a brachiosaur that lived 150 million years ago, making it the first brachiosaur foot known to come from north america's late jurassic period, per mashable. Though it's not enough to identify a specific species, it's evidence that brachiosaurs covered a larger area of north america, from eastern utah to northwestern wyoming, than previously known. \" this is surprising \" as \" many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas, \" tschopp says. Noting the discovery occurred \" several hundreds of miles from where we thought these guys were, \" fellow researcher david burnham will look to answer new questions: \" is it a different species than the brachiosaurs down south? or maybe they were migrating north to south? \" ( these tire-sized dino prints hid in plain sight. )",

        "summary": "The trump administration's massive overhaul of how the us targets and deports undocumented immigrants is becoming clearer after two memos from homeland security secretary john kelly were released tuesday. The policy changes in those memos could open the door to millions of deportations thanks to classifying most undocumented immigrants as \" priorities. \" here's what you need to know: department of homeland security officials tells pro publica the plan is to send migrants illegally entering the us from mexico back to mexico regardless of what country they're actually from. Seeing the reaction to the memos, the trump administration is currently trying to avoid a \" sense of panic \" among immigrants, insisting the goal isn't \" mass deportations, \" the washington post reports. Officials say undocumented immigrants brought to the us as young children, also known as dreamers, will only be targeted for deportation if they commit a crime, according to the new york times. But the guardian reports undocumented immigrants no longer have to be charged with a crime or convicted of one to become priorities for deportation; just being suspected of a crime is enough, even for minor offenses like shoplifting or traffic violations. The new policy makes detention mandatory for anyone illegally entering the us, which could make it a lot harder for people escaping violence in their home countries to plead their case for asylum, according to vox. It remains to be seen whether the republican-led congress will be willing to pay for the massive expansion of deportation efforts. The administration wants 10,000 new ice agents, which could cost between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion in the first year, the washington post reports.

This diagram shows the current position of new horizons, along with its path so far ( in green ) and the road ahead ( in red ). Nasa's new horizons spacecraft is less than one month away from its flyby of pluto and in great shape for what promises to be a truly epic encounter with the dwarf planet. New horizons, the first spacecraft ever sent to investigate pluto, has been traveling for nine long years and has just 20 million miles ( 32 million kilometers ) to go before it makes a historic flyby of the dwarf planet. During its close encounter with pluto, new horizons will fly within 7,750 miles ( 12,500 km ) of the dwarf planet and capture the first-ever close-up views of the icy world. [ see",

        "summary": "A massive army of terracotta warriors, commissioned by china's first emperor in 246 bc, has mesmerized archaeologists since its discovery in 1974. Slowly, researchers have learned the secrets of the amazing clay statues, including how they were painted, but were still puzzled by how their realistic features were created. Now, after creating 3d models of the warriors using new imaging technology, university college london researchers have found the statues were perhaps modeled after real soldiers rather than given standard-issue noses, ears, and mouths \" via a sort of mr. Potato head strategy, \" explains archaeologist andrew brevan. Their ears offered up the greatest clue: ears vary so much among humans that they're \" as effective as a fingerprint \" in terms of identification, he says. Researchers studied the left ears of 30 warriors and found \" considerable variation, \" reports national geographic. As the researchers wrote in the journal of archaeological science, \" this tentatively supports the hypothesis that the warriors were intended to constitute a real army.... It remains to be seen whether the ears themselves exhibit comparable levels of individuality to what we might expect in a real population of adult males ( as seems likely from the warrior height distribution ). \" that last statement is a reference to a 2003 study published in antiquity in which the height of 734 terracotta warriors was analyzed; researchers found \" the size of the terracotta figures could well represent the true physical stature of the chinese infantry. \" ( newly discovered bones may solve a fascinating greek mystery. )",

The adolescent ruler commissioned a massive tomb furnished with everything he'd need for the next life, including an entire army of life-size terra-cotta warriors, from mighty generals to humble infantrymen. Arranged in battle formation in pits near the emperor's tomb, the clay army stood watch for more than 2,000 years. Then, in 1974, local farmers rediscovered the site while digging a well. Since then, archaeologists have puzzled over how ancient artisans produced the estimated 7,000 lifelike clay soldiers, right down to their stylish goatees and plaits of braided hair.

            "Structure-from-motion and multiview-stereo together offer a computer vision technique for reconstructing detailed 3d models from overlapping images of anything from large landscapes to microscopic features. Because such models can be generated from ordinary photographs taken with standard cameras in ordinary lighting conditions, these techniques are revolutionising digital recording and analysis in archaeology and related subjects such as palaeontology, museum studies and art history. However, most published treatments so far have focused merely on this technique's ability to produce low-cost, high quality representations, with one or two also suggesting new opportunities for citizen science. However, perhaps the major artefact scale advantage comes from significantly enhanced possibilities for 3d morphometric analysis and comparative taxonomy. We wish to stimulate further discussion of this new research domain by considering a case study using a famous and contentious set of archaeological objects: the terracotta warriors of china's first emperor."

The film stars justin timberlake as richie, a princeton grad who puts himself through school by playing poker; when he goes belly up, he hunts down online mastermind ivan ( ben affleck ) and gets involved in his high-stakes, dangerous business. But for critics, it's becoming a putdown contest: \" even with its glossy costa rican setting, runner runner... Is a vacant excursion with plot holes the size of a small caribbean island, \" writes claudia puig at usa today. \" remember the old ben affleck, the one who made 28 consecutive bad movies before he turned out to be a pretty good director? \" writes kyle smith at the new york post. \" he's back! behold, the second coming of... Badfleck. \" ouch. The film has \" an intriguing setup, \" writes richard roeper at the chicago sun-times, but it \" devolves into a by-the-books thriller with richie paired off against ivan in a race against the clock and the fbi agent ( anthony mackie ) who talks as if his entire vocabulary was programmed by watching tv crime dramas and b-movies. \" a bright spot, as per betsy sharkey at the la times: \" fortunately we do have timberlake. He has a way of breathing life into even deadened moments. You want to watch him. But like most stars, his acting is better when the plotting is smarter. \" at least there's a substantial side to runner runner: it has landed in the middle of a regulatory battle over online gambling, reports the ap.",

The australian associated press reports on the case of sam kanizay, a melbourne 16-year-old who spent about a half-hour soaking his legs, sore from sports, at dendy street beach in brighton on saturday. He emerged with his legs dripping in blood. \" as soon as we wiped [ his legs ] down, they kept bleeding, \" sam's father, jarrod kanizay, tells the aap. ( very graphic photo here. ) \" they ate through sam's skin and made it bleed profusely. \" and they left doctors stumped. But there have been theories aplenty, per the new york times and the ap: some were sure that sea lice, a group of crustaceans known as isopods, were responsible. The head of the dolphin research institute points the finger at another group of crustaceans called amphipods; another marine expert speculates it was jellyfish larvae. As for thomas cribb, a parasite expert from the university of queensland, \" it's not a parasite i've ever come across. \" in a quest to find the answer, jarrod kanizay headed for the beach sunday night with a wetsuit, a pool net, and pieces of steak to use as bait, and captured \" thousands of little mite-type creatures. \" he has shared an unappetizing video of them noshing on the meat. A marine biologist with museums victoria analyzed a sample taken by kanizay and says they're lysianassid amphipods, or sea fleas. He speculates they have a leech-like anti-coagulant that kept the blood flowing from sam's legs, and said the teen may not have felt the bites because of the chill of the winter water.

That other substance was kitty litter, which is used to absorb liquid in the drums, jim conca, who worked at the plant from 2000 to 2010, tells the carlsbad current-argus. The problem, conca says, is that the facility switched from non-organic litter to organic litter. \" i ' m just dying to know why this happened and who approved it, because it was a dumb idea, \" he says. \" you just can't make a change to the procedure without reviewing it. \" a new mexico official confirms that the energy department is discussing the litter theory, among other possibilities.

No, the government isn't slipping in an extra zero. But it is including, as always, an eight-digit serial number. And as the boston globe explains, currency collectors will pay big if the numbers are \" fancy. \" that's the collectors'term, not the globe's, for serial numbers that fall in a number of categories: there are \" low \" ( 00000001 through 00000100 ), \" ladders \" ( 43210987 ), \" radar ' ( 43788734 ), \" solids \" ( 33333333 ), and \" repeaters \" ( 82118211 ). Then there are random ones: 31415927 ( pi ) or 07041776 ( read that as 07/04/1776 ). The low number ones are among the most valuable, with new $ 100 bills with 00000001 expected to sell for as much as $ 15,000. ( before the serial number you ' ll see one or two letters; these indicate which federal reserve bank issued it. As such, there can be more than one bill in any denomination with the same serial number in a given year. ) so how do you get your hands on one? it helps if you have friends in high and very secure places. Bank employees, especially vault workers, are typically able to swap out a normal bill for a fancy one, says the director of currency of a dallas auction house, and since bricks of money are marked with the serial number range, they can spot the bills fairly easily. But no one is going to become an instant millionaire: bills in the 00000001 to 00000100 range are specifically split up. Still, feel free to pull out your wallet and take a look: philly.com notes that coolserialnumbers is looking to buy these bills. ( click for another wild money story. )",

That's downright airy compared to dhaka, bangladesh, which ranks as the planet's densest city at 115,000 people per square mile. And as the guardian reports, it's not just overflowing with people. Dhaka has a serious sewer problem, one that's exacerbated during monsoon season, when drains that can't keep up with the population and the weather cause \" the low-lying city [ to fill ] with water like a bathtub, \" writes poppy mcpherson. That has created the existence of what has been referred to as the \" world's worst job \": sewer cleaner. The cleaners'tools can be as primitive as bamboo sticks plunged into clogged manholes; sometimes, the cleaners themselves are the ones plunged into the filth. It can be deadly work, no more so than in 2008, when seven cleaners tasked with clearing a manhole got sucked in; onlookers used shovels and hammers to bust open the road and retrieve them. Only three survived. And even the unscathed aren't unscathed: \" the sewerage lines are acidic and poisonous due to rotten filth, \" explains one sewer cleaner. \" so cleaners are 100 % sure to have health problems, especially skin problems. \" mcpherson explains that the city's mughal-era canals used to provide drainage, but after bangladesh gained its independence in 1971, they were filled in to make way for development. The city agreed to move forward on a plan to resurrect some of those canals — but that was five years ago, and little has been accomplished. Read the full story here.",

And from the looks of photos already trickling out on facebook, this is one party not to be missed. Facebook kicked off its hackathon, hackathon 31 to be exact, at 7 p.m. Pacific thursday evening. A crowd of several thousand employees gathered in an outdoor make-shift arena in the middle of the campus ' corridor ( the same place where the bell-ringing will take place ) to watch zuckerberg and senior staffers rally the troops for one final night pre-ipo hacking. Zuckerberg, as pictured below, was greeted with a standing ovation from the crowd. Thursday afternoon, facebook priced its shares at $ 38 apiece for a $ 104 billion valuation. The company will debut on the nasdaq tomorrow under the \"fb \" ticker symbol and raise $ 16 billion ( up to $ 18.4 billion with its over-allotment option ) through its offering"

Authorities say they were among 48 staff and students from six countries who were touring the city on a chartered bus before classes started monday. Another 51 people were injured in the crash, including 15 critically, though some have been upgraded to serious condition, reports seattlepi.com. \" i turned and looked, and that's when i saw the carnage, \" a 61-year-old passenger on the ducks vehicle tells the seattle times. \" people i was sitting next to weren't there … they had been thrown completely out of the back of the duck. \" he says he felt the rear of the vehicle fishtail before the crash. \" and just at that moment, i heard the driver go: ' oh, no! ' \" a witness originally said the ducks vehicle experienced some kind of malfunction and perhaps lost a wheel before the crash. A man driving one of two suvs also involved in the accident agrees something went wrong, noting he saw red fluid leaking from the duck's front left tire, which appeared to seize up, before the vehicle slammed into the driver's side of the bus. Seattle police say they're investigating a possible mechanical failure on the ducks vehicle but add it's too early to pinpoint a cause of the accident. \" we've had a terrible tragedy, \" mayor ed murray says. \" the thoughts and prayers of this city go out to everyone — the families and those impacted. \" he adds the ride the ducks tour has voluntarily taken its vehicles off seattle's streets for now.",
