        "summary": "Its insights into the use of social media to promote entomology is just one reason a new scientific paper is making headlines. The other is that its co-author is an 8-year-old girl. Sophia spencer of canada has long loved creepy-crawlies, especially carrying them around on her shoulder, but her venture into the formal study of insects only began last year. That's when sophia's mom sent a letter to the entomological society of canada sharing how sophia was bullied for her love of bugs and requesting answers to her many questions about how to turn that love into a career, reports npr. Morgan jackson, an entomologist who runs the society's social media accounts, shared the letter on twitter and was stunned when more than a thousand responses poured in. \" i've been that girl, became an entomologist &amp; still proudly wear bugs on my shoulder, \" read one response, which included a photo proving it to be true, highlighted by the toronto star. The outpouring of support gave jackson an idea. He decided to research how social media can promote women in entomology and asked sophia to explain her experience, per quartz. Sophia — who now throws out words like \" stridulating \" — hopes her byline on the most popular paper ever published in the annals of the entomological society of america will be the first of many to come. \" i see myself growing up to become an entomologist, \" she says. \" it was cool to see other girls and grown-ups studying bugs. It made me feel like i could do it, too. \" ( read one female scientist's incredible tale of how adultery and a burglary could have derailed a brilliant career. )",

        "summary": "An australian woman who appeared to be in great shape suddenly died at age 25 — and doctors say protein supplements contributed to her death. Meegan hefford, a bodybuilder, had been complaining since early june about feeling \" weird \" and lethargic. On june 19, she was found unconscious in her apartment; three days later, she was dead, perthnow reports. Doctors determined she had urea cycle disorder, a genetic disorder caused by a mutation that ultimately makes a person unable to process protein intake. Instead of the normal processing that happens when protein is metabolized, in a person with urea cycle disorder, ammonia builds up in the bloodstream and can reach the brain if left untreated, causing brain damage, coma, or death. As part of her training for an upcoming competition, hefford, unaware she had the disorder, had ramped up her protein intake. The mom of two had been going to the gym, sometimes twice a day, and eating protein-rich foods. But she was also drinking protein shakes and taking supplements, and her death certificate lists both urea cycle disorder and \" intake of bodybuilding supplements \" as causes of death. Now her family is calling for protein supplements to be more carefully restricted, and for warnings to be issued about high-protein diets. A few experts are already weighing in, with a doctor warning it's better to eat a balanced diet than to use supplements, and a dietitian noting that people generally don't need to be taking supplements to get enough protein, including very active people. Even the international federation of bodybuilding and fitness-western australia director agrees, saying protein supplements should carry warnings that excess protein can be dangerous, the west australian reports.

Bruce mcarthur, a 66-year-old self-employed landscaper, has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of five men who disappeared between 2012 and 2017, the cbc reports. The skeletal remains of at least three victims were found in huge concrete planters at a client's home, and police believe that a search of around 30 properties where mcarthur carried out work will uncover the remains of more victims. \" the city of toronto has never seen anything like this, \" police spokesman hank idsinga said monday. \" we do believe there are more... We have no idea how many more there are going to be, \" idsinga said, per the toronto star. \" he's taken some steps to cover his tracks and we have to uncover these victims and identify these victims. \" idsinga said numerous planters have been seized from around the city. Mcarthur — who also worked as a mall santa — was arrested earlier this month and charged with two murders. Police charged him with three more killings monday. All of the victims were in their 40s and 50s, and police say they're investigating mcarthur in connection with disappearances in toronto's \" gay village \" district going back as far as 2010 and possibly earlier.

Her father, george anthony, says that story is \" a bunch of crap. \" it's one of several revelations he made in the final episode of investigation discovery's three-part documentary series on the case, which concluded tuesday. Things to know about casey anthony: an american murder mystery: anthony suggested his daughter drugged caylee anthony on june 16, 2008, possibly with xanax she got through friends. He also suggested it wasn't the first time casey may have done this, noting caylee often slept for up to 13 hours at a time, per usa today. \" i believe that casey gave [ caylee ] something, \" george anthony said. \" caylee didn't wake up. \" when asked what the street name of xanax is, george replied, \" zanny. \" some sites are reading into the remark. His wife, cindy, tells investigation discovery she believes caylee's death was indeed an accidental drowning and that casey simply panicked. She says she's since forgiven casey and still speaks to her occasionally, reports the orlando sentinel. George, however, said he ' ll likely never speak to his daughter again, and adds, \" justice would be to have my daughter behind bars and have her suffer the way caylee suffered. \" how does the couple stay together with such diverging opinions? \" i don't think i could find anybody else that would understand my day-to-day ups and downs and what we go through other than him, \" says cindy, per usa today. Deadline suggests the series has been a big win for investigation discovery, the network owned by discovery communications. Sunday's premiere pulled in 2.9 million live, same-day viewers, making it the network's biggest series debut. The format in general is turning out to be a success. The washington post notes jonbenet: an american murder mystery took investigation discovery's top slot among its 2016 event series. What do the critics think? hal boedeker was mostly favorable in the sentinel, writing, \" i ' m usually no fan of re-enactments, but the program used them effectively, photographing stand-ins from a distance and never showing faces. \" there was a real \" you are there \" feeling to it.

What won't happen next is an outbreak of ebola on us soil, experts tell the ap, adding that emory is one of the best and safest places on the planet to treat the deadly virus. The hospital's infectious diseases unit is state of the art and has treated worse than ebola; in 2005 it handled sars patients, notes usa today. That hasn't stopped a slew of \" nasty emails \" and 100 or so calls to the cdc, says its director, questioning why the agency brought brantly stateside to begin with — and noting the cdc's shaky track record of late. \" i hope that our understandable fear of the unfamiliar does not trump our compassion when ill americans return to the us for care, \" says dr.

Well, franco now seems to have doubled down on that, with a new short story in vice titled \" bungalow 89. \" it's unclear whether the tale is supposed to be fictional ( gawker says yes, while jezebel calls it an \" essay \" ), but it is clear that a prominent character in the story is named \" lindsay lohan, \" and that character basically stalks franco's character, who refuses to have sex with her. The story ends: \" for nine months, while they fixed my house, i was staying in the bungalows.... Lindsay lohan was there too. The chateau was her home, and the staff were her servants. She got my room key. One night she came in at 3am. I woke up on the couch, trying not to look surprised. Instead of f --- ing her, i read her a short story about a neglected daughter.... Every night lindsay looked for me, and i hid. Out the window was hollywood. \" basically, it \" reads like an overlong explanation from franco that he did not sleep with lindsay lohan, \" writes aleksander chan for gawker. On jezebel, mark shrayber is even less charitable: \" james franco is angry at lindsay lohan for purportedly lying about him. And instead of just letting it go, he's going to give it back to her as good as he got it. \" the whole thing just proves franco \" really is just an aging pretentious graduate student or that sleazy un-tenured professor who sleeps with students, \" writes alanna bennett at bustle.",

Ibrahim cetin tells the hurriyet daily news that the two dungeons that were found were \" built like a prison. \" and while he deems it \" hard to estimate \" which room the man who served as dracula's inspiration was held in, \" he was around here, \" he says. Cetin didn't get much more specific than that, and the specifics of vlad iii and his captivity are equally murky. As livescience and ancient origins tell it, vlad, born in 1431, was held by the ottomans beginning in 1442, after he traveled with his father to a political meeting that ended up being a trap; his father was released, but vlad and his younger brother were held, reportedly in tokat castle. In the years that followed, his father and older brother were brutally killed; at some point, vlad's captivity ended and he began impaling ottoman invaders and enemies. Livescience reports that vlad is thought to have killed as many as 80,000 people, a quarter of whom were said to have been impaled and then displayed outside the city of targoviste as a way to deter the invading turks ( it worked ). Ibt reports archaeologists have been working at the castle since 2009 and previously found a long tunnel that the king's daughters may have used to access a roman bath.

Maj. Gen.

Niyombare said he would set up a temporary committee, of which he would be president, to govern until the dust settles, the ap notes; protesters reportedly celebrated after the announcement. But one of nkurunziza's aides said claims about the coup were \" a joke, \" and a tweet from the president's twitter account says the coup has been foiled and that those responsible are being sought to be brought to justice. However, the bbc notes that witnesses are reporting forces supporting the overthrow are trying to push their way into the building where the state's broadcaster is housed, and a western diplomat has told cnn that gunfire is ringing out through the city. The president reportedly canned niyombare in february as the director of the country's intelligence agency, the ap notes. As for his term limits, nkurunziza has claimed he can run for a third term because the country's constitution says a president can be picked by popular election to two five-year terms — he's nearing the end of his second term, but he was elected by the burundi parliament for the first term.",

The 56-foot mv butiraoi ferry was carrying at least 50 people, and perhaps 100, when it departed on a two-day, 150-mile trip from nonouti to the island of betio on jan. 18, reports the bbc. It didn't arrive as scheduled and, for unknown reasons, new zealand's military — which is responsible for patrolling the area in question — wasn't notified until a week later, reports the new york times. An air search began on saturday, and seven passengers — including a 14-year-old girl — were found floating in a 16-foot aluminum dinghy on sunday, a search spokesman tells the times. The bbc counts the number of survivors at eight. An air commodore says the survivors are \" pretty dehydrated \" after a week \" in the baking sun. \" the guardian notes they didn't have water. Picked up by a fishing boat more than 100 miles from the nearest major island, they reportedly said the ferry split in two and sank; the vessel underwent repairs to a propeller shaft before departing after it ran aground on an atoll. Still, officials are optimistic that more survivors may be found. Kiribati's president, taneti maamau, says 100 people might've been on board the ferry, which had two dinghies, per the new zealand herald. Australian and american rescue teams are now en route to help search a 200,000-square-mile area 500 miles west of kiribati, a country made up of 33 atolls located halfway between hawaii and australia, per the guardian.",

You are a brilliant man who has persuasively argued against democracy itself, which you have characterized as a system of using short-term promises and preferences of people at the expense of long-term functioning, by having people choose between bundles of disparate policies preferred by by one candidate or another, just to show results till the next election. So after all those chapters in your books where you have given a strong case against democracy, why would you complain about democracy degenerating itself? you know that no matter how educated or how informed people are, these problems of democracy will always persist. And you know that for these very reasons are such arbitrary actions of government conducted. Why else is it that similar arbitrary actions by government have happened in western european nations, japan, south korea, and other high iq, high education nations? to say that the arbitrary solutions being considered by the government for the bp oil spill owe to an uneducated populace, as opposed to the system itself, makes us forget the root causes. Democracy is not a government of laws. Democracy does not respect private property or freedom. Democracy does not respect even basic civil liberties - else we wouldn't see so much police brutality and torture in democracies like pakistan, sri lanka",
            "The peaceful hamlet of mason city, iowa, hasn't been in the headlines much since it served as the model for river city in meredith willson's \" the music man. \" but this week, mason city raised a real fuhrer. The geniuses of the north iowa tea party erected a billboard in town depicting three leaders: adolf hitler ( with swastika ), vladimir lenin ( with hammer and sickle ) and barack obama ( with 2008 campaign logo ). Over hitler were the words \" national socialism, \" over lenin was \" marxist socialism \" and over obama was \" democrat socialism. \" \" radical leaders prey on the fearful &amp; na├ » ve, \" the billboard informed passing motorists. Folks, we've got trouble in river city. The tea partyers eventually took the billboard down -- to hush the national uproar they provoked, not because they thought they had done something wrong. \" there's going to be a lot of billboards just like this across the united states, \" the group's leader told the des moines register. He's probably right about that. The vile sign in mason city was not a one-off by a fringe group. It was a logical expression of a message supported by conservative thought leaders and propagated by high-level republican politicians. Late last month"

        "summary": "President trump unveiled a $ 4.4 trillion budget for 2019 on monday, and those with lots of free time on their hands can read it in full here. Before doing so, understand that it has somewhere around 0 % chance of being turned into law. As is the case with presidential budget proposals, it is more \" vision statement \" than realistic spending plan, in the words of the new york times. Here are some of the key points in trump's vision: no balanced budget: the plan surrenders on a gop goal of trying to eliminate the budget deficit in 10 years. It's a concession that the big tax-cut plan enacted last year and higher spending in some areas make that impossible, reports the washington post. Specifically, the budget sees a $ 984 billion deficit next year and $ 7 billion in new debt over the next decade. Military spending: trump calls for an increase to $ 716 billion for the pentagon, which usa today says would represent the biggest defense buildup since ronald reagan held office. The plan would add 25,900 troops to the current force of 1.3 million, and it calls for 10 new warships and increased production of f-35 and f-18 warplanes. Medicare cuts: the plan proposes cuts to domestic agencies such as the labor and interior departments, the epa, and and the national science foundation. It also would cut medicare by $ 554 billion over the next 10 years, including cuts in payments to hospitals and rehab facilities, reports the ap. Border wall: trump wants $ 18 billion for a wall on the mexican border, and additional money to hire more immigration agents, per usa today. Space station: the white house plans to end funding for the international space station by 2025, but the government would allot $ 150 million to help make sure that private businesses take over the station's operation in some as-yet unspecified capacity, per the ap. Trump also proposes spending $ 200 billion in federal money on infrastructure.",

In december, the federal reserve projected annualized growth of 2.2 percent over that period. The survey of professional forecasters estimated the annualized growth rate to be about 2.4 percent. The centerpiece of mr. Trump's budget is a plan to devote $ 200 billion over the next decade in new spending to improve the country's crumbling infrastructure, starting with $ 44.6 billion in 2019.

            "Election hangover a majority of americans don't know the results of the historic election that just took place we know, we know. Every week there's a new poll about the things americans don't know, so there's really no need to get all worked up about it at this point. Also, not everyone reads blogs all day, every day, like we ( and some of you, thank god ) do, etc. But still, it seems reasonable to expect that people would have absorbed the most basic information about an election that just happened two weeks ago and thoroughly dominated all forms of media. Yet over half of americans have not. According to a pew survey, only 46 percent of americans know that the republicans won the house but not the senate. \" about one-in-seven ( 14 % ) say the gop won both the house and senate; 8 % say they won just the senate; 5 % do not think they will have a majority in either chamber; and 27 % do not know. \" as a measure of how disengaged from politics young people become when a race does not revolve around an exciting young black man, only about a quarter of 18-to-29-year-olds were able to answer the question correctly. Public knows basic facts about politics, economics, but struggles",

According to data extrapolated from a cdc survey, bullying victims who are injured or threatened by a weapon at school are 800 % more likely to pack a weapon, and the effects are cumulative, so chronic-bullying victims are far more likely to carry a weapon. The result: more than 200,000 students are bringing weapons into high schools, discovery reports. \" when you combine \" the various \" risk factors, you see scary figures, \" says lead author andrew adesman. Researchers looked at the 20 % of us high school students who report having been bullied, most of whom are white, female, and in lower grades, medical daily reports. The numbers show that four categories of bullying victims — those who have cut school over safety concerns, had personal property stolen or damaged, suffered physical assault, and endured verbal torment — are almost 49 times more likely to have a weapon, and 34 times more likely to have a gun. But linking the data to school assaults isn't easy, nbc news notes, because some attackers are bullies ( the columbine shooters ) while others are bullying victims ( like, apparently, alex hribal ). One anti-bullying advocate says the solution is to break the \" code of silence \" among many students: \" we have to give our kids permission and support to report what they hear when a peer is in trouble, \" she says.",

This is up from 41 % a year ago and is the highest gallup has recorded since 1993, albeit marginally above the 44 % and 45 % highs seen during that period. The new result comes from gallup's oct. 6-9 crime poll, which also finds public support for personal gun rights at a high-water mark. Given this, the latest increase in self-reported gun ownership could reflect a change in americans ' comfort with publicly stating that they have a gun as much as it reflects a real uptick in gun ownership. Republicans ( including independents who lean republican ) are more likely than democrats ( including democratic leaners ) to say they have a gun in their household: 55 % to 40 %. While sizable, this partisan gap is narrower than that seen in recent years, as democrats'self-reported gun ownership spiked to 40 % this year. The percentage of women who report household gun ownership is also at a new high, now registering 43 %.

Workers who do pull a paycheck take home between $ 120 and $ 150 a month, while their bosses \" pay significantly higher amounts \" to pyongyang, per darusman's report. Most of the workers are sent to mining, construction, logging, and textile jobs in china and russia, with others scattered throughout africa, europe, asia, and the middle east, the ap notes. The forced-labor issue is part of north korea's overall strategy for keeping its people in check, darusman says, adding he'd like the un security council to seek justice in the international criminal court.

        "summary": "The white house has responded to james comey's blockbuster testimony in the form of a statement from president trump's lawyer, marc kasowitz, usa today reports. The statement essentially accuses the former fbi director of lying during key points of his testimony. Kasowitz says trump \" never in form or substance \" asked comey to stop investigating anyone or demanded a loyalty oath from him. Kasowitz went on to attack comey for leaking memos of his meetings with trump to the media. Here's what else you need to know about comey's thursday testimony to congress: media outlets rushed to put out what they believe are the key takeaways from comey's testimony, which the washington post deemed \" newsworthy, \" highlighting in particular that comey believes trump is a liar. Meanwhile, the wall street journal's highlights include comey admitting to leaking memos of his meetings with trump and his statement that the white house \" chose to defame me. \" key moments named by abc news include comey saying he was fired to \" change \" the russia investigation and declining to answer \" in an open setting \" whether he believed trump colluded with russia. The three most-tweeted moments of comey's testimony, according to twitter, were john mccain's questioning, comey's \" lordy, i hope there are tapes, \" and comey asserting russia definitely interfered in the election. Mccain's line of hard-to-follow questioning — he referred to \" president comey \" at one point — had fellow senators, comey, and the public \" perplexed, \" time reports. John legend summed up twitter's feelings, asking, \" is mccain ok? \" the senator later released a statement saying he \" shouldn't stay up late watching \" baseball. Cnn rounds up the winners and losers, including comey ( winner ) and trump ( loser ). Others who came out on one side or the other: jeff sessions, loretta lynch, the new york times, and one-time archbishop of canterbury thomas becket. Republican national committee chair ronna romney mcdaniel says comey came across as arrogant in his testimony, which \" was simply a last ditch attempt to save face with the american people, \" the hill reports. Finally, cnbc states nothing in comey's testimony was enough to get trump impeached or even to discredit him politically. But the testimony will have one lasting impact: \" it will foster more partisan bitterness and more bad feelings about our political process and news media. \"",

Thomas kim, a resident of the 11-story building, is jailed on suspicion of murder, attempted murder, and arson. Police say he killed veteran fire capt. Dave rosa, 45, and wounded 35-year-old firefighter ernesto torres, who was expected to make a full recovery. A resident of the home also was shot and is in critical condition. \"we're frustrated that there's a large puzzle we're trying to put together, and a lot of information we don't know yet, \" says police chief robert luna. Police have not speculated about a motive, and kim \" hasn't given us much of an explanation, \" says another police official, per the los angeles times. Firefighters arrived at covenant manor about 4am monday after getting a report about an explosion, reports the ap. They discovered blown-out windows on the second floor and extinguished a fire, and were searching the building when gunfire broke out. Authorities later recovered a revolver from the scene, and found two suspicious devices in kim's apartment as well as what is believed to be gasoline. An ambush? \" that is definitely on the table, \" says luna. \" these brave firefighters went through those doors and, unfortunately, they were met with gunfire. \"",

In a letter to lawyers in 1968, the lennons ' housekeeper, dorothy jarlett, described how the atmosphere in the house became increasingly tense beginning in the summer of 1967 as lennon's marriage to first wife cynthia broke down, the daily mail reports. The housekeeper says the couple would often argue about the upbringing of their son, julian, who was born in 1963. Lennon's approach to fatherhood tended to be apathetic, she says, but he would sometimes smack the boy if he misbehaved and would become enraged by julian's table manners, which she describes as \" better than average. \" she says that cynthia was \" often depressed and­ ­unhappy \" and lennon appeared to lose interest in taking her out in public. As things deteriorated, \" i began noticing drugs lying around in various parts of the house. It was quite clear to me that mr. Lennon was smoking pot, and we all hoped that it was a phase, \" jarlett writes, but pot isn't all she found lying around: she says she once found lennon in bed with yoko ono while cynthia was away. The pair were divorced after lennon got drunk in early 1968 and told cynthia he had been sleeping with other women. The letter was found among the former housekeeper's belongings after she died last year and is expected to fetch $ 10,000 at auction, reports the new york daily news.

The claims were made in a five-page document written by lawyers in 1968 acting for lennon's first wife, cynthia, as the marriage broke down, reports the times of london. The statement, made to a london law firm, was taken from the lennons ' housekeeper dorothy jarlett. The letter was found among mrs. Jarlett's possessions after she died last year and is now among items being auctioned. In it, jarlett describes how she found lennon in bed with yoko ono while cynthia was out of the country. It also reveals that lennon used to smack his son julian if he misbehaved. Mrs. Jarlett wrote: \" until about the summer ( of ) 1967 i thought the house was reasonably happy … from about a year ago, mr. Lennon did not seem as keen as before to take mrs. Lennon out with him to various functions, studio recordings etc. \" the housekeeper, dorothy jarlett, stated that the 'atmosphere ' of the lennon house changed after 1967, and that she found him in bed with yoko ono while he was still married to cynthia, whom he divorced in 1968.

            "A never-before-seen dossier detailing the bitter breakdown of john lennon's marriage to his first wife cynthia has been uncovered after nearly 50 years. The five-page document, drafted by the solicitors dealing with the beatle's divorce in 1968, reveals details of his increasing drug use and his affair with yoko ono.

            "An unflattering portrait of john lennon as a cheating husband and a drug abuser has emerged, according to long-ago legal documents that have just surfaced in the uk. The claims were made in a five-page document written by lawyers in 1968 acting for lennon's first wife, cynthia, as the marriage broke down, reports the times of london. The statement, made to a london law firm, was taken from the lennons ' housekeeper dorothy jarlett. The letter was found among mrs. Jarlett's possessions after she died last year and is now among items being auctioned. In it, jarlett describes how she found lennon in bed with yoko ono while cynthia was out of the country. It also reveals that lennon used to smack his son julian if he misbehaved. Mrs. Jarlett wrote: \" until about the summer ( of ) 1967 i thought the house was reasonably happy … from about a year ago, mr. Lennon did not seem as keen as before to take mrs. Lennon out with him to various functions, studio recordings etc. \" the housekeeper, dorothy jarlett, stated that the 'atmosphere ' of the lennon house changed after 1967, and that she found him in bed with yoko ono while he was still married to cynthia, whom he divorced in 1968.

        "summary": "Reading tweetstorms is about to become a whole lot easier. Coming off the heels of the controversial decision to expand its character limit, twitter announced tuesday that it will be rolling out a threads feature over the next few weeks. Threads, which the company describes as \"stitching tweets together to share more information or tell a longer story, \" are notoriously clunky to post and read. Add in a few replies from readers, and you've got what wired senior staff writer david pierce describes as \"a mess. \" he writes, \"unlike moments, live video, and the algorithmic timeline, threads are something users want to do, \" noting that creating this functionality is twitter's return to a \"product changing to suit the way people want to use it. \" users began posting threads as a workaround for expressing longer chains of thought ( or rants ) for some time. According to the verge, the first threads began popping up in 2014 when twitter started linking replies to tweets. Twitter claims the platform sees \"hundreds of thousands of threads \" daily. To create a thread using twitter's new function, users simply click a plus button that appears in the composer window, reports techcrunch. For readers, long threads will be truncated in timelines with the option to expand. Even with twitter's expanded character count, users won't be able to write a novel using this new feature — threads will be cut off after 25 entries.

Kprc reports valerie jackson had filed protective orders against both conley and her husband. The state started investigating the family in 2011 because of allegations conley was abusing valerie jackson, according to the chronicle. In 2012, dwayne jackson was accused of threatening to kill his wife and their children, valerie jackson was accused of neglectful supervision, and one of the children claimed they were left alone and \" whooped \" often. The following year, valerie jackson reported conley chasing her with a knife, and her 7-year-old boy was found wandering alone in the streets. Kprc reports there were also allegations of conley slamming valerie's head in a fridge and dwayne jackson holding her hostage in a hotel room for a week. When the judge ordered the state to cease its intervention, she cited the cooperation of the children's parents.",

        "summary": "Depression might be known more as a women's disease, but new research shows men suffer just as much — only differently. When rage, risk-taking, and substance abuse are taken into account, men are just as likely to be diagnosed with depression as women, the study says. In fact, if nontraditional symptoms are properly identified, men may actually be more likely to suffer from major depression, the los angeles times reports, adding it's news that may help explain why men are four times more likely to commit suicide. Researchers created two checklists — one gender-neutral, and one for how males react to the disease — to see if men could be diagnosed more accurately. After analyzing 5,700 adults for behaviors like anger attacks and irritability, about 30 % of men and women were found to have experienced depression at some point, while 26 % of men and 22 % of women battled major depression. \" we have not been asking about and taking into account a range of symptoms that may be gender-specific, \" said one expert, while the study lead told usa today, \" if we can get men who have depression to recognize it in themselves and get treatment, that is really significant. \"",

This online subculture got some media attention after a reporter stumbled on it in ebay's \" everything else \" section, npr reports. \" there was an advert for something which was a sadistic, perverted, haunted doll, \" says the reporter, jak hutchcraft, who covered it on vice.com. \" it was this little, menacing-looking sort of troll. \" it also sold for over $ 1,400. So he talked to a couple of women who sell items on the pricey possessed-toys market, and found them surprisingly down to earth. They said people buy the dolls for help with white or black magic, or to adopt orphan spirits supposedly living in the dolls. Some buyers \" are interested because they don't have children of their own, \" says one of the women, jayne harris. \" they ask if i've come across any spirited children that are in limbo. \" the other, nancy oyola, says her buyers are satisfied and usually confirm that the dolls are haunted. According to hutchcraft, the market blossomed after a wine cabinet supposedly haunted by a \" dybbuk \" ( from jewish mythology ) sold on ebay in 2004. Now there's a witchcraft section on etsy, vice.com reports, and ebay has a guide to buying haunted items. But a man billed as a parapsychic medium isn't convinced: \" i can't see how this mass production of haunted dolls is feasible, \" he says. \" we don't get to choose where a spirit will reside or what it's attached to. \" ( ebay also sold rob ford's \" crack tie \"...

But this is a heart issue, \" he said on fox news. \" laws don't change this kind of thing. \" he added: \" we ask why there's violence in our schools, but we've systematically removed god from our schools. Should we be so surprised that schools would become a place of carnage? \" more at the huffington post.

            "Arizona is the latest state to confirm cases of the deadly porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, a highly contagious pig disease, increasing the tally of u.s. States with confirmed cases to 27, a group of animal health researchers said. Virginia has reported positive samples of the virus in the environment, but not yet in a hog herd, according to data released on thursday by the u.s. Department of agriculture's national animal health laboratory network. Confirmed cases of pedv increased by 274 in the week ending march 8, bringing the total number to 4,458 in 27 states. While one case can represent an individual animal or an entire herd at a single site, hog industry analysts estimate pedv has killed between 4 million and 5 million u.s. Hogs since it was discovered in may 2013. Pedv, which does not affect humans and is not a food safety risk, causes diarrhea, vomiting and severe dehydration in pigs. While older pigs have a chance of survival, 80 to 100 percent of piglets that contract it die. \" anytime we have a disease that cuts numbers, it cuts checkoff income, \" said john parker, spokesman for the virginia pork council, referring to the pork checkoff which funds research, including disease research, and programs to promote the u.s.

Irish researchers have classified a new organ in the human body while proving \" the anatomic description that had been laid down over 100 years of anatomy was incorrect, \" according to a press release. The mesentery — which attaches the intestine to the abdomen — is the 79th organ in the human body, inverse reports. According to science alert, the mesentery was described way back when by leonardo da vinci, but scientists have long believed it was a series of multiple structures, and therefore not an organ. But new examinations of it on a microscopic level show that it is in fact one self-contained structure, meeting the definition of an organ, the irish examiner reports. Researchers now hope to figure out exactly how the mesentery works, which could lead to better treatment for digestive and abdominal diseases. \" the next step is the function, \" lead researcher j. Calvin coffey says. \" if you understand the function you can identify abnormal function, and then you have disease. \" coffey says the classification of the mesentery as an organ leads to a \" whole new area of science. \" but while the famous medical textbook gray's anatomy has already been updated, coffey tells discovery news he doesn't know \" who the final arbiter \" is when it comes to officially designating organs. \" the mesentery should be subjected to the same investigatory focus that is applied to other organs and systems, \" researchers conclude in their study, published in november in the lancet gastroenterology &amp; hepatology.

For centuries, anatomists believed they were connected via an inconsequential, fragmented series of tissues, but, as scientists report in the lancet: gastroenterology and hepatology, they're anchored by the mesentery, a fold of tissue that is finally being recognized as what it truly is: an organ. It isn't easy to get into the organ club: scientists withhold that status for those parts of the body that are not only self-contained but also provide some vital function to the body. Because research on the mesentery over the past 100 years suggested that it was made up of several pieces rather than one, continuous band of tissue locking the intestines in place, it was mostly disregarded.

A duke university-led team of researchers collected sediment and water samples from a creek in western pennsylvania where treated fracking wastewater is discharged.

They set off with a tent, compass, gps, maps, and a single canadian-made paddle purchased in germany, expecting to reach the town in four or five days. But wet terrain meant they at first traveled less than 4 miles in eight hours. As they munched on limited toast and canned soup over the next few days — their wet shoes twice becoming coated in ice at night — the men reminded each other how good their next pizza would taste. \" but deep in myself i sometimes thought we are not going to make it, \" says wagner, 25. \" i think maybe it was the same with [ hoentsch, 26 ]. \" when they finally reached a highway on aug. 6 having lost about 22 pounds each, \" we were so happy, \" he adds.

However, ebay is a different matter. Klein had also asked that site to pull ads for the drinks, but ebay has not responded, he said. A search for four loko, conducted by the daily news tuesday, yielded at least one hit for an unopened can of the product.

            "Three mahwah, nj women were arrested after they allegedly tried to sell cases of four loko to undercover cops. Police say detectives, posing as college students, responded to an advertisement on craigslist and set up a meeting to buy three cases of four loko for $ 335. The three women, all in their 20s, were charged with selling an alcoholic beverage without a state license. Four loko was banned in new york last november, which quickly resulted in a black market on craigslist, where the caffeine-infused alcoholic beverage is sold for as much as $ 8 a can. The drink was outlawed in new york state because of its caffeine and high alcohol content. Each can has about as much caffeine as a cup of coffee and as much alcohol as six beers.

In fact, according to data from the us consumer product safety commission, some of the most common serious injuries that er staff witness each year are the result of people using exercise equipment, including treadmills, per usa today. In 2012, nearly 460,000 people went to the hospital for exercise equipment-related injuries, and though most were treated and released, 32,000 of those people were either hospitalized or were dead on arrival. The numbers for the treadmill in particular have been high for a while: according to a 2011 cbs news report, some 19,000 people went to the er in 2009 for treadmill injuries, including 6,000 or so kids. One of those kids who received media attention was mike tyson's 4-year-old daughter, exodus, who died in 2009 after getting tangled in a treadmill cord. Quartz notes the bruises, broken bones, and worse that can result from treadmill accidents, and it cites a 2012 study that calls pediatric injuries from these machines an \" emerging problem \" that presents a \" significant danger \" to children. It's worrisome enough in australia that there's now a campaign targeted to warning how risky treadmills are for young kids, the bbc notes. But although it's understandable to see how kids can use the machines incorrectly, how do we explain so many adult injuries? michael miller speculates in the washington post the rise in exercise equipment injuries could be partly attributed to more powerful equipment, as well as more distracting devices like smartphones.

        "summary": "An uber driver in new york could get up to life in prison for the nightmarish ride he gave a woman earlier this year. Federal prosecutors say harbir parmar picked the woman up the night of feb. 21 to drive her from manhattan to her home in white plains, about an hour away. But when she fell asleep, prosecutors say, parmar changed the destination to boston. The woman told investigators that she woke up to find \" his hand under her shirt touching the top of her breast, \" the ap reports. She said she reached for her phone, but he took it and began driving again. He refused to take her to a police station and eventually left her by the side of an interstate in connecticut. She later found her credit card had been charged $ 1,047 for a trip to massachusetts. Authorities say parmar also charged cleaning fees, falsely claiming the woman had vomited in his vehicle — something he had done with at least two other passengers. He is also accused of overcharging riders on at least 11 occasions by entering false information on their destinations. Parmar, 24, was charged tuesday with kidnapping, which carries a potential life sentence, and wire fraud, the new york times reports. \" no one — man or woman — should fear such an attack when they simply hire a car service, \" said us attorney geoffrey s. Berman. Uber says it is fully cooperating with the investigation of the alleged \" horrible incident. \" authorities say the case shows the need for stronger background checks of drivers.

The woman reached for her cellphone to call for help, but the driver grabbed it from her. He eventually left her on the side of interstate 95 near new haven, prosecutors said. Her credit card was later charged $ 1,047.55 for a trip to massachusetts. The driver, harbir parmar, 24, of howard beach, queens, was arrested tuesday and charged with kidnapping and wire fraud, the government said. If convicted of the kidnapping charge, he could face life in prison. ( mr. Parmar did not face a charge related to the alleged touching. )"

Two new estimates suggest the tiangong-1 space lab will fall from space in an uncontrolled re-entry in late march or early april. According to a \" highly variable \" estimate put forth tuesday, the european space agency predicts the 9-ton craft will fall between march 29 and april 9. That's on course with the prediction of nonprofit aerospace, which foresees a re-entry in the first week of april, give or take a week. The space lab, which can be tracked here, dropped below 185 miles in altitude in october. It's currently hovering around 160 miles in altitude, but dropping a little less than 4 miles per week, up from about 1 mile per week in october, harvard astrophysicist jonathan mcdowell tells the guardian. The craft is expected to burn up in the atmosphere between the 43º north and 43º south lines of latitude, which include parts of the us, portugal, spain, italy, the middle east, and china in the north and parts of chile, argentina, australia, and new zealand in the south, per popular mechanics. Should some debris make it to land, it could cover a wide area, but it's highly unlikely to cause injuries. Even in the aforementioned areas, the chance of being hit by debris is \" about one million times smaller than the odds of winning the powerball jackpot, \" aerospace notes, adding that \" in the history of spaceflight no known person has ever been harmed by reentering space debris. \" the nonprofit points out another concern, however: the space lab might be carrying a highly toxic and corrosive fuel.",

So reports a sociologist who since 2008 has been studying 15 men in a support group affiliated with a mega-church in the southwest, 14 of whom have since gotten married, reports livescience. While the men had talked freely about sex and sexual urges prior to marriage — including masturbation, pornography, and same-sex attractions — they said they shouldn't discuss sex after marriage because they'd be talking about their wives instead of just themselves. Secular sociologist sarah diefendorf tells new republic that the men would refrain from giving in to their \" beastly \" urges via accountability partners and \" are you behaving? \" evening text messages, but that once they married they no longer had a support group with which to discuss sex. Many confessed to her that they were struggling with extramarital desires, pornography, masturbation, and lingering conflicting feelings about the sanctity of sex. \" when you spend the first twenty-plus years of your life thinking of sex as something beastly that needs to be controlled, it's very difficult to make that transition to married life and viewing sex as sacred, \" she says. ( meanwhile, the vast majority of teen girls have no formal sex ed prior to becoming sexually active. )",

            "Ar: are there similar support groups for abstinent women in the church? sd: not that i found. The church, and the men that i interviewed, don't believe that women would need a space to talk through these issues. They believe that men are highly sexual beings and they have \" natural urges \" that need to be controlled, but they don't believe that women have that natural desire to be sexually active. Women are the providers of sexual activity for their husbands. One of the men shared a revealing story. He was dating a woman from outside the church and she wanted to have sex with him. I asked him why they broke up, and he said that was the main reason. Not only did having premarital sex go against his beliefs — for him, it also indicated that she was in love with him, and he wasn't yet in love with her. It couldn't be that she just wanted to have sex with her boyfriend. Ar: you write that these men are \"transgressing normative understandings of gender that equate performances of masculinity with sexual activity. \" how do they reconcile their masculine identity with abstinence? sd: for these men, to be a good man and a man of god meant saving themselves for the wedding bed.

Although current reporting rules allow twitter to inform the public about requests in \" broad \" terms, twitter wants to assure its users on the privacy front by being able to give exact numbers and show the \" limited scope \" of surveillance on its service. Part of the problem lies in an agreement the government reached in january with five other tech behemoths — google, facebook, linkedin, microsoft, and yahoo — that twitter doesn't think it has to completely adhere to, since it doesn't receive the large number of requests those other companies do ( and most twitter posts are public anyway, the post notes ).

But apple doesn't pony up for such detective work, which is why security experts say they're not shocked an outside party — reuters notes an israeli paper has pointed to israeli forensic software firm cellebrite — has gone to the fbi claiming to know how to hack the iphone of san bernardino shooter syed farook, the new york times reports. Instead of paying hackers, apple at most offers online kudos — an approach some say needs to change. \" especially with the stakes being as high as they are, if apple wants to continue to compete in the modern world, they have to modernize their approach, \" says an official at a company that runs bounty programs. Apple has shied away from what the times calls a \" financial arms race, \" instead relying on inside testing and its own security team to find bugs. Who is willing to shell out cash for insight into apple design flaws: what the times calls an \" underground ecosystem of brokers and contractors \" motivated to uncover apple flaws to basically cash a \" blank check \" with the government in cases like san bernardino. In fact, some security insiders say it's too late for apple to make up lost ground with bug bounties. \" it's never going to be able to compete with what is going on behind the scenes in the black market, \" a co-founder of one hacker-friendly company says. Meanwhile, former apple ceo john sculley tells cnbc he thinks that current ceo tim cook \" has done an exemplary job of leadership, \" and that the fbi going with a third party to bust apple's encryption would be \" fair. \" ( cbs news documents different options the fbi might be looking at to crack the code. )",
