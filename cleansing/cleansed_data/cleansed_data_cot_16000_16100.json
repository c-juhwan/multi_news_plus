But instead of car bingo and the alphabet game, they passed their time clearing the route with a pickaxe, gazing upon the aurora borealis, and spotting the occasional polar bear. The 2,485-mile journey from russian archipelago severnaya zemlya to resolute bay in canada's far north took 70 days at a speed of about 6.2mph — about farm-tractor speed, physorg reports. The team flew back to russia on thursday, leaving their vehicles in a garage; they ' ll be driven back to russia across the bering straight next february. Speaking of those vehicles, they're pretty bizarre: cbc describes them as \" amphibious trucks, \" while physorg calls them \" buses with bloated tires. \" they were able to carry the explorers over drifting ice floes and would have kept them afloat, had they fallen into the arctic ocean ( which they almost did at one point ). The expedition leader is planning to meet with investors who are interested in manufacturing them, which should perhaps concern canada: as next big future points out in its headline, \" russians have proven a land invasion of canada is feasible by driving over the north pole. \"",

The state's supreme court has ruled that a three-story home built in point judith in 2010 must be removed because it went up entirely on land owned by a public park, reports the providence journal. Engineers inexplicably skimped on the survey before building began, and the mistake didn't come to light until a prospective buyer had his own done. The survey showed that the mansion went up on land owned by the rose nulman park foundation instead of on the neighboring lot owned by the developer. The court said it was sympathetic to the developer's plight, but \" any attempt to build on even a portion of the property would constitute an irreparable injury, not only to plaintiff but to the public, \" reports ap. It's not clear yet whether the developer will try to move the structure or demolish it, reports nbc 10. \" errors are made by engineers, \" says a lawyer for the environmental advocacy group save the bay. \" some are more critical than others. \"",

        "summary": "Eric huang says he's \" good at vaccine development. \" the uc san diego dermatology professor tells the university's guardian he has even worked on a biodefense vaccine to fight anthrax, with a boost from the national institutes of health. Huang's latest development on the vaccine scene, however, may be of more interest to an even greater swath of people: he says a six-year study could lead to a vaccine that can fight the effects of propionibacterium acnes, the bacteria that causes acne. \" this is the first vaccine for human beauty, \" huang tells nbc 7, adding he sees a \" huge market \" for it. Huang told allure earlier this month that attempts to combat the skin condition have been challenging, as p. Acnes is found in everyone's skin; it can sometimes even be beneficial, per a 2013 study. Teens ' faces become p. Acnes magnets, since the oils they produce during this hormone-charged period are what feeds the bacteria. Researchers sussed out an antibody that affects only the toxic christie-atkins-munch-petersen protein secreted by the bacteria, instead of killing off the actual bacteria, changing the course of the vaccine's development.

The ag's office says manhattan restaurant per se, which charges $ 310 for its \" tasting menu, \" slapped a 20 % \" service charge \" on the bills of private-dining client customers and, in violation of state law, used that money for general operational costs instead of giving it directly to the servers, the new york daily news reports. The restaurant was also fined $ 100,000 and will be required to step up compliance with labor laws, reports the new york times. The settlement ensures that servers \" will not continue to be cheated out of their hard-earned tips — tips that customers intended for them, \" schneiderman said. In a statement to cnbc, the restaurant says the failure to pay the charge to servers was an oversight after state regulations on service charges changed in 2011. Per se says workers were \" never short-changed and no monies intended for employees were withheld, \" and the charge helped pay for \" industry-leading wages \" that average $ 116,000 a year for a waiter, including overtime and tips.

Sadly, this doesn't mean you ' ll be able to randomly appear anywhere in the world, but it's pretty cool regardless. Basically, the research will enable people to use quantum entanglement to send data across huge distances without the chance of someone listening in, which is \" how we ' ll form the unhackable communication networks of the future, \" per science alert. More of the impressive advances named by the mag: the battlefield mri ( bmri ) uses ultra-low-field magnetic resonance imaging to conjure up images of injured soft tissues, per phys.org. While \" hospital-based mri devices are big and expensive, \" the portable mri is \" a much lighter, less expensive, and low-power alternative that can be deployed to hard-to-reach places like the battlefield and remote hospitals in poor countries, \" a project leader says. The discovery of the massless weyl fermion by scientists from princeton, mit, and the chinese academy of sciences was also named. First proposed in 1929, weyl fermions were believed to make up other subatomic particles but evidence proved elusive. \" if applied to next-generation electronics, the fermions could allow for a nearly free and efficient flow of electricity and thus greater power, \" according to a release. Then there was the first team that measured light reflected from an exoplanet. Working from the la silla observatory, the experts were able to determine the mass, orbital inclination, and \" reflectivity \" of exoplanet 51 pegasi b, which was first discovered 20 years ago. The information can tell researchers about the makeup of the planet's surface and atmosphere. Check out the full list here.",

In one, subjects retained their normal heights; in the other, they were 10 inches shorter than their real-world height. The \" shorter \" scenario \" led to a striking consequence: people felt inferior and this caused them to feel overly mistrustful, \" says oxford university researcher daniel freeman. The virtual passengers were set up to behave in a \" strictly neutral fashion \" in both scenarios, freeman writes in the guardian. But in the shorter simulation, subjects ( who, \" short-man syndrome \" notwithstanding, were all women ) reported feeling as though others in their train car were staring at the them or having negative thoughts about them — and in most cases, participants didn't realize their height had been lowered, the telegraph reports. Freeman, who is 6 ' 2 \", acknowledges that \" this all happened in a virtual reality simulation, but we know that people behave in vr as they do in real life. \" still, he takes a positive message from the study: \" although we can't do much about our actual height, we can certainly learn to feel taller.

            "How tall are you? how tall would you like to be? and how tall do you tell other people you are? most of us – and especially men – tend to exaggerate our height, adding a centimetre or two when we think we can get away with it. This is understandable: ours is a culture that valorises the tall and belittles, as it were, the short. As a result, being tall brings with it a host of advantages. The taller you are, for instance, the more likely you are to go on to higher education. This is true even after controlling for cognitive ability, suggesting that some kind of subtle – indeed unconscious – bias may be operating among educators. Being tall is also associated with career success: in fact it has been estimated that a person who is six feet tall is likely to earn around £ 100,000 more over the course of a 30-year career than someone who is five foot four. And as if this weren't sufficient, being tall is likely to help in your romantic life too: altezza mezza bellezza, as the italians say – height is half of beauty. Thus taller adolescents of both sexes typically date more than their shorter peers, and tall men are more likely to find a long-term partner, or indeed several. ( it"

Matthew petersen is a lawyer on the federal election committee, but he has no trial experience, notes the washington post. That fact caught the attention of gop sen.

Has he ever tried a jury trial? \" i have not. \" civil, criminal, or bench? no, no, and no.

Sheldon whitehouse captioned with \" much watch \" and \" hoo-boy, \" per cbs news. The video shows a visibly uncomfortable petersen recounting three years spent at a washington law firm, which were followed by nine years at the fec. Petersen says he oversees the fec's litigation division but admits his background is \" not in litigation \" and \" the path that many successful district court judges have taken has been a different one than i have taken. \" in his defense, the american bar association rates petersen as \" qualified \" for the judge position.

        "summary": "The latest auto sales figures have triggered a flurry of negative headlines of the-boom-is-over variety. Sales fell 4.7 % in april, which is the fourth straight month of declines and the first time we've had such a streak since 2009, reports the ap. Barring an unexpected surge, the us is on track for a drop in annual sales — the end of a seven-year streak of increases. But given that last year's mark of 17.5 million was a record, there's also a widespread sentiment that a dip isn't that unusual and no cause for alarm. Related coverage: a post at bloomberg pins a good deal of the blame on chrysler's new pacifica minivan and the trend it represents. A top-of-the-line model will set you back about $ 50,000, and the story makes the case that sticker shock is finally taking a toll on families hunting for new wheels. A closer look at the numbers shows that they're actually great for detroit, argues matthew debord at business insider. The lack of growth isn't surprising given two years of records, and he writes that sales of trucks and suvs, where automakers make their real money, remain solid relative to low-margin sedans. \" as long as gas remains relatively cheap, credit is flowing, unemployment stays low, and wages continue to tick up without setting off inflation concerns, automakers are going to get fat and happy on their current vehicle mix. \" more specifically, so-called crossovers continue to do well. The trend is illustrated by the fact that toyota's rav4 outsold its ever-popular camry in april, notes the los angeles times. One notable outlier among automakers: subaru posted a 4 % sales increase, continuing its \" relentless hot streak, \" per the detroit free press. Hyundai and volkswagen also posted increases, though smaller. Jd power has specifics on each automaker, including bmw's 12 % decline. The new york times says the slowing sales have already led to layoffs and idled shifts at plants, calling into question president trump's reliance on the industry to add jobs. The story cites projections that sales will drop from 17.5 million last year to 17.2 million this year, then to 16.6 million in 2018 and 15.2 million in 2019.",

Father tony flannery, who has questioned the doctrine of celibacy, and said the priesthood should be opened up to women, has been told to stop writing about controversial subjects, and to spend the next six weeks in prayer and reflection at a monastery. His monthly column in a catholic magazine has been axed on orders from the vatican. Ireland's association of catholic priests — of which flannery is a founding member — slammed the vatican's intervention, calling it \" unfair, unwarranted, and unwise, \" the galway independent reports. The association accused the vatican of \" heresy hunting, \" and warned that the move to silence flannery only adds to a growing sense of disconnect between the church in ireland and officials in rome. Pope benedict xvi recently warned that the church will not tolerate priests who stray from doctrine, and harshly criticized dissident priests in austria.

        "summary": "In 1977, at a public forum about a series of rapes in northern california, a man expressed doubt that a serial rapist could assault a woman in front of her husband without him retaliating. Months later, the man's wife was raped while he was home. \" i can't positively say, but i think the rapist was in the meeting that night, \" a former detective tells the washington post. It was this penchant for \" psychological terror \" that kept paul holes hunting the golden state killer for almost 25 years. The investigator's victory came only months before his retirement. Holes used data points from the killer's dna, taken from the scene of a 1980 rape and murder, to find his great-great-great grandparents on gedmatch. From there, detectives spent four months tracing their lineage from the early 1800s, using police databases, census records, and obituaries. In the end, they had 25 family trees and a branch leading to a 72-year-old ex-cop living near sacramento. Joseph james deangelo jr. Is now suspected in 12 murders and at least 45 rapes, with more possible. Simi valley police chief david livingstone says the 1978 rape and murder of 24-year-old rhonda wicht, whose 4-year-old son was smothered in his bed, has \" similarities \" to the golden state killer's crimes. A woman also claims deangelo raped her in exeter, where deangelo worked as a police officer, in 1973 or 1974 — years before the first crimes police attribute to him, per kxjz. \" i was struck by the lengths this predator would go to to instill fear in his victims, \" says another detective on the case. \" it was psychological terror. \"",

        "summary": "In 2016, test excavations at the site of a former catholic orphanage confirmed \" significant quantities of human remains \" were present in the old septic system of the catholic-run bon secours mother and baby home in tuam, ireland. The probe for such remains followed a bombshell 2014 report by a local historian that suggested some 796 children had died in the home for unwed mothers and babies over a nearly 40-year period beginning in 1925 but had no recorded burial place. The new york times reports the government was given options on how to proceed following the identification of the remains of babies and young children, from easier and cheaper courses like erecting a memorial to the onerous and expensive task of performing a forensic excavation of the entire area. The country on tuesday announced it has opted for the latter course. The times notes legislation will need to be passed before the exhumation can begin. The ap reports the underground sewage structure was found to be divided into 20 chambers, with the remains found within. Children's minister katherine zappone says she is \" committed to ensuring that all the children interred at this site can have a dignified and respectful burial, \" though the times notes the challenges ahead: the remains found during the test excavations were reportedly intermixed to a degree that identifying individuals prior to their reburial will be no small feat. The irish times reports the effort could cost as much as $ 15 million; the bon secours sisters have pledged to pay about $ 3 million of that. The bbc notes the home itself had previously been razed.

That's according to a new study published in the journal of family psychology in which researchers looked at 50 years of prior research on nearly 161,000 children. \" the upshot of the study is that spanking increases the likelihood of a wide variety of undesired outcomes for children, \" the study's coauthor says in a press release. \" spanking thus does the opposite of what parents usually want it to do. \" those undesired outcomes are the same ones seen with child abuse, including cognitive difficulties and antisocial behavior. \" we as a society think of spanking and physical abuse as distinct behaviors, \" says one researcher. But \" spanking is linked with the same negative child outcomes as abuse, just to a slightly lesser degree. \" still, the practice appears to be widespread. A survey in 2002 showed nearly 80 % of us preschoolers were spanked, mic reports, a stat consistent with international numbers from unicef in 2014. And, according to nbc news, a 2013 poll found 81 % of americans think spanking — \" technically legal \" in all 50 states — is \" sometimes appropriate. \" researchers argue that spanking continues not because it's effective but because children who are spanked grow up to become parents who spank.

Here's a snapshot of the situation: at home: corporal punishment is technically legal in all 50 states. Statutes vary from state to state but generally say that the physical punishment must be reasonable or not excessive, although delaware passed a law in 2012 that said it couldn't cause any injury or pain. Proposed legislative bans in several states have failed to pass, and courts have generally upheld parents ' right to spank.

The figure highlights the company's newly aggressive stance against malicious or suspicious accounts in the wake of russian disinformation efforts during the 2016 us presidential campaign. Last week, twitter confirmed a washington post report that it had suspended 70 million accounts in may and june. The cavalcade of suspensions has raised questions as to whether the crackdown could affect twitter's user growth and whether the company should have warned investors earlier. The new figure sheds light on twitter's attempt to improve \" information quality \" on its service, its term for countering fake accounts, bots, disinformation, and other malicious occurrences. Such activity was rampant on twitter and other social-media networks during the 2016 campaign, much of it originating with the internet research agency, a since-shuttered russian \" troll farm \" implicated in election-disruption efforts by the us special counsel and congressional investigations. Twitter declined to comment on the data.

And since even the vikings were scared of norway's famously temperamental body of water, it's not surprising to hear that the country has been working on a way to circumvent it. Its solution: the world's first ship tunnel designed for both cargo and passenger ships drilled right through a mountain range, nbc news reports. The $ 315 million, 1-mile-long tunnel, whose construction is expected to start in 2019 and last three or four years, will be blasted through the rocks of the stadlandet peninsula. \" we are pleased that the ship tunnel will now become a reality, \" says ketil solvik-olsen, norway's transport minister, per the guardian. A press release from the norwegian coastal administration lays out the tunnel's specifics: mainly, that it will be about 120 feet wide and nearly 160 feet high and able to accommodate ships up to about 17,600 tons. Almost 9 million tons of rock will need to be decimated to make the tunnel happen. And its necessity is no exaggeration: the stadhavet sea is notorious for turbulent weather with high winds, strong currents, and waves that often don't die down for days after a storm. Solvik-olsen notes that in addition to making travel less risky, travel times between certain points will also be reduced. And if ships are coming into the tunnel from either end, there's a plan for that, too: traffic lights will ensure safe passage, the nca says, per cnn.

Lawrence lacks said that he is the executor of his mother's estate and that an agreement the national institutes of health made with other family members over the years regarding use of the cells were not valid. That agreement did not include compensation. The cells collected from the 31-year-old turners station woman during a diagnostic procedure before she died of an aggressive form of cervical cancer in 1951 were the first to live outside the body in a glass tube. They were dubbed the hela cells and have become the most widely used human cells that exist today in scientific research. Vaccines, cancer treatments and in vitro fertilization are among the many medical techniques derived from her cells. \" my mother would be so proud that her cells saved lives, \" lawrence lacks said in a statement. \" she'd be horrified that johns hopkins profited while her family to this day has no rights. \" johns hopkins officials said in a statement that when the cells were taken there was no established practice for informing or obtaining consent from cell or tissue donors, nor were there any regulations on the use of cells in research. \" today, johns hopkins and",

Because, in the years since her death, lacks's cells – taken from her tumour while she was undergoing surgery – have been responsible for some of the most important medical advances of all time. The polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping and ivf: all these health milestones, and many more, owe everything to the life, and death, of a young mother. Lacks's cells – known as hela, using the first two letters of each of her names – became the first immortal human cell line in history. Scientists at the hospital where she died, johns hopkins in baltimore, had been working for years to try to start a continuously reproducing cell line – but the cells always died. Lacks's were the first that \" took \", introducing a constantly reproducing line of cells that are literally, to give them their scientific definition, immortal.

Instead, she drugged 8-year-old jude mirra to death with ambien and xanax in 2010, leading solomon to sentence her to 18 years in prison, the ap reports. Jordan had argued that jude's death was a mercy killing to keep him away from his biological father, who she said had sexually abused jude, and that she had also planned to kill herself. Solomon didn't buy that story, claiming her reports of abuse weren't credible. He apparently believed prosecutors, who asserted that jordan simply couldn't handle the special needs of her son. \" all of her money, all of her resources, she decided to kill him, \" solomon said during the sentencing. During her trial last fall, jordan said that she was trying to save jude from sexual abuse at the hands of her second husband, emil tzekov, because she believed her first husband, ray mirra, was trying to kill her and take all her money — which might have left jude in tzekov's custody, the washington post reports. And the alleged murder-suicide plan was actually jude's idea, she claimed. \" i need to be dead. I need a lot of drugs to die peacefully. That's all, \" is what she testified jude had written to her, per the new york times. She says her nonverbal son typed messages to her on his electronic devices and had told her about the abuse he suffered — not only sexual abuse, but also being forced to drink blood and kill animals, cbs new york reports. \" i died the night jude died, \" she told cbs in an october jailhouse interview from rikers island.

        "summary": "Detectives are using a new forensic tool to chase down murderers: dna data mining, reports the new york times. This week, snohomish county police announced the arrest of william earl talbott, 55, in the 1987 murders of canadians jay cook, 20, and tanya van cuylenborg, 18. The washington investigators used a process similar to the one used to crack the notorious golden state killer case, uploading dna taken from the crime scene to gedmatch, a public genealogy site. The suspect's dna profile led them to family members of the suspect who had shared their dna information on the site. Based on the suspect's dna profile, a genetic genealogist was able to create an extensive family tree using information from the site, as well as other publicly available and social media sites. Once the detectives had their suspect, they still needed to get an exact match to his dna, so they followed him and eventually collected a cup he had used. Gedmatch users have mixed feelings about investigators mining the site for clues. Some view it as a violation of privacy. \" this is really tough, \" an ethicist told the times about the golden state killer case. \" he was a horrible man and it is good that he was identified, but does the end justify the means? \" but others applaud the results. For lee cook, the mother of jay cook, the value is clear, while the loss never diminishes. \" jay … would be 51 now, \" she says. \" he probably would have married and had kids. I would have more grandchildren. I miss all that could have been. \" ( police are also hoping that a genetic match will lead them to the zodiac killer. )",

        "summary": "Painting outdoors allowed vincent van gogh a firsthand look at the landscapes that would become the subjects of his masterpieces. But the routine wasn't without, well, pests. As part of a study of 104 paintings from france, conservator mary schafer at kansas city's nelson-atkins museum of art recently took a microscope to van gogh's 1889 masterpiece \" olive trees \" and discovered a tiny secret hidden in the oil paint: a very real, very dead grasshopper, reports the kansas city star. Too small to be noticed by the naked eye, it had been overlooked for 128 years, museum rep kathleen leighton tells hyperallergic. Van gogh himself might even have missed it, though the insect's presence in the painting wouldn't have surprised him. Van gogh was a \" plein-air \" artist known to work outdoors and once complained to his brother about the bugs that would infect his work, reports artnet news. \" i must have picked up a good hundred flies and more off the four canvases that you ' ll be getting, not to mention dust and sand, \" the dutch painter wrote in a letter. Other plein-air artists suffered similarly. As the toronto star reported earlier this year, black flies are often found in paintings by early 20th-century canadian artist tom thomson. As van gogh's grasshopper was missing its thorax and abdomen and appeared not to have struggled, it was probably dead when it hit the paint, leighton tells hyperallergic. The bug will remain in place in the lower foreground of the painting. ( his brother is linked to the loss of van gogh's ear. )",

After all, van gogh is one of the world's best known plein airs artists, and his famous landscapes were painted within the very fields and gardens that were his subject matter. The microscopic insect cannot be seen with the naked eye, and so it remained unnoticed for over a century.

Michael s. Engel, senior curator and professor at the university of kansas and associate at the american museum of natural history in new york, but unfortunately the grasshopper's body could not confirm precise dating.

A datacenter collects, processes, and stores large amounts of data, and microsoft's underwater center will perform the same functions as a traditional center but in a submarine-like capsule. It will be unmanned, so if something fails onboard, it cannot be repaired. An undersea cable attached to the capsule will deliver the data to the wider internet. The idea behind placing the center underwater is that datacenters use a huge amount of electricity, run very hot, and require massive amounts of cooling — and the seawater provides instant cooling. In addition, the center plans to capture energy generated by the movement of waves. According to microsoft, the center, which will be deployed for five years, is 40 feet long and is loaded with 12 racks containing 864 servers and 27.6 petabytes of storage — enough to store five million movies. One consultant is concerned about the potential environmental impact. \" you just end up with a warmer sea and bigger fish, \" he tells the bbc.

And an arm for a shoe? the nypd says a 17-year-old in brooklyn who stole a pair of air jordans at gunpoint lost an arm when the victim ran over the teenager and pinned him against a fence, pix11 reports. The teen, identified as zachary sam, allegedly used craigslist to arrange to meet 39-year-old philip pierre to buy the $ 190 sneakers, but instead pulled a gun when he got in pierre's suv. \" he put the gun to his head and told him he would shoot him, that he will not make it home to his family, \" a relative tells nbc 4. Sam strolled off with the sneakers, but surveillance video shows he only made it 100 yards before pierre did a u-turn and ran him down, police say. According to pix11, sam tried to get on a bus after his arm was severed but pierre pulled him off the vehicle in front of horrified passengers. The teen then ran around the corner to his home, where he collapsed. Pierre has been charged with attempted second-degree murder. A cousin tells abc7 that the hard-working father of three was only trying to detain the teen for police. \" i know what the video's showing — if somebody pulls a gun in your head, and you're trying to get the cops to catch him, what would you do? \" he says. \" you're telling me just let him go? \" sam's arm — and gun — were found at the scene.

More than 100 firefighters responded as the three-alarm blaze ripped through a three-story building. Among them, john mesh and larry leggio were killed when a brick wall collapsed. Two others were seriously injured. The kansas city star reports that the second arson count was over a 2013 fire set at a nail salon nguyen previously operated. She afterward collected $ 50,000 in insurance money, per kctv. In fact, prosecutors said each of five nail salons nguyen operated in texas and missouri since 2006 were closed after a fire or burglary, leading to four insurance payouts. Each was for more than the purchase price of the business, per the star. An auditor with the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives said nguyen received more than $ 250,000 in business and personal insurance payouts over a dozen years. After her arrest, nguyen — who faces up to 30 years in prison at her sept. 14 sentencing — reportedly admitted to a fellow inmate that she'd set the latest fire but didn't mean for anyone to die. \" we're very happy with the verdict, \" mesh's brother told reporters.

In that complaint, the woman alleges she and ford engaged in a verbal fight that soon turned violent and included ford pushing and grabbing her and placing her in a \" choke hold from behind \" until she \" couldn't breathe. \" she reported the alleged attack to police by phone on the 5th. Ford received the order at 3: 30pm, and walton said at a friday press conference, per the new york daily news, \" he was upset but nothing greater than anybody else that gets served a [ protection from abuse order ]. \" ford then left the factory; the first shots were reported at 4: 57pm.",

        "summary": "The new york times has a front-page story friday detailing how former fbi chief james comey tried to instruct president trump about the proper boundaries that should exist between them. The story, for example, says that trump called comey soon after taking office and wondered when word would go out that he was not personally under investigation. Comey then explained that all such questions must go through the proper lawyerly channels. One of the sources for the story, comey friend benjamin wittes, writes in a post at the lawfare blog, where he's editor in chief, that he wasn't aware of that particular phone call but isn't at all surprised. Wittes suggests that trump had a clear strategy: he tried to make comey a pal, keeping him \" on board only as long as it took him to figure out that there was no way to make comey part of the team. \" then he fired him. Wittes relays one incident in which comey was told he had an incoming call from the president and delayed a flight to take it, only to be stunned to learn that trump merely wanted to \" chit-chat. \" it made the fbi chief extremely uncomfortable. And he details their public greeting, seen in this video, saying that comey was \" disgusted \" that trump turned a perfunctory handshake into a \" one sided \" hug. \" he regarded the episode as a physical attempt to show closeness and warmth in a fashion calculated to compromise him before democrats who already mistrusted him. \" their fateful private dinner, in which trump allegedly asked comey for his loyalty, occurred less than a week later. The washington post has more details about that, saying that comey prepped aggressively with aides in advance to figure out the best way to fend off trump's expected questions.",

Comey, weeks after he took office and asked him when federal authorities were going to put out word that mr. Trump was not personally under investigation, according to two people briefed on the call. Mr. Comey told the president that if he wanted to know details about the bureau's investigations, he should not contact him directly but instead follow the proper procedures and have the white house counsel send any inquires to the justice department, according to those people. After explaining to mr. Trump how communications with the f.b.i. Should work, mr. Comey believed he had effectively drawn the line after a series of encounters he had with the president and other white house officials that he felt jeopardized the f.b.i.'s independence. At the time, mr. Comey was overseeing the investigation into links between mr. Trump's associates and russia. I did not know this particular fact, but it doesn't surprise me at all. The principal source for the rest of this story is, well, me — specifically a long interview i gave to reporter michael schmidt on friday about my conversations with fbi director james comey over the last few months, and particularly about one such conversation that took place on march 27 over lunch in comey's fbi office.

According to the national review, the post originally even quoted this line from the daily currant story, which may have been a hint to some that the story was fake: \" as you all know, i ' m not a big fan of newspapers, journalists, news anchors, and the liberal media in general. But i met with the folks at al-jazeera [ the daily currant spelled it ' al-jajizzraa ' ] and they told me they reach millions of devoutly religious people who don't watch cbs or cnn. That tells me they don't have a liberal bias. \" other hints parker missed: the daily currant quoted a supposed al jazeera exec named sheikh hamad bin thamer bin mohammed bin thani al-thani and a ny-based media analyst named elizabeth lemon. And there's more! it also quoted palin later referring to the network as \" al-jazimian \" and saying, \" alaska is located very close to the middle east, yet for some reason we don't have many arab tourists. \" the post has since corrected its story.",

        "summary": "A public health emergency was declared in flint, michigan, yesterday over the state of the city's drinking water — and a story in the detroit news illustrates just how bad the situation is. Ashley holt, 25, tells the paper that the water coming out of her faucet looks \" like urine, \" smells \" like the sewer, \" and doesn't taste \" normal \" — and it's been that way for nearly a year now. Last week, a group of doctors revealed that children in the city ( where 41.5 % of the population lives below the poverty line ) have elevated levels of lead in their blood, leading to the state of emergency and the county commissioners recommending people only use the water if it first goes through an approved filter; thousands of filters are being given to local families. On friday, gov. Rick snyder said it may reconnect flint to detroit's water system to deal with the problem, and that the state will also expedite a pipeline to lake huron to get water to flint, the news reports. Flint stopped paying detroit for its water service last year, citing the rising cost of the water service, and then complaints about the water quality started. Flint river is now used for the city's drinking water, and it seems the corrosive water is releasing lead from old pipes in homes, the ap reports. Residents have complained not just about the water's taste, smell, and appearance, but about rashes, hair loss, and other health concerns that may be related to its use; a general motors plant even stopped using the water because it rusted vehicle parts, the company said. Citizens, alongside national groups, petitioned the epa thursday to order michigan and its environmental officials to reconnect flint to detroit's water. As for holt, she says she struggles to afford bottled water for her kids, and other locals echo that. \" it's a complex with a whole lot of people and a whole lot of babies there, \" says one of her townhouse complex. \" these are people who probably can't afford to go and buy bottled water. So they get forced into drinking the ( tap ) water that's unhealthy. \"",

As quartz reports, advancements in technology have dropped that cost tremendously, to about $ 6,000 a pound. And hampton creek — a darling of silicon valley, a food company valued at $ 1 billion — wants in. It says it ' ll have a lab-grown meat product available next year, and if it succeeds, it ' ll be thanks in part to a dogged wwii pow. Quartz digs into the story of willem van eelen, born in 1923 in what was the dutch colony of indonesia; the guardian reports he spent five years starving in pow camps after being captured by the japanese while serving in the war. As the new yorker once quoted him as saying, \" i was so close to death that you could see my spine from the front. \" and daughter ira van eelen says that hunger left its mark. As a medical student in 1948, he saw researchers experimenting with stem cells in a quest to grow skin for burn victims. A light bulb went off. As he recounted the experience to his daughter: \" the only thing i saw was a piece of meat. \" what followed was a lifelong quest: filing for patents, making surprise visits to would-be investors in an effort to scrape together funding, and teaming up with others who he discovered also had patents related to lab-grown meat — including jon vein. The two launched a concerted effort to get financing and draw in more researchers, but van eelen died in 2015 without seeing his dream realized. Then, the call: hampton creek ceo josh tetrick phoned ira van eelen this summer, wanting her father's patents. As of september, it was a done deal. Read the full story at quartz.",

Pallenberg was perhaps best known for her connection to the rolling stones — she happily described herself as a hanger-on — for whom she served as a muse. According to the guardian, pallenberg got backstage at her first stones concert in 1965. She supplied guitarist brian jones with marijuana and hash and soon started a relationship with him. After jones reportedly physically abused her, pallenberg moved on to keith richards, with whom she would have three children prior to their split in 1980. Richards has said he was attracted to pallenberg's artistic sensibility and strength. \" i like a high-spirited woman, \" the hollywood reporter quotes from richards ' memoir. \" and with anita, you knew you were taking on a valkyrie — she who decides who dies in battle. \" pallenberg sang backing vocals on \" sympathy for the devil, \" and mick jagger is said to have remixed parts of beggars banquet on her input. She starred in the film performance with jagger in 1970 while denying the two were having an affair. She also memorably appeared as the black queen in barbarella.

It's true! super bowl li is a showdown between the new england patriots, who are seemingly here every other year and only lost two games this season, and the atlanta falcons, whose scorching offense has led them to their second super bowl appearance ever. Who's going to win? let's go to the experts: the new york times, pretty much an outlier here, gives the edge to atlanta, arguing that the patriots will score a bunch but don't have the defense to stop the falcons, who've scored at least 30 points in six straight games. Deadspin counters that it will, in fact, be the falcons who are doomed by their defense. It gets deep into stats and schemes, but here's one that seems important: atlanta is going against tom brady after a season in which it was one of the bottom four teams in the league against the pass. Meanwhile, the wall street journal gets scientific about it. A mathematical model developed by a university professor and vegas sports analyst gives the patriots a 65.2 % chance of winning. Sports illustrated also gives the edge to the patriots in a close game while identifying four players who could be key on sunday. The video game madden has predicted a 3-point patriot victory. And that's important because, as wired explains, the video game has correctly predicted the winner for nine of the past 13 super bowls, including getting the final score of super bowl xlix exactly right. In a video for sports illustrated, todd gurley, michael vick, and other current and former nfl players give their predictions. Finally, chris simms at bleacher report has all sorts of predictions for the big game, including how many receiving yards julio jones will rack up and whether brady will throw for more yards than matt ryan.",

Almost all of the 20 aides and groups subpoenaed have requested more time, and some of those requests have been granted, but the subpoenas should ultimately yield a trove of documents.

Hillary clinton and donald trump both insist they can win the state, the washington post reports, but if recent polls are correct, bernie sanders and ted cruz will be the ones to emerge with vital momentum from what will be the last primary until new york votes on april 19. In other coverage: cruz, trump, sanders, and bill clinton all descended on the milwaukee area monday night, while hillary clinton and john kasich campaigned in new york, the milwaukee journal sentinel reports. At his event, cruz was introduced by gov. Scott walker, who said the state could \" turn the tide for a cruz presidency. \" wisconsin isn't a winner-take-all state, but trump's path to the necessary 1,237 delegates will become a lot trickier if cruz wins by even one vote, according to fivethirtyeight's analysis. With 86 democratic delegates at stake, wisconsin could help sanders whittle away clinton's commanding lead, reports politico, which notes that the state is \" bernie-friendly \" because of both demographics and the fact that its primary is open to independent voters, who tend to pick sanders over clinton. The new york times reports that in an apparent effort to boost his abysmal ratings among women, trump's wife, melania, has joined him on the campaign trail. \" no matter who you are, a man or a woman, he treats everyone equal, \" she said at a monday night event in milwaukee that the times describes as \" subdued \" with \" a crowd that was less than capacity. \" in wisconsin, trump has faced a stronger anti-trump movement and a more cohesive gop establishment than in most other states, reports bloomberg, which notes that a loss there could undercut his claim to be the consensus candidate.",

Over 150 short-finned pilot whales were first spotted on the beach at hamelin bay by a fisherman on friday morning. By friday afternoon, all but 15 had died. According to the new york times, the number of survivors decreased to seven by friday night. \" i've never seen anything like it, seen so many whales beached like this, \" one tourist tells the ap. Over 100 volunteers, wildlife personnel, and others showed up to help, but their efforts to rescue the whales were hampered by bad weather and the danger of sharks showing up to feast on the carcasses. \" the conditions are challenging, but we are doing all we can to give these animals the best chance of survival, \" a member of the parks and wildlife service tells the times. Parks and wildlife service officers are taking dna samples as they remove the whale carcasses in an attempt to figure out why they were stranded. Short-finned pilot whales are prone to what scientists call \" mass strandings, \" though it's unclear why. Possible reasons include human activity, problems navigating, and illness. While whales regularly get stranded on hamelin beach as they migrate north from the antarctic waters where they feed, such mass strandings are unusual, reuters reports. A manager at hamelin bay holiday park says this is only the second mass stranding she's seen at hamelin bay in 15 years.

A judge today found michael brelo not guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the 2012 shootings that followed a massive police chase involving more than 100 cops, reports cleveland.com. Other officers fired at the couple in the fleeing car, but prosecutors singled out brelo because they say he hopped on the roof of the car after the shooting had stopped and fired through the windshield at timothy russell, 43, and malissa williams, 30. Each were hit more than 20 times in all. Defense attorneys maintained that brelo was justified in shooting because he believed that russell and williams had been firing at officers. The ap reports that russell's car backfired as it passed police headquarters, and the sound was mistaken for a gunshot, setting off the chase. The verdict comes ahead of a decision on whether city officers will face charges in the shooting death of 12-year-old tamir rice last year.

Kelly ayotte: \" i've been outraged by the fact that we haven't had a budget for three years because the senate democrats haven't wanted to do it.

While the president has, the republicans haven't. \" john mccain: \" shame on ray lahood. \" education secretary arne duncan: \" we don't have any ability with dumb cuts like this to figure out what the right thing to do is. It just means a lot more children will not get the services and opportunities they need, and as many as 40,000 teachers could lose their jobs. The fact that this is so easily avoidable is why i ' m so angry. \" bobby jindal: \"stop sending out your cabinet secretaries to scare the american people. \" michigan rep.

But this weekend, dear reader, the most terrifying urban legend of them all became something much, much worse: a real thing that happened to someone. Ever hear the one about the licking dog? no? oh god, how i envy you. Ok, via wikipedia: a young girl is home alone for the first time with only her dog for company. Listening to the radio, she hears of a serial killer ( or mental patient ) on the loose, so she locks all the doors and windows ( in some versions, the basement window is jammed open so she just locks the basement door ) and goes to bed, taking her dog to her room with her and letting it sleep under her bed. She wakes in the night and can hear a dripping sound coming from the bathroom. The dripping sound annoys her, and she actually finds it unsettling for some reason. The bedside lamp won't work, and she is too scared to get out of bed to turn on the main light and walk over to the bathroom. She hides under the covers but to reassure herself that the dog is still under the bed she puts her hand down and feels licking on her hand. She lies awake for some"

The team has dubbed it chactun ( meaning red or large rock ), and says it's one of the largest to be found in the yucatan's central lowlands. The numbers behind that claim: the 54-acre site would have once housed as many as 40,000 people, and evidence of 15 pyramids — one 75 feet tall — has been identified there. But the ruins don't end with those structures, livescience reports. The remains of plazas, homes, altars, inscribed stone slabs, and ball courts were found; the ball courts in particular indicate it was a prominent city, though one that met its end around 1000 ad, the team leader tells reuters. The search team first stumbled upon chactun by way of aerial photographs taken 15 years ago; hacking their way through 10 miles of jungle took three weeks. The archaeologists spent six weeks exploring its secrets, and hope the find will offer clues on relationships between maya cities — the closest known was 16 miles away.",

New health policies outlined on trump's website have dropped mentions of reining in drug prices and now include talk of modernizing medicare, notes the new york times. In a 60 minutes interview that will air sunday, trump said he would never get rid of obamacare before a replacement was ready, cnn reports. \" it will be just fine. That's what i do, i do a good job. You know, i know how to do this stuff, \" he said. The bbc notes that \" keeping obamacare's carrots while abandoning its sticks \" could be tricky, since the popular parts are made possible by the unpopular parts, like requiring all americans to have health insurance. In the journal interview, trump declined to say whether he still plans to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton. \" it's not something i've given a lot of thought, because i want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform, \" he said.

        "summary": "Amid a flurry of weddings expected to follow australia's legalization of same-sex marriage wednesday, there was also to be one divorce: back in june 2015, nick jensen wrote an editorial explaining he and his wife of 10 years would dissolve their marriage as a \" matter of conscience \" if the government approved same-sex marriage. A facebook event called \" celebrating nick and sarah jensen's divorce \" was created in response and attracted more than 183,000 attendees, the advocate reported at the time, but it seems the split will not come to pass. Continuing to argue that \" a redefinition of marriage changes the agreement under which we were originally married, \" jensen tells news.com.au his \" previous public comments regarding civil divorce never envisaged me separating from my wife, but rather our marriage from the state. \" but he says \" the legislation currently makes it untenable for us to do this under the law. \" jensen did not elaborate, and said he would make no other comment. He previously explained any divorce from his high school sweetheart and \" perfect match \" was to be in legal terms only and the couple would still consider themselves \" married by the church and before god. \" australian lawyer michael tiyce says he offered to help the couple navigate hurdles en route to their goal, including an initial one-year separation required under australian law. \" my firm does quite a bit of pro bono work in family law each year in the gay, lesbian and trans community. I thought offering assistance to nick and sarah would be an excellent way of reaching out across communities, \" he tells news.com.au, adding the couple did not accept his offer.",

The figure is much higher among younger generations — 36 % of people 18 to 29 and 28 % of those 30 to 49 — but offset by low figures among those 50 and up. Just 6 % of respondents over 65 said they rarely disconnect from the web, according to the survey conducted in june and july. Almost three-quarters of all respondents said they go online daily, including 42 % who do so \" several times a day. \" just one in 10 said they go online only about once a day, 13 % said they surf several times a week or less, and 13 % said they avoid the internet completely, per smithsonian and tech times. Usage was about the same among men and women. Pew didn't define what using the web \" almost constantly \" meant, but the verge notes going online could include streaming music or getting email push alerts, so a person probably isn't staring at a screen 24 hours a day. However, an earlier report focusing on mobile connections found 14 % of respondents used their smartphone's browser \" continuously. \" again, the phrase could be defined differently among respondents. A pew survey from april found 24 % of teens were almost always on the internet, and money is perhaps a factor, reports smithsonian. Just 16 % of people who earn $ 30,000 or less said they were almost always online compared to 28 % of people who earn $ 75,000 or more. People who live in cities, use mobile devices, and have college degrees were also more likely to go online frequently. ( here are six signs you're replacing your brain with your phone. )",

Wildlife officials say they've counted one bird being scorched to death every two minutes by intensely focused rays of light at the brightsource energy plant, considered the largest solar thermal power plant of its kind in the world. The ivanpah solar electric generating system uses more than 300,000 mirrors the size of garage doors to focus the sun's power toward \" power towers \" as many as 40 stories tall, and can power as many as 140,000 homes. Google is one of three owners of the plant at ivanpah dry lake, near the nevada border. Light beams from the $ 2.2 billion plant that opened in february are said to be so bright they dazzle pilots coming in and out of los angeles and las vegas, reports the ap. The birds igniting in midair are thought to come in droves because they are following bugs that are attracted to the light. Wildlife experts say that at least 1,000 and as many as 28,000 birds will die within a year, and grist reports that the plant has had problems with tortoises as well — scores of them were uprooted from their homes when the plant was constructed, businessweek reported in 2012. Federal wildlife officials warn that the \" mega-trap \" needs to be studied closely before more power-tower plants are opened.

The 52-year-old was convicted of ordering the 1997 murder of his boss at a motel, but his lawyers argue that the only evidence of his involvement is testimony from justin sneed, the handyman who actually carried out the killing and is serving life for it, the intercept reports.

More than 200 letters from \" jack the ripper \" were sent in the wake of the 1888 deaths, and as dr. Andrea nini's paper in digital scholarship in the humanities explains, \" the most supported theory... Is that some of the earliest key texts were written by journalists to sell more newspapers and that the same person is responsible for writing the two most iconic earliest letters. \" nini writes that he carried out a \" cluster analysis \" on 209 letters and found \" very strong linguistic evidence \" that those two iconic ones — the \" dear boss \" letter that was the first to include the name \" jack the ripper, \" and a postcard that refers to the killer as \" saucy jacky \" — were indeed written by the same person. While nini says others have come to that conclusion based on handwriting analysis, his was the first to establish this \" with certainty. \" a press release gives one example of the evidence: \" use of the phrasal verb to keep back ( to withhold ), \" described as a \" distinctive linguistic construction. \" nini also found that a third letter, the moab and midian letter that was thought to have been the work of the central news agency of london, was also likely written by that same person.

Nehemiah griego seemed like a perfectly normal kid, say locals. \" he did not fit the criteria of a kid who was crazy into guns and wanted to hurt people. That's absolutely false, \" says a former police officer who knew the family for 10 years.
