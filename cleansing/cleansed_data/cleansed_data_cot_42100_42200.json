        "summary": "The justice department has long viewed julian assange as a menace, but it might soon officially view him as a criminal. Federal prosecutors are preparing criminal charges against the wikileaks founder in order to seek his arrest, reports cnn. The possibilities range from the most serious one of espionage to lesser ones such as theft of government property, reports the washington post. Top officials such as attorney general jeff sessions must still sign off on any charges, and that hasn't happened yet. The obama white house also considered criminal charges against assange after his group published classified information obtained by chelsea manning, but ultimately decided against it on freedom-of-the-press grounds. But now prosecutors think they can make the case that assange went beyond the role of mere publisher. That argument hinges on something that came up during manning's court martial, notes the post: the revelation that manning and assange chatted about a password-cracking technique. \" i think their only realistic hope is some conspiracy charge based on wikileaks ' involvement in the actual hacking, not just publishing the results of the hacking, \" says a former justice department official. Another potential avenue to criminal charges is wikileaks ' alleged role in the hacking of us spy tools. On thursday, sessions said making arrests of leakers such as assange is a \" priority, \" reports the guardian. That follows cia chief mike pompeo's blistering criticism. Assange, meanwhile, remains holed up in the ecuadorean embassy in london, and he recently wrote an op-ed in the post arguing that wikileaks deserves the same protections as newspapers.",

After a series of brazen spam heists, the honolulu civil beat found spam at a walmart in kalihi under lock and key. Meanwhile, signs at tamura's markets on oahu read: \" all the corned beefs are relocated at the front. Please ask tamura's staff for assistance. Sorry for the inconvenience. \" the extra security follows a theft last month in which a man absconded from a safeway in waimalu with eight cases of spam, khon reports. That same month, three women were foiled while trying to steal 18 cases of spam from a longs drugs in ewa beach, according to kitv. And earlier this month a man punched a security guard at a honolulu mall and escaped with a single case of the canned meat. While spam is a \" staple \" in hawaii, tina yamaki says thieves aren't stealing it to eat. The president of the retail merchants of hawaii says she thinks cans of spam are being used as currency by desperate drug addicts. \"it's organized retail crime, \" yamaki tells the post. \"it's not like, 'i ' m going in to steal spam to feed my family. ' \" she adds: \"we've heard they work through middlemen. We've heard that they're selling it from the back of their cars. We've heard all kinds of rumors. \" yamaki says the increase in spam thefts is at least partly due to a change in theft laws passed last year that increased the felony theft threshold from $ 300 to $ 750. Thieves can now steal approximately 300 cans of spam before facing harsher felony penalties.",

        "summary": "Here's an idea for dealing with carbon dioxide: turn it into stone. Scientists in iceland say they have managed the feat at the world's largest geothermal power plant, an accomplishment the guardian says could have big implications for climate change. As they explain in science, researchers with the carbfix project figured out how to capture co2, then pump it into porous volcanic rocks deep in the earth. There, the gas combined with minerals in the basaltic rocks and turned into limestone. Scientists actually sped up that natural process and were amazed at the results: 95 % of the co2 had turned to stone within two years, reports wired. When this process occurs naturally, it can take hundreds of thousands of years. \" it was a huge surprise to all the scientists involved in the project, \" lead author juerg matter tells the bbc. By burying the emissions so deeply into such a stable form, the carbon dioxide is trapped in such a way that it cannot warm the planet, say the researchers. \" in the future, we could think of using this for power plants in places where there's a lot of basalt and there are many such places, \" says team member martin stute at columbia university. Testing is already under way in the columbia river basalts in the pacific northwest, while india, home to many dirty coal plants, also boasts enormous basalt deposits in the deccan traps. Researchers are also hoping to find an even better reaction in a rock type found in oman. The idea of burying co2 under some kind of carbon capture and storage ( ccs ) method has been experimented with successfully for decades, but one major concern has revolved around the gas leaking back out. The iceland method seems to solve that. ( see what one company wants to turn carbon pellets into. )",

They then had the subjects take a series of motor, memory, and intelligence tests, including one for abstract reasoning ( aka \" fluid \" intelligence ), wired notes.

Researchers report in the journal current biology that just looking at the rigid, geometric pattern of stripes — even still images of them — affects our brain in a way that in extreme cases can produce seizures and migraines. Objects as seemingly innocuous as radiator grills \" can be provocative, \" one expert tells the telegraph, and patients with pattern-sensitive epilepsy have to cover them as a preventive measure. \" vertical orientation of stripes are in general worse than horizontal, \" says one researcher. \" examples of striped patterns that are potentially provocative in daily life are rolling stairs, venetian blinds, striped clothes, and buildings. \" while the exact reason why is still a mystery, scientists say that stripe patterns increase our brains ' gamma oscillations, which are linked to both headaches and seizures. One hypothesis is that because the \" extreme regularity \" of things like blinds and escalators does not exist in nature — even the stripes of zebras aren't perfectly patterned — our brains have not evolved to cope with them, reports the guardian. As researchers blurred the edges of lines or distorted them slightly, those oscillations reduced. They issued a warning with their findings, but added that \" even perfectly healthy people may feel modest discomfort from the images that are most likely to trigger seizures in photosensitive epilepsy. \" next the team hopes to develop a model to predict which images are most likely to provoke these episodes.

Natalia martinez was stuck at about 12,800 feet on yukon's mount logan after two earthquakes — of magnitudes 6.3 and 6.4, reports the guardian — left the ground unstable. She was rescued via helicopter thursday night during a break in the bad weather that had kept rescue teams from reaching her earlier, the cbc reports. Her partner, camilo rada, says the 37-year-old's health is good, but a pilot with the company that originally flew her to base camp says her experience was an intense one. \" the earthquake, for want of a better term, really shook her up and... She actually had to go through quite a strong storm, \" he says. Rada, however, notes martinez's extensive experience with patagonia's \" serious weather \" left her knowing exactly how to manage the situation, though \" it's very tiring. \" upon getting off the mountain — she wasn't expecting to be rescued for another day, though the canadian press reports her food supply was still good — martinez enjoyed a warm meal, a hot shower, and the ability to sleep in friday morning. Solo ascents, as martinez's was supposed to be, are rare on the mountain, which sees about 25 climbers try to conquer it each year. ( the number of people who may attempt to climb everest this year is much higher, and that could be a problem. )",

Kusa reports that police found an unresponsive brian lucero, one stab wound to his throat, lying in the parking lot of torchy's tacos, around 1am tuesday after receiving a call. Witnesses say, per a police statement, that the fight between the 29-year-old lucero and the alleged perpetrator, 36-year-old christian gulzow, actually started at a nearby gas station. Gulzow — who was said to have been sporting white clownlike makeup with black streaks and freddy krueger-like gloves, with 2- to 3-inch blades on the fingertips — allegedly started threatening lucero, then swinging at him. Lucero fought back, and the two men eventually ended up at torchy's, where lucero collapsed in the lot. Gulzow reportedly took off on a scooter, but high activity location observation cameras the denver pd has scattered about the city picked up his trail, and he was arrested not long after, bloodied and sans weapon ( camera operators say they saw him toss a knife, which was later recovered, into the bushes ). Gulzow told cops that lucero tried to steal his scooter and that lucero may have been stabbed when they fell, perhaps impaled by one of gulzow's blades or a spike on his wrist bracelet; he says he didn't know lucero had been stabbed when he zipped away, though that's not what witnesses are saying. He's now being held on suspicion of first-degree murder charges. Lucero died at a nearby hospital of his stab wound. ( a skateboarder was allegedly stabbed by a group of clowns. )",

Caldwell and jorgeson reached the summit just after 6: 00 p.m. Est, where a contingent of 40 friends and family members, plus a group of reporters, stood ready to greet them, having arrived via an eight-mile ( 13-kilometer ) hike around the backside of the mountain.

( see pictures from the photographer who is documenting caldwell's and jorgeson's attempt to make history. ) the ascent represents the realization of caldwell's vision to find a way to free climb the dawn wall — widely considered too steep and lacking enough cracks or seams in the rock for free climbing — a dream that began seven years ago, when caldwell began exploring this historic granite face. \" this is not an effort to ' conquer, ' \" jorgeson said tuesday on twitter, from 2,000 feet ( 610 meters )"

Witnesses tell the los angeles times that things turned violent as soon as a few dozen members of the white supremacist group turned up at the sacramento rally, where they were met by hundreds of anti-nazi demonstrators. At least nine people were hospitalized — seven of them with stab wounds — and many others suffered cuts, scrapes, and bruises. A sacramento police spokesman tells the ap that the group had a permit to hold the rally and at least 100 police officers had been there to try to keep order. The twp, formed last year as an offshoot of the traditionalist youth network, another white nationalist group, had said the rally aimed to show the \" precarious situation our race is in. \" but \" the purpose of the protest was actually a reaction around the donald trump rallies where working-class white americans were trying to peacefully organize, not on racial terms, \" group spokesman matt parrott tells the sacramento bee. Parrott is believed to be the father-in-law of twp leader matthew heimbach, who was described by the washington post earlier this year as the \" next david duke \" after he was filmed shoving a protester at a trump rally in kentucky. Before the rally, heimbach tweeted a photo of some \" brave comrades. \" ( a jewish man rescued a kkk leader during similar violence at a protest in anaheim earlier this year. )",

        "summary": "That bitter tincture a bunch of mice in a columbia university lab recently gagged on could have been sweet nectar, or even just plain water. Why they took issue with the taste: for a study published in the journal nature, scientists fiddled with their brain cells to make them think they were sensing an entirely different taste — meaning taste may be nothing more than a \" fragile illusion, \" as the washington post puts it. \" taste, the way you and i think of it, is ultimately in the brain, \" lead author charles zuker explains in a press release. He notes that while there are specific receptors on the tongue to pick up the five distinct tastes ( sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and savory \" umami \" ), the signals transmitted by each receptor are picked up by discrete sets of brain cells — cells that zuker says can be effectively hacked to alter a subject's perception of a taste. And that's just what zuker and his team did to the lab mice via optogenics, which uses the power of light to \" selectively activate and deactivate the neurons associated with sweetness and bitterness, \" per the post. Zuker compares it to pressing the keys of a piano: press a certain key, get a certain sound. \" but it doesn't matter how you press the key, \" he tells the post. \" you could use [ a ] finger, an elbow, a nose. It doesn't matter how we tweak the cells; if you tweak the right cells, you get the right signal. \" he says researchers saw that manifest in the lab when a mouse with a mouthful of water started gagging because scientists had \" silenced \" sweet-detecting neurons. \" these experiments formally prove that the sense of taste is completely hardwired, independent of learning or experience, \" zuker says, per sciencealert. Further research could eventually help people with eating and other disorders, he adds. And zuker has even \" sexier \" goals in mind, per the post. \" if we could define the circuits involving courage, we could theoretically activate courage in the brain, \" he says.

Cnn reports that the ship will instead bring aid to san juan, as well to the virgin islands, then turn around and bring evacuees to fort lauderdale. Other cruise lines have similarly pitched in to help places devastated by the recent hurricanes. A look at other developments as puerto rico copes with a severe lack of food, water, and power: trump's move: president trump on thursday waived the jones act, a move that will allow foreign ships to dock at puerto rican ports with aid. The washington post has an explainer about the act and why it exists in the first place. Logjam: bloomberg reports that \" mountains \" of relief aid in the form of emergency meals and other supplies are piling up on puerto rico's ports because of the logistical nightmare of getting it distributed. Usa today says \" thousands \" of shipping containers are in such limbo, thanks to \" red tape, lack of drivers and a widespread telecommunications blackout. \" water: puerto rico has 3.4 million residents, and nearly half of them still lack potable water one week after maria blew through, reports nbc news. The situation is turning into \" hell, \" says one local doctor. Fact-checking trump: politifact looks into some of the president's recent statements about puerto rico and finds some truth-stretching going on. Attention, florida: an analysis at the washington post floats a hypothetical that could have big political consequences. If thousands of puerto ricans move permanently to the state as a result of the hurricane, that could be enough to tilt the \" swingiest of swing states \" into solid democratic territory. Generally speaking, puerto rico votes democratic. Airport: flights out of the main airport in san juan are few and far between because the hurricane largely wiped out radar and navigational systems, reports the new york times. In fact, security checks must be done by hand because tsa equipment isn't working, reports cnn. Renowned observatory: the arecibo observatory, which once held the title as the world's largest radio telescope, seems to have survived the hurricane largely intact, reports sky and telescope. But full assessments were still taking place. Big names helping: ricky martin talks to ellen degeneres about helping out in this clip.

        "summary": "If you're under the age of about 66, then big news: you've lived your entire life in the anthropocene epoch, or the age of man. At least, that what scientists who voted monday in cape town, south africa, would like to see after seven years spent considering the question. The afp reports that the declaration of an official end to the holocene — the current, nearly 12,000-year-long epoch that began at the end of the last major ice age — is a good two years off. The 35-member working group on the anthropocene's vote acts as a recommendation to the international geological congress, which is one of several academic bodies that will need to approve it. More: smithsonian has a very readable \" what is the anthropocene \" primer from 2013, which gets at one of the hearts of the debate: how to decide the precise point in the geological record ( think rocks and ice cores ) that demarcates when humans began to affect the earth. The afp explains that the start of the holocene was determined by an ice core drilled from the central greenland ice sheet; it's kept in a freezer in denmark and is said to provide \" unprecedented clarity. \" as for what \" golden spike \" will define the new epoch, the working group recommends the nuclear bomb tests that occurred around 1950 and scattered radioactive elements around the planet. The guardian has more. Working group member jan zalasiewicz says countries have traditionally been eager to submit a golden spike sample, but that there might be some hesitation this time around due to what the telegraph calls the \" negative associations \" of the anthropocene. The new yorker in 2015 looked at debate about that anthropocene golden spike ( other arguments place it in 1610 and 1964 ), but saw that as secondary to the effect of the designation, regardless of its starting point. It quotes a working group member thusly, \" it is geologists saying, ' we are witnesses to this profound and problematic transition. And we want the world to talk about it. ' \" to that end, paul crutzen — the man who coined the term anthropocene in 2000 — in 2011 wrote a column for yale environment 360 that suggests three answers to the question: \" what then does it mean to live up to the challenges of the anthropocene? \"",

A week from election day, an abc news/washington post poll shows donald trump leading hillary clinton nationally among likely voters, but only by 0.7 % with a 3-point margin of error. Still, it's trump's first lead in such a poll since may, reports cnn. Some 38 % of 1,128 likely voters polled from oct. 27-30 identified as democrat, compared to 28 % as republican and 29 % as independent. But the gap lessens to 48 % democrats and 43 % republicans when considering independents who lean one way or the other. When rounded, the figures show trump with 46 % support compared to clinton at 45 %. Gary johnson is at 3 % and jill stein at 2 %. Voters appear to favor trump 48 % over clinton's 41 % in swing states arizona, florida, north carolina, ohio, and utah, though that's with a 5.5-point margin of error. Trump also leads among voters who say they're enthusiastic about voting, 53 % to clinton's 45 %. Strong enthusiasm for clinton actually fell during the tracking period beginning oct. 20 — a possible consequence of renewed interest in her emails. Clinton supporters shouldn't freak out, though: early voters favor clinton, and a survey of the five most recent national phone polls ( including the abc/post poll ) shows her ahead of trump 46 % to 42 %. Meanwhile, abc notes mitt romney led barack obama by a point a week before election day in 2012. John kerry likewise led george w. Bush in 2004.",

Greek men used to gather at symposia to drink, chat, and be entertained, and when they reached the bottom of their wine vessels — called kylixes — they would toss the dregs at the target, livescience reports.

In other cases, players would throw wine into a saucer to fill it up, or toss wine at a saucer floating in water. Kylixes are a little hard to find these days, so the students used 3d-printed cups instead. And since this was in a classroom, not a dorm, there was no alcohol involved; instead, students tossed grape juice. The best strategy, it seems, was to put a finger through one of a kylix's handles and toss the wine out overhead. \" it must have gotten pretty messy, \" says assistant professor heather sharpe. \" by the end of our experiment we had diluted grape juice all over the floor. \" ( while students investigate the ancient greek tradition, an icon of the era is in danger. )",

And i've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? they didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom. \" the upshot is that he \" just ruined his cause, \" declared the conservative national journal in a headline.

That's almost a third less than the $ 3.59 from the same period a year ago. Part of the drop is driven by an abundance of us petroleum this year, with the cost per barrel of crude oil expected to fall from $ 107 last summer to just $ 58 this summer. \" we're on pace to have one of the lowest-priced summer driving seasons in a while, \" says an analyst. The only state that may lag behind on cheap gas is california, where a nationwide worker strike and facility explosion marred workflow at two major refineries. Even so, the government is expecting the west coast price-per-gallon to fall from last summer's average of $ 3.93 to $ 2.82, per the times. Another possible development that could cause gas prices to drop even more: sanctions against iran being lifted if a final nuclear agreement is reached, the times notes.

Mcgowan told the milwaukee journal sentinel: \"it's better than what we've been hearing and getting in terms of denial and nobody taking responsibility. \" johnson, the chairman of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs, called for the inquiry in october following a journal sentinel investigation in which dozens of americans came forward to say they were robbed, sexually assaulted or otherwise injured after drinking possibly tainted alcohol at resorts across mexico. In conner's case, the 20-year-old from pewaukee, wis., drowned after drinking tequila for less than two hours with her brother at a swim-up bar at the iberostar paraiso del mar pool.

But security officials, with the help of passing motorists, doused the blaze with fire-extinguishers, thwarting the suicide attempt, the ap reports. Today also saw a man set himself on fire inside his car in mauritania, and two light up in algeria. Algeria has now seen a total of seven men set themselves on fire. The protesters had various reasons for their actions — one terminally-ill algerian was protesting medical costs, while the cairo man's grievance was apparently the price of bread — but all seem to be imitating mohamed bouazizi, the 26-year-old whose death set off massive protests that have captivated the arab world. \" are we now seeing a trend? \" asks blake hounshell of foreign policy. \" it's a shocking, desperate tactic that instantly attracts attention, revulsion, but also sympathy. \"",

            "As protesters overwhelmed former president zine el-abidine ben ali's security forces in tunis, the regional office of the middle east partnership initiative ( mepi ), the george w. Bush administration's signature democracy promotion organization, watched as its mandate was fulfilled in the most unlikely of places. It is, to say the least, an awkward bit of symbolism. Mepi defines its mission as \" develop[ ing ] more pluralistic, participatory, and prosperous societies. \" and in the country where it is based, the tunisian people proved themselves to be uniquely and spectacularly unhappy with their regime. But according to current and former democracy promotion advocates in the u.s. Government, the decision to base mepi's offices in tunisia was made because the embassy had enough free space to accommodate its staff, and the country was thought to be stable enough to not interfere with the organization's sometimes controversial work. Scott carpenter, a former deputy assistant secretary of state in the bush administration who oversaw the creation of mepi, said that the ben ali regime was \" constantly paranoid \" about the organization's presence in the country, and never allowed it to undertake significant democracy promotion programs. As a result, \" we were doing a lot of stuff very, very quietly - not to say covert, but very quietly, \""

The report from deloitte access economics notes the reef — with a \" total asset value \" of $ 42 billion, almost half of which comes from tourism — is the biggest contributor to australia's economy, adding $ 4.85 billion per year while supporting 64,000 jobs, including 39,000 direct jobs, reports the guardian. \" the livelihoods and businesses it supports across australia far exceeds the numbers supported by many industries we would consider too big to fail, \" the report states. In comparison, a new $ 16.5 billion coal mine in queensland — which critics say is a threat to the reef — will contribute $ 154 million to the economy per year and will add 10,000 jobs. The great barrier reef foundation commissioned the report \" to understand precisely what the reef contributes and, therefore, what we stand to lose without it, \" the chairman says, calling it \" a call to action. \" the report notes half of all coral in the great barrier reef has been lost in the last 30 years as a result of coral bleaching, extreme weather, and changes in water quality with \" continued decline \" expected, per abc australia. More than 60 % of 1,500 people from 11 countries surveyed for the report said they would pay to protect the reef, per the sydney morning herald and the bbc. It's understandable why, says al gore: \" any failure to protect this indispensable natural resource would have profound impacts not only to australia but around the world. \" ( this could help save the reef. )",

The details: according to now-unsealed affidavits, investigators came across a map in harold henthorn's jeep that showed the trail where the couple hiked, with a big \" x \" in pink highlighter at the spot where wife toni plunged off the cliff. When asked about it, henthorn \" appeared at a loss for words, \" the affidavit says. The timeline of the text message he says he was reading the moment his wife fell doesn't match up to phone records; the police didn't find the binoculars toni was supposedly looking through when she fell; and he said it took him 45 minutes to hike down to her body, while it took authorities only 10 minutes to hike up from that spot to the cliff's edge, cbs denver reports. Toni was a successful ophthalmologist with oil and gas investments, abc 7 notes, while investigators can't find any records of the fundraising business henthorn supposedly owned. A former employee of toni's says that henthorn told her he had worked up \" financial profiles \" of the three women ( including toni ) he had been dating before their marriage and \" decided on toni. \" henthorn reportedly has access to $ 1.5 million, partly due to toni's life insurance policies, which totaled $ 4.5 million. In a 2011 incident, toni was injured by lumber henthorn dropped off the deck while they were fixing up their grand lake cabin. Toni reportedly told her mom, \" if i hadn't bent down after i walked outside, the beam would have killed me. \" toni's mom said henthorn asked his wife to come outside. The couple's marriage is described as a \" dictatorship, \" according to abc 7, with witnesses saying henthorn had toni's cellphone calls forwarded to him; toni's mother told police that whenever she spoke to toni on the phone, it was on speakerphone with henthorn sitting right there.

            "Photo frankfurt — volkswagen is expected to offer cash to the owners of diesel cars in the united states this coming week as it steps up an effort to recover some of the good will it lost after admitting in september that the vehicles were programmed to cheat on emissions tests. Volkswagen officials said the company would make an announcement on monday but would not confirm a report on an automotive website that diesel owners would be offered up to $ 1,250. The site, the truth about cars, said the owners would get a cash card worth $ 500 that they could spend any way they liked, and another $ 500 to $ 750 that they could spend at a volkswagen dealer. The company faces lawsuits from owners seeking compensation for the decreased resale value of the roughly 500,000 volkswagen and audi vehicles that were equipped with illegal software. It was not clear whether owners would have to give up any rights to sue if they accepted the cash. The software allowed the cars to detect when emissions testing was underway and turn on the emissions controls. But when the cars were on the road, they emitted up to 40 times the permissible amount of nitrogen oxide, which is harmful to the lungs. Volkswagen has promised to make changes to cars so they comply with emissions limits. But the repairs are likely to be costly and complicated",
            "Update: added background. Volkswagen of america, in a bid to regain the trust of current diesel owners, will announce a prepaid card campaign on november 9, ttac has learned. The program, detailed to dealers thursday in preparation of its public announcement, is aimed at current owners of affected tdi models regardless of whether they bought their car new or used. Two prepaid cards will be offered to those tdi owners. The first one will be for $ 500 and has no restrictions on where it can be used. The second, which may be valued between $ 500 and $ 750, will be limited to use at volkswagen dealerships. According to our tipster, owners of affected models will need to visit their local volkswagen dealership with proof of vehicle ownership to activate the prepaid cards. Owners can find out if they qualify for the \"tdi goodwill program \" by going to www.vwdieselinfo.com and doing a vin lookup on or after november 9. If they qualify, owners will then be asked to register to receive updates regarding future developments on their diesel vehicles.

Perhaps because of the influence of the politicians who worked in the city, several universities and colleges were built there. The city's manufacturing industry helped the population to rise to 134,000 in 1950. It is now under 95,000. The higher education institutions in the region have begun to help albany become a regional center for information technology and the biotechnology industries, but these are not large enough to offset declines in the city's fortunes which began in the 1960s. Now known mostly for its gambling business, atlantic city was dying before legislation allowed gaming companies to operate there. The city was created as a tourist location in the 1880s and a number of massive hotels were built there. Atlantic city's hospitality industry also made it a favorite for trade shows and conventions. The democratic national convention was held there in 1964.

            "San antonio — biomedical research with captive chimpanzees, an enterprise that has helped save millions of human lives, is being dismantled. The national institutes of health, citing a reduced need for chimps in research as well as their \"likeness to humans, \" recently decreed that all but 50 of the 451 chimps that are federally owned or supported will be retired and moved to sanctuaries. As the chief scientific officer at a research institute that has 90 chimps supported by the n.i.h., i bemoan this development. In my view, the benefits of such research outweigh the costs. Many people disagree with me, citing their commitment to animal welfare. But here is a fact about animal welfare that my opponents fail to consider: research with captive chimpanzees is vital to the development and testing of vaccines that can help save the lives not just of humans but also of wild chimpanzees and gorillas. It could even help those species from becoming extinct. Wild great ape populations are being decimated by diseases. Over the last 20 years, ebola hemorrhagic fever has killed a third of the wild gorilla population and nearly as high a fraction of the wild chimpanzee population. Of the chimps in gombe stream national park, in tanzania, more than 40 percent are affected by chimpanzee aids; their death rate is 10 to 16 times higher than that of",

        "summary": "For more than 50 years, the death of swedish diplomat dag hammarskjold has remained one of the era's biggest mysteries. The un secretary-general's plane plummeted out of the skies in september 1961 in northern rhodesia ( now zambia ) as he flew to orchestrate a ceasefire between congo's government and katanga province separatists; a 1962 crash report pointed the finger at pilot error, the guardian reports. But with new evidence reportedly on the table, including testimony from locals that had been previously swept under the rug, sweden will today ask the un to form an independent panel to assess the evidence. The panel would be able to appeal for nsa and cia files on the crash, as well as classified documents from the uk and other countries. Rumors have run rampant since the crash, including one that claims a second plane had been near hammarskjold's albertina dc-6, the observer notes. The acting security chief on hammarskjold's plane — who died of his injuries a few days after the crash — reportedly told medical staff he had seen \" sparks in the sky, \" while a belgian pilot claimed he sent the albertina crashing down by mistake after he fired warning shots at the plane's wing. Other witnesses insisted they saw the albertina sprinkled with bullets and men in combat uniforms at the crash site, and there were whispers that hammarskjold had been shot and was found on a termite mound with an ace of spades playing card on his collar. It didn't help stave off conspiracy theories when former president harry truman said the day after the crash that hammarskjold \" was on the point of getting something done when they killed him. \"",

The showdown came amid talks between japan and china over the matter. At the meeting, china told japan it \" will never tolerate japan's unilateral acts which violate china's territorial sovereignty, \" a chinese official says, adding that talks will continue.

Cornell university researchers surveyed 501 random women between 20 and 35 about their cooking habits, then took height and weight measurements to discover each participant's body mass index, npr reports. What they found: women \" who watched cooking shows and cooked frequently from scratch, \" also known as the \" doers, \" weighed an average of 164 pounds. The \" viewers, \" women who watched the shows but didn't usually cook the recipes, weighed an average of 153 pounds — or 11 pounds lighter. \" being a doer may put you at risk for packing on extra pounds \" and \" for having a higher bmi, \" study author lizzy pope explains. Those who used social media, including pinterest, to find recipes were also linked to a higher bmi, smithsonian reports. Other women said dieticians, magazines, cooking blogs, newspapers, health websites, and youtube influenced their cooking habits, but they weren't associated with a higher bmi, the washington post reports. Previous research found the more time women cooked at home, the higher their chance of developing symptoms of metabolic syndrome. But pope warns that her study and others don't suggest you should just eat out instead: the key is finding healthy recipes, she says, and cooking show recipes are \" not necessarily portraying healthy recipes. \" in fact, they lead viewers to assume that regularly cooking with fatty foods, like butter, is normal. \" restaurant-quality meals really shouldn't be eaten every day, \" pope says. \" food show executives and hosts need to realize they are social role models and have a role to play in battling obesity and health care costs. \" ( read a case for why you should give up three meals a day. )",

It stars office alum ellie kemper in the lead role as a sunny young woman released back into the world after 15 years in a bunker. Some opinions: kevin fallon, daily beast: \" it can't be oversold how big a win this is for fey and ( 30 rock cohort robert ) carlock, who prove themselves just as adept at characterizing a protagonist's joie de vivre as they are at crafting a woman content with merely working on her night cheese. Going the route of happy when everyone else is veering dark, they've solidified themselves as not just bravura comedy writers — which we already knew they were — but industry risk-takers, too. \" willa paskin, slate: nbc passed on this? it \" would instantly have been funnier than any show it currently has on the air. \" give fey and carlock time to develop their themes and supporting cast. \" but they still have complete mastery of their rhythm: cracks, asides, observations, and goofy references fly by so quickly, as a viewer you start to play a kind of reverse dodgeball — desperately doing whatever you can to get pegged by a punch line. \" brian moylan, guardian: \" i can think of nothing better than sitting through all 13 episodes in a row on a rainy afternoon when you need something to live for. That something is a cult survivor who lives in a closet in a basement apartment in brooklyn. Just trust me. \" vicki hyman, nj.com: she expected more from fey. \" so why am i not nuts about it? it's funnier than most of what's on television these days, but it never coalesces into something spectacular. \" still, it's a solid b+.",

Megan stammers and her teacher jeremy forrest, 30, were found walking on a bordeaux street, police say. He now faces charges of child abduction. They had left the uk on a ferry sept. 20; police were notified when stammers wasn't at school the next day, the bbc reports. Despite the british focus on the case, france apparently wasn't as concerned, partly because as a 15-year-old, stammers was at the age of consent there. \" it's important to stress that the police have dozens of people on these missing persons'registers and they will not be actively searching for the couple, \" a less-than-enthused prosecutor told the bbc previously. The telegraph fills in details of the days before stammers disappeared: \" she was really happy, jumping around, \" her mother says. \" she grabbed my shoulders and she said to me, ' mum, can you look me in the eye?

Researchers now say they've found images of the bird in a manuscript penned by holy roman emperor frederick ii over a seven-year period beginning in 1241, shifting the timeline forward on when the bird was first depicted in europe. It's more than a bit of trivia: the guardian reports the discovery has \" sparked a reassessment \" of centuries-old trading routes. The drawings in the art of hunting with birds, which is in the vatican library's possession, are of either a triton or subspecies of yellow-crested cockatoo, which was likely a female and would have hailed from either the northern australian or papua new guinea area. Australian historian and study co-author dr. Heather dalton gives context to the find: \" we tend to think of our region... As the very last things to be discovered; the european view is it's almost this dead continent and nothing was happening until europeans discovered it. \" the cockatoo wasn't the result of european discovery but rather a gift to frederick ii from the then-sultan of egypt, per a note in latin next to one of the sketches, reports the bbc, indicating an australasia-egypt trading route. In an article, dalton writes that it was customary for leaders to gift exotic animals at the time, citing the 1251 exchange of a polar bear from the king of norway to henry iii. Frederick was known to be partial to birds, and the \" white parrot \" would have been able to withstand what would have been a years-long passage.

The ohio woman survived nearly two years before dying in 2017 at age 33; slager, 42, pleaded no contest in 2016 to charges including arson and assault, and is now charged with her murder. Last week, a judge ruled that a \" deathbed testimony \" malinowski gave will be used at the trial, people reports. The judge said the situation is unprecedented, the ap reports. Malinowski, who was burned over about 90 % of her body in the attack, testified against slager from her hospital room five months before she succumbed to her injuries, fox news reports. Slager's attorneys tried to claim prosecutors improperly obtained the video testimony, but the judge noted that \" the state wanted to preserve her testimony due to her fragile medical condition. She was critically ill, and was the only witness who could testify about the events that transpired on the day of her injury. \" he also found that the defendant did have his right to confrontation recognized, as two-thirds of the deposition was cross-examination by slager's lawyers, 10 news reports. \" judy...

When the world heritage site we know as the alamo opened in san antonio as the mission san antonio de valero, it wasn't the first iteration of the mission. Archeologists now think it was initially founded at a different site in 1718, then moved about a mile away from 1719 until 1724, when a hurricane forced the mission to move a final time. And the researchers also believe that the earliest alamo predecessor has been found. A three-year investigation at a parking lot, field, and courtyard owned by san antonio's christopher columbus italian society has turned up artifacts that link the site to the mission, including pottery fragments, beads, hand-made nails, stone flakes, gun flints, colonial glass, and a grinding stone possibly dating to the early 18th century, reports the san antonio express-news. Some artifacts were even lying visible on the ground. \" i looked down and started seeing the metal and i literally, really, i just had to sit down on the ground because i was like,'this is too incredible, ' \" archaeologist kay hindes tells news 4 san antonio. Topography and written records also suggest the original mission was located in the vicinity of the site.

According to a press release, until last month the mexican blindcat was only confirmed to exist in mexico. Then two were found in a limestone cave at texas ' amistad national recreation area and identified by the university of texas'dean hendrickson. \" i've seen more of these things than anybody, and these specimens look just like the ones from mexico, \" hendrickson says. Mexican blindcats have no eyes and a pinkish-white color due to the blood that can be seen through their translucent skin, cbs dfw reports. The fish are less than 3 inches long and live in the complete darkness of water-filled caves. The mexican blindcat was first described in mexico, where it's an endangered species, in 1954. There have been rumored sightings in texas since the 1960s, but nothing was confirmed until may. Their discovery in texas strengthens a theory that underground caves connect an aquifer below mexico and texas. The two mexican blindcats found in texas have been sent to a special facility at the san antonio zoo, the ap reports. They are not currently on view to the public. The mexican blindcat is now the third species of blindcat in the us, along with the toothless blindcat and the widemouth blindcat. All of them are in texas.

The bearded man climbed the huge tree outside a macy's store downtown around 11am and pelted cops and medics with an apple, pine cones, and branches, the seattle times reports. He managed to spend the night in the sequoia despite chilly temperatures. Police initially closed off streets in the area but were reopening them on wednesday. They say the man, who claimed to be carrying a knife, appears to be suffering some kind of mental health crisis and their first priority is his safety. Meanwhile, komo is live-streaming the unusual standoff. The climber, believed to be a local homeless man, has \" just been up in the tree for a few hours now, cussing at people and throwing pine cones, \" a witness told the times on tuesday. Phoenix jones, seattle's own superhero, arrived at the scene tuesday night but was unable to coax the man down with an offer of a sandwich and a beer, q13 reports. Perhaps inevitably, #manintree became an internet sensation, the daily dot reports. The seattle post-intelligencer reports that spoof twitter accounts have been created for the man, a firefighter who climbed a ladder to try to talk to him, and the tree itself.

Russell is now in rhode island. Also of note: the fbi does indeed have dzhokhar's laptop and is examining it for evidence, reports both abc and cnn.

In the 1970s, researchers gave subjects each between one and six drinks a half-hour to an hour before bedtime. Those who had more booze fell asleep quicker, but during the second half of the night, they experienced what researchers called a \" rebound effect \": they woke more often and didn't sleep as deeply, the washington post explains in an excerpt from the blog gaines, on brains. Why? experts theorize that at first, the body compensates for the alcohol; as the night goes on, however, the brain \" overcompensates, \" writes jordan gaines, worsening our sleep. The metabolization process wakes us up as gamma-aminobutyric acid, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, is turned into glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter which affects our sleep. Binge drinking is sure to prevent a good night's sleep. As for a small nightcap, gaines recommends that if you have it, have it early, so the body has time to process it and your sleep is undisturbed. That will improve your waking life: as fast company has put it, \" hate productivity? enjoy that nightcap. \" in related news, hangovers cost the us economy $ 160 billion annually.",

Many of us have experienced it. A few of us even swear by it — enough to partake in a glass or two of wine before crawling into bed. A nightcap. In fact, a little booze has been experimentally ( and anecdotally ) demonstrated to help us fall asleep faster and increase slow-wave, or deep, sleep in the first half of the night. But its effects on other aspects of sleep — notably, the second half of the night — leave little to be desired. What causes alcohol's strange and dichotomous effect on the sleeping brain? and the real question: do you accept the nightcap or not? research on alcohol and sleep dates back to — well, almost to the dawn of sleep research.

Yet not all sleep is experienced equally: it's not just about the quantity of sleep you get, but the quality of the sleep.

            "Studies show that booze helps us fall asleep, but halfway through the night it may wake our brains up. ( istockphoto ) \"alcohol makes you sleepy. \" we've all heard about it. Many of us have experienced it. A few of us even swear by it — enough to partake in a glass or two of wine before crawling into bed. A nightcap. In fact, a little booze has been experimentally ( and anecdotally ) demonstrated to help us fall asleep faster and increase slow-wave, or deep, sleep in the first half of the night. But its effects on other aspects of sleep — notably, the second half of the night — leave little to be desired. What causes alcohol's strange and dichotomous effect on the sleeping brain? and the real question: do you accept the nightcap or not? research on alcohol and sleep dates back to — well, almost to the dawn of sleep research.

Yet not all sleep is experienced equally: it's not just about the quantity of sleep you get, but the quality of the sleep.

But then there's reid and her 7-year-old daughter. As the chronicle explains, reid's youngest child, brooke, began showing signs of autism at 2: wild tantrums, repetitive behavior, communication issues, digestive problems. Tests revealed the girl was moderately autistic. Reid began researching diet options, first eliminating gluten and dairy; then she read about msg, and the role glutamate plays in the body: it's essential for learning and function, but she came to believe that too much of it interferes with neural function — and that the glutamine in msg can exacerbate the imbalance. She wiped msg from brooke's diet ( santacruz.com notes it's even found in toothpaste ), and says the autism symptoms have been \" completely removed. \" one doctor who treats kids with autism says he'd try the diet, but cautions that \" while it's not normal for kids with moderate autism to be cured by 7, it's not unheard of. \" still, reid says 99 % of the 75 autistic children she has worked with at her unblind my mind foundation \" drastically improved within five weeks. \"",

That post blew up, getting shared more than 6,000 times, and on july 18 around 100 people arrived to paint. Abc 7 reports even more people stopped by to drop off food and drinks; in fact, the outpouring was so generous they had enough food leftover to donate to the salvation army.

        "summary": "The annual pumpkin festival in keene, new hampshire, got a bit out of hand yesterday. It seems that students at nearby keene state college threw an afternoon party celebrating the festival, and after brawls at that gathering, another throng congregated in the same part of town — near both the college and the festival — last night. Riot police responded to both incidents. At least 30 people were hurt in the afternoon, most of them hit by bottles and other objects, and about 12 people were arrested, necn reports. Emts reportedly had to dodge bottles themselves as they tried to help people who were hurt. Then, last night, crowds reportedly lit fires, engaged in vandalism, and attempted to flip over at least one car, boston.com reports. The police \" just started walking on the street, with, like, mace, tear gas, and these rubber bullets, \" says one witness. The violence, which included dumpsters being overturned, continued into the early morning hours today, the boston globe reports. One festival visitor tells nhpr her car was surrounded by a hundreds-strong mob in the afternoon as she tried to leave, and the revelers punched, kicked, and shook it while screaming at her 12-year-old daughter in the back seat. \" they put their faces in the window and made these horrible faces and screamed these terrible things at her, \" she says. \" and then they started taking off their shirts and pushing themselves into the windows. At that point she was just beyond consoling. \" apparently similar brawls took place during the festival last year — which is perhaps why keene's police department recently cited the festival as a reason it needed the pentagon to give it a surplus $ 286,000 armored vehicle. Both the colbert report and last week tonight with jon oliver made fun of the department for that, but when all was said and done last night, keene had four times its typical number of first responders on hand and still had to call for back-up.",

        "summary": "Baltimore police are keeping an eye on city residents from the sky. On tuesday, bloomberg businessweek revealed the secret aerial surveillance system police had been using since january, and on wednesday, police confirmed they have indeed been carrying out aerial surveillance to investigate crimes, the guardian reports. But a police spokesperson insists it's \" not a secret surveillance program \" and \" there was no conspiracy not to disclose it. \" but even the mayor, city council, and board of estimates were in the dark about the program until the bloomberg story came out. Police say the system was used for 100 hours between january and february and 200 hours over the summer, and that it will be used for a few more weeks as police decide whether to use it permanently. ( the controversial system has been used elsewhere. ) per bloomberg's story, the surveillance involves a cessna plane that circles the city for up to 10 hours a day, armed with sophisticated cameras that transmit real-time images to analysts on the ground; the footage is also reportedly archived for later use if needed. Persistent surveillance systems provided the system, which allows police to track suspects as they move around, and it was privately funded. A slew of officials and activists have slammed both the surveillance and the fact that police kept it secret for so long, including the aclu and the office of the public defender. A government surveillance expert says the legal standing of the surveillance system is unclear, since it's \" currently being litigated in a number of areas, \" but that citizens may have \" a constitutional right to be free from pervasive location tracking without court authorization. \"",

The photo has already received more than 30,000 likes and almost 19,400 retweets as the world tries to pinpoint who gave birth to whom. And the news-sun documents viewers ' intricate sleuthing methodology, with some internet detectives insisting the mom has to be in the middle because the two on the outside look too much alike. Others go even deeper: the girl on the right is the one taking the photo, and a mother wouldn't be sitting in the back, so mom has to be the one on the left in the black blazer. Turns out that last theory is the correct one, though at least one user is content to just be enamored with all three. \" i don't understand how so much perfection can be allowed in one picture, \" the commenter tweets. A video posted on instagram gives viewers a second perspective on the mom and her two high schoolers.

But it was offering $ 5,000 for a strand of hillary clinton's hair that finally proved a bridge too far. Bloomberg reports a judge revoked the former pharmaceutical ceo's bail and ordered him immediately to jail wednesday. Judge kiyo matsumoto ruled the 34-year-old shkreli \" may be an ongoing danger or risk to the community, \" according to cnbc. Shkreli had been out on $ 5 million bond following his conviction on securities fraud charges last month for which he faces up to 20 years in prison. He will now remain in jail until his scheduled sentencing on those charges in january. Shkreli offered $ 5,000 for a strand of clinton's hair on facebook following his conviction. In response, the secret service opened an investigation and prosecutors asked the judge to revoke his bail. Shkreli struck a defiant pose online, posting on facebook: \" come at me with your hardest because i haven't seen anything impressive yet. \" but in a letter to the judge asking to be allowed to remain out of jail, shkreli was apologetic, writing: \" i used poor judgment but never intended to cause alarm or promote any act of violence whatsoever. \" while shkreli's lawyers said the post was \" political satire or strained humor, \" matsumoto ruled it was basically a \" solicitation of an assault \" and not protected by the first amendment, the ap reports.",

Romney's \" slow, unsteady march \" to the nomination \" is coming at a steep price, \" writes dan balz for the washington post. \" nomination battles often strengthen the winner, but some take a toll. \" considering his demographic ( possible trouble with latinos, women, and independents ) and geographic ( polls show him behind obama in ohio and virginia ) woes, \" romney is in worse shape at this point in the campaign than virtually all recent previous nominees. \" \" all of his flaws were on full display \" last night, agrees jonathan martin for politico. And here's one tough lesson that emerged: \" getting to tampa is going to prove longer and costlier than he and his advisers had hoped — a predicament that has republicans increasingly anxious and president barack obama's high command downright gleeful. \" last night could have had a very different feel, writes ej dionne for the washington post. Because some \" ohio counties reported so late, [ romney ] didn't get full credit for that this evening. \" and that means that \" the impact of this super tuesday will depend a great deal on spin. Over the next couple of days, romney has to win the interpretation wars. \"",

Last week, he said there was a \" vast consensus of scientists \" who say we are causing climate change, though he didn't say he agreed. And last year, he referred to a \" reasonable debate \" over the matter. All this sounds different from the rubio of 2008, who, the miami herald notes ( via the tampa bay times ), oversaw a unanimous florida house vote for rules on carbon emissions. Not to mention the rubio of 2009, who said he backed a cap-and-trade mandate. Others agree with marcus on rubio's flip-flopping: yesterday, he addressed his sunday comments, and \" it appeared he was trying to keep one foot in the climate change camp and the other in the deniers ' camp, \" writes eleanor clift at the daily beast, noting that it looked like an effort to position himself for both the 2016 primaries and the general election.

Discovery news reports that researchers with the international group of historic aircraft recovery spotted earhart's lockheed electra — given away by the registration number on its wing — in the 1936 film love on the run. It appears that even official earhart biographers were unaware of the famous plane's star turn. In the film, the lockheed carrying gable and joan crawford narrowly avoids running into a crowd of spectators during a comically rough takeoff. ( \" i wonder what all those gadgets are for? \" asks gable upon surveying the cockpit. ) you can watch the scene here. \" it is little wonder that this bizarre and undignified use of earhart's vaunted new ' flying laboratory ' was kept quiet, \" the group known as tighar states on its facebook page. Love on the run debuted about eight months before earhart's disappearance in july 1937. Stunt pilot paul mantz, who also served as earhart's technical adviser, performed the takeoff in the film. The plane was delivered to earhart on her 39th birthday on july 24, 1936, within weeks of the scene being filmed. It's unclear if she knew it was used in the movie. Tighar, meanwhile, is preparing a new submersible-led mission in hopes of finding earhart's plane in the summer of 2017. ( in an old photo, investigators spotted a repair made to the plane that may provide a clue. )",

Larger and heavier pieces may still lie obscured on the reef slope, or at the point below 1000 feet where the slope becomes less acute than it is higher up.

He added that many of the clams appeared to have been opened by someone who tried to pry them apart on the hinge side, others have been opened by smashing them with rocks. Whoever camped there was catching small reef and lagoon fish, cooking them on the coals, not consuming the heads, and disposing of their bones in the fires. \" none of this behavior is consistent with fishing and fish preparation by indigenous pacific islanders, \" said king.

This was just one example of the conditions given to two inmates in forced fights that public defender jeff adachi says were arranged by guards in san francisco's main county jail, reuters reports. The report adachi released yesterday reveals details of the alleged battles, claiming that four guards — including deputy scott neu, who settled out of court almost a decade ago after accusations he forced two transgender inmates to perform sexual acts on him — trained at least one of the prisoners to fight, placed bets on the jailhouse battles, and then demanded the inmates lie about their injuries, the san francisco chronicle reports. \" deputy neu forced these young men to participate in gladiator-style fights for his own sadistic entertainment, \" adachi said in a statement, per reuters. One inmate who was allegedly forced to fight told adachi that neu had instructed them to say they fell out of their bunks if they needed medical treatment; that inmate, who weighs 150 pounds, says he was made to fight a 350-pound inmate. An attorney for the city's sheriffs ' union issued a statement to the chronicle that said the accusations were \" exaggerated, \" the fighting \" horseplay, \" and adachi's efforts \" a cursory sham investigation. \" adachi, meanwhile, says he went public now because he got wind of another planned fight. Neu and three other deputies are on paid administrative leave until the investigation wraps up, per reuters; the two inmates have been transferred for \" their protection, \" the san francisco sheriff said at a press conference yesterday.",
