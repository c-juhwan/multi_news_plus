        "summary": "Though it was previously confirmed that meghan markle's father would attend his daughter's wedding to prince harry this weekend and walk her down the aisle, thomas markle now tells tmz he's not going. Thomas markle, who is divorced from meghan's mother, tells the gossip site he was tired of being caught by the paparazzi in unflattering situations ( including \" buying beer, looking disheveled and reclusive, \" per tmz ), so he agreed when a paparazzi agency offered to pay him if he let photographers take pictures of him getting ready for the royal wedding. An uproar ensued over the staged photos, and thomas markle says he decided not to attend the wedding so as to avoid embarrassing his daughter or the british royal family. Asked about the tmz report by cnn, kensington palace said only, \" this is a deeply personal moment for ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and prince harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to mr. Markle in this difficult situation. \" thomas markle had a heart attack six days ago, he tells tmz, but he had checked himself out of the hospital in order to attend the wedding before he changed his mind. He says the staged photos look \" stupid and hammy \" and that he didn't mean to cause drama for his daughter or the royals; he also says he was not paid anywhere close to the $ 100,000 that has been reported ( and that he's turned down multiple requests to be interviewed for up to $ 100,000 ). As people reports, meghan markle's estranged half-sister samantha says she's the one who arranged for their dad's photo shoot in an effort to improve his public image. Samantha has spoken out against her sister and prince harry more than once, and it was recently reported that meghan markle \" has no relationship \" with her half-siblings ( she also has a half-brother, thomas markle jr. ) and they would not be attending the wedding.",

        "summary": "North korea is showing no signs of abandoning its quest for nuclear weapons. A state department official tells reuters the country has restarted a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor at its main nuclear complex at yongbyon to get plutonium. The international atomic energy agency said monday there were \" indications \" that was the case. \" they take the spent fuel … let it cool and then take it to the reprocessing facility, and that's where they've obtained the plutonium for their previous nuclear tests. So they are repeating that process, \" the official says. Experts believe the reactor could produce up to 13 pounds of plutonium per year. Last month, south korea's defense minister estimated the north had 88 pounds, which could supply eight to 10 bombs. Meanwhile, curtis melvin, an expert on north korean geography at johns hopkins university, says satellite images show a new special forces driver-training facility near the western border with south korea, a new railway line between a shipyard and naval base near wonsan in the east, and new airfields, though some are reportedly for kim jong un's private use, reports the washington post. \" there is no indication that north korea is reducing the size of its conventional armed forces \" while focusing on nuclear weapons, one expert says. \" i think they're pushing ahead on both fronts. \" how it can afford to do so is up for debate. South korea estimates north korea's economy is growing at 1 % to 2 % per year and \" there's no way they can be doing all of this on 1 % growth, \" melvin says.",

However, hunters who kill strictly for meat are still allowed to do so, provided they don't take those body parts. The new law doesn't spell out what the meat hunters should do with those items, but they ' ll need to leave them behind. The rule takes effect in november, at the end of this year's season. \" society has come to the point in bc where they are no longer in favor of the grizzly bear trophy hunt, \" says natural resources minister doug donaldson. \" it is time. \" the meat loophole, though, has grizzly advocates a little worried because \" virtually no one legitimately hunts grizzlies for food, \" says the director of a conversation group. \" killing these bears is strictly a trophy hunt. \" bc has about 15,000 bears, and hunters kill about 250 each year; the meat-versus-trophy breakdown of those 250 isn't clear.

Different beast \" sig sauer mcx rifle was used in orlando, notes the washington post — is 18 months old, and if it goes to trial, it won't be for another two years. But few expected it to get as far as it has. Connecticut judge barbara n. Bellis refused to dismiss the case, established a trial date ( which \" startled \" some plaintiffs ), and ordered that the discovery phase begin, though the case may still not go to trial. Bellis must make that determination by october; each side will plead its position a final time on monday. Even if a trial does occur, the guardian paints the suit as having a \" remote chance of success. \" the suits'defendants — manufacturer remington, a distributor, and a local gun shop — reference the 2005 federal shield law that has stopped most would-be suits by victims of gun violence, as it provides the makers and sellers with immunity when their guns are used in a crime. And so the plaintiffs are going after them via a \" creative legal move, \" per the guardian: the shield doesn't cover negligent entrustment, in which someone who shouldn't have a gun is sold one. While nancy lanza legally purchased the gun used by her son in the sandy hook massacre, the families are arguing that it's negligent for any american to be able to buy a \" high-velocity... Weapon of war, \" as the times puts it.",

In doing so, he made it legal for businesses in the state to refuse service \" because of a religious opposition to same-sex marriage, extramarital sex, or transgender people, \" npr reports. Bryant says he signed the bill in order to protect citizens with \" deeply held religious beliefs \" and argues it's not discriminatory. Opponents of the bill, of which there were many, disagree. Cnn reports the mississippi economic council, the mississippi manufacturers association, nissan, tyson foods, toyota, at&t, levi's, the aclu, and many more all officially opposed the bill. Bryant lauds hb1523 for its specificity, pointing out that it won't allow restaurants to refuse to serve a gay diner but will allow restaurants to refuse to host a gay wedding. It also protects state employees who refuse to issue same-sex marriage licenses. He says it renews first amendment rights for religious people while not violating federal law. But opponents argue the bill's wording allows for a broader interpretation. To use the restaurant example, businesses could refuse to serve gay couples celebrating their wedding anniversary, they argue. And it's not just same-sex couples and transgender people who will be affected by the bill. Unwed mothers and people living together outside of wedlock could also be refused service, opponents say.

        "summary": "In canada, coyotes build snowmen. In marin county, calif., they get high on mushrooms — or so it seems. At least one and possibly two coyotes have been spotted acting a bit oddly along highway 1 near bolinas, reports pacific sun. Residents describe an animal forcing nighttime drivers to stop on the twisting highway, staring them down, and attacking their vehicles before taking flight. One resident who's made several trips along the road says it's \" a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold. \" so what's up with the coyote, or coyotes? one theory being floated is that the animals are eating hallucinogenic mushrooms that grow in the area, resulting in coyotes \" vision questing their way into interactions with drivers, \" per sfist.com. Lisa bloch of the marin humane society says she can't rule it out and has been warning dog owners recently about the'shrooms. \" we are trying to figure this out, \" she says. Rabies isn't likely to blame because the disease typically fuels aggression in coyotes a week or so before causing death, and these incidents have been going on for several weeks. There's not many studies out there about the \" psychedelic effects \" of mushrooms on canines, but the animals are known to get \" especially excitable, \" which jibes with the descriptions of the coyotes ' behavior, reports outdoorhub. Another option is that a coyote was fed by people, perhaps from a car, and is now looking for more food. The problem is \" if they are not afraid of us, they come close to our cars, get hit, fight with domestic dogs, and can possibly become aggressive, \" says bloch, strongly discouraging people from feeding the animals.

In the minority camp is mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle, who not only calls it a \" funny movie \" but one in which schumer \" comes into her own as a big-screen comic actress. \" schumer didn't write the script, but she proves that she should be headlining comedies as an actress for years to come. She's mastered the \" comedy of humiliation. \" but most are like this: snatched \" piles bad ideas on good ideas and lame bits of gross-out humor on genuinely funny bits of character work, without ever building enough dramatic force or comic energy to craft a full movie from the results, \" writes kate taylor at the globe and mail.

        "summary": "Could being a winner put you on the slippery slope to becoming a cheater? a new study out of israel suggests it can. Researchers found a correlation between winning a competition and subsequently feeling entitled to win another — and study participants were willing to cheat in order to do so, phys.org reports. \" when success is measured by social comparison, as is the case when winning a competition, dishonesty increases, \" researcher amos schurr says in a press release. When success is not based on beating someone else — such as reaching a personal exercise goal — \" dishonesty decreases, \" he adds. If the researchers are correct, it could mean that one way to curb corruption and cheating is for governments, businesses, and other organizations to focus less on \" social comparisons \" and more on \" fixed goals, \" notes scientific american. In the study, researchers paired up 86 college students and had them compete against one another in a game that required estimating the number of objects on a computer screen. The \" winners \" were actually chosen at random, and they received a pair of earbuds. Next, the students played a dice game in which one rolled the dice and the other observed. Only the student rolling the dice, however, could see the result, which dictated how many shekels ( worth about a quarter apiece ) each student got. Students who had won the previous estimation game were more likely to lie and claim more shekels than they had coming to them, say the researchers. The takeaway: \" winning a competition engenders subsequent unrelated unethical behavior, \" says the study abstract in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences.

The former nyc mayoral candidate himself confirmed thursday to the new york times that the city's administration for children's services is looking into how he cares for his 4-year-old son, jordan, conceding that a \" bare-bones \" announcement about the investigation had been left at his mom's home by the agency — a humiliating drop-off that baffles even weiner. \" crazy if you ask me, \" he says. The probe into what kind of dad weiner is was prompted partially because of one of the photos in a recent sexting session, in which jordan — called by new york post columnist andrea peyser the \" saddest, most neglected little tyke imaginable \" — was seen lying in bed next to his dad wrapped in a blanket while weiner showed off his underwear-clad lower regions to a woman he'd been corresponding with over social media. The post had first reported on an investigation on wednesday, but at the time, weiner said he hadn't heard anything about it from acs.

Currently, most treatments for phobias and ptsd involve drugs, which can have side effects, or aversion therapy, which requires patients to be exposed to their fears, according to a press release. But the researchers behind the study say their technique — decoded neurofeedback, or decnef — can \" remove specific fears from the brain \" using brain scanning technology and artificial intelligence. Researchers created a fear memory in volunteers by shocking them when they saw a certain color, the guardian reports. The brain pattern created by that new fear would occasionally reappear subconsciously, without the volunteer being afraid or thinking about it. When that happened, researchers gave the volunteer a reward. Eventually, the fear memory was overwritten. Researchers believe they can substantially reduce phobias and ptsd if they can figure out the brain patterns associated with common fears, such as spiders. Researcher mitsuo kawato hopes to start \" systematic decnef therapy \" within a few years. ( your fear may make this spider look huge. )",

Over 11 years together, sam says jennifer has made her \" more positive, \" while jennifer says sam \" gets me to explore the beauty of this world. \" that's why the two weren't willing to let taiwanese law stop them from declaring their love for each other in a wedding ceremony on nov. 13, just as jennifer wasn't going to let her parents ' objections keep her from walking down the aisle. Luckily, she wasn't alone. Though her parents no longer speak to her, \" my boss and colleagues have been very supportive, \" says jennifer. In fact, when she told hsbc's taiwan ceo john li that her dad wouldn't be there to walk her down the aisle, he offered to step in. He \" told us not to be nervous and to walk slowly, \" she recalls. \" we cried because we never thought we would make it this far. \" while same-sex marriage is not yet legal in taiwan, jennifer says a ceremonial wedding was better than \" faking a marriage for my father's sake, \" something she previously considered. Still, she hopes to one day make her father proud. For now, though, the couple have one goal: to \" create respect among different communities. \"",

Richard \" scott \" silverthorne, 50, was laid off from his job with the national association of manufacturers in june of last year; his house was foreclosed on months later; he was diagnosed with cancer; and then, on thursday, he was arrested for allegedly trading meth for sex. Police received a tip three weeks ago that silverthorne, who is in his third term as mayor and was also a substitute public school teacher, was using a website on which men can arrange to have casual sex, and that silverthorne was exchanging meth for that sex. An undercover officer created a profile on that site meant to appeal to silverthorne, and they arranged to meet thursday at a hotel for \" a group sexual encounter, \" usa today reports. Silverthorne was arrested after allegedly giving meth to the undercover officers he met there. Two other men, the mayor's alleged suppliers, were also arrested outside the hotel. Authorities believe he had engaged in a \" meth-for-sex \" arrangement at least twice before. Fairfax is a wealthy dc suburb located in one of the richest counties in the nation, and silverthorne's bio on the city's website notes that he is \" a champion for quality of life issues. \" silverthorne talked about his \" terrible year \" in january with the washington post, and the newspaper noted at the time that constituents were already wondering whether he should step down as mayor to focus on his financial and health issues.

In the video, woods struggles with basic tasks. When an officer tells him to tie his left shoe, he unties his right shoe and ends up performing the field sobriety tests barefoot, espn reports. He is unable to follow a light with his eyes when asked and fails to stay balanced on the white line when asked. Asked to walk a straight line heel-to-toe, he staggers, strays from the line, and never connects heel to toe. After failing to understand the instructions twice, he manages to recite the alphabet before he is handcuffed and taken into custody. Woods has apologized for his conduct, saying he was badly affected by a mix of medications.",

The daily progress and wtop shed some light on what's been happening in the college town, as well as in the state of virginia, since the violent events earlier this month: on thursday, charlottesville police confirmed an investigation is underway on a report of vandalism that came in sunday. The subject of the vandalism: a statue of thomas jefferson apparently splattered with red paint on the north side of uva's rotunda. The college's student council executive board was presented with a list of demands from the school's black student alliance and other groups, and the board on monday endorsed those demands, which include stripping the rotunda of all confederate plaques, taking measures to help boost african-american enrollment, and mandating all students take a class on white supremacy and slavery as they tie back to jefferson, the school's founder. Charlottesville mayor mike signer says he wanted to be involved in making sure the rally was kept peaceful. But he says he and the city council were never given access to the security plan for the event, and when he asked police chief al thomas how he could help out, he claims he was told: \" stay out of my way. \" no word from thomas on that allegation. Gov. Terry mcauliffe has put in place via executive order two groups: the task force on public safety preparedness and response to civil unrest ( which will look into what happened in charlottesville on aug. 11 and 12 ) and the commonwealth commission on diversity, equity, and inclusion, designed to assess \" how hatred and discrimination against racial minorities, religious groups, and gay, lesbian, bisexual, and [ transgender ] individuals led to those tragic events. \"",

The treatment for sickle cell anemia — she needed chemotherapy first before a necessary bone marrow transplant — destroyed the function of her remaining ovary, but after the long-frozen tissue was thawed and grafted back into her body, she began menstruating for the first time and was able to conceive naturally and have a healthy baby, the bbc reports. When the tissue was removed, the teenager was showing early signs of puberty but hadn't had her first period, and doctors weren't sure if her eggs would mature. Around 40 women worldwide have given birth using frozen ovarian tissue, the bbc notes, but this is the first such birth using immature tissue. Researchers say more work needs to be done to determine whether tissue from younger girls can also restore fertility. \" there had previously been uncertainty as to whether ovarian tissue taken from young girls would later on be competent to produce mature, fertile eggs, so today's case is both reassuring and exciting, \" a professor at the leeds center for reproductive medicine tells reuters, though he adds: \" we have to remember that many children who require chemotherapy are very ill and the surgery to remove ovarian tissue is no small undertaking. \" ( earlier this year, a british woman born with no womb gave birth to twins. )",

Daniel galvan vina, who was two years into a 30-year sentence for raping 11 children aged between 4 and 14, was among 48 spanish citizens pardoned by king mohammed iv after a visit from spain's king juan carlos, cnn reports. Dozens of people were injured when people protesting the royal pardon clashed with police. The king was not \" informed on all gravity of the despicable crimes committed by this person, \" a statement on the royal website claims. Galvan, a former official in the iraqi military, worked as a spy during the rule of saddam hussein, according to reports in the spanish and moroccan media. He was apparently given a new name — and a new identity as a former professor of oceanography — by the spanish secret service before he moved to morocco in 2005, the guardian reports. He fled morocco as soon as he was pardoned and released, but may now have to serve the remaining 28 years of his sentence in a spanish prison.",

        "summary": "We're still not over germany's epic 7-1 spanking of brazil, and frankly, the soccer world may never be. The home nation crapped the bed in truly historic fashion, and today dazed observers are combing through the record books to figure out just how historic. The loss is sure to overtake brazil's 2-1 loss to uruguay in the 1950 world cup as the most scarring in the nation's history, writes jeremy stahl at slate — and that game is remembered to this day as the \" maracanã blow, \" and occasionally cited as brazil's hiroshima or 9/11. Indeed, stahl believes that every single goal made history. For example: 2-0 – this was miroslav klose's 16th goal of the tournament, breaking the previous record. The previous record holder? oh, this hurts: ronaldo, of brazil. 4-0 – brazil hadn't given up this many goals in the world cup since 1954. 5-0 – no team had scored this many goals since 1958 ( and that time brazil was the one doing the scoring ). It was the fastest any team had ever scored that many, and the third time it ever happened in one half. 6-0 – no team had scored this many goals in a semifinal since 1954. 7-1 – the final score is the widest margin of defeat in semifinals history. Nate silver at fivethirtyeight declares it \" the most shocking result in world cup history. \" by his model, germany had a roughly one in 4,000 chance of beating brazil — who silver had as the favorite — by six goals or more. On espn, former german captain michael ballack remarked that, \" something like that happens every 100 years, \" and as stahl observes, that was not hyperbole.",

Though customs and border protection isn't planning to reveal which ones made the first cut until june, some firms are sharing their plans in advance. Some notable ones, per popular mechanics and npr: a medieval slope: san diego project management has proposed a smooth, sloping wall with a ledge near the top. The ledge would not only make the wall nearly impossible to climb, it would give guards a vantage point. A wall of solar panels: the perk of this option is that the wall should \" pay for itself \" in about 20 years, a partner at gleason partners tells the ap. Each panel would produce about 2.0 megawatts of electricity per hour so as to power patrol stations nearby, the firm says. Roman-inspired: no surprise, the design from hadrian construction company is inspired by a wall built by roman emperor hadrian. Its lightweight prefabricated panels would form a 30-foot wall in a zig-zag shape. Nuclear waste: an idea from clayton industries of pittsburgh is a \" nuclear waste wall, \" which would feature trenches filled with, yes, nuclear waste. It would also have a 30-foot wall. Play a tune: the sure winner is jm design studio, which wants to line up 10 million 30-foot-tall pipe organs, leaving an open archway every 20 feet. \" the only requirement is that every person who passes through must spend at least two minutes playing the organs, \" the company says.

Though the base had a complement of about 60 soldiers, the arms cache itself was surrounded by nothing but barbed wire, the la times reports. Fortifications were deemed unnecessary because locals were too afraid of moammar gadhafi to touch the weapons. Rebels carrying small arms and some truck-mounted artillery guns stormed the base at midnight, driving out the government's soldiers in less than half an hour. Many of the weapons in the cache had already been wrecked by nato airstrikes, but rebels said the ammunition was largely salvageable.

No further fortifications were necessary. Until it was seized and pillaged by rebels tuesday, local people were too terrified of kadafi's wrath to come anywhere near it. \" there was no need even for the barbed wire, \" said mostafa mohammad, a scholar in britain who returned to his hometown of zintan, about 15 miles to the north, after the uprising against kadafi's rule began in february. He was among hundreds of rebel fighters and onlookers from all parts of the opposition-held nafusa mountain range visiting the military base after a quick battle that killed at least two opposition fighters and sent dozens of government soldiers fleeing. Rebels were galvanized in part by the international criminal court's decision monday to issue arrest warrants for the libyan leader, his son seif islam kadafi and intelligence chief abdullah sanoussi.

But toronto's michal kapral, who refers to himself as a \" joggler, \" managed to pull off exactly that at sunday's chicago marathon, npr reports, completing the course in a fairly fast 2 hours, 55 minutes ( giving him 6: 40-a-mile boasting rights ). And although the 44-year-old didn't beat his guinness world record for time — he completed a course in 2007 in 2 hours, 50 minutes while juggling — this was the first marathon he completed without dropping a ball. \" i've never felt so much stress in my life, \" he says about how he felt as he joggled closer to the finish line. Kapral's handsy hobby began when he was 11 and seeking a world record to beat. He was on his school's cross-country team and had just learned to juggle, so merging the two seemed a natural choice. Since then, he's run 33 marathons, per his blogging joggler blog, and he breaks down how it feels to accomplish this task at each point in the race, from a \" kind of zen feeling \" at the beginning to the \" absolute agony \" of the final miles as his arms give out. Kapral may have already come down off sunday's runner's high: in a tweet from wednesday, he noted: \" three days ago: ran 26.2 miles while juggling and never dropped a ball. Today: dropped my phone and cracked it. \" read his blog entry describing his sunday run, including how he kept people from bumping into him. ( this man ran 401 marathons to help lgbt kids. )",

That's exactly what happened to me at the scotiabank toronto waterfront marathon last sunday. My goal was to set a new guinness world record for the fastest marathon while joggling five objects.there was no current record, but the guinness records-keepers decided through some calculus that 4 hours 40 minutes was the time to beat. This doesn't sound very quick, but here's the thing: running while simultaneously juggling five balls is exceedingly difficult. To a non-joggler, i might put it like this: joggling a marathon with three balls is like running a regular marathon, while joggling a marathon with five balls is like running a marathon hopping on your left foot only for the entire 42.2km. It's exponentially harder the further",

The full shadow was in place by 1: 58am and \" totality, \" the time during which the moon was in complete shadow, lasted less than 90 minutes. The shadow had completely passed over the moon by 6: 37am. Why does the moon take on an eerie shade of crimson during these events? the ancient maya blamed the color on a cosmic jaguar that swallowed the moon; the ancient chinese believed it was a three-legged toad that swallowed it. The real answer, of course, is much more scientific and has to do with the moon \" reflect[ ing ] sunrises and sunsets happening around the world, \" livescience reports.

        "summary": "Police in oregon have arrested a member of the armed group occupying a federal wildlife refuge, but he may not have been the brains of the operation: kenneth medenbach, 62, was arrested at a grocery store after apparently driving a vehicle stolen from the refuge into the town of burns to buy supplies, the ap reports. The occupant of a second vehicle with government license plates had already gone into the safeway when police arrived, reports the oregonian, which notes that both vehicles had new door signs reading \" harney county resource center, \" which is what the armed occupiers are calling the malheur national wildlife refuge. The group seized the refuge two weeks ago to protest federal land policies. Medenbach is being held on suspicion of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. The oregonian reports that he was released on bail in november of charges of illegally camping on federal land, and was convicted of a similar offense in 1995. His conditions of release in november stated that he was not allowed to \" occupy \" federal land. Harney county judge steve grasty tells the guardian he is glad that an arrest has been made in the standoff. \" at some point, criminal actions become so blatant that they just can't be ignored, \" he says. The ap reports that ammon bundy and other occupation leaders planned to meet with community members on friday night, but the parley was called off after the county told them that they couldn't use the local fairgrounds.",

( nicki demarco/in play/the washington post ) florida rep. Trey radel ( r-fla. ) was arrested last month for buying cocaine. Here's what you need to know about the freshman congressman. ( nicki demarco/in play/the washington post ) late on a tuesday evening, at a dupont circle bistro that serves $ 11 mojitos, the congressman and the undercover officer talked about cocaine. They talked about how much the congressman would have to pay for it. They talked about the quality of the drug for sale. Finally, they made a deal: $ 250 for 3.5 grams, an amount generally bought for personal use. Outside, in a car, the drug and money changed hands. And then, suddenly, there were feds outside the vehicle. Before that moment, rep. Trey radel ( r-fla. ) had built a remarkable double life in washington — and built it in record time. Wednesday night, less than a month after his arrest, hours after he had pleaded guilty to a drug charge, he announced he is taking a \"leave of absence \" from congress. 1 of 8 full screen autoplay close skip ad × when an apology is needed: who has said it best",
            "( cnn ) -- u.s. Rep. Trey radel said wednesday night he will take a leave of absence for an unspecified time and donate his salary. \" i have no excuse for what i have done. I have let down our country, \" he said at a news conference. Radel spoke to reporters after returning home to southwest florida, hours after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine possession. The 37-year-old first-term republican from florida said he will enter an inpatient drug treatment program. The cocaine possession charge came after authorities said he bought a small amount of cocaine in a sting in the nation's capital last month. During the brief news conference, radel said he \" grew up with a mom who struggled with alcoholism. \" \" i don't want my son to struggle with that, \" he said. The plea and sentence were part of a deal that radel's attorney struck with federal prosecutors. He could have received a maximum sentence of 180 days imprisonment or a $ 1,000 fine, or both. Instead, he was placed on one year probation, and if it is \" successfully completed, \" his guilty plea will be cleared from his record. \" your honor, i apologize for what i've done, \" radel told judge robert tignor in court wednesday. \" i think in"

It seems that we humans secrete chemicals in sweat that reflect our emotional states, and people who happen to get a sniff pick up on the vibes, reports discovery. In the experiment, dutch researchers had men watch happy, scary, and neutral videos with absorbent pads on their armpits, explains medical news today. Afterward, they had women sniff the pads, keeping a close eye on their facial movements. Sure enough, when they sniffed the \" fear \" pads, muscles associated expressions of fear were active. The same applied to the \" happy \" pads. \" this suggests that somebody who is happy will infuse others in their vicinity with happiness, \" says lead researcher gun semin of utrecht university. \" in a way, happiness sweat is somewhat like smiling — it is infectious. \" another researcher elaborates to the huffington post on the evolutionary reason why this might have come to be: \" if chemosignals of fear may have served to warn [ fellow humans ], chemosignals produced during positive states such as happiness may have served to facilitate bonding. \" the team thinks its study in the journal psychological science has \" potential commercial applications, \" but leaves the details on that to our imaginations.

The city-owned site is undeveloped and largely out of view, but a new memorial aims to respectfully commemorate those who lost their lives because of superstition and intolerance, reports the smithsonian. Salem mayor kimberley driscoll plans to dedicate the site below what is called proctor's ledge on july 19, the same day in 1692 when five women — sarah good, elizabeth howe, susannah martin, rebecca nurse, and sarah wildes — were hanged from a tree on the ledge. In all, 19 people would be hanged in salem. The site gets its name from the local proctor family. Wealthy landowner john proctor became a victim of the historic hysteria after he condemned the witch trials and was hanged himself. His grandson, well aware of the site's history, later bought the land. Today, especially around halloween, tourists flock to salem to indulge in \" ghost tours \" and visit sites like the witch house, where some of the trials took place. Salem is also now home to many practitioners of the wiccan faith. Volunteers were cleaning up the site this weekend ahead of the ceremony, notes a post at patch.com.

        "summary": "A somewhat ominous tweet from the weather channel on wednesday evening offered fair warning about a returning winter phenomenon. Showing frigid temperatures dipping into the teens, single digits, and even minuses in some parts of the country, the tweet read: \" no, these are not forecast low temperatures. These are high temperatures for the second half of next week. \" nbc news explains that while some parts of the rockies and plains have already been slammed with an arctic blast — and with forecasts showing possible freezing temps in parts of all 50 states saturday morning, per twc — a polar vortex may make things even crisper late next week. \" it's going to be a shock, \" a twc senior meteorologist says. \" the fall was closest to the warmest on record, so this is really back to reality. \" twc explains the polar vortex as a stratospheric \" closed circulation \" system that hovers over the polar regions. When parts of the vortex get weak or stretch out, however, that biting cold can stretch down and out. What this could mean: temperatures in the 20s in the south, in the teens throughout the northeast, and below zero in certain parts of the midwest, including chicago and minneapolis. How cold things will get and in what regions depends on how far out the polar vortex reaches. Although a weatherbell analytics meteorologist tweeted tuesday that this \" upper-level atmosphere configuration \" is \" very similar in scale &amp; magnitude \" as the \" life-threatening \" 2014 polar vortex, the washington post speculates this one won't be as bad due to the fact that it's happening earlier in the season and there's not as much snow on the ground yet to help keep air masses frosty-cold.",

That's one common take in the wake of the newly released \" this is america \" music video by actor donald glover, though under his musical alias, childish gambino. See it for yourself here. Glover premiered the song this weekend while hosting saturday night live and doubling as the musical guest, but it was the video version released afterward that has caused such a ruckus. Some takes on the video, which has gun violence as its major theme: guns: at various, startling points, glover executes a hooded prisoner and guns down a church choir. Afterward, he places the guns on a red cloth held by someone else. \" murders occur, but the guns are treated more delicately than human lives in the video — a strong statement given the current debate over gun control, \" writes lisa respers france at cnn. The dancing: the video features 10 popular dances, both old and new, by the count of adrienne gibbs at forbes. The dancers perform them flawlessly despite the bedlam behind them, opening this up to a few interpretations. \" one, they are clueless and dancing, \" she writes. \" two, they have a clue and dance to keep from crying. Three, they are jamming for the camera or for social media video and know their dancing is a distraction, a salve, or an invisibility cloak. \" or maybe all of the above, she adds. Those phones: mashable rounds up other nuggets: no, that's not trayvon martin's dad playing guitar, despite speculation on social media; the choir might represent those shot in a south carolina church; sza makes a cameo, hinting at a future collaboration; and the scene of young people filming with their phones might be a reference to the fatal police shooting of stephon clark, based on the accompanying lyric of \" this a celly / that's a tool, \" writes martha tesema.",

Burning man co-founder crimson rose says it's still not known whether mitchell intentionally ran into the fire after breaking through two layers of security or whether he accidentally fell into it as security chased after him. Toxicology tests are pending, but officials have said mitchell was not drunk; authorities are investigating the death. \" we don't know if it was intentional on his part or if it was just kind of induced by drugs, \" said nevada's pershing county sheriff jerry allen.

The bureau of land management ( which manages the land the festival is held on ) wanted festival organizers to cancel the temple burn that serves as the 9-day festival's closer, but it went ahead following the addition of more than 600 security guards and volunteers and the erection of a security fence.",

        "summary": "The white house had been kicking around the idea of requesting $ 2 billion to deal with the unprecedented wave of underage immigrants arriving from central america. Today, in a sign of just how fast the crisis is escalating, it made a formal request to congress for nearly twice that amount, reports the washington post. The $ 3.7 billion would be divvied up among various agencies with a two-pronged goal: to speed up the deportation process while making sure that the kids get adequate health care in detention centers in the interim. Among other things, the money would be used to send more immigration judges to the border, build more holding centers, and beef up border-security patrols. More than 50,000 unaccompanied minors and about 40,000 women with children have been caught on the border this year, mostly in texas, far more than any other year. The white house said yesterday that most would not be allowed to stay, reports the hill. Congress must approve the money, and a spokesperson for john boehner suggested that it wouldn't be a quick vote. \" the speaker still supports deploying the national guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas, which this proposal does not address, \" he said. The request — see the white house fact sheet here — comes as president obama prepares to head to texas. He won't visit the border, reports the new york times, but he will now apparently meet with gov. Rick perry to discuss the situation. ( meanwhile, the un wants the us to treat central americans as refugees. )",

        "summary": "As fans around the world mourn their dearly beloved prince, much about his shocking death at the age of 57 is still unknown. No cause of death has been established. An autopsy will be performed on friday, though the results could take days, the ap reports. Carver county sheriff jim olson says the star was found unresponsive in an elevator in his paisley park compound in suburban minneapolis after a 911 call thursday morning. He was pronounced dead at 10: 07am after medics were unable to revive him with cpr. A roundup of coverage: usa today has a transcript of the 911 call placed at 9: 43am. \" the person is dead here, \" says the unidentified male caller, who is at first only able to give the address as \" prince's house. \" \" yes, it's prince, \" he says later in the call when asked if he is with the person. Prince had been suffering from the flu for weeks, causing him to cancel two concerts in atlanta earlier this month, according to aides. Forbes looks at how it's possible for the flu to kill an otherwise healthy man of prince's age. The star tribune has a timeline of prince's final days, including april 15, when he was rushed to the hospital after his plane made an emergency landing in illinois. He was well enough to attend a concert by jazz/soul singer lizz wright on tuesday night. Tmz, citing anonymous sources, reports that prince was treated not for the flu, but for an overdose of opiates after the emergency landing in illinois. The sources say doctors wanted him to stay in the hospital for 24 hours, but he left within three hours after he couldn't get a private room. The new york times speaks to people who saw prince in his final days around minneapolis and at a party he hosted at his paisley park compound on saturday night. He was in a good mood but \" a little more weak, a little more pale than when i had seen him before, \" says one of the hundreds of fans who attended. \" wait a few days before you waste any prayers, \" prince told fans, warning them not to trust the media.

Macron will be hosting a global \" peace conference \" in paris on sunday that will include trump and russian president vladimir putin, among other top leaders, and he's expected to keep cautioning against what he calls the \" leprosy \" of nationalism — especially when compared to the past. \" i am struck by similarities between the times we live in and those between the two world wars, \" he told local media. The bbc, meanwhile, doesn't know if this idea will ever fly, noting that \" there is no evidence that any group of european countries has the political will or economic muscle to spend sufficiently on defense to make up for the united states ' raw power. \" ( macron has had some bodyguard issues. )",

        "summary": "A small new study offers an intriguing clue about the baffling ailment known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Researchers in the uk say cfs, also known by its more scientific name of myalgic encephalomyelitis, appears to be triggered by an overactive immune system, reports the guardian. Those who have cfs — including seabiscuit and unbroken author laura hillenbrand — suffer not just debilitating fatigue, but headaches, nausea, vertigo, and other symptoms that leave them unable to complete even the most basic tasks. The study suggests that sufferers may have an immune system that is genetically predisposed to go into hyper-drive when a virus or infection shows up, reports cnn. When it does, the cascade of debilitating — and easily misdiagnosed — symptoms begins. If the researchers are right, it could be a big first step on a poorly understood ailment. \" this is a light in the fog, a direction of travel, \" says king's college london researcher carmine pariante, per the bbc. \" although screening is a long way off, our results are the first step in identifying those at risk and catching the illness in its crucial early stages. \" the study involved 55 people with hepatitis c who were given the standard treatment of the drug interferon-alpha. This treatment typically produces symptoms consistent with cfs, and the researchers measured levels of a protein linked to inflammation in participants ' blood before, during, and afterward. Eighteen people had a particularly strong immune reaction to the treatment — including fatigue — and they also had higher levels of the suspect protein before the treatment began.",

Years later, she visited the newberrys in the us after her own marriage broke up, and started her affair with newberry's husband. He ended up choosing her over newberry and newberry eventually married her current husband, the \" love of her life, \" who loves the brownies. The full story is worth a read.",

As politico notes, nixon is hoping to pull off an upset like that of alexandria ocasio-cortez, a fellow new yorker who stunned the political world with her congressional primary victory. But the ap reports that polls show cuomo with a comfortable lead, including one out of siena college putting him up 40 points in the final week. Nixon's camp, however, is buoyed by two new perceived missteps by the cuomo campaign, involving a controversial mailer and the opening of a new bridge, and she said wednesday that cuomo is \" running scared \" and largely avoiding the media as a result. The controversial mailer from the democratic party went out to jewish neighborhoods, misrepresenting nixon's views on israel and accusing her of being \" silent \" on anti-semitism, reports new york. The party has since called it a mistake, and while cuomo has disavowed any knowledge, the new york post reports that a close ally drafted it. On the bridge, cuomo has been accused of pressuring officials to finish a replacement for the tappan zee bridge ahead of the primary. The new span, named for his father, opened this week after the cuomo administration offered \" sweeteners, \" reports the new york times. The opening, however, had to be delayed a few days at the last minute because of safety concerns. One sour note for nixon: a fellow celeb bailed on her: \" i wanted to vote nixon, but sadly, i don't believe she would know what the heck to do, \" wrote amy schumer.",

Outlets including the chicago tribune, the washington post, the new york times, and cnn quote anonymous sources with the same general story: hastert allegedly molested a male student decades ago when he was a wrestling coach in yorkville, ill. The former student met with hastert in 2010, and hastert agreed to pay $ 3.5 million to keep the story quiet, says the fbi. Hastert is not facing any charges related to the sexual allegations because authorities can't corroborate them, reports the post. Instead, he's accused of making illegal bank withdrawals and lying to the fbi about them. \" it was sex, \" a source tells the tribune. \"it goes back a long way, \" he adds. \"it has nothing to do with public corruption or a corruption scandal. Or to his time in office. \" the man identified only as individual a in court papers \" told the f.b.i. That he had been inappropriately touched by mr. Hastert when mr.

His old school district released a statement today saying it \" has no knowledge of mr.

        "summary": "Catholic lore has it that in the depths of the winter of 1224, things looked grim for a group of monks who, trapped by snow, were starving inside a friary in southern italy. Then a knock at the door alerted the monks to a life-saving delivery: a sack of bread, emblazoned with a fleur-de-lis, symbol of the french court. The story has it that angels ferried the sack to the friary of folloni near montella, and that the sender was st. Francis of assisi, the future patron saint of animals, who was living in france. Now, researchers in denmark say they may have proved the catholic legend to be true, ibt reports. Or at least the bread part. Analysis of fragments of fabric from the sack, preserved over the centuries as a relic, reveal the fibers date to 1220 to 1295, and that they likely came in contact with bread. The friary has kept the textile for more than 700 years, using it as altar cloth before encasing the few remaining fragments in a shrine in 1732. Writing in the journal radiocarbon, the scientists say the bread likely came in contact with the fibers before they were preserved as a relic. Using carbon analysis, the team found traces of ergosterol, a steroid found in mold that could be a biomarker for baking, southern denmark university says in a news release. Lead researcher kaare lund rasmussen says \" it is possible \" the bread could have dated back to that \" cold winter's night in 1224. \" as to how the sack got there, he adds, \" this is maybe more a question of belief than science. \" ( a hawaiian curse prompts tourists to return lava rocks. )",

It boils down to this: what on earth was she doing on april 16, 2014, as a ferry carrying hundreds of young students began sinking? she did not make a public appearance until seven hours after the first news reports surfaced, and her office's claim that she was coolly keeping an eye on things and issuing orders all the while has not been widely accepted. With rumors flying, a parliamentary panel will conduct a hearing wednesday on those missing hours, reports reuters. Among those to testify will be medical staffers and a plastic surgeon, presumably to address reports that she was getting botox treatments that day. In fact, at an impeachment hearing last week, an opposition lawmaker held up photos of park's eyes before and after the day of the ferry disaster, suggesting she'd had some kind of work done. The plastic surgeon in question has long treated the now-infamous choi soon-sil, who has come under fire for her controversial ties to park, reports the korea times. Also not helping: reports that park spent 90 minutes of those seven hours with a hairdresser. ( park's office has said it was a mere 20 minutes. ) and finally, park has had to deny rumors that she was taking part in some kind of ritual marking the death of choi soon-sil's father. While park has been impeached, she retains her title and salary while the matter is considered by the korean constitutional court, notes the washington post.

        "summary": "The world was shocked by the august 2014 death of robin williams, but \" middle-aged men in despair \" may have taken his suicide especially hard, reuters notes. For a study published wednesday in plos one, researchers sifted through cdc data from 1999 through 2015 and found that there was a \" marked increase \" in the number of suicides from right after williams'death through the end of 2014, and that the monthly number of suicides continued to rise throughout 2015 as well. There were 18,690 suicides from august 2014 to december 2014, which the scientists say was a nearly 10 % increase from the expected number based on data extrapolations. Among individuals ages 30 to 44, the spike was even greater during that period — about 13 % — and there was a 32 % increase in suicides by suffocation, which is how williams died ( he asphyxiated after hanging himself ). The study admits it can't prove williams'death was the direct cause of any \" copycat \" suicides — there may have been other contributing factors or misclassifications — but it says his death, and the accompanying media coverage, \" might have provided the necessary stimulus for high-risk segments of the u.s. Population … to move from suicidal ideation to attempt. \" the study notes suicides within the general population often spike after a celebrity suicide, but headlines on williams were particularly prevalent, and social media ( which wasn't a force when, say, kurt cobain died in 1994 ) may have exacerbated the exposure. The study says the effects of celebrity suicides are concerning enough that the world health organization has put out guidance for journalists on responsibly reporting high-profile deaths such as williams '.

Reuters/fred prouser los angeles ( reuters ) - suicide rates in the united states spiked almost 10 percent following the death in 2014 of actor robin williams, and spiked even more among men and those who ended their lives, like williams, by suffocation, according to a study published on wednesday. The study, published in the scientific journal plos one, found that in the five months from august to december 2014 some 18,690 deaths by suicide were recorded - an increase of 9.85 percent from the expected number of cases for the period. Williams, the oscar-winning star of \"good morning, vietnam \" who was beloved for his humor, died in august 2014 at age 63 in a suicide that shocked fans worldwide. Authorities said he died of asphyxia after hanging himself at his home in northern california.

A super pac that supports president trump unleashed the campaign against republican dean heller of nevada after he announced that he opposed the measure, reports the las vegas review-journal. The ads from america first policies were unleashed with the permission of the white house, reports the new york times, which says that mitch mcconnell called trump's chief of staff, reince priebus, over the weekend to complain that they were \" beyond stupid \" on two fronts: they were hurting mcconnell's ability to negotiate a deal and they made heller's seat vulnerable to democrats. The issue came up during trump's meeting with mcconnell and other senators on tuesday, and the times says the president \" laughed good-naturedly \" upon hearing the complaints and suggested he got the message. Soon after, the ads were pulled. Politico reports that heller himself was among those who addressed the subject at the meeting. Later, the super pac explained that it pulled back because heller's appearance at the white house suggested he was open to negotiating. Abc news notes that the campaign was the first by a pac loyal to the president against a fellow republican. Politico calls it \" stunning, \" in part because heller is viewed as one of the most vulnerable gop senators up for re-election.

Uk researchers say an enormous landslide off the coast of norway triggered a 16-foot tsunami that swamped the low-lying land mass and likely wiped out any humans, reports the bbc, which spoke to a german professor not involved in the study who called doggerland \" paradise... In mesolithic times. \" rising sea levels had been encroaching on the area over the course of thousands of years, and the tsunami may have been the death blow. Doggerland is now beneath the waves entirely, notes the huffington post. \" it was abandoned by mesolithic tribes about 8,000 years ago, which is when the storegga slide happened, \" says one of the imperial college london researchers. While fishing boats in the north sea routinely pull up artifacts of prehistoric life, archeologists have been unable to find signs of doggerland humans from after the landslide. \" it is therefore plausible that the storegga slide was indeed the cause of the abandonment of doggerland in the mesolithic, \" writes the research team in the journal ocean modelling.
