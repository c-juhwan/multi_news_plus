        "summary": "Remember the botched \" restoration \" of spanish fresco ecce homo back in 2012? well, this might top it. Having stood for more than 1,000 years, matrera castle in cadiz was looking a bit worse for wear when officials decided to restore the national monument three years ago. Now, people around the world are wishing they'd left the crumbling building alone because the original walls have been shored up by not-very-ancient-looking modern walls. \" they've got builders in rather than restorers and, like we say round here, they've cocked it up, \" a local man tells spain's la sexta, per the guardian. \" what the hell have they done to matrera castle in cadiz? \" a woman adds on twitter. \" and we thought ecce homo was bad! \" a spanish cultural heritage group says the restoration is \" absolutely terrible \" and a \" heritage massacre, \" per the independent. But the architect behind the restoration says it's really not that bad. The goal was \" to structurally consolidate those elements that were at risk; to differentiate new additions from the original structure, thus avoiding the imitative reconstructions that are prohibited by law; and to recover the volume, texture and tonality that the tower would originally have had, \" he says. As for those less-than-flattering comments, \" opinions are always welcome and constructive criticism and debate are always enriching, \" he says. \" but i do think that some basic, accurate information can help avoid some of the prejudices that spring from a simple image. \" ( this scottish castle could be washed away. )",

            "The restoration of an ancient spanish castle has been mocked by locals - as conservationists declared the work a \" heritage massacre \".

After it was badly damaged by rainfall three years ago, architects set about the job of renovating the historic structure. But spaniards vented their frustration after photographs of the restored building were released, which showed new materials had been used to stabilise what remained of the original building.

Standing on the edge of a pedestrian bridge 60 feet above washington's lewis river, the 16-year-old prepared to jump as someone counted down from three, but hesitated. \" no, i won't go, \" she says in a youtube video. And then she's pushed, followed by a scream and a crash of body hitting water. \" i could've died, \" the teen tells kgw of tuesday's incident at moulton falls regional park. Instead, after she says someone swam out to save her from drowning, jordan is confined to a hospital bed for at least a couple more days with five broken ribs, a punctured lung, and air bubbles in her chest. There's also an apologetic friend in the mix: at risk of facing charges as the clark county sheriff's office investigates, \" she pretty much said that she was sorry for doing it and she wouldn't have done it if she knew the outcome, \" one of jordan's sisters tells koin. Another adds, \" you don't really play around at 60 feet. \" that's a message they hope to convey to potential jumpers. Despite a warning sign and recent injuries at the bridge — an unconscious man was pulled from the water after jumping a couple of weeks ago, per kptv — the practice is common. Indeed, several people leaped from the bridge on wednesday. But of pushing, one told kgw, \" that's a big no-no. \"",

Walker county prosecutors'did not file any charges against training center owners and famed gymnastic coaches martha and bela karolyi -- a decision blasted by a lawyer representing gymnasts sexually abused by nassar. \" placing all of the blame on usag and none on the karolyis is a whitewash, \" attorney john manly said in a statement sent to cnn. Nassar faces six counts of sexual assault of a child, each a second-degree felony, and van horn faces one count of sexual assault of a child in the second degree, prosecutors said at a friday news conference.

But prosecutors said there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the karolyis, and statutes of limitations prevented them from charging usa gymnastics officials who didn't immediately report suspected abuse to law enforcement. That angered some nassar victims who say the karolyis and usa gymnastics should be held accountable for failing to protect young athletes — some of them olympic champions — who were under their supervision. \" charging larry nassar with more crimes makes about as much sense as digging up lee harvey oswald and charging"

            "As efforts grind on to restart either american or afghan peace talks with the taliban, there is also the chance that the windfall of hostages might become chips in any potential negotiations. Afghan officials, one of whom described the abductions as \"very terrible, \" said they were worried that the hostages might be taken to pakistan, where many international terrorist groups are based. The area where the helicopter landed is less than 20 miles from the pakistani border. One senior afghan official noted that as of monday night, the afghan government was still unsure where the hostages were being held and whether they were still in afghanistan. Local officials in logar province said the taliban were moving the hostages from village to village. The taliban took responsibility for the abduction, sending out a statement to the news media on monday afternoon that used relatively restrained language that appeared to be written to sound similar to western statements, including a headline and dateline, even though some of the information was wrong, according to afghan and american officials. The headline read: \"us-nato chopper falls into hands of mujahedeen, all passengers detained. \" the taliban statement went on to claim that those captured worked for the military, although there was no indication that any of those captured were military contractors or troops.

        "summary": "Officials are investigating after a bear fell to its death from a helicopter high over the jungles of thailand last month, the independent reports. While there's some agreement on the circumstances of the asian black bear's untimely death, it's unclear exactly how the bear came to find itself on the helicopter in the first place. According to the bangkok post, the bear was found hanging around a village near khao yai national park last month. But the phuket gazette reports the bear was injured when officials found it last november. And khaosod reports the bear had spent the last decade being rehabilitated after it was found being kept as an illegal pet. Regardless, the bear found itself being transported by wildlife officials deep into khao yai. There are reports of the bear, which had been sedated, waking up in the middle of the trip and — finding itself dangling in a net attached to the helicopter — starting to panic. But an official denies the bear ever woke up. The helicopter encountered bad weather and quickly lost altitude; that's when the bear fell from the net. It appears there may have been a problem with the net itself. The secretary of the khao yai foundation wants officials to face legal action, arguing the bear should have been driven closer to where it was found and not flown deep into the jungle away from its pack. Officials say they wanted to get the bear farther away from nearby villagers and haven't had a problem with helicopters in the past.

For years, ticketmaster waited until a potential concertgoer was nearly done with purchasing a ticket before unveiling the fees, which typically add a minimum of $ 10-$ 15 to the price. Now, at least for most events, prospective buyers will see a portion of the fees as soon as they select the tickets. So, for example, let's say you want to see nick cave's grinderman at the music box @ fonda ( you should ). A drop-down menu tells you that the $ 30 is actually $ 40.30. It's not until one clicks through the site that the fees are broken down, with a $ 2.50 facility charge, which goes to the venue operator, and a $ 7.80 \" convenience charge, \" some of which goes to ticketmaster, the promoter, credit card companies and artists. Yet the actual cost of the ticket still isn't $ 40.30. The final price comes to $ 47.30, thanks to an additional \" order processing fee \" and the $ 2.50 charge to print your own ticket. All told, fees add $ 17.30 to a single $ 30 ticket. In instances where the promoter owns the venue, the latter is double-dipping of a sort. The goldenvoice-run fonda comes with a $ 2.50 faculty fee, and live nation's own palladium tacks on $ 1. Company chief irving",

        "summary": "A house conservative who isn't exactly a household name made a surprise move today to try to oust john boehner as speaker. The long-shot \" vacate the chair \" resolution comes from north carolina republican mark meadows, and the washington post reports that it's been tried only once before — 105 years ago — when it failed. Among other things, meadows argues in his resolution that boehner uses his speakership to punish those who vote against him. \"it's really more about trying to have a conversation on making this place work, where everybody's voice matters, where there's not a punitive culture, \" says meadows. He tells politico he's more interested in forcing a \" discussion \" than in an actual vote against boehner. His resolution now goes to the rules committee, where the hill notes that chairman pete sessions, a boehner ally, could ignore it. Even so, the move comes just ahead of a six-week recess, virtually guaranteeing that house republicans will be questioned about it over the break. If it does come to a vote, democrats would have to join house conservatives in ousting boehner, another long-shot. \" my guess is, he's probably in trouble in his district so he needs a way to raise money, \" says another boehner ally, devin nunes, who dismissed it as a \" gimmick. \" boehner's office has not commented.",

Wuhayshi, who was reportedly groomed by osama bin laden, became al-qaeda's no. 2 leader when he took charge of the highly active — and dangerous — yemen franchise in 2013. He was filmed calling for attacks on the us at a large gathering of militants last year. \" we must eliminate the cross, \" he said, and \" the bearer of the cross is america. \" the site intelligence group describes the death as the biggest strike on al-qaeda since the 2011 killing of bin laden, the bbc reports.

( ditto for dan rowinski at readwriteweb. ) one big caveat is that the mcafee report doesn't say \" precisely what information was stolen from the targeted organizations, and how many computers at each business were affected, \" writes cluley. It's tough to call it the \" biggest hack ever \" without knowing that. As for blaming china: probably not a bad bet, but what government isn't spying via the internet? both bloggers note that mcafee released its report just in time to grab headlines as the blackhat security conference gets under way in vegas. But even if operation shady rat is a bit over-hyped, it still offers security lessons to organizations, adds cluley. As arik hesseldahl at allthingsd writes, \" how did these attacks happen? it's very simple: someone at the target organization received an email that looked legitimate, but which contained an attachment that wasn't. \"",

Currently, seven women have defamation suits pending in massachusetts, while three more have defamation or sexual battery suits pending in california. Cosby has denied any wrongdoing. The criminal case against cosby partly stems from the accuser's related lawsuit. Prosecutors reopened a criminal investigation and filed charges in 2015 after cosby's deposition in the woman's 2005 lawsuit was unsealed, and they realized the 12-year statute of limitations for felony sexual assault had not yet expired.

Kerry added that he thought assad \" isn't about to do it, \" but lavrov, who just wrapped a round of talks in moscow with his syrian counterpart walid al-moallem, said that moscow would try to convince the syrians. \" if the establishment of international control over chemical weapons in that country would allow avoiding strikes, we will immediately start working with damascus, \" lavrov said. \" we are calling on the syrian leadership to not"

That's thanks in large part to social reactor, a service that pairs advertisers with social media figures like sanchez. Business insider reports he makes one to three cents per click he gets on said advertiser's link ( these tweets aren't branded any differently than his other uberfacts ). The 23-year-old started the account, which is now also a popular app, for two reasons: as a way to \" kill time \" in college, and to be closer to britney spears, he says. He joined twitter to follow the singer ( who hasn't followed him ), he tells fast company, but found himself unsure of what to tweet about. Tweeting facts seemed as good an ideas as any. After dropping out of college, sanchez held onto uberfacts as a side project, and it eventually became a real job, and a company with three employees. But it hasn't been without its hurdles: uberfacts has gotten a fair bit of attention for \" facts \" that may not be quite true — they're tweeted as statements with no link to the source material ( the uber facts site recommends you consult the \" google machine \" for answers to any questions ). Earlier this year, buzzfeed cited some \" delightful \" but inaccurate \" facts \" it ran: the uberfact that there's a bridge in paris made solely of trampolines, for instance, was sadly just a concept.

        "summary": "\" anybody ( especially fake news media ) who thinks that repeal &amp; replace of obamacare is dead does not know the love and strength in r party! \" so proclaimed president trump on twitter on sunday, and it wasn't an idle tweet. The ap reports that vice president mike pence and two senior white house officials offered up a carrot in a closed-door meeting monday night with their biggest gop foe on the issue, the house freedom caucus. They reportedly offered the ability for states to apply for waivers to two obamacare coverage requirements: \" essential health benefits, \" which mandates coverage in 10 categories, like prescription drugs and maternity care; and \" community rating, \" which forces plans to charge all members of an age group the same price. Doing away with those essentially means eliminating the pre-existing condition safeguards, an obamacare tenet that trump has until now promised to maintain. The new york times gives a hypothetical that clearly illustrates the potential impact: \" technically, the deal would still prevent insurers from denying coverage to people with a history of illness. But without community rating, health plans would be free to charge those patients as much as they wanted. If both of the obamacare provisions went away, the hypothetical cancer patient might be able to buy only a plan, without chemotherapy coverage, that costs many times more than a similar plan costs a healthy customer. Only cancer patients with extraordinary financial resources and little interest in the fine print would sign up. \" the freedom caucus expects to get the offer in writing tuesday, and caucus head rep. Mark meadows responded favorably to it in comments to the times. As for why conservatives are gunning for such changes, the paper explains that it could make premiums for healthy americans much cheaper, while potentially forcing those with pre-existing conditions back into \" high-risk pools. \"",

            "But insurance in the old high-risk pools tended to be expensive, and often came with long waiting periods or benefit limitations, even for the very sick. The main difference between the policy environment in 2009 and today is that the federal government would now be offering tax credits to help healthy people buy what would probably be relatively skimpy plans. That would mean that more middle-income americans would probably have health coverage than before the affordable care act, since the combination of policies would tend to make insurance much more affordable for people who are young and healthy. What states would choose to do with this set of options is hard to predict. Before obamacare, few states required community rating of health plans. And few states required insurers to cover all of the benefits deemed essential under obamacare, though most did require a few types of treatments to be covered. State governments would face a difficult choice: either take away the requirements, and leave sick patients without insurance options, or keep them and see people unable to afford coverage under the new subsidy system. Under obamacare, states can already waive many of the law's insurance rules if they can show that an alternative program would cover as many people with comprehensive coverage at a lower cost to the government. But that standard is difficult to meet. Mr. Meadows has suggested"

At age 41, revere was a prosperous, established and prominent boston silversmith. He had helped organize an intelligence and alarm system to keep watch on the british military. Revere later served as a massachusetts militia officer, though his service ended after the penobscot expedition, one of the most disastrous campaigns of the american revolutionary war, for which he was absolved of blame. Following the war, revere returned to his silversmith trade.

Aircraft killed at least four militants in pakistan on wednesday, officials said, ending an eight-week pause in the use of a tactic that has become a mainstay of the fight against insurgents. Drone attacks have been used increasingly in recent years in the fight against insurgents in pakistan's largely lawless pashtun tribal areas in the west and northwest who fuel violence across the border in afghanistan. Pakistani security and intelligence officials said the missiles hit a home on the outskirts of the town of miranshah in north waziristan, killing at least four militants. Insurgents often dispute official versions of such attacks and the death tolls involved. The strike was the first such attack since november 17 and could deepen anti-u.s. Sentiment in pakistan, which was already running high after a november 26 cross-border nato air attack that inadvertently killed 24 pakistani soldiers. \" i think we were expecting the drone strikes after a long break, \" said amir rana, director of the pakistan institute for peace studies. \" there were even a few reports were coming from the last two, three days that they are going to be resumed. \" the november 26 air strike triggered a deep chill in already troubled u.s.-pakistan relations, prompting pakistan to close off nato supply routes into afghanistan.

The attack tuesday took place in north waziristan, an al-qaida and taliban stronghold close to the afghan border that has been pounded by u.s. Strikes, the officials said. Three of the dead were arab fighters, said the officials, who didn't give their names because they were not allowed to be named in the media.

American officials say there had been no promise by washington to avoid drone operations since the deadly nov. 26 airstrikes along the afghan border, but that the lull was part efforts to tamp down tensions with pakistan, seen by many u.s.

Seeing the toll cancer and treatment had taking on david's life, the spisaks decided to give their son a \" slice of life. \" \" we just decided it was time to give him a childhood, \" david's mom, amber spisak, told abc news. \"if the outcome was going to be the same, if he was going to continue to get cancer, we decided that if he wasn't going to win, that we would give him everything right now. \" she also wrote in a fundraising campaign set for david online, \" no more isolation from people or places, restrictions, living in hospitals; only swimming pools, going places, fun, playing with other kids, going hard and fast"

She is so disabled that her mother considers her \" unabled. \" at 10, her brain is believed to function at the level of a newborn's. She cannot speak, cannot walk, cannot see anything beyond light and dark and perhaps the shadowy shape of a face held inches away. As her body grew, her parents feared her world would grow smaller. How would they lift her or get her out of the house? they saw for charley a grim future of hoists and machinery, of isolation and loneliness, of days spent trapped in bed, staring up at a ceiling she couldn't see. So jenn and mark hooper came up with a radical solution: they gave their daughter hormones to stop her growth. Then they had doctors remove her womb to spare her the pain of menstruation. Charley is now around 4-foot-3 and 53 pounds and will remain so for the rest of her life. \" we didn't do this to charley, we did it for charley, \" her mom has said, per tvnz. Such treatment is known as the \" ashley treatment, \" after a girl in seattle who had it in 2006.",

The group took the \" unprecedented \" step of moving the clock 30 seconds closer to midnight, to leave it at 2 1/2 minutes away. The setting is the closest the symbolic clock has come to midnight since 1953, when scientists moved it to two minutes from midnight after seeing both the u.s. And the soviet union test hydrogen bombs. It remained at that mark until 1960. \" make no mistake, this has been a difficult year, \" rachel bronson, executive director and publisher of the bulletin of the atomic scientists, said as the new setting was announced thursday.

The group, which surveyed 10,000 populations of more than 3,000 species, says marine life — including mammals and birds as well as fish — has declined by 49 % between 1970 and 2012, the bbc reports. The wwf says humans have caused the decline in marine species through overfishing, destruction of habitats like seagrass beds and mangrove swamps, and through climate change, which has caused ocean acidification. Experts warn the latter could cause a \" great dying \" even worse than what has taken place over the last few decades. Some of the steepest declines were among fish caught for food, including tuna and mackerel, which are down almost 75 %, the bbc reports. \" in less than a human generation, we can see dramatic losses in ocean wildlife — they have declined by half — and their habitats have been degraded and destroyed, \" a wwf spokesman tells discovery. \" driving all these trends are human actions: from overfishing and resource depletion, to coastal development and pollution, to the greenhouse gas emissions causing ocean acidification and warming. \" not as much is known about deep-sea populations, though declining catches suggest they're also dropping fast, the independent reports.

The syrian army answered the rebels ' gunfire. Tanks fired into the village from one direction, artillery from another. The ground shook. Smoke and dust rose. Defenseless against the exploding artillery rounds, the rebels kept firing, and were not driven off. As spring arrives in syria, the civil war closes out its second year in a mosaic of vicious and widely scattered battles, like this one, where the damascus-aleppo highway crosses an open agricultural plain in the south of idlib province. Since late last spring, antigovernment fighters have wrested much of northern syria from mr. Assad's control, overrunning military checkpoints and several bases, and pushing the army back. But the rebel tide, largely led in northwestern syria by islamic groups, moves slowly, checked by weapon shortages and by a lingering archipelago of government positions where the army and loyalist militias have settled in with powerful weapons, equipped for a long fight."

Bloomberg reports vw engineer james liang pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud on friday. Liang, a german citizen, has worked for vw since 1983, first in germany and then in the us, according to wdiv. He allegedly led the team of engineers that developed a \" defeat device \" for the company's diesel vehicles. That device allowed vw vehicles to pass emissions tests while emitting nitrogen oxide at rates 40 times what is allowed by the epa when actually on the road. Authorities say the defeat device was developed by liang and his team in 2006 in germany and that liang was testing the device in california in 2014 and 2015. Liang faces up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine, cnbc reports. As part of his plea agreement, liang will be cooperating with investigators, something that could reduce his sentence. Liang's attorney says the 62-year-old engineer is \" very remorseful for what occurred. \" liang is scheduled to be sentenced in january.

His lawyer said that liang was \"one of many at volkswagen \" involved in the scheme.

            "The controversy over an anti-islam film made in the us continued to fuel protests and extreme reactions in the muslim world. Scores of people were injured on saturday in a clash in bangladesh's capital, dhaka, between police and hundreds of demonstrators.

            "The libyan city of benghazi was tense after the bodies of six militiamen apparently executed after the storming of a base on the southern outskirts were discovered in a field. The bodies were found the day after crowds marched on three militia bases, including that of ansar al-sharia, blamed by many in the city for the murder of the us ambassador, chris stevens, earlier this month. Funerals were held for nine protesters killed when crowds tried to force their way into the rafallah al-sahati militia base early on saturday morning. The militia was the only one of three to fire back when demonstrators swarmed over their bases, following a rally on friday in which 30,000 people vowed to retake the streets of the city. The interior minister, fawzi abdul al, who was criticised for his failure to launch a full investigation of the murder of stevens and three fellow diplomats, criticised the action of the crowds, saying the militias should have been given more time to incorporate into the official security forces. The mood in benghazi is one of both triumph and sorrow at the toll of dead and wounded. Mohammed el kish, whose cousin was killed by a stray bullet more than a mile from the clashes, said: \" he was not even involved in the actions, it is terrible. \" city hospitals were braced for more violence after"

The law was set to go into effect at the beginning of august but the judge granted the temporary injunction after the state's only abortion clinic filed a lawsuit. Fetal heartbeats can be detected as early as six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. The red river women's clinic says the ban will put it out of business by outlawing 90 % of the abortions it performs, reuters reports. The lawsuit argues the ban is unconstitutional and will put women's health at risk. If red river closes, women will have to travel about 250 miles to neighboring states to have the procedure. \" the united states supreme court has unequivocally said that no state may deprive a woman of the choice to terminate her pregnancy at a point prior to viability, \" the judge wrote in his ruling, per the washington post.

In this july 25, 2010 file photo, alberto contador of spain speeds down the champs elysees during the 20th and last stage of the tour de france cycling race in paris, france. Spaniards on thursday debated whether to condemn or defend their three-time tour de france champion alberto contador after news filtered in that the country's cycling federation would likely suspend the cyclist for one year. It is a decision that would cost him his 2010 title. Some saw it as a mere slap on the wrist. Others saw it as overly harsh. Mr. Contador, who tested positive for minute traces of the banned performance-enhancing substance clenbuterol during a rest day in the last edition of the french competition, would be spared a heavy financial fine with the one-year suspension, but would miss most of the 2011 season. The spanish federation on wednesday privately told its preliminary decision to contador and the international cycling union ( uci ), which had already provisionally suspended contador last year.

Although admitting that contador had been informed of the rfec's recommendation, federation president juan carlos castano said: \"nothing has been told to anyone who is not the rider and in any case this is not the definitive decision. The definitive one will be made public in 10 days and not before and at no time can the media know the proposal because it is completely secret. \" the spaniard, who has vehemently protested his innocence from the outset, claiming that the positive test was the result of eating contaminated meat, has 10 days to appeal.

The rfec decision was not meant to have been broadcast until thursday but with the spanish press rife with rumour, contador was told of the decision on wednesday.

Cheese is a lot cheaper in the us than it is in canada, and officials believe the trio bought at least $ 200,000 worth of the american stuff and sold it to canadian pizzerias and other restaurants for a profit of $ 165,000, the toronto sun reports. The men have been charged with conspiracy, smuggling, and other violations of customs law. Smugglers bringing cases of cheese across the border can make up to $ 2,000 a trip if they can find a buyer, reports the cbc. \" we get all our stuff legit, \" says one pizzeria owner who was questioned by police. \" we thought it was a joke at first.

            "It is a truth universally acknowledged that every young lady interested in literature goes through a phase where she finds terribly pretentious young men terribly attractive. She is so wowed by his deep knowledge of the western canon — and more of a turn-on still, his ability to deconstruct it — that she ignores the fact that every discussion of the great existential questions ends up being, basically, all about him and his superior philosophical mind and how he is on a higher plane than everyone else because he really thinks about this stuff, you know? when he asks for her opinion on literature, it is often done with a slightly patronizing whiff. Yet she hangs on his musings and his attentions. She treasures his missives — until some day, years in the future, she comes across the old correspondence she saves and is able to laugh at how silly and self-serious they both were in their youth. That's probably what alex mcnear, an occidental college student in the eighties with an interest in postmodern literary criticism, thought when she stumbled on this solipsistic little stem-winder from her old college boyfriend, right?",

        "summary": "President obama is acting to ensure overtime for millions of workers who may currently be working the hours without getting the pay. As it stands, workers ranging from fast-food managers to computer experts may be labeled \" executive or professional \" by their employers; that designation lets their bosses avoid paying them overtime, the new york times explains. Obama's new rules, which will face public comment before being finalized, would change that. \" under current rules … you can spend 95 % of the time sweeping floors and stocking shelves, and if you're responsible for supervising people 5 % of the time, you can then be considered executive and be exempt, \" says a liberal think tank rep. Right now, some salaried workers may not be eligible for overtime if they make more than $ 455 per week, or some $ 24,000 per year, the wall street journal notes. That level was set in 2004, and experts note that inflation has rendered it even less effective. Obama looks likely to raise that threshold to an amount that's not yet clear, though a recent paper suggested $ 984 per week, or about $ 50,000 yearly. Conservatives are opposed to the move, with one telling the times it could ultimately result in job cuts: \" if they push through something to make a certain class of workers more expensive, something will happen to adjust. \"",

            "Throop — a 74-year-old scranton man died monday when a headstone fell on him while he and his wife were visiting a relative's grave at st. Joseph's cemetery. Stephen and lucy woytack were attaching a religious ornament to the stone when it toppled, pinning mr. Woytack underneath, according to lackawanna county coroner tim rowland. The warmer weather \"made the terrain, monument and its base unstable, \" mr. Rowland said in an emailed press release monday. The coroner listed the manner of death as accidental. \"it happened so quickly, \" said mrs. Woytack, his wife of 46 years. She described her husband as a kind and loving man who was very involved with the church, she said. He served as a eucharistic minister at mary, mother of god parish in scranton, which oversees the cemetery. \"he would never hesitate to help someone else, \" mrs. Woytack said. For years, cemetery caretaker ed kubilus saw the woytacks when they visited the gravesite, and he said he knew mr. Woytack well. After the stone fell on her husband, mrs. Woytack found mr. Kubilus on the other side of the cemetery. He called police and rushed to the gravesite, where he tried to lift the 300- to 400-pound granite block, but couldn't. Police arrived a few minutes later, but by then",

Kozlowski, who sued the wayne county sheriff's department on nov. 28 with backing from the equal employment opportunity commission, not only accuses the sheriff's office of sexual harassment, but also gender discrimination and retaliation related to his complaint.

So say researchers inspecting 2,905 burials at the greek colony of kamarina in southeastern sicily. Writing in the journal popular archaeology, university of pittsburgh archaeologist carrie sulosky weaver says they've unearthed quite a bit of evidence suggesting that, at least from the 5th through 3rd centuries bc, the ancient greeks were inclined to believe that the dead could rise from the grave, and they'd use various methods ( like burying the dead under stones ) to try to keep them in place and others ( like leaving spells and potions in the form of katadesmoi, or tablets ) to invoke them. \" tablets contained petitions that were addressed to underworld deities who would command the spirits of the dead to fulfill the request of the petitioner, \" sulosky weaver tells discovery news. Of the thousands of burials, roughly half of which contained items like terracotta vases and figurines, two were of particular interest: tomb 653, whose occupant was buried covered in fragments of amphora ( two-handled vessels for storing wine ), and tomb 693, whose pre-teen occupant was buried beneath five large stones that appear to be pinning it down. All suggest that necrophobia, or fear of the dead, dates back at least 7,000 years. ( cornell researchers say this is the safest place to hide from zombies. )",
