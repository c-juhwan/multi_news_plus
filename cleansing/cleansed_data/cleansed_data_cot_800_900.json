With such notices, people can generally travel throughout the us without being detained again. Vargas, who revealed his undocumented status in a 2011 essay, was at the border with mexico to support child migrants; after arriving, he learned that he was in a specially-patrolled area and may not be allowed out without documentation, business insider reports. \" i didn't realize just how much a militarized zone the texas border is, \" vargas told the dallas morning news on sunday.

        "summary": "Russian president vladimir putin on monday criticized soviet founder vladimir lenin, accusing him of placing a \" time bomb \" under the state and sharply denouncing brutal repressions by the bolshevik government. The harsh criticism of lenin, who's still revered by communists and many others in russia, is unusual ( though not unheard of ) for putin, who in the past carefully weighed his comments about the nation's history to avoid alienating some voters. Putin's assessment of lenin's role in russian history during monday's meeting with pro-kremlin activists in stavropol follows on attacks last week on the anniversary of lenin's death, notes newsweek. He denounced lenin and his government for brutally executing russia's last czar along with his family and servants, killing thousands of priests, and placing a \" time bomb \" under the russian state by drawing administrative borders along ethnic lines. As an example of lenin's destructive legacy, putin pointed at donbass, the industrial region in eastern ukraine where a pro-russia separatist rebellion flared up weeks after russia's march 2014 annexation of ukraine's crimean peninsula. He said that lenin and his government whimsically drew borders between parts of the ussr, placing donbass under ukrainian jurisdiction in order to \" increase the percentage of proletariat \" in a move putin called \" delirious. \" putin also blasted the bolsheviks for losing world war i in their quest for power. Putin's recent criticism of lenin could be part of his attempts to justify moscow's policy in the ukrainian crisis, but it also may reflect the kremlin's concern about possible separatist sentiments in some russian provinces. Despite his remarks, putin signaled that the government has no intention of taking lenin's body out of his red square tomb, warning against \" any steps that would divide the society. \"",

        "summary": "A spokesman for the bay area contractor that built the berkeley apartments where a balcony collapsed tuesday, killing six, says the company has \" a very good reputation \" and has \" never had an incident like this before, \" but a series of recent lawsuits suggests otherwise, the san francisco chronicle reports. Segue construction paid out $ 3 million in 2014 in a settlement dealing with \" water penetration \" issues on balconies in a san jose apartment complex, the paper notes — issues that segue blamed on a subcontractor before settling. Segue spokesman sam singer tells the chronicle the san jose balconies were \" substantially different \" in design from the berkeley balcony. But a second suit segue settled in 2013 ended with a $ 3.5 million payout to the owners of a millbrae condo complex, with a lawyer for the plaintiffs telling the paper \" water got into the structural wood framing for the balconies and dry-rotted out the wood members, \" as suspected in the berkeley collapse. And berkleyside.com has uncovered yet another lawsuit, still in litigation, accusing segue of \" water intrusion causing tangible property damage \" in colma, though balconies weren't specifically mentioned. The website also details $ 11,000 in osha fines segue has racked up since 2006 for work-site safety violations; singer says the fines were \" pretty minimal \" considering how much work segue has done over the years. But back in berkeley, singer tells the chronicle building maintenance needs priority, and berkeley mayor tom bates says state balcony codes may need to be scrutinized. Meanwhile, hundreds attended a mass and separate candlelight vigil for the victims last night, and pointing fingers wasn't on the agenda. \" we may...

Berkeley mayor tom bates said there was \"high probability \" that water had penetrated and rotted the wooden underpinnings of the balcony that broke away early tuesday in downtown berkeley during a 21st birthday party for an irish student visiting the bay area for the summer. Officials ordered a second balcony removed from the same building wednesday because it was \"structurally unsafe, \" and bates said its problems were similar to those suspected in the collapse. Court documents show that segue construction inc., the pleasanton company that built the library gardens apartment complex at 2020 kittredge st., site of tuesday's tragedy, has paid $ 6.5 million since 2013 to settle a pair of lawsuits alleging problems like those apparently at the center of the berkeley probe.

But sam singer, a spokesman for pleasanton-based segue construction inc., said wednesday that the company has a long track record of safety and quality, and that lawsuits are \"commonplace \" in the construction industry. Read complete balcony collapse coverage on berkeleyside. Singer also said safety-related fines assessed of segue have been minimal, and that the company has been sued just once in relation to balcony work and water issues. That lawsuit, which related to a san jose apartment complex, involved balconies singer described as very different in design from the berkeley balcony, at the 176-unit library gardens apartment complex, that collapsed tuesday, with deadly consequences. Segue reportedly settled that case for $ 3",
            "Builder of berkeley apartments has paid millions in balcony suits the investigation into the cause of the berkeley apartment balcony collapse that killed six people and injured seven focused wednesday on the company that constructed the building — a firm that has paid more than $ 6 million in the past two years to settle lawsuits claiming its work caused balconies to rot prematurely and fail. Berkeley mayor tom bates said there was \"high probability \" that water had penetrated and rotted the wooden underpinnings of the balcony that broke away early tuesday in downtown berkeley during a 21st birthday party for an irish student visiting the bay area for the summer. Officials ordered a second balcony removed from the same building wednesday because it was \"structurally unsafe, \" and bates said its problems were similar to those suspected in the collapse. Court documents show that segue construction inc., the pleasanton company that built the library gardens apartment complex at 2020 kittredge st., site of tuesday's tragedy, has paid $ 6.5 million since 2013 to settle a pair of lawsuits alleging problems like those apparently at the center of the berkeley probe. Bates said city investigators have not completed their work on the collapse, which killed five irish nationals and a woman from rohnert park who held dual u.s.-irish citizenship. \"we are waiting for the real report, \" bates said in an interview. \"i am not"

An existing theory holds that the spot is the result of chemicals underneath the planet's clouds. But following the new research, experts say that the sun is responsible for the color: sunlight may break up chemicals in jupiter's atmosphere, phys.org reports. Scientists in pasadena, calif., came to the conclusion after re-creating the effects at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory. They were able to get a spot-like red effect by directing ultraviolet light at ammonia and acetylene, gases that are both found on the planet. Their new theory: \" most of the great red spot is actually pretty bland in color, beneath the upper cloud layer of reddish material, \" says a researcher. \" under the reddish'sunburn'the clouds are probably whitish or grayish. \" so why is it confined to just one spot? \" the great red spot … reaches much higher altitudes than clouds elsewhere on jupiter, \" the expert notes. The spot is actually a storm with winds of up to hundreds of miles per hour, the daily mail reports. Wind in the area brings ammonia particles higher in the atmosphere where they can be exposed to more sunlight, and a vortex keeps them there, the researchers say.

When i went looking for suits, i found plenty of cute prints and even great, green manufacturing, but few suits stood up to the ' romping in the serious ocean waves without coming off'test that i hold all my swimwear to. Until roxy. Seriously, this brand makes some amazingly well-designed bikinis and one-pieces that are great-looking, feel secure and don't come off without a fight. When i was shopping for my new bathing suits, i remember trying them out for the first time, figuring that they probably had to wear well, since the company made gear for women surfers, and i ' m guessing that connection to surfing as a sport has made their swimwear awesome. Unfortunately, though, some recent advertising by roxy flies in the face of what i thought they were about. It's all about being hot in a bikini and not about what amazing things you get to",

Here's a sampling: wall street journal: the newspaper complains that trump was \" at his worst \" when he went after dreamers in the campaign but thinks that obama was \" at his most cynical \" when he instituted daca on iffy legal grounds.

Regardless of all that, it's now up to congress to protect these young immigrants, and to do so without using them as political weapons. New york times: its editorial accuses trump of \" cowardice \" for sending jeff sessions out to do the \" dirty work \" of announcing the move and suggests trump doesn't even understand the implications of the decision. \" daca is morally right, legally sound and fiscally smart policy, \" the editors write. \" it was also the only humane choice mr. Obama had in the face of congress's failure to pass any meaningful immigration reform in the last two decades. \" national review: trump made the right move because \" daca is an extralegal amnesty at odds with our constitutional system, \" write the editors.

Trump has sapped their earnings and purchasing power, withdrawn their college prospects and imperiled their jobs, \" they write.

Economist peter navarro, a leading china hawk, has been appointed head of the white house national trade council, a move the transition team says shows trump's \" determination to make american manufacturing great again, \" the bbc reports. Navarro, 67, is a professor at the university of california-irvine. He has long warned about globalization and was an adviser to the trump campaign. The wall street journal notes that labor groups will welcome the appointment, though some economists say navarro is making elementary mistakes when he warns about china trade stifling us growth. In another controversial trump appointment wednesday, billionaire investor carl icahn was named as a special adviser on regulatory issues, which the journal notes has major implications in light of trump's promises to get rid of 90 % of federal regulations. Critics say there are clearly conflicts of interest in appointing a leading corporate investor to rewrite regulations affecting corporations, the new york times reports. \" the corrupt nature of this arrangement cannot be understated, \" a dnc spokesman said. \" voters who wanted trump to drain the swamp just got another face full of mud. \" the hill reports that the transition team says icahn will be advising \" in his individual capacity and will not be serving as a federal employee, \" meaning he will be exempt from conflict-of-interest regulations.",

But it's not just any old coin; the so-called \" big maple leaf \" canadian coin is pure 24-carat gold, big and heavy, and valued at around $ 4 million, reports the bbc. Thieves carried away the 220-pound coin, which is more than 20 inches in diameter, sometime after 2am local time, reports cnn. It has a face value of $ 1 million, and while it would make investigators ' job very easy if the crooks tried to spend it, police believe they will either melt the coin down or deliver it to a collector who hired them to steal it, the globe and mail reports. The bode museum in berlin has housed the coin in its collection since 2010, reports the cbc. First issued by the royal canadian mint in 2007 with an image of queen elizabeth ii on one side and the country's symbolic maple leaf on the other, the coin made it into the guinness book of records for its record-breaking gold purity of 99.999 %. Authorities say the coin was secured behind bullet-proof glass in the building and that the bandits appear to have entered through a window, using a ladder that they left on nearby train tracks. The original coin is in ottawa, while five others, including this one, were sold to private individuals. ( check out which day these thieves picked to pull off a jewelry heist. )",

When eating in a group, we tend to pick up on \" pacesetters \" — cues from our dining companions as to how much and how quickly we eat. Researchers found that light eaters tend to eat more in groups, while heavy eaters eat less, making solo dining more ideal for the former and group dining better for the latter. Quantity of food or pace aside, eating alone is a good way to get a reboot, a psychologist tells medical daily. \" i used to call it the steven glansberg, \" one diner tells the new york daily news, referring to a superbad character who eats lunch alone every day. \" now i realize how relaxing and enjoyable it is. \" ( now if only waiters would stop this rude practice. )",

Doctors learned that the infant carried genetic markers associated with cystic fibrosis, but he never went on to develop the disease. In fact, that test was the boy's only interaction with it — until 2012, when he was kicked out of middle school. His parents had offered up the information when they enrolled him at a school in palo alto, calif., and somehow teachers found out, reports wired. Those teachers allegedly told parents of two kids with cystic fibrosis during a parent-teacher conference, and suddenly those parents were demanding colman's removal because their own kids would be more vulnerable to infection. ( per the cystic fibrosis foundation, people with cf are known to be able to spread \" certain germs among others with the disease. \" ) it all played out a bit like the medical version of thought crime — where potential ( or in this case predisposition ) is punished — but within a few weeks the school let colman return, thanks to the family obtaining an injunctive relief; now the chadams have relocated altogether. Still, their lawsuit accusing the district of violating both the americans with disabilities act and privacy rights is still making its way through the courts, as they appealed to the us 9th circuit court of appeals last month and got some support from the doj and department of education, per this amicus curiae brief. \" the family would like a definitive and unequivocal statement from the ninth circuit that you can't just do this to people based on genetic markers alone, \" their attorney tells buzzfeed. The implications could be broad, not only regarding how genetic information can be used, but who gets to make decisions based on the resulting \" real or imagined \" safety concerns, he adds.

        "summary": "There's no denying that humans are mad for their cellphones, but some are clearly more attached than others — and scientists now have a clearer understanding of why. Generally speaking, people who constantly check their phones have a problem controlling impulses, period, and they're not so great at delayed gratification, either, reports bustle. Once a person of this nature checks their phone, it triggers the impulse to keep checking it again and again, even if the reward will be a paltry one, say psychologists henry wilmer and jason chein of temple university in a post at science daily. They drew the conclusion after putting 91 undergrads through a series of tests that measured how often they checked their phones, how well they controlled their impulses, and whether they'd prefer to receive a small amount of money immediately or a larger sum if they waited a few days to a year. Among other things, wilmer and chein found that students who were least interested in waiting for that hypothetical sum of money — in other words, they were impatient — were more likely to check their phones frequently. \" mobile technology habits, such as frequent checking, seem to be driven most strongly by uncontrolled impulses and not by the desire to pursue rewards, \" wilmer concludes in psychonomic bulletin &amp; review. A post at cosmopolitan draws a lesson from the research: \" if you're the type to never let a retweet remain un-liked or a friend request go unnoticed, take a peek at some other areas of your life, \" writes katherine schreiber. \" if you're having trouble reining in urges — to, say, eat the whole pint of ice cream, resist ordering one more round, or flip out at a coworker or friend — it may be time to take a break from your smartphone and start practicing some self-regulation. \" ( some people have \" ringxiety. \" )",

Now the kids smoking tobacco exclusively are the \" marginalized \" ones. The study found that 92 % of students who smoke cigarettes also smoke pot, but only 25 % of pot smokers also smoke tobacco. The biggest group was the 90 % who reported smoking neither, and researchers say that's the way to go. \" people dramatically underestimate the risks associated with cannabis use, particularly among youth, \" says the ut scientist.",

That lowered oxygen levels and set off altitude warnings, forcing pilots to descend immediately. Oxygen masks were also deployed during the emergency descent — photos of which later popped up on chinese social media and can be seen at australia's news network.

Researchers analyzed 730,000 iq scores of norwegian men entering the country's military draft who were born between 1962 and 1991, per sciencealert. They found that iq scores rose almost 0.3 points per year among men born between 1962 and 1975, then declined for men born after 1975. Overall there was a 7-point dip per generation, reports newsweek. And the norway study is no outlier: other studies by european and scandinavian researchers have noted a similar trend, notes cnn. The investigators believe the environment, rather than genetics, is responsible because they saw the same iq drop within families, between brothers and sons. Parental education and family size did not seem to play a role in the decline. For most of the 20th century, iq scores had been increasing, presumably because of better access to education. The researchers suggest the trend could be due to lifestyle factors, including changes in nutrition, how children are educated, media exposure, and how kids spend their free time. It's also possible that iq tests, which tend to emphasize formally taught critical thinking, simply haven't been adapted to capture changes in the ways people think. As one psychology professor told cnn: \" we need to recognize that as time changes and people are exposed to different intellectual experiences, such as changes in the use of technology, for example, social media, the way intelligence is expressed also changes. Educational methods need to adapt to such changes. \"",

That's what one hip-swirling teen learned after being caught on a video since gone viral, jamming to the hit tune from the mid- ' 90s. Saudi police said they arrested the 14-year-old on tuesday for \" improper public behavior \" after he busted a few moves to the spanish song in the middle of a jeddah intersection, reuters reports. In the 45-second clip, the ricky martin wannabe, wearing headphones, nike shorts, and crocs, performs for several lanes of cars stopped at a light. The clip first appeared online in 2016 but was later removed, the middle east eye notes, via the new york post. It reappeared last week, apparently attracting the eye of authorities. Arab news reports cops detained the boy after analyzing the video, and they ' ll decide after questioning him whether to refer the matter to prosecutors. Saudis flocked to social media to weigh in on the spectacle. While some found it \" discourteous, \" others say cops should back off. \" he is just a kid who wanted to enjoy his time. Don't make a big fuss about it, \" someone tweeted. It's not the first time a saudi singer has broken the rules in the strict religious state. Cops there this month arrested a singer for doing the \" dab \" — touching his face to his bent elbow — onstage at a music festival, per reuters. The move is banned because it's said to encourage drug use. ( saudi cops freed a young woman who appeared in a viral miniskirt video. )",

The brigham and women's hospital and harvard medical school researchers were also able to for the first time put a number on the instances of what reuters terms a \" drug-resistant'superbug'strain \" of tb: mdr-tb. As many as 32,000 kids across the globe become sick with that form each year. Reuters notes that researchers have historically focused more on tb in adults, for a duo of reasons: adults are more likely to pass on the disease; and the diagnosis methods used on adults don't always work on kids, in part because up to 30 % of children who develop tb do so somewhere other than their lungs. But the attention is shifting to children in part because of what they can reveal about the transmission of the disease among adults: tb develops much more rapidly in children, signalling the presence of the disease in their adult family members or community. \" these 1 million children are missed opportunities for preventing tb every year, \" says the co-senior author of the study.",

        "summary": "Plagiarizing a eulogy is one thing. Plagiarizing a eulogy at the funeral of the wife you're suspected of plotting to kill is plainly quite another. Schoolteacher jayde panayiotou, 28, was kidnapped outside her home in uitenhage, south africa, on april 21 as she waited for a ride to work and was found shot to death on the outskirts of town a day later, jezebel reports. A suspect, thando siyoli, 31, was arrested shortly after and revealed to be a bouncer at a bar owned by the victim's husband, chris panayiotou. Siyoli told police panayiotou paid him to kill jayde and undercover officers attended her funeral dressed as mourners. There, they heard a seemingly moving eulogy, in which panayiotou described his wife as \" a master baker who was so good, she could have made mahatma gandhi break a fast. \" it turns out the words had been carefully crafted by a man who had lost his wife — but that man wasn't chris panayiotou. A quick google search revealed entire sections of the eulogy were plucked from one charles atkins wrote about his late wife in 2010, then published online. His lawyers say an \" obviously distraught \" panayiotou — whom times live reports had been spotted being \" very affectionate \" with another woman — used elements of the eulogy because he isn't good with words, not because of any alleged connection to his wife's murder, news24 reports. Panayiotou was arrested after police say they witnessed him hand over more cash to siyoli as payment for jayde's murder during a sting operation; a third suspect believed to have pulled the trigger is also now in custody, times live reports.",

Harold henthorn was the only witness to his wife toni henthorn's 40-foot fall in a steep area of deer mountain; he says his wife fell to her death while trying to take a picture. If convicted, he could face life in prison without parole and a $ 250,000 fine, reports cbs news. \" this is a satisfactory day in knowing that justice for toni is proceeding along, \" says toni's brother, who previously told cbs denver that in the wake of the death, his family learned that henthorn had lied about his job and his background. Cbs denver also notes that it previously reported toni's life insurance policies were worth $ 4.5 million, and that someone ( it's not clear who ) filed a claim for part of that money less than a day and a half after her death. Meanwhile, authorities in colorado's douglas county say they're now actively investigating the death of henthorn's first wife, sandra, who was crushed to death in 1995 along a country road. The sheriff's office said she was reaching under the couple's jeep cherokee to help change what henthorn says was a \" mushy \" tire when the jack slipped and the car fell on her, reports the denver post. Henthorn told authorities he was putting something in the trunk and didn't see the series of events that killed her. The death was ruled accidental, and henthorn was the beneficiary on a $ 300,000 life insurance policy on sandra. ( this man is accused of having his wife killed during their honeymoon. )",

Even though the national center for education statistics shows that grad students accounted for just 14 % of university enrollees in 2012, the new america foundation finds that this group is responsible for about 40 % of currently owed student debt. \" people focus on the undergraduates, because there are more of them and they're younger and more naive, \" a university of delaware professor tells time. But grad students don't rely on their parents to pay for school as much as undergrads do, and their borrowing limits are often higher, leading to an ever-increasing cycle of owed money. In fact, they borrow three times more per year than undergrads on average. This leads to other issues, such as graduate programs increasing tuition ( they figure students can just take out more loans to keep up ). The government hasn't been much of an advocate for the grad student, having halted subsidies on interest racked up on federal student loans while grad students are in school and for a short period after graduation, notes time. Although spending on a four-year college degree brings in a 15 % return, according to the hamilton project via the washington post, some graduate students aren't sure anything beyond that is worth it. \" in the back of my mind i was always thinking, this money is an investment, \" one doctoral student who has built up $ 200,000 in debt tells time. \" but now i don't think i ' m going to get the return i thought i would. \"",

An upper jawbone belonging to a human relative who lived in what is now tanzania almost 2 million years ago has been discovered with scratches on its still-intact teeth, and scientists have a clear idea about how they were made: by a stone tool held in the homo habilis individual's right hand. Why is that significant? well, it represents the earliest known evidence of right-handedness among human relatives. The next oldest comes from the 500,000-year-old teeth of a homo heidelbergensis individual, per national geographic. Evidence also suggests neanderthals were predominantly right-handed. In the case of homo habilis, archaeologists think the teeth nicks came about thusly: the individual would have a piece of meat clenched in his teeth, and while he stretched it out with one hand, he used the other, dominant, hand, to cut it with a stone, explains live science. ( it provides a graphic of what this looks like. ) occasionally, the stone would slip, and the direction of the resulting nicks suggests the right hand was the one used, a theory backed up in modern experiments. Few studies have analyzed homo habilis teeth for such marks, but study author david frayer of the university of kansas hopes his research will encourage others to do just that.

The homo habilis fossil is more than four times older than what scientists previously believed was the oldest fossil evidence of our right-handed tendencies, according to the",
            "Labial striations on the anterior teeth have been documented in numerous european pre-neandertal and neandertal fossils and serve as evidence for handedness. Oh-65, dated at 1.8 mya, shows a concentration of oblique striations on, especially, the left i1 and right i1, i2 and c1, which signal that it was right-handed. From these patterns we contend that oh-65 was habitually using the right hand, over the left, in manipulating objects during some kind of oral processing. In living humans right-handedness is generally correlated with brain lateralization, although the strength of the association is questioned by some. We propose that as more specimens are found, right-handedness, as seen in living homo,"

Just as astounding is that link has an identical twin brother logan who remains in utero and is growing normally. The unusual situation, which has left gorveatt both pre- and post-partum at the same time, is the result of twin to twin syndrome, in which the developing fetuses share a placenta and one draws blood from the other, leaving one \" bloated \" and the other \" weak, \" reports people. The syndrome is fatal 90 % of the time, martin walker, their doctor and the director of fetal medicine at evergreen health medical center in kirkland, wash., tells abc news. The twins underwent surgery at 21 weeks gestation in september to divide the placenta, but the pressure the twins put on gorveatt's cervix led to complications with link's amniotic sac; walker was forced to deliver him on sept. 29. Walker then manually closed her cervix to keep logan in utero — which he would not have been able to do had he not previously divided the placenta. Link is so small — a \" micro \" preemie — that he cannot eat on his own or even be held by his parents, who must resort to touching his tiny hand through an incubator. Komonews reports that gorveatt is on bed rest, and could be for months: logan's due date is jan. 26.

That gives obama a slight leg up from two weeks ago, when both candidates had 47 %. Public policy polling gives obama a 50 % to 47 % lead nationally, in what it says is the first time either candidate has opened up a lead of more than 2 points. In iowa, the des moines register gives obama a 47 % to 42 % edge, though a scant majority trust him more with the economy. \"if romney can't catch up here, he probably can't catch up elsewhere, \" says a dem pollster. \" without iowa and ohio, romney's path to victory is incredibly narrow. \" in ohio, the columbus dispatch gives obama a 50 % to 48 % lead, though that's within the survey's 2.2 % margin of error, and the paper notes that strong gop turnout could sway the buckeye state for romney.

Thirty-one exceeded 160 parts of glyphosate per billion, a level the ewg considers unsafe for children, per cnn, though the epa's standard is far lower, with its range topping out at 310 parts per million. \" even at the highest level reported … an adult would have to eat 118 pounds of the food item every day for the rest of their life in order to reach the epa's limit, \" monsanto tells cbs news. Ewg president ken cook has a political response, saying this shows the epa's \" lawless \" nature under president trump. Its standards \" pose real health risks to americans – particularly children, \" he tells the guardian, which hints at a larger issue, noting internal emails show the fda has had a hard time finding food without traces of the nation's most widely used herbicide, labeled a \" probable carcinogen \" by the world health organization.

In his great unfinished sculptures of slaves, human forms struggle to emerge from raw stone like souls trying to be born from the chrysalis of carnality into the life of the spirit. \" not getting it? the guardian concedes that both michelangelo and emin \" had some funny ideas, \" but concludes: \" that is because they are truly poetic artists. \" ( these people married inanimate objects. )",

Researchers from the university of houston, baylor college of medicine, and texas woman's university followed 257 latino adolescents — who were in the 85th percentile or greater for bmi — over a six-month period. During that time, about half the group snacked on peanuts or peanut butter right after school three to four times a week; their counterparts had the same snack less than once a week, and all children received nutrition education and engaged in physical activity. The researchers found the peanut-heavy group reduced their bmi more than twice as much as the other group over the course of the study. \" obesity is the most pressing health issue facing us today, \" study co-author craig johnston says in a press release. \" we'd like to think it's preventable, but from where i sit right now, there hasn't been a lot shown to be very effective on a large scale. \" he says that snacking on peanuts offers a \" creative \" solution that can help people manage their weight, appetite, and hunger, and as houston public media notes, peanuts are more universally liked than health foods like carrots. Meanwhile, huffington post reports that while just about any nut can make for a healthy, fat-filled snack ( yes, peanuts are technically a legume... ), almonds have the benefit of packing the fewest calories.

Yonhap reports that while there, kim upped the production of rocket engines and warhead tips for icbms. The wall street journal reports the timing of the visit to the chemical material institute of the academy of defense science wasn't given, but the timing of the release is notable: it comes one day after secretary of state rex tillerson said in a news briefing that he was \" pleased to see that the regime in pyongyang has certainly demonstrated some level of restraint that we have not seen in the past. \" it has been 26 days since the country's last missile launch. \" a two-week adherence of north korea to un prohibitions against missile tests hardly counts as a significant indicator of benign intent by the regime, \" is the assessment of one expert on the region to the journal. Cnn spotted something potentially more worrisome: the photos released by the korean central news agency show diagrams that seem to depict two unknown and potentially in development missiles. One, the pukguksong-3, seems to be a solid-fueled missile, as its predecessors were. This type has an advantage over liquid-fueled ones in that it doesn't need to sit on a launchpad for a length of time — during which it would be exposed to a preemptive strike — to fuel. \" this is the north koreans showing us, or at least portraying, that their solid-fuel missile program is improving at a steady rate, \" a researcher tells cnn.",

The runner says the drug got into his system through his girlfriend, who was treating a sinus infection and whom he \" frequently and passionately \" kissed.

The decision was expedited so roberts could compete in the usa track and field outdoor championships in order to qualify for world championships in london next month. The arbitrator says the failed drug test for roberts \" must have been like lightning out of a clear blue sky for him to learn by kissing his girlfriend this time that he was exposing himself to a prohibited substance, \" adding that the runner \" has met his burden of proof. \" the case echoes that of pole vault champ shawn barber, who tested positive for cocaine after visiting a female escort, usa today notes.
