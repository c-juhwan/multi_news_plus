        "summary": "Is it better to eat whole-grain sourdough bread made traditionally, or a slice of industrially mass-produced white bread? the answer arrived at by a recent study might surprise you: researchers looked at major metabolic markers, with most of them related to the risk of type 2 diabetes, and found no significant differences between people who ate the artisan sourdough and people who ate the factory-manufactured white bread, new scientist reports. \" the really shocking result was that on everything that we looked at, we didn't find any difference between the effects of the two breads, \" a co-author says, per the guardian. The white bread studied contained refined wheat flour, preservatives, and emulsifiers. Whether sourdough ( which was fresh ) or white ( which was packaged ), participants ate more bread ( 25 % of their total calories compared to a normal 10 % ) than usual, per a press release. The study looked at the gut microbiomes plus clinical measures including cholesterol, blood sugar, fat, and mineral levels in 20 participants prior to its start. The subjects were then randomly assigned to either eat the sourdough or the white bread for one week, then take a two-week break and switch breads. Participants ' gut microbiomes did not appear to be changed based on the bread they ate and researchers found no measurable differences when looking at most markers, but they did find that while half the group had a higher blood glucose response to the white bread, the other half had a higher response to the sourdough. Based on subjects ' microbiomes, researchers could actually predict which half a participant would fall under. \" the ' one-size-fits-all'diets that are given to the population as a whole, without personalization, are probably not optimal for everyone, \" a co-author says, per cbs.

In search warrant applications, a durham police investigator outlined what he called \" suspicious \" circumstances surrounding the death, and noted that the son told a firefighter he felt relieved his father was gone: \" [ the son ] explained that there had never been anything physical to occur, just constant verbal abuse over minor things like dishes being left in the sink and homework not being completed, \" one application says. \" [ he ] also told officers that he would be extremely fearful for what his father would do if he survived. \" searches of the teen's phone showed that he called his mother five times before calling 911 about his father, and that he had searched for financial information including how to transfer bank accounts after a death.

One who called it a \" very rare and exciting \" event said the \" main part \" of the junk likely fell into the ocean near brisbane. Another, however, noted a sonic boom heard in western new south wales after a five minute delay suggests it disintegrated. Mcdowell, meanwhile, said \" debris, if any survives, might have made it to south queensland. \" space junk falling from the sky isn't often spotted \" because most of the earth is either ocean — or very sparsely inhabited, \" or else it falls in the daytime, mcdowell added.",

        "summary": "Rio de janeiro has been plagued by body parts on beaches, muggings, and zika fears ahead of the summer olympics, and now a \" super bacteria \" has entered the mix. Brazilian scientists say the drug-resistant bacteria was found along the coast of popular beaches including flamengo and botafogo, both of which are near guanabara bay, where sailors will compete in august, cnn reports. \" every time you get some water in your face, it feels like there's some alien enemy entering, \" a german paralympic sailor says, noting he believes a teammate's skin infection may have been caused by the polluted water. And pollution is likely what's causing the super bacteria to proliferate in a \" variety of concentrations, \" lead scientist renata picao says, blaming the city's \" fragile \" sanitation system for the hazard. The researchers, who took samples from the bay as part of two studies in 2013 and 2014, explain the bacteria made its way into the bay and other local waterways via raw sewage from houses and local hospitals, per usa today. A director for rio's water company, however, says about half of the city's sewage is treated — a substantial increase from 11 % in 2009, he notes — and picao says that despite her own team's findings, they're not recommending the sailing event be moved, as they don't yet know what risks the bacteria poses. Instead, she says, doctors should simply know that antibiotics might not work if athletes do get sick. Still, picao doesn't take her kids to any of the affected beaches, which also include leblon and ipanema. \" we still need more studies to tell what would be the risk to human health of this exposure through the water, \" she says. Adding to the bay's issues: an oil slick that turned sailors ' boats brown, some complained monday to the new york post. \" your boat looks like a toilet, \" a finnish sailor says her partner was told.

While the standard story is that the artist shot himself in a field, managing to return to a nearby inn before he died, a new 900-page book paints a very different picture. In van gogh: the life, steven naifeh and gregory white smith postulate that a local teenager shot van gogh, likely accidentally, the telegraph reports. The teen, one rene secretan, had formed an odd relationship with van gogh; he mocked the painter and bought him drinks. After the shooting, van gogh was asked whether he intended to kill himself; he said, \" yes, i believe so. \" naifeh and smith say the painter didn't want to get the boy in trouble and wanted to die anyway. They also write that the angle of the bullet's entry path isn't what you'd expect in a suicide. The authors'version, which the bbc notes is based on thousands of letters studied over a decade, helps explain why neither a gun nor a suicide note was found, but they acknowledge that \" no one knows what happened. \"",

While men throw out words like \" hammered \" and \" tanked \" when faced with an intoxicated person, women tend to use more moderate terms. Why is word choice important? it can lead people to downplay risky and potentially dangerous situations like drunken driving and a woman's ability to fend off a sexual assault, the study said, per livescience. Conducted in 2007, the study asked 145 college undergrads — mainly white, aged 17 to 22 — to complete online surveys that described different scenarios in which males and females went to a bar, reports the la times. The students then assigned the characters words like buzzed, tipsy, obliterated, or wasted. Though males generally used heavier terms, they also applied those words to drunk men more than drunk women, who may downplay their drunkenness because of social and gender norms, the study said.",

That largely means three groups: the yemen government, the houthi rebels trying to oust the government, and a saudi-led coalition trying to prevent the rebels from succeeding because they're seen as a proxy for iran. The us isn't directly involved in the fighting, but it backs the saudi coalition and, along with other nations, supplies arms. The un investigators called on the international community to stop that supply line, reports the guardian. The 41-page report will be presented to the un human rights council next month to determine the next steps. \"despite the severity of the situation we continue to see a complete disregard for the people in yemen, \" says one of the report's authors, charles garraway. For example, the report accuses the saudi coalition of ignoring its own \" no-strike list \" and hitting refugee camps and hospitals with airstrikes. The rebels, meanwhile, are accused of blocking aid to civilians and using weapons indiscriminately in dense civilian areas. Civilians report widespread detentions, along with torture and rape. ( the uae in particular has been accused of running a network of secret detention sites. ) investigators also cite routine disappearances and the recruitment of children into battle.

In their first such report, they allege yemeni government forces, the saudi-led coalition backing them, and the rebel houthi movement have made little effort to minimise civilian casualties. They point to attacks on residential areas in which thousands have died. The warring parties are also accused of arbitrary detentions, torture, enforced disappearances and recruiting children. The experts will present their report to the un human rights council next month. Why is there a war in yemen? yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced president abdrabbuh mansour hadi to flee abroad.

            "Image copyright reuters image caption coalition air strikes have caused most direct civilian casualties un human rights experts believe war crimes may have been committed by all parties to the conflict in yemen. In their first such report, they allege yemeni government forces, the saudi-led coalition backing them, and the rebel houthi movement have made little effort to minimise civilian casualties. They point to attacks on residential areas in which thousands have died. The warring parties are also accused of arbitrary detentions, torture, enforced disappearances and recruiting children. The experts will present their report to the un human rights council next month. Why is there a war in yemen? yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced president abdrabbuh mansour hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an iranian proxy, the uae, saudi arabia and seven other arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government.

Farmers are harvesting their corn, which has been devastated by the worst drought in half a century, as a result rain would be of no help at this time of the season. Rain could be of marginal help to soybeans that were planted late in the season, but not to the bulk of the crop that is fast approaching harvest due to early planting this year. For farmers gearing up to plant the winter wheat crop, rain could boost soil moisture and get the crop in the world's top wheat exporter off to a good start.

Farmers are harvesting their corn, which has been devastated by the worst drought in half a century, as a result rain would be of no help at this time of the season. Rain could be of marginal help to soybeans that were planted late in the season, but not to the bulk of the crop that is fast approaching harvest due to early planting this year.

And canadian agencies involved in the needless rescue effort, a federal appeals court ruled tuesday. In a 2-1 ruling, the 6th u.s. Circuit court of appeals in cincinnati found that a lower court properly ordered 21-year-old danik kumar of sandusky to pay for all costs associated with the march 2012 search, launched after he reported seeing a fishing boat with four people on board sending up flares on lake erie as he was flying a small plane overhead. About 70 personnel from the u.s. Coast guard and the canadian coast guard used three boats, a helicopter and a small plane before calling off the search. A month later, kumar told investigators that though he originally thought he saw a single flare go up, he never saw a boat, according to court records. Kumar told investigators that he continued reporting a boat in distress for fear of sounding stupid and ruining his chances of becoming a coast guard aviator, court records say. After kumar pleaded guilty to making a false distress call, federal judge sara lioi sentenced him to three months in jail, and ordered him to pay $ 277,000 to the u.s. Coast guard and $ 212,000 to"

The vice president invited rabbi loren jacobs to the stage at the event in suburban detroit to offer a prayer for victims of the pittsburgh mass shooting, and jacobs invoked \" jesus the messiah \" in his opening remarks. Jacobs practices messianic judaism, which jewish leaders consider a form of christianity, the washington post reports. There are more than 60 rabbis in the state directory, \" and yet the only rabbi they could find to offer a prayer for the 11 jewish victims in pittsburgh at the mike pence rally was a local jew for jesus rabbi? that's pathetic! \" detroit-area rabbi jason miller wrote in a facebook post. In other developments: wheelchair for court appearance. Alleged shooter robert bowers, who was injured in an exchange of fire with police, was in a wheelchair during a brief court appearance monday, the pittsburgh post-gazette reports. He was ordered held without bail after the federal judge gave an overview of the 29 charges against him, some of which carry the death penalty. His next hearing will be thursday morning. The 46-year-old also faces state murder charges. He showed no clear signs of injury during the appearance, though he didn't move very much, the new york times reports.",

Per the suit, brasher should have been trained how to properly operate a tank, but was not, so he should not have been allowed to drive it. The suit says brasher actually asked wright, a 54-year-old contractor who had been hired to take care of rowland's vehicles and move them, to come along on the ride because of his lack of training. Wright sat next to brasher, but faced backward; alfert says brasher should have known this was a \" dangerous position, \" barring wright from being able to see coming bumps in the road. The lawsuit also says rowland had a responsibility to add \" safety features, \" including seat belts and hand rails, to the tank, but he did not.

His nephew, brendan dassey, was also convicted in the case, but his conviction was overturned by a federal court in wisconsin last summer. In zellner's filing, she suggests that manitowoc county sheriff's deputies conspired with hillegas to plant evidence — including halbach's vehicle — in avery's salvage yard, wisn reports. She says that during the original trial, avery's lawyers lacked the experts who could prove that evidence had been planted. Trial attorney dean strang tells the ap he is glad zellner filed the motion. \" all that really matters here, to us and we hope to everyone, is that we get closer to the truth in this case and to justice for everyone, \" he says. ( zellner is having key pieces of evidence independently retested. )",

So the chicagoan threw up a project in which he promised to eat a burrito, rate it, and create a \" deliciousness graph. \" he set the goal at $ 8: enough for the burrito, the sales tax, and a $ 1 tip. In the risks and challenges section he wrote things like, \" i might accidentally receive a carnitas or steak filling instead of chicken \" and \" i might drop the burrito on the floor. \" of course, the goofy campaign proved to be media catnip, drawing write-ups from slate, cnet, betabeat, and more. Bitoy instantly shot past his goal — way, way past. As of this writing, 171 backers have pledged $ 654. So, like any good kickstarter project, bitoy has added stretch goals. At this point he has committed to: eat 24 varieties of chipotle chicken burritos, trying every possible variation with all three salsas. Eat four burritos over a period of four days to see how they taste as they age. Eat a burrito while skydiving. \" this truly is the greatest kickstarter ever, \" one backer commented. \" this must be one of the most fulfilling pledges i have ever made, \" another agreed. \" you made my day. \" the campaign doesn't end for another 21 days, but bitoy has posted a video of himself eating the first burrito anyway.

Essentially, tomczak created his own static and put it on youtube. Now, youtube is claiming tomczak's static is too similar to the static of other white noise publishers, violating their copyrights. The bbc reports tomczak has been hit with five copyright infringement claims generated by youtube's automated system. And rather than have his video removed or account shut down, the companies behind the claims have elected to leave tomczak's video up and simply commandeer any ad revenue it generates. Tomczak calls the claims \" spurious \" and says he \" will be disputing \" them. This isn't the first case of youtube's automated copyright system perhaps running amok. In 2012, a youtube user said the system filed a copyright claim against him based on birds singing in the background of one of his videos. Tomczak himself says he was hit with a claim on his own behalf after he let coworkers use his music in a video.",

Photo: alena kuzub/getty images in a major upset, boston city councilor ayanna pressley defeated ten-term congressman michael capuano in a massachusetts house primary on tuesday night. With no republican running in the general election, pressley is expected to become the first black woman to represent the state in congress. Capuano is the second veteran democrat to lose a primary battle in 2018, after alexandria ocasio-cortez unseated new york congressman joe crowley in june. Pressley challenged capuano from the left, and the race attracted national attention from journalists seeking out the next potential ocasio-cortez — particularly after the queens politician endorsed pressley hours after her own upset victory. The two women shared campaign staff and appeared together at a campaign fundraiser. A huge congrats to @ocasio2018 for your victory tonight! you proved that when we stand up for what we believe in, we win. This is about more than one campaign or election. This is a movement. Together, we will change the world. Congratulations! #changecantwait #ocasio2018 pic.twitter.com/imorpc1jst — ayanna pressley ( @ayannapressley ) june 27, 2018 however, there were significant differences between the two races.

        "summary": "Graphic and extensive news reports on a teen suicide may lead to more teen suicides, a new study has found. Researchers looked at 48 teen suicide \" clusters \" in us communities where three to 11 teens killed themselves over a six-month period occurring between 1988 and 1996 ( before internet news became prevalent, notes livescience ); each cluster was compared to sole teen suicides that took place in two \" matched control communities \" in the same state. Researchers then dug into newspaper archives to gauge the coverage at the time, and found a correlation between how much newspaper attention is given to a suicide and the likelihood that others will follow. Specifically, there were as many as 55 stories between the first and second clustered suicide ( with an average of seven ), and up to 36 after a noncluster suicide ( with an average of five ). The cluster-stories were also more likely to make the front page and include graphic details. Healthday is quick to point out that the study certainly doesn't establish causation, and the lead researcher agrees that suicide \" won't emerge in young people without underlying risk factors. \" but the cause of clusters remains a mystery, and newspaper coverage can be changed, she points out. \" our findings indicate that the more sensational the coverage of the cause of the suicides, and the more details the story provides, then the more likely there are to be more suicides. \" the next step? \" investigating the role of newer media in suicide clusters, \" the study says.",

Harvard researchers presented their findings at an american heart association forum, reports upi. After studying data from a long-term observational study of 4.24 million people, they found that most participants consumed less than 12 grams of gluten daily. Those who ate low amounts of gluten within that range were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than at the upper end of the range, say the researchers in a press release. Gluten is a protein in wheat, rye, and barley, and though a small percentage of people cannot tolerate it, gluten-free diets have become popular with a wider range of people. \" gluten-free foods often have less dietary fiber and other micronutrients, making them less nutritious and they also tend to cost more, \" says one of the researchers. \" people without celiac disease may reconsider limiting their gluten intake for chronic disease prevention, especially for diabetes. \" the study finds correlation, not causation, but there are already a few theories floating around. One is that the gluten-free versions of foods that are typically made with gluten ( cereals, cakes, crackers ) often have lots of sugar, and thus attempting to go gluten-free could inadvertently result in a less healthy diet. One thing that could help: a dietitian tells healthline that those who are on gluten-free diets should take care to make sure they don't eat too many processed foods.

President barack obama put the authoritarian government in havana on the spot monday, taking questions from reporters and insisting that his cuban counterpart also deliver answers to pointed queries on human rights, political prisoners and economic reforms. Though they both acknowledged deep disagreements on these issues, the two leaders found common ground on the topic of the economic embargo on cuba, which both want lifted. Obama went so far as to declare that \" the embargo's going to end, \" though he couldn't say when. In an extraordinary sign of the shifting attitudes, castro was willing to answer one question on why his regime was keeping cubans incarcerated for expressing anti-government views. But his response only underscored the schisms between himself and obama. \" did you ask if we had political prisoners? give me a list of political prisoners and i will release them immediately",

The federal government has come up with a plan to help puerto rico restructure its debt, but it will require approval from congress, where republicans are unlikely to comply, reports the new york times. The plan includes restructuring under a new federal bankruptcy system that would only apply to territories, reports the wall street journal. It also includes greater federal oversight of puerto rico's finances, which the gop approves of, and an expansion of medicaid.

The times theorizes that's because toyota, still looking to restore its reputation after the unintended acceleration problems five years ago, is being more proactive about calling back cars in order to avoid lawsuits or fines from regulators. This recall applies to the prius model generation that went on sale in 2009 — meaning it affects more than half of all priuses ever sold, bloomberg reports.

        "summary": "Kate and david ogg held onto their dying baby five years ago as a way of saying goodbye, only to find him come miraculously back to life. Now the media has returned to see how the family in queensland, australia, is doing — and apparently they're happily raising three young children, the telegraph reports. In fact, 5-year-old jamie's family kids him about how he came back from the dead and hasn't been alive as long as his twin sister, emily. \" technically, you're two minutes older, but emily's been alive longer, \" kate used to tell him, according to an old today article. The story dates back to a scary day in 2010, when jamie and emily were born 14 weeks premature, and doctors said newborn jamie was dying. So the parents got in bed together and cuddled with the baby. \" i wanted to meet him, and to hold him, and for him to know us, \" kate told today after it happened. \" we'd resigned ourselves to the fact that we were going to lose him, and we were just trying to make the most of those last, precious moments. \" suddenly, jamie's breathing improved and hospital staff jumped in to fully revive him. The story highlights the partly recognized science of \" kangaroo care \" — that newborns receive health benefits by being held closely to a parent's bare skin or chest. Several studies support kangaroo care, and it's become more common in us neonatal intensive care units, the huffington post reports. No doubt the oggs would support that: \" we feel so fortunate, \" says david. \" we're the luckiest people in the world. \" ( a baby born dead last year revived 25 minutes later. )",

        "summary": "The senate passed its version of a budget blueprint thursday night, but even lawmakers acknowledge that it's safe to ignore almost all of it. The blueprint that passed on a 51-49 vote contains many items great for political posturing but unlikely to actually become law. However, its passage accomplishes one huge thing for republicans and president trump — it includes parliamentary language that will make it possible for the gop to pass the president's upcoming tax plan with a simple majority, meaning democrats won't be allowed to filibuster, reports the new york times. As republican bob corker, who sits on the budget committee put it: \" the only thing about this that matters is preparation for tax reform. \" he called the rest of the budget process \" the biggest hoax hatched upon the american people ever, \" per politico. Trump himself quickly praised the vote, hailing it overnight thursday in a tweet as the \" first step toward delivering massive tax cuts. \" he continued friday morning. \" this now allows for the passage of large scale tax cuts ( and reform ), which will be the biggest in the history of our country! \" he wrote. Now comes what the wall street journal calls a \" sprint \" to get a tax plan written and passed before the end of the year. The newspaper lays out the difficult next steps, with both the house and senate needing to reach agreement on the same plan. One big hurdle: the senate's version has tax cuts that could increase the deficit by $ 1.5 trillion over the next decade, while the house version calls for no deficit increase at all. House speaker paul ryan has floated the possibility of an early november vote in his chamber, which politico sees as \" ambitious. \"",

            "Born on august 17, 1786, backwoods statesman davy crockett's life has often been obscured by myth. Even during his lifetime, fanciful stories about his adventures were transforming him into a buck-skinned superhero. And after his death, the tales kept growing taller. So let's separate fact from fiction. 1. He ran away from home at age 13. When davy was 13, his father paid for him to go to a school. But just four days in, davy was bullied by a bigger and older boy. Never one to back down from a fight, one day crockett waited in a bush along the road home until evening. When the boy and his gang walked up the road, crockett leaped from the bush and, as he later wrote in his autobiography, \"set on him like a wild cat. \" terrified that the schoolmaster would whip him for beating one of the boys so severely, he decided to start playing hooky. His father, john, was furious when a letter inquiring about his son's poor attendance showed up. Grabbing a stick, he chased after davy, who fled. The teen spent the next few years traveling from his native tennessee to maryland, performing odd jobs. When he returned, crockett's parents didn't recognize him at first. Following an",

Conservative lawmakers were honing an impeaching filing for the deputy attorney general friday at the same time he announced 12 indictments against russians for alleged election hacking, capitol hill sources tell politico. In fact, rosenstein was talking to reporters just as house freedom caucus chairman mark meadows had the document on the house floor. Conservative sources say the filing could come monday. House republicans have planned rosenstein's ouster for weeks, saying he's failed to expedite their investigation into fbi agents allegedly biased against president trump. Of course, rosenstein is also overseeing robert mueller's probe into russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice by trump — which democrats say is the real reason republicans want him out. Whether conservatives will actually support rosenstein's impeachment is unclear. Top house republicans like speaker paul ryan don't seem enthusiastic, which could spell a further divide on the political right: \" it's likely that as the mueller investigation proceeds there will be a widening rift on the political right between die-hard trump loyalists and those willing to follow the evidence where it leads, \" writes jeet heer at the new republic.",

        "summary": "Whale researchers say they've collected enough evidence to make a remarkable assertion: humpback whales deliberately save other creatures from killer whales. The scientists collected 115 accounts between 1951 and 2012, they write in marine mammal science. Maine ecologist robert pitman got the idea for the survey after seeing an encounter himself in 2009. A group of killer whales, or orcas, had spotted a seal on an ice floe in antarctica and created a wave that forced it into the water. As the orcas zeroed in for an easy meal, two humpbacks showed up, and the seal swam toward them. One of the humpbacks rolled over, and the seal ended up on its chest. \" then, as the killer whales moved in closer, the humpback arched its chest, lifting the seal out of the water, \" a \" shocked \" pittman recounted in natural history. When the seal began to fall off the whale's chest, \" the humpback gave the seal a gentle nudge with its flipper... And moments later the seal scrambled off and swam to the safety of a nearby ice floe. \" so why would humpbacks do this? that part is unclear. Killer whales are too small to hunt adult humpbacks, but they do go after calves, and the humpbacks might be trying to discourage that, notes a post at mother nature network. They might be effectively hard-wired at this point to move in when they see orcas attacking anything, adds science. Whatever the reason, an noaa marine biologist not involved with the study is convinced. \"they make a very good case that it's a proactive response to killer whales, \" he says. \"i think they're absolutely right. \" ( scientists also just found a new whale species. )",

The final tally was 54-42 in favor of the measure — with three democrats voting for it and two republicans voting against it — but it needed 60 votes to move ahead. Supporters of the bill, which passed the house in may, say fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks, reports nbc news. Critics say that such late abortions are rare but occasionally medically necessary and that the exemptions written into the bill — for rape, incest, and the safety of the mother — were too vaguely worded. Republican susan collins, who voted against the ban, says it would \" make a criminal out of a physician \" for trying to keep pregnant women from being seriously injured. The hill reports that even had the bill passed it likely would have been legally challenged, as federal courts have struck down similar state bans for violating the supreme court's protection of abortion rights. Harry reid called the vote a \" waste of time \" and insinuated it was merely an attempt by republicans to ingratiate themselves with the pope, who speaks at the capitol thursday, according to nbc. \" i guess they want to do that before the pope gets here, \" he says. \" but it's not going to change the pope, how he feels about the fact that republicans have ignored poor people in america. \" meanwhile, a contingent of anti-abortion republicans is attempting to force a government shutdown oct. 1 if planned parenthood isn't defunded.

        "summary": "Domestic violence is inarguably bad — but for nearly 400 members of russia's parliament, it's not that bad if it only happens once a year and doesn't cause \" substantial bodily harm. \" that's the 380-3 opinion that led to a bill being passed friday in the country's duma, or lower chamber, to decriminalize domestic violence violations and instead issue a fine of around $ 500 or a 15-day arrest if it doesn't happen again within 12 months, usa today reports. The upper chamber gets a crack at the bill next, where it's expected to sail through before moving on to president vladimir putin's desk — and he's already suggested he ' ll support it. The decision would reverse the country's supreme court decision last year to keep criminal charges for anyone accused of battery against family members. \" violence isn't just a norm, it's our style of life, \" an advocate for tougher laws tells the economist. ( the magazine takes note of a russian proverb: \" if he beats you, it means he loves you. \" ) indeed, a mid-january survey by a state-run pollster found 19 % of russians believe, \" in certain circumstances, \" that it \" can be acceptable \" to hit a spouse or child. And last year's court decision to keep family abuse criminal elicited criticism from conservative lawmakers and organizations, including one pol who said the decision was being \" anti-family \" by dictating how kids could be raised. Supporters of friday's bill say it will put the onus on those who need it most — repeat offenders — but critics are shaking their heads, the ap reports. \" this bill would establish violence as a norm of conduct, \" one lawmaker said during friday's debate, per the news agency.",

        "summary": "Iraqi kurds voted for independence from iraq last month, and one tangible result of the vote emerged monday: iraqi forces moved in. Baghdad, which considered the referendum illegal, is worried about losing control of the oil-rich kirkuk region in the north. As a result, state-backed militias seized two oil fields and other sites on the outskirts of the city monday, reports the ap, setting up the potential for a longer conflict. Related: us vs. Us: the developments put the us in an uncomfortable position. As part of the fight against isis, american troops have trained and supported the iraqi forces as well as the kurdish fighters known as peshmerga now resisting them, notes the new york times. Us troops were monitoring the developments but not taking part. Iran's role: iran, too, is worried about kurdish moves toward independence, and militias tied to the government were helping the iraqi forces, reports the washington post. This comes as the us has talked of trying to limit iran's influence in the region, leaving one kurdish commander flummoxed. \" if you want to push back iranian influence, don't stay quiet. \" oil prices: world oil prices have jumped because of the crisis, and cnbc quotes an analyst who thinks the trend will continue for a while. Brent crude, the world benchmark, rose 1.4 % to $ 57.97 a barrel. The reason is simple, explains the financial times: iraq is one of the world's biggest producers of oil, and much of that oil comes from the kirkuk region. Kirkuk itself: while iraqi forces controlled installations outside kirkuk, the city itself remained under kurdish control, reports reuters. Two troubling developments for the kurds, however: they no longer control major supply lines into the city, and rifts were evident between two major factions. The kurdistan democratic party, or kdp, vowed to resist, while the patriotic union of kurdistan, or puk, seemed willing to make concessions.",

After cpl. Wassef ali hassoun vanished from the base in 2004, he was seen days later in what appeared to be a hostage video taken by islamic militants, but arrived unharmed at the us embassy in beirut within the month, nbc reports. He was sent back to the us and charged with desertion after prosecutors accused him of faking his kidnapping. He was charged with desertion again in early 2005 after he fled to lebanon, where he was born, ahead of a hearing on the first charge. On his return to the us in 2004, hassoun insisted he was a loyal marine. \" i did not desert my post, \" he told reporters. \" i was captured and held against my will by anti-coalition forces for 19 days. This was a very difficult and challenging time for me. \" military officials say the naval criminal investigative service worked with hassoun to get him to turn himself in, the ap reports. The 34-year-old — who feared for his life in lebanon, according to military officials — surrendered to ncis investigators in bahrain, and has now been returned to the us.

        "summary": "After a boston red line train went through four stations without a driver thursday, the governor of massachusetts said it had been \" tampered with. \" the news today doesn't sound quite so sinister: the investigation is focusing on operator error, the state's department of transportation secretary tells wcvb. The driver, david vazquez, who has more than 25 years of experience, was placed on administrative leave pending the results of an investigation, cbs boston reports. Gov. Charlie baker later said the train controls \" had been manipulated, which was why the train moved without a person controlling it, \" and that it remains to be determined whether simple negligence or something else is to blame. On friday, he said the driver made \" multiple \" errors, the ap reports, and the dot secretary called the driver's actions \" irresponsible. \" the mbta is investigating along with several other agencies, the boston globe reports. While parked at a station, the driver said there was a signal problem and asked to put the train into \" bypass mode, \" meaning it would be allowed to move even if it didn't get the correct signal. He had to leave the train to throw a toggle switch in order to get into bypass mode, and the train ended up leaving while he wasn't inside. It clipped him, and he reported the incident within moments. Per mbta procedures, he should have set two brakes before exiting the train, and the dot secretary says at least one of those had not been set. She says there are also reports the throttle had been tied back with a cord. One transportation researcher explains that it's common for subway operators to go into bypass mode rather than being forced to wait at a station if there's a signal failure, but says he doesn't know how the train would have been able to accelerate without a driver at the controls: \" that's really the freakiest part, \" he says. \" you need a person to push the throttle to move it. \"",

Essentially, may is betting that voters will give her ruling conservative party a mandate as the complex eu negotiations continue, explains the new york times.

She wants the election held on june 8, but it's not a certainty: may will formally propose the idea to the house of commons on wednesday, where it must be approved by a two-thirds majority.

        "summary": "Can't stop at just one cup of joe to wake up? you might be missing a certain variation of the pdss2 gene, which instructs our bodies to break down caffeine more slowly. Researchers in scotland report in the journal scientific reports that they interviewed and examined the dna of nearly 3,000 coffee drinkers in italy and holland and found that those with the variation tended to drink roughly one less cup of coffee daily than others. A slower breakdown of caffeine means it stays in the body longer, so one cup is more likely to do the trick, explains livescience. Researchers, however, say further research is needed to fully understand what's going on. The pdss2 gene isn't the first to be implicated in caffeine consumption, reports time. A major 2014 study of more than 120,000 coffee drinkers found six genetic markers associated with physical responses to caffeine. One researcher tells the magazine that coffee \" is kind of controversial \" because it is, to a degree, protective of some diseases for some people but may predispose others to diseases as well. \" so understanding what is driving this and how we make food choices is very important. \" some of the health benefits linked to coffee include a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, a longer life, and healthier arteries.

        "summary": "In recent weeks, hardly a day has passed without a big measles-related headline, but one of the most-talked-about stories to surface actually dates to 1988 — and, before that, 1962. In that earlier year, famed children's book author roald dahl lost his 7-year-old daughter to measles encephalitis, which the washington post terms one of the disease's \" worst complications. \" per the cdc, the brain inflammation occurs roughly 6 days after the onset of the rash, and did so in about one out of every 1,000 cases reported between 1985 and 1992; the fatality rate is 15 %. In 1988, dahl shared his experience in a leaflet published by the uk's sandwell health authority in support of the then-newly-available measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, reports the guardian. It reads in part ( in full at io9 ): \" one morning, when [ olivia ] was well on the road to recovery, i was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, i noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn't do anything. ' are you feeling all right? ' i asked her. ' i feel all sleepy,'she said. In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead. \" he goes on to explains that in 1962, there was nothing doctors could do to save olivia from measles encephalitis — and more than two decades later as he wrote those words, that was still the case. \" on the other hand, there is today something that parents can do \": immunize their children, something he couldn't do when olivia was young because a safe vaccine wasn't yet available. The guardian notes that dahl's widow said the author spent his life unable to talk about olivia; in his 1988 writing, he noted he dedicated james and the giant peach and the bfg to olivia, the latter after her death. \" i know how happy she would be if only she could know that her death had helped to save a good deal of illness and death among other children. \"",

The former whitewater counsel who once tried to take down the clintons had his president title at baylor university yanked away thursday in the wake of a sex-assault scandal that also resulted in the firing of football coach art briles ( officially, \" suspension with intent to terminate, \" per the ap ) and the probation of ian mccaw, the college's athletic director, the new york times reports. Starr will hold onto his second role as chancellor, but he ' ll vacate the president's post on may 31. The organizational changes came after baylor retained a law firm last august to look into how the university had managed several sexual-assault accusations against members of the football team — and the news that came back wasn't good. That review, which deadspin notes was compiled by baylor into a 13-page \" findings of fact \", revealed a \" fundamental failure \" in adhering to federal regulations and dealing with misconduct claims, baylor said in a statement. The pepper hamilton probe — which included \" an exhaustive review of data, \" as well as more than 65 interviews with current and ex-university employees and students — also found that some school bigwigs'dealings may have \" directly discouraged \" possible victims from speaking out; in one case, the report notes someone filed an assault claim and was retaliated against by the college. Starr had attracted much attention ( and cash, in the hundreds of millions ) for baylor through fundraising efforts, in large part by touting its football team — a move that some say led baylor to make moral compromises in the name of its football program, the times notes. Starr had penned a letter in february, writing, \" our hearts break for those whose lives are impacted by execrable acts of sexual violence. … sexual violence emphatically has no place whatsoever at baylor university. \" sb nation notes other administrators have also been terminated, though the school says it won't publicly id them.

House conservatives haven't committed to backing the plan yet, politico reports, and four gop senators from states that expanded medicaid under obamacare released a letter monday expressing concern that the plan to repeal expansion after 2020 could lead to a \" reduction in access to life-saving health care services \" and saying they would not support a \" plan that does not include stability for medicaid expansion populations. \" a roundup of coverage: this is the gop's best shot yet at translating talk about repeal and replace into action, the washington post reports in a look at the plan's details, but the party faces a tough balancing act trying to please lawmakers worried about making entitlements permanent at the same time as those worried about people losing coverage. The hill reports that the house plan drops most of the taxes associated with obamacare, but keeps the \" cadillac \" tax on the more expensive health plans. In a move that does not sit well with some conservatives, the tax will kick in after 2025. Breitbart reports that conservative columnist charles krauthammer says more radical conservatives \" are going to have to fall on their swords \" over the plan. They're \" going to have to concede the fact that obama created an entitlement, \" he said on fox, and trying to eliminate it \" would destroy the presidency. \" critics say the biggest problem with the plan is that it appears certain to result in millions of people losing coverage, despite president trump's assurances, cnn reports. \" with medicaid reductions and smaller tax credits, this bill would clearly result in fewer people insured than under the aca, \" says larry levitt at the kaiser family foundation. \" the house gop proposal seeks to reduce what the federal government spends on health care, and that inevitably means more people uninsured. \" slate describes the gop plan as \" hard to assess, \" since it \" does not include a price tag or an estimate of how many americans the plan will actually cover. \" senate minority leader chuck schumer was among democrats who criticized the plan, saying \" trumpcare doesn't replace the affordable care act, it forces millions of americans to pay more for less care, \" reuters reports.
