( last summer, the arizona cardinals made jen welter the first woman to hold any kind of coaching position in the nfl. )",

But the nomination didn't support the claim of architectural significance, james gabbert, the national register historian who reviewed the nomination, wrote to the historic preservation program in january. \" the original nomination form presented a wealth of information about cash and his family, and simply needed to be tweaked to justify listing it for that significance, \" gabbert said friday. \" the property has two separate but related and intertwined areas of significance -- the association with the fera and the dyess colony, and the effect that being a part of that colony had on johnny cash's development as an artist. \" in the title of the original nomination, cash's parents got top billing: \" farm no. 266, ray and carrie cash home ( johnny cash boyhood home ). \" [ interactive: 360-degree tour of johnny cash's boyhood home + guide to other state sites tied to the singer ] in the revised nomination, the name was listed as \" farm no. 266, johnny cash boyhood home. \" besides adding more context concerning architecture, the house was renominated in april under criterion b, which concerns the lives of significant people -- specifically, the property's association with the early life of cash and the influence the area had on cash's later musical career.",
            "Dyess, ark. ( ap ) — the man in black's boyhood home has been added to the national register of historic places. The arkansas historic preservation program announced friday that the home in dyess where country music icon johnny cash lived from age 3 through high school has been added to the register. Dyess is a small arkansas town close to the tennessee border. The five-room farmhouse was built in 1934 as part of the dyess resettlement colony by the federal emergency relief administration. The arkansas democrat-gazette reports that the house is owned by arkansas state university, which spent $ 575,000 to buy, restore, furnish and landscape the property. Cash died in 2003 at age 71 after an incredibly successful musical career. Among his many hit songs were \" i walk the line \" and \" ring of fire. \" ___ information from: arkansas democrat-gazette, http://www.arkansasonline.com"

Such is the plight of texas high school student macie martinez, who was home with her parents on memorial day when a storm blew in.

It was a deep scream. \" the teen tells myfox austin that she remembers not being able to feel her legs, and her parents hustled her to the hospital. She suffered nerve damage in her arms and hands, and doctors are keeping an eye on her kidney and liver, but she seems to have escaped major harm. \" i feel very lucky, \" she tells the tv station. \" lucky to be sitting here doing this interview today. \" she's even making light of herself on instagram, telling people to call her sparky. It turns out that martinez's father also got zapped, though his telltale rash didn't show up until after the family had returned from the hospital. \" my right arm gets tingly, \" he says. The family home sustained significant damage from the strike, which a neighbor says appeared to have come from beneath the house and exited through the roof. Appliances were fried, with the coffee maker one of the few survivors. That's fine with mom: \" i get my daughter and coffee maker, so i ' m set. \" ( this guy survived a lightning strike to the head. )",

Or at least, that's what the obama administration suspects. Whereas yesterday's riots in egypt appeared spontaneous, attackers in libya showed up with mortars and rocket-propelled-grenades, officials tell the new york times, though they're not sure yet if those people organized the riot or merely took advantage. But sources tell cnn that they don't believe stevens was specifically targeted. Stevens died of smoke inhalation, a libyan doctor tells the ap. A us official says the building caught fire when someone threw a grenade. Employees \" were fighting the fire inside and the attackers outside, \" the official tells cnn, adding that there were \" valiant but unsuccessful \" attempts to go back and save people. In a brief statement today, president obama vowed that \" justice will be done, \" the ap reports. He didn't elaborate on what that might mean, but a senior official says that the white house is expected to approve a plan to send spy drones to look for jihadi camps near benghazi that may have been involved in the attack.",

Eva cuypers and her team at the university of leuven separated the tissues and organs of six humans and 26 different animals, placing them in jars to decompose over the next six months. By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans. These five compounds — called esters — were created by decomposing muscles, carbohydrates, and fat, discovery reports. The esters create a \" singular chemical cocktail \" in decomposing humans and could explain why so-called cadaver dogs are able to sniff out dead people amid any number of competing smells, including other dead animals, science reports. Cuypers and her team published their findings last week. They believe the results could be used to better train cadaver dogs or even create a machine that could do the same job. And discovery points out the synthetic smell of decomposing human bodies could prove popular at halloween parties. Experts have questioned components of the research — including the separation of tissue and organs — and cuypers plans a follow-up study using full bodies buried in a field, science reports.

Speaking at california's camp pendleton, he described the extra american troops now in the northern city of irbil as \" assessment team members \" who will assist the effort to help members of the yazidi minority threatened by islamic state extremists. A helicopter bringing supplies to people trapped on mount sinjar crashed yesterday after too many refugees climbed on board. More: as the plight of the refugees becomes increasingly desperate, american officials say a ground force may be necessary to get the refugees off the mountain, the new york times reports. John kerry says the 130 advisers will be tasked with finding a safe way out. \" we will make a very rapid and critical assessment because we understand it is urgent to try to move those people off the mountain, \" he told reporters today. Prime minister nouri al-maliki, meanwhile, appears to have given up on trying to cling to power at any cost, the new york times notes. He has told troops deployed in baghdad not to intervene in the crisis — and officials say the military has told maliki he no longer has their support. Insiders say discussions on maliki stepping down are now focused on immunity from prosecution. New iraqi president fouad massoum has chosen deputy parliament speaker haider al-ibadi as maliki's replacement. France is sending arms in \" coming hours \" to kurds fighting the islamic state in a situation it calls \" catastrophic, \" reports the ap. The move comes with baghdad's blessing. Across the border in syria, islamic state militants have made fresh gains, reports the ap.

        "summary": "Should it ever erupt, a supervolcano beneath yellowstone national park could blanket north america in an ash cloud, wipe out communications, and alter the climate. Given that eruptions of supervolcanoes buried on our planet — and there are several — are thought to occur every 100,000 years or so, however, the likelihood of such an event during your lifetime is small, reports the new york times. As comforting as that may be, new research out of arizona state university is far less so. Whereas researchers previously thought such an eruption would be centuries or millennia in the making, an analysis of fossilized ash left over from yellowstone's last supereruption 630,000 years ago reveals the process could take only decades. Tiny crystals left over from underground magma at yellowstone show the first sign of the last supereruption was a spike in temperature that coincided with the movement of new magma into the reservoir beneath the supervolcano. The crystals also reveal a supereruption followed much quicker than scientists previously thought — perhaps within decades, or what popular mechanics calls \" a geologic snap of the finger. \" this is the first indication that \" the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime, \" which one researcher describes as \" shocking, \" per the times. For now, though, you can rest easy. The lead scientist at the yellowstone volcano observatory tells national geographic there's no sign of any \" magmatic event \" at this time.

        "summary": "This could change things: some syrian rebels now have antiaircraft missiles, rebels and regional officials say. Video footage appears to show the rebels using such weapons, which have been smuggled into the country, the wall street journal reports. Rebels say they downed a military helicopter yesterday, one of at least four aircraft reportedly shot down this week — if true, that's a quicker pace since the summer, although it's not clear how the copters and jets were brought down. Despite the fact that this could be good news for the rebels, it's bad news for the us, which worries such weapons could end up with anti-western militias. More from syria: the rebels today blew up one oil pipeline and one gas pipeline near deir al-zour, the ap reports, citing state media. Meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed in government airstrikes on rebel areas last night and this morning, activists say. Though syrian president bashar al-assad has tried to shield damascus, war has now reached the capital, the new york times reports. The fighting isn't as intense as in other cities like aleppo or homs, but it's drastically increased since a few months ago: checkpoints abound, kidnappings are common, bombings are increasing, and it's not safe to go out after dark. \" how soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed? \" wonders one resident. Similarly, syria's wealthy — many of whom back the president — are now seeing their businesses hurt by the war, and some are losing faith in assad, the ap reports. Many have seen factories burned or otherwise affected by fighting, and others have had their money restricted by sanctions. Yet more trouble for assad: even his own sect, the alawite minority, is growing discontent, the washington post reports. Alawites had been strong backers of assad, as the sunni majority backed the rebellion, because they feared losing power to sunni islamists. But, though there is no indication that alawites plan to join the rebellion, there are reports of rifts even within assad's own extended family.",

For more than five years, scrap and trash has consistently been the us's biggest export ( paywall ), for which china is the number one customer, and the market has doubled in size since 2006. \"the public doesn't realize this, but recycling is made possible by technology and markets — they think it's just a matter of technology, \" an industry insider with expertise in china's waste management told quartz. \"and we don't have strong enough markets in the us. \" but hints are emerging that american cities and the companies that sell trash are in for a rude awakening. A recent sign of this comes from oregon, where truckloads of plastic are piling up at recycling depots because chinese buyers cancelled their orders, as oregon public broadcasting",
            "Oregon recyclers have stopped accepting certain kinds of plastic because china has stopped buying them. Chinese recyclers are no longer buying plastic items with the numbers 3, 6 or 7 on them, and inspectors are checking for and rejecting shipments of mixed plastics from overseas. The list of plastics china no longer wants includes disposable coffee cup lids, pvc pipes, certain kinds of clamshell containers, and garden planters with flexible walls, to name a few. The restrictions have left recycling companies across u.s. Without buyers for many of the plastics they have traditionally accepted. They don't affect curbside recycling items like milk jugs and yogurt tubs, but they are limiting which miscellaneous plastics recycling depots will accept. Far west fibers president keith ristau said 50 trucks worth of mixed plastic from his company's recycling depots has piled up after orders from china were canceled. It will need to be re-sorted into individual types of plastic before it can be sold, as will the plastics are now being collected at recycling",

Shanghaiist reports the 24-year-old mother-to-be was experiencing complications from placenta previa, in which the placenta obscures part or all of the opening of the cervix. Doctors had told the parents the procedure would trigger the baby's birth and gave the infant almost zero chance of survival. But she remains on 24-hour care in an incubator. One complication: she's so young and tiny that her veins are not yet fully developed, making it trickier to provide her with nutrients. Xinhua has photos.

        "summary": "An actor in the predator reboot was a registered sex offender, and it was one of his famous colleagues who turned him in to the studio. Olivia munn discovered steven wilder striegel, a friend of the predator director shane black who'd acted in one of the film's scenes with her, had pleaded guilty in 2010 for trying to lure a 14-year-old girl online into a sexual relationship, and she alerted 20th century fox — which, she tells variety, initially didn't return her call. She followed up, and the scene was eventually cut. Since then, munn says she's \" getting the cold shoulder, \" as usa today puts it, from fellow cast members and black, who hasn't spoken to her. \" it's a very lonely feeling to be sitting here by myself, \" munn told the hollywood reporter during a promo interview saturday in which only 11-year-old co-star jacob tremblay showed up to sit next to her. \" i do feel like i've been treated by some people that i ' m the one who went to jail or i ' m the one that put this guy on set, \" she added. Though two of her co-stars, keegan-michael key and sterling k. Brown, note they weren't set to do the thr interview and that they support munn, munn tells vanity fair co-stars have dropped out of more than one interview and that no one else issued statements when she encouraged them to. \" right now the reality is that there will be people who wear time's up pins and say they support time's up, [ but ] there will be people in time's up who aren't really down with the cause, \" she says. Meanwhile, in an op-ed for mashable, adam rosenberg writes it's \" so very wrong \" black hasn't reached out to munn directly, and that she's facing the media alone. \" it's shameful that... She has to pay any kind of price for doing the right thing. \"",

June and her husband visited often. \" once my father retired, they would go up to murphy pretty much whenever they liked to. They would go for a weekend in the winter, \" said robert miller, june's oldest son. Miller says it wasn't until last year that his father had to sell the summer home in murphy. It was becoming too much for the couple to make the drive from florida. Eventually, they both ended up in an assisted living facility. \" he was actually her roommate at the facility, \" miller told newschannel 9. According to the obituary in"

        "summary": "A new discovery has revived an old theory about ocean water gobbling up ships in the bermuda triangle — if, that is, the bermuda triangle even exists. Researchers from the arctic university of norway say they've spotted large craters apparently created by methane buildups off norway's coast, atlas obscura reports. \" multiple giant craters exist on the sea floor in an area in the west-central barents sea... And are probably a cause of enormous blowouts of gas, \" they tell the sunday times. \" the crater area is likely to represent one of the largest hotspots for shallow marine methane release in the arctic. \" other experts have said gas blowouts from such craters, which measure 150 feet deep and up to a half-mile wide in norway, could explain the sinking of ships in a region between puerto rico, miami, and bermuda dubbed the bermuda triangle. \" there is a version that the bermuda triangle is a consequence of gas hydrates reactions, \" russian scientist igor yeltsov said last year, per the new zealand herald. Ice-like underwater methane can break away and form gas that bubbles to the surface, live science explained in 2014; yeltsov says it erupts \" like a nuclear reaction, producing huge amounts of gas. \" research has shown that such eruptions could sink sea vessels, as nbc news reported in 2003, and this youtube video appears to confirm that. But it's not clear these blowouts even occur in the bermuda triangle, the guardian notes. And skeptics say the gulf stream's many tropical storms would better account for the triangle's lost ships and planes. The very term \" bermuda triangle \" is questionable: still dismissed by the us navy, it was invented in a dramatic 1964 article that probed the \" mysterious menace \" behind ships and airplanes lost in the area.

He had been a registered independent and republican prior to that and even donated to the republican governors ' association a few years before his run as a democrat.

Trump, who has promised to restore lost coal industry jobs, has lavished attention on west virginia since taking office. Justice, who seldom worked with other democrats, recently spent a well-publicized day hunting with donald trump jr. — a familiar political optic in a largely rural state with a strong hunting tradition. But his move still blindsided his old party, which is now left with control of just 15 governor mansions. Rumors that justice was going to make the switch circulated throughout the day, but west virginia democrats and multiple national democrats who have worked for justice in the past said he gave them no notice on the party switch. \" we are sitting here in our office, everyone of us that is capable of standing on two feet, looking at each other, saying, ' oh my goodness, did anybody see this coming?"

            "Washington ( cnn ) democratic gov. Jim justice of west virginia announced his plans to change his political party affiliation and join the gop at a rally in huntington with president donald trump on thursday night. \" today i will tell you as west virginians, i can't help you anymore being a democrat governor, \" justice said at the rally. \" so tomorrow, i will be changing my registration to republican. \" earlier thursday, trump teased that there would be a \" very big announcement \" this evening in west virginia, a state that went heavily republican in the 2016 elections. West virginia sen. Joe manchin released a statement in response to justice's announcement on thursday evening. \" i have been and always will be a proud west virginia democrat, \" manchin said. \" i am disappointed by gov. Justice's decision to switch parties. While i do not agree with his decision, i have always said that i will work with anyone, no matter their political affiliation, to do what is best for the people of west virginia. \" read more",

West virginia gov. Jim justice announced a party switch thursday evening in a surprise appearance with president donald trump in huntington, west virginia. \"today, i will tell you, with lots of prayers and lots of thinking, i can't help you anymore being a democrat governor, \" justice said. \" so tomorrow, i will be changing my registration to republican. \" story continued below justice's flip is further confirmation of his state's sharp rightward turn, and reflects trump's widespread popularity in a state the president won by a landslide in 2016. Trump, who has promised to restore lost coal industry jobs, has lavished attention on west virginia since taking office. Justice, who seldom worked with other democrats, recently spent a well-publicized day hunting with donald trump jr. — a familiar political optic in a largely rural state with a strong hunting tradition. But his move still blindsided his old party, which is now left with control of just 15 governor mansions. Rumors that justice was going to make the switch circulated throughout the day, but west virginia democrats and multiple national democrats who have worked for justice in the past said he gave them no notice on the party switch. \" we are sitting here in our office, everyone of us that is capable of standing on two feet, looking at each other, saying, ' oh my goodness, did anybody see this coming?"

Russia's election hacking was raised during the meeting, but it does not appear to have taken top billing. Us secretary of state rex tillerson said trump was \"rightly focused on how do we move forward \" from the issue, while russian foreign minister sergei lavrov even claimed trump had told putin he accepted the russian leader's denials of involvement. Setting up a working group on non-interference in future elections – as tillerson said had been agreed – is hardly likely to reassure those in washington worried about russia's actions. A trustworthy account of exactly how the meeting went down is unlikely to surface: another win for putin was the makeup of the room. In addition to the two presidents, the only people present were the respective foreign ministers and two translators. This means there is no chance of leaks, as happened when lavrov visited the white house in may and it later emerged that trump had shared sensitive intelligence with the russians. The personalised format of the meeting excluded",

            "14: 35 guardian moscow correspondent shaun walker writes: vladimir putin is likely to count the format and tone of his long meeting with donald trump as a win – even if nothing much of substance was discussed. Russia's election hacking was raised during the meeting, but it does not appear to have taken top billing. Us secretary of state rex tillerson said trump was \"rightly focused on how do we move forward \" from the issue, while russian foreign minister sergei lavrov even claimed trump had told putin he accepted the russian leader's denials of involvement. Setting up a working group on non-interference in future elections – as tillerson said had been agreed – is hardly likely to reassure those in washington worried about russia's actions. A trustworthy account of exactly how the meeting went down is unlikely to surface: another win for putin was the makeup of the room. In addition to the two presidents, the only people present were the respective foreign ministers and two translators. This means there is no chance of leaks, as happened when lavrov visited the white house in may and it later emerged that trump had shared sensitive intelligence with the russians. The personalised format of the meeting excluded",

        "summary": "Exonerating women who are wrongfully convicted of violent crimes is no easy task — just ask kristine bunch. She got 60 years for supposedly setting the fire that killed her 3-year-old son in 1995, and struggled to find anyone who could help, mother jones reports. Finally, lawyers at the center on wrongful convictions at northwestern university's law school exposed a glaring hole ( and possibly corruption ) in the arson investigators ' case. That evidence got bunch released in 2012 after 16 years in prison, usa today reported at the time. Then two lawyers from the center, karen daniel and judy royal, began helping wrongfully convicted women based on a shocking statistic: women constitute roughly 11 % of violent-crime convictions but only 6 % of overturned cases. But why are women's cases harder to overturn? daniel and royal give their reasons: women are usually convicted of violent crimes against people close to them ( like a husband or son ) so dna evidence won't help; the suspect's dna is already spread around the crime scene. By contrast, men usually assault or kill strangers. An incredible 63 % of women's exoneration cases turn out to be accidents or suicides rather than crimes. So instead of finding a \" real culprit, \" daniel and royal may have to laboriously dismantle the prosecutors ' case, perhaps with new science on arson or shaken-baby syndrome that not everyone accepts. Sexist stereotypes are used against women in court. In the case of a woman wrongfully convicted of murdering her son, the prosecutor implied she did it to pursue a modeling career. \" that was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken, \" says daniel. \" almost every case has something like this. \" click for mother jones ' full article.",

And this is only her most recent travail: suh and two other women interviewed by the post were trying to flee their lives as sex \" video chatters \" in china, an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping north korea — either by willingly getting sold to chinese men to get out of their home country, or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in china, only to end up as human trafficking victims. Purchasing north korean women is big business in china for men who can't find wives any other way: the asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $ 12,000. Life in china is impoverished and dangerous for these north korean nationals: they can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per radio free asia. North korean women trying to survive there often fall into the online \" video chatting \" business, allowing them to bring in some extra cash from the safety of their own homes. But it's a demeaning, demoralizing trade. \" i felt so disgusting, \" suh says. And it's what led suh ( who brought her 18-month-old daughter with her, but had to leave her 5-year-old daughter behind ) and the two other women to try to escape once more — this time to laos, then to thailand, where they wouldn't have been able to be repatriated back to north korea. The two women being detained with suh want to eventually make it to south korea, but suh is applying for asylum instead in \" the strongest country on earth \": the united states.

        "summary": "For many, 2016 can't end soon enough. For everyone, though, it's actually going to last one second longer than usual. With new year's eve approaching, outlets such as phys.org are reminding people that an extra \" leap second \" will be added to the final day of 2016 in order to keep our earthly time-keeping measures in sync. No, this won't affect countdowns to ball drops — the second is incorporated into the day in far more subtle ways — but if you happened to watch the online clock counting coordinated universal time, or utc, you'd see the quirk of it going from 23: 59: 59 to 23: 59: 60, instead of flipping to 00: 00: 00. A more technical explanation: \" leap seconds are added in order to keep the difference between utc and astronomical time ( ut1 ) to less than 0.9 seconds, \" per the national institute of standards and technology. Wonky, yes, but for companies such as google that operate network time protocol servers, the leap second is indeed a big deal — and a post at popular mechanics praises the company's \" extremely elegant solution \" to the issue. Google will \" smear \" that extra second, as it explains in a blog post. \" instead of adding a single extra second to the end of the day, we ' ll run the clocks 0.0014 % slower across the ten hours before and ten hours after the leap second, and'smear'the extra second across these twenty hours. \" other cloud companies such as akamai use a similar approach but over 24 hours, notes pcworld, which expects this longer \" leap smear \" to be standard when the next leap second rolls around, probably in 2018. ( if you're planning a trip to ring in 2017 somewhere, this list might help. )",

I've tried restoring, updating, but nothing seems to be working. \" tech website 9to5mac posted a video demonstrating the date bug, which appears to only affect apple devices with 64-bit processors — meaning iphone 5s, ipad air, ipad mini 2 and the sixth-generation ipod touch, or newer models of those devices. Trying to restart the device seems to only bring back the apple logo screen, where it apparently gets permanently stuck. Apple hasn't responded to a query from nbc news about the apparent bug.

Volkswagen may be punished with more than fines: sources tell bloomberg that the justice department — which recently launched a push to go after individuals as well as corporations in cases of corporate wrongdoing — is considering criminal proceedings, which could involve executives in both germany and the us. The scandal has already wiped more than $ 16 billion off volkswagen's share price and the fallout could just be beginning. Experts tell the guardian that the use of software to cheat emissions tests could be widespread in other countries and with other manufacturers.

A joint investigation by the boulder daily camera and 9news calls into question former district attorney mary lacy's decision to exonerate the ramsey family. At the time, lacy concluded that dna evidence found on jonbenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the dna test results and lab reports used by lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from \" unknown male 1 \" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus \" worthless as evidence, \" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: dna samples on her long johns appear to come from jonbenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown dna may be the result of \" inconsequential contact with other people, \" reports the camera. With the exoneration, \" i was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice, \" lacy tells abc. ( the interview was done before these latest revelations. ) \" i was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence, no psychopathy, and no motive, the case was a train going down the track and the ramseys were tied to that track. \" comparison to the dna profile now in doubt was used to exonerate dozens of other potential suspects.

The new york times runs through some of the differences with airasia flight 8501: unlike with flight 370, there has been no sign that anybody on flight 8501 intentionally disabled any onboard systems, meaning that investigators should have the normal automatic transmissions from the flight to help the search. Flight 370 disappeared on a clear night, while flight 8501 was believed to have encountered stormy weather, with weather agencies having reported lightning strikes along its route. The airasia pilot's last communication with air traffic control was a request \" to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet. \" flight 370's pilot was very experienced, with more than 18,000 hours of flying time, while the combined experience of flight 8501's pilot and co-pilot is believed to be less than half that. Neither flight 370 nor flight 8501 issued an emergency distress call, but, as the ap notes, \" pilots are trained to focus first on the emergency at hand and then communicate only when free, \" and there's no sign that the airasia flight diverted sharply from its intended course the way the malaysia airlines flight did. Another major difference is the search area for flight 8501, which is much smaller and shallower than the vast area that has been searched for flight 370. \" we are not talking about the deep indian ocean here, \" says cnn aviation correspondent richard quest. \" we are talking about congested airspace around southeast asia.

            "A group of recently deported immigrants stand near the double steel fence that separates san diego and tijuana at the border in tijuana december 10, 2011. Washingtonmore than half of u.s. Citizens believe that most or all of the country's 11 million illegal immigrants should be deported, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on wednesday that highlights the difficulties facing lawmakers trying to reform the u.s. Immigration system. The online survey shows resistance to easing immigration laws despite the biggest push for reform in congress since 2007. Thirty percent of those polled think that most illegal immigrants, with some exceptions, should be deported, while 23 percent believe all illegal immigrants should be deported. Only 5 percent believe all illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay in the united states legally, and 31 percent want most illegal immigrants to stay. These results are in line with other polls in recent years, suggesting that people's views on immigration have not changed dramatically since the immigration debate reignited in congress last month, according to ipsos pollster julia clark. \" it's not americans ' views that are shifting. It is that the political climate is ripe for this discussion, \" after the november election when hispanics voted overwhelmingly in favor of democratic president barack obama, she said. \" democrats feel that the time is right to capitalize on their wins and republicans",

        "summary": "A 31-year-old texas man has died from flesh-eating bacteria, the third reported victim to be infected with the rare bug linked to hurricane harvey. Josue zurita, a carpenter helping repair flooded homes, died on oct. 16, six days after he went to the hospital with a serious infection to his upper left arm, khou reports. Necrotizing fasciitis had already claimed the life of a 77-year-old houston-area woman; a man who'd kayaked through floodwaters to check on neighbors and contracted the bacteria survived, per cnn. Dr. Philip keiser, the local health authority for galveston county, which announced zurita's death on monday, says the risk of contracting necrotizing fasciitis is \" well within what we would expect \" given the amount of construction and resulting injuries after the storm. \" you get some kind of break in the skin, and... It's a fairly open space where the bacteria can grow, \" he notes. The infection can \" spread over hours, \" keiser adds. Several types of bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis, which kills the body's soft tissue. The risk of disease following a flood is usually short-lived, per the washington post. But to prevent infection, it's important to treat even minor wounds by cleaning them thoroughly, then covering them with clean, dry bandages. Tetanus shots can prevent infection. Zurita was remembered in an obituary as a \" loving father and hardworking carpenter \" who moved to the us from mexico to support his wife and daughter back home. \" he's a very caring person, \" a relative tells khou. \" he was very young and always smiling. \" ( sewage in floodwaters was a prime culprit for spreading infection. )",

The investment buys a lot of self-driving know-how for ford: argo ai ceo bryan salesky worked on google's self-driving car program for years, while co-founder peter rander spent years with uber's program, cnn reports. Ford is now the majority stakeholder in the startup and fields says that while it is now a subsidiary \" from an accounting standpoint, \" argo will be given a lot of independence. Equity in the firm will be offered to tempt engineers away from other companies, the verge reports. Salesky tells the detroit free press that they spoke to several possible partners and decided they were most impressed by ford's vision for self-driving vehicles. \" when we talked to others, it was very clear that ford was one of the few manufacturers that really understands the full ecosystem that needs to come together for self-driving cars, \" he says.",
