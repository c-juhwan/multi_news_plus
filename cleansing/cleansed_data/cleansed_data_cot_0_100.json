In a letter to governors and state school chiefs, king says 22 states — mostly in the south and west — still allow corporal punishment or don't forbid it. He implores them to stop the \" harmful \" and \" ineffective \" practice, saying it teaches kids that getting physical is ok to solve problems. He also points out that some corporal punishment taking place in schools would be considered criminal assault or battery in real-world settings. About 80 groups — including the naacp — lent their support to a similar letter penned monday by the national women's law center, reports cbs news. \" corporal punishment of adults has been banned in prisons and in military training facilities, and it's time we do the same for our nation's schoolchildren, \" an nwlc rep says. King also notes that physical punishment isn't applied equitably to all students. For example, even though black students make up about 16 % of attendees in public elementary and secondary schools, they're on the receiving end of one-third of the corporal punishment. Boys are subjected to 80 % of such acts, while students with disabilities also tend to be victims more so than other students. \" these data and disparities shock the conscience, \" king writes.

More than 110,000 students, including disproportionate numbers of black and disabled students, were subjected to paddling or a similar punishment in the 2013-14 school year, said king, citing the education department's civil rights data collection. Corporal punishment is legal in 22 states. \"the practice has been clearly and repeatedly linked to negative health and academic outcomes for students, \" king said during a conference call with reporters.",

Now city officials have taken vantage energy to task for its \" unacceptable \" handling of the 43,000-gallon spill, wfaa reports. During a city council meeting yesterday, it emerged that vantage had taken nearly two hours to call 911 despite the risk of a gas leak. \" this is unacceptable behavior, \" says an arlington city council member. According to fire chief don crowson, the two-hour delay was no joke: \" we're not kidding around about the 911 issue, \" he tells the star-telegram during a break in city council. \" it could have ended in a bad outcome. Two hours ' advance notice could have helped a lot. \" still, officials say the environmental damage was not extensive and vantage has been cooperative. So what happened, exactly? according to the city's report, a vantage well site sprung a leak on april 11, which allowed fracking water and chemicals to boil up into arlington's streets, storm sewers, and streams. Because the fracking fluid had been fracturing shale and freeing gas under high pressure, natural gas could have leaked at any time. Now wfaa says a 1,500-gallon spill occurred at the same location a month before, and nbc-dallas/fort worth reports that the site is close to reopening. \" i just assumed this was a residential area and it would be free from industrial hazardous operations, \" says a resident after hearing about the earlier spill. \" now we see it's not. \"",

But here's where he allegedly diverges: according to cbs los angeles, 44-year-old gonzales has been dining and dashing at area restaurants, leaving behind unsuspecting women he's asked out on blind dates. Cbs reported in august that gonzales had left two women to pay the bill after walking out on restaurant dates last summer. One of the women described how he'd eaten $ 100 worth of food at a restaurant in long beach — explaining he had to order two entrees because he's a bodybuilder — before saying he was going to the bathroom. She never saw him again. Now, the man grub street identifies as perhaps \" the world's worst dinner date \" appears to have struck again. A woman, identified by wtol as beth, says she met \" dave gonzales \" on bumble before agreeing to dinner at a restaurant in pasadena. Gonzales ordered \" a glass of pinot, a caesar salad with a side of shrimp, a steak, and a baked potato \" and ate most of the meal before excusing himself to take a phone call, beth says. He never returned, a text went unanswered, and his bumble profile was later removed, adds beth, who soon after learned of gonzales ' alleged notoriety. She says she wants his \" disgusting \" ruse to stop. According to police, gonzales has also walked out of a salon, still clad in a smock, without paying for a haircut and color. He's wanted on two bench warrants as a result of misdemeanor charges, including petty theft. ( this blind date was more shocking. )",

The obama administration announced a $ 1.8 billion arms package sale to congress on wednesday, reuters reports, including guided-missile frigates, anti-tank missiles, amphibious assault vehicles, and $ 416 million worth of guns, ammo, and other supplies. The announcement came amid reports that the us had stalled the sale to avoid hearing about it from china, which still claims taiwan as a territory, per the wall street journal. Reuters notes the sale comes as us-china relations simmer over the latter's man-made islands in the south china sea and us patrols in those waters. China notes it's going to sanction the companies involved in the sale ( including lockheed martin and raytheon ), with a foreign ministry official telling xinhua that the sale flouts international rules and \" severely \" damages china's sovereignty. \" china's government and companies will not carry out cooperation and commercial dealings with these types of companies, \" a ministry spokesman says. A pentagon spokesman gave the equivalent of an eyeroll wednesday, per the new york times, noting, \" the chinese can react to this as they see fit. … it's a [ clear-eyed ], sober view of an assessment of taiwan's defense needs. … there's no need for it to have any derogatory effect on our relationship with china. \" meanwhile, the ap notes that china has issued similar threats before, with \" no evidence they've had any meaningful effect. \" ( all this despite a lengthy handshake last month. )",

        "summary": "One of your vices could one day be a little more virtuous: scientists are today announcing that they've figured out how to make chocolate healthier. The findings will be detailed by researchers from belgium's ghent university and the university of ghana at the national meeting of the american chemical society in denver, and center around how antioxidant-rich the sweet is. As a press release explains, it all comes down to tweaking the process. Cocoa beans are removed from pods, fermented in baskets, sun-dried, and then roasted. It's during that last step, the roasting, that polyphenols, which act as antioxidants, are partially lost. In a bid to up the polyphenol content, researchers added a nontraditional step that \" makes our research fundamentally different, \" explains emmanuel ohene afoakwa: pulp preconditioning. That simply means they stored the pods — in the case of their experiments, for zero, three, seven, or 10 days — before removing the beans and beginning the fermentation process. A sweet pulp rests between the pod and the beans, and afoakwa believes the preconditioning gives the pulp time to affect those beans. Indeed, the researchers found that those stored for a week showed the highest antioxidant activity after roasting — which they also adjusted. Rather than heat the beans for the typical 10 to 20 minutes at 248-266 degrees, they lowered the temp to 242 and upped the roasting time to 45 minutes, and discovered that slower and lower was also best in terms of antioxidant activity. The researchers ' abstract notes another benefit: \" pulp preconditioning and roasting duration could be used to reduce the astringency and bitterness, \" improving chocolate's flavor.

But just as connoisseurs thought it couldn't get any better, there's this tasty new tidbit: researchers have found a way to make the treat even more nutritious -- and sweeter. They will describe their research here today at the 249th national meeting &amp; exposition of the american chemical society ( acs ), the world's largest scientific society. The meeting features nearly 11,000 reports on new advances in science and other topics. It is being held here through thursday. Cocoa undergoes several steps before it takes shape as a candy bar. Workers cut down pods from cocoa trees, then split open the pods to remove the white or purple cocoa beans. They are fermented in banana-lined baskets for a few days and then set out to dry in the sun. Roasting, the next step, brings out the flavor. But some of the healthful polyphenols ( antioxidants ) are lost during the roasting process, so the researchers wanted to figure out a way to retain as much of the polyphenols and good flavors as possible. \" we decided to add a pod-storage step before the beans were even fermented to see whether that would have an effect on the polyphenol content, \" says",
            "Polyphenols are phytochemicals responsible for the astringency, bitterness, green flavours and antioxidant activities in theobroma cacao beans. Polyphenols degradation in cocoa beans during roasting is crucial to the flavour outcome and it is influenced by factors such as temperature, time and pod storage. Antioxidants are compounds that help to inhibit oxidation reactions caused by free radicals such as singlet oxygen, superoxide, peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite thereby preventing damage to the cells and tissues. Their mechanisms of action include scavenging reactive oxygen and decreasing localised oxygen concentration thereby reducing molecular oxygen's oxidation potential, metabolising lipid peroxides to non-radical products and chelating metal ions to prevent generation of free radicals in humans. The study aimed at investigating changes in total polyphenols, anthocyanins, o-diphenols and antioxidant activity ( free-radical scavenging activities ) after roasting of pulp preconditioned and fermented cocoa beans using standard analytical methods. A 4×4 full factorial design with the principal experimental factors as pod storage time ( 0, 3, 7 and 10 days ) and roasting duration ( 0, 15, 30 and 45 minutes ) at 120oc were used to study the changes in the total polyphenols, anthocyanins, o-diphenols and % free-radical scavenging activities of the cocoa beans.

A 4×4 full factorial design with the principal experimental factors as pod storage time ( 0, 3, 7 and 10 days ) and roasting duration ( 0, 15, 30 and 45 minutes ) at 120oc were used to study the changes in the total polyphenols, anthocyanins, o-diphenols and % free-radical scavenging activities of the cocoa beans. Variable decrease in total polyphenols, odiphenols and anthocyanins were observed with increase in pre-conditioning ( pod storage time ) and roasting duration. However, variable"

He zeroed in on trump specifically, saying \" do i like donald trump? no \" and noting he didn't see trump as a role model for his sons. And there's this: \" yes, i am supporting donald trump, but i ' m doing so as enthusiastically as i can, given the fact that i think he's a terrible human being.

Right now, sanctions include a ban on ballistic missile and nuclear tests and a ban on the import of arms and luxury goods; some in the country face financial and travel restrictions, and the new measures could expand them.

And since june of this year, those refugees have been living in what doctors without borders has called \" some of the most extreme conditions on earth, \" enduring temperatures over the summer that surpassed 120 degrees fahrenheit and watching humanitarian supplies and food come to a halt in june after jordan cut off deliveries following a car bomb. But government spokesman mohammad momani told the jordan times on sunday that while the borders remain sealed, a new method of delivery will be used: cranes that will lower the goods from the northeastern side of the border to the other side ( there was a one-off delivery like this in august ). And it sounds like the aid is coming just in time. Per the ap, the refugees are living in tents and suffering not only from hunger and exposure to the elements, but also from serious illness, including whooping cough and hepatitis. Last month, amnesty international released chilling video footage and satellite images that showed graves and burial mounds in the berm, per the washington post. \" many people have died, \" a refugee living in one of the camps told the group, saying conditions were \" awful. \" \" the mood among the people … is below zero. \" two anonymous aid officials tell the news agency there's been no final confirmation, but momani says the plans are being put in place to expedite the deliveries. \" the aid will be given to community leaders of groups of syrians so they can distribute it accordingly, \" he says, noting the aid groups will make the call on the pace of the deliveries.

The results of an ap poll released last week show that nearly 60 % of teens in the us have taken social media breaks — most of the time voluntary ones that last at least a week. Now researchers at the university of south wales have presented findings to the british psychological society that suggest even what are perceived to be straightforward perks of social media — such as getting attention via likes — may not exactly elevate the end user's mood. \" although this is just a relatively small-scale study, the results indicate that the ways we interact with social media can affect how we feel, and not always positively, \" one researcher says. To test this, the team reports in a science daily news release that it recruited 340 participants on twitter and facebook to complete personality questionnaires and then agree or disagree with 25 statements. Key findings include that people who go out of their way to rack up more likes tend to have low self-esteem and be less trusting of others, and that those likes don't actually lift their mood or how they see themselves. Previous research has looked not at more likes, but at more time, reports medical daily. It cites a study published in 2016 that surveyed 19- to 32-year-olds and found \" individuals in the highest quartile of [ social media ] site visits per week...

        "summary": "The body of a 19-year-old u of penn student was found last month in a california park, and as details of blaze bernstein's murder continue to emerge, so, too, does a disturbing picture of suspected killer sam woodward, 20, and the white supremacist group he's said to belong to. Propublica dives deep into atomwaffen division ( \" atomwaffen \" means \" nuclear weapons \" in german ), whose internal message boards lit up after bernstein's killing. Members both celebrated woodward as a \" one man gay jew wrecking crew \" and raged that one of their own may have leaked woodward's awd affiliation. Although the group is open about their hatred of minorities, jews, and gays — and their love of hitler and charles manson — it's a notoriously secretive bunch that doesn't take kindly to \" rats and traitors. \" propublica got its hands on about 250,000 awd messages from encrypted logs on discord, a chat platform meant for gamers but popular with white supremacist groups, with startling revelations. The messages offer a frightening glimpse into the group's leaders, where members are located ( as many as 20 cells may exist in several us states ), and what \" potential targets \" may be, including water and electric utilities. \" we haven't seen anything like atomwaffen in quite a while, \" a southern poverty law center researcher says. \" they should be taken seriously because they're so extreme. \" others, though, think while some members may be dangerous, most just indulge in \" magical thinking \" about government overthrows and spend their time reading fascist lit. \" it's very hard to go from talking about violence to looking a guy in the eyes and killing him, \" one expert says. Propublica's in-depth take also includes details on awd's supposed leader, who goes by the nickname \" rape, \" and the ire propublica itself received after it tied woodward to awd in a jan. 26 article. \" we really owe those jews at propublica, \" one member wrote in a chat message.

The girl was with two friends when the incident occurred, and they were all wearing life vests as they swam and rafted in the lagoon under adult supervision, reports pix11.

        "summary": "In march, ki ' ari pope drank boiling water through a straw after she and her cousin watched a video of someone appearing to do it on youtube and her cousin dared her to try. Early monday, the florida 8-year-old was pronounced dead after months of medical issues related to the tragic stunt. Ki ' ari underwent emergency surgery to clear scar tissue on her windpipe so she could breathe; after the tracheotomy, she continued to have difficulty breathing ( requiring two trips to the er ) and also talking. She had a doctor's appointment set for friday to be checked. But on sunday night, she told her mother's boyfriend she was struggling to breathe; she lost consciousness within minutes and was pronounced dead about an hour later, at 12: 15am monday, the south florida sun sentinel reports. The medical examiner's office is still determining ki ' ari's cause of death, and florida's department of children and families is investigating the incident. There have been at least 10 other dcf cases related to the family since 2008, the palm beach post reports, five of them involving alleged domestic violence between ki ' ari's mother and her boyfriend; it's not clear whether the boyfriend who called 911 after ki ' ari lost consciousness is the same one from those reports. At least one of the dcf cases resulted in verified proof of abuse or neglect, but details aren't available. Dcf isn't saying whether the girl's mother or other family members are under investigation, but a woman identifying herself as the mother's cousin says dcf officials took ki ' ari's three siblings away thursday.

        "summary": "Researchers think they've found a promising new potential weapon in the fight against malaria in a fairly unlikely place: the blood of toddlers. In a paper published in science today, researchers detail how they examined the blood of more than 750 children in tanzania. They found that about 6 % of those children had an antibody against one of the disease's key proteins, and that those children didn't suffer from severe malaria. Researchers think they can make a vaccine patterned on their blood, paul rodgers at forbes explains. Until now, most malaria vaccines have focused on keeping the disease out of the red blood cells it reproduces in. But this antibody is unique in that it instead attacks the protein that allows the parasite to escape the cells. \" we're sort of trapping the parasite in the burning house, \" says co-lead author jonathan kurtis — who suffered his own bout of malaria while studying in kenya while in college, npr reports. The team believes this approach could work in concert with existing vaccines. It's a refreshing, promising idea, one harvard doctor says, though she cautions that \" this is a long way from a vaccine that can be used in humans. \" it's been trialed in mice and will soon be tested on monkeys.",

Gaugler/science source for the first time in decades, researchers trying to develop a vaccine for malaria have discovered a new target they can use to attack this deadly and common parasite. Finding a target for attack is a far cry from having a vaccine. And the history of malaria vaccines is littered with hopeful ideas that didn't pan out. Still, researchers in the field welcome this fresh approach. Over the past four decades, researchers have developed about 100 potential vaccines for malaria. The best of the bunch is still only modestly successful in children, who are at greatest risk for the disease. The mosquito-borne parasite kills more than 600,000 children a year, mostly in africa. So dr. Jonathan kurtis, at the rhode island hospital and brown university, decided it was time for a fresh start. He had developed a severe case of malaria while he was an undergraduate studying abroad in kenya. And he learned just how devastating this disease can be, not only killing young children but causing hundreds of millions of cases of debilitating illness every year. Kurtis and his colleagues started with samples of blood that had been methodically collected from children in tanzania by drs. Michal fried and patrick duffy at the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. Kurtis'team carefully examined those samples to find small but crucial differences between children who got infected but didn't fall seriously ill and children who developed a severe case of the disease. \" we're finding the rare needle in a haystack, \" kurtis says. \" we're finding the rare parasite protein that generates a protective immune response. \" earlier vaccine efforts have produced antibodies that target proteins on the malaria parasite that it uses to break into red blood cells — the parasite reproduces inside those cells. But the particular parasite protein that kurtis isolated from the blood of these children wasn't part of that invasion pathway. Our parasite protein is critical for the parasite's escape from the red cell. And it needs to escape from the red cell if it's going to go on and infect other red cells and multiply. \" our parasite protein is critical for the parasite's escape from the red cell, \" he says. \"",

Michal fried and patrick duffy at the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. Kurtis'team carefully examined those samples to find small but crucial differences between children who got infected but didn't fall seriously ill and children who developed a severe case of the disease. \" we're finding the rare needle in a haystack, \" kurtis says. \" we're finding the rare parasite protein that generates a protective immune response. \" earlier vaccine efforts have produced antibodies that target proteins on the malaria parasite that it uses to break into red blood cells — the parasite reproduces inside those cells. But the particular parasite protein that kurtis isolated from the blood of these children wasn't part of that invasion pathway. Our parasite protein is critical for the parasite's escape from the red cell. And it needs to escape from the red cell if it's going to go on and infect other red cells and multiply. \" our parasite protein is critical for the parasite's escape from the red cell, \" he says. \"",

The privately held company said tuesday that its revenue dropped 5 % to $ 2.4 billion in the first six months of the year, mainly as a result of weakness in established markets like the us and europe. Profits slipped 3 % to $ 544 million. \" we are disappointed by the decline in revenue in our established markets, and we have taken steps to address this, \" said chairman joergen vig knudstorp, per the ap. He said the long-term aim is to reach \" more children in our well-established markets in europe and the united states, \" and added there were \" strong growth opportunities in growing markets such as china. \" the company, he said, needs to simplify its business model to reduce costs, though details weren't immediately available on what that might mean. Since 2012, the group has built an increasingly complex organization to support global double-digit growth. However, \" in the process, we have added complexity into the organization which now in turn makes it harder for us to grow further, \" vig knudstorp said.

Tmz has a screenshot of \" christian's \" profile, which described him as a life coach, dating expert, and massage therapist who charged $ 350 per hour or $ 6,000 per weekend, but the gossip site says the profile is now hidden or removed.

She was apparently unhappy after tmz's gigolo story, the site notes in a follow-up, but sources say paetz told her he really just coaches gigolos, and had only gone out with a few clients, for research purposes. But a tmz source says paetz had been working as an escort for nearly a year, and had gone on more than a few outings.

One of the biggest shockers from the event: research in motion is scrapping its name, and will now be known simply as blackberry. Other developments: ceo thorsten heins underscored the \" heartfelt and brutal honesty \" blackberry had to go through to get to this day, reports forbes. It's been a long haul for the phone, which is debuting nearly a year late. Heins showcased two phones: the z10, which has a full 4.2-inch touchscreen, and the q10, which has a traditional keyboard set below a smaller touchscreen. Heins said the q10 was created for customers \" that said we just have to have a physical keyboarding experience, \" reports usa today. The company also added some star power, announcing that alicia keys would be its new global creative director, a position created for her, the verge reports. The company also boasted that neil gaiman and robert rodriguez will be using the phone for a film and art/storytelling project. On to the features. First up was blackberry hub, the central interface for the z10. It has a tiled layout not unlike microsoft's latest windows iteration. Blackberry software honcho vivek bhardwaj also showed off blackberry peek, the phone's notification system, which allows users to check emails and calendars without leaving the app they're using. Bhardwaj also discussed the hotly anticipated blackberry balance feature, which aims to reinstate blackberry's dominance among business users. It allows users to maintain a personal profile on the phone, while a company can access the phone's professional profile. As for hardware, blackberry's camera now allows for face-to-face messaging. The z10 will be available in black and white, and zdnet notes prices will hover around $ 149 for a three-month contract, depending on the carrier. The phones will be available tomorrow in the uk, but the us will have to cool its heel until march.",

Alpha house was created by doonesbury cartoonist garry trudeau, who also writes the series about four republican senators living together.

Alpha house was one of just two comedy pilots to make the cut. The washington post describes alpha house as \" political satire \" in which the senators, played by john goodman, mark consuelos, clark johnson, and matt malloy \" live like frat brothers. \" it was inspired by a real capitol hill property in which democratic senators have lived over the years, and it's been kicking around in trudeau's brain since 2008.

As kyodo news reports, the princess ' family is worried about a money issue swirling around the family of her potential future husband, kei komuro. It seems that komuro's mother used money from a former romantic partner to pay for her son's educational expenses. Now there's apparently a rift between the two former lovers about repayment, and mako's parents, prince akishino and princess kiko, want it publicly cleared up before any nuptials take place, according to japanese media reports. This isn't the first sign of trouble for the impending nuptials. The couple initially announced plans to marry in november 2017, but abruptly postponed the wedding until 2020 and explained that they were rushing things. And when new york's fordham university announced that the princess ' \" fiance \" would be attending law school there, the japanese royal family chafed at the term \" fiance \" as the couple's engagement ceremony has not taken place, prompting the school to issue a new release without it. Assuming princess mako goes through with the wedding, she will have to renounce her royal status, though the guardian notes that the couple would get nearly $ 1 million from the government to help with that transition.

Tmz estimates the alleged thieves made off with roughly $ 330,000 in cash. According to south africa's eyewitness news, the suspects used ropes and chisels to break into a safe room. Stadium officials believe the break-in was an inside job, according to another local publication, the independent online. Fnb stadium, the concert venue, has a capacity of 94,000 people, and any thieves would've had to get past as many as 900 security guards. Tmz reports that bieber tweeted at the gossip site, \" it wasn't me, \" though any such tweet is no longer online. The believe singer has taken an astonishing amount of flak, some of it deserved, on his recent overseas trek. In dubai, his security guard deflected a teenager who rushed the stage.

According to a study published monday in heart, people who feel lonely or are socially isolated have a 29 % increase in risk of coronary heart disease and a 32 % increase in risk of stroke. While previous studies have shown a person's general health is influenced by their social relationships, this may be the first to show \" deficiencies in social relationships \" are no good for your heart. Medical daily reports researchers looked at 23 studies — a total of 181,000 people — about loneliness, social isolation, and health to come to their conclusion. The guardian notes that coronary heart disease and strokes are the two leading causes of death in first-world countries. And the new study shows loneliness and social isolation are bigger risk factors for those problems than either work stress or general anxiety. \"people have tended to focus from a policy point of view at targeting lonely people to make them more connected, \" the new york times quotes study co-author nicole valtorta as saying. \"our study shows that if this is a risk factor, then we should be trying to prevent the risk factor in the first place. \" the research is especially important as other studies show social isolation growing and young people feeling more lonely than ever before.

        "summary": "Doctors in south africa had a wrenching dilemma: a baby in desperate need of a liver had been on the organ-donor waiting list for 181 days and wouldn't live much longer. The child's mother pleaded with doctors to take a portion of her own liver for a transplant, but one big issue stood in the way: the mother has hiv. Finally, surgeons at the wits donald gordon medical centre decided they had no choice and performed what is believed to be the world's first transplant from an hiv-positive donor, per a university release. The surgery itself went well, and, more significantly, the child is hiv negative one year later. It's too early to say whether that will hold true permanently, but the news is being hailed as a potentially big development, especially in countries such as south africa where hiv is prevalent. \" this operation could be a game changer for south africa, \" write three officials from the university of witwatersrand ( affiliated with the hospital ) in the conversation. \" the country has a large pool of virally suppressed hiv-positive people who have previously not been considered for living liver donation. \" the piece details the ethical quandaries the hospital faced, including whether it would be right to deny the mother a chance to save her baby, even with the risk of hiv infection. The story is drawing international attention, and in the us, anthony fauci of the national institutes of health says doctors made the right choice — even if the child had emerged with hiv. \" if it is a choice between death and living reasonably well with a treatable infection, i think they made a quite reasonable choice, \" he tells the ap. ( a canceled hiv test resulted in a huge payout for one patient. )",

The deal incorporates michael dell's own 16 % stake, some $ 700 million from his investment company, $ 1 billion from silver lake, and a $ 2 billion microsoft investment. In return, dell will likely work more closely with windows, as was previously rumored. Meanwhile, four banks are backing the deal with $ 15 billion in evenly-divided debt.

And, facing pressure over the misuse of executive mansion resources for his family, mcdonnell recently paid the state $ 2,400 to reimburse it for food and household supplies his kids used, the richmond times-dispatch reports. Specifically, mcdonnell has been accused of sending things like paper towels and laundry detergent back to college with his children.",

Scientists think that bugs and plants have survived antarctica's ice ages only because they found warmth near live volcanoes, reports afp. They did so either in underground caves formed in the ice or by camping out on ground warmed by geothermal heat, explains livescience. \" volcanic steam can melt large ice caves under the glaciers, and it can be tens of degrees warmer in there than outside, \" says a lead researcher from the australian national university. \" caves and warm steam fields would have been great places for species to hang out during ice ages. \" the finding — based in part on the discovery that more mosses, lichens, and small bugs are found near volcanoes today — helps answer a question that has vexed antarctic researchers: how did species that have been in the region for millions of years manage to survive those ice ages? now it seems they waited them out in relative warmth before expanding their range again. The researchers say their discovery likely holds true outside antarctica as well, notes nature world news.

Finally, officers skillfully plucked the gun right out of brock ray bunge's hideout — without putting their lives in danger. \" the robot was a game changer, \" capt. Jack ewell tells the los angeles times of the department's $ 300,000 andros robot that did the deed; it's typically used to defuse bombs but is becoming increasingly useful in other cases. Officers say they were using the device to learn more about bunge's position when they noticed bunge was lying on his stomach with his weapon at his feet. While officers distracted bunge, the robot grabbed the gun \" without him noticing, \" says ewell. The robot then went back to remove the fencing, and bunge surrendered as soon as he realized his gun was missing, police add; he has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted murder and robbery. Though the robot that nicked the gun is expensive, \" when it saves lives, it is more than worth it, \" ewell says. Officers also used a robot during the dallas shooting.

Parisian city councilors have given the green light to a plan that would see the creation of a clothing-free zone somewhere within the city limits, the bbc reports. The location of the nudist area has yet to be determined, but deputy mayor bruno julliard — a supporter — said the intention is to prevent any disruption of \" public order \" and suggested two wooded areas, the westside bois de boulogne or eastside bois de vincennes. France is famous for its nude beaches, and proponents — including the mayor — say that nudists should have a place within the capital city. For a country that's said to have 2 million nudists, the capital has been a mostly unwelcoming place. Currently, nudism in paris is punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $ 16,800, reports france24. It notes a single swimming pool in the city allows naked swimming, but even then, only after 9pm on certain days of the week. Opponents worry about inflaming tensions between conservative and liberal groups, particularly on the heels of the burkini brouhaha. Despite those objections, the bbc suggests the zone could be in place as early as next summer.",

        "summary": "The attack on istanbul's airport that left dozens dead and hundreds injured tuesday was likely organized by a one-armed chechen terrorist who goes by \" akhmed one-arm, \" fox news reports. A news organization in turkey identified ahmed chatayev as the organizer of the terrorist attack, as did us officials, according to cnn. The news has yet to be confirmed by officials in turkey. A report released in october said chatayev was part of a \" group of militants that was planning attacks against us and turkish facilities. \" he is or was a top isis soldier, and the un says he has 130 militants directly under his command. \" he's... Probably the no. 1 enemy in the northern caucasus region of russia, \" us rep. Michael mccaul tells cnn. Heavy has a list of five things to know about chatayev, including that he claims he lost his arm while being tortured in a russian prison but may have actually lost it in combat. He spent time as a political prisoner in georgia and has been arrested in sweden and the ukraine in the past decade or so. Amnesty international helped prevent chatayev from being extradited to russia, where he was wanted, claiming he would be tortured there. Only two of the three suicide bombers that killed 44 people and wounded more than 200 at ataturk airport have been identified, but us officials don't believe chatayev was the third. The bombers have been linked to russia, uzbekistan, and kyrgyzstan. And while isis hasn't claimed responsibility, officials believe the terrorist organization is behind the attack.",

So who's behind the money? the new york times identifies the main player as a \" reclusive long islander \" named robert mercer. Mercer began his career at ibm but now runs a hedge fund called renaissance technologies, and like the koch brothers and sheldon adelson, he is taking advantage of the citizens united case that loosened restrictions on wealthy donors. He's \" a very low-profile guy, but he's becoming a bigger and bigger player, \" says one campaign finance expert. And his backing of cruz \"sends the message to other donors that cruz is a serious guy, \" which in turn encourages other donors. The times notes that mercer's hedge fund is under investigation by the irs, an agency that cruz would love to abolish.

The rapper unveiled both his new album — the life of pablo — and clothing line — yeezus season 3 — during an event at madison square gardens in new york city. The whole thing was livestreamed around the world. And, as with most things having to do with kanye west, it was all the internet was talking about. Here are five things you need to know about kanye's day: it was huge. The verge reports more than 20 million tried to watch the stream of the nearly two-hour event at one time. \" the early viewership numbers are insane … there aren't many other musicians who could pull this off. \" lamar odom was there. It was the former nba player's first public appearance since nearly dying following an overdose at a nevada brothel in october, according to people. Odom continues to recover from his coma and sat with estranged wife khloé kardashian after entering with the rest of west's family. Kanye made a video game. The verge reports it's called only one and depicts his late mother \" traveling through the gates of heaven, \" apparently alternating between her own set of wings and a pegasus. West says a lot of people turned down his pitch for the game. Martin shkreli tried to steal his thunder. The legally troubled \" pharma bro \" offered west $ 10 million for the life of pablo, hoping to delay or prevent its release to the public, according to the new york times. \" instead of releasing this product for your millions of fans, i ask you to sell this recording solely to me, \" shkreli tweeted. \" i believe you ( and your partners ) will find this financial arrangement more attractive than your current course of action. \" kanye is still super quotable. Cosmopolitan lists 16 of the lyrical highlights from the life of pablo, including \" i feel like me and taylor might still have sex / why, i made that [ expletive ] famous \" and — inevitably — \" i love you like kanye loves kanye. \"",

        "summary": "Much like in real life, matt damon's character in the sci-fi thriller elysium isn't too fond of government bureaucrats. Set in royally screwed-up los angeles ( home to the masses ) and an idyllic space station in the clouds ( home to the rich ) circa 2154, this flick from neill blomkamp ( district 9 ) has both the compelling themes and action-packed fight scenes to make it a summer blockbuster. So is it one? critics are split. The action sequences, complete with \" futuristic cgi flying machines \" are impressive, but it's \" blomkamp's critique of a society riven by class and racial differences \" that sets it apart, soren anderson writes for the seattle times. \" few mainstream moviemakers have painted as sprawling and densely detailed a portrait of humanity in extremis as blomkamp does here. \" but at the los angeles times, kenneth turan's high hopes were dashed. \" elysium is no promised land. \" though matt damon is great as always and the visuals are equally as impressive, \" the film doesn't feel as singular as we would have hoped. \" district 9 did a much better job of connecting genre ( sci-fi ) and theme ( \" socio-political concerns \" ). Even with the talented damon along for the ride, dana stephens at slate writes elysium \" does a little, sometimes shockingly little, with a lot... Blomkamp proceeds to spend the last two-thirds of his film crashing spaceships into lawns, or staging high-tech fistfights. It's a waste of a perfectly good dystopia. \" but over at the philadelphia inquirer, steven rea sees things differently. \" among the slew of recent futuristic hell-in-a-hand-basket spectacles, elysium takes the cake. \" sure, it can be a little generic at times — \" haven't we just seen all this head-bashing, hanging-from-catwalks, mixed-martial-arts mayhem in the wolverine and iron man 3? — but \" as summer movie sci-fi extravaganzas go, elysium is easily the best thing out there right now. \"",

Researchers asked men and women questions about their reproductive attitudes — things like when they'd like to marry and have kids and how much they'd be willing to alter their \" requirements \" for a mate in order to start a family earlier — and they found that the sound of a ticking clock influenced women's answers, possibly because it made them think about the passage of time. \" the very subtle sound prime of a ticking clock changed the timing with which women sought to have children and the traits they sought in potential partners — both central aspects of women's mating-related psychology, \" says one of the lead researchers. Women who grew up in lower socioeconomic areas were particularly affected, wanting to get married and start families even earlier — and placing a lower priority on their mate's status and earning potential — than women who were raised with more resources. Not surprisingly, men, who can typically father children well into their later years, were not affected by the clock sound.

Despite the fallout, carlson stuck to her guns, as it were, telling viewers that it's time to \"get real \" and address the gun side of the mass shooting equation, and calling out the \"intolerance \" of her critics: maybe it's time for more of us to start getting real and try to come together to actually get things done. Whatever you think of gretchen carlson's previous work, she showed true courage in bucking the conservative orthodoxy of her audience in the first place, but standing by that position in the face of blistering, perhaps career-damaging fallout from her viewers shows either a willingness to put principle above personal gain, or an underestimation of the potential of that fallout.

The tidbit surfaced this week during onyango obama's deportation hearing in boston.

Jay carney explained the mistake today by saying no staffers had actually asked the president in person, reports the la times. This time, they did. \"the president has not seen omar obama in 20 years and has not spoken with him in a decade, \" he added.

The marines have been pushing for this move since 2008, an effort complicated by the tortoises ' \" threatened \" status. Environmentalists threatened to sue, citing the harm that taking away 100 square miles of habitat might do, but the times reports the program got final approval after the us fish and wildlife service said it couldn't finish its review before the spring relocation window closed. A biologist with the center for biological diversity expressed concerns there might not be adequate food in the new habitat. ( this really old tortoise is the \" savior \" of the galapagos. )",
