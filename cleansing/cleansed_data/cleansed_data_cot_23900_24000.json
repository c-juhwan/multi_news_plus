            "Pirates have hijacked an oil tanker off the coast of somalia, somali officials and piracy experts said tuesday, in the first hijacking of a large commercial vessel there since 2012. The area where the hijacking occured is overseen by the u.s. Navy's 5th fleet, which is based in bahrain. It was not immediately clear what the pirates ' intentions are, but it may become one of the trump administration's first international tests. The aris 13 on monday reported being approached by two skiffs, john steed with the organization oceans beyond piracy said. The ship had been carrying fuel from djibouti to somalia's capital, mogadishu, steed said. An official in the semiautonomous state of puntland said over two dozen men boarded the ship off somalia's northern coast. Another puntland official said the ship was being moved toward the coast. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. A britain-based spokeswoman for the european union naval force operation off somalia, flt. Lt. Louise tagg, confirmed that an incident involving an oil tanker had occurred and an investigation was underway. An official said no ransom demand had been made. \" the vessel's captain reported to the company they were approached by two skiffs and that one of them they could see armed personnel on board",

Bates is the third judge so far to slap back the trump administration's attempts to get rid of the program. In his 25-page opinion cited by npr, bates also nixed a previous dhs motion to void his previous decision that the administration's reasoning for pulling back the program — which allows immigrants who came to the us as children ( known as \" dreamers \" ) to legally remain and work here with permits — was \" arbitrary and capricious. \" on friday, bates noted in his ruling that the government's arguments for why daca should end were still \" inadequately explained. \" \" a conclusory assertion that a prior policy is illegal, accompanied by a hodgepodge of illogical or post hoc policy assertions, simply will not do, \" bates wrote.",

And pence will be with trump tuesday at a campaign stop in the state, notes the indianapolis star. At the national review, eliana johnson gets why trump would love to have pence on his ticket — the governor is a true conservative, and that would help trump shore up support with those on the right who don't trust him. But why would pence be on board? johnson talks to his confidantes and susses out three main reasons: win or lose, it puts pence in a stronger position to run for the white house himself down the road; if he joins the ticket, it removes him from a tight re-election contest and a potentially devastating defeat; and he sees it as his civic duty to try to keep hillary clinton out of the white house. \"he would obviously be a favorite for a future presidential campaign after trump has been president, and that's unusual for somebody who didn't run himself in what was a very crowded and talented field this year, \" says trump pollster kellyanne conway, who is also described as a longtime consultant to the governor. Pence has long had his eye on the white house, writes johnson, and while the evangelical catholic may be far to the right of trump, he sees trump as a much better alternative than clinton. We might know soon: friday is the deadline for pence to remove his name from the ballot in the indiana governor's race, notes johnson. Click for her full column.",

In fact, the cartoon character created 40 years ago has a whole backstory that will soon be on display at an exhibit at the japanese american national museum in la, reports the los angeles times in an interview with one of the curators. For starters, kitty white is her proper name, she's a third-grade girl from outside of london, she has a twin sister ( they're scorpios ), she loves apple pie, and she has a pet cat named charmmy kitty. And oh yeah, she's not ( exactly ) a cat. The revelation, which has since been walked back a bit, made headlines: writes the la times ' carolina miranda in her own report, \" i grew up with hello kitty everything and all i have to say is, mind blown. \" over at the washington post, alexandra petri sums up typical reaction: \" if you were wondering whether everything is a lie, the answer is: yes. Everything is a lie. \" hello kitty creator sanrio confirmed the news to an incredulous time reporter and included her official bio, which features this gem: \" as tall as five apples, and as heavy as three, hello kitty is a bright little girl with a heart of gold. \" but after the uproar, the story changed a bit: rocketnews24 called sanrio's pr department, and the person who answered said, \" we never said she was a human, \" explaining that she's a \" personification or anthropomorphization \" — not quite human, but also not quite cat. Kotaku got a similar response from sanrio's tokyo hq: \" hello kitty was done in the motif of a cat. It's going too far to say that hello kitty is not a cat. Hello kitty is a personification of a cat. \" the site notes that the original story used the word \" girl, \" not \" human. \" either way, the upcoming exhibit is set to include hundreds of pieces of hello kitty art, merchandise, and fashion, including the famous lady gaga dress, and will be followed two weeks later by the inaugural hello kitty con at the museum of contemporary art.

To wit: a saudi scholar has issued a ruling warning against the pilfering of wifi, the sydney morning herald reports. \" taking advantage of the wifi service illegally or without the knowledge of other beneficiaries or providers is not allowed, \" was the stern mandate of ali al hakami, a member of the islamic religious council that advises the saudi king. He clarified that public wifi, such as that found in parks, hotels, and shopping malls, is a-ok to access. Gulf news points out that this most recent ruling aligns with one issued in april by dubai's department of islamic affairs and charitable activities after a reader on its website asked if it was ok to tap into a neighbor's wifi. \" there is nothing wrong in using the line if your neighbors allow you to do so, but if [ they ] don't allow you, you may not use it, \" the department advised. Not that this is the first odd fatwa to be proclaimed: rt.com notes rulings have also come down from on high prohibiting emoji, women sitting in chairs, and travel to mars. But some think it's pretty obvious no one should take something from others without asking — and that instead of a fatwa, saudis should employ a more common-sense tactic: passwords. \" we do not need a religious edict to pinpoint such basic things, \" one online commenter wrote, per the gulf news. \" private property should remain private, especially [ since ] the owner paid money for the services.

As of this writing, 91 % of critics on rotten tomatoes approve of the marvel flick, mainly because it does what a summertime movie inspired by a comic series is supposed to: entertain, excite, and elicit a few laughs. Examples: peter travers writes at rolling stone that, \" through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the cliches of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun. \" he adds that it's \" insanely, shamelessly silly \" and that this is the movie where a ripped pratt transforms into a \" full-fledged movie star. \" summer and cinema metaphors as over the top as the movie abound. Tom long writes at the detroit news that the film \" will pop your corn and leave you hungry for more, \" while david hiltbrand writes at the philadelphia inquirer declares that guardians \" is an open fire hydrant of a summer movie: more fun than should be allowed in hot weather. \" tom huddleston writes at time out london that the movie is like the \" box of chocolates \" from forrest gump: \" a vast, family-sized festive crate of chocolates, all wrapped in the shiniest packaging, all exploding with sweetness and surprises. \" bilge ebiri offers more of a backhanded compliment, writing at vulture that the \" very fun \" guardians \" is the class clown of the marvel universe, \" wistfully adding that, \" like most class clowns … you wish it would apply itself, because it seems capable of being so much more. \" and then — the naysayers. Mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle writes that the movie \" feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it, \" while kyle smith at the new york post calls the movie \" space junk \" and makes the wince-inducing comparison of the film to sci-fi fiascos howard the duck and green lantern.",

        "summary": "Picasso didn't just create paintings, he made silver plates as well. And a thief has made off with one worth about $ 85,000 from a miami art festival, reports reuters. Someone plucked visage aux mains ( face with hands ) from a wall at art miami — it was there when a guard checked at 10: 30pm thursday but gone when owner david smith of the leslie smith gallery checked at 10: 30am yesterday, reports the miami herald. No surveillance video exists, and because the plate is about 16 inches wide, someone could have stuck it inside a coat and walked away. Smith tells the miami newspaper that a smaller and far more expensive picasso ceramic ( $ 365,000 ) was hanging just below the stolen plate, so either the thief didn't know or figured that one would be harder to sell on the black market. As the stolen plate's name implies, it features a smiling face in the center, and stick-figure hands on the sides. Picasso made it in 1956 as part of a 20-plate series.",

        "summary": "You wouldn't know it to look at it, but a forest of aspen trees in utah qualifies as one of the biggest — certainly the heaviest at 13 million pounds — living organisms on the planet. And scientists say it's in real danger for the first time in millennia, reports live science. The trees are known collectively as the \" trembling giant, \" or pando, from the latin \" i spread, \" per pacific standard. The latter speaks to the unique reason it's a single organism: the approximately 47,000 aspens are connected by a single root system and genetically identical to one another. New trees spring up not from seeds but from shoots in that root system, explains the new york times. The problem is that a new study in plos reveals that pando is in marked decline — and that decline seems to have begun about 40 years ago when humans started developing the surrounding area in earnest. \" it's been thriving for thousands of years, and now it's coming apart on our watch, \" says lead researcher paul rogers of utah state university. Pando sits on more than 100 acres in fishlake national forest in richfield, and the specific problem is that mule deer and cattle ( cows are allowed to graze part of the year ) are eating new shoots. \" if this were a community of humans, it would be as if a whole town of 47,000 had only 85-year-olds in it, \" says rogers. When communities started springing up in the 1970s, humans got rid of natural deer predators such as wolves and bears, and pando is paying the price. One bright spot: researchers say pando is thriving in areas where unpenetrable fencing keeps the deer out, though that solution is an expensive one. ( in another part of the planet, the world's oldest and funkiest trees are dying. )",

It stipulates that candidates in a general election be a legal resident of the state they hope to represent, but the law makes no mention of primaries. Levene, then, picked three additional races where he thinks he has a shot. If he wins outside of georgia, he ' ll quickly work on becoming a legal resident of that state. \" i ' m a practical man, \" the 64-year-old told the atlanta journal-constitution in a previous story. \" i don't have time to do this two years at a time, since i expect to be dead in 10 years. \" the fec says the strategy is legal as long as levene keeps his fund-raising separate for each state, reports cnn. \" i ' m not carpet bagging in the sense that i want to take advantage of the district that i ' m running for, \" he insists. \" i will work very hard for whichever district that i ' m elected to. \"",

        "summary": "Researchers have discovered a way to give aggressive skin cancer what one calls \" a powerful one-two punch. \" in an international trial on 945 patients with advanced melanoma, drugs ipilimumab and nivolumab were able to shrink or stabilize tumors in 58 % of people for an average of 11.5 months when paired. Ipilimumab alone shrunk or stabilized tumors in 19 % of patients with the most serious form of skin cancer for just 2.5 months. The bbc notes cancer invades as built-in \" brakes \" in the immune system keep it from attacking its own tissues. \" by giving these drugs together, you are effectively taking two brakes off the immune system rather than one so the immune system is able to recognize tumors it wasn't previously recognizing and react to that and destroy them, \" the lead researcher says. \" for immunotherapies, we've never seen tumor shrinkage rates over 50 %, so that's very significant to see. \" one participant was told she had a maximum of two years to live after she was diagnosed with melanoma in 2013. \" i do firmly believe that if the treatment hadn't worked, i wouldn't be here now, \" she says. A doctor tells the telegraph that immunotherapy doesn't just fight melanoma. \" i ' m seeing this work in almost every cancer, \" he says. \" the potential for long-term survival, effective cure, is definitely there. \" but more than half of the patients on both drugs suffered fatigue, rash, or diarrhea, compared to 25 % of those treated with ipilimumab. And though the drug combo worked well for many, others didn't stabilize or improve. \" identifying which patients are most likely to benefit will be key to bringing our best weapons to bear against the disease, \" a researcher says. The guardian reports immunotherapy could replace chemotherapy as the standard cancer treatment by 2020. ( doctors are also fighting melanoma with herpes. )",

A janitor found a baby's body in a bathroom at south houston high school around 9pm on wednesday and school officials used surveillance footage to identify the mother, who was then given medical care, reports khou. The mother of the teen says neither she nor her daughter were aware of the pregnancy, which the mother suspects is the product of a relationship the girl had with a 23-year-old man who was subsequently reported to police. Their daughter and the man ran away together in august after meeting at a party; the girl returned home two days later and her parents filed a police complaint. Houston police say a sexual assault investigation remains open in that case. Some media outlets, including abc 13, reported that the baby was stillborn, citing a pasadena school district rep. However, \" we do not know the gestational age of the fetus or whether the baby was born alive or not, \" a rep tells the houston chronicle.

        "summary": "\" people don't like to think that older people have sex — but we need to challenge this conception at a societal level and look at what impact sexual activity can have on those aged 50 and over, \" dr. Hayley wright says in a press release. Wright and her fellow researchers published a study wednesday in the journals of gerontology that found older adults who reported having more-frequent sex also scored better on tests measuring verbal fluency and the ability to accurately see objects and spaces between them. The study looked at 73 people between the ages of 50 and 83. The independent reports 37 subjects had sex weekly over the past year, 26 had sex monthly, and 10 hadn't had any sex. The subjects having sex weekly scored an average of two percentage points higher on the tests than those having sex monthly and four percentage points higher than those having no sex. The biggest improvement was in verbal fluency, in this instance measured by having subjects name as many words staring with the letter f and animals as possible within a time limit. Wright says it's unclear whether the link between sex and improved brain function is due to \" social or physical elements, \" and more research is needed. For older people for whom sex isn't an option for whatever reason, the toronto sun reports exercise, managing blood pressure, and some brain games have been shown to help maintain brain function.

According to reuters, the ioc released a statement saturday after meeting in switzerland stating that e-sports \" could be considered as a sporting activity, and the players involved prepare and train with an intensity which may be comparable to athletes in traditional sports. \" it's a sign of progress for competitive video game playing after ioc president thomas bach previously said the committee was \" not yet 100 % clear whether e-sports is really sports. \" the ioc has been eyeing e-sports as one possible way of getting young people invested in the olympics, and the team behind the 2024 paris games had asked to discuss adding e-sports because \" the youth are interested, \" the bbc reports. The chairman of los angeles'successful 2028 olympic bid has also been high on e-sports. A decision on bringing video games to the olympics won't be made until after the 2020 games in tokyo. In order for it to happen, e-sports would have to be recognized as an official olympic sport, conform to olympic values, and create a governing body to make sure it follows olympic rules regarding doping, gambling, and more. Competitive video game playing brought in more than $ 525 million in revenue in 2016 and is expected to have a global audience exceeding 385 million people this year.",

        "summary": "Scientists have been scratching their heads over hundreds of baby whales that perished off the coast of argentina between 2013 and 2014, but a new study points the finger at a possible cause, or at least a contributing factor: pesky seagulls, live science reports. The study published in plos one says that kelp gulls off the peninsula valdes that have been feasting off the skin and blubber of mother southern right whales since at least the 1970s have become increasingly aggressive over the years and turned their attention to the babies. The gulls used to be more subtle: decades ago, the birds would simply hover over the water, waiting for whales to breach, then snack on the dead skin that sloughed off onto the water's surface. But they got brave enough to just latch onto the whales and peck away, making holes that grew bigger on each whale as time went by. Per the study, 2 % of living mothers and calves had gull lesions in the ' 70s; three decades later, 99 % did. The mother whales wised up and started keeping their backs underwater, but the gulls then went after the little ones. \" the zero- to three-month-old calves don't know how to keep their backs underwater, \" a study author tells live science. \" their backs are too small to arch, and now the gulls ' primary targets are the newborn calves. \" the study documented one calf that had lesions on 19 % of its back. Scientists note that even if the wounds themselves aren't causing the baby whales to drop off, fending off the constant attacks could take time away from nursing and playing ( crucial skills ) and affect how the infants fight off infection, dehydration, and other maladies — which could impact their mortality overall, per live science.

The frequency of gull attacks has increased dramatically over the last three decades and mother-calf pairs are the primary targets. Pairs attacked by gulls spend less time nursing, resting and playing than pairs not under attack. In successive attacks, gulls open new lesions on the whales ' backs or enlarge preexisting ones.

Yahoo news uk notes that japan's trains are \" among the most reliable in the world, \" offering a mournful comparison to britain, where \" commuters are only too acquainted with the daily frustration of late trains on the way to work. \" and the new york daily news notes things aren't much better in that newspaper's fair city, where subway delays collectively add up to 34,900 hours on the average weekday. The japanese company's apology \" is exactly what japan is about, \" sums up one twitter user. ( meanwhile, in nyc's transit department, leaking corpses on the job. )",

        "summary": "After fbi director james comey both contradicted president trump's claim that he was wiretapped by his predecessor and confirmed that the bureau is probing his campaign's links to moscow, critics including msnbc's joe scarborough called it the \" worst day \" of the trump presidency so far. The \" double blow \" from comey may have inflicted some real damage on the president, the hill reports, though the white house is trying its best to distance itself from figures with russian connections — and to make the real story one about leaks of classified information to the media. A roundup of coverage: politico lists five takeaways from what it calls an \" explosive hearing \" before the house intelligence committee. The top one: far from being a trump lackey, comey has shown that he is more than willing to buck the president. Republicans complained that comey didn't say when the investigation into alleged russian election interference would end, the new york times reports. \" the longer this hangs out there, the bigger the cloud, \" said rep. Devin nunes of california, the republican chair of the committee. \" if you have evidence, especially as it relates to people working in the white house or in the administration, that is information we really should know. \" the washington post lists winners and losers from the hearing. Winners include comey and rep. Adam schiff, the ranking democrat on the house committee. Trump tops the list of losers, because now, \" the questions about wiretapping and russia are going to grow louder. \" the ap reports that democrats are furious about the fact that comey shook up the white house race by disclosing information about the investigation of hillary clinton's emails, but stayed silent about the trump-russia probe. In his testimony, comey said russia \" hates \" clinton and wanted her to lose. Breitbart reports that rush limbaugh had a different take: on his radio show monday, he described it as a warning from the washington establishment that trump will face impeachment unless he stops trying to \" drain the swamp. \" ( comey responded to tweets from trump while he was still testifying. )",

That charge was eventually dropped, but their \" country, \" akhzivland, is still kicking. Located just north of the israeli city of nahariya, near the lebanon border, the 3.5-acre akhzivland has just two citizens ( the avivis ), a national flag complete with mermaid, a national anthem ( the sound of the sea ), and a house of parliament, the bbc notes. It features its own passport, and 85-year-old avivi is president for life — \" democratically elected by his own vote. \" even though israel doesn't recognize his state status, avivi's reign would almost make him the longest-serving ruler in the region, second only to the sultan of oman. Born in iran, avivi moved to israel at a young age. He became a soldier, fighting in israel's war of independence, but he soon became disillusioned and started his own state in an abandoned arab fishing village called akhziv, per a 2014 article in the daily beast. \" i loved israel. I fought for israel. But i didn't like the government, \" he told lonely planet in 2009. He's had some skirmishes with the israeli government over the years: he says he suffered broken bones when he refused to get out of the way of bulldozers trying to raze akhziv into a national park in 1963, and in 1971 officials put a fence around his property to cut off his beach access. Oddly enough, israel more or less leaves avivi alone these days, even erecting an official sign on the road nearby that points to \" eli avivi. \" \" i ' m stronger now than before, \" he tells the bbc. \" there's nothing they can do or say to me. \" ( meanwhile, texas secessionists make their own currency and prepare for an invasion by … oklahoma. )",

Audrey gibson and perry thurston says they were approached by the cuban-american republican over drinks at the governor's club in tallahassee monday night. They say artiles told them that republican senate president joe negron was only in the role because \" six n --- ers \" in the gop caucus had elected him, the miami herald reports. The senators say artiles later claimed that he had used the slang term \" niggas, \" which he considers a different term. It's not clear who artiles was referring to, since there are no black republicans in the florida state senate, the new york daily news notes. Gibson and thurston say artiles also called gibson a \" f --- ing a -- hole \" and a \" b ---- \" — apparently without offering alternative spellings. Gibson tells the herald it was the most disrespect she had ever encountered and she was so upset she had to leave. Negron said tuesday that he is \" appalled ' by the incident and artiles will apologize on the senate floor wednesday. Artiles apologized in a statement tuesday afternoon, saying, \" i unfortunately let my temper get the best of me. There is no excuse... And i have apologized to my senate colleagues and regret the incident profusely. \" said negron in a statement: \" racial slurs and profane, sexist insults have no place in conversation between senators and will not be tolerated while i am serving as senate president, \" he said.",

But the biblical epic, directed by darren aronofsky and starring russell crowe and jennifer connelly, is actually getting a lot of praise — even if most of it acknowledges that the movie is nuts. Here's what people are saying: \" noah is less an epic than a horror movie, \" writes ao scott at the new york times. \" the most potent special effects are mr. Crowe's eyes. \" crowe's noah is \" a genocidal lunatic \" who believes he \" has been chosen not to save mankind but to ensure its annihilation. \" yeah, this is a dark, risky film, because aronofsky \" takes the narrative and its implications seriously, \" imagining \" what it might have felt like to live in a newly created, already-ruined world. \" \" first of all, let's acknowledge that darren aronofsky's noah was a bad idea, \" writes alex o ' hehir at salon. But \" at least it's a bad idea on a grand scale. \" aronofsky seems to have realized how screwed he was, and gone wild, producing \" a grandiose and baffling journey that's almost worth taking.... When it connects it's awesome, and when it doesn't it's awesomely silly. \" it's \" like some hallucinogenic, parallel-universe version of the history channel's bible series, \" writes stephen rea at the philadelphia inquirer. \" noah is not, for even one second, dull. Aronofsky's film is crazy, bold, and, yes, biblical, \" though it's unclear \" how all of this will play with by-the-book christian moviegoers. \" but alonso duralde at the wrap thinks aronofsky has actually reined himself in too much to avoid ruffling the faithful's feathers. \" noah has snakes and bears and herbalist anesthesia and rock-angels and rampaging armies and panicky sinners, so why is it such a drag? \" he asks. It's \" a movie that will please neither the'son of god ' crowd nor the people excited about a reunion between the director and leading lady of requiem for a dream. \"",

And officials stressed that personal information was never at risk. \" our review indicates that the server did not contain consumer personal information; data was not transmitted outside the agency, and the website was not specifically targeted, \" hhs spokesman kevin griffis said. But it was a close call, showing just how vulnerable computer systems can be. It all happened because of a series of mistakes. A computer server that routinely tests portions of the website wasn't properly set up. It was never supposed to be connected to the internet -- but someone had accidentally connected it anyway. That left it open to attack, and on july 8, malware slipped past the obamacare security system, officials said. Related story: welcome to the age of hacks as health department officials describe it, the malware was run-of-the-mill, low-level hacker stuff. It wasn't even designed to steal patient data. It was actually malware meant to turn the computer server into a zombie machine, part of a robot network, or botnet, to spews out spam or computer viruses to the",
            "A man looks over the affordable care act ( commonly known as obamacare ) signup page on the healthcare.gov website in new york in this october 2, 2013 photo illustration. New york ( reuters ) - an unknown hacker or hackers broke into a computer server supporting the healthcare.gov website through which consumers enroll in obamacare health insurance, a government cybersecurity team discovered last week, apparently uploading malicious files. The centers for medicare and medicaid services, the lead obamacare agency, briefed key congressional staff on thursday about the intrusions, the first of which occurred on july 8, cms spokesman aaron albright said. The malware uploaded to the server was designed to launch a distributed denial of service, or ddos, attack against other websites, not to steal personal information, albright said. In a ddos, internet-connected computers are so overwhelmed by malware attempting to communicate with their website that, unable to handle legitimate requests, they crash. \" our review indicates that the server did not contain consumer personal information; data was not transmitted outside the agency, and the website was not specifically targeted, \" albright said. \" we have taken measures to further strengthen security. \" albright said the attack would have no impact on the second open enrollment period for obamacare, which begins on nov. 15.

But the new york times reports special counsel robert mueller is now in possession of the original letter trump, along with stephen miller, wrote to explain comey's firing but never sent on the advice of white house lawyer donald mcgahn. Mcgahn had worried the original letter could cause legal trouble for trump down the line. Mueller was given that original letter by the justice department sometime in recent weeks. People familiar with the letter says it is much closer to trump's actual reasoning for the comey firing. Sources tell the washington post that while the letter doesn't focus heavily on the russia investigation, it does include trump's complaint that comey refused to publicly say trump himself wasn't under investigation. The letter also makes it clear that trump had decided to fire comey days before getting recommendations to do so from jeff sessions and rod rosenstein.

To their shock, they discovered that daughter and father weren't related. That made no sense because, while the couple had used the now-shuttered reproductive medical technologies inc. For help conceiving, the husband had given his own sperm to be used in the process. Further testing then revealed that the daughter's real biological father was lippert, who had worked at the clinic in the late 1980s and into the 1990s. The wife recalls him having photos of babies at his desk, and she fears they were all fathered by him.

        "summary": "Arguments are set to begin this morning in obergefell v. Hodges, a group of appeals from couples in four states that will force the supreme court to confront whether gay marriage is a constitutional right in all states, the hill reports. Some things to know: per the ap, the court will hear extended arguments that are scheduled to last 2 ½ hours ( 90 minutes more than usual, the hill notes ). Also on the docket: to determine whether states that don't recognize gay marriage must recognize those performed in other states; currently, same-sex couples can marry in 36 states and dc, the ap reports. The four states in this particular case — ohio, tennessee, michigan, and kentucky — are among the 14 that don't allow same-sex marriage, the ap notes. A federal appeals court upheld bans in all four states in november. At least 60 groups of both supporters and opponents of gay marriage have been camped outside the court for days to vie for a seat inside, abc news reports. James ryder, who came with his husband, told abc \" we really never thought we'd see it in our lifetime. \" religious leaders yesterday called for the removal of liberal justices ruth bader ginsburg and elena kagan, per the hill. The president of the abiding truth ministries — who last week wrote on barbwire that the \" natural family \" must be protected by an \" angry mob \" with \" pitchforks and torches \" — said ginsburg and kagan's officiations at same-sex marriages creates \" an actual and blatant conflict of interest. \" ginsburg, the first supreme court justice to officiate at a same-sex wedding, has made no bones about her stance: in january, she predicted she had a \" strong hunch \" how this case will end up and that \" i would be very surprised if the supreme court retreats from what it has said about same-sex unions. \" justice anthony kennedy, who's written the court's three previous decisions on gay rights, will as usual be under the microscope, the ap notes. Kennedy — who's been described by colleague antonin scalia as \" a hand-wringer who agonizes over close cases, \" per the los angeles times — has repeatedly employed the terms \" dignity \" and \" decency \" in his decisions. Both sides seem to think the court will greenlight gay couples ' rights. \" we now perhaps are days away from this very court telling us that holy matrimony between one man and one woman … is merely a relic of a bygone era, \" one activist tells politico. The ruling is expected in late june.",

He let fly with this quote that's getting quite a bit of attention: \" i ' m not a scientist, man. I can tell you what recorded history says, i can tell you what the bible says, but i think that's a dispute amongst theologians and i think it has nothing to do with the gross domestic product or economic growth of the united states. I think the age of the universe has zero to do with how our economy is going to grow.... At the end of the day, i think there are multiple theories out there on how the universe was created and i think this is a country where people should have the opportunity to teach them all. I think parents should be able to teach their kids what their faith says, what science says. Whether the earth was created in seven days, or seven actual eras, i ' m not sure we ' ll ever be able to answer that. It's one of the great mysteries. \" reactions: \" how can you read that and not think ' iowa '? \" declares david weigel for slate. He references a january 2011 poll that found that 68 % of gop caucus-goers believed earth was created in six days and 45 % think the planet hasn't hit its 10,000th birthday yet. That makes his answer, that the earth was created in \" seven days or seven actual eras \" a pretty clever one. Rubio's continued reminders that he's \" not a scientist \" hint that he actually does believe science over the bible when it comes to the age of the earth, writes dan amira in new york. But rubio would \" rather straddle the fence between the religious right and the science-believing wings of the gop and fall back on a this isn't about the economy so it shouldn't concern me evasive maneuver. \" but it just makes him sound ridiculous. Actually, this was probably the right move, writes alex altman in time. Yes, rubio's answer \" will horrify liberals — not to mention scientists, \" but it could be \" shrewd politics \" when it comes to appealing to many gop voters. Then again, if the \" pragmatic faction \" of the republican party regains control, rubio may have just \" tether[ ed ] himself to a know-nothing strain of conservative politics that is bound to be expurgated as republicans reckon with what went wrong this year. \"",

It's unclear if the money was for his girlfriend, marilou danley, who was in the philippines at the time of the shooting; her family; or something else. Authorities are hoping to get the answer to that question when danley returns to the us. She is expected to arrive wednesday. Here are more new developments on the worst mass shooting in us history: nbc news also reports paddock was gambling with at least $ 160,000 at las vegas casinos in the weeks leading up to the shooting, though it remains unclear if he was winning, losing, or a mix of both. The reno gazette-journal has more on danley, 62, who worked as a high-limit hostess at a casino in reno and lived in an apartment owned by paddock during her divorce in 2015. Exclusive photos obtained by fox 25 show guns and ammunition scattered about the hotel room where paddock opened fire on the crowd below. Fox news has even more on danley, who is not believed to have been involved in the shooting despite paddock having some of her identification on him at the time of the shooting. But authorities are interested in interviewing her about a possible motive for the shooting. The islamic state claimed responsibility in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The atlantic reports this appears to have been one of the rare times isis falsely took credit for an incident, as paddock's actions lack many hallmarks of those carried out by isis supporters, but it remains unclear why it did so. Finally, the guardian profiles mesquite, nevada, where paddock and danley lived in a 55-and-older community. The town is described as a 18,000-person \" haven for gambling-obsessed retirees. \" paddock, like most of its residents, was white and rich.",

The us researchers looked into a long-term, confidential study about reproductive health, and found that 45 of the 7,870 women involved said they had become pregnant without ever having had vaginal intercourse or going through in-vitro fertilization, afp reports. Of those, 31 % had made a \" chastity pledge \" of the type popular among christian groups. The research was published in the british medical journal. A lead author explains: the subjects \" weren't asked a question ' have you had a virgin pregnancy? ' \" rather, the findings were \" put together from a series of questions about pregnancy history and vaginal intercourse history. \" she adds that it's possible some of the women \" did not want to admit that they had intercourse, \" or perhaps misunderstood the questions, seeing as the results are rather \" unrealistic. \" she adds: \" we actually found a few virgin fathers as well — which is a little harder to get your head around. \" livescience points out that the study's real finding is the problems inherent in researching sensitive information: \" scientists may still face challenges when collecting self-reported data on sensitive topics, \" despite taking precautions.",

In an interview with kara swisher of recode, zuckerberg was discussing the kinds of things facebook does and does not take down, and he said that posts denying that the holocaust took place would generally be allowed to stay up, though they'd get downgraded in the news feed. The backlash came swiftly, prompting zuckerberg to clarify what he meant. The details: original comments: in the interview — you can read the full transcript here — zuckerberg notes that he's jewish and finds holocaust denials \" deeply offensive. \" but, he adds, \" at the end of the day, i don't believe that our platform should take that down because i think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong... \" further explaining: swisher interjects to say that holocaust deniers might indeed be intentionally lying, and zuckerberg elaborates: \" it's hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent. \" he again says some people just \" get things wrong, \" and \" i just don't think that it is the right thing to say, ' we're going to take someone off the platform if they get things wrong, even multiple times.

            "Yesterday, i motored my ford fiesta down to facebook's headquarters in menlo park, calif., to interview ceo and founder mark zuckerberg. I had not done a formal interview with zuckerberg since he appeared at our d: all things digital conference in 2010, when the company was in its early days. Now, zuckerberg was ensconced in a massive building with a garden on the roof, part of an even larger campus that sprawled all over and was still growing. Also growing? increased scrutiny and criticism of the social network zuckerberg had built into a behemoth. It's well deserved given the sloppy way the company has handled a range of issues of late, including not monitoring how user data was abused by cambridge analytica, not stopping the russians from manipulating the platform in the 2016 elections and allowing false news from suspect publishers like infowars to be distributed on the platform. The controversies have landed zuckerberg and facebook in hearings here and in europe and have tarnished his nerd-god image. In this 90-minute interview we talked about a range of things, from news to data to privacy to china to his political ambitions. As you will hear, zuckerberg can cling closely to talking points, but he also did reveal more than he has about this annus horribilis for him and, well, the rest of us.",

        "summary": "The g20 summit may not be much fun for donald trump, what with the angry protesters making noise between his possibly difficult meetings with german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin. But he ' ll have a bit of a buffer beforehand as he first visits poland, where he's expected to receive a warm welcome from the country's right-wing, populist government when he arrives late wednesday, reports the bbc. It's no surprise why: the governing law and justice party is in line with the trump administration on major issues, \" from immigration to global warming and coal mining, \" reports the new york times. The party also sees trump's visit as \" tacit approval for its policies, \" which have been heavily criticized by the european union, per usa today. While poland is taking a conservative approach to abortion and gay rights, it's the country's apparent attempts to curb opposition — by using state-owned media as a government puppet and pushing a law that would alter how judges are selected — that have most irked critics. To prevent an assumption of trump's endorsement, critics hope trump will reference these concerns during a speech in warsaw on thursday. So far, however, there's no indication he will. National security adviser hr mcmaster says trump will \" celebrate poland's emergence as a european power \" and discuss \" america's future relationship with europe. \" also thursday, trump will meet with polish president andrzej duda and other central european leaders at the three seas initiative summit.",

        "summary": "Worried about tooth decay? switching to sugar-free drinks won't save you from the acids that destroy enamel and wear down tissues in your teeth, a new study says. Researchers at the university of melbourne reached this conclusion by having people drink sugar and sugar-free drinks, and found little difference in resulting tooth decay, upi reports. \" while reducing your sugar intake does reduce your risk of dental decay, the chemical mix of acids in some foods and drinks can cause the equally damaging condition of dental erosion, \" says study co-author eric reynolds, per a press release. In the study's first phase, participants consumed 15 drinks ( some with sugar, some without ) easily found in australian schools — and all of them except milk caused tooth decay. In phase two, participants downed water, coca-cola, and eight sports drinks. Water caused no decay and coca-cola the worst, while sports drinks like powerade, gatorade, and staminade ( whether powdered or liquid ) all decayed teeth; only endura and sukkie, which have more calcium, didn't wear down human molars. Participants also ate 32 sugar-free baked goods and candy, 20 of which had about as much acidity as sugar-free drinks; fruit-flavored goodies were the worst offenders, lemon-flavored ones in particular. The washington post notes that sugar-free gum is ok because it can get saliva flowing and actually help. But when it comes to beverages, researchers advise that you \" choose the most basic, old-fashioned way of rehydrating — water, \" notes the post. ( meanwhile, it seem the sugar industry has long meddled with cavity research. )",

            "The sister of the former tennessee teacher accused of kidnapping his teen student says her brother told her he did so because the teen wanted to run away, and he didn't want her to go alone. Tad cummins, 50, was captured last week after allegedly spending more than five weeks on the run with 15-year-old elizabeth thomas, his student at the culleoka unit school in maury county, tennessee. But cummins'sister says that according to cummins, the idea to run away was initially elizabeth's. \"i asked him why, why would he do this and the answer he gave me is that she wanted to run away and she wanted to leave, \" daphne quinn told nbc news in an interview that aired monday on the today show. \"and he didn't want her to go alone, and so he went with her so that he could know",
            "Cummins, 50, is due to appear monday at a federal courthouse charged with sexual contact and aggravated kidnapping of elizabeth thomas after police found the pair more than 2,000 miles away from home in a remote cabin in northern california. During their 39 days on the run, the pair was caught on surveillance video at an oklahoma walmart and police say they stayed at cheap motels with one bed. Cummins was thomas ' forensics teacher at their high school in maury county, south of nashville. Police say he had been researching teen marriages and was seen kissing thomas at the school earlier in the year. Quinn says she spoke to cummins three times over the weekend. \"he's done this horrible thing, that he has to pay for, \" she told nbc news. \"but he's still my brother and i love him. \""

Except that it can't go micro, because \" your friend list is just as bloated as ever. … you're still sharing with the same weirdos you've picked up over the years. \" so if facebook is forcing you to download new apps anyway, why not switch to independent ones without the baggage? feinberg has a whole list of suggested swaps, like groupme for messages and path for family sharing.

            "In the two years since its rocky initial public offering, facebook has become a strong business that regularly releases financial results that set investors ' hearts aflutter. Despite every hipster prediction otherwise, the company's user base keeps growing, and nearly a fifth of the time that americans spend on their smartphones is spent on facebook. That surpasses the amount of time we spend on any other single service by a wide margin — and beats just about anything else we do on our phones, or perhaps in our lives, period. And yet, when was the last time you swooned over some new feature in facebook? the two big products that facebook unveiled last year — home, an android lock screen, and graph search, a search engine — failed to catch on. And some of the most innovative recent social networking ideas have come from upstarts, which facebook has either spent huge sums buying ( up to $ 19 billion for whatsapp, $ 1 billion for instagram ) or trying and failing to buy ( $ 3 billion offered for snapchat ). Photo every time a new, much-hyped facebook product blows up on the launchpad, and every time the company pays billions for someone else's greatest idea, predictions of facebook's doom begin to roll in.

The state's attorney general said today that he plans to appeal last month's federal appeals court ruling that declared the state's ban on same-sex marriage to be unconstitutional, reports the salt lake tribune. Last month's ruling came from a three-judge panel on the 10th circuit court, and attorney general sean reyes could have first asked all 12 judges on the federal court to re-examine the decision. Instead, he plans to file an appeal in \" the coming weeks \" to the supreme court \" to obtain clarity and resolution from the highest court. \" of course, just because utah is filing an appeal doesn't necessarily mean the supreme court will take the case, or at least do so quickly. While it's a safe bet that the issue will be decided there eventually, the justices may wait for the five other cases currently on the docket in appeals courts around the nation to be decided as well, a law professor tells ap. Still, the respected scotusblog predicts via tweet that the court will agree to hear the case later this year, listen to arguments in march, and issue a decision in june.",

        "summary": "The washington post is out with what it's calling a bombshell monday night: according to anonymous officials, president trump revealed highly classified information during his meeting with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and ambassador sergey kislyak last week. The officials say the information had to do with an isis terrorist threat involving laptop computers on airplanes, and that trump revealed details that came from an intelligence partner without that partner's permission. Such a revelation could threaten the us'relationship with said partner, the sources say. Most worryingly, they say, is the fact that trump allegedly revealed the specific city in isis territory where the intelligence partner detected the threat, which could allow russia to uncover which us ally was involved. Trump \" revealed more information to the russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies, \" according to one source. \" it is all kind of shocking, \" says another. \" trump seems to be very reckless and doesn't grasp the gravity of the things he's dealing with. \" even so, the post explains that the alleged leak likely isn't illegal, since as president trump has broad power to declassify information. At a press conference responding to the post article, national security adviser hr mcmaster said the story as reported is \" false. \" \" the president and the foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries, including threats to civil aviation. At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed, and the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known. \" the post's full story is here.",

( the washington post ) the post reports on a stunning development: president trump revealed highly classified information to the russian foreign minister and ambassador in a white house meeting last week, according to current and former u.s. Officials, who said that trump's disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the islamic state. The information trump relayed had been provided by a u.s. Partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the u.s. Government, officials said. The partner had not given the united states permission to share the material with russia, and officials said that trump's decision to do so risks cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the islamic state. After trump's meeting, senior white house officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the cia and national security agency. Trump critic and former state department official eliot a. Cohen tells me, \"for anyone else, if accidental it would be a firing offense. If deliberate, it would be treason. \" it is not clear whether this was accidental or a deliberate attempt to aid russia. However, in one fell swoop he has told allies he is untrustworthy, thereby impairing intelligence-sharing that is critical to our national security. He has also dumped a bucket of fuel on the fire with regard to the russia investigation, suggesting he has some affinity or at the very least blind spot with regard to russia. Republicans such as sens. Tom cotton ( r-ark. ) and ted cruz ( r-tex. ) who continue to play defense for the president will now be put to the test. More responsible members including gop house and senate committee members will need to decide if they need to accelerate their investigation into russia meddling. And certainly, this breaking news adds a further level of intrigue to the unfolding story behind the firing of former fbi director james b. Comey. Moreover, it is interesting that someone within the administration felt compelled to leak the information, an act sure to infuriate the president. Plainly there are those in the administration who think trump imperils our security. We should thank these patriots, but also move to investigate and, if need be, remove the man who proves over and over again to be compromised or unfit or both. Update: thomas wright of the brookings"

The aspen times and denver7 report the 23-year-old mountain climber who'd been missing since sunday was found tuesday afternoon by a jogger on a nearby road. That person managed to find and flag down rescue crews who'd been searching for montoya; they first rushed him back to a local ranch, then to an area hospital. \" he's alive!!!!! \" his jubilant mother, lashawn bockus montoya, posted on facebook after getting word. \" your prayers and god's angels protected him!!! \" montoya had been climbing solo on the east face of the mountain sunday, and per his mom, he was about 40 feet from the summit when a chunk of ice and snow broke and sent him tumbling. How far was his fall? \" long enough... To do a lot of talking, thinking and yelling all the way down, \" lashawn noted. Once he landed in a snowfield, montoya used his good arm to dig out a snow cave to spend the night in. His emergency bivouac sack had fuel, so he could melt snow to drink, and on monday afternoon, he ventured out for help. He had to make another cave for monday night, and on tuesday he set out one more time and spotted the runner. Lashawn notes medical staff told her: \" no one falls down that face and survives, let alone walks out on his own power! \" in addition to frostbite, the davis enterprise reports montoya has a hurt hip and broken elbow. Nearly $ 13,500 has been raised so far for travel expenses for his parents and medical bills via a youcaring account. \" he is literally a walking miracle, \" his mom posted.

Instead, police say the 79-year-old mother and 57-year-old son were killed in october over 1,700 ounces of silver. Prosecutors have charged david wayne nelson with two counts of deliberate homicide, according to nbc montana. Nelson — a handyman with with a criminal record, per the post — was working in the bathroom of a residence belonging to beverly's deceased ex-husband. Gregory confronted nelson with allegations that he stole the silver ( valued at $ 26,000 ), according to the affidavit. Nelson tells police that gregory hit him in the face, and then he hit gregory several times with a hammer. Beverly entered the room and he threw her against the wall and ultimately strangled her with an electrical wire, he says. Afterward, per the affidavit, nelson threw the hammer in a river, disposed of the bodies at remote sites, covering them with sticks and logs, and cleaned up the crime scene. He faces life in prison, according to the post. \" this idiot is toast, \" writes one commenter on a facebook page set up after the giannonattis disappeared. \" god bless bev and greg, \" writes another. One friend tells the post beverly was a devout catholic, well liked, and \" very sweet. \" an ex-girlfriend of gregory said the fact that mother and son died together \" gives me a little peace of mind. \" police zeroed in on nelson after discovering that he sold the missing silver. As for the 25-pound bar of gold ( worth $ 480,000 ): supposedly a housekeeper discovered it in the house the giannonattis later died in. However, if the bar of gold ever really existed, it has not been found, the post reports. ( millions of dollars may be out there from this decades-old murder. )",

There is no real chain of command in modern american drug testing, the investigation finds, and many of the most problematic drugs on the market today have been tested in countries where the average wage is just a few dollars a day. \" the people doing the work on the front lines are not independent scientists. They are wage-earning technicians who are paid to gather a certain number of human beings; sometimes sequester and feed them; administer certain chemical inputs; and collect samples of urine and blood at regular intervals, \" barlett and steele write. \" the work looks like agribusiness, not research. \" and researchers question the relevance of the tests in the first place, highlighting the fact that people living in impoverished nations may metabolize drugs differently, and that outcomes may be skewed due to the presence of diseases like malaria and tuberculosis.

The 21-year-old online software vendor from guizhou province — identified only by his last name, hu — stole $ 1.9 million from video website youku tudou after he discovered a vulnerability in the site's payment system that allowed him to make more than 100,000 fraudulent refunds between november 2015 and april 2016, reports the south china morning post. He paid off some of his father's debts, dedicated cash to his own entertainment, and saved about $ 440,000, reports the post. The remainder, however — some $ 586,000 — went to more than 40 female hosts on livestreaming websites in the form of gratuities. \" although i ' m sorry to youku, i don't regret having done this, \" hu told a court in beijing after pleading guilty to theft, per time. \" i've learned a lot, which i feel is worthwhile.

Cnn reports bundy took out a $ 530,000 loan from the small business administration for his truck maintenance company in 2010. The loan guarantee he received is meant \" to aid small businesses which are unable to obtain financing in the private credit marketplace, \" according to mother jones.

        "summary": "Hillary clinton and bernie sanders will split the delegates from kentucky's democratic primary in a race so close that sanders might be able to ask for a recount, the lexington herald leader reports. The office of kentucky secretary of state alison lundergan grimes declared clinton the \" unofficial \" winner late tuesday with less than half of 1 % separating the candidates. Sanders, who won oregon by around 10 % of the vote, with most precincts in, won most of kentucky's rural counties, especially in coal country, while clinton took the cities. A round-up of coverage: a rep for sanders, who had been favored to win kentucky, tells the washington post that the campaign plans to take a closer look at the numbers wednesday before deciding on a recount. Cnn reports that kentucky results won't be official until may 31, and sanders has a week to request a re-canvass, which will involve checking voting machines. Sanders once again vowed to fight until the last ballot is cast on june 14, the hill reports. \" it will be a steep climb, i recognize that, but we have the possibility of going to philadelphia with a majority of pledged delegates, \" he told a huge rally in carson, calif., tuesday night. Clinton could clinch the nomination june 7, when states including california vote, the new york times notes, but sanders plans to persuade superdelegates to support him because he will be stronger against donald trump. The apparent win in kentucky was a much-needed one for clinton, and it is her only one this month, politico notes. But she now faces more than two weeks of trying to compete with trump and sanders at the same time — and with sanders now openly clashing with the party establishment, there is a stronger chance of a messy convention fight in july. Trump, meanwhile, scored what the oregonian calls an easy win in oregon's gop primary, made all the easier by the fact that all his opponents have dropped out. Still, almost a third of voters picked john kasich or ted cruz, who were still on the ballot.",

The result simply ensured that the likely democratic nominee wouldn't lose the two states voting tuesday, which would have opened her up to weeks of second-guessing and nit-picking from democrats concerned about her inability to put sanders away. But clinton's narrow kentucky win — her lone state victory in the month of may, and one that ensured she wouldn't go five weeks without winning a state — is a temporary comfort.

            "Donald j. Trump, already the republican party's presumptive presidential nominee, stormed to an expected victory in oregon's primary election tuesday night. The new york businessman, in an outcome that mirrored earlier polling in the state, easily bested texas sen. Ted cruz and ohio gov. John kasich. Partial returns showed trump picking up nearly 70 percent of the vote statewide. Cruz and kasich trailed with about 16 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Although both cruz's and kasich's names appeared on oregon's ballot, neither candidate has actively campaigned here since kasich breezed through with speeches in medford and portland last month. Both cruz and kasich suspended their campaigns this month after trump won a dominant victory in indiana, effectively making it mathematically impossible for either rival to win the nomination. The oregon outcome keeps on track a likely showdown in november between trump and",

It's not that she needed the delegates. The result simply ensured that the likely democratic nominee wouldn't lose the two states voting tuesday, which would have opened her up to weeks of second-guessing and nit-picking from democrats concerned about her inability to put sanders away. But clinton's narrow kentucky win — her lone state victory in the month of may, and one that ensured she wouldn't go five weeks without winning a state — is a temporary comfort.

Today's decision means that starting dec. 1, cigarettes will all come in olive green packages dominated by graphic health warnings with images like blinded eyeballs and cancerous mouths, reports reuters. The brand name will appear only in a small generic font at the bottom of the package. Tobacco companies, which fear the move will inspire similar laws worldwide and wipe billions from the value of their brands, argued that the law would deprive them of copyright, reports the sydney morning herald. \" no longer when a smoker pulls out a packet of cigarettes will that packet be a mobile billboard, \" australia's attorney general and health minister said in a joint statement. A spokesman for british american tobacco said the company was disappointed by the ruling and claimed that the only people that will benefit will be organized crime groups selling counterfeit cigarettes, as making all packets nearly identical will also make them easier to copy. Australia's health minister countered that steps will be taken to prevent counterfeiting, like placing alphanumeric codes on authentic packages.",

He outlines his successes over the past few months, including a recent new york times best-seller and notable fundraising achievements. \" but instead of celebrating... I found myself on the phone with the va's veterans crisis line, tearfully conceding that, yes, i have had suicidal thoughts. And it wasn't the first time, \" he notes. He says he decided to go public about his mental health to help both himself and others who might be similarly struggling. \" once i work through my mental health challenges, i fully intend to be working shoulder to shoulder with all of you again, \" he writes.

Assault — usually by someone known to the victim — accounted for 96 % of the injuries, and 10 % included multiple attackers.

        "summary": "If you lose your lunch in an uber, it's only fair that you pay for the cleanup. But many users of the rideshare service say they were charged steep cleaning fees ( ostensibly so drivers can have their cars professionally cleaned ) even though they didn't make a mess. So-called \" vomit fraud \" can increase the cost of a ride by $ 80 to more than $ 150, according to the miami herald. Uber's default position is to side with its drivers, who supply photos of vehicle interiors spattered with vomit and other messes as evidence. Riders, meanwhile, report having a difficult time getting uber to investigate complaints and issue refunds. Uber tells the herald's spanish-language sister paper, el nuevo herald, that fraud does occur, but adds that more often than not, cleaning fees are \" legitimately the result of someone making a mess in the car. \" last summer, uber hit florida resident david shoultz with a $ 165 cleaning fee. He tells wpyv that uber responded to his allegations of fraud by forwarding \" two photos that don't look anything like the car i rode in, but there was vomit everywhere. \" uber ultimately refunded the cleaning fee, but only after shoultz broadcast his frustrations on social media. It's not just a us problem: an australian woman, who said she had a similar experience earlier this year, suggests that riders take photos of the car's interior so they can prove it was clean when they left, news.com.au reports. In a 2017 report, business insider profiled a san diego uber driver who is making a little extra cash from cleaning fees in a different way. Will preston does the cleanup himself and pockets the fee.
