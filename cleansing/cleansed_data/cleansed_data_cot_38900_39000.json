        "summary": "In a move that is roiling the telecom industry worldwide, a global telecom equipment-maker has halted its main business operations. The announcement comes after zte, china's second-largest telecom equipment company, was found by the us to have illegally shipped its products to iran, per reuters. In response, the us department of commerce banned us firms from supplying tech and parts to the company until 2025, according to the new york times. Zte relies heavily on us companies to supply as much as a third of its components. Those companies include san diego-based qualcomm, which supplies processors for more than half of zte's smartphones, per quartz. Zte, the fourth-largest smartphone vendor in the us, does business with more than 160 countries and employs 75,000 people; the times calls it the \" biggest electronics maker you've never heard of. \" saying it has improved its compliance, zte has asked for a stay on the ban and supplied supplemental data bolstering its case to the commerce department. But the commerce department has asserted that zte's practices were egregious and included a surreptitious system to sell american-made goods in iran. Then, to hide its activities, zte allegedly lied and deleted emails to cover its tracks and actively sought to resume shipments during the investigation. Zte had settled its sanctions case with the us with a record $ 900 million fine, but the us reactivated sanctions last month after the company allegedly violated settlement terms. \"for other companies thinking about how to follow the rules and manage internal risks, i think this is going to serve as a wakeup call, \" a market researcher tells the times. For now, zte's manufacturing is halted, leaving employees to attend every-other-day training sessions and hang out in company dorms.",

The video, taken from an nbc news helicopter, starts with the suspect in the frame on a horse before he topples off. A deputy appears to taser him, and the incident seems over as the suspect lies on the ground with arms stretched out. Except instead of cuffing him and concluding the chase, two deputies appear to start punching and kneeing the suspect. The group of deputies eventually grows to 11; nbc los angeles counts a total of 17 kicks, 37 punches, and four swats with a baton; 13 strikes appear to be to the suspect's head. \" the video surrounding this arrest is disturbing, \" sheriff john mcmahon said in a statement last night, per the san bernardino sun. \" i have ordered an internal investigation be conducted immediately. \" officers had gone to a local home earlier that day with a search warrant related to an id theft case when the suspect, 30-year-old francis jared pusok, took off in his car, cops say, per the sun. After a chase that eventually led pusok to ditch his vehicle, he fled on foot until he allegedly stole the horse. Authorities say pusok is in the hospital with \" unknown \" injuries; his girlfriend tells nbc los angeles she's not only in the dark about how bad his injuries are, but she hasn't even been told what hospital he's at. The horse was also said to be injured by the \" very rugged, steep \" terrain it traversed. Pusok's lawyer doesn't mince words: \" this is far worse than rodney king, \" he tells cbs los angeles.",

Nurses and midwives met with her along the way, and before giving birth to son earl reese-thornton jr. On dec. 2, 2013, things had been progressing well. The birth, she alleged in a lawsuit, was disastrous. Earl jr. Had to be revived after entering the world and suffered permanent severe brain damage due to lack of oxygen. The judge agreed dr. Ata atogho was at fault, with the verdict noting he left her room for extended spells, once to speak to his stockbroker for eight minutes; with fetal heart rate monitors indicating the baby was in severe distress, the doctor also should have performed a c-section but didn't. The $ 33.8 million dixon and her child will receive as a result won't cost atogho a penny. That's because he wasn't the one being sued; rather, the us government was, as it's liable for any injuries its medical employees cause, explains the miami herald. Not only does dixon say atogho never apologized, she also says he lied, something backed up by the testimony of a nurse who noted atogho wrote \" refused c/s \" [ that's c-section ] in dixon's medical records; on the contrary, the nurse testified she yelled, \" just cut me. \" local 10 reports the judge in his order cited a defense expert who says the child will live only nine to 12 more years. Though the head of jessie trice says atogho is no longer connected to its centers, he has not been reprimanded and his florida medical license is currently \" clear and active. \" this in spite of three other teen moms who have sued over babies delivered by atogho in 2013 who ended up brain damaged or disabled.

U.s. District judge robert n. Scola awarded the baby's mother, marla dixon, $ 3.3 million, and the father, earl reese-thornton, $ 1.1 million for their pain and suffering. Scola awarded $ 21.7 million for the boy's economic damages and $ 7.6 million for his pain and suffering. Dixon was a patient at jessie trice community health center in miami gardens. Dr. Ata atogho was the on-call physician at the community center, which provides care to the uninsured and undocumented with the help of federal funding. While she was at north shore medical center, dixon was also under the care of an experienced labor and delivery nurse. She testified that atogho's claims that he offered dixon a cesarean section and that she declined were false. Both the nurse and reese-thornton testified that the 19-year-old mother was yelling, \" just cut me! \" the nurse said atogho ignored her request despite the baby's slowed heart rate and left dixon for another delivery.

Patrick's day ads it put up around the toronto subway system's st. Patrick station used the wrong green symbol to commemorate the holiday, huffington post canada reports. Next to the canadian maple leaf used to illustrate march 16 on the poster, guinness put the \" preferred foliage \" of a four-leaf clover to symbolize march 17. Alas, it's not the clover that represents the irish holiday: ireland's patron saint used a three-leafed shamrock to mark the holy trinity and to help spread the word of catholicism, the irish times notes. An irish man in toronto alerted guinness canada to the error, per the daily edge, and the company said it simply got overexcited prepping for the big day and would take the posters down.

It has since led them to brittney gargol's killer: her best friend. Initially charged with second-degree murder, cheyanne antoine, 21, pleaded guilty to manslaughter monday in saskatchewan after she was seen wearing the belt alongside gargol in a selfie posted to facebook six hours before gargol's body was found, report the cbc and saskatoon starphoenix. Antoine, who'd also posted on gargol's facebook page saying she hoped her friend \" made it home safe, \" first told police the pair had separated after a night of drinking. She later admitted they'd argued before antoine strangled gargol, leaving her body near a landfill, though she said she didn't recall the killing. A defense attorney said her client's last memory from the night of march 25, 2015, was gargol taking antoine's phone after the pair left a house party. She also described antoine as a victim of abuse who turned to alcohol and drugs for comfort, per the starphoenix. \" my client had some very deep, personal issues that she was not dealing with, and unfortunately they turned into a very tragic situation for all involved, \" she said. Prosecutors and the defense agreed to a seven-year sentence after antoine expressed remorse, reports the bbc. \" i will never forgive myself, \" she said in a statement. \" nothing i say or do will ever bring her back. I am very, very sorry. \" while accepting the sentence, judge marilyn gray told antoine to \" honor your friend by becoming a positive member of the community. You owe it to her. \" ( a 20-year-old is accused of killing his friend. )",

Politico spoke to three dozen people close to ryan, and none of them believed the speaker of the house would still be in congress after 2018. On the verge of passing tax reform — one of his major goals since entering congress in 1999 — sources say ryan wants to use 2018 to tackle his other, more politically risky goal: reforms to social security, medicare, and the rest of the social safety net. They say ryan would serve through 2018, then retire before the next congress is seated. Sources say ryan doesn't want to campaign alongside trump in 2020, \" feels like he's running a daycare, \" and wants to spend time with his actual children instead. Close friends tell cnn ryan is suffering from \" trump-haustion. \" but it's no guarantee ryan will even last that long. The next few weeks in congress — with success needed on tax reform, government funding, and more — could sink the speaker. He's reportedly told some close to him that his current strategy is short term: \"win the day. Win the next day. And then win the week. \" during his weekly press conference thursday, ryan denied that he's quitting congress \" soon, \" the hill reports. \" i ain't goin ' anywhere, \" he told reporters when asked about the rumors.

The incident happened in march of 2015 during a bar mitzvah celebration at a north scottsdale home of one of the teen's family. The teens claimed she exposed her newly-enhanced breasts and engaged in sexual misconduct with more than half a dozen boys, ages 11 to 15. However, radomski maintained that she has no memory of what happened at the party. Her attorney said she was given a \" date rape \" drug that night. The maricopa county attorney's office declined the case, but a city of scottsdale prosecutor charged radomski with 18 misdemeanor counts of sexual assault and molestation. Following a seven-week trial, where radomski and all the boys testified, she was found not guilty of all charges in september of last year.

The fatwa from the sunni insurgents, who overtook the northern iraqi city in june, applies to females between the ages of 11 and 46 and could potentially affect 4 million women and girls in the area, according to the bbc. But, as reuters points out, some are skeptical of the report, and the un says it is still investigating. Fgm procedures \"intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons, \" offering zero health benefits and potentially causing hemorrhaging, urinary issues, and infertility, says the world health organization. As the un spokeswoman notes, the city of mosul isn't accustomed to the brutal practice, which the un general assembly banned in member states in 2012. \"this is not the will of iraqi people, or the women of iraq in these vulnerable areas covered by the terrorists, \" the un rep told reporters via video from irbil.",

In an effort to solve its 2012 mystery, atlas logistics group retail services — which operates warehouses that store products en route to grocery stores — swabbed some of its employees to collect their dna. Jack lowe and dennis reynolds were two of them, and their dna didn't match that taken from the poop, which had been found in the aisles and on canned goods. So they sued. Courthouse news service reports that they cited the genetic information nondiscrimination act, which \" generally prohibits \" a company from asking its workers to hand over their genetic info. Last month, us district judge amy totenberg determined atlas did indeed seek and obtain such info as outlined by gina, even though the test didn't disclose any medical details. She denied atlas ' motion for summary judgement, and the new york times spoke to legal experts who believed this to be the only case involving gina to go to trial.

( cnn ) -- joran van der sloot on friday asked for more time to \" reflect \" on what plea he will make during his murder trial, shortly after his attorney indicating the 24-year-old dutch man suddenly had changed his strategy in relation to the killing. Earlier in the day, his attorney said van der sloot was expected to plead guilty to all charges, but when it came time to tell the court, he asked instead for more time. When asked for a plea by the magistrates, van der sloot said he wanted to give a \" sincere confession \" -- a type of guilty plea that can qualify him for a reduced sentence -- but did not agree with all of the charges against him. When the judge asked for clarification, he said he needed more time to decide his plea. The trial is postponed until wednesday, when van der sloot is expected to finally give his plea. He is charged with \" qualified murder \" and simple robbery in the killing of 21-year-old stephany flores. On friday, prosecutors went over all the evidence and witnesses they had and gave a summation of the case against van der sloot. The dutch national was considered"

Even syria's longtime ally, russia, appears to be losing patience with the syrian leadership, and condemned the attack, which was followed by more killings in hama. Increasing criticism from russia appears to be a clear message to assad to change course or lose moscow's support, reports ap. \" the government bears the main responsibility for what is going on, \" foreign minister sergey lavrov said in moscow yesterday following a meeting with british foreign secretary william hague. \" any government in any country bears responsibility for the security of its citizens. \" assad \" is driving himself and russia into a corner, \" said middle east expert alexei malashenko. \" bashar has definitely gotten the sense that he may lose russia's sympathy, and he may step back a bit. \"",

That's what happened last night when birdman won over boyhood.

But boyhood has earned the title \" masterpiece, \" and its loss stings differently. \" ten, 20, 50 years from now, we ' ll look back, and slap our heads and say, how did they let this happen? \" his full column is worth a read.",

The flurry of subpoenas came a day after us district court judge peter j. Messitte approved a brisk schedule for discovery in the case alleging that foreign and domestic government spending at trump's washington, dc, hotel amounts to gifts to the president in violation of the constitution's emoluments clause. The subpoenas target 37 entities, including 13 trump-linked entities and the federal agency that oversees the lease for trump's washington hotel. Subpoenas were also being sent to the department of defense, general services administration, department of commerce and department of agriculture, all of which have spent taxpayer dollars at the hotel or have information on trump's finances relevant to the case. Other trump entities that officials plan to subpoena include those related to his washington hotel and its management. Eighteen private entities including restaurants, venues and hotels that compete with the trump hotel are also being subpoenaed to \" illuminate the unfair nature of that competition, \" said maryland attorney general brian e. Frosh. \" we're seeking to confirm the information that everybody already knows: trump's violation of the emoluments clause of the constitution, \" frosh said. \" he's received numerous payments from foreign governments and state governments and they've been funneled, at least in part, through the trump ( hotel ) in dc. \" while news organizations have reported how groups representing saudi arabia, kuwait, bahrain and the philippines have hosted events at trump's dc hotel since he took office, the subpoenas offer the best chance to get a complete picture of which foreign and domestic governments are spending at the hotel, how much they are spending, and where that money is going.

The \" commander-in-chief \" forum, hosted by nbc news and the iraq and afghanistan veterans of america at the intrepid sea, air, and space museum in new york, was hosted by the today show's matt lauer. Clinton and trump fielded questions and spoke back-to-back, with clinton going first after winning a coin flip. A round-up of coverage: according to nbc, the night will be remembered for trump offering more praise for vladimir putin than for america's \" embarrassing \" military leadership. Putin has \" been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader, \" said trump, who praised the russian leader's 82 % approval rating. \" we have a divided country. \" clinton cast herself as a model of \" absolute rock steadiness \" in foreign policy compared to trump, reports the washington post, which notes that she seemed \" guarded, even stilted \" when dealing with questions about her email server and her vote for the iraq war. Clinton said the iraq vote and the email server were both mistakes, but insisted that she had never sent or received material with a classified header on her private server. \" classified material has a header which has'top secret, \" secret, \"confidential, ' \" she said, per politico. \" nothing — and i will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the department of justice, none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header, \" she added. Trump said that under obama, the us has pursued \" the dumbest foreign policy \" he has ever seen, the guardian reports. Asked about his claim that he knows more about isis than the generals, he said the generals \" have been reduced to rubble \" under obama. Trump claimed that he had always been against the 2003 invasion of iraq, but repeated that he thought the us should have taken the country's oil. Asked about his plan to defeat isis he said: \" i have a substantial chance of winning — make america great again. If i win, i don't want to broadcast to the enemy what my plan is. \" clinton, asked about her foreign policy record, said she viewed the use of force as a last resort, cnn reports. \" we are not putting ground troops into iraq ever again and we are not putting ground troops into syria, \" she said, arguing that isis could",

Nearly $ 400,000 poured in via its indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, an amount that is 3246 % of the original goal. The rest came via website orders for what lelo is calling \" the first major condom innovation in 70 years. \" the hex has been eight years in the making, with the goal being to address three key complaints users ( or non-users, in many dissatisfied cases ) have: discomfort, slippage, and breakage. One of hex's differentiators is visible: a honeycomb lattice pattern. Inspired by graphene's \" hexagonal molecular structure, \" lelo incorporated such a structure into the hex, which it says is less likely to slip or tear and \" maximize[ s ] sensitivity. \" and if it does tear, melia robinson writes for business insider that puncture is contained within the affected cell. She watched lelo founder filip sedic try and fail to break a hex with his fingernails and a pen: mashable tried to pierce one with a needle and couldn't. One writer for bustle gave the condom, which starts at $ 19.90 for a 12-pack, a go with her partner and found it easy to open; easy to tell up from down; incredibly stretchy; both super thin and strong; and pleasingly transparent. Her man called it the \" strongest \" orgasm he's ever had wearing a condom. ( hex has a celebrity spokesman. )",

The hunting derby is going ahead on forest service and private land over the next three days, but the size of the contest area was reduced by half after conservationists sued to stop it from being held on millions of acres of bureau of land management land, reports the boise weekly. The contest was organized by a group calling itself idaho for wildlife, which promises that fur buyers will be on hand. On its website, the group says it can't tell people not to hunt on blm land, but the decision means \" any predators taken on blm land during the contest period cannot be entered into the competitive hunting event to win prizes or cash, \" oregon public radio reports. The group predicts a \" good turnout \" for its \" predator hunting contest and fur rendezvous, \" which organizations including the center for biological diversity plan to keep fighting. Last year, around 100 hunters took part, killing 21 coyotes but no wolves, which were taken off the endangered list in 2011.

Tesla's model 3, which hits the streets later this month, will cost $ 35,000 — or about half the price of its previous models, the ap reports. The model 3 is expected to create hundreds of thousands of new tesla owners at a time when current owners are already complaining about long wait times for repairs. According to business insider, a former tesla employee called the repair process for his model s a \" nightmare, \" and other tesla owners have said it can take weeks to get repairs done. On tuesday, tesla announced how it will handle what the wall street journal calls the \" most critical test \" in its history: the company is hiring 1,400 repair technicians, adding 100 service centers, and deploying 350 new service vans. Currently there are only 150 or so tesla service centers and 130 repair vans worldwide. Tesla says it can diagnose 90 % of maintenance issues remotely and can fix 80 % of them without the car being brought to a service center. The new repair vans — equipped with espresso machines and snacks for the customer — will be dispatched to homes and roadsides, ideally freeing up space at service centers.",

            "Aerosmith's steven tyler has again sent president trump a cease-and-desist letter for using the band's music without permission at a political rally. In 2015, the singer's legal team warned the then-republican presidential candidate over his use of \"dream on \" on the campaign trail. Three years later, a trump rally tuesday at west virginia's charleston civic center featured aerosmith's 1993 hit \"livin ' on the edge, \" resulting in another cease-and-desist letter from tyler, variety reports. \"by using 'livin ' on the edge ' without our client's permission, mr. Trump is falsely implying that our client, once again, endorses his campaign and/or his presidency, as evidenced by actual confusion seen from the reactions of our client's fans all over social media, \" the cease-and-desist letter stated. \"this specifically violates section 43 of the lanham act, as it 'is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person. ' \" the letter also notes that trump's team has ignored the previous cease-and-desist from 2015, making this latest violation a \"willful infringement. \"what makes this violation even more egregious is that mr.

            "Aerosmith singer steven tyler is demanding president donald trump stop using the band's songs at rallies, like the one held at the charleston civic center in west virginia on tuesday ( august 21 ). The band's 1993 hit \"livin ' on the edge \" was played as trump devotees entered the venue, which has a capacity of 13,500. Tyler has in turn sent a \"cease and desist \" letter through his attorney dina lapolt to the white house accusing the president of willful infringement in broadcasting the song, which was written by tyler, joe perry and mark hudson. Citing the lanham act, which prohibits \"any false designation or misleading description or representation of fact … likely to cause confusion … as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, \" tyler's attorney contends that playing an aerosmith song in a public arena gives the false impression that tyler is endorsing trump's presidency. The matter has come up previously with another aerosmith song, \"dream on, \" which trump used during his 2015 election campaign.

        "summary": "When an earthquake struck italy in 1570, pope pius v blamed the destruction on god's supposed wrath against the jews. Less predictably, the quake also shifted the course of italy's longest river by 25 miles. The magnitude-5.8 quake struck near the northern city of ferrara in 1570, killing dozens and causing thousands more to abandon their homes, american geophysical union reports. Now, researchers analyzing extensive historical records and using new modeling techniques say the temblor was the final step in the centuries-long shift of the po river. \" the 1570 earthquake marked the definitive diversion of the final part of the po river away from ferrara, \" they write in the journal of geophysical research: solid earth. Over the past 2,800 years the po has moved north by about 12 miles between the towns of ficarlo and guastella, likely due to small shifts caused by temblors culminating in the 1570 earthquake, live science reports. That one caused the po valley to rise by 4 to 6 inches on the river's right side, creating a major shift in the river's flow and moving its delta north to its present location. Neat factoid: the 1570 quake was so destructive that it led italian architect pirro ligorio to design the world's first earthquake-resistant buildings. As for the jewish angle, pope pius v maintained that god was punishing ferrara's duke for allowing jews and marranos to take refuge there from spain.

An earthquake in 1570 changed the course of the po river in italy, new research finds. The po, the longest river in italy, has shifted northward about 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) between the towns of guastella and ficarolo over the past 2,800 years, researchers reported july 20 in the journal of geophysical research: solid earth. This shift likely happened in spurts, forced by quakes. The 1570 temblor caused a 4- to 6-inch ( 10 to 15 centimeters ) uplift of the right flank of the river and resulted in a major one-time shift of the final portion of the waterway, according to geoscientists livio sirovich and franco pettenati of the national institute for oceanography and experimental geophysics ( ogs ) in trieste. As a result of the quake, the river's delta moved 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) north, to its current position.

Now, a new study finds that the 16th century earthquake and subsequent aftershocks were the last step in a tectonic process that occurred over thousands of years and changed the course of the po river. The final rerouting of the river left ferrara dry by the end of the 16th century, an event depicted in a painting that now hangs in the vatican museum. The new research used historical data and new modeling techniques to find that the 1570 earthquake occurred on a fault buried underneath the sediments of the po river, about 14 kilometers ( 9 miles ) north-northeast of ferrara. The fault corresponds to the outermost, buried front of the northern apennine mountains that has slowly risen over millions of years, causing uplift of the southern portion of the po valley.

The scientists then talked to people before and after a nudist event, and found that the longer and more frequently people are naked, the higher they rate all these markers of happiness. One participant suggests that seeing other \" not perfect \" bodies does wonders for one's own self esteem, though researchers still need to sort out exactly why people feel happier after baring all.

One was something wonderful: rodgers and hammerstein's broadway revolution. A second was a 2006 biography of controversial director elia kazan, who ratted out eight colleagues as members of the communist party like himself, back in the 1950s. This book ( elia kazan: a biography ) is getting the most attention because kazan \" was scorned by much of liberal hollywood after his testimony, \" and weinstein is likely to see a parallel with his own situation, notes the guardian. The third book appeared to be a journal or other type of notebook. Related: the sketches: the courtroom sketches of weinstein are, um, \" really something, \" notes buzzfeed, which compares them here to photos of weinstein. Among other things, he looks much heavier in the sketches. ( they're by the same artist who got flak over her tom brady sketches. ) what's next? now that weinstein has surrendered, \" what happens next? \" that's the question posed by cbs this morning, whose anchors chatted with the new york times ' jodi kantor ( kantor, along with colleague megan twohey, first broke the weinstein story in the times in early october ). One possibility, per kantor: even more women may now come forward. Rose mcgowan's plans: accuser rose mcgowan put out a short message on twitter friday: \" we got you, harvey weinstein, we got you. \" she talked at length with the ap, noting she intends to be at his trial if there is one and that she thinks sexual predators may finally be on notice: \" this is the first time since written history that women are being believed — begrudgingly, but still. \"",

The pictures, which many experts believe are authentic, appear to show a j-20 prototype performing a high-sped taxi test, which likely means the aircraft's first flight will happen as soon as the next few weeks, the wall street journal reports. The prototype appears to have \" the potential to be a competitor with the f-22 and to be decisively superior to the f-35, \" the united states'two stealth fighters, says an expert. If the pictures are authentic, it would mean china is close to developing an f-22 rival — that jet is currently the only fully operational stealth fighter in the world. Along with other new military equipment, including its first aircraft carrier as well as \"carrier-killer \" missiles, the j-20 could give china the ability to challenge the us navy in the asia-pacific region. Us officials downplayed the photos, however, claiming there is evidence the chinese are still having development problems. American intelligence agencies reportedly place the j-20's operational date around 2018, two years earlier than robert gates predicted in 2009. Click for more details about the j-20.",

In 2005, his ex-wife accused him of beating her, and a court document lists broken ribs, dislocated shoulders, a blood clot on the brain, a twice-broken nose, and a knocked-out tooth. Ariel castro also had at least one nasty dispute with a neighbor that ended up in court.

She's no \"stranger \" to competing with injuries, \"but it's going be really hard. \" the bruise appears likely to affect vonn's performance, the washington post adds. \"when i tried my boot on, i was just standing in the hotel room barely flexing forward and it was excruciatingly painful, \" she continues in the interview. \"and i've got to try to ski downhill at 75-80 miles per hour. \" she says she's not even sure she will be able to make the first training run tomorrow. Vonn was, and perhaps still is, a medal contender in all 5 alpine events. Video of the interview is available here.",

Lindsey vonn has been hoping to be one of the stars of the vancouver olympics, gunning for five medals on the slopes at nearby whistler mountain. Now, an injury could derail the plans.

Vonn hurt her right shin during slalom training in austria, she said, and has had fluid drained from the deep bruise. She said she acknowledged the injury now because she said she wants people to know why she might not perform as well as expected in vancouver. \" i ' m sitting here today questioning whether, you know, i ' ll be even able to ski, \" vonn said at a news conference wednesday. \" i have to play it by ear. \" asked whether she could be forced to sit out altogether, vonn replied: \" yeah, that's a possibility. \" vonn is seen as a medal contender in all five alpine disciplines, and the overwhelming favorite in downhill and super-g, which she has dominated on the world cup circuit this season. After an injury-plagued turin olympics four years ago, she was coming into vancouver in top form, having won her last world cup race. \" i felt perfectly healthy, i was happy, i was coming in with confidence, and now i have another injury, \" she said. \" i fought through injuries before and i ' m no stranger to that, but it's going be really hard. I just have to try to stay positive and do the best i can, because that's all i can do. \" but vonn also acknowledged being fearful of what all this might mean for her medal quest at the vancouver winter games. She described her mind-set as \" very emotional, very scared. Not the positive way you want to be starting the olympics. \" the associated press contributed to this story."

Just 4 % of respondents said the country would be worse off if every single congressman were replaced in the 2014 elections, while 47 % said it would be better off, according to a new usa today/princeton poll. Numbers that high generally foretell \" wave \" elections in which control of the house switches; in 1994, it was 40 %, and in 2006 it was 42 %. A washington post/abc news poll, meanwhile, finds that 75 % aren't happy with how the political system is working — which is unsurprising, given that 81 % disapproved of the shutdown. Both polls show republicans taking most of the blame for the shutdown, and in the post poll 63 % had an unfavorable view of the party. But democrats didn't exactly come away smelling like roses, either; more than 60 % disapproved of their handling of the negotiations, and a record 49 % had an unfavorable view of the party.",

Ikea said that kamprad died saturday at his home in smaland, sweden. \" he will be much missed and warmly remembered by his family and ikea staff all around the world, \" the company said. Kamprad's life story is intimately linked to the company he founded at 17 on the family farm. His work ethic, frugality, and down-to-earth style remain at the core of its corporate identity. But his missteps in life, including early flirtations with nazism that the bbc notes he referred to as the \" greatest mistake \" of his life, never rubbed off on ikea. In a 1998 book, he gave more details about his youthful \" delusions, \" saying he had been influenced by his german grandmother's strong support for hitler. \" now i have told all i can, \" he said. \" can one ever get forgiveness for such stupidity? \" kamprad formed the company's name from his own initials and the first letters of the family farm, elmtaryd, and its parish of agunnaryd. It's in the heart of smaland, a forested province whose people are known for thrift and ingenuity. Kamprad possessed both. His name often appeared on lists of the world's richest men, but he drove a modest volvo and dressed unassumingly, shopping for his clothes at flea markets. Kamprad's personal wealth was established at $ 113 million, a considerable amount, but ikea officials have said that lists comparing his wealth to that of warren buffet or bill gates erroneously considered ikea's assets as his own. Ikea is owned by foundation that kamprad created, whose statutes require profits to be reinvested in the company or donated to charity. The estate inventory showed that kamprad donated more than $ 20 million in 2012 alone.",

Little had planned to retire after this season and form a jazz band for seniors, she had told 11alive in an interview before her death. As the atlanta journal-constitution pointed out in a february story about the world record, the feat is \" even more remarkable when you consider that she plays an instrument more than a foot taller than she is. \" that story quotes timothy cobb, principal bassist with the new york philharmonic, who calls it \" mind-boggling \" given the \" brute force \" required to play the instrument on the symphony level. What's more, little weighed 98 pounds, was battling cancer, and had recently fallen and cracked a vertebrae. \"it takes so much, to push those metal strings down against the fingerboard, \" she said. \" i just kept on. \"",

        "summary": "David petraeus has finally spoken to the media, telling an hln reporter that he had not passed any classified info to paula broadwell and that his resignation had nothing to do with the benghazi attack. The interview was off-camera, but reporter kyra phillips says that he \" told me he had engaged in something dishonorable. He sought to do the honorable thing in response — and that was come forward. \" he said the affair ended months ago, and that he hasn't spoken to broadwell since the scandal broke, cnn reports. Other recent developments in the scandal: before leaving the cia, petraeus had been at odds with national intelligence director james clapper, the pentagon, and other agencies, because petraeus wanted to release a detailed timeline of the benghazi attack in response to mounting criticism of the cia, the wall street journal reports. That left him with few allies in the administration when news of the affair broke. The journal also reports that petraeus ' military background made for an uncomfortable fit at the cia, with agents complaining of his more controlling style, and petraeus bristling when much younger agents raised disagreements with him. Conspiracy theories are swirling around the dismissal. Judge andrew napolitano told fox news yesterday that \" someone obviously wanted to silence general petraeus, \" adding that the broadwell affair had been rumored since well before his cia nomination, mediaite reports. Napolitano pointed out that the cia does a deep background check on new arrivals. And it turns out that if they'd checked wikipedia at the right time, they might have known what was up. For about an hour back in january, broadwell's wikipedia page contained the sentence, \" petraeus is reportedly one of her many conquests. \" an editor deleted it as \" libel/vandalism, \" the huffington post reports.",

The detroit free press has the fascinating story of what remains of one of them. Southfield, michigan's northland center opened in 1954 as the then-world's largest shopping center, reports detroit news. It grew to 1.4 million square feet over its 61 years — above ground. Then there are the tunnels. As jc reindl writes for the free press, a miles-long network of service tunnels wind their way beneath, with 484 rooms lurking there as well. They functioned as storage ( a santa claus statuette, fur coats, and tvs remain in some ), workshop areas, and bomb shelters; there was a central power station for the mall, and a police substation. The tunnels are not pretty today: reindl describes them as \" narrow, barely walkable \" and pitch black but not, as rumored, teeming with rats. And rats may not have long to find their way there. The city purchased the 114-acre property in december, and the news reports that per the terms of the $ 2.4 million sale, the site will be razed in anticipation of a sale to a property developer. The tunnels will go with it. \" we're going to have a big hole to fill with dirt, \" the executive director of the southfield downtown development authority tells reindl.",

On sunday, egypt's ministry of antiquities announced the find in the tell el-samara area, north of cairo, per cnn.

The previous record of 278 nominations in 2014 has been surpassed by the 376 — 228 people and 148 organizations — suggested this year, a phenomenon that the head of the nobel institute suggests is due to so much happening around the globe. \" we live in a world where there are a lot of conflicts and where there are also a certain number of processes that are heading in a more positive direction, \" olav njolstad says. \" clearly, this has inspired a lot of people to exercise their right to nominate someone. \" the list of nominees is supposed to remain under wraps for at least 50 years, though names are apparently fair game if the person or group who selected a nominee decides to make that recommendation public. Names already leaked this way include trump, the pope, german chancellor angela merkel, and actress susan sarandon ( the wall street journal notes edward snowden's on the list, too ). Only certain people — including members of national assemblies and governments, ex-nobel laureates, and certain academic and institutional bigwigs — are allowed to cast a nomination, and in trump's case, his name was offered by an anonymous american who selected trump for his \" peace through strength ideology, \" the director of norway's peace research institute tells the journal ( he also notes trump isn't likely to win ). The prize will be announced in october. ( one group that's been making headlines in the run for the prize: greek islanders assisting refugees. )",

Facebook condemns terrorism, the company said in a statement, but it will \" continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems. \" earlier, twitter ceo jack dorsey tweeted: \" we stand with @timcook and apple ( and thank him for his leadership )! \" in related coverage: the new york times looks at how the apple-fbi showdown was more than a year in the making — and how it was foreshadowed by a clash over a meth dealer's phone. Wired dives deep into the technical issues involved and explains why the feds may never be able to get into the phone, even if apple does everything they want it to. Reuters speaks to legal experts about the case, one of whom notes that the san bernardino case presents the \" worst set of facts possible for apple \" to have to defend its encryption policy under. The wall street journal reports on the reaction on capitol hill, where senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr was rumored to be looking at introducing criminal penalties for companies that buck court orders on encrypted communications. When the issue came up at a democratic town hall on thursday night, neither hillary clinton nor bernie sanders would pick a side, even though \" there really isn't a middle ground to occupy, \" the intercept reports.

This story was updated on march 2, 2013 at 10: 35 a.m. Et. Cape canaveral, fla. — the private spaceflight company spacex says it has restored vital thrusters on its robotic dragon space capsule in orbit, but the hours of last-minute scrambling to fix the problem mean the cargo ship must delay its arrival at the international space station. Spacex and nasa officials say a hardware glitch, which occurred after the dragon spacecraft's launch atop a falcon 9 rocket early friday ( march 1 ), prevented the spacecraft from performing vital maneuvers to put it on course for the space station. The spacecraft is hauling nearly a ton of cargo and support equipment to the space station for nasa and was expected to arrive on saturday. That delivery, however, is delayed for at least a day, and possibly longer, spacex officials said. \" it's a bit too early for timing, \" spacex's billionaire founder and ceo elon musk told reporters in a teleconference after the launch. \" we're definitely not going to rush it. \" the falcon 9 rocket launched on time at",

Dragon was then pulled in using the robotic arm and was berthed to the station at 5: 56 a.m. Est. Astronauts will begin unpacking the cargo aboard the spacecraft early this week. An anomaly with the thrusters aboard its dragon spacecraft caused spacex to miss a scheduled burn to adjust the capsule orbit on friday, causing spacex to delay by at least 24 hours saturday's planned rendezvous with the international space station. Spacex engineers have been working full-throttle to resolve the thruster issue, which followed a picture-perfect launch atop the falcon 9 rocket. Spacex founder and ceo elon musk and nasa officials said they are confident musk's engineers will resolve the problem quickly and could have dragon on track for a rendezvous sunday.

At least, that's the gist of a few articles that have made the rounds recently. A particularly popular article in men's health cited a study in the journal medicine &amp; science in sports &amp; exercise that will make any desk jockey wince. Examining the lifestyles of more than 17,000 men and women over 13 years, the report found those who sit for most of the day were 54 % more likely to die of heart attacks. According to men's health, that statistic was true even if the people in the study were nonsmokers and regular exercisers. Another report cited in a recent new york times magazine story tracked 123,000 americans and found the death rate for those who spent six or more hours a day sitting",

            "Conservative radio talk show host rush limbaugh today accused gallup of counting too many blacks in its tracking polls on president obama's approval ratings in order to keep him above the 50 percent mark while several other polls have shown him slipping below that. \" gallup has him just teetering on the little teeter-totter at 50 % and they're doing everything they can -- they're upping the sample to black americans -- to keep him up at 50 % in the gallup poll, \" limbaugh said on today's broadcast. Limbaugh did not give any details about how he arrived at his conclusion about gallup's methodology in the transcript of the show available on his website. Gallup's nov. 9-15 survey had obama's approval rating at 53 percent while 39 percent disapproved of his performance and 8 percent expressed no opinion. Limbaugh pointed to a fox news/opinion dynamics poll conducted nov. 17-18 putting the number of voters who approve or disapprove of obama at 46 percent each, with 8 percent undecided. That compared to the 50 percent who approved of his performance in late october, while 41 percent disapproved. Two other polls this week - by quinnipiac university and public policy polling - had obama just under 50 percent. Quinnipiac's put his job approval number at 48 percent and ppp had it at 49 percent."

When specific fingers were targeted, he identified which one correctly 84 % of the time, though he couldn't discern an item's texture, and new scientist notes he didn't register feeling in his thumb or fingertips, which is a barrier to getting copeland to the point where he could grip an object.

Things spiraled from there: wilson tried to call 911; guerrero says she was shoved and kicked harrison as she was falling. The women say they were roughed up, arrested, scolded in the basement of the market, and released on bail but required to stay on the island — for a period that lasted five months, until the prosecutor dropped the case, reports hawaii news now. What's more, the surveillance video from the time of the incident has gone missing, the women's attorney tells khon2. \" i just think that what he did was absolutely wrong without a doubt, \" wilson says. \" i just really want an example to be made. \" harrison, a 26-year veteran of the force, has not released a comment but remains on active duty, while the police department says it has launched an internal investigation, reports the ap.

Also remarkable: how he was spotted. The sergeant who saw him from a police chopper says, \" i just, out the corner of my eye, caught a little flash of something. It wasn't much, but it was enough to make me get the guys to turn the aircraft around. \" a police instagram video shows luke propping himself up on the ground as the first officer reaches him — the herald sun says a chainsaw had to be used to forge a path through brush to get him out — and a photo tweeted by a 10 news reporter shows his parents hugging him.

The new statesman profiles the 50-year-old translator for the european commission in brussels: he knows 32 languages, and that's just the living ones. After learning his second language, english, as a 5-year-old growing up in greece, he followed that up with german, italian, russian, and east african swahili — by age 14, reports worldcrunch. Then came the likes of arabic and bengali, plus a couple of dead languages ( like old church slavic ), and he's toying with the idea of korean or japanese next. He describes himself to the new statesman as the \" opposite of odysseus, \" in that he wants to open himself up to the world. Even among the polyglots that make up the community of more than 2,000 european commission linguists, ikonomou is unique. He speaks 21 of the 24 official eu languages ( all but estonian, maltese, and irish, per the new statesman ), while most top out at eight or fewer. Ikonomou describes himself as a nerd who considers mandarin the \" everest of languages \" ( yes, he's fluent ) and says reading egyptian hieroglyphics in cairo is close to a \" mental orgasm. \" he says he doesn't know how long it typically takes him to learn a new language: \" i don't look at my watch.

The grand total? $ 1,977.75. It's not clear how often kim might have to put out that much money — it includes products that, of course, presumably last her a while. Still, some of the findings are pretty awe-inspiring: \" my skin is more on the dry side, so i need a really thick moisturizer all the time, \" kim reveals in one section. \" i love guerlain orchidée impériale the rich cream because i love the scent and the rich creaminess. \" the cost? $ 455 for a 1.7-ounce bottle. She also recommends tracie martyn's shakti resculpting body cream, which will set you back $ 155 for a 200ml bottle, and she says natura bisse's c+c vitamin cream ( $ 115 for a 2.5-ounce bottle ) \" smells really strongly of orange, and i think it's nice every once in a while. \" but if none of the above is within your price range, at least you can likely afford her preferred cleansing towelettes, which cost just $ 1.83 for a pack of seven. Of course, none of this will do you any good if you don't share kim's taste in upkeep: \" i have so many friends who don't wear makeup and hardly ever do their hair, \" she opines. \" i feel really blessed because i genuinely love the process of getting my hair and makeup done. \" ( in more kim news, she apparently wants to be amal clooney's legal assistant. )",
