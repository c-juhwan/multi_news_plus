        "summary": "British authorities on tuesday approved plans for a contentious and long-delayed road tunnel under the site of stonehenge — but altered its route so it won't impede views of the sun during the winter solstice. The government said the 1.8-mile tunnel will bury a frequently gridlocked road, the a303, that now runs past the prehistoric monument in southwest england. The department for transport said the tunnel will \" reconnect the two halves of the 6,500 acre world heritage site which is currently split by the road, and remove the sight and sound of traffic from the stonehenge landscape. \" it said the revised route will be 150 feet further from the giant stone circle than previously proposed \" to avoid conflicting with the solstice alignment, \" reports the ap. But critics say the tunnel — first proposed nearly 30 years ago — will disturb a rich archaeological site. University of buckingham archaeologist david jacques says \" the stonehenge landscape is unutterably precious and you tamper with it at your peril. \" stonehenge, built between 3000 bc and 1600 bc for reasons that remain mysterious, is one of britain's most popular tourist attractions, receiving more than 1 million visitors annually. It's also a spiritual home for thousands of druids and mystics who visit at the summer and winter solstices. The guardian reports the project has ballooned to an estimated $ 2.12 billion; construction would stretch over five years and could possibly begin in 2021. ( here's one way stonehenge could have been constructed. )",

        "summary": "If you've finally mastered \" omg \" and \" iykwim, \" you may be ready for the next step in deciphering text messages — though if you're the parent of a teen, you might not like what you uncover. That's because teens are spending more time sexting, with at least 25 % receiving sexually charged texts and emails, and at least 1 in 7 blasting them out. A meta-analysis of 39 studies by the university of calgary and alberta children's hospital research institute, published in jama pediatrics, looked at sexting habits of more than 110,000 kids ages 12 to 17. The study found \" sexting is becoming a more common practice among youth, \" but that instead of freaking out, parents should incorporate it into the sex education their children receive. \" today's teens often do not separate their online and offline lives, \" study lead author sheri madigan tells the cbc. \" this is hard for parents to grasp. \" the study explains why sexting among teens isn't necessarily a bad thing. Its authors say it can serve as a safe way for teens to first approach the issues of sexuality and intimacy, as long as both parties are equally into it and no one feels forced. If there is coercion, however, or if sexts leaks out to other parties — more than 10 % of teens say they've passed along sexts without getting permission from co-sexters — those who feel betrayed can experience mental health issues similar to those found after cyberbullying. Another surprising find from the study, per the los angeles times: girls are as likely as boys to take part in sexting. What parents should do, according to the study's authors: offer \" age-specific information on sexting and its potential consequences \" as a regular part of their children's sex ed.

        "summary": "\" loosen, \" \" ease \" and \" relax \": those are the verbs being used to describe what's happening to china's one-child policy. According to the official xinhua news agency, as long as one parent in a couple is an only child, that couple will now be allowed to have two children, the wall street journal reports. The current policy allows couples in some cities to have a second child if both parents are only children, and lets rural families have two kids if the first is a girl, explains the bbc. That 30-year-old policy has come under fire recently, businessweek reports, as critics say it has led to an aging population and decreasing workforce ( which do no favors to china economically ), and an uneven gender ratio — not to mention citizens just don't like it. Earlier this week, an official promised the government would \" fine-tune \" the policy, but warned that the country needed to maintain a \" low birth rate. \" the current policy has led to an average of 1.6 children per family — 2.1 children per family generally accepted as the figure needed to maintain a steady population, explains businessweek. Another change announced today: china will end a controversial \" re-education through labor \" policy that allowed people to be detained in labor camps for up to four years without a trial.",

        "summary": "An officer involved in the infamous freddie gray arrest — which sparked rioting and political upheaval in baltimore after gray died a week later — conceded that the man appeared to need medical help while in police custody, the baltimore sun reports. According to officer william porter, gray asked for help while cuffed in the back of a police van on april 12. \" help me, \" gray reportedly said. \" help me up. \" porter asked whether gray needed \" a medic or something, \" and gray indicated yes, so porter says he told the van's driver, officer caesar goodson, jr., and sgt. Alicia white, though he wasn't sure whether gray was faking to avoid jail time. White checked on gray herself, porter says, and ordered the other officers to get the man some medical help. But they stopped to drop off another detainee at the station, where gray was found unresponsive and taken to a hospital; there, doctors found him in cardiac arrest, perhaps with a nearly severed spine. Police provided the sun with statements by porter and the other officers, which sometimes contradict each other, triggering an angry response from an attorney speaking for all of the accused officers: the statements are \" being disclosed at a time and in a manner which is both unfair and unconstitutional, \" he says. \" we look forward to the opportunity for a complete and thorough review of all of the evidence and information that will be presented at trial. \" all of the officers have pleaded not guilty to charges including second-degree murder and manslaughter. The first of their separate trials is scheduled to start oct. 13, the ap reports.",

Those statements — which have never been publicly revealed — help to explain why a judge has ordered separate trials for six officers charged in the incident. Some of the statements provide differing accounts of events that day; defense attorneys have argued in court that such conflicts could create problems in a joint trial. Officer william porter told police investigators that after being summoned to check on gray on the morning of april 12, he told the van's driver that the city booking facility would not process gray because he was in medical distress. \" help me. Help me up, \" gray said. Porter helped gray up and asked, \" do you need a medic or something? do you need to go to the hospital? \" when gray responded affirmatively, porter said he told the van's driver, officer caesar goodson, jr., that central booking wouldn't accept gray. Porter also told investigators he wasn't sure if gray was in distress, or trying to convince officers to take him to the hospital instead of jail. That sequence of events was drawn from a police account of porter's statement, provided as part of an initial police review of gray's fatal injury in police custody; goodson was the only officer charged in gray's arrest and transport who did not provide a statement to investigators.

While mcmaster and trump butted heads both publicly and privately during his tenure at the white house, officials say mcmaster's resignation is amicable and has been in the works for weeks. Officials say trump wanted to finish a shakeup of his national security team before a planned meeting with north korea's kim jong-un.

The incoming national security adviser has said the us should declare war on both north korea and iran. Bolton, notably, has also been a longtime contributor on fox news. In the past, he's been accused of abusing his subordinates and manipulating us intelligence ahead of the iraq war and has connections to anti-muslim groups. His appointment to national security adviser was met with concern from some areas. \"i operate on the assumption that john bolton should be kept as far away from the levers of foreign policy as possible, \" says the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian cato institute.",

        "summary": "A criminal trial underway in germany is straightforward enough: a woman named beate zschaepe is accused of helping two neo-nazi male friends pull off a string of immigrant murders over several years beginning in 2000. The two men are dead and the 41-year-old zschaepe, who faces life in prison, says she played no role in the killings. After 2.5 years of no comment, she apologized in a statement read in court last week, per the telegraph. \" i feel morally guilty that i could not prevent 10 murders and two bombings. \" the case is about far more than zschaepe, however, reports the guardian, which explores how the trial raises troubling questions about germany's ability, or even desire, to crack down on neo-nazi groups. It's not just that investigators bungled the investigation, wrongly thinking for years the murders were linked to the turkish mafia. It's that investigators have shown no interest in looking beyond zschaepe into the network of extremist groups that appeared to have aided the spree. The story suggests that germany's domestic intelligence agency, the bfv, essentially has turned a blind eye to such groups, leaving \" a thriving underground culture of rightwing extremism untouched. \" one hard-to-explain nugget: at one of the murders, an undercover bfv agent was actually in the cafe at the time but failed to report his presence.

Per the wall street journal, the court decided tuesday to retain smith's conviction of attempted first-degree robbery instead of reducing the charge, even though it was smith's hand, not a firearm, under his hoodie when he told a teller at a queens check-cashing store he had a gun and demanded money. The court says that, based on an interpretation of new york's penal law regarding robbery, the teller reasonably could have thought smith really had a gun, warranting the higher charge. To bolster its decision for this 2011 case, the court cited a previous 1989 case it had ruled on in which it said the ball was in the defendant's court to prove there was no gun, the new york law journal reports.",

First introduced in a paper last month published in the acm transactions on computer-human interaction journal, the waitsuite language software developed in mit's computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory detects when you're idling during five distinct tasks — the elevator and text message scenarios, as well as while uploading content to your phone, searching for a wifi connection, and sending or receiving emails — and then shows you new vocabulary words in a language you're trying to learn. Because the technology sends the words directly onto the screen you're currently viewing, rather than being a discrete feature to open separately, you're able to learn \" without leaving what you were already doing, \" project lead carrie cai says in a release. The apps can tell when users have wait time via sensors that show when their devices are looking for a wifi signal or have detected the bluetooth signals used near elevators, for example. With the package's \" waitchatter \" instant messaging app, users picked up an average of four new words a day, or nearly 60 words over a two-week period. Cai, who notes users stay focused on their original tasks because they're not leaving their screens, says the apps can also be used to learn math or technical jargon.

        "summary": "\"we've always joked about this, but holy crap, this man actually did it, \" florida physician gregory holt tells the atlantic. Holt and a team of emergency room doctors were preparing to treat a 70-year-old man who was brought into miami's jackson memorial hospital unconscious, with septic shock, difficulty breathing, and a high amount of alcohol in his system when they discovered a tattoo reading \" do not resuscitate \" on his chest. The \" not \" was underlined, and the man's signature was tattooed below. What happened next was documented in a case study published thursday in the new england journal of medicine. The study states the tattoo \" produced more confusion than clarity \" and \" might represent permanent reminders of regretted decisions made while the person was intoxicated. \" initially, holt and the doctors ignored the tattoo. \" you pick the choice that's not irreversible, \" holt explains. But an ethics consultant advised the doctors to heed the tattoo. \" someone does not go to the trouble of getting such a tattoo without forethought and mindfulness, \" the university of miami's ken goodman says. But that's exactly what happened in a 2012 case study, the washington post reports. A 59-year-old man had \" d.n.r. \" tattooed on his chest but was fortunately conscious to explain to doctors that it was only there because he \" lost a bet playing poker. \" holt and the other doctors were eventually bailed out when case workers located an official dnr request for the patient, who died the following day. Holt says the whole situation shows him \" we need a better system. \"",

Was it an accurate representation of what the patient wanted? was it legally sound? should they honor it? the case was detailed thursday in the new england journal of medicine, in a report that laid out the medical team's struggle for answers. \"this patient's tattooed dnr request produced more confusion than clarity, given concerns about its legality and likely unfounded beliefs that tattoos might represent permanent reminders of regretted decisions made while the person was intoxicated, \" the paper's authors wrote.

Anti-doping agency was dismissed hours after it had been filed monday, with the judge resoundingly chastising his legal team for failing to properly write the complaint. In a tersely worded three-page response to armstrong's 80-page brief and request for a temporary restraining order against usada, which in june accused the seven-time tour de france champion of engaging in a massive sports doping conspiracy, u.s. District court judge sam sparks gave armstrong's legal team 20 days to refile the complaint. The judge, raising the threat of sanctions if future pleadings did not meet the required format, advised armstrong's attorneys to \"omit any improper argument, rhetoric, or irrelevant material \" from the amended brief. Armstrong's austin-based attorney, tim herman, said early monday night the lawsuit would be refiled by wednesday at the latest. \"we will refile in a format that conforms to what judge sparks wants, \" herman said in a phone interview. \"obviously, i would have preferred not to have the order — i'd be lying if i said otherwise — but judge sparks is very straightforward, to say the least. When he speaks, i listen. \" in the complaint filed in u.s. District court in the western district of texas before 10 a.m. Monday, armstrong alleged that usada and chief executive travis tygart had engaged in an obsessive, unlawful and meritless campaign to strip him of his tour titles and ruin his legacy. But sparks dismissed the complaint within about six hours, noting that federal rule of civil procedure requires a short and plain statement of the basis for the court's jurisdiction and the plaintiff's legal claim for relief. \"armstrong's complaint is far from short, spanning eighty pages and containing 261 numbered paragraphs, many of which have multiple subparts, \" sparks wrote. \"worse, the bulk of the paragraphs contain �?allegations'that are wholly irrelevant"

It all started when a man hooked a device called the knee defender to the seat in front of him, thereby preventing the woman in front of him from reclining her seat. The device, which is marketed as helping fliers prevent injury, is banned on united, and a flight attendant asked him to remove it, but he refused. That's when the woman in front of him stood up and threw a cup of water in his face, reports the ap. The flight, which was on its way to denver from newark, nj, was diverted to chicago's o ' hare, where police escorted the dueling duo, both 48, off the plane and let the rest of the passengers get on with their day. ( they arrived in denver almost two hours late. ) the police decided it was a \" customer service issue, \" and no arrests were made. Both passengers had been seated in economy plus, where they have four more inches of legroom than the rest of coach seating.

French media are reporting that the paris attackers may have taken captagon, a synthetic drug that suppresses hunger and reduces the need for sleep. Also known as the \" jihadist's drug, \" it's a favorite of isis fighters, reports abc australia. Police say syringes, needles, and plastic tubing were found in a hotel room rented by salah abdeslam, while survivors describe the terrorists as serene and composed. \" they were like zombies, \" says one. \" it's as if they were drugged. \" captagon's active ingredient, fenethylline, breaks down into theophylline — similar to caffeine — and amphetamine, which boosts pleasure and alertness and reduces a person's need for sleep and food. But experts tell live science the drug isn't as potent as adderall. Captagon was originally developed in the 1960s to treat hyperactivity and depression, but it was found to be addictive and later banned in many countries. It's now almost exclusive to the middle east. Since the start of the civil war in syria, where a pill sells for $ 5 to $ 20, production has been on the rise, with both sides accusing their enemies of taking captagon. A drug control officer told reuters last year that fighters appeared to be using the drug. \" we would beat them, and they wouldn't feel the pain. Many of them would laugh, \" he says. An expert tells live science that captagon is \" not a magical painkiller, \" though. Rather, \" when you're hyperstimulated and very focused, you tend not to react to pain as much. \" the tunisian attacker who killed 38 people in june is suspected of taking captagon, reports abc.

Supplies for that hobby you never really got into: we keep these as a form of guilt, says francine jay, author of the miss minimalist blog, but failing to get rid of them if you're not going to use them just creates a vicious \" cycle of guilt and anxiety. \" broken items: you plan to fix them someday, but someday never comes.

            "Charlottesville, va. ( ap ) — a federal jury found rolling stone magazine, its publisher and a reporter defamed a university of virginia administrator in a discredited story about gang rape at a fraternity house, news media reported friday word of the jury decision came friday afternoon in multiple news outlets. University of virginia administrator nicole eramo claimed the 2014 article portrayed her as a villain who discouraged the woman identified only as jackie from reporting the incident to police. A police investigation found no evidence to back up jackie's claims. Rolling stone's attorneys said there was no evidence that the reporter knew what she was writing about eramo was false or had serious doubts about whether it was true. Jurors heard closing arguments on tuesday after listening to more than two weeks ' worth of evidence. The story about jackie's rape set off a firestorm at the university and in schools nationwide. Eramo received hundreds of angry letters and emails calling her the \" dean of rape, \" among other things, and faced protesters outside her office. The story crumbled after other news outlets began asking questions and police found no evidence to back it up. The article was officially retracted in april 2015. Over the course of the more than two-week trial, the jury of eight women and two men watched 11 hours of video testimony, heard",
            "Rolling stone contributing editor sabrina rubin erdely, left, and rolling stone magazine deputy managing editor sean woods, right, walk with their legal team to federal court in charlottesville on tuesday. ( steve helber/ap ) a federal court jury decided friday that a rolling stone journalist defamed a former university of virginia associate dean in a 2014 magazine article about sexual assault on campus that included a debunked account of a fraternity gang rape. The 10-member jury concluded that the rolling stone reporter, sabrina rubin erdely, was responsible for defamation, with actual malice, in the case brought by nicole eramo, a u-va. Administrator who oversaw sexual violence cases at the time of the article's publication. The jury also found the magazine and its parent company, wenner media, responsible for defaming eramo, who has said her life's work helping sexual assault victims was devastated as a result of rolling stone's article and its aftermath. The lawsuit centered on erdely's 9,000-word article titled \"a rape on campus, \" which appeared online in late november 2014 and on newsstands in the magazine's december 2014 issue. Opening with a graphic depiction of a fraternity gang rape, the story caused an immediate sensation at a time of heightened awareness of campus sexual assault, going viral online and reverberating through the u-va. Community. But within days"

        "summary": "Antonin scalia's death — how it was handled, who made what decisions, and why — is appearing murkier than recent articles suggest. A former top homicide official even says \" there is something fishy going on \" with the supreme court justice's demise. To sum up: presidio county judge cinderela guevara, who pronounced scalia's death a likely heart attack, now says she only meant his heart stopped when he died, the washington post reports. \" it wasn't a heart attack, \" guevara says. \" he died of natural causes. \" she had declared scalia's death \" natural \" without seeing his body ( apparently legal in texas ) or demanding an autopsy. She had talked to a us marshal at the scene and scalia's doctor before deciding. She tells the ap that scalia's doctor — rear adm. Brian p. Monahan, who is attending physician for the supreme court and congress — said scalia had a history of high blood pressure and heart trouble, and wasn't strong enough to have shoulder surgery for a recent injury. If that's true, scalia hid it well: john poindexter, who owns the cibolo creek ranch where scalia was visiting when he died, says the supreme court justice behaved normally friday and joined a quail hunt as an observer, the new york times reports. \" he seemed in good spirits, \" poindexter tells the la times. Scalia was also traveling without a security detail of us marshals. West texas authorities spent hours seeking a justice of the peace to pronounce on scalia's death. Juanita bishop, a justice of the peace in presidio, tex., didn't get there in time but suggests she would have wanted an autopsy. \" if it had been me... I would want to know, \" she says. A former head of criminal investigations for dc police agrees, the dallas morning news reports. \" as a former homicide commander, i am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for justice scalia, \" writes william ritchie in a facebook post. \" you have a non-homicide trained us marshal tell the justice of peace that no foul play was observed.... How can the marshal say, without a thorough post mortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack … \" poindexter found scalia's body in a peaceful position saturday after checking on the apparent late sleeper: \" it was just like he was taking a nap, \" poindexter days. \" he just went to sleep and didn't wake up. \" reporters weren't",

It wasn't too hard to find the ambergris, which is both rare and valuable; they just followed their noses. \" it's a very distinctive smell, like a cross between squid and farmyard manure, \" gary says. Ambergris is used in perfume-making to extend the lifespan of scents, and smithsonian notes the not-so-delectable sounding item was once eaten: casanova was said to view it as an aphrodisiac and incorporate it into his chocolate mousse. Gary and angela had previously read about ambergris, so they knew the 3.5-pound lump shouldn't be ignored. It could get them more than $ 70,000, according to the guardian ( though atlas obscura says the going rate is more like $ 10,000 per pound ), which the couple would use to purchase a mobile home. They're currently talking with potential buyers in france and new zealand. Ambergris, which feels like a hard ball of sticky wax after hardening on a beach, is made in the intestines of whales, possibly to protect them from sharp objects they're unable to digest, like squid beaks.

Shortly before midnight, he made his thoughts known on what he thought of the lebron-lemon conversation. \" lebron james was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, don lemon, \" trump tweeted. \" he made lebron look smart, which isn't easy to do. I like mike! \" cnn notes the final sentence was likely a reference to michael jordan. Nbc news outlines some of the lebron-lemon discussion that may have ticked the president off, including james asserting that he thinks trump uses sports to create divisive rifts. When lemon asked james what he would say to trump if he ever had the chance to sit across from him, james replied, \" i would never sit across from him. \" james also called the president a \" bum \" last september after trump pulled an invitation to the golden state warriors to visit the white house. The hill notes that trump has repeatedly targeted black athletes, as well as other prominent african-americans like maxine waters, a point that didn't escape one well-known newscaster who railed against the president's latest tweet. \" this is apparently what the president of the united states feels the need to share with the world at what should be long past his bedtime? \" rather tweeted. \" it's a disgrace.

Marie laguerre was walking home on july 24 when, she says, a man passed her on the sidewalk in front of a café and made lewd noises and comments. Her response: \" ta gueule! \" ( shut up ). They kept walking in different directions. But the man picked up an ashtray from a table and threw it at laguerre, who yelled at him. \" i felt hatred. I refused to be demeaned, \" she told le parisien, per the guardian. Then the man walked back to laguerre, hit her in the face, and walked away. Since the attack, laguerre says she has suffered headaches and neck pain. The video went viral after laguerre got it from the café owner and posted it online. So-called \" street harassment \" is an ongoing issue in france; in a 2015 survey, 100 % of female commuters polled said they had been sexually harassed. Regarding the attack on laguerre, french equalities minister marlène schiappa said she was outraged, but not surprised. Schiappa was the driving force behind new legislation that will impose fines of $ 105 to $ 878 for annoying, following, and threatening women. She tells the bbc that authorities should start handing out fines this fall. As for laguerre, \" i am sick of feeling unsafe walking the street.

On the other hand, this same drug, a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety and insomnia in human adults, apparently helps them live longer, reports nature world news, citing a study published in the journal environmental research letters. This news may be, from a longevity standpoint, terrific for the tainted fish — but it's not ideal for keeping the entire ecosystem's mortality rates balanced and the food chain intact. Swedish researchers gathered eggs from a population of lake perch and exposed them to varying levels of oxazepam as the embryos grew, notes phys.org. When the fish finally hatched, scientists found that perch subjected to higher doses of the benzo had lower mortality rates than ones that received lower concentrations or none at all. The team says these results could simply be scratching the surface in exposing how pollutants affect marine creatures. \" even though our study focused on one single pharmaceutical contaminant, it is possible that similar effects could be induced by exposure to a whole range of pharmaceuticals that find their way into surface waters, such as antibiotics, painkillers, anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones, and antidepressants. \"",

The ftc accused brittain of running a \" takedown \" service — charging people hundreds of dollars to have their images removed from the website — and that gives consumerist an idea: \" perhaps each of the sites on brittain's dmca list should take a lesson from him and offer to remove his images — for an extortionate fee. \" ( brittain is not the same \" revenge porn pioneer \" recently sentenced to prison. )",

        "summary": "Next month, a spanish court will hear arguments in a most unusual case: a woman who claims to own the sun has sued ebay for blocking her extraterrestrial real estate sales. Though it sounds a little nuts, a court in madrid has ruled that 54-year-old maria angeles duran has the right to have her case heard, reports the international business times. The court won't rule on the larger issue of whether duran's claim of ownership is legit, but on the narrower one of whether she violated ebay's seller agreement. She had been selling parcels of about 11 square feet for about $ 1 each and had racked up 600 orders before ebay shut her down. Because nothing tangible was sold, it feared a scam. Duran says she was never able to collect her money and is suing for about $ 11,000 in damages, reports the consumerist. \"i am not a stupid person and i know the law, \" duran has said of her solar real estate gambit. She's basing her claim on a loophole in the un's outer space treaty that says no nation can stake ownership to a heavenly body but makes no mention of individuals — borrowing the strategy used by this entrepreneur's claim on the moon. Duran, as you might imagine, is an eclectic character, observes the washington post. \" she's studied nursing and law, dreamt up her own religion, and penned a kinky romance novel, \" writes caitlin dewey. The story notes that duran is framing her sun fight as a statement against the corporate world and promises that any profits will go to charity. For those who want in, duran is still selling parcels on her own website. ( or check out ebay's haunted dolls. )",

But maria angeles duran, a 54-year-old mother of four from vigo, spain, may be the most audacious seller on ebay: she tried to sell pieces of solar real estate. Now, duran's claims have made their way to a spanish court — a totally bizarre and unexpected twist to a bizarre, unexpected story that began five years ago.

His claim, which rested on an alleged loophole in the united nation's outer space treaty, was closely echoed by duran in legal documents she drew up for a local notary. \"outer space … is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, \" the treaty says. Nothing about individual ownership! duran said. A page from duran's notarized claim to the sun. ( via yorokobu ) interestingly, duran held onto this claim for several years without anyone really questioning it; perhaps that's because it's legally ridiculous, or because the international media never heard about it. But in 2013, duran decided to rock the boat. She opened an ebay store and began auctioning, for one euro each, square-meter plots of sun with accompanying ownership documents. You can still see the certificates, in fact: duran now sells them on her personal web site. That's because ebay found her in violation of its \"intangible goods \" policy — you can't sell things that don't exist, basically — and summarily kicked her off the site.

His team scanned 15 mathematicians ' brains as the subjects were shown 60 equations. Mathematicians were tasked with rating the equations ' beauty or ugliness. Those seen as beautiful were linked to activity in the medial orbito-frontal cortex, medical daily reports — part of the brain believed to deal with emotion. \" neuroscience can't tell you what beauty is, but if you find it beautiful the medial orbito-frontal cortex is likely to be involved, \" the researcher explains. Looking at a beautiful equation can activate it, he says, \" like looking at a great painting or listening to a piece of music. \" and you don't have to be a mathematician to see the beauty of mathematics, says a professor. Schools, he notes, don't focus on that aspect of math, but elementary school-level skills are enough to appreciate it.

        "summary": "Truth may be stranger than fiction, and for salvador dali, death is proving just as surreal as life. The famous spanish painter, who has been in eternal repose since 1989, will be exhumed under a madrid judge's orders so his dna can be tested in a paternity suit, the bbc reports. The sexagenarian behind the complaint, maria pilar abel martinez, claims the artist had an affair with her mother, a maid, in the mid-1950s. Per the efe spanish news agency, via heavy.com, the judge said exhuming dali's remains was \" necessary \" as there are \" no biological remains or personal objects \" left from which dna samples could be taken. Abel, who was born in 1956, first filed the suit in early 2015, the guardian reported at the time. Abel claimed in court docs that her mother, identified by a 2015 new york times article as antonia martinez de haro, and the surrealist painter \" had a friendship that developed into clandestine love, \" despite the fact that at the time of the alleged affair he'd been involved for decades with gala ( aka elena ivanovna diakonova ), the woman who became his wife in 1958. Abel has reportedly taken at least two other dna tests, one in 2007 that was inconclusive and one shortly after in paris, the results of which she said she never received ( the son of a close friend of dali's claims that test came up negative ). What's at stake if abel, a tarot card reader, is proven correct in her paternity claim: a possible recouping of hundreds of millions of dollars from paintings the artist bestowed on spain when he died.

The tennessean reports that the 61-year-old's last words after he was strapped into the electric chair were initially inaudible. After the warden asked him to repeat himself, he said: \" beats being on death row. \" miller was sentenced to die for the horrifically brutal 1981 murder of 23-year-old lee standifer, a mentally disabled woman he was on a first date with in knoxville, fox reports. Prosecutors said he beat and stabbed the young woman to death with a fire poker, driving it in so deep that officials said he must have used a hammer. There was no sign of breathing after the first jolt of electricity. He was pronounced dead after a second jolt. \" justice, long delayed, has now been served, \" lt. Gov. Randy mcnally said in a statement. \" it is my solemn hope the family of lee standifer can now be at peace. \" miller, the third tennessee inmate to be executed by electric chair since 1960, chose the chair over lethal injection, as tennessee inmates who committed their crimes before 1999 are permitted to do, the ap reports. Edmund zagorski was executed in the chair last month. Miller had sought to be executed by firing squad, but his appeal on the grounds that both the electric chair and lethal injection are unconstitutional was rejected by the us supreme court. ( before zagorski's execution, the electric chair's maker warned it could malfunction. )",

After more than a week of digging into the supposed founder of the student loan report, the chronicle noticed cloud's name had been scrubbed from the \" independent, authoritative news outlet \" known for unconventional surveys of indebted students. Shortly after, a statement revealed cloud was one of several pen names used by the website's editors to \" share experiences and information related to the challenges college students face while funding their education. \" as surprising as that was, it was actually just the tip of the iceberg, per npr. The statement went on to explain that student-loan refinancing company lendedu was behind the slr site and cloud, who was known to tell students to refinance their loans, per the chronicle. Its website claims founders started lendedu \" to offer transparency in the student loan market, \" and ceo nate matherson says he regrets deceiving people in regard to cloud, who was given a detailed backstory — it mentioned \" a knack for reporting throughout high school and college \" — and whose purported photo actually showed one of the founders ' college friends, per the chronicle. Still, matherson maintains all data published on the student loan report \" was vetted, accurate, and licensed from the related polling companies. \" that includes surveys claiming 62 % of people would star in a pornographic film to erase student debt, despite vague methodology.",

The company, which last month expanded into 43 latin american and caribbean countries, has been in turmoil since it announced a price hike this summer.

A researcher discovered that the late parents of famed nazi-hunter simon wiesenthal were baptized in mormon ceremonies in utah and arizona last month. \" can you believe it? \" a stunned wiesel asked on msnbc yesterday. Wiesel was also placed on the mormon to-be-baptized list. \" how come he hasn't spoken up? \" asked wiesel. \" the moment he heard about this he should have spoken up because he's running for the presidency of the united states. This is too serious an issue for him not to have spoken up. \" in an earlier interview with the huffington post, wiesel said romney should encourage his church to end the practice. \" i think it's not only objectionable, it's scandalous, \" he said. The mormons believe people can be baptized after death, and baptized hundreds of thousands of holocaust victims until they agreed to stop the practice in 1995. They have also baptized anne frank, josef stalin, and adolph hitler, notes msnbc. Romney is refusing to discuss the issue and his campaign is referring all questions to the mormon church. A mormon spokesman apologized for the baptisms of wiesenthal's parents, and promised wiesel that he and his family members won't be baptized. How do you stay off the mormons'to-be-baptized list? you can't really, says slate. Technically, mormons are only supposed to baptize ancestors, but obviously that has been loosely interpreted.

A study finds that genetically, our house cats aren't very different from their wild cousins, despite thousands of years of domestication, time reports. \" we believe we have created the first preliminary evidence that depicts domestic cats as not that far removed from wildcat populations, \" the study's senior author tells the los angeles times, which calls house cats \" only semi-domesticated. \" researchers compared the genomes of domestic cats with wildcats, the guardian reports; the results showed how the \" domestic \" animals have kept their excellent hearing and vision, among other abilities. A recent study suggests cats and humans have lived side-by-side for some 5,700 years, though the times puts the figure closer to 9,000. Living with the animals doesn't, however, mean we made them our own; in fact, it's only in the past two centuries that humans have exerted a strong influence on their breeding. What's more, some domestic cats continue to mate with wildcats. Humans have, however, affected cats ' looks, helping to drive selection for appealing colors. We've also made them at least somewhat more docile, the researchers say — thanks, in part, to stroking them. People may have been more likely to breed cats who were into petting and getting treats, the guardian reports. ( but that doesn't mean we should treat them as if they were dogs. )",

The dallas morning news reports the complaint filed by bridget alex on monday in dallas county's 101st civil district court is asking for unspecified money for damages and other costs. Alex says her 6-month-old son, brandon, fell off a bed march 11 while under the babysitter's care and seemed to be seriously hurt. The sitter used her metropcs phone ( metropcs is a wireless service owned by t-mobile ) to call 911 three times, waiting on hold 40 minutes in all, the suit says, including the final call during which she waited for more than 30 minutes. Alex sped back from a funeral she was at, as the babysitter was without a car, and rushed her son to the hospital, but it was too late: brandon died within the hour, cbs dallas reports. Alex's suit not only alleges negligence on t-mobile's part for not remedying a glitch that reportedly creates phantom 911 calls that then hang up — keeping operators from real callers as they try to call back the ghost callers — but also for not coding its phones to send gps coordinates to 911 dispatchers in case of hang-ups. On the night brandon died, there were 422 callers on hold at one point, the city of dallas reports.

        "summary": "A little over a month after new york gov. Andrew cuomo declared a state of emergency for the new york city subway, his longtime nemesis in the city, mayor bill de blasio, is proposing a new tax on wealthy new yorkers to help fix the ailing system. On monday, de blasio will announce what the new york times refers to as a \" millionaires tax \" to help repair the deteriorating system, which is plagued by delays, mechanical issues, and even derailments, the ap reports. The tax would also subsidize reduced fares for low-income riders. The tax would bump the top income rate from 3.9 % to 4.4 % for couples who make more than $ 1 million per year and individuals who make more than $ 500,000. It would affect just under 1 % of people filing taxes in the city. The new tax proposal could be a hard sell for de blasio, the times notes. Cuomo and de blasio are both under immense pressure to fix the city's aging system, and the two men, who have had an acrimonious relationship since de blasio took office in 2013, have fought over financing the subway system. The metropolitan transit authority is run by the state, not the city. Since the tax would require approval from the new york state legislature, de blasio would likely need cuomo's help to gain approval from the republican-controlled senate. In may the new york times reported that delays in the subway system had risen to 70,000 per month from about 28,000 in 2012.",

            "The brand heinz may be synonymous with ketchup for most of the world, but no longer in israel, the health ministry recently ruled. Heinz will no longer be allowed to label its red sauce as \" ketchup \" in hebrew in israel after local food manufacturer osem successfully argued that its competitor's product doesn't meet the definition of israel's tandards institute, israeli news site ynet reported. Heinz's product must be called \" tomato seasoning \" instead. The ruling does not affect english labeling. Osem petitioned against its competitor, arguing that the heinz ketchup does not contain enough tomato paste to be considered ketchup under israeli regulations. Heinz's local importer, diplomat, is filing its own petition to have the local definition of ketchup changed. Diplomat has the backing of the health ministry's food division, ynet reported. The health ministry is backing diplomat and is now seeking to change the standard from 10 % tomato solids to 6 %. The histadrut labor federation's consumer protection authority objects to diplomat's petition. Why? it's all about the children, a representative told ynet - the histadrut wants to make sure that children are eating as much tomato as possible in their ketchup.",

Israel's health ministry recently ruled that the heinz brand product does not contain enough \"tomato solids \" to be labeled as ketchup in israeli stores. It will now be relegated to the title \"tomato seasoning, \" ynet reported. The ruling was the result of a lobbying campaign by israeli food manufacturer osem, which produces a large portion of the ketchup consumed in israel.

But at 55, he's a very different man, dnainfo reports. \" if i would have understood then what i know now at my age, man, that would have never happened, \" tillman says. He worked alongside \" freeway \" rick ross, the la drug kingpin who built a nationwide drug enterprise that sold more than half a million nuggets of the drug daily, the los angeles times reported in 1995; in a look at ross last year, esquire noted that it's estimated he bought and resold three tons of cocaine over a seven-year period in the ' 80s. In chicago alone, the then-20-something tillman was taking in $ 9 million a month from the gangs he sold to, which was nearly all of them. \" i had more money than the pope, \" tillman says, and purchased more homes in which to cook cocaine into crack than he could keep straight. But he had a total change of heart when his brother was killed in 1990. \" i saw his body, and that's when i quit selling cocaine. \" now, traveling through chicago, he reflects on his actions: \" people literally smoked up everything — first their jobs, then their assets, then their retirement, and then their lives — in a cocaine pipe. My whole family is gone, \" he notes. \" man, i am real remorseful about that. \" in recent years, he's worked to help those in need of drug treatment, and today, he runs the freeway boys foundation, which is focused on helping released inmates get their lives back on track. The group's chairman, per its website, is ross, who was released from prison in 2009; dnainfo notes tillman never served time for his dealing.",

The 54-year-old contractor has been on the road for the past 29 months — he took leave of his virginia beach home in june 2014 — and he's covered more than 11,500 miles, all in the name of attracting funds for his plan to erect \" hope centers \" ( i.e., homeless shelters ) across the country, the virginian-pilot reports. Bailey, who says he'd been homeless himself while in his 20s in buffalo, ny, per the servants of god ministries website, relived that experience during his trek, on which he was constantly stopped by cops apparently suspicious of his backpack and even turned away by churches. \" if you look homeless, they don't want you there, \" he says. And so he often resorted to napping under bridges or sprawled on picnic tables, jars of peanut butter his only reliable food source ( his church contributed money toward other meals ). He also had to deal with illness — he was hospitalized in maine for pneumonia — walking-induced injuries like blisters and shin splints, and missing and stolen belongings. His long haul stretched way past the original 18 months bailey had allotted for his journey ( he ended up plowing through 10 pairs of shoes ), and he only raised about $ 10,000 out of his $ 400,000 goal, per his gofundme page. But he says that's enough to at least start a shelter in virginia beach, and he also reaped another unexpected benefit: contact with his son, whom he'd been searching for for years ( the son now lives in new york ) and whose wife saw bailey's story circulating on social media. \" it's amazing after all these years he was just a hop, skip, and a jump away, \" bailey's wife, luci, tells the pilot.

Jesse matthew, who's been charged with abduction with intent to defile in the graham case, was indicted by a grand jury today on three counts in a 2005 rape: sexual penetration with an object, abduction, and capital murder. Authorities had already said that forensic evidence indicated matthew's involvement in a third case, of virginia tech student morgan harrington, who was last seen hitchhiking outside charlottesville after a metallica concert in 2009, cnn reports. Harrington turned up dead on a farm in january 2010. Meanwhile, remains discovered in central virginia this weekend haven't yet been identified as graham's. The chief medical examiner's office in richmond will likely take its time to make sure they get it right, a forensic psychologist tells wtvr. A sheriff's search team found scattered bones, a skull, and a pair of black pants that looked like graham's, on an abandoned property about 8 miles from where she was last spotted five weeks ago. \" i do believe god wanted us to find what we found, \" a sheriff's sergeant says.

Dark matter is called \" dark \" because it can't be seen. It is the mysterious and invisible skeleton of the universe that scientists figure makes up about 27 % of the cosmos. Scientists only know dark matter exists because they can observe how it pushes and pulls things they can see, like stars. It's supposed to be everywhere, reports the ap. But yale university astronomer pieter van dokkum and colleagues spied a vast, old galaxy with relatively few stars where what you see truly is what you get. The galaxy's stars are speeding around with no apparent influence from dark matter, according to a study published in the journal nature. Van dokkum says the galaxy, ngc1052-df2 in the northern constellation cetus, may have formed in the very early universe in a way astronomers don't understand yet. \" there's nothing else, just the stars, \" he says. With measurements from telescopes, van dokkum and colleagues calculated how fast its clusters of densely grouped stars moved. If there were a normal amount of dark matter those clusters would be speeding around at about 67,000mph. Instead, the clusters were moving at about 18,000mph. That's about how fast they would move if there were no dark matter at all, van dokkum says. The team also calculated the total mass of the galaxy and found the stars account for everything, with little or no room left for dark matter.

Citing 12 people with knowledge of the reporting, the huffington post reports farrow had a woman willing to accuse weinstein of rape on camera in silhouette, in addition to a march 2015 audio recording of weinstein admitting to groping a model. At that point, nbc not only rejected the story but told farrow, an nbc news contributor, to stop reporting it. According to huffpo, that final decision came after farrow's reporting was presented to steve burke, president and ceo of nbc universal, an organization weinstein has worked with for decades. Three sources told huffpo it was an odd move since they'd never known burke to review a story before. Offering a different account, the daily beast reports the story wasn't presented to burke and was under review by nbc universal's executive vp kimberley harris when nbc canned it without her input. Still, other sources described how \" it became difficult to tell where the weinstein team's attempts to discredit the story left off and nbc news ' editorial forbearance began, \" reports huffpo. But \" the notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us, \" president noah oppenheim says in nbc news'defense.

The los angeles times reports that toys r us, sears, and target all reported longer lines than usual, and at least one mall also experienced significantly better traffic. Early estimates show sales increased 10 % to 14 %, the ap reports, and retail analysts agree sales are likely up from last year. \"after seeing what i saw last night i can't imagine that this is going to be a one year only shot, \" says one. \"now that we're open at midnight, we're getting an entirely different customer, \" macy's chief executive triumphantly tells reuters, referring to those under age 30 — while the more traditional shoppers still came later. \"people have had so many years of recession that they want to spend money and feel good about themselves, \" says one retail expert. \"and many people have set money aside and are paying off their credit cards more, so people can spend a little bit more than last year. \" even so, another reuters article notes that because many of the shoppers were younger, the overall result may not be beneficial to retailers.

From there, you can embark on the longest sailable straight line possible, reaching russia's karaginsky district some 19,940 miles away, according to researchers. Rohan chabukswar of ireland's united technologies research center tells livescience he loves solving \" particularly fun \" puzzles with his colleague, kushal mukherjee, and the pair \" took it as a challenge \" when they came across a 2012 reddit post claiming the longest straight-line path over water was one from pakistan to russia. After developing their own algorithm, they confirmed patrick anderson's theory was right, reports mit technology review. While anderson had used wikipedia data to trace a path that originated in pakistan, went between mainland africa and madagascar, and continued between antarctica and the southern tip of south america before reaching russia, chabukswar and mukherjee wanted to be more precise, which meant examining some 5 trillion points on earth, per smithsonian. To do this, they created a \" branch-and-bound \" algorithm that \" returned the longest path in about 10 minutes, \" according to their study uploaded to arxiv. On a flat map, the path appears to curve, though it's in fact straight when visualized on a globe. For fun, the researchers also used the algorithm to find the longest straight-line route over land without hitting water. It's a 6,985-mile path starting in china and ending in portugal.

        "summary": "Vladimir putin's decision to reduce the american diplomatic presence in russia in the wake of sanctions passed by congress is raising comparisons to similar tit-for-tat moves during the cold war in the 1980s. In early coverage, two themes are emerging: putin miscalculated on his us strategy, at least with congress, and these diplomatic expulsions are relatively tame: the numbers: some initial confusion greeted putin's initial statement. He's not expelling 755 us diplomats — the us has nowhere near that number in russia. Instead, he's reducing the american embassy and consulate staff by 755 people, reports the ap. And probably about half are local hires doing relatively low-profile administrative work. The cuts will bring the us staff to 455, the same as the russian staff in the us. Verb choice: the confusion stemmed from putin's use of a russian verb that means \" pack up, \" leading to conclusions that these were all expulsions, notes the los angeles times. Backfire: a new york times analysis asserts that putin's bet on better relations with the us under president trump has \" backfired, spectacularly. \" relations between the two leaders seem cordial, but congress is clearly not ready to forgive and forget, meaning \" trump's hands are now tied in dealing with moscow, probably for years to come, \" writes david sanger. Ditto: \" russia perhaps failed to understand the congressional hostility to its activities, mistaking the trump insiders ' lack of concern for the predominant view of the president's supporters on capitol hill, \" writes jonathan marcus at the bbc. Maybe not so bad? analysts in a separate new york times story note that putin acted after congress passed the sanctions but before trump signed them, signaling it's not a move directed at the us president. They also note that staff reductions are, in the grand scheme, relatively harmless, suggesting putin isn't giving up on better ties.'restrained ': an op-ed in the moscow times by vladimir frolov calls the russian move \" relatively restrained, \" but warns things could get nastier. If putin loses all hope trump can deliver on \" grand bargains, \" he might start exploiting \" geopolitical opportunities \" in syria, north korea, afghanistan, and elsewhere and ramp up tensions even higher. Vp mike pence: he's currently on a three-day trip to meet with baltic leaders to assure them the us will back them up if russia makes aggressive moves on the border or through cyberattacks, reports the wall street journal. He meets with the leaders of estonia, lithuania, and latvia on monday",

        "summary": "On the heels of reports chinese ships were transferring oil to north korean vessels in violation of un sanctions, south korea has announced it seized a ship suspected of doing just that last month, the bbc reports. South korean officials say the lighthouse winmore picked up oil supposedly bound for taiwan on oct. 11 at a south korean port before transferring 600 tons of it to a north korean ship days later in international waters. The lighthouse winmore was seized when it returned to south korea in november. According to the new york times, the registered owner of the vessel is hong kong's win more shipping, whose only listed director lives in china. The lighthouse winmore's 25-person crew — almost entirely chinese citizens — will be free to leave south korea following an investigation, south korean officials say. A un security council resolution bans ships from transferring any goods headed to north korea, and president trump recently claimed china had been \" caught red-handed \" facilitating the shipment of oil to north korea. China denies it, and there's no evidence it was involved in any activity involving the lighthouse winmore, which had been leased to a taiwanese company. Diplomats say the us is pushing the un security council to blacklist 10 ships it accuses of violating international sanctions against north korea, the wall street journal reports. But china is apparently only agreeing to blacklist four ships — and the lighthouse winmore isn't one of them. Meanwhile, reuters has an exclusive report that russian tankers have transferred fuel to north korean ships at sea at least three times recently.",
