        "summary": "Uber says it's now making \" house calls, \" at least for one day. The ride-sharing service says that after the success of last year's program, it is offering flu shots to people in 35 cities for $ 10 between 11am and 3pm on thursday, nov. 19, the washington post reports. The shot — technically free, as long as a $ 10 \" wellness pack \" is purchased — comes with a nurse, who will actually deliver up to 10 shots with the purchase of that single pack, meaning you and your co-workers can take care of business for the low, low cost of $ 1 each. Of course, there may be a tussle over who gets to keep the pack, which includes an uberhealth-branded water bottle and tote, tissues, hand sanitizer, and a lollipop. Those who select the uberhealth option via their app are asked to \" select a suitable indoor location prior to uberhealth arriving, \" and the shot may be administered to those ages 4 and up. The nurses will be provided by a company called passport health, which will share the costs of the program with uber and health data-mining firm epidemico, reports the chicago tribune. It adds that 10,000 shots will be available; 2,000 vaccinations were given in just four cities by uber last year. Instructions on how to take part, and a list of all the cities covered, can be found on uber's \" uberhealth \" page. ( last month, uber drivers delivered something soft and fuzzy to cuddle-craving users in 50 cities. )",

        "summary": "President trump's decision to strike a syrian airbase in retaliation for a chemical attack on civilians has bipartisan support — and bipartisan opposition. House speaker paul ryan and sens. John mccain and marco rubio were joined by democrats, including house minority leader nancy pelosi, in voicing their support for what they called an \" appropriate \" and \" proportional \" strike, though the democrats added that congress will have to approve any further escalation, politico reports. Republicans including sens. Rand paul and mike lee, meanwhile, were joined by democrats such as sen. Tim kaine in slamming trump for launching the strikes without congressional approval. In other developments: syria says the strike, which involved around 60 tomahawk missiles launched from us destroyers in the mediterranean, killed six people, wounded several others, and caused \" significant \" damage, the los angeles times reports. A statement from the syrian military denounced the strike as \" blatant aggression \" that will be a setback to its \" counterterrorist \" activity. Deutsche welle reports that the attack was endorsed by european countries, including the uk, france, and germany, where chancellor angela merkel said that bashar al-assad bears \" sole responsibility \" for the strike against his regime's forces. Russia's military says only 23 out of the 59 american missiles reached the shayrat airbase in homs province, the ap reports. The military says the attack destroyed six syrian planes, but left the runway intact. Vladimir putin has denounced the strike as american aggression, a spokesman says. The new york times looks at the risks and opportunities the strike has opened up for trump. There's now an opportunity for the us to demand that russia help get rid of assad — but there's the risk putin might reject any such deal, that the strike could hurt the fight against isis, and that trump's team has no real plan for peace in syria. Syrian opposition groups welcomed the attack and said they hoped it marked the beginning of a wider campaign against assad. \" for syrians, any military intervention that will neutralize assad's ability to continue his genocide will fall on our hearts like music, \" a civil defense volunteer in northern syria tells the los angeles times. The guardian reports that a monitoring group says that despite the us strike, a warplane believed to be russian or syrian carried out an airstrike near khan sheikhoun, the town hit by the chemical attack, on friday.",

If this plot seems a bit tired to you, you're not alone. The movie has a lackluster approval rating of about 50 % among critics on rotten tomatoes, despite big-name stars such as scarlett johannson and kate mckinnon. Samples: rough night \" offers a few sight gags that are pure, dumb genius \" and \" is at its best when it catches the precise crosscurrent between sleazy and breezy. \" but when the movie takes a dark turn, \" it starts to fall apart, \" stephanie zacharek writes at time. \" as hangover-style dumb entertainments go, it's certainly good enough, \" she adds, but she isn't sure this is \" anything close \" to what women want to see. Owen gleiberman, on the other hand, says rough night is \" a perfect example of why hollywood needs ( many ) more women filmmakers. \" though its formula is quite \" derivative, \" its female perspective makes it fresh, he writes at variety. The best elements: \" the feisty, claws-out spontaneity of its competitive banter between'sisters ' who love and hate each other \" and jillian bell, \" the film's comic spark plug. \" leah greenblatt was less tickled. Rough night is \" a raunchy, wildly off-the-rails farce \" that \" feels like the summer-movie equivalent of a fidget spinner: shiny, manic, and spiraling to nowhere, \" she writes at entertainment weekly.

Nearly 50 other unaudited bart janitors also earned in the six figures in 2015. Fellner wants to know, for instance, how the \" superhuman \" zhang worked 17-hour days for 18 days in a row during july 2015, a fact found during an analysis of zhang's timecards, which turned up several \" discrepancies and questions. \" roy aguilera, bart's chief transportation officer, says zhang just grabs extra hours no one wants. But when ktvu gained access to video on bart's security cameras for two random days, it witnessed zhang head into a storage closet and hole up there for hours ( on one day he was in the closet for 90 minutes, then later on for another 78 ). A bart rep says zhang may have been fixing equipment or taking a break, though aguilera tells ktvu there's a dedicated break area elsewhere. Fellner says the situation is a \" catastrophic management failure \" that should've been audited long ago. ( the worst-paying jobs you have to go to college for. )",

He says he heard wood and wagner fighting, and when the noise ceased, he went up on the deck to find wagner standing there solo; davern says wagner insisted they say wood likely slipped and fell into the water. Lana wood sticks by that, too. \" are you suggesting that [ wagner ] knocked her out and threw her in the water? \" mcgraw asked. \" something like that, absolutely, \" she answered. Per us weekly, lana wood also recently appeared on a podcast in which she says that, shortly after her sister's death, hollywood exec rowland perkins informed her wagner was keeping her out of tinseltown. \" he said,'stop trying to get a job in production or acting.

            "Fans of the show south park who watched the season premiere last night got more than the usual fart jokes and foul-mouthed rants: amazon echo and google home devices were woken up throughout the episode, triggered by commands from the characters. Of course, hilarity — or headaches, depending on your point of view — ensued. Before we proceed, it's worth noting that south park contains a great deal of extremely not safe for work language, so you ' ll probably want to put on headphones, turn down the volume, and read this out of earshot of your boss and/or children. In one example in the episode, cartman conducts a veritable potty-mouthed orchestra, getting a group of echo and home devices to repeatedly trigger each other to say things about human genitalia. For the most part, it seems viewers were pretty amused by the stunt, posting clips on twitter showing their devices adding things like \"titty chips \" and \"hairy balls \" to their shopping lists, or setting an unwanted alarm for ( gasp ) 7 a.m. People who owned both devices had double the laughs: we have an alexa and a google home and south park repeatedly screwed with both of them tonight. — jeff s.

Tooke's retirement, which is effective immediately, comes just a few days after a pbs newshour investigation into both the forest service and tooke, who informed his staff he'd be leaving in a wednesday email obtained by politico and buzzfeed. While tooke didn't confirm or deny the allegations against him — allegations that the new york times says haven't yet been spelled out — he says, \" i cannot combat every inaccuracy that is reported in the news media, \" and therefore feels it's best to \" make way for a new leader that can ensure future success for all employees and the agency. \" pbs talked to 34 current and former forest service female workers, who described a hostile work environment that included everything from bullying and sexual harassment to groping and rape. Many women also allege retaliation after they reported these incidents. The forest service says its parent agency, the department of agriculture, has \" engaged an independent investigator \" to look into specific allegations against tooke, who has been with the forest service since he was 18. Tooke wrote in his email that \" i admire the courage \" of the women who've come forward about the forest service and that \" each employee deserves a leader who can maintain the proper moral authority to steer the forest service along this important and challenging course. \" agriculture secretary sonny perdue thanked tooke in a statement for \" his decades of service to this nation and to the conservation of its natural resources. \"",

            "Charlie sheen is suing the porn actress who was with him on the night he damaged a room at new york city's plaza hotel for extortion, abc news learned late monday. The suit claims that actress capri anderson asked for $ 1 million to keep her story out of the press. It also claims anderson stole a $ 165,000 watch from sheen's hotel room. Anderson was not immediately available for comment on the suit. Anderson, who was found in sheen's hotel bedroom when police responded to a call about a disorderly man in the hotel last month, filed a complaint against the actor today with the new york police department after detailing her experience to abc news. Anderson told abc news in her first interview that she was hired that night for $ 3,500 to escort sheen to dinner, but that the night quickly turned violent in a room at the plaza hotel in new york. Sheen, she said, threatened to kill her and called her a \" whore. \" \" i never expected the night would unfold the way it did, \" she told \" good morning america \" today in an exclusive interview. \" he definitely was growing more intense as the night grew and went on. It's hard to say being that it was my first time hanging out with him if it",

The country's police chief said toxicology reports on swabs from the face and eyes of the exiled north korean found vx nerve agent, which the bbc notes is classed as a weapon of mass destruction by the united nations. He said that one of two women believed to have rubbed the extremely toxic substance on kim's face with their hands suffered from vomiting after the attack. The new york times reports that vx agent can be created by mixing two compounds — and police suspect the two women put the substances on kim's face, one after the other, to create a deadly dose. The police chief said the airport where kim was attacked is now being decontaminated. North korea — which is widely suspected to have been behind the killing of leader kim jong un's half brother — never signed the chemical weapons convention that banned vx, the ap notes. Pyongyang denies involvement and says malaysia's investigation is full of \" holes and contradictions. \" the father of one of the two women being held, vietnamese citizen doan thi huong, tells the times his daughter trained as a pharmacist and he has seen little of her in recent years.

        "summary": "The white house has walked back comments made by president trump on friday that he would not sign a \" moderate \" immigration reform bill scheduled for a vote next week. A spokesman said trump had misunderstood the question and does indeed back the measure, reports politico. The tumult erupted as gop leaders put the finishing touches on a pair of republican bills: a hard-right proposal and a middle-ground plan negotiated by the party's conservative and moderate wings, with white house input. Only the compromise bill would open a door to citizenship for young immigrants brought to the us illegally as children ( \" dreamers \" ), and reduce the separation of children from their parents when families are detained crossing the border. When asked about the bills friday in a fox news interview, trump said, \" i certainly wouldn't sign the more moderate one. \" but a senior white house official later said trump had misspoken and believed his fox interviewer was asking about an effort by gop moderates — abandoned for now — that would have forced votes on a handful of bills and likely led to house passage of liberal-leaning versions party leaders oppose, per the ap. The white house later put out a statement formally endorsing the \" moderate \" measure now in the works. Earlier this week, paul ryan had said the president was on board with it.

The former four-star general served as white house chief of staff during the tumultuous final months of the nixon administration — he kept the place running and guided nixon toward a peaceful resignation, reports the washington post — and he ran for the top office himself in 1988. But he's perhaps best known to americans as ronald reagan's secretary of state, who incorrectly told the nation \" i am in control here \" after reagan got shot. Another former reagan aide, lyn nofgizer, said haig knew that despite all his accomplishments, the third paragraph of his obituary would harp on that, notes the new york times — in the third paragraph of its obituary. Prior to the news conference in which he made the declaration, haig told fellow cabinet members that the \" helm is right here, and that means in this chair for now, constitutionally, until the vice president gets here. \" the constitution, of course, disagrees, and haig's words forever earned him the reputation as being hungry for power.",

( this after pope francis in march warned mobsters to repent or \" end up in hell. \" ) specifically, he implies he has information about the 1983 disappearance of emanuela orlandi, the 15-year-old daughter of a vatican employee. Calcara wrote that what happened has been kept secret \" because to reveal it would be like opening a box and bringing to light truths so weighty as to throw into crisis a system that links the vatican with other deviant entities. \" it's not calcara's first run-in with the church: years ago, he claimed that ali agca, who attempted to assassinate pope john paul ii in a st. Peter's square shooting in 1991, was a hitman hired by the mafia, according to the catholic herald. And in 1994, the ap reported calcara claimed that a us archbishop who once ran the vatican bank had helped mobsters launder $ 6.5 million through the bank. That allegation was denied by the cardinal who ran the vatican bank at the time.",

        "summary": "Women's earnings continue to rise slightly every five years between the ages of 20 and 40, at which point the median salary peaks at $ 49,000. From there until retirement 25 years later women's earnings remain flat, while men's salaries continue to grow until into their 50s, at which point the median salary is around $ 75,000, reports marketwatch. This discrepancy persists even when men and women hold the same jobs, according to numbers released by salary comparison site payscale, with a regular pay gap of 2.2 % for most workers and an even higher one, 6.1 %, for executives. Thinkprogress notes that the study shows the wage gap persists in every industry, at every educational level, and at every job level. \" there's discrimination, \" says heidi hartmann, the president of the institute for women's policy research. \" a lot of pay is still based on the head of household model, where expectations that men earn to support their families while women earn money that's just \" nice to have \" persist, she says. \" there's a heck of a lot of inefficiency the way supervisors set wages. \" and while more women do tend to take some time off of work to start a family, this doesn't explain the stalled increase in earnings a full decade before men see the same plateau. Hartmann says that at least some of the difference may be more in the kinds of jobs women are currently taking versus men, and payscale's lead economist backs that up. \" it's not really a wage gap, it's a jobs gap, \" katie bardaro says. Fast company has a more detailed breakdown, ranging from a gender wage gap of 9.4 % in farming, fishing, and forestry, to 1.4 % in personal care and service.

And because the individual mandate is so integral to the aca, the entire aca is unconstitutional as well, he declared.

Those insured under the aca, including those who just enrolled, remain covered. The stakes: here's how the washington post puts it: \" the opinion, if upheld on appeal, would upend the health insurance industry, the way doctors and hospitals function, and the ability of millions of americans to access treatments they need to combat serious diseases. \" core provisions: as the ap notes, key provisions of the aca have become popular with americans, including its protections for pre-existing conditions, expanded medicaid for lower-income americans, and the ability of parents to keep their kids covered through age 26.

The company's $ 10.5 billion annual dividend has become a point of contention as president obama has said bp should not be paying stockholders when fishermen, oil workers and small business owners are saying they cannot get the company to pay their loss claims from the oil spill in the gulf of mexico. The discussions came as mr. Obama headed to the gulf coast on monday, his fourth trip to the region since the disaster struck, and as the company said that it would increase the amount of oil they would recover from the damaged well daily. In answer to a request by the administration over the weekend that bp provide \"a faster plan \" to siphon off and collect the gushing oil, one with \"greater redundancy and reliability, \" the company said in a statement on monday that it would move ahead with improvements to the system being used to siphon oil from the gushing well to boats on the surface, with the aim of increasing the amount of oil and gas it was collecting.

Though he represented clients in bankruptcy and domestic cases, mari wasn't the typical tough-faced litigator, according to fellow cartersville attorney lester tate. \"he's just one of the nicest, most easy-going people you could imagine, \" tate said. Tate said security is big concern for small legal firms, including his own. Armed deputies are present at courthouses, but much of civil litigation takes place in lawyers",
            "Cartersville, ga. ( ap ) — authorities say a georgia man killed his ex-wife's attorney in his law office just hours after the couple's divorce was final and then killed himself. Cartersville police lt. M.e. Bettikofer tells the atlanta journal-constitution that 33-year-old walter samuel radford failed to show up wednesday for the final divorce hearing. The divorce was finalized at 12: 04 p.m. Police say radford shot and killed his ex-wife's attorney in the attorney's cartersville law office about two hours later. Police say 41-year-old lawyer antonio benjamin mari was shot multiple times. Bettikofer says radford called ex-wife cindy radford to tell her he had shot mari. He says radford then broke into her home and shot himself. His body was found about 2: 40 p.m. A colleague said mari had reported being afraid of radford. ___ information from: the atlanta journal-constitution, http://www.ajc.com"

An alarm signaled cops to the theft from the museum in wapakoneta, armstrong's hometown. Police said it was impossible to put a value on the 5-inch cartier-cast replica, which armstrong received in paris shortly after the 1969 mission. Fellow apollo 11 astronauts buzz aldrin and michael collins also got 18-karat models, which were commissioned and paid for by france's le figaro newspaper and its readers. The museum, which closed for several hours on saturday, posted a statement on facebook saying, \" the truth is that you can't steal from a museum. Museum's don't ' own ' artifacts. We are simply vessels of the public trust. … for every day that an item is missing, we are all robbed of an opportunity to enjoy it and our history. \" the fbi was aiding local police in investigating the theft. A retired nasa agent tells the ap the replica could fetch millions among space collectors, but the thieves probably plan to melt it down for its gold. Joseph gutheinz jr. Notes that whoever swiped the statue left behind a large moon rock also worth millions. \" either they didn't have easy access to the moon rock, or they weren't into collectibles, \" gutheinz says. \" they were into turning a quick buck. \" ( thanks to a nasa inventory error, this woman is $ 1.8 million richer. )",

        "summary": "Life of one kind or another has been around on this planet for 300 million years longer than thought, according to us researchers who took a close look at some incredibly ancient crystals unearthed in australia. The scientists say that the zircon crystals from 4.1 billion years ago contain a telltale carbon deposit that appears to have come from something organic, reuters reports. That's getting closer to the origin of the planet itself, roughly 4.5 billion years ago. Before now, the earliest hint of life was found in rocks 3.8 billion years old. There's no chance the carbon deposit could be any younger than the zircon because the crystal is crack-free and undisturbed, the researchers write in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. The zircon crystals were formed during a geological era known as the hadean, after hades, because conditions were thought to be so hellish that no life could have existed, the new scientist notes. The ucla and stanford researchers now dispute that, saying life on earth may have formed \" almost instantaneously \" — and restarted quickly if it were wiped out at some point. \" the early earth certainly wasn't a hellish, dry, boiling planet; we see absolutely no evidence for that, \" study co-author mark harrison says in a ucla press release. \" the planet was probably much more like it is today than previously thought. \" ( earth's first big predator may have been an enormous sea scorpion. )",

That drug is sodium bicarbonate solution, aka baking soda, which is used in chemo regimens, as a poison antidote, and to help patients whose blood has veered into acidic ranges, among other uses. But the nation's two lone suppliers, pfizer and amphastar, are suddenly unable to give medical facilities what they need, causing those facilities to hoard what's left in their own cabinets. \" does the immediate need of a patient outweigh the expected need of a patient? \" says the head pharmacist at a hospital in mobile, ala., calling it a \" medical and ethical question that goes beyond anything i've had to experience before. \" supply problems can arise when things go wrong at the factory level or when suppliers of the raw ingredients have issues, leaving hospital officials irritated at the short notice they receive about a dearth. Right now on the fda website, there are dozens of drugs said to be \" currently in shortage, \" many of them critical generic injectables. Some pharmacy officials even harbor suspicions that manufacturers aren't investing enough to ensure adequate supplies since, per ars technica, generic drugs aren't the moneymakers. Some hospitals have \" compounding pharmacies \" where they whip up their own generic drugs, but that doesn't solve the larger problem. \" it is unbelievably frustrating, \" a university of utah drug shortage expert tells the times, which notes pfizer and amphastar can't guarantee more sodium bicarbonate supplies until at least june and maybe not until august in some cases.

According to a new study from the economic policy institute, walmart's importing of cheap chinese goods resulted in the elimination of 400,000 american jobs between 2001 and 2013 by increasing the us'trade deficit with china. It's an estimate the epi calls \" conservative. \" about three-quarters of those lost jobs were likely manufacturing jobs, fortune reports. \" these job losses are particularly destructive because jobs in the manufacturing sector pay higher wages and provide better benefits than most other industries, especially for workers with less than a college education, \" the study states. The epi estimates walmart is responsible for more than 15 % of the trade deficit growth from 2001 to 2013, costing 3.2 million us jobs. Fortune reports the epi's study is based on a 2007 report and — because walmart doesn't release specifics on its imports — \" guesswork. \" needless to say, walmart disagrees with the epi's findings. \" unfortunately, this is an old report with flawed economic analysis that assumed that imports equal job losses and does not take into consideration that countless jobs are added, \" fortune quotes a walmart statement. Economists agree, pointing to retail and transportation jobs created by importing goods, according to the new york times. In 2013, walmart announced it would increase its use of american-made goods by $ 50 billion over the next decade.

The attack at noblesville west middle school happened around 9am, police chief kevin jowitt said at a news conference, per the ap. He said investigators believe the suspect acted alone, though he didn't release the boy's name or the names of the victims, who were taken to hospitals in indianapolis. Indiana university health spokeswoman danielle sirilla said the teacher was taken to iu health methodist hospital and the wounded student was taken to riley hospital for children. She didn't know the seriousness of their injuries. After the attack, students were bused to the noblesville high school gym, where their families could retrieve them. Usa today reports that the high school then received some kind of threat, which police suggested might have been a hoax. Erica higgins, who was among the worried parents who rushed to get their kids, told wthr-tv that she learned of the shooting from a relative who called her at home. \" i just want to get my arms around my boy, \" she said. Higgins said her son was shaken up but knew little about what happened. \" i got a ' mom, i ' m scared'text message and other than that, it was ' come get me at the high school, ' \" higgins said.",

        "summary": "Since president trump announced thursday he was pulling the us out of the paris climate agreement, france has been relentlessly dragging the white house. Cnn reports the dragging now includes the french government tweeting a remixed version of a white house video on the agreement friday. The new version of the video, created by the french ministry for europe and foreign affairs, pencils in corrections to the original. For example, the white house's video claims the agreement was a \" bad deal for the us \"; it was changed to say leaving the agreement is the bad deal.

Corona regional medical center ceo mark uffer says his staff was horrified by the condition of the seven adults in the group, who were so malnourished that they were mistaken for children. Sophia grant, medical director of the child abuse unit at riverside university health system, tells the press-enterprise that such stunting of growth would have required malnourishment over a long period. She says recovery will be a gradual process for the siblings, who have likely suffered psychological damage from being deprived of normal interaction and from being mistreated by the parents who were supposed to provide for them. In other developments: home-schooling. Father david turpin, a former engineer at the northrop grumman aerospace company registered to run a private school out of his home, was required only to submit a form every year. Advocates for greater oversight of home-schooling in california say the abuse could have been exposed much earlier if the children had been required to have annual checkups from doctors and teachers, the los angeles times reports. \" current law provides nothing to stop families like the turpins from using home-schooling to isolate and imprison their children, \" says rachel coleman of the coalition for responsible home education.",

They say patients should schedule a visit with their doctor, and that the process will take three minutes start to finish, during which time all essential features will run in backup mode, reports consumerist. It's unclear how many people in other countries are affected. Over the past decade, there's been an increase in reports of serious vulnerabilities in pacemakers, insulin pumps, and other medical devices, reports ars technica. That's because they're now outfitted with tiny radio-frequency equipment for remote maintenance that no longer requires new and costly surgeries when the devices need updating. Back in may, engadget reported that security company whitescope found 8,000 bugs hackers could exploit in pacemaker programs alone. While attackers must be within 50 feet of the device to hack into it, and no one has yet to die from a cyber attack, some argue that the mere threat of an attack is reason enough to make these devices as sophisticated and protected as possible.

The buddy-buddy act boxed romney out of national media coverage for days while lending the president some bipartisan street cred. But it wasn't just the storm. Christie had rankled romney's team throughout the campaign: he held back his endorsement as long as possible, flirted with big-shot gop donors who begged him to jump into the race and used his prime-time address at the republican national convention to puff up his garden state record — without mentioning romney once. For romney's aides, dealing with christie's overbearing team was about as pleasurable as a traffic jam on the new jersey turnpike.

As local media have pointed out, the number is probably so high because vatican residents are, in general, older, male, and highly educated, and they eat communal meals.

        "summary": "A relatively new email scam is raking in millions of dollars, and it's got nothing to do with long-lost relatives in nigeria. Instead, as quartz explains, the \" ceo email scam \" dupes employees into wiring money by using bogus messages from the boss. The scammers do their homework: they assume the identity of a company ceo, or sometimes simply send an email so close to the correct email that the recipient never notices the difference. The requests go to someone in the company authorized to deal with money, usually demanding quick action — and confidentiality — because of a pending business deal. It's been so successful that the fbi issued an alert last week, citing complaints in every state and in 79 countries. \" on the surface, business email compromise scams may seem unsophisticated relative to moneymaking schemes that involve complex malicious software, \" writes brian krebs of krebs on security. But the ceo scam is especially effective because of one crucial factor: \" in traditional phishing scams, the attackers interact with the victim's bank directly, but in the ceo scam the crooks trick the victim into doing that for them. \" when it works, a typical haul is between $ 25,000 and $ 75,000. The known haul worldwide is $ 2.3 billion, says the fbi. One cybersecurity expert in france warns that it won't go away any time soon. \" it will spread because it's too good to be ignored, \" he tells the bbc.",

It's one of a group of lifeforms called the ediacaran biota, which the bbc describes as the \" first complex multi-cellular organisms to appear on earth. \" but for decades they've defied definitive classification, with scientists suggesting they could be everything from lichen to giant single-celled amoeba to \" evolutionary dead-ends. \" now, an answer: dickinsonia is an animal that dates back 558 million years, making it the earliest confirmed one in the geological record. That conclusion comes thanks to fat, reports phys.org. Ilya bobrovskiy of australian national university discovered a dickinsonia fossil in 300-foot-high cliffs along the white sea in northwest russia, in a place so remote she reached it via helicopter. The fossil was superbly preserved, so much so that its tissue had cholesterol molecules present in it. \" the fossil fat molecules that we've found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 million years ago, millions of years earlier than previously thought, \" says anu professor jochen brocks, co-author of the paper on the discovery, which was published in science. The cambrian explosion that gave rise to modern animal groups didn't happen for another 20 million years or so. As for the oval dickinsonia's appearance, the bbc describes it as possibly bearing \" a superficial resemblance to a segmented jellyfish. \" national geographic delves into the difficulty of studying ediacarans, who had no shells or bones to leave behind and whose \" squishy bodies have long since decayed. \" read more on how the team overcame that here.",

Some 152,000 of them had to find an alternate way to get to class in the freezing rain this morning, amid a school-bus drivers strike, reports the ny daily news. Schools issued metrocards to affected students so they could take public transportation, and parents who opt to pay for a taxi or drive their kids can fill out forms for reimbursement. But some worry that kids with special needs — more than a third of the children affected — will fall through the cracks, and parents of young students won't receive metrocards allowing them to escort their kids until tomorrow. The strike, the first since the 1970s, could last for days or months, as no negotiations have yet been scheduled between the striking bus driver's union and city officials.

Marc santia has the story of one mother attempting to deal with the added stress. ( published thursday, jan. 17, 2013 ) thousands of parents scrambled for alternate ways to get their children to school and back home wednesday as the school bus drivers union went on strike amid a dispute over job protections in new contracts. Some 152,000 new york city schoolchildren -- or about 14 percent of the public school population -- take the bus. About 54,000 of them have disabilities and face extra hardships traveling to school. Attendance on wednesday was down 2.5 percent overall and as much as 34 percent among the special education population compared to the rest of the month average, officials said. Officials said about 3,000 of 7,700 routes, or 39 percent, were running wednesday, including 100 percent of pre-kindergarten routes and 39 percent of special education routes. Not all the city's school bus routes are driven by the striking union. More than 100 bus drivers reported to picket lines in queens wednesday morning in the city's first school bus strike in more than three decades.

While the dwarf planet tries to fight its way back into the good graces of those who deem what counts as a planet, another icy orb even further out may snatch that designation first. Astronomers at the california institute of technology say a giant celestial body \" lurking at the end of our solar system, \" as the washington post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \" planet nine. \" in their research published in the astronomical journal, the sky-watching scientists — one of whom is known as the \" pluto killer \" for his role in getting pluto demoted — think their find is five to 10 times as massive as earth, and per the ap, almost as big as neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \" pluto killer \" brown and konstantin batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \" massive perturber \" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the post notes. What's interesting is that brown and batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of planet nine. \" we thought their idea was crazy, \" brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what brown calls a \" jaw-dropping moment \" that planet nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet — and they're not concerned it will face pluto's fate. \" that's not even a question — it's definitely a planet, \" brown says. Not everyone's convinced. \" i have seen many, many such claims in my career, \" a planetary scientist at colorado's southwest research institute tells nature. \" and all of them have been wrong. \" ( the washington post caught up with brown for a q&a on the latest pluto-killing endeavor. )",

Louis post-dispatch reports. According to the columbia daily tribune, multiple people informed the school in august that members of delta upsilon had given new members three pills each and told them to drug woman and have sex with them as the final step of initiation. Justin kirk, executive director of delta upsilon, calls the allegations \" deeply concerning \" but notes there have been no claims of sexual assault brought against the frat. But in september, an 18-year-old girl was hospitalized after being possibly drugged, abc 17 reports. She was found naked from the waist down and smearing feces on a wall after drinking at delta upsilon. She didn't see who was making her drinks and didn't remember if she had sex that night. This is just one in a string of problems at delta upsilon — which was temporarily suspended last month by both its national organization and the university of missouri — including underage drinking, physical abuse, at least one assault, and a \" racial incident. \" in september, frat members reportedly yelled racist and sexist slurs at black female students. Members also reportedly forced drunk pledges to fight each other. In one incident of underage drinking last year at delta upsilon, a woman had to be hospitalized. In 2014, the frat removed 90 of its 132 members and hired a live-in graduate student as well as an off-duty police officer to keep an eye on things.

Mccain had recently upset bush in new hampshire and was in a buoyant mood, vowing that, like \"luke skywalker fighting the death star, \" he would not only defeat bush but reform a party corrupted by \"big money \" and, as he later put it, \"agents of intolerance. \" within days, sordid attacks began to appear: flyers on car windows claiming that mccain, who had adopted an orphan from bangladesh, actually had fathered a black child; recorded phone messages, or robo-calls, spreading rumors that mccain's wife, cindy, who had once been addicted to prescription painkillers, was a junkie; and lies, propagated by an obscure group of vietnam veterans, suggesting that mccain had become a traitor while serving in vietnam. Mccain's response was decisive: he pulled from television his negative advertisements, and announced to supporters, \"if we don't prevail, my friends, we know that we have taken the honorable way.",
            "George w. Bush's bombastic return to the world stage has reminded me of my favourite bush anecdote, which for various reasons we couldn't publish at the time. Some of the witnesses still dine out on it. The venue was the oval office. A group of british dignitaries, including gordon brown, were paying a visit. It was at the height of the 2008 presidential election campaign, not long after bush publicly endorsed john mccain as his successor. Naturally the election came up in conversation. Trying to be even-handed and polite, the brits said something diplomatic about mccain's campaign, expecting bush to express some warm words of support for the republican candidate. Not a chance. \"i probably won't even vote for the guy, \" bush told the group, according to two people present.\"i had to endorse him. But i'd have endorsed obama if they'd asked me. \" endorse obama? cue dumbfounded look from british officials, followed by some awkward remarks about the washington weather. Even gordon brown's poker face gave way to a flash of astonishment. To be fair, this wasn't completely unexpected. The degree of enmity between bush and mccain — particularly following their legendarily dirty fight in the 2000 south carolina primary — is hard to exaggerate. Indeed bush is"

Chambers was arrested in essex on jan. 17, and police suspected the alleged drug dealer had swallowed his stash — and decided to wait him out. It didn't work after what sky news reports was seven court hearings in which police sought custody extensions, and even though chambers ate and drank daily.

He was released on bail; chambers was then taken to a hospital and treated. The bbc reports it's believed to be the longest anyone in custody has gone without pooping, though the human body can go longer.

The bbc and guardian report on the court's ruling that the seriously ill 23-month-old — who suffers from a rare degenerative neurological disorder and who was taken off life support monday — can now return home from alder hey children's hospital or be placed in hospice, but that his parents, tom evans and kate james, can't bring him to a rome hospital for further treatment. Although justice anthony hayden described the toddler as \" a fighter, resilient, courageous and a warrior, \" he doesn't think further treatment will make any difference in alfie's condition and that his parents should take this \" special opportunity \" to spend time with him, not waste it on what he sees as futile treatment and legal battles. Hayden also rejected claims by alfie's father that the boy was doing \" significantly better \" after alfie was said to have breathed without machinery for 20 hours after being taken off life support. \" the brain cannot regenerate itself and there is virtually nothing of his brain left, \" hayden argued. Alfie's parents are appealing hayden's decision and tell the bbc they have an appointment at the appeals court set for wednesday. They'd like alfie to receive care at bambino gesu hospital, which has ties to the vatican. \" i ' m not giving up because alfie is breathing away, \" evans says. \" he is not suffering, he is not struggling; he is fighting. \" both pope francis and italian authorities have supported the family's desire to bring alfie to rome, with the pope saying \" only god can decide who dies, \" per cbs news.

Molins said during the press conference that two suspects were dead and eight arrested, though he said he can't yet id them, per the guardian. He added that neither abaaoud nor salah abdeslam were among those arrested.

The suspected terror cell was caught just in time, per authorities. \" a new team of terrorists was neutralized and all indications are that given their arms, their organizational structure, and their determination, the commando could have struck, \" molins said, per afp.",

Even prominent conservatives hailed her \" apolitical \" show, the washington post notes, with tweeted praise from the likes of fox news, marco rubio, and even ivanka trump. But vanity fair reports that an \" edgy political statement \" may have been a \" dog whistle \" for president trump protesters with gaga's choice of opening songs, a double hit of irving berlin's \" god bless america \" followed by a portion of \" this land is your land \" — and the latter woody guthrie song is where gaga's hidden message may lie. Guthrie's son arlo has said his dad wrote \" this land \" as a biting response to berlin's patriotic song, and in the 1944 version the elder guthrie recorded on his guitar — he owned one sporting a \" this machine kills fascists \" sticker — the fourth verse contains some interesting ( and timely trump-tied lyrics ) that have since fallen out of the versions we hear today. To wit: \" there was a big high wall there that tried to stop me / the sign was painted, said ' private property ' / but on the backside, it didn't say nothing. \" vanity fair notes that trump protesters have been crooning the song at rallies lately, and arlo guthrie and other singers like bruce springsteen keep the original lyrics in when they perform the song. In other words, teen vogue may have picked up on something major outlets missed. ( gaga made a big announcement after the super bowl. )",

Letson, who is black, simply wanted to save him. Running into the crowd, letson jumped on top of the man in order to protect him. A series of videos posted to twitter show letson, in a red shirt, shielding the man's body and attempting to push the assailants away. \" what came to me was that he was a human being, and i didn't want to see anybody die, \" letson, host of podcast reveal from the center for investigative reporting, tells npr. \" in retrospect, it doesn't matter if he doesn't see my humanity, what matters to me is that i see his. \" letson tells slate that the unidentified protester had been with joey gibson of right-wing group patriot prayer during the mostly peaceful rally. But after gibson began \" antagonizing the black bloc, \" 20 to 30 others began chasing them. Gibson fled but his apparent companion \" stumbled — or someone tripped him — and then four or five people surrounded him and began to kick and hit him, \" letson says. When he noticed \" a whole mass of people coming, \" letson says he intervened in fear for the man's life. Though he was struck a few times, he'd do it all again, per reveal. \" i remember seeing the pictures of a young man being brutally beaten by these guys with poles [ in charlottesville ], and when i saw that i thought, \" why didn't anybody step in? \" he says.",
