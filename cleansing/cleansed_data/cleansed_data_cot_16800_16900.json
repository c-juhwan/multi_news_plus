        "summary": "A california woman is suing mcdonald's for more than $ 2m over a hot coffee spill — and no, you aren't living in a 1990s time warp. Joan fino, 74, says that coffee she ordered from a mcdonald's drive-through spilled on her lap, inflicting second-degree burns to her groin area. Though the incident occurred in august 2012, fino says \" it still hurts, \" reports the fresno bee. \" i have trouble sleeping because the burning sensation doesn't go away. \" and just like her famous predecessor ( 79-year-old stella liebeck, who also ordered at a drive-through ), she's arguing that mcdonald's intentionally overheats its coffee because the \" scalding \" temps keep it fresher longer, allowing the company to save money, ktrk reports. Fino's lawyer thinks her case is even stronger than liebeck's because a mcdonald's worker handed fino her coffee; liebeck was in the passenger seat when she was burned. Mcdonald's coffee lovers will soon be able to heat the brew to the temp of their choosing: the company this week announced that it would begin selling its coffee in grocery stores.",

But he apparently did not specify who ordered that mission. Saudi arabia had previously blamed \" rogue \" agents, saying a fistfight between them and khashoggi inside the saudi consulate in istanbul escalated out of control. But the new statement from the saudi foreign ministry says it has reversed its view based on evidence from turkish investigators. It didn't provide details, but turkey says it has audio of the killing — audio that cia chief gina haspel is believed to have heard during her trip to turkey this week. Both the washington post and reuters report that haspel listened to the recording. It remains unclear how turkish officials obtained the audio, but turkish media reports have previously said it makes clear that the killing of khashoggi was both deliberate and brutal. A source familiar with the audio tells the post it is indeed \" compelling. \" haspel is back in the us and is expected to brief president trump on thursday, reports cnn. Trump made his strongest remarks yet against saudi arabia on tuesday, calling khashoggi's killing the \" worst cover-up ever. \" the revelation that haspel listened to the audio is expected to prompt congress to ask her to brief lawmakers as well.

His philadelphia-bound flight was supposed to take off just before 7 a.m. American airlines nixed the flight and is working to rebook passengers onto other planes. \"safety is our highest priority and we apologize to our customers for the disruption to their travel plans. We are assisting local law enforcement. Further questions should be referred to them, \" the airline said in a statement.

The facebook ceo on monday evening wrote that he has \" a physical challenge for 2016 as well \": run 365 miles. And he'd like you to do it with him. As he explains, he \" really enjoyed \" experiencing a year of books with the facebook community in 2015, reading \" along with thousands of people across the world. \" a year of running, as he's calling it, will similarly live as a public group \" where we can all discuss our running adventures and i ' ll post periodically on my progress. \" ( at the time of this writing it counted 64,000 members. ) zuckerberg ends by framing the challenge as \" a lot of running, but it's not a crazy amount. It's a mile a day, and at a moderate pace it's less than 10 minutes of running per day. \" easy, right? wrong, writes chris taylor at mashable, or, at least, a little bit wrong. Taylor acknowledges that a daily mile is indeed not a wild amount, but he suggests it ' ll take up a wee bit more of your day than zuckerberg indicates. \" a ' less than ' 10-minute mile is nowhere near what a beginner would call a ' moderate pace. ' it's quite fast, even for many experienced runners. \" taylor recommends recalibrating those expectations at more like 12 or 13 minutes. Expect to be speedier, and \" you're not only going to be sorely disappointed, you're also going to be extremely sore, out of breath and unlikely to keep it up for a year. \" of course, if you do want to run your fastest mile ever, gq has some tips; on the flip side, if the idea of even finishing a mile seems impossibly awful, there are plans to help you get there.

The skulls would have been formed into the creepy tower, around 19.5 feet in diameter, after a period of public display. It was once part of the chapel of huitzilopochtli, aztec god of the sun, war, and human sacrifice. So far, the team has found 676 skulls and the excavation is continuing.

        "summary": "New numbers on health insurance costs probably won't have employers tripping over themselves to make new hires: the average annual cost of a family premium paid by employers spiked 9 % this year to $ 15,073, reports the new york times. For single workers, the figure rose 8 % to $ 5,429, notes the wall street journal. Why the big hikes? at least part of the reason is likely because insurers are getting in hefty increases while they can before tougher new rules take effect next year under president obama's overhaul. The higher premiums paid by employers comes as more employees pay higher deductibles and co-pays. About 50 % of workers at small companies have yearly deductibles of at least $ 1,000, up from 16 % in 2006, notes the washington post. \"without any real national discussion or debate, there's a quiet revolution going on in what we call health insurance in this country, \" says the president of the kaiser family foundation, which conducted the survey of employers. \" health insurance is becoming less and less comprehensive. … and we expect that trend to continue. \"",

A new study by the kaiser family foundation, a nonprofit research group that tracks employer-sponsored health insurance on a yearly basis, shows that the average annual premium for family coverage through an employer reached $ 15,073 in 2011, an increase of 9 percent over the previous year. \"the open question is whether that's a one-time spike or the start of a period of higher increases, \" said drew altman, the chief executive of the kaiser foundation. The steep increase in rates is particularly unwelcome at a time when the economy is still sputtering and unemployment continues to hover at about 9 percent. Many businesses cite the high cost of coverage as a factor in their decision not to hire, and health insurance has become increasingly unaffordable for more americans. Over all, the cost of family coverage has about doubled since 2001, when premiums averaged $ 7,061, compared with a 34 percent gain in wages over the same period. How much the new federal health care law pushed by president obama is affecting insurance rates remains a point of debate, with some analysts suggesting that insurers have raised prices in anticipation",

A similar recent survey by the consulting firm mercer found that yearly premium increases have been hovering around the 6 percent mark and will grow by slightly less in 2012. Both sources point to the same fundamental long-term shift: faced with continually climbing premiums, a record share of employers have moved to plans that require workers to pay more out of pocket. \"without any real national discussion or debate, there's a quiet revolution going on in what we call health insurance in this country, \" said drew altman, president of the kaiser foundation, which conducted the annual survey of employers in conjunction with the health research &amp; educational trust. \"health insurance is becoming less and less comprehensive....

Follow the policies to the letter, and you can't speak to your spouse about \" whether [ you ] think [ your ] boss could do a better job, \" or employ all the skills learned at google at your next job, the suit claims. More egregiously, it alleges the policies bar employees from telling government regulators, attorneys, or the press about any \" wrongdoing. \" that includes sending an email that says, \" i think we violated this contract, \" notes sfist. The guardian notes that if the worker prevails, 75 % of the penalty would go to the state coffers, with the rest shared by google employees. That ceiling for the penalty is nearly $ 4 billion. Google called the suit \" baseless \" and says in a statement that \" transparency is a huge part of our culture. Our employee confidentiality requirements are designed to protect proprietary business information. \" ( here's what every state was googling in 2016. )",

            "This still from the trailer for the forthcoming film adaptation of the dystopian tech company novel the circle is intended as an example of the kind of literature google employees would, according to a new lawsuit, be barred from publishing without company approval. A lawsuit filed in california superior court in san francisco on tuesday on behalf of a former google employee identified as a \" john doe \" alleges that the mountain view-based tech company insists upon internal privacy policies that violate labor laws, constituting a \" spying program \" that prevents employees from discussing potential regulatory, legal, and workplace conditions violations and encouraging employees to report on their colleagues who might do so. The information reported on the suit, filed under california's private attorneys general act, which allows doe to sue on behalf of his coworkers and provide, in the event he should win the case, a serious payout that would go to the state of california and the 65,000 employees and former employees affected by the allegedly illegal policies. Google defines confidential information incredibly broadly, the suit claims, while failing to make plain in its many policies surrounding confidentiality that employees are legally allowed to speak with outsiders, including government agencies and the press, about the company under certain circumstances. One privacy policy at google allegedly defines confidential information as \"without limitation, any information in any form that relates to google or google's business that is not generally known, \" and per the company's code of conduct policy, confidential information is \"everything at google. \" the extent of the supposedly draconian privacy restrictions at the technology company borders on the absurd: writing \" a novel about someone working at a tech company in silicon valley, \" without authorization from google, for instance, would be prohibited, or so the lawsuit alleges. The suit even describes a \" stop leaks \" program that asks of employees that they turn over \" suspicious activity reports \" relating to \"strange things you observe or strange things that happen to you — like someone asking you really detailed questions about your project or job. \" further, the suit contends that employees are instructed, bluntly, \"don't send an email that says 'i think we broke the law ' or 'i think we violated this contract.

        "summary": "Your carry-on bag might be getting downsized. In an effort to regulate carry-on sizes internationally, the world's largest airline group, the international air transport association, has proposed a standard carry-on size of 21.5 inches long by 13.5 inches wide by 7.5 inches deep, report the los angeles times. Unfortunately, that's slightly smaller than the size most american fliers will be used to and 40 % smaller than the iata's previous standard — \" the equivalent of four soccer balls ' worth less volume, \" reports quartz. Delta air lines, american airlines, jetblue, and united airlines limit carry-ons to 22 inches by 14 inches by 9 inches — a difference of almost 600 cubic inches — while southwest allows even larger bags, reports nbc news. The proposed standard size hasn't been adopted across the board yet — it's only a guideline now — but up to 40 airlines are interested in implementing it. Emirates, lufthansa, and qatar airlines have already agreed, according to iata rep tom windmuller. \" we are confident that over the next several months we will get a number of major airlines coming on board, \" he says. \" this should bring a degree of standardization to the industry and make it easier for everyone concerned. \" he adds the size was based on talks with boeing and airbus and will ensure all passenger bags can fit in overhead compartments, per afp. The group is already collaborating with luggage makers to produce bags that meet the exact specifications; they ' ll include a logo, showing the luggage meets iata rules, and will be out later this year. \" the passenger will know that if he or she buys this bag, they ' ll be able to take it on board a growing number of airlines, that you don't need to be concerned about the size of the bag, \" windmuller says.",

The observational study, published in the journal obstetrics &amp; gynecology, found that women diagnosed with some kind of sleep disorder were more likely to give birth early, reports the new york times. Overall, 15 % of such women had preemies, compared to 11 % among women without a sleep disorder. More specifically, a diagnosis of insomnia raised the risk of having a pre-term birth by 30 % and sleep apnea by 40 %. Similarly, sleep disorders were associated with more births characterized as \" very premature, \" reports nature. The study found that 5.3 % of women with such disorders delivered 34 weeks or earlier, compared with 2.9 % for those without a disorder. \"it seems obvious, but strangely this study has not been done before, \" says co-author laura jelliffe-pawlowski, an epidemiologist at the university of california, san francisco. \" seeing this relationship is important because we are just starved for interventions that can make a difference. \" the authors make clear they're referring to women with diagnosed problems, not merely to women who occasionally have trouble sleeping while pregnant, which is fairly common. They found that sleep disorders are more common among women who are black, 35 or older, obese, and have other medical issues, reports reuters.

Over all, women with sleep disorders had a 14.6 percent prevalence of preterm birth ( before 37 weeks of gestation ), compared with 10.9 percent in those without a diagnosis. Those with insomnia had a 30 percent increased risk, and those with sleep apnea a 40 percent increased risk, compared with women without a sleep problem.

            "Women with insomnia or other sleep problems have an increased risk of giving birth prematurely, a new study suggests. The observational study, in obstetrics &amp; gynecology, included 2,172 women with a sleep disorder who gave birth between 2007 and 2012 to single children after 22 to 44 weeks of gestation. They were matched with the same number of women with the identical ethnic, health and behavioral characteristics, but who did not have a sleep disorder. Over all, women with sleep disorders had a 14.6 percent prevalence of preterm birth ( before 37 weeks of gestation ), compared with 10.9 percent in those without a diagnosis. Those with insomnia had a 30 percent increased risk, and those with sleep apnea a 40 percent increased risk, compared with women without a sleep problem. Women with insomnia were nearly twice as likely to deliver before 34 weeks gestation. \"more severe sleep disorders are often",

Study suggests. Compared with women who didn't have sleep problems, women with insomnia were 30 percent more likely to have a preemie and the odds for women with sleep apnea, a breathing disorder, were 50 percent higher, the study found. \"it is normal to experience sleep changes during pregnancy - often due to discomfort, pain or frequent trips to the bathroom, \" said lead study author jennifer felder, of the university of california, san francisco. \"the current study focused on more impairing sleep problems that were severe enough to result in a sleep disorder diagnosis, \" felder said by email.

It is not known when or where the video was shot. \" can you believe this, and what democrats are allowing to be done to our country? \" trump wrote in his tweet. Gaetz went further, wondering whether someone such as george soros was funding the caravan. Gaetz initially said the footage was from honduras, where most of the migrants in the caravan are from, but he later posted a correction after questions sprang up: \" because a honduran government official sent me this video, i believed it came from honduras. \" during his rally, trump said democrats favored the caravan because they assume \" everybody coming in \" will vote for them. \" they wanted that caravan and there are those that say that caravan didn't just happen, \" he added. \" it didn't just happen. \"",

Tony had apparently suffered a catastrophic medical emergency — doctors don't know if it was a stroke, aneurysm, seizure, or other medical event — and the car he was driving smashed into the side of a mountain then rolled into a ditch. Tony was unresponsive, and jill was trapped in her seat, pinned and in shock. She also couldn't move because it turned out she had broken her back in the accident. Her cellphone flung out of reach, jill recruited ryder ( both boys were ok in the back seat ) to grab his dad's phone and call 911. She was whisked to a nearby medical center and given an emergency c-section, which produced another healthy son, leedan. But as she was waiting to hear more about her back injury, the worst news of all was delivered: tony had died. \" he was such a positive person, \" the 35-year-old says of her broncos-loving husband, who 9news says was 37. \" he just always believed the best in everyone, and that's what i want them to remember. \" a gofundme page set up for jill ( who's expected to make a full recovery ) and her boys has raised more than $ 77,000 as of publishing time — and it notes that mom and sons will be rooting \" extra hard \" for the broncos in sunday's super bowl.",

In what gizmodo calls a \" medical first, \" doctors in sao paulo, brazil, implanted that woman's reproductive organ after her death in a 32-year-old patient who was born without a uterus, and just over a year later, that second woman gave birth to a baby girl who now seems to be doing well. The birth was a c-section, and doctors apparently had no issues during the procedure. The \" case of [ live birth ] via deceased donor \" is outlined in the lancet journal, which notes the new mother suffers from a rare congenital condition called mayer-rokitansky-kuster-hauser syndrome that leaves sufferers with either an underdeveloped uterus or none at all, though their external genitals are typically unaffected. Four months before the september 2016 transplant, the recipient went through ivf that resulted in eight good embryos, which were put on ice. She then had the 10-hour transplant surgery, and after a round of drugs so her body wouldn't reject the uterus, an embryo was implanted seven months later. The patient soon was confirmed pregnant and gave birth in december 2017; the uterus was taken out after the birth. The bbc notes there've been around 40 womb transplants, resulting in about a dozen live births, but none of those donors were deceased. One doctor calls the development an \" extremely exciting \" one, as finding live donors who want to give up their uterus can be difficult. Cnn notes the baby, now almost a year old, is doing fine, as is the mother. ( america's first uterus transplant failed just one day after being deemed a success. )",

Nasa scientist philip lubin says that by swapping out the current fuel-based rocket propulsion system with one relying on photons would significantly boost our space travel speeds, reports reuters. Science alert explains it like this: particles of light from lasers in earth's orbit would reflect off a \" large, reflective sail \" on a spacecraft and produce a thrust capable of sending it toward a destination at insane speeds. Lubin estimates a 220-pound probe could reach mars in as little as 72 hours, reports wired. A bigger, manned spacecraft would take about a month; experts believe the space launch system currently in development could take humans to mars in about five months. If all that isn't intriguing enough, lubin says \" photonic propulsion \" opens up the possibility of travel outside our solar system, per space.com. \" the human factor of exploring the nearest stars and exoplanets would be a profound voyage for humanity, one whose non-scientific implications would be enormous, \" lubin writes in a study. \" there are recent advances that take this from science fiction to science reality, \" he adds in a youtube video. \" there is no known reason why we cannot do this. \" ( nasa says there will be humans on mars by the 2030s. )",

Human excursions to the stars are cursed by math. To get there in any reasonable amount of time, spacecraft must go incredibly fast — but fast travel requires carrying more propellant.

The rare condition, which has been surging since 2014, affects the nervous system and can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs. It has no specific treatment, though various treatments are being tried. The health official said cases have been confirmed in 22 states, but cnn recently reached out to health departments in every state, and 30 of them said they had confirmed or suspected cases. Per cnn's analysis, colorado had the highest number of confirmed cases at 14. It's still not clear what causes afm, but one of the most likely culprits is a virus. \" this is likely a rare complication from a common virus, \" one expert tells cnn. \" the most common etiology is probably a viral infection that starts off the process, and there's probably several different viruses that can cause acute flaccid myelitis. \" it's also possible environmental toxins or genetic factors come into play. Symptoms include sudden limb weakness, loss of muscle tone and reflexes, facial and eyelid drooping, difficult swallowing, slurred speech, and difficulty moving the eyes. In severe cases, difficulty breathing can also occur. Some recover quickly from the illness while others require long-term care; there was one reported death in 2017.

The lancer dermatology procedure is said to firm and lift the skin. More strange beauty procedures of the stars: in 2011, nicole \" snooki \" polizzi of jersey shore fame told conan o ' brien she uses kitty litter as a facial exfoliant, radar reports. \" they've got rocks in there... It makes your skin really smooth, \" she said. \" i haven't broken out yet! \" the weird thing tom cruise puts on his face? bird poop. The actor is a fan of an expensive facial involving nightingale excrement. And he's not the only one: jessica simpson has also tried bird poop facial cream. Simon cowell gets his vitamins... By injecting them intravenously. The american idol judge said the procedure makes him look and feel younger, but he got a \" bad science \" award from scientists who say it's probably not really benefiting him at all. Only the best for angelina jolie: she reportedly uses la pairie's skin caviar luxe cream to fend off wrinkles, and it's exactly what it sounds like — a cream made with fish eggs.

In an exclusive, the guardian reveals new york lawyer stanley cohen — who has represented osama bin laden's son-in-law — convinced al-qaeda-linked clerics abu muhammad al-maqdisi and abu qatada, as well as an unnamed al-qaeda veteran and former guantanamo prisoner, to negotiate with isis on kassig's behalf while the fbi kept watch. If isis promised to end its hostage-taking and free kassig, the clerics vowed al-qaeda's religious figures would end their public censure of the terrorist group. Negotiations began in jordan in mid-october, but all did not go as planned. As maqdisi planned to call his isis contact, an oct. 22 document was drawn up to protect the cleric from jordanian authorities; it stated jordan would not \" file charges against him for the calls or otherwise interrogate him about them. \" a washington counterterrorism official told cohen \" the call is a go, \" and days after maqdisi began communicating with his contact via whatsapp, he said he believed kassig would be freed. But on oct. 27, maqdisi was arrested by jordanian officials for \" using the internet to promote and incite views of jihadi terrorist organizations \" and the talks ended. Abu qatada confirms the events to the guardian. Cohen says he feels betrayed. \" we lost a golden opportunity to not only save kassig but other potential hostages, \" he says. An official says the fbi didn't give or receive assurances that anyone would be safe from penalties; the guardian reports the bureau did agree to pay $ 24,000 of cohen's expenses, and cohen believes the fbi may have tried to get maqdisi freed.

The ultimately unsuccessful initiative to save him was the brainchild of a controversial new york lawyer, stanley cohen, who has represented osama bin laden's son-in-law and members of hamas in us courts.

The callers were palestinians from the sabra and shatila refugee camp in lebanon who knew kassig, and they were \"very upset \", cohen recalled. They had just seen the footage of alan henning, a british hostage, being beheaded. At the end of the video, when the masked terrorist who has been dubbed \"jihadi john \" paraded another hostage before the camera, they recognised their friend peter. Kassig had done relief and medical work in sabra and shatila, and even helped raise money for the refugees, before he was kidnapped in october 2013. \"he's a good guy, \" the callers told cohen. Given the pace of previous isis executions – roughly once a fortnight since august – they feared kassig might have only two weeks left to live.

Kassig – who converted to islam while imprisoned for more than a year – was the most recent western hostage to be killed by isis. The jihadi group announced his death on 16 november with a typically grisly video. The ultimately unsuccessful initiative to save him was the brainchild of a controversial new york lawyer, stanley cohen, who has represented osama bin laden's son-in-law and members of hamas in us courts. Cohen persuaded two senior clerics aligned with al-qaida to intervene with isis on behalf of the american. One, abu muhammed al-maqdisi, is regarded as the world's most influential living jihadi scholar, while the other, abu qatada, was once branded by",
            "The american aid worker was killed by his isis captors on 16 november. Here, for the first time, is the story of an extraordinary effort to secure his release, which involved a radical new york lawyer, the us government, and the world's most revered jihadi scholar on the evening of 3 october, the new york attorney stanley cohen got a phone call about peter kassig, the young american aid worker held hostage by islamic state ( isis ). The callers were palestinians from the sabra and shatila refugee camp in lebanon who knew kassig, and they were \"very upset \", cohen recalled. They had just seen the footage of alan henning, a british hostage, being beheaded. At the end of the video, when the masked terrorist who has been dubbed \"jihadi john \" paraded another hostage before the camera, they recognised their friend peter. Kassig had done relief and medical work in sabra and shatila, and even helped raise money for the refugees, before he was kidnapped in october 2013. \"he's a good guy, \" the callers told cohen. Given the pace of previous isis executions – roughly once a fortnight since august – they feared kassig might have only two weeks left to live. They were desperate to save him, and thought that cohen would have contacts among militants in"

Five out of 17 building cooling towers that were inspected turned out to harbor the bacteria, which is spread through airborne water droplets, abc7 reports. Officials say the buildings, including a hotel and a hospital, have been disinfected, and bronx borough president ruben diaz jr. Says he wants the city to prevent future outbreaks by making sure cooling systems are inspected and regulated in the same way that elevators are, the new york daily news reports. Legionnaires expert william f. Mccoy agrees that better inspection and management could have prevented the outbreak. \" there's no technical or scientific reason that anyone should ever get sick from the water in their buildings, and yet it happens because we don't manage the water the way we should, \" he tells the new york times. Bronx residents — some of whom have been stocking up on bottled water despite having been assured that drinking water isn't the source of the bacteria — say the outbreak isn't just bad luck. \" they're putting our health at risk, \" a retired truck driver tells the daily news. \" but they don't care because this is a poor neighborhood. \" ( researchers warn that hospital water features can spread the disease. )",

        "summary": "A pair of retired air force psychologists who had never interrogated anybody before were paid a fortune to devise the cia's \" enhanced interrogation \" program, according to yesterday's senate intelligence committee report. The psychologists — identified in earlier reports as jim mitchell and bruce jessen — helped develop interrogation techniques for the cia starting in 2002 and conducted many waterboardings themselves. They set up their own firm in 2005, and the senate report says the cia outsourced \" virtually all aspects \" of the program to it, paying the contractors $ 81 million before their $ 180 million contract was terminated in 2009, the telegraph reports. The senate report says neither man had specialized knowledge of al-qaeda, \" a background in counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise. \" mitchell and jessen — who accused agents who failed to use waterboarding and other \" enhanced \" techniques of running a \" sissified \" interrogation program — had experience not in real interrogations, but in running a cold war-era training program on what captured airmen could expect from communist interrogators, reports the new york times. To devise their techniques, they drew on the \" learned helplessness \" theory concept developed by psychologist martin seligman. Seligman, considered a top expert on human happiness, tells new york that he is \" grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes. \" when contacted by abc, mitchell described the senate report as \" a steaming pile of horse crap. \"",

West mountain, utah county — police tracked gps signals from 911 calls to find a man accused of detaining a teenage family member and pointing a loaded rifle at her while he was drunk.

Economic sanctions imposed against iran, cuba and sudan, one of the sources said. Credit agricole and socgen have disclosed that they are reviewing whether they violated u.s. Sanctions. Socgen said in its latest annual report that it is engaged in discussions with the treasury department's office of foreign assets control over potential sanctions violations. Socgen and credit agricole declined to comment on tuesday. Another source said the justice department's bank integrity unit is deep into a probe of whether citigroup's banamex usa operation failed to police money transfers across the u.s.-mexico border. Citigroup has said it is cooperating with the inquiry, which also involves the federal deposit insurance corp. Citigroup spokeswoman molly meiners declined comment. Separately, citigroup is investigating an alleged fraud involving $ 565 million in loans at banamex and as a result of that has fired a dozen employees. Prosecutors have also investigated potential sanctions breaches at deutsche bank, according to people familiar with the probe, though it is unclear how far that has progressed. The bank said in its last annual report that it had received requests for information from regulatory agencies and is cooperating with them. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The timing of any possible legal action or related settlement negotiations is unclear. The pipeline of cases has built up as u.s. Prosecutors have",

One gop senator said that most at the lunch were more concerned about \" getting the hell out of town \" before the coming snowstorm arrived. The response from the right has mostly been muted.

        "summary": "Polygamy is still illegal in utah, as the us supreme court has declined to hear arguments against the lower court ruling that kept it so. Kody brown and his four wives — the stars of tlc's sister wives — have for years been seeking to remove the penalties for polygamy in utah, and in december 2013, a federal judge ruled in their favor and effectively decriminalized polygamy in the state. But in april of last year, an appeals court overturned that decision, reinstating the polygamy ban. On monday, the supreme court let that appeals court ruling stand, the ap reports. The problem for the browns is that they've never actually been prosecuted for polygamy. They argued that utah's law in and of itself, along with a 2010 police investigation of their family, constituted discrimination against their family; the appeals court disagreed. One expert explains to the salt lake tribune that a prosecutor would likely have to actually charge consenting adult polygamists with a crime, and for those consenting adults to show that prosecution had harmed them, in order for the supreme court to address the issue — but, he says, it's unlikely any prosecutor will ever do so, instead focusing any charges on polygamy cases that involve alleged sexual abuse, fraud, or underage marriage.",

Though he has shared documents relating to his public account, jeb@jeb.org, those emails reference another account, jeb@gencom.net, to which some 400 emails were sent between 1999 and 2004. A bush rep tells the ap, \" he doesn't know what that email address is. \" even so, the emails did make their way to the governor, though he only ever replied via his public account. At least one response included the note: \" please respond to jeb@jeb.org. \" people also wrote to bush at jeb@jebbush.org or jeb@myflorida.com. The ap notes \" there's no indication this other account was used in any improper or secretive way \" and many people wrote to both jeb@jeb.org and jeb@gencom.net when trying to contact him. The latter address was traced to electronet broadband communications of tallahassee. Emails sent to the address covered a range of topics, from judicial appointments to state literacy issues.

        "summary": "President trump's travel ban on citizens of seven countries continued to cause chaos and protests at airports around the country and around the world sunday, though an administration official insisted it was a \" massive success, \" reuters reports. The attorneys general of 15 states denounced the trump order as unconstitutional, and in canada — where the us consulate in toronto will be closed monday because of a planned protest — officials announced that anybody stranded in the country because of the trump order will be granted temporary residency. In other coverage: republican sens. Lindsey graham and john mccain issued a statement sunday warning that the ban could become a \" self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism, \" cnn reports. Trump tweeted that the statement was \" wrong. \" he accused the senators of being \" sadly weak on immigration \" and urged them to focus on the issue \" instead of always looking to start world war iii. \" after much confusion and conflicting statements about whether the order would apply to green card holders, the department of homeland security said sunday evening that legal residents would be presumed exempt from the ban, though there will still be \" case-by-case determinations, \" the new york times reports. Officials said 392 green card holders had already been issued waivers to travel, though it's not clear how many more are still stuck overseas. Politico looks at early immigrant rights groups ' court victories against the ban, and warns that some of them are unlikely to last. The american civil liberties union says it smashed fundraising records in the wake of the ban, raising $ 24 million in online donations over the weekend, usa today reports. That's six times what the aclu raises in a typical year, executive director anthony romero says. The washington post profiles ann donnelly, the rookie federal judge who issued the first order against the ban in an effort to save a syrian refugee at immediate risk of deportation. Trump chose finding dory as his first white house screening, drawing criticism from the movie's voice stars, who found it ironic that he picked a movie about tolerance, the telegraph reports. \" odd that trump is watching finding dory today, a movie about reuniting with family when he's preventing it in real life, \" tweeted albert brooks, who voiced nemo's father, marlin. In britain, a petition to cancel a planned trump visit received almost a million signatures, though a government source told the bbc that it was considered a \" populist gesture \" and would not affect the state visit.

        "summary": "A group of 24 doctors from seven countries just reclassified a certain type of thyroid tumor as no longer cancerous, according to a report in jama oncology. That might not seem like that big of a big deal, but it is. The tumor — formerly called efvptc ( encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma ) but now known as niftp ( noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features ), with no c on the end to designate \" carcinoma \" — is estimated to make up between 10 % and 20 % of all thyroid cancer diagnoses in northern america and europe, according to a press release. The new york times reports around 10,000 people are diagnosed with it in the us annually. All those people were diagnosed with cancer, which is terrifying psychologically for a patient, and also leads to aggressive, risky — and now officially unnecessary — treatments, such as the removal of the thyroid and radioactive iodine treatments. Before making the reclassification, the international team of doctors observed more than 200 niftp patients for up to 26 years. They determined their tumors \" have a very low risk of adverse outcome. \" niftp tumors have a nucleus that looks like cancer, but those cells aren't able to get out of the fibrous tissue that encapsulates them. \" if it's not a cancer, let's not call it a cancer, \" the president-elect of the american thyroid association tells the times. Similar efforts to reclassify certain lung, prostate, and breast lesions to avoid over-diagnosing cancer are being called for. \" to my knowledge, this is the first time in the modern era a type of cancer is being reclassified as a non-cancer, \" senior investigator dr.

Though trump originally told the washington examiner's salena zito that had jackson \" been a little bit later you wouldn't have had the civil war \" ( seemingly demonstrating his understanding that jackson's term/life preceded the war ), a subsequent comment that jackson \" saw what was happening with regard to the civil war \" led to a backlash, with many pointing out jackson's 1845 death occurred 16 years before the war's start. Trump's tweet doubled-down on his claim, but also clarified his understanding of the timeline: \" president andrew jackson, who died 16 years before the civil war started, saw it coming and was angry. Would never have let it happen! \" the hill points out that trump in march likened his campaign to jackson's, telling a nashville crowd he \" confronted and defied an arrogant elite. Does that sound familiar? \" also familiar: late-night hosts lapping up the controversy. Stephen colbert suggested there was some credence to the idea jackson could have averted the war, and pictured jackson saying, \" we don't need a civil war, all my slaves are perfectly happy. \" seth meyers picked up on trump's comment that people don't ask why the war happened, picturing this battlefield letter: \" dearest elizabeth,...

But now cnn and others say democrat terry mcauliffe will reclaim the governor's seat for the party with a victory over republican attorney general ken cuccinelli. With nearly all returns in, mcauliffe had a scant lead of less than 3 percentage points. Politico sees this one as a national bellwether, given how mcauliffe, who has close ties to the clintons, portrayed cuccinelli as an \" ideological extremist. \" he also seemed to gain further advantage during the shutdown. At the same time, cuccinelli and allies such as marco rubio tried to link mcauliffe to obamacare, notes the richmond times dispatch. It wasn't enough, though, and mcauliffe got personal appearances late in the campaign from president obama, joe biden, and both bill and hillary clinton. ( also of note, the times dispatch made the rare move of not endorsing a candidate in the race; it found all three, including the libertarian in the race, to be unqualified. Mcauliffe, it said, epitomized the worst of \" crony capitalism. \" )",

A declaration from the cuban parliament today declared solidarity with \"those who're facing the brutal violation of their human rights \" at the hands of \"a law of deep racist and xenophobic nature, \" according to the cuban news agency. Lawmakers argue that the law persecutes legal immigrants too, since it demands they carry documentation ( something, the ap notes, cubans are required to carry wherever they go ). The declaration also complains that while the us is trying to turn away \"immigrants from the territories stolen by force from the noble mexican people, \" it still upholds the cuban adjustment act, which creates a legal migration framework for cuban refugees — or, as the cubans put it, encourages \"disorganized migration and desertion, which has claimed the lives of hundreds of cubans. \"",

Alabama courts got involved when the birth mother tried to prevent her ex from visits with the children; the alabama supreme court sided with the birth mother in refusing to recognize the other woman as a parent and declaring the adoption invalid under georgia law. But the high court ruled that \" the alabama supreme court erred in refusing to grant that judgment full faith and credit. \" other rulings handed down monday: the court reversed the 2002 murder conviction of louisiana death row inmate michael wearry, who was convicted in the 1998 death of a 16-year-old pizza delivery driver near baton rouge. The justices said that prosecutors should have turned over evidence casting doubt on the credibility of a prison informant and another witness who testified against wearry. The court also said the state failed to disclose medical records raising questions about a witness'description of the crime. The court rejected an appeal from apple inc. And left in place a ruling that the company conspired with publishers to raise electronic book prices when it sought to challenge amazon's dominance.

The 2-1 ruling by the new york-based appeals court had sustained a trial judge's finding that apple orchestrated an illegal conspiracy to raise prices. Meanwhile, the supreme court is staying out of a copyright dispute involving mark towle, a californian who produced replicas of the batmobile for car-collecting fans. The justices let stand a lower-court ruling that said the batmobile's bat-like appearance and high-tech gadgets make it a character that can't be duplicated without permission from dc comics, the copyright holder.

The 17-year-old, identified as jdk, alleges in court documents that her parents struggled with substance abuse when she was growing up, leaving her to care for herself, and began physically and verbally abusing her when she came out as gay at 13, reports nbc news. Jdk eventually moved in with her grandmother — part of a \" network of other adults who supplied some of the care and nurturing that her biological parents were unable to offer \" — before getting a place of her own two and a half years ago, according to the filing. She then drew up an emancipation statement and essentially cut ties. Jdk then began seeking gender transition care. Soon after, anmarie calgaro sued — to regain parental control, and to stop two health-care providers from offering transition services to jdk, whom she still refers to as her son. Calgaro's lawyer said thursday that jdk was \" a pawn in someone else's agenda, influenced by those who have no right to make decisions over [ her ] life, \" per courthouse news. But jdk says she was \" not pressured in any way \" in regards to treatment or her decision not to involve her mother. Calgaro is now racing to have her \" full parental rights \" restored before jdk's 18th birthday in july. Defense lawyers say jdk — who is set to graduate high school, has a full-time job, and has been accepted to nursing school — is clearly an emancipated minor. Calgaro says \" legal emancipation \" was never approved by a court. ( more on the case here. )",

There's also buzz that it's after a bigger fish: opera. Shares of the norwegian company, which makes a popular mobile web browser, surged today on that speculation, rttnews reports. The face.com move is being widely applauded by pundits. Techcrunch calls it a \" natural acquisition target \" because \" photos are core to facebook's lock-in strategy. \" tom cheredar of venture beat agrees, noting that the \" vast majority \" of facebook's photos have \" lots of faces \" and that it would get \" a pretty wonderful domain name \" to boot. The opera rumor hasn't gone over as well. \" buying opera will likely be another stupid acquisition \" like instagram, a global equities research note told investors today, according to pc mag. \" opera will narrow facebook's ecosystem and not broaden it, which facebook desperately needs right now. \"",

        "summary": "A man named luis lang in south carolina is emerging as the face of a new debate about obamacare. As a story by ann doss helms of the charlotte observer explains, lang is a 49-year-old self-employed handyman who has long shunned health insurance and paid his own medical bills. But now he's going blind and can't cover the bills needed to save his vision. Lang, a republican, knew obama's affordable care act required him to get coverage but chose not to do so. He tried to sign up once he got sick but missed the enrollment period. His wife now refers to it as the \" not fair health care act. \" because south carolina opted out of the act's medicaid expansion, he can't get help on that front, leaving a gofundme page as his best hope. Finally, lang is a smoker who admits he's been lax in controlling his diabetes. As helms writes: \" anyone who's remotely familiar with insurance knows there's no system that lets people skip payments while they're healthy and cash in when they get sick. \" lang is now taking flak, especially on the left, for blaming obamacare for his predicament. Some reaction: john marshall, talking points memo: \" i always try to remind myself not to criticize with stories like ( this one ), or perhaps better to say, not to forget the core reason for providing a comprehensive national plan to provide health insurance for everyone who needs it. But this story really puts that sentiment to the test, as well as exposing the perverse politics and perceptions on this issue in republican-run states. \" jay bookman, atlanta journal constitution: \" in short, the health-care problem would be a lot easier to solve if it wasn't complicated by the fact that it involves human beings, or if human beings were actually the rational beings that economic theory likes to pretend we are. \" michael hiltzik, los angeles times: \" the most pathetic part of this story may be that while the langs bear total personal responsibility for their predicament, they're still blaming obama and the democrats.

According to jalopnik, house originally said he was distracted by a \" low-flying pelican \" before later claiming he was reaching for his cellphone when he crashed. Ktre reports house had insured the bugatti for $ 2.2 million prior to sinking it in the lagoon, and received an insurance settlement of $ 600,000.

Evidence later showed in court proved he purposefully drove the bugatti into gulf bay, according to jalopnik. And the chronicle reports house pleaded guilty to insurance fraud. According to jalopnik, house \" got off surprisingly easy, \" as he had faced up to 20 years in prison for the crime. However, he's got to pay back that settlement.

The clinton campaign has claimed the emails were leaked to help donald trump. The washington post spoke to sanders, who called the leak, and trump's past praise of putin, an \" issue of concern. \" reuters spoke to intelligence sources who say the dnc hack might not be motivated by dislike of clinton or a desire to help trump, but by putin's desire to push back against what he sees as \" encirclement \" by the west.

The programs have the ability to \"reach roughly 75 % of all u.s.

That use digital telephony. Back in 2006 when it was discovered that the nsa had installed equipment at an at&t facility in san francisco, it became widely suspected that the nsa was directly, or indirectly, being fed huge amounts of raw internet data. The above programs confirm that fact. The journal goes on to explain the process by which the nsa collects information: it commands isps to send it \"various stream internet traffic it believes most likely to contain foreign intelligence. \" following, the agency makes a copy of the information, and then runs searches on it, perhaps using an email",

The system has the capacity to reach roughly 75 % of all u.s. Internet traffic in the hunt for foreign intelligence, including a wide array of communications by foreigners and americans. In some cases, it retains the written content of emails sent between citizens within the u.s. And also filters domestic phone calls made with internet technology, these people say.

The nsa's filtering, carried out with telecom companies, is designed to look for communications that either originate or end abroad, or are entirely foreign but happen to be passing through the u.s.

Internet traffic, \" according to the journal, \"including a wide array of communications by foreigners and americans. \" that content includes the writing of emails – not merely their metadata – and touches phone calls placed inside the u.s. That use digital telephony. Back in 2006 when it was discovered that the nsa had installed equipment at an at&t facility in san francisco, it became widely suspected that the nsa was directly, or indirectly, being fed huge amounts of raw internet data. The above programs confirm that fact. The journal goes on to explain the process by which the nsa collects information: it commands isps to send it \"various stream internet traffic it believes most likely to contain foreign intelligence. \" following, the agency makes a copy of the information, and then runs searches on it, perhaps using an email",
            "Washington — the national security agency — which possesses only limited legal authority to spy on u.s. Citizens — has built a surveillance network that covers more americans ' internet communications than officials have publicly disclosed, current and former officials say. The system has the capacity to reach roughly 75 % of all u.s. Internet traffic in the hunt for foreign intelligence, including a wide array of communications by foreigners and americans. In some cases, it retains the written content of emails sent between citizens within the u.s. And also filters domestic phone calls made with internet technology, these people say. The nsa's surveillance network covers more americans ' internet communications than officials have publicly disclosed, reaching roughly 75 percent of all u.s. Internet traffic. Siobhan gorman reports on the news hub. Photo: getty images. The nsa's filtering, carried out with telecom companies, is designed to look for communications that either originate or end abroad, or are entirely foreign but happen to be passing through the u.s.

Quartz reports the soup giant has become the sole investor — to the tune of $ 32 million — in meal delivery startup habit. When habit launches next year, it will send customers a blood-testing kit to use at home. It will then use customers ' genetic data from their blood sample — along with their weight, height, waist circumference, and more — to craft meals tailored to each customer's specific dietary needs. Fortune calls it a \" futuristic-sounding approach \" to food. But it's an approach that fits with current us dietary recommendations, which acknowledge that a healthy diet for one person isn't necessarily a healthy diet for another. Habit was founded by neil grimmer, whose prior venture, baby food company plum organics, was bought by campbell's for $ 249 million in 2013, the philadelphia business journal reports. In a blog post, grimmer says habit is offering an \" owner's manual for your body. \" after running tests on himself to discover his body's particulars — metabolizes caffeine slowly, stores fat, etc. — grimmer adjusted his diet and says he lost weight, got healthier, and had more energy. \" it wasn't some magic cure or quack diet, it was via a highly personalized method that made sense, \" he says. In addition to personalized meals delivered to customers'doors, habit will also offer \" coaches \" to help customers reach their health goals.

I ' m not talking about sending peas and carrots skittering off a plate, it's the lifelong practice of tweaking what i eat to get the most from what i put in my body. Over time, how i've hacked my food has changed. In my teens and 20s i was a punk rock musician into animal rights. Food was politics for me, and so i became a vegan. In my early 30s i was focused on pushing my body to its limits as a triathlete. Food was performance, and so i started to explore how nutrition could turn the dials on enduring 12-hour races. During this period of my life i helped start and ran one of the fastest growing organic food companies in the nation, plum organics. Food defined my career as my 30s pushed into my 40s, and in that context, food moved unquestionably into the center of my life. Running an organic baby food company was business, politics, nutrition, and a mission all combined. We were changing how little ones ate, and with our b-corp leanings, championing the idea that a company could do good business while doing good in the world.

        "summary": "If the 1990 miniseries based on stephen king's it didn't convince you to stay well away from storm drains and red balloons, andy muschietti's latest telling of the tale just might. It — part one of two, to be released at a later date — follows a group of kids in derry, maine, who encounter an entity that transforms into their worst fears. One such incarnation: a terrifying clown. The movie currently has a strong 90 % positive rating at rotten tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: menace clown pennywise is \" definitely scarier \" than freddy krueger, but his \" terrors can feel cartoony, \" ryan porter writes at the toronto star. No matter, the film's young actors, including finn wolfhard of netflix's stranger things, \" pull off the unlikely feat of stealing it from it. \" they deliver \" a lot of heart \" so that the film \" strikes a nice balance between sleepover-ready gross-outs … and tender coming-of-age storytelling, \" porter writes. While the film \" is no modern classic, \" it \" works enough of the time to deliver on the promise of bad dreams, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. You can thank bill skarsgard's \" spectacularly scary \" turn as pennywise for that. Referring to one violent scene involving the clown, travers adds, \" you ' ll scream bloody murder. \" and isn't that the point? yes, \" pennywise is as creepy as ever, \" but that does not a good film make. That's the take of lindsey bahr at the ap, who was disappointed overall. The film has good acting and \" a few guaranteed jump-out-of-your-seat moments, \" but \" the story is an unforgivable mess, \" and the parents and bullies are almost as cruel as the clown, which \" makes it especially hard to connect or engage with the tormented kids. \" karen d'souza, however, is more of a fan. \" the remake may not be quite as memorable as the original \" but it will send \" shivers up your spine, \" she writes at the san jose mercury news. The young actors provide \" a sense of humanity that elevates the horror, \" she adds. Speaking of horror, skarsgard gives pennywise \" a sense of intellectual depth that's disturbing. He's not just a monster, he's also smart and that's infinitely more ominous. \"",

An analysis of 40 years of sexual data from more than 33,000 americans projects that millennials — those born between 1982 and 1999 — will have sex with about eight different partners in their lifetime, behind gen xers with 10, and baby boomers with 12, reports mashable. \" the big conclusion: even though millennials are more the most sexually tolerant generation, the number of people they have sex with does not match a free love mentality — at least in the most black-and-white view, \" writes emily shire at the daily beast.

After all, the study shows that they're more likely to have had \" casual sex \" ( 38 % ) than earlier generations ( 25 % ), leading a co-author to suggest the need for more research into the dynamic: \" is it an ongoing sexual relationship with a non-romantic partner versus going to a bar and picking someone up? we need a more fine-grain distinction. \" one theory being floated for the lower partner figure among millennials: thanks to sex ed and the internet, they're generally more aware of the dangers of stis than previous generations, reports the washington post.

        "summary": "A new study tallying the african elephant population has made a stark finding: if poaching continues at its current rate, the animal may be extinct in a century, the bbc reports. \" we are shredding the fabric of elephant society and exterminating populations across the continent, \" says the study's lead author. Essentially, poachers are killing elephants faster than new births can keep up. That's because about 2 pounds of ivory from their tusks is worth thousands of dollars on the black market, and it's in high demand among china's growing middle class; they use it for trophies, medicine, and food, adds the smithsonian. The numbers are shocking: poachers killed 100,000 elephants in africa from 2010 to 2012; illegal deaths now comprise 65 % of the total population loss. Roughly 400,000 elephants are believed to remain in africa, the ap reports. Counting live elephants and poaching deaths is difficult, and the new numbers aren't exact. They are based on a combination of population and death counts from a number of localized elephant monitoring programs; those numbers were expanded to the population at large using statistical analysis, smithsonian explains. The numbers aren't terrible across the entire continent: the highest rates are in central and east africa, while populations are doing well in botswana. This bright spot gives researchers hope for the future — some think elephants can survive another poaching spike like they did in the 1970s and ' 80s. \" i have to be an optimist. I've been through all of this before … i believe we can do it again, \" says the founder of one conservation group. ( people are also eating the scaly anteater into extinction. )",

A cdc study says that us employers lost $ 77 billion in 2010 thanks to workers ' impaired productivity due to excessive alcohol abuse — a number that jumps to almost $ 90 billion once other drinking-induced factors such as absenteeism are pulled into the mix, bloomberg reports. And the study came up with an even more dire number for alcohol abuse's effect on the us economy overall that same year: $ 249 billion, a number that includes not only the lost-productivity toll, but also spending on health care, crime, car crashes, and alcohol-caused deaths. That headache seems to be getting worse. Back in 2006, the same cost to the us economy was $ 224 billion, outpacing inflation, per bloomberg. \" the increase in the costs of excessive drinking from 2006 to 2010 is concerning, particularly given the severe economic recession that occurred during these years, \" says robert brewer, one of the study's authors, in the cdc release. \" effective prevention strategies can reduce excessive drinking and related costs in states and communities, but they are under used. \" to see how much your particular drinking habit contributes to the total cost, the washington post has a pull-down menu in its story.

        "summary": "Last year, 35,092 people died in car crashes, according to numbers released monday by the national highway traffic safety administration. Npr reports it was a 7.2 % increase over 2014 — the largest single-year increase since 1966 and, according to a press release, the end of a 50-year downward trend in traffic fatalities. \" despite decades of safety improvements, far too many people are killed on our nation's roads every year, \" us transportation secretary anthony foxx says. Officials say the increase in deaths is attributable to more people driving due, in part, to job growth and cheaper gas, both of which lead to more young people driving and more people driving for non-work reasons. People are also driving longer distances, on average. Nearly half the traffic fatalities in 2015 were passengers who weren't wearing seat belts. And approximately 30 % involved a drunk driver. \" the data tell us that people die when they drive drunk, distracted, or drowsy, or if they are speeding or unbuckled, \" a nhtsa administrator says. The new numbers led the obama administration to issue a \" call to action, \" asking everyone from drivers to scientists to work together to solve the problem, the ap reports. Car-crash deaths are up 9 % so far in 2016.",

They might include, for example, armed quadcopters that can search for and eliminate people meeting certain pre-defined criteria, but do not include cruise missiles or remotely piloted drones for which humans make all targeting decisions. Artificial intelligence ( ai ) technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is — practically if not legally — feasible within years, not decades, and the stakes are high: autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms. Many arguments have been made for and against autonomous weapons, for example that replacing human soldiers by machines is good by reducing casualties for the owner but bad by thereby lowering the threshold for going to battle. The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global ai arms race or to prevent it from starting. If any major military power pushes ahead with ai weapon development, a global",

When 57-year-old debbie lopez was putting out a cigarette and steered her pickup truck off a cliff on the winding coastal highway 1 near ragged point, calif., last saturday, she plunged 150 feet and landed upside down, where she waited for help for days, reports calcoastnews.com. \" the truck just flew over and i could just feel myself flying down and hitting things i don't know what i hit, and when i landed, i didn't know i was upside down, \" she tells ksby news. On monday, she recovered enough strength to climb out through her windshield. Steep as it was, she then realized the only way out was up. So she spent 24 hours working her way upward, sometimes crawling, knowing it was the only way back to her family. She made it to the top on tuesday around 5pm, and credits her survival in part to the rainwater that collected in her wheel well and to prayer — she prayed the rosary more than a dozen times a day, the san luis obispo tribune reports. \" i got up and for a moment there were no cars and i leaned down and i kissed the road, and i said that i am going home. \" the tribune reports she was hospitalized with dehydration and is expected to head home today. One incredible detail: though police now know the location of her truck, it had fallen so far that as of wednesday night they still had trouble seeing it.

The vatican rep says friedkin may have confused the vatican with a catholic diocese or other group.

Indeed, the courier mail last month cited research that has found a \" growing proportion \" of mesothelioma sufferers were exposed in the home, not on the job.
