Many of his critics would agree, using the conventional wisdom that sex offenders can't be rehabilitated. But at salon, irin carmon makes the case that conventional wisdom is wrong in this instance: \" juvenile sex offenders often can and do get better, \" she writes. Carmon talks to medical experts on the subject and finds that consensus has shifted dramatically. \" we've done a complete about-face, \" says one at johns hopkins. Hold teens accountable, of course, but also acknowledge that their brains, specifically their ability to suss out the long-term consequences of their actions, haven't fully developed. This matters, writes carmon, \" because the main reason researchers argue that juveniles found guilty of sex crimes don't belong on the sex offender list is the copious evidence that they're susceptible to treatment — and are unlikely to reoffend. \" it also raises the hope that if rehabilitation after a crime is possible, so is better prevention in the first place.

Then, on june 3, megan oxendine, 28, a woman who had been interviewed on tv about the disappearance of jones, was found dead behind a house around 500 feet away from where the first two bodies were found. Police haven't disclosed how the three women died, and they say they don't know if there is a connection between them and patterson, who told her family she would be back in an hour. \" when she didn't come home after an hour, i called her cell phone and it went straight to voicemail, \" says patterson's mother, samantha lovette. \" we just want her home, \" she says. Lumberton police spokesman terry carter tells wncn that they are \" 99 % sure \" patterson's disappearance is not related to the deaths, but there is \" always a possibility. \" police say they are \" still talking \" to the young man last seen with patterson, who lived in florida and was visiting her family when she disappeared.",

Actually, it's an old case being given new life, seeking potential illegal activities tied to the clinton foundation while hillary clinton was secretary of state. The hill first reported thursday on the reinvigorated inquiry, with a witness and law enforcement sources saying that fbi agents have been poking around in little rock, ark., where the foundation was established, and conducted at least one interview ( the new york times notes several apparent interviews with \" people connected to the foundation \" ). The officials say the probe will look into whether there was any pay-to-play action going on during clinton's state dept. Tenure ( between 2009 and 2013 ) in the obama administration, as well as whether all tax laws were adhered to. The foundation has been under the microscope before, but that probe fizzled out in 2016, per the washington post. \" time after time these [ politically motivated ] allegations have been proven false, \" a foundation rep tells the hill. Meanwhile, officials note the doj is also re-examining whether there was more to the clinton email server that hadn't been thoroughly wrapped up before that case was closed. The daily beast reported thursday that a source said to be an ally of ag jeff sessions detailed a new effort on the emails front that includes finding more out about the classified correspondence allegedly sent via clinton's server, as well as who knew about the info there. Newsweek notes president trump has spoken in the past about diving deeper into clinton's emails, though it adds it's unclear if the doj's actions are linked to his demands. Nick merrill, hillary clinton's spokesman, calls the new looks at clinton a \" sham \" and points the finger at sessions for \" doing trump's bidding by heeding his calls to meddle with a department that is supposed to function independently. \"",

A new study out of australia looks at how we shed pounds and the \" surprising ignorance \" around the process. Contrary to commonly assumed mechanisms — that excess fat is converted to heat or energy, which \" violates the law of conservation of mass, \" per the study — most of our lost mass is breathed out as carbon dioxide, says meerman; he's the lead author of the study, published yesterday in the british medical journal. How the researchers ' \" novel calculations \" take shape: they write that losing 10 kilograms of fat ( that's 22 pounds ) requires 29 kilograms of oxygen to be inhaled; that in turn produces 28 kilograms of carbon dioxide and 11 kilograms of water. \" this tells us the metabolic fate of fat but remains silent about the proportions of the mass stored in those 10 kg of fat that depart as carbon dioxide or water during weight loss, \" they write. So they set to work tracing how every atom exits the body, and determined that the majority of the fat — 8.4 kilograms — departs via exhalation. The remaining 1.6 kilograms become water, and leave the body via a variety ways: urine, feces, sweat, tears, etc. The researchers note that the biochemistry behind their findings isn't new ( their study cites research from 1949 ), but \" it seems nobody has thought of performing these calculations before, \" they say per a press release. The million-dollar question: can we lose weight by just breathing, well, more? nope. That's a ticket to hyperventilation, not weight loss, they say.

It goes into thin air, \" says the study's lead author, ruben meerman, a physicist and australian tv science presenter. In their paper, published in the british medical journal today, the authors show that losing 10 kilograms of fat requires 29 kilograms of oxygen to be inhaled and that",
            "Widespread misconceptions about losing weight led ruben meerman and andrew brown at the university of new south wales to calculate how we \" lose weight. \" human fat cells store triglyceride, which consists of just three kinds of atoms; carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Shedding unwanted fat requires unlocking the atoms in triglyceride molecules by a process known as oxidation. By tracing every atom's pathway out of the body, the authors discovered that when 10 kg of fat are fully oxidised, 8.4 kg departs via the lungs as carbon dioxide ( co2 ). The remaining 1.6 kg becomes water ( h2o ). Their analysis shows that the inhaled oxygen required for this metabolic process weighs nearly three times more than the fat being ' lost '. To completely oxidise 10 kg of human fat, 29 kg of oxygen must be inhaled producing a total of 28 kg of carbon dioxide and 11 kg",

We encountered widespread misconceptions about how humans lose weight among general practitioners, dietitians, and personal trainers ( fig 1⇓ ). Most people believed that fat is converted to energy or heat, which violates the law of conservation of mass. We suspect this misconception is caused by the \"energy in/energy out \" mantra and the focus on energy production in university biochemistry courses. Other misconceptions were that the"

            "A three-part series assesses the global public-health toll and policy implications of drug addiction. The first paper summarises data for the prevalence and consequences of problem use of amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and opioids. In high-income countries, illicit drug use contributes less to the burden of disease than tobacco, but a substantial proportion of that burden is due to alcohol. Intelligent policy responses to drug problems need better prevalence data for different types of illicit drug use and the harms that their use causes globally. This need is especially urgent in high-income countries with substantial rates of illicit drug use and in low-income and middle-income countries close to illicit drug production areas. The second paper reviews existing drug policies and highlights the need for greater reliance on scientific evidence-based policy making. The final paper examines the value of international drug conventions in protecting public health."

Since 2011, she has tackled 51 ultra races, deadspin reports, winning 11 of them and being the first woman across the finish line in 27. Her ability, the times writes, demonstrates that \"ultrarunning is one of the few sports in which women appear able to hold their own against men. \" evolutionary biologist heather heying concedes that men are, for the most part, stronger and faster. But, she says, ultrarunning is about stamina. \"it begs the question, \" she says, \"is there something going on for women … that gives us a psychological edge in extremely long-term endurance events? \" martin hoffman, an ultrarunner and former researcher for the western states 100-mile race, chalks up dauwalter's success to the fact that few people participate in 200-mile races. \"if you have the best trained male and female ultrarunners competing against each other, the men will always win, \" he tells the times. Research on 200-mile races, however, is too sparse to draw any conclusions, heying says, adding that mental strength and pain tolerance are important equalizers. They seem to be for dauwalter. \"i put myself in situations where suffering is going to be involved and hope to be able to tap into the mental piece every time that physical pain becomes too much, \" she says.

        "summary": "A georgia teacher who spent her career helping students continued to do so even in death. Tammy waddell's final request as she suffered a long illness culminating in her june 9 death was for attendees at her funeral to bring backpacks stuffed with school supplies to help needy children. Per ajc, that's exactly what happened, making the june 12 event a bittersweet one as friends and loved ones marked the 58-year-old's passing. Photos from the funeral show dozens of mourners lined up outside a church, backpacks in hand. Another shot shows the inside of the church, where the bundles lined the pews. Waddell's cousin, dr.

A former staffer believes the charity wants \" to show warriors a good time, \" but there's no follow up, per cbs. \" it just makes me sick, \" adds millette.

Lisa leake and vani hari have as of this writing gathered more than 148,000 signatures on a change.org petition asking kraft to stop using food dyes in the product, giving us customers the same dye-free mac &amp; cheese already sold in europe, usa today reports. European food safety laws generally forbid or discourage yellow #5 and yellow #6, so kraft has devised a version without them that looks and tastes nearly identical. Food dyes are used in a host of american groceries, but leake and hari say studies have linked them to hyperactivity, allergies, and learning disabilities in kids, and shown that yellow #5 and #6 in particular can cause cancer. But kraft points out that the fda has approved the ingredients; the company says safety and quality are \" our highest priority. \" leake's reply: \" if they say safety is their highest priority, why still use a questionable ingredient that has a warning label when used in europe? \"",

        "summary": "At least as of friday, the us-north korea summit meeting is back on — but who's going to foot the bill? especially that darned hotel bill. So the washington post is asking in an article about how two teams led by washington and pyongyang are hammering out details before the june 12 meeting. Two people familiar with negotiations say the us team is willing to pay for north korea's favored lodging, at the five-star fullerton hotel near the singapore river, where the presidential suite alone costs over $ 6,000 a night. But knowing that cash-strapped north korea may be insulted by a us payment, americans are asking singapore to pay for it. Yet such payments are nothing new: north korean athletes and cheerleaders had their travel costs covered to the 2018 olympics in pyeongchang ( by the international olympic committee and south korea, respectively ) and when former us director of national intelligence james clapper dined in north korea to take back two us prisoners in 2014, he was served an elaborate meal and asked to pay the bill. One issue now is that paying for north korea's hotel bill would violate treasury department sanctions; the us could seek waivers, but a detailed exemption list might raise eyebrows. On the bright side, the fullerton does accept cancellations 48 hours ahead of time and the wifi is free for guests, the new york post reports.",

Renate langer says the director raped her in february 1972 when she was 15 years old. The 61-year-old former actress says she was visiting polanski, who she met while working at a modeling agency in high school in germany, in switzerland because he was thinking about casting her in a film. She says she tried to defend herself when he raped her at his home. Langer says she didn't tell police, friends, or family because she was worried about her parents. \" my mother would have had a heart attack, \" she says. \" i felt ashamed and embarrassed and lost. \" she says polanski called and apologized a month later, offering her a small role. But while filming in rome, langer says he raped her again despite her throwing bottles of wine and perfume at him. Swiss police interviewed langer about the allegations last month, afp reports. While switzerland has no statute of limitations on child sex abuse, a spokesperson says it's unclear at this moment if charges will be filed against the 84-year-old polanski. Langer says she decided to come forward after another woman did so in august and now that both her parents are dead ( her father died over the summer ). A woman named only as robin m. Said in august that polanski \" sexually victimized \" her in 1973 when she was 16, according to salon. In 2010, actor charlotte lewis said polanski sexually assaulted her in the 1980s when she also was 16. Polanski fled the us in 1978 after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl.",

But it seems too much fluoride can do a lot of damage. Not only can it actually damage our teeth and weaken our bones — studies in china and iran appear to link excessive fluoride to a seven-point reduction in children's iqs, scientific american reports. Those studies may not control for other health risks, but they could signal a problem — one which is particularly worrying in states like maine. Much of the state gets its drinking water from private wells, and that water isn't held to federal or state standards. In a voluntary study that included about a quarter of maine's towns, wells in about 10 communities were shown to contain risky amounts of fluoride — sometimes more than twice the epa's limit. Fluoride's presence is boosted by the granite under the state, which is packed with the chemical; there's plenty of granite in other new england states as well. An expert tells the portland press-herald that residents should have their water tested, but people only do it \" when they buy a house or if they get sick. \" if there's too much fluoride, reverse osmosis systems can help, but they cost between $ 1,000 and $ 2,000.

Dallas police chief david brown recited lyrics from stevie wonder's \" as, \" explaining that as a young man in the ' 70s, he used to recite song lyrics to get dates ( and when it was love, he \" had to dig down deep to get some stevie wonder to fully express the love i had \" ) — and he wanted to show some of that love to the officers ' families, the miami herald reports. \" we all know sometimes life's hate and troubles can make you wish you were born in another time and place, but you can bet your lifetimes and twice as double that god knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed, \" recited the chief, who was greeted with a long standing ovation when he rose to speak. \" so make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it, you're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called hell. Change your words into truth and then change that truth into love, \" the chief continued. He recited several more lines before introducing obama, who quipped: \" chief brown, i ' m so glad i met michelle first because she loves stevie wonder, \" mashable notes. In other coverage: the service at the meyerson symphony center also included an extraordinary performance from gospel singer gaye arbuckle. The dallas morning news describes her rendition of \" total praise \" by richard smallwood as a \" healing moment in a service that sought to heal, in whatever way it could. \" obama delivered his remarks — which can be seen in full here — next to five chairs empty but for folded american flags as tributes to the fallen officers, abc news reports. The white house says the president stayed up long into the night to write the speech himself, drawing on the bible for inspiration. The new york times reports that obama's speech was, for the most part, welcomed by law enforcement officials, as was that of george w. Bush. \" too often we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions, \" bush said to applause. \" and this has strained our bonds of understanding and common purpose. \"",

The former fbi chief's testimony begins thursday morning, and trump associates say the president is likely to be watching closely and tweeting furiously, reports the washington post, which describes the upcoming senate proceeding as a \" political super bowl. \" \" he's not going to take an attack by james comey laying down, \" says trump friend roger stone. \" trump is a fighter, he's a brawler, and he's the best counterpuncher in american politics. \" in other developments: sources tell the new york times that, in a sign of how much comey distrusted trump, he told attorney general jeff sessions that he didn't want to be left alone with the president again following a private meeting. Comey did not tell sessions, however, that trump had asked him to drop the investigation of former national security adviser michael flynn, the sources say. The hearing on alleged russian meddling in the election opens wednesday, and officials such as deputy attorney general rod rosenstein are expected to face questions about trump's firing of comey, among other issues, reports reuters. Sources tell the washington post that after a briefing in march, trump asked director of national intelligence dan coats if he could intervene with comey to have the investigation of flynn dropped. Coats, the nation's top intelligence official, discussed the request with other officials and decided it was inappropriate, the sources say. The ap reports that with comey's testimony widely expected to reveal damaging new details about trump's involvement with the russia investigation, the white house and its allies are already trying to push back. The pro-trump great america alliance group is airing an ad describing comey as a \" showboat \" who was so obsessed with the russia issue he failed to concentrate on fighting terrorism. Friends of comey tell politico that he's likely to stick to describing his interactions with trump instead of discussing the wider russia investigation with the senate panel. Special counsel robert mueller is now leading a probe into the alleged election interference, and associates say comey has already discussed his testimony with mueller. Trump has declined to use executive privilege to try to stop comey testifying. When asked about the testimony on tuesday, the president said: \" i wish him luck. \"",

The new york times today takes a look at this most unusual piece of real estate — and the unusual consequences of a common problem: homes that buyers intended to flip and, more than five years later, still find themselves stuck with. Susan and manfred phemister had done a few flips before buying the albany-area castle ( in truth it's the 119-year-old amsterdam armory, though it does have two turrets ) for $ 800,000 in 2005. Their plan: sink $ 400,000 into renovations and list it for $ 2 million in 2007. \" then we'd sell and make the extra million we'd need to buy a brownstone, \" says susan. You can predict where the story goes from here: the home has been relisted a handful of times, with the price sinking ever lower. Now, just $ 24-a-square-foot will get you, per sotheby's, a massive gymnasium, two kitchens, and staff quarters. The times looks into how the phemisters are managing in the meantime: a second downturn, in the music industry, hurt manfred's cd music distribution business; to keep their income up they've rented the castle to tv and film crews and now operate a bed-and-breakfast out of it. That helped to pay the not-insignificant $ 13,076 utility bill last year. And for now, they ' ll keep paying it. \" we love living here, \" says susan. \" it's just that it's someone else's turn to live in a castle. \"",

I really believe it, \" he told a rally in altoona friday night, per the guardian. \" we have to call up law enforcement, and we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching, \" trump said, expressing dismay at the state's lack of voter id requirements and urging his supporters to \" go around and look and watch other polling places \" after they have cast their votes in november. A round-up of coverage: wendy weiser, director of the democracy program at the new york university school of law's brennan center for justice, tells the los angeles times that trump's \" disturbing and harmful \" remarks could lead to the intimidation of minority voters. Pennsylvania is a must-win state for trump, but he is 11 points behind clinton, according to the latest marist poll. Analysts say that while trump is doing well with the state's working-class white voters, there aren't enough of them for him to win the state unless there is a massive shift away from clinton in the philadelphia suburbs, the new york times reports. Buzzfeed reports that trump has added a new page to his website seeking \" volunteer trump election observers \" to help him stop \" crooked hillary \" from \" rigging this election. \" philip bump at the washington post looks at problems that have occured in recent pennsylvania elections, and finds there is little to warrant what he calls trump's call for voter intimidation — which could be a \" recipe for tension, if not violence. \" politico reports that earlier on friday, trump said his claim that president obama is the founder of isis was \" sarcasm, \" then told a rally in erie, pa.

        "summary": "The democrats have, somewhat belatedly, spotted two huge problems with hillary clinton's campaign, the new york times reports. One was her status as a washington insider with strong links to wall street, and the other related problem was a failure to connect with the white working class that helped send her husband to the white house twice. Insiders say that she turned down an invitation to a university of notre dame st. Patrick's day gathering because her campaign didn't think it was important to reach out to white catholics — and despite bill clinton's urging, the campaign decided to target college-educated suburban voters instead of trying to cut into trump's lead among whites without college degrees. Strategists say the clinton campaign blundered by expecting young minority voters to turn out for her in the same numbers that they did for obama. Her standing with working-class white voters fell even further after her \" basket of deplorables \" comment. An insider tells the times that after the remark, she told an aide she knew she had \" just stepped in it. \" in a look at the national exit poll, the washington post reports that the expected surge of female voters and latino voters that might have saved clinton did not materialize. The poll also shows that trump won white voters by a record 21-point margin, 58 % to 37 %. The previous record was 20 points, set by ronald reagan in 1984 and repeated by mitt romney in 2012.

As one person involved puts it to the bbc, \" we actually helped free an innocent man. \" kaj linna had served 11 years of a life sentence for murder and robbery in sweden when true-crime podcast spar drew attention to his case in may 2015. Over eight episodes, journalists anton berg and martin johnson told how robert lindberg had been killed and his brother injured in an attack on a farm and how the brother had thought the attacker might've been a former business associate. The associate had an alibi, however, and he suggested linna as a suspect instead. He steered police to a third man, who became the main witness in linna's trial and claimed that linna had planned to rob the lindbergs, per the local. Linna was found guilty and imprisoned for the crime in 2004. Of particular importance, however, was an interview the main witness gave to spar years later. After asking that his microphone be turned off, \" he came up with a different story to the one he put forward in the trial, \" berg says. He adds that the main microphone had indeed been turned off, but a secondary one inadvertently recorded everything the witness said. Linna used the audio during an appeal and was granted a retrial in december. On thursday, the swedish court of appeal acquitted him, citing \" insufficient \" evidence for conviction. Berg says the podcast team is \" happy and relieved \" and \" frankly impressed that a podcast could have this kind of impact. \" linna is expected to receive a major payout.",

Oregon's bill was signed into law last week and california's, passed two years ago, is being fine-tuned into regulations by state officials, usa today reports. The laws also allow pharmacists to dispense other hormonal contraceptives without a prescription. Women's health advocates applauded the move: \" we were pleased to hear from several male legislators who testified that they deferred to their wives in seeking guidance on their vote, \" says an official at planned parenthood advocates of oregon, per the oregonian. \" [ it shows why ] birth control decisions should stay between a woman and her doctor, not politicians. \" another beneficiary is physicians burdened by long lines of patients, like americans now insured by obamacare and baby boomers getting medicare as they turn 65, npr reports. But it's no quickie trip to the drug store: pharmacists will still have to give women health screenings before dispensing the contraception. The laws — which should kick in by october 1 in california and after new year's in oregon — arrive as the us congress is debating birth-control access. Both parties agree to the no-prescription idea, but republicans don't want insurers footing the bill. Democrats say that would keep many women in poverty from getting birth control.

Severe year? it may seem that way, explains ap, because this year's flu started early and is unusually rough on those who get it. Plus, last year was a mild one for comparison's sake. But we probably won't know until spring how this year's sickness stacks up. \" bottom line: it's flu season, \" says the cdc chief.

Oral microbes may be transferred from parents to infants via pacifiers. We investigated whether pacifier cleaning practices affected the risk of allergy development. Methods: a birth-cohort of 184 infants was examined for clinical allergy and sensitization to airborne and food allergens at 18 and 36 months of age and, in addition, promptly on occurrence of symptoms.

Oral microbes may be transferred from parents to infants via pacifiers. We investigated whether pacifier cleaning practices affected the risk of allergy development.

Officer ruben de los santos, a school resource officer for rolesville high school, was responding to an early morning fight between two female students in the cafeteria tuesday. The nine-second clip shows de los santos ( identified by the police department, per the washington post ) lifting up a girl in a pink shirt to about shoulder's height as a crowd of students watches, then slamming her to the ground, where she remains unmoving for a second or two until he drags her up by the arm and makes her walk away with him. The rolesville pd says it's asked the state bureau of investigation to investigate and pledges to \" work diligently to review any and all pertinent information so that we provide an accurate account of the events. \" the school's principal said in a statement that she was \" deeply concerned \" about what she witnessed. The student who filmed the video posted it on twitter and said, \" this. Is. Not okay., \" including a hashtag with the school's name. The aclu of north carolina also weighed in, tweeting, \" disturbing use of force at #rolesvillehigh that should never be used against kids in schools. \" the mother of the student, identified by wlos as 15-year-old jasmine darwin, says jasmine, an honors student, has a concussion and won't be returning to the school. Jasmine, who says she was trying to defend her sister in the original fight, tells wral, \" i was in shock. \" meanwhile, dajerria becton, the teen taken to the ground by a texas cop in 2015 during a pool party, has filed a $ 5 million suit against now ex-cop eric casebolt, the city of mckinney, and the police department, per the dallas morning news.",

Nbc philadelphia reports kate mcclure, mark d ' amico, and johnny bobbitt will face charges of conspiracy and theft by deception for allegedly concocting a false story to benefit themselves. Believing they were creating a better life for bobbitt, said to have given mcclure his last $ 20 to buy gas when she became stranded on a philadelphia highway, 14,000 people donated more than $ 400,000 to the campaign last year. Temporarily set up in a trailer on property owned by mcclure's family, bobbitt went on to sue, claiming mcclure and d ' amico were using the fund as their \" personal piggy bank. \" police raided the couple's florence, nj, home in september, seizing cash, jewelry, financial statements, and a new bmw, though bobbitt's lawyer said the donated funds were gone. Citing a source familiar with the case, nbc reports mcclure and d ' amico turned themselves in wednesday to burlington county prosecutors, who believe the three deliberately prevented campaign donors from gaining information \" that would affect their judgment about solicited contribution to that fundraising effort. \" it's not clear if bobbitt is also in custody. Per wvpi, prosecutors are to announce new developments in the case at 2pm local time thursday. ( gofundme previously promised to give bobbitt the full amount he was due. )",

Researchers say that people aged 18 to 25 who used marijuana at least once a week were found to have abnormalities in the parts of the brain linked to emotion, decision-making, and motivation, the boston globe reports. While it's not clear whether the changes are linked to decreased function, \" this is a part of the brain you do not want to mess around with, \" the lead researcher warns. The casual tokers had an average of six joints a week, and the changes appeared to be more pronounced the more that was smoked. The changes in young brains are reason to worry, the lead researcher says, because \" this is when you are making major decisions in your life, when you are choosing a major, starting a career, making long-lasting friendships and relationships. \" a neuropharmacologist not involved with the study says that while he doesn't doubt the results, he is wary of marijuana studies like this one that were funded by federal agencies tasked with limiting drug use. \" if it were my child, even with this study, i ' m more comfortable with young people having a marijuana habit than drinking regularly, \" he tells usa today.",

In a sunday string of tweets, trump blasted democrats, telling them to \" fix the laws \" while praising his own administration for being better than those of bush or obama at handing the complex issue. In that same tweet, trump connected illegal immigration with crime on this side of the border. \" cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our country. Strong borders, no crime! \" he tweeted. As politico notes, trump and his supporters have frequently used controversial language when describing undocumented immigrants, specifically when invoking the ms-13 gang. The president did not mention the street gang in sunday's tweets. However, trump did say that \" we cannot allow all of these people to invade our country... We must immediately, with no judges or court cases, bring them back from where they came. \" as of may, federal immigration courts had a backlog of over 700,000 cases and some courts were scheduling hearings after 2021.

The $ 44 million total doesn't take into account civilian aircraft or the cost of accommodating hundreds of intelligence analysts and other personnel worldwide. Add those expenses in, and the total is in the \" hundreds of millions of dollars. \" australia is leading the search and has borne about half the costs so far, though prime minister tony abbott said the nation may ask others to defray its expenses later. \" at some point, there might need to be a reckoning, there might need to be some kind of tallying, but nevertheless we are happy to be as helpful as we can to all the countries that have a stake in this, \" he said.

Craig tieszen, 68, a republican from rapid city, and his brother-in-law, brent moline, 61, died wednesday rapid city mayor steve allender wrote on his facebook page that tieszen and moline died in a kayak accident. Tieszen and his family had traveled to the cook islands for their wedding, according to allender's post. The cook islands police service didn't immediately return an email from the associated press seeking additional information. The agency wrote in a facebook post that officials had been at the scene of a \" double tragedy at sea, \" saying two men had taken their kayaks over a reef and capsized. The post doesn't name tieszen or moline, but describes the two victims as american citizens",

Wood is divorced with two sons, one a student at texas a&m university and the other an alumnus of that school. \" do you want to know how it feels to lose a son at the age of 50? \" his mother says. \" it's devastating.

The problem is that mitch mcconnell's task of getting the necessary 50 votes seems to have gotten only more difficult over the holiday break, and that's raising a slew of stories about what happens if the gop bill fails. Shoring up obamacare is one possibility, but another is the controversial idea of some kind of single-payer system. The long-shot concept, anathema to conservatives, is surfacing more and more in stories: definition: under a single-payer system, \" doctors and hospitals are mostly private entities, but are paid exclusively by the government, \" explains a primer at mother jones. \" canada is single-payer, with each province acting as the sole source of payment to doctors and hospitals. In the us, medicaid and traditional medicare are single-payer. \" tax hikes: everybody would get core coverage regardless of income, job, or health status, explains money, and people would no longer get insurance through their jobs. But paying for it would surely require new tax increases of some kind. Sanders, and others: the concept is gaining traction among democrats, reports the hill. Bernie sanders promises to introduce a bill when debate ends on the gop obamacare alternative. Sens. Elizabeth warren and kirsten gillibrand back the concept, and in the house, a \" medicare for all \" proposal by rep. John conyers has 113 co-sponsors. Warren, specifically, told the wall street journal last month that \" now it's time for the next step, and the next step is single payer. \" please, no: putting bureaucrats in charge of health care isn't the answer, writes sally pipes at forbes. \" single-payer systems have endangered lives and reduced access to quality care everywhere they've been implemented, \" she notes, citing \" deplorable care \" in britain and canada and arguing that if republicans needed any incentive to make progress on their health bill, the prospect of a single-payer system should do it. California: a bill to shift to a single-payer system stalled last month in the california assembly, and the los angeles times reports that a main reason is that it was \" short on key policy specifics — most significantly, how to pay for it. \" partisan divide: a pew research center poll finds that 52 % of democrats support the single-payer idea, but the overall percentage in support drops to 33 when republicans are added, reports cnn.

It took so long that wood's lawyers filed an emergency appeal to stop the procedure after an hour because they say their 55-year-old client was still gasping for air at that point, reports the guardian. According to the court filing cited by the la times, the lethal injection began at 1: 52pm local time. Five minutes later, the state said wood was sedated, \" but at 2: 02 he began to breathe, \" wrote the attorneys. \" at 2: 03 his mouth moved. Mr. Wood has continued to breathe since that time. He has been gasping and snorting for more than an hour. At 3: 02 p.m. At that time, staff rechecked for sedation. He is still alive. \" the execution continued, and wood was pronounced dead at 3: 49pm, one hour and 57 minutes after the procedure began. The details of what happened aren't out yet, but the case is drawing immediate parallels to the botched execution of clayton lockett in oklahoma. Wood's lawyers had tried to stop the execution from taking place, arguing that he had the right to know where the lethal drugs were coming from, but the us supreme court allowed it to proceed. Wood murdered his girlfriend and her father in 1989, and the ap quotes a relative of the victims unmoved by the idea that wood suffered any discomfort. \" this man conducted a horrific murder and you guys are going, ' let's worry about the drugs, ' \" said richard brown. \" why didn't they give him a bullet, why didn't we give him drano? \"",

As kiro tv and the skagit valley herald report, some five or six crew members employed by the yacht's builder were putting the boat into shallow waters in anacortes when it immediately began to tilt. Several attempted to adjust the ballast in the engine room of the bäden, but without success. The engine room began to flood, and one man had to be removed through a port hole that rescuers chopped out with an ax. A spokesman for yacht builder northern marine, which will have to bear the cost of the salvage, tells the herald that the ship took two and a half years to build. It's likely a lot of effort and money wasted: the 85-foot fiberglass hull is expected to be salvageable, but \" everything inside is toast — everything. Nothing's made to be submerged in salt water. \" the owner of the yacht was not identified. Maritime website gcaptain notes that the bäden was, per an engineering firm employed by the builder, \" lighter than other northern marine builds of similar length, thus requiring more ballast to sit on a desired waterline. \" the firm advised final ballasting take place at launch, but exactly why the yacht capsized is unclear. The us coast guard will investigate. ( click for another unusual story involving a yacht... And louis ck. )",

In off-the-book meetings, he's been urging us postmaster general megan brennan to hike package-delivery charges for amazon and other companies by 100 % — a change that could add billions to their bills, insiders tell the washington post. Brennan has refused, saying the deals benefit the postal service, but trump is building pressure with his twitter attacks and a government review of the contracts. Meanwhile, the postal service is still losing money ( $ 2.7 billion net loss last year, per business insider ) and borrowing from the treasury department's federal financing bank to stay afloat. But the postal service says hiking their package contracts ( which remain private ) would only help competitors. \" some of our competitors in the package delivery space would dearly love for the postal service to aggressively raise our rates higher than the marketplace can bear — so they could either charge more themselves or siphon away postal customers, \" a postal service spokesman wrote in the hill. Adding further confusion, trump's aides disagree on whether amazon is paying enough or keeping the postal service in business. And some white house officials say trump is only attacking amazon because of articles published in the post, which is owned by amazon founder jeffrey bezos.",

Zhang admitted to the federal bureau of investigation that he downloaded apple driverless technology files to his wife's laptop to have continued access to them, according to the complaint. He was arrested july 7. Xmotors has always strictly abided by the laws of china and the u.s. And takes protection of intellectual property rights seriously, isabel jiang, an xmotors spokeswoman, said in a statement. \"there is no indication that he has ever communicated any sensitive information from apple to xmotors, \" jiang said of zhang.

Researchers in the patagonia region of argentina found a brute they've named dreadnoughtus, and they're laying claim to it being the largest land animal whose size can be accurately measured — thanks mainly to the fact that they found 70 % of a skeleton. Some highlights of the study in scientific reports. Dimensions: it was 85 feet long and weighed 130,000 pounds. Dreadnoughtus had a 37-foot-long neck that enabled the plant-eater to feast without having to move around much. Also: it was still growing when it died about 77 million years ago. Context: \" to put [ the dino's 65-ton size ] in perspective, an african elephant is about five tons, t. Rex is eight tons, diplodocus is 18 tons, and a boeing 737 is around 50 tons, \" says study author kenneth lacovara of drexel university in the washington post. Demise: the big guy and a smaller companion got stuck in something akin to quicksand, which is why the bones are so well preserved. Name: dreadnoughtus means \" fear nothing. \" the full name is dreadnoughtus schrani, with \" schrani \" an homage to tech entrepreneur adam schran, who helped fund the research, notes the new york times.

        "summary": "\" the documents have circulated for months and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials who have seen them. \" so writes buzzfeed in introducing the 35-page dossier it published tuesday night that alleges russia has compromising information, both financial and personal, on president-elect donald trump. Their publication raises some big questions about journalistic ethics: why did buzzfeed decide to pull the trigger on publishing in full ( in its words ) \" unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations \"? why now? why hadn't other outlets ( mother jones did quote from it in october )? some perspective: from the horse's mouth: buzzfeed editor-in-chief ben smith in an email explains what went into the decision to publish the dossier, concluding, the move \" reflects how we see the job of reporters in 2017. \" at slate, will oremus takes a positional view. Though he says smith places buzzfeed within the mainstream media, \" he was acting here in a different tradition \": that born of the internet and blogs \" in which sensitive and embarrassing information about public figures is readily disclosed \" under a public-has-a-right-to-know rallying cry. At the atlantic, david a. Graham sees that cry as \" an abdication of the basic responsibility of journalism. \" heaping information into the public's lap is not the reporter's job, he writes. \" it is to gather information, sift through it, and determine what is true and what is not. \" here, for instance, is new york times executive editor dean baquet's explanation of its own decision: \" we, like others, investigated the allegations and haven't corroborated them, and we felt we're not in the business of publishing things we can't stand by. \" as for that corroboration, lawfare makes this point: \" this is a document about meetings that either took place or did not take place, stays in hotels that either happened or didn't, travel that either happened or did not happen. It should be possible to know whether at least some of these allegations are true or false. \" propublica president richard tofel suggests the publication an hour prior to buzzfeed's dump of a cnn story that reported trump and president obama had received a two-page summary of the reports last week, changes the game. He tweeted buzzfeed \" kudos... Once cnn story out, citizens should have evidence to consider for themselves. \" hogwash, writes margaret sullivan at the washington post. \" it's never been acceptable to publish rumor and innuendo.

        "summary": "King tut's dagger is out of this world — or at least it was at some point. Italian and egyptian researchers teamed up to analyze the blade found in the boy king's sarcophagus ( placed on his right thigh ) using portable fluorescence spectrometry. They found that the iron used to make the dagger came from a meteor, reports discovery news. ( as gizmodo puts it: \" king tut had a space dagger. \" ) \" since its discovery in 1925, the meteoritic origin of the iron dagger blade... Has been the subject of debate and previous analyses yielded controversial results, \" the researchers write in the journal meteoritics and planetary science. However, the recent analysis \" strongly supports its meteoritic origin. \" the tipoff? nickel, researcher daniela comelli tells discovery news. While many iron artifacts have a maximum of 4 % nickel, the blade of tut's dagger ( complete with a gold handle and decorated gold sheath ) contains nearly 11 %. And then there's the cobalt concentration, a slim 0.58 %. \" the nickel and cobalt ratio in the dagger blade is consistent with that of iron meteorites, \" comelli says. Researchers also think they may have identified the meteor the iron came from. Of the 20 they looked at, just one's nickel and cobalt measurements are in the ballpark. That meteor, called kharga, was discovered in 2000 on a limestone plateau about 150 miles west of alexandria. The researchers say the quality of the blade indicates that egyptians of the 14th century bc already were skilled ironsmiths. And then, a linguistic insight: the researchers note a \" composite term \" introduced one century later means \" iron of the sky, \" and \" suggests that the ancient egyptians... Were aware that these rare chunks of iron fell from the sky already... Anticipating western culture by more than two millennia. \" ( egypt has been accused of hiding the truth about tut's tomb. )",

Despite the rare existence of smelted iron, it is generally assumed that early iron objects were produced from meteoritic iron. Nevertheless, the methods of working the metal, its use, and diffusion are contentious issues compromised by lack of detailed analysis. Since its discovery in 1925, the meteoritic origin of the iron dagger blade from the sarcophagus of the ancient egyptian king tutankhamun ( 14th c. Bce ) has been the subject of debate and previous analyses yielded controversial results. We show that the composition of the blade ( fe plus 10.8 wt % ni and 0.58 wt % co ), accurately determined through portable x‐ray fluorescence spectrometry, strongly supports its meteoritic origin. In agreement with recent results of metallographic analysis of ancient iron artifacts from gerzeh, our study confirms that ancient egyptians attributed great value to meteoritic iron for the production of precious objects.

Police surrounded the apartment and ordered those inside out, threatening to use a k9 officer if needed. Police later put two people into the back of police cruisers. We are still waiting word on what they will be charged with. \" visible police presence as we've seen over the months is doing almost nothing to dissuade people from terrorizing our neighborhoods, \" said chief fred fletcher with the chattanooga police department. Police investigators later closed down west 38th street so the investigation could continue. \" it's clear that from the family i ' m talking to that the people shooting and being shot at have a particular beef with each other, \" fletcher continued.

        "summary": "Go big or go home — or, in the case of a bunch of drug smugglers nailed in what new zealand is calling its biggest drug bust ever, to the big house ( aka prison ). Per the bbc, new zealand police found 77 pounds worth of cocaine bricks — with a street value of up to $ 14 million, according to the new zealand herald — crammed into a most-unusual vessel: a sequin-adorned statue of a horse's head. The head, which the guardian describes as a \" less than inconspicuous sculpture \" that weighed nearly 900 pounds and concealed the coke bricks in the base of its neck, was intercepted by new zealand cops and customs officials after being shipped from mexico to auckland in may. \" this is a significant win for new zealand, \" a head detective says. \" we should be proud to have detected it at the earliest of stages. \" cops have already arrested two mexicans, ages 29 and 44, and a 56-year-old american and are now trying to determine if auckland was meant to be the final stop or if the horse head and its powdery cargo were supposed to go to another destination. A massey university researcher speculates the coke may have been meant for the country's east coast. The guardian notes that cocaine finding its way into new zealand is an uncommon occurrence due to meticulous border control and because it's far from most major overseas drug markets. \" what this find tells us … is that there is obviously a demand for it, \" a senior sergeant says, per a press release. \" while it's possible that this statue may have been sent on to another country … there's every possibility that the cocaine was destined for the new zealand market and we would be naive to think otherwise. \" all three suspects are facing charges of importing and possession for supply of a class a drug, which could lead to life in prison. ( colombia recently had its biggest coke bust ever. )",
