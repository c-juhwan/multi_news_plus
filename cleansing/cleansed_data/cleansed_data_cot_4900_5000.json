        "summary": "The cbc describes canuck as \" vancouver's most notorious crow, \" and it's not hard to see why: after cops in the canadian city shot and injured a man who confronted them with a knife on tuesday, a crow believed to be canuck — because of a distinctive red band on its leg and countless similar escapades in the past — took off with the weapon from the crime scene. Police say the crow picked up the knife from behind police tape and only dropped it after it had been chased for around 20 feet. The crow also tried to steal a pair of glasses and equipment belonging to a tv news crew, the vancouver courier reports. Witnesses say the suspect, who was treated for non-life-threatening gunshot wounds, set a vehicle on fire before police arrived, and canuck perched on the burnt-out car. \" the crow was persistent, but the knife was eventually gathered as evidence, \" a vancouver police officer tells the cbc. Courier reporter mike howell says in more than 20 years of reporting from crime scenes, he's never seen anything like it. A facebook page dedicated to canuck chronicles earlier incidents, including a ride on mass transit and an attack on a cyclist. In a cbc story on the bird last year, an area resident complained that the bird was known for stealing \" packs of cigarettes, rolling papers, lighters, change, keys... Pretty much anything he can get his hands on. \" ( seattle has some famous crows, too. )",

After decades of using pop music to explore and explode america's sexual taboos, the queen of clubland sounded like she wanted to spend the twilight of her reign having fun. Her new album, \"mdna, \" feels more like \"tears in a nightclub bathroom \" — a joyless collection of impersonal dance tracks spiked with very personal lyrics that ruminate on her 2008 divorce from director guy ritchie.

Her gift for writing catchy tunes that suit her unvirtuosic voice, matched to lyrics that often straddle the clichéd and the universal, has been strong enough to carry her through hits and flops, artistic moments and easy gimmicks.

            "It's been seven years since madonna released \"confessions on a dance floor, \" her last great album and what could have been a winning blueprint for the remaining chapters of her career. The beats were bubbly, the melodies were colorful and the good times were undeniable. After decades of using pop music to explore and explode america's sexual taboos, the queen of clubland sounded like she wanted to spend the twilight of her reign having fun. Her new album, \"mdna, \" feels more like \"tears in a nightclub bathroom \" — a joyless collection of impersonal dance tracks spiked with very personal lyrics that ruminate on her 2008 divorce from director guy ritchie. Madonna's music has never invited us into the gnarly nooks of her personal life, and \"mdna \" illustrates why. She's lousy at it. \"i tried to be a good girl / i tried",
            "Photo \"i ' m gonna be o.k./i don't care what people say, \" madonna sings on her new album, \"mdna. \" that may be the least necessary assurance in pop-music history. For nearly 30 years it has been a fact of popular culture that madonna perseveres, calculates, reconfigures, strives and endures. Her gift for writing catchy tunes that suit her unvirtuosic voice, matched to lyrics that often straddle the clichéd and the universal, has been strong enough to carry her through hits and flops, artistic moments and easy gimmicks. Four years after her last album, madonna, at 53, remains superstar enough to have been handed this year's super bowl halftime show. That high-tech, hollow performance started the promotional cycle for her latest release. Now that thumping dance beats are all over top 40 radio, madonna's timing is good for \"mdna \" (",

Christopher knight, better known as the north pond hermit, spent nearly 30 years living in isolation in the woods of central maine before his arrest on burglary charges last year. He's out of jail now, though living in the community again as part of his court deal, and he has granted his only interview to writer michael finkel of gq. Some excerpts: \" i had a backpack and minimal stuff, \" he said of his decision to bail from society in 1986. \" i had no plans. I had no map. I didn't know where i was going. I just walked away. \" \" i lost my identity. With no audience, no one to perform for, i was just there. There was no need to define myself; i became irrelevant. The moon was the minute hand, the seasons the hour hand. I didn't even have a name. I never felt lonely. To put it romantically: i was completely free. \" \" i suspect more damage has been done to my sanity in jail, in months; than years, decades, in the woods. \" \" i don't like what i see in the society i ' m about to enter, \" he said before his release in november. \" i don't think i ' m going to fit in. It's too loud. Too colorful. The lack of aesthetics. The crudeness. The inanities. The trivia. \" recalling how he listened to the radio at his remote, hidden camp: \" bach is too pristine, \" he said, but \" they will be playing lynyrd skynyrd songs in a thousand years. \" click to read the fascinating full piece.

Advertisement \"restricting employees to using only restrooms that are not consistent with their gender identity, or segregating them from other workers by requiring them to use gender-neutral or other specific restrooms, singles those employees out and may make them fear for their physical safety, \" the guidance says. \"bathroom restrictions can result in employees avoiding using restrooms entirely while at work, which can lead to potentially serious physical injury or illness. \" in describing best practices, osha said many companies have implemented written policies to ensure that all employees have prompt access to appropriate sanitary facilities and are given additional options, including"

        "summary": "As americans grow ever larger, clothing stores like j. Crew are offering ever smaller sizes — and the retailer insists it's due to actual demand. Just not from americans. In response to the controversy that ensued this week after the chain started offering size 000, a spokesperson explained to today, \" we are simply addressing the demand coming from asia for smaller sizes than what we had carried. \" the company isn't the first to cater to this petite population — nicole miller introduced a size 0 for a 25½-inch waist 15 years ago due to demand from asian customers in california, reports time — but it's worth noting that only those with a 23-inch waist will fit into a j. Crew 000. Something called \" vanity sizing \" may also be at play — meaning sizing goes down even while the average woman is growing larger. Today, the average american woman is 5 ' 4 \" and 155 pounds, which is 20 pounds heavier than in the 1970s, so she should be in a size 16 — but vanity sizing puts her in a 10 or 12 instead, newsweek explained a few years ago when \" subzero \" sizing first started popping up. Fashion blog racked notes that j. Crew's new ' 000 ' is the equivalent of a size 32 in italy, 1 in japan, and 0 in australia. As far as j. Crew is concerned, it's an xxxs, i.e., smaller than an xs ( size 0 ) or an xxs ( size 00 ).

And this spring, banana republic began offering an equally tiny \" 00 \" on its web site. If you're having trouble picturing a minus-size woman, think of the waifish spice girl turned soccer wife victoria beckham who is reputed to be small enough to fit into a subzero.

Three bills in the works in taiwan — under the leadership of its first female head of state, who expressed support for same-sex marriage just last month — would make taiwan the first asian country to legalize same-sex marriage if passed, reports ap. One of the bills is listed for parliamentary review and could become law within months. \" it's a big step forward for the history of human rights, \" says a ruling democratic progressive party mp, who's sponsoring the bill up for review. \" if taiwan can get this passed … it will give other asian countries a model. \" same-sex marriage appears less controversial in taiwan as in some countries in the region partly because buddhist teachings and traditional chinese religions don't take a strong stance on the issue, explains ap. A 2012 survey found 55 % of taiwanese supported same-sex marriage, with 37 % opposed. The approval rate spikes to 80 % among those 20 to 29, says an lgbt advocacy group. The push for laws in taiwan gained momentum this year after the death of a professor, reports the telegraph. He is believed to have killed himself upon the death of his gay partner because he was denied legal claim to their property. Gay couples raising kids without an official union feel a similar stress. \" now, if something happens to the child, the other partner is nothing but a stranger, \" says one mother of 5-month-old twins.",

On top of that, galveston bay is elevated because of the storm surge, which means the copious amount of rain falling on houston isn't draining. \" a 2- or 3-foot storm surge alone would not have been catastrophic, \" a storm surge expert tells the newspaper. \" it was all these ingredients coming together. \" so how about the boogeyman of climate change? as the atlantic explains, trying to show any such link is a tricky affair. But in a general sense, climate change makes ocean temperatures higher, which might have played a role in a unique harvey phenomenon. Most hurricanes weaken as they approach land and churn up deeper, colder water. But harvey actually intensified, in part because even the deeper water it was churning up was unusually warm. \" this is the main fuel for the storm, \" says kevin trenberth of us national center for atmospheric research. \" although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [ because of that ocean heat ]. \"",

            "Scientists say the effects of hurricane harvey, which has been stalled over the texas gulf coast since friday and dumped more than 20 inches of rain in some areas, were worsened by a lethal confluence of meteorological events: warm water in the gulf of mexico that intensified the rainfall, and a lack of winds in the upper atmosphere that could have steered harvey away from land. Exacerbating the situation, said hal needham, a storm surge expert and founder of the private firm marine weather &amp; climate in galveston, tex., was that the storm surge elevated galveston bay, blocking drainage of the rain that pummeled coastal and inland areas. \"a two- or three-foot storm surge alone would not have been catastrophic, \" mr. Needham said. \"it was all these ingredients coming together. \" and it's not over.",

Germany frauke petry, the lead of germany's rightwing populist alternative für deutschland, said the result was \"encouraging \" as it could herald a political sea-change in europe too. She said: \"it was high time that in the united states of america, people who feel disaffected withdrew their vote for the political establishment. Whilst 93 % of voters in washington dc voted for clinton and in so doing for the retention of their own power structures, the majority of voters across the country want a political new beginning, an economic recovery for the stricken middle class and an end of division in what is still the most powerful country in the world. \" petry added: \"this election result is encouraging for germany and for europe, because trump really has the cards for political sea-change in his hand. I congratulate donald trump on his election victory and on this historic chance. \"we all need to use this together to reshape the transatlantic relationship, and to end the big conflicts in ukraine and syria together with russia. It is our task to guard freedom, democracy, and the rule of law on both sides of the atlantic. \"like americans, citizens of germany must have the courage to put a tick in the ballot box and not remain resigned at home.

The st eye features implanted molecules that glow under low light when in contact with bacteria and viruses that cause a variety of infections, per medical daily. There's even a different color for each disease: green for chlamydia, yellow for herpes, purple for hpv, and blue for syphilis. But the daily dot notes a few issues that may slow this concept from going to market, including people freaking out when the condom starts glowing. And there are more questions from the post, such as what color the condom would glow in the presence of multiple diseases, as well as which person's stds would be detected. Another desirable quality, though, if the boys can get a condom company to work with them ( and the post says some have already come calling ): users can discover stds \" in the privacy of their own homes without the invasive procedures at the doctors, \" daanyaal tells the independent.

An investigation that year, said to be in response to a single patient's claims, found that pediatric specialist reginald archibald \" likely \" acted inappropriately. It also turned up two prior reports on archibald from the 1990s, reports npr. But the hospital, which reportedly contacted the manhattan district attorney's office, says it was unaware of other cases until another former patient came forward this year, more than a decade after archibald's death. A second investigation, which involved talking to former patients, uncovered disturbing sexual misconduct claims, and at least one allegation of rape, reports the new york times. The times also spoke with 17 people, mostly men, who said they were abused between the ages of 6 and 17. The men say archibald, who worked at the hospital from the 1940s to the 1980s, would masturbate them or ask them to masturbate, measure their erect penises, and take photos of them naked. One describes being drugged and raped by archibald at his summer house in canada. A few victims say they complained, to no avail. \" to know that they knew about this in 2004 and didn't reach out to people, it's absolutely outrageous, \" says one man. \" appalled \" by the reports, the hospital says it will create a fund to cover counselling for victims.

Tiny tim's toy foundation, founded more than a decade ago in utah, produces and distributes small wooden cars to children in need around the world. Some of those kids are sick in hospitals, others are living in a tough neighborhood, still others are impoverished in a developing country, but they all react similarly when given the wooden toys: \" kids will drop to the floor and start 'driving'them on the concrete, the tile, the dirt, \" a retired teacher who drives 60 miles round-trip once a week to volunteer at the factory tells the washington post. \" the response of pure joy is always the same. \" thacker and his wife, both 83, came up with the idea for the foundation when he and his wife used to dress up as santa and mrs. Claus and distribute toys to kids in mexico. The wood is donated and the factory's rent is paid by a benefactor. In addition to volunteers — mostly retirees, with an average age of 80 — thacker and his wife get help producing the cars from groups like churches, boy scout troops, and civic organizations. Most of the cars are painted by inmates at a utah correctional facility, and the volunteer who spoke to the post says many of them are moved to the point of tears by the chance to help others. The toys are then distributed by charities, churches, children's hospitals, and even long-haul truckers who stop by the factory to pick up a box, dropping off its contents along their routes. Thacker tells the post he and his wife \" both knew the important role toys played in helping little minds to grow.... For some kids around the world, one of our little wooden cars is the first and only toy they ' ll ever get. \" read the full story here.",

The syrian opposition has in consequence thrown a question mark over its participation undoing weeks of diplomatic arm-twisting by the us and its allies to encourage them to attend. Now, britain for one wants tehran to be more explicit about its backing for a transitional government in syria. That may be a step too far for iran. Geneva ii remains in the balance but"

Wpa2 is used to protect most wifi connections, and the fact that it's broken means attackers may be able to \" read information that was previously assumed to be safely encrypted, \" per mathy vanhoef's report published monday. \" this can be abused to steal sensitive information such as credit card numbers, passwords, chat messages, emails, photos and so on. \" the report says such an attack would work \" against all modern protected wifi networks \" on operating systems including android, linux, apple, windows, openbsd, mediatek, linksys, and more, the guardian reports. Google says it is working on a patch, and microsoft says it's already released a security update to fix the issue. Attackers may also be able to use the vulnerability, which is being called krack ( key reinstallation attack ), to \" inject and manipulate data, \" such as by infecting a website with ransomware or other malware, the report says. The united states computer emergency readiness team issued a warning about krack sunday, and britain's national cyber security centre says it is investigating the weakness. It's particularly significant given that wpa2 is the most secure protocol generally being used to encrypt wifi networks, rather than an older security protocol. The bottom line: \" if your device supports wifi, it is most likely affected. \" another expert says home users need not be too worried, as the attack is \" quite... Complex...

The latest one, involving bird flu, has prompted cdc chief tom frieden to shut down two research labs temporarily and to halt the shipment of risky germs, reports ap. The bird flu mistake actually happened in may but didn't get reported to senior cdc officials until this week. It seems a cdc lab contaminated a sample of relatively harmless h9n2 bird flu with the far more dangerous h5n1 strain before shipping it out to an agriculture department lab, reports the new york times. The second lab realized the mistake quickly, and officials don't think anybody got contaminated. But news of the mistake comes after dozens of cdc employees were potentially exposed to live anthrax because of improper handling. And then came the discovery of six old vials of smallpox in a national institutes of health lab that had no business storing them. It turns out that two of the vials had live virus. \"these events revealed totally unacceptable behavior, \" said frieden, as quoted in the washington post. \"they should never have happened.

        "summary": "Saudi journalist jamal khashoggi was killed in a \" fistfight \" in the saudi consulate in istanbul, the kingdom claimed saturday, admitting for the first time the writer had been slain at its diplomatic post, the ap reports. Authorities say 18 saudi suspects were in custody for his slaying and that four top intelligence officials had been fired. The overnight announcements in saudi state media came more than two weeks after khashoggi, 59, entered istanbul's saudi consulate for paperwork required to marry his turkish fiancee and never came out. Since his disappearance, the kingdom had rejected as \" baseless \" turkish fears he was killed and dismembered there, but growing international pressure and comments by us officials seem to have forced the kingdom to acknowledge the slaying. While it fired officials close to crown prince mohammed bin salman, the kingdom stopped short of implicating him. The saudi statements didn't id the 18 saudis being detained, nor explain what happened to khashoggi's body. It also offered a far different version of events than those of turkish officials, who've said an \" assassination squad \" from the kingdom, including an official from prince mohammed's entourage and an \" autopsy expert, \" flew in ahead of time and laid in wait for khashoggi at the consulate. In a statement friday, white house press secretary sarah sanders said the us will closely follow international investigations into khashoggi's death and will call for justice that is \" timely, transparent, and in accordance with all due process. \" trump called the saudi announcement a \" good first step \" but said what happened to khashoggi was \" unacceptable. \" doubts remain on the saudi story: california rep.

        "summary": "In 1899, a leipzig university marine biologist named carl chun came across a see-through \" sea blob \" in the southern atlantic, and its existence hasn't been confirmed since — until now. Live science reports on the bathochordaeus charon invertebrate ( what it describes as a \" psychedelic slinky \" ), recently spotted off the california coast by a remotely operated vehicle under the supervision of a scientist named, appropriately enough, rob sherlock. The larvacean, known as b. Charon for short, was first noted in the marine biodiversity records journal in august. Larvaceans in general are usually tiny ( think millimeters ), but larger versions like b. Charon — named after the mythical hades ferryman who leads souls across the river styx — boast bodies up to 4 inches long and an unusual feeding filter: the creature passes food through a mucus \" house \" that keeps out larger particles that would clog the inner workings and funnels smaller particles to the larvacean's feeding tube. The mysterious creature had been elusive since chun's original spotting, but many believed he had simply seen an already known entity known as bathochordaeus stygius, and other specimens collected sporadically over the years seemed to back that theory up. Sherlock says his team had no clue that the rov had come across this stuff of legends when they first encountered it in the waters of monterey bay, but when they examined it more carefully, they knew they had made quite a find — and it did prove to be a b. Charon, not a b. Stygius, based on physical characteristics and genetic material, per weather.com. \" it felt like chun had finally been vindicated after years of doubt, \" sherlock tells live science.

        "summary": "Surgical rooms might look like the most sterile of places on tv or in the movies, but a post at atlas obscura reveals a gross truth: surgery can smell, and terribly so. The daughter of one surgeon writes that as a child she was allowed to attend a surgery but had to flee when the cauterizing blade cut through the fat, burning it. Though she found the smell nauseatingly bad, many surgeons report not just getting used to it but even finding it rather pleasant, much like \" a sizzling new york strip. \" and that doesn't even begin to explore the smell of burning bone. Or of bile. Or rotting flesh. But still, there is one smell that might rule them all: dead bowel — surgeons sometimes have to remove a section that has died because the blood supply to it was cut off. Apparently it can be so horrid one doctor describes it as \" the worst possible smell. \" what's worse, it lingers. \" the smell seems to permeate through the gown and gloves and onto your hand, \" the writer's father says. \" it just stays with you. It lingers. It's an overwhelming stench that sticks to you. \" another particularly nasty one involves fournier's gangrene, an infection of the genitals, which smells \" like poop and sewage sludge and rot and dead stuff all rolled into one, \" as one medical student puts it. Think it couldn't get any worse? buzzfeed has compiled a list of 21 of the worst things people have ever smelled. Rotting crabs make the list, as does a spilled bottle of the product the us military uses to harden medics to the grossest smells possible.",

So he went in and sat down, and then ( club employees ) went in and checked on him and he wasn't feeling good, so they called an ambulance. \" he was feeling the onset of a heart attack, \" marquardo says. \" he just didn't know it at the time. \" as of thursday morning, the prop comic was still a dallas-area hospital, where he will remain for a few days while doctors evaluate his heart health.

Gallagher, who had suffered a heart attack during a march 2011 performance in minnesota, was scheduled to perform at hat tricks, a club in lewisville, texas, wednesday. His manager, craig marquardo, tells thewrap that gallagher \" had met a few fans and whatnot, and he was in the office ( of hat tricks ) when he felt a little tired. So he went in and sat down, and then ( club employees ) went in and checked on him and he wasn't feeling good, so they called an ambulance. \" he was feeling the onset of a heart attack, \" marquardo says. \" he just didn't know it at the time. \" as of thursday morning, the prop comic was still a dallas-area hospital, where he will remain for a few days while doctors evaluate his heart health. Also read: letterman comedian booker dropped after comments about women in comedy ( update ) as for gallagher's future tour schedule -- he has performances booked through the end of 2012 -- marquardo says thursday's schedule performance at the dosey doe in woodlands, texas is cancelled, and that the rest of the lineup will be evaluated once the comedian is feeling better. Gallagher, known for his barrage of props, from melon-smashing mallets to giant-sized furniture, rose to fame in the standup boom of the 1980s. The heart attack occurring so close to the anniversary of his previous attack is just the latest odd chapter in his recent career. Recent bizarre episodes included suing his brother, ron gallagher, who used to tour as \" gallagher too \" or \" gallagher two \" and use leo gallagher's signature \" sledge-o-matic \" prop. Leo gallagher had originally given ron permission to be his professional doppelganger, but successfully sued to keep ron from impersonating him"

But while some companies have boosted supply orders, others are preparing more cautiously, saying they don't want to be stuck with extra vibrators and feather-adorned handcuffs — or oversell sexual nirvana to their customers. \" using kegel balls is not too much fun, it's actually hard work to do it right, \" the ceo of a sex-toy manufacturer tells the times. ( whatever toys you may use, be careful when trying out this position. )",

The foreign intelligence surveillance court issued the order april 25, calling on verizon to hand over data on phone calls within the us and from the us to other countries on an \" ongoing, daily basis \"; the order stands until july 19, the guardian reports. The data include the phone numbers at both ends of a conversation, call time and length, user location information, and other identifying features; the court order doesn't, however, call for the conversation's actual content. Because the data is labeled \" metadata, \" there's no need for warrants for each call. The project's legality hinges on a measure in the patriot act noted in a series of warnings from two democratic senators, ron wyden and mark udall, regarding government surveillance based on \" secret legal interpretations. \" the white house defended the move to both the ap and politico today, though in both cases the anonymous white house official cited did not actually confirm the guardian's report. The ap source calls the collected records \" a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats. \" politico's says \" all three branches of government \" approve of the policy. Needless to say, reactions from elsewhere have not been kind: the aclu calls the practice \" beyond orwellian, \" the huffington post reports. Udall wouldn't comment on the details, but called such surveillance \" shocking. \" on twitter, al gore went with \" obscenely outrageous. \" the center for constitutional rights notes, \" this single order covering millions of people is a deceptive end-run around \" the patriot act's requirements.

But the segment that's grabbing attention is one in which king talks about his decision to pull his first novel, rage, from publication, for fear that it might inspire school shooters. Rage depicts a hostage situation in a school, and four teenagers mentioned the book after attacking their schools. In an excerpt from \" guns \" quoted on mediabistro, king says the book didn't turn kids into killers — \" yet i did see rage as a possible accelerant, which is why i pulled it from sale. You don't leave a can of gasoline where a boy with firebug tendencies can lay hands on it. \" in general, however, king's essay argues that the culture has little impact on gun violence, salon reports.",

Richard combs, the ex-police chief of eutawville, was charged with murder yesterday in the 2011 shooting death of 54-year-old bernard bailey, the ap reports. Combs had already been indicted in august 2013 for misconduct in office and had tried to use the \" stand your ground \" defense at that trial a few weeks ago to explain why he had tussled with, then killed bailey — who had come to town hall to contest his daughter's broken-taillight ticket — in the parking lot, but the judge in that case denied him that argument, usa today reports; that denial led to the path for this indictment. Combs, who was put on leave after shooting bailey and released from service six months later, says that after arguing with bailey inside, he followed bailey out to his truck to serve him with an obstruction of justice warrant; he then says bailey tried to drive away, they struggled and combs got caught in the steering wheel. He says he shot bailey twice in the chest because he feared he'd die if bailey drove away, the ap notes. The judge in the misconduct trial noted that the \" stand your ground \" law in south carolina can only be applied when not on one's personal property under strict conditions, and he didn't think combs met those conditions, the times and democrat reports. \" there was no need for mr. Combs to act as he did, \" the judge's order states. \" mr. Combs should have allowed mr.

But a drug just approved by the fda looks to banish double chins, abc news reports. Kybella, which drug manufacturer kythera biopharmaceuticals says could be available by june, is a form of the naturally occurring deoxycholic acid; it's injected into the body, where it penetrates fat cells and attacks their outer membranes, causing them to burst, abc news reports. The fda says patients can receive up to 50 injections per session — though it emphasizes they should be administered by a \" licensed health care professional \" — with a cap of six sessions that are at least one month apart, the ap reports. The injections take about five minutes in total and need just a few days to heal, abc adds. But they're not for everyone: side effects may include bruising, pain, swelling, numbness, and even a few short-lived swallowing episodes, nbc news reports. And the president of the american society for aesthetic plastic surgery worries that \" once it is approved, people will start to use it for other areas of the face or for larger volumes ( of fat ) in other areas \" ( i.e., your butt or gut, which is a no-no ). But kythera says patients who finish treatment won't need more to maintain results, the la times reports. There's no shelf price yet, but the doctor in charge of investigating kybella during clinical trials says it will likely be \" in line with other injectable procedures, \" meaning expect \" several hundred dollars, \" the times adds.

Inarritu's follow-up to birdman, which got him three oscars at this year's academy awards — is out on christmas, and reviews are embargoed until dec. 4, but the hollywood reporter's \" awards analyst \" offers an early look after a screening this week. The film is about a fur trapper who seeks revenge after he's attacked and left for dead, and it's so gory that a few people walked out mid-movie, writes scott feinberg. He notes that many of the early reactions are good, but not all — but that most agree dicaprio \" couldn't have done a better job and looks like the man to beat in the best actor race. \" dicaprio has received four acting nominations during his career, but has yet to win an oscar. \" his almost silent performance, with its incredible physical demands, is the sort clint eastwood might have given if he had dicaprio's drive and discipline as a young man, \" feinberg writes. And others agree: dicaprio \" gives his all \" to a role that \" successfully exterminates every last vestige of his teen-dream twinkdom, \" writes kyle buchanan at vulture, and then there's the fact that \" he doesn't have overwhelming competition this year.

        "summary": "For nearly two decades, scott johnson's death had been labeled a suicide. The 27-year-old's naked body was found dec. 10, 1988, on a cliff overlooking sydney's northern beaches, with his clothes folded above. His brother didn't buy it, and in 2005 he developed an alternate theory: an inquest that year reviewed three other cliff deaths from around the same period, and determined there was a good chance they were murders. Upon learning \" there were three other cases of gay men that died at cliff sides that had probably been attacked by marauding teen gangs, i collapsed, \" steve johnson told wcvb last month. And, perhaps, not without reason. The new york times reports australian officials are now acknowledging that teen gangs attacked gay men for sport in the ' 80s and ' 90s, and did force some over cliffs — with relative impunity. New south wales police are reviewing 88 deaths — about 30 unsolved — going as far back as 1976 to see if they qualify as anti-gay hate crimes. In parallel, a third coroner's inquest into johnson's death is underway; the second, in 2012, removed suicide as his cause of death. Australia's abc points out the only other time a third such inquest has occurred in australia was with the case of azaria chamberlain, the baby taken by a dingo. Johnson, called a brilliant mathematician by those who knew him, had been working on his phd at australian national university in canberra at the time of his death. The australian notes that the inquest, which will resume in june, heard from two people in december who say johnson referenced suicide in conversations with them. But the times notes johnson's phd supervisor told the inquest that on the day he was last seen johnson came to him \" happy, \" sharing a major breakthrough he had made in his work.",

That's apparently a bit of a problem in the middle east, where the facial hair signifies both wisdom and virility, and it's leading more and more men to undergo mustache surgery. Seriously. Cnn reports that mustache implants are on the rise among men in the region, with one turkish plastic surgeon reporting that he now performs as many as 60 such procedures a month. A paris-based surgeon tells a similar tale, saying most of his patients hail from mideast countries like iran, lebanon, and the united arab emirates; are between the ages of 30 and 50; and pay about $ 7,000 for the implant, in which hairs are extracted from dense areas of growth and implanted above the upper lip. Cnn delves more into the history of the mustache in that part of the world: it reports that it's been popular there since ottoman times, and notes that the us consul in algiers in 1795 explained his new mustache in a letter to his wife, saying it had aided him in his work and gave him \" the air of a tiger. \" click for more.",

For all the trouble he has been mixed up in over his long career, stone has never been at any real risk of serving time behind bars. Friday's indictment might change his bearing a bit. It's one thing to rail publicly against the possibility of a theoretical future indictment, but another to see seven federal criminal charges, carrying a total maximum sentence of 50 years, in black and white. As a practical matter, stone isn't looking at anything close to 50 years, but he easily could be facing five years or so if convicted on all counts. For a 66 year-old man like stone, that could mean most or all of the rest of his life, which has to be at least a bit sobering. And the evidence laid out in the indictment seems locked in; over and over again, the indictment quotes stone's lies and then cites hard proof – typically stone's own texts – to prove that he lied. A good prosecutor could make a compelling case that cooperation offers stone his best and most realistic chance to get through the case without having to serve time.

        "summary": "Matthew mcconaughey will speak at the university of houston's commencement ceremony next month, a fact that is more controversial than you might imagine. And not because mcconaughey is, say, underqualified for the job, but because the university refused, for more than a month, to tell the houston chronicle how much it would be paying the actor. But the paper finally got an answer: $ 135,000, which mcconaughey will donate to a mcconaughey-founded charity that aims to help high school students. The convoluted details of the brouhaha: uh first refused to give specifics because of a confidentiality clause in its agreement with the booking agency; that booking agency then fought the newspaper's foia request because the revelation might lead to \" unfair negatives online. \" the attorney general hasn't ruled on the case yet, but the university revealed the fee yesterday because, it explained, it has \" concluded its business \" with the agency and thus is no longer bound by the agreement. The university also said it will pay for the actor's travel costs and will pay the booking agency 15 % of his fee. But, the houston press points out, it's not really clear how the aforementioned booking agency — celebrity talent international, founded by a carlsbad, calif., man that paper calls \" a mysterious, self-proclaimed booking agent \" named glenn richardson — is even involved with the whole matter, or connected to mcconaughey. The actor's photo and suggested fees were listed on cti's \" talent library \" until last week, when they were removed, and a uh spokesperson says that \" neither cti nor richardson represent mcconaughey in any capacity \" but that uh \" engaged the services of cti to help identify and connect with an appropriate commencement speaker and to assist with the logistics of finalizing a contract. \" as for richardson, he's not explaining anything; nor is mcconaughey's talent agency, caa. But mcconaughey's publicist says the actor \" has never met, heard of, spoken to, or worked with anyone named \" glenn richardson — so it's not clear how exactly richardson managed to walk away with a $ 20,250 commission.",

That's because the hearing has renewed interest in the other simpson criminal case, and mike gilbert just happens to own the ford bronco that led police on perhaps the famous police chase in history. The site reports that gilbert is willing to sell the vehicle, and it thinks he can get somewhere in the $ 750,000-to-$ 1 million range. The suv is currently sitting in the alcatraz east crime museum in pigeon forge, tennessee. It was once owned by simpson friend al cowlings, who drove it with simpson inside during the infamous low-speed chase in 1994. As cbs sports explains, simpson himself also owned a white ford bronco, which also figured in the murder case. It was parked in front of his mansion, and police impounded it when they found blood inside. That bronco, however, was later destroyed. ( ford is actually bringing back the model. )",

Nonetheless, per usa today, there are plenty of signs that the islamic state is feeling the strain, including: there have been mass defections, such as the 90 militants who turned themselves over to kurdish forces last week. Kurds in syria and iraq have had recent battlefield victories, capturing key spots along the islamic state's supply line. Fewer militants are guarding isis checkpoints. Elite islamic state fighters, once used as \" shock troops, \" are being used to man checkpoints and other routine duties.

Steve warren, the top spokesman for the counter-isil coalition in baghdad. Top military officials estimate that the campaign has killed 23,000 islamic state fighters, raising their death toll by 3,000 since mid-october. Army gen. Lloyd austin, who oversees u.s. Military operations in the middle east as chief of central command, told troops last week in iraq that the campaign is inflicting maximum pain on the enemy, according to a military official who attended the meeting but who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.

Wholesale defections, sparsely manned checkpoints and elite foreign fighters pressed into mundane duty indicate that the u.s.-led bombing campaign and advances by kurdish forces are eroding the forces of the islamic state, also known as isil, said army col. Steve warren, the top spokesman for the counter-isil coalition in baghdad. Top military officials estimate that the campaign has killed 23,000 islamic state fighters, raising their death toll by 3,000 since mid-october. Army gen. Lloyd austin, who oversees u.s. Military operations in the middle east as chief of central command, told troops last week in iraq that the campaign is inflicting maximum pain on the enemy, according to a military official who attended the meeting but who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.

Gates on isis, syria and american leadership 11: 24 former secretary of defense robert gates called for president obama to speed up his strategy to fight isis in the middle east. \" i think it does need to be sped up and intensified, \" he said in an interview that aired sunday on nbc's \" meet the press. \" \" i think that while isis is a long-term problem for us, we have near-term issues associated with it. \" he cited the paris terror attacks, crashed russian jet in the sinai and deadly explosions in beirut as recent issues that should force the u.s. And its allies to ramp up its efforts against isis. The terrorist group has claimed responsibility for all three incidents. Gates, however, said calls for a brand new strategy are misguided. \" i don't know what that is, \" he said. \" putting tens of thousands of u.s. Troops in there is not a near-term solution. It would take months and months, even if you decided you wanted to do it, to put the logistics in place, get the troops trained, and so on, \" gates continued. \" and then i ' m not sure they don't aggravate the problem. \" instead, gates suggested advisors"

The bill — which includes changes to how medicare pays doctors and extends the children's health insurance program until 2017 — passed with a 92-8 vote yesterday, hours before doctors were to see a 21 % cut in medicare fees, the new york times reports. President obama says the \" milestone \" bill \" could help slow health care cost growth \" and is expected to sign it into law, usa today reports. The bill will likely keep doctors from turning away medicare patients and will adjust payment to focus on quality of care. Presidential candidates ted cruz and marco rubio voted against the bill. Sen. Mitch mcconnell says the legislation, negotiated by john boehner and nancy pelosi, is \" a solution to a broken medicare payment system that has vexed congressional leaders of both parties for years \" and will \" ensure seniors on medicare don't lose access to their doctors. \" democratic sen. Ron wyden says the bill addresses a \" horrendously flawed \" doctor payment system set up in 1997 that depends on the number of procedures performed, the los angeles times reports. The new system would see doctors ' pay increase 0.5 % through 2019, after which bonuses or penalties would be given based on the value of their care. It would add $ 140 billion to federal deficits over 10 years.",

Persson, 35, is the swedish game developer who created the wildly popular game minecraft and recently sold its maker to microsoft for $ 2.5 billion. ( as gamespot reports, he would have made $ 1.75 billion thanks to his 70 % stake in minecraft parent company mojang. ) there was \" much celebrity and international buyer interest \" in the property, and persson won a bidding war for it, according to a release from the john aaroe group. As kotaku points out, persson may have even beat out beyonce and jay z to buy the estate. The new york daily news reported back in september that bey and jay were interested in the mansion, which reportedly also has a 16-car garage complete with elevator so the cars can be moved to a gallery-style showroom. As part of the deal ( forbes notes that he paid cash ), persson also snapped up everything that was in the house. That includes an 18-foot onyx dining room table with 24 roberto cavalli place settings that cost $ 3,700 each, a replica of james dean's motorcycle, and cases of dom perignon, according to the release. ( also included: eight oral-b 3d braun toothbrushes, provided by the listing agent, who scoffs at the line \" just bring your toothbrush. \" ) last night, persson tweeted a photo presumably of himself relaxing in his new place, complete with a view of what we assume is the aforementioned candy room.

But even by those superhuman standards, british ultrarunner lizzy hawker, 36, is particularly, well, ultra. Hawker is the five-time women's division winner of the ultra-trail du mont-blanc, one of the toughest trail races in the world, which sees competitors run more than 100 miles in the french alps. Last year, she ran that race, as well as the 100-mile run rabbit run in colorado and the 155-mile spartathlon ultra race in greece — all in the space of four weeks, the new york times reports. Hawker entered the ultra-trail du mont-blanc the first time in 2005 on a whim while on holiday nearby. Twenty-six hours and 53 minutes later, she was the first woman across the finish line. \"i ran every day, so i knew i had endurance, but there was no indication i'd be good, \" she says. From there, hawker's ultrarunning career took off; she has since won 35 trail ultras. The sport offers plenty of injuries, but little to no prize money or fame. So why do it? \" running is a way of moving i really love, \" she says, \" and i love being outside in the mountains. \" ( click for the full profile, which includes a wild tale of how hawker dealt with a canceled flight while in nepal — by just running 200 miles to her destination. )",

Asked by the pundit what has been the hardest thing she's had to deal with, trump went to her husband's go-to punching bags. \"i would say the opportunists who are using my name or my family name to advance themselves, \" she answered. \" from comedians, to journalists, to performers, book writers... \" asked if that \"hurt, \" trump sounded as though she had taken another page from her husband's script, where the term \"fake news \" is a recurring phrase. \"it doesn't hurt,",

        "summary": "Arkansas hasn't carried out an execution since 2005 due to legal challenges and the availability of necessary drugs. It's apparently ready to make up for lost time. Gov. Asa hutchinson has scheduled eight executions over 10 days in april. There will be two executions by lethal injection per day on four days. The state is in a hurry because one of its execution drugs expires at the end of april, and the drug-maker isn't selling it for executions anymore. But the rate of executions about to be attempted by arkansas is unprecedented since the supreme court brought the death penalty back in 1976. Here's what you need to know: a former georgia department of corrections commissioner is worried about the effect of the intense execution schedule on those who have to carry them out. He ordered five deaths over two years and is still haunted by them decades later. \"i don't remember their names, but i still see them in my nightmares, \" he tells the guardian. In an editorial, the los angeles times accuses arkansas of creating a death penalty \" assembly line \" and says a better solution is to \" abandon the barbaric practice of capital punishment \" all together. Two of the inmates scheduled to be executed next month have filed petitions asking for a stay of execution, the northwest arkansas democrat gazette reports. One inmate with extreme schizophrenia is being backed by a national nonprofit. A lawsuit over the state's method of execution — just part of a flurry of legal activity surrounding next month's executions — was struck down by the arkansas supreme court, arkansas online reports. The new york times reports the state, which requires six witnesses per execution, is having a hard time finding people willing to volunteer. The director of the department of corrections even went so far as to ask members of the little rock rotary club if they were interested; they thought she was joking. The bbc has a list of the eight men scheduled to be executed next month and their crimes, which date back to 1989. Finally, slate reports at least six of the inmates scheduled to be executed are very likely suffering from \" crippling mental impairments. \"",
