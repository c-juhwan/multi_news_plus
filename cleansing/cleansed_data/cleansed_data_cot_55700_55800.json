The job gain was down from the average increase of 200,000 over the past three months, which is the softest three-month pace since october. The slowdown may raise concerns that weak us economic growth has discouraged some employers from hiring. The economy's growth has slumped to a sluggish 1 % annual rate since october. Meanwhile, the labor participation rate went down to 62.8 %, per money. But there was good news on the wage gains front: average hourly pay rose 2.5 % from a year earlier — a \" hot number, \" the wall street journal notes, and above the sluggish 2 % pace that has been typical for the past six years. Money reports that consumer confidence in the jobs that are out there is rising, with more people perceiving that jobs are \" plentiful \" rather than \" hard to get \" for the first time since the great recession ended. The journal notes that april's jobs report will only serve to keep the fed in \" standby mode \" as it ponders whether to boost the short-term interest rate. Officials had suggested that such a rate increase in june may have been in the cards if the economy picked up steam — but now it will likely take better news on consumption, hiring, and inflation for the rate increase to happen.",

Hourly earnings, meanwhile, showed signs of life and grew 2.5 % over the past 12 months, while the labor force participation rate decreased to 62.8 %. Late last month, the government reported that the economy grew at a tepid annual rate of 0.5 % in the first three months of the year, raising fears that the seven-year-old economic expansion may be nearing an end.

The death toll could rise further as dozens are still in critical condition, said dr. Mohammad baqar, a senior rescue official in the area. There were dozens of other injuries of varying degree, he said. Local news channels showed black smoke billowing skyward and scores of burned bodies, as well as rescue officials speeding the injured to hospital and army helicopters ferrying the wounded. Saznoor ahmad, 30, whose two cousins were killed in the fire, said the crowd of people screamed as the flames engulfed them. \" the fire moved so fast, \" he said.

Estes is far from the only person outraged — sasha lekach at mashable calls united's attempts at apologizing for the situation \" meaningless corporate jargon \" that just enraged people more. At the los angeles times, michael hiltzik says united's handling of the entire incident was \" botched \" and shameful, but notes that the real problem is that the law allows airlines to overbook, even at risk of a situation like this. \" how many businesses do you know of that can sell you a good or service, accept payment, and then withdraw that good or service unilaterally for their own purposes — much less by force? \" at slate, daniel gross calls the overbooking system airlines use \" ridiculous \" and \" outdated, \" and notes that lately, more passengers than usual are getting bumped from overbooked flights, a fair number of them involuntarily: it's time for \" a better way, \" he writes.

        "summary": "Norway is entering the history books with a radio-related first: the country is shutting down its fm radio network in favor of digital-only transmissions, reports the local. The country will begin cutting its fm network on wednesday, starting with the northern city of bodo, before moving south. All five national channels on fm will stop broadcasting by the end of the year, per vocativ, though some local stations will continue fm broadcasts until 2022. The plan has been in place for years as digital radio costs norway the same as the fm network, $ 29 million, but allows for eight times more radio stations. But residents aren't impressed. A poll shows 66 % of norwegians oppose the move, compared to 17 % in favor and 17 % undecided, reports reuters. Among the critics are the owners of 2 million vehicles without digital audio broadcasting receivers who will need a $ 170 digital adapter and those who fear emergency alerts usually broadcast on fm radio will go unheard. \" we are simply not ready for this yet, \" says a member of the ruling coalition government, noting \" millions \" of in-home radios will be rendered useless. \" but norway has made its decision, \" says the chairman of the norwegian local radio federation. \" for practical and economic reasons it is too late to turn back now. \" norway will now be watched closely by the uk, south korea, sweden, and denmark, all considering the switch.

The bbc reports on the 24-year search for qifeng, who disappeared from her parents ' roadside fruit stand in chengdu city in january 1994; she was just 3. Wang mingqing and wife liu dengying spent more than two decades searching for their girl, through newspaper ads and online posts. They remained in chengdu, hoping it would increase the chances that qifeng would find them, and in 2015, wang began driving for the uber-like didi chuxing and spreading the word. His car contained information about his search, passengers were given information about his daughter, and the south china morning post reports he asked riders to post about his search on social media. Then, a break, by way of a police sketch artist. The artist heard about the search and offered to create an age progression drawing showing what an adult qifeng might look like — and, in a province far to the north, kang ying saw it and thought it looked a whole lot like her. She reached out to yang in mid-march, per global news, and a dna test was arranged for; it proved she was qifeng, and the family was reunited on tuesday. The morning post reports kang grew up 12 miles from chengdu, with parents who told her they had adopted her. ( this missing 9-year-old was found thanks to a reality tv show. )",

            "Washington — the obama administration presented its case for possible military action against syria to congressional leaders, including evidence from an intercepted phone call involving a high-level syrian official, which a lawmaker said officials offered as proof of a government chemical-weapons attack. The evidence was part of a 90-minute, unclassified briefing delivered to the congressional leaders in a conference call thursday evening. The administration officials made clear that its focus in syria was on \" preventing [ president bashar ] al-assad from using chemical weapons again, \" said a democratic aide briefed on the call. The administration wasn't deterred by thursday's vote in the british parliament that prompted the government to drop its own military plans. \" the administration is figuring out the best way to do that and is seeking as much international support as possible, but won't let that dictate what our policy will be, \" the aide said. Several lawmakers said they came away from the briefing with a conviction that the assad regime was behind the attack, but that president barack obama must do more to persuade the country military action is needed and to rally international support.

        "summary": "In a rare bit of good news in the animal conservation world, scientists say they vastly lowballed the penguin population on antarctica. The off-base estimate pertains to adelie penguins — that's the adorable happy feet variety — and it turns out there are 3.6 million more of them than previously thought, reports the huffington post australia. A team of australian, japanese, and french scientists now think there are 5.9 million of these birds occupying a 3,100-mile stretch of east antarctica. From that projection, they pegged the total adelie penguin population on the continent at 14 million to 16 million. The adelies, named after the wife of the french explorer who discovered them in 1840, are only found on antarctica and its islands. So why did their number take such a leap? \" the reason it's higher is we have incorporated the non-breeding component of the population, \" says aussie ecologist dr. Louise emmerson. What that means is that while the breeding birds migrate to the island to do the deed and then sit on eggs, making them easy to count, non-breeders are \" off foraging out in the water where we can't see them, \" she says. It turns out the non-breeders were more numerous. How did the experts revise their count? they used aerial surveillance and land-based counting methods, and they studied penguin droppings to ballpark the amount of food the tuxedoed ones consume: an estimated 213,000 tons of krill and 21,000 tons of fish during the breeding season, per the afp. The findings could help inform conservation efforts for marine and land animals, per the australian. ( what happened to 150k missing penguins? )",

Research by an australian, french and japanese team used aerial and ground surveys, tagging and resighting data and automated camera images over several breeding seasons, which allowed them to come up with the new figure. They focused on a 5,000 kilometre ( 3,100 mile ) stretch of coastline, estimating it was home to 5.9 million birds — some 3.6 million more than previously thought. On this basis, they estimate a likely global population of 14 to 16 million. Before, population estimates only took into account breeding pairs, said australian antarctic division seabird ecologist louise emmerson. \" non-breeding birds are harder to count because they are out foraging at sea, rather than nesting in colonies on land, \" she said. \" however, our study in east antarctica has shown that non-breeding adelie penguins may be as, or more, abundant than the breeders. \" these birds are an important reservoir of future breeders and estimating their numbers ensures we better understand the entire population's foraging needs. \" adelie penguins, slick and efficient swimmers, live on the antarctic continent",

        "summary": "An amazing, if grisly, feat continues to resonate after a report in thursday's globe and mail of toronto. The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a canadian sniper in iraq killed an isis militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: the training: if confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by canadians, notes maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because canadian snipers \" are not simply taught to hit their targets. \" the training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to \" design and run complex operations \" if necessary. \" that in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill. \" long history: the cbc examines the history of canada's military marksmanship, noting that cpl. Francis pegahmagabow of the 1st canadian infantry battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of world war i. A military historian says the skill carried into wwii. \" the best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt. \" official statement: the canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. \" a member of the joint task force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters, \" it says in an email to npr, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? the globe and mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The washington post talks to former us snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former marine shooter: \" a spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim. \" yes: canadian cpl. Rob furlong, who once held the record himself at 2,430 meters, counters the skeptics: \"it's not an impossible distance, \" he says. \"so to the naysayers i would just say, this can be done. \" it's a \" hell of a shot, \" adds former canadian sniper jody mitic, who was written a book called, of course, unflinching: the making of a canadian sniper.

That's the gist of a complaint filed in chicago last month by a california woman who says ulta repackaged returned cosmetics and placed the items back on store shelves, the los angeles times reports. \" every customer who has purchased cosmetics at ulta since this practice began was put at risk of unwittingly purchasing used, unsanitary cosmetics, \" the lawsuit states. Kimberley laura smith-brown of los angeles alleges she stocked up on dozens of items from ulta's sherman oaks location over the past six months or so — and then saw whispers on social media that her stash may not have been as pristine as she thought. A twitter user who said she was an ex-ulta employee started the hubbub, claiming that when she worked there, her manager would instruct employees to clean returned items with cotton swabs and alcohol, seal them back up, then slip them back on the shelves. And, she said, they \" would resell everything ( makeup, hair care, skincare, fragrance, hair tools, etc. ). \" other supposed ulta employees both refuted and supported her claims. Abc action news reports a second lawsuit was filed last week in illinois ' cook county circuit court, with plaintiff meghan devries alleging ulta managers are given a \" quota \" of how many returned items can be listed as \" damaged, \" per a release.

Dan hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the university of chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arxiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, livescience reports. \" the presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate, \" writes hooper. \" as a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the local group [ of galaxies including the milky way ] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them. \" therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \" dyson spheres \" — an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes livescience — to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of russian astronomer nikolai kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies ' light signatures if stars are drained energy — that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it.",

The spate of headlines was kicked off by an official state health advisory warning that the drink, usually served in a copper mug, poses a health risk if the wrong kind of mug is used. For the uninitiated, a moscow mule has vodka, ginger beer, and lime, and thus is acidic, explains live science. The problem is, you're not supposed to serve acidic beverages in mugs with a copper interior because it raises the risk of copper leaching into the drink. Solution? a mug with a copper exterior is fine, but make sure the interior is made of stainless steel, nickel, or some other alternative. The advice isn't new, but the state felt compelled to issue the advisory given the \" recent popularity of moscow mules. \" ( a cruise through instagram proves the point. ) iowa's warning is based on an fda advisory from a few years ago. Specifically, it says that drinks with a ph level of 6.0 or under should not be served in pure copper mugs, and the mule falls into that category. For the record, so do fruit juices, vinegar, and wine, notes the daily news. ( some might prefer a little food poisoning to this cocktail ingredient. )",

Joseph james pappas, 62, should be considered armed, dangerous, and possibly suicidal, houston police chief art acevedo said at a news conference wednesday afternoon. \" there was a lot of planning that went into this, \" acevedo said of the july 20 attack on dr. Mark hausknecht, adding that it appears a \" 20-year-old grudge \" led to the attack, per cnn. Hausknecht was gunned down while riding his bike to work at houston methodist hospital, which is part of the busy texas medical center. Authorities say the shooter rode past hausknecht before turning around and firing. A tip on tuesday led police to suspect pappas, the chief said, though he didn't elaborate as to the nature of the tip. Acevedo said pappas hadn't been seen in 36 to 48 hours, the ap reports. He said the last anyone had heard from pappas was in a tuesday morning text message in which pappas wrote that he was going to kill himself. Acevedo said police searched his home at 4am wednesday and found evidence that ties pappas to the killing, but he declined to elaborate as to the nature of the evidence. The chief said pappas, who was a peace officer in harris county for three decades per the houston chronicle, is white and very fit, and that he's likely getting around on his 10-speed bicycle, which he rides \" extensively and almost exclusively. \" friends and family have described hausknecht as a humble and generous man who was adored by his patients, volunteered in his community and cared about the environment. He was also an avid cyclist and rode his bike to work each morning, as he lived less than 2 miles from his office.",

The whole genome sequencing also reveals more about ötzi's ancestors. Earlier research analyzed ötzi's mitochondrial dna, which is inherited through only the female line, but had found few known matches among modern populations. Now sequencing of his y chromosome places him in the rare g2a4 haplogroup, meaning that his paternal genes are linked to a population that left"

        "summary": "In what one conservationist is calling an \" environmental nightmare, \" an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 atlantic salmon busted out of their holding pen over the weekend after a net broke, and the washington department of fish and wildlife is now pleading with locals to help catch as many as they can. Cooke aquaculture's net pen was holding around 305,000 farmed salmon when anchor lines to the pen gave way and service walkways tipped on saturday, reports the seattle times. The wdfw is now asking for the public's help in scooping the escaped fish out of the waters near cypress island ( or wherever they may turn up ), with no size or quantity restrictions. The exodus has environmentalists concerned, as they're afraid the farmed escapees could take over the feeding and spawning grounds of native chinook and steelhead salmon and pass on disease, kuow notes. Cooke says in a statement that \" exceptionally high tides and currents coinciding with this week's solar eclipse \" contributed to the \" structural failure \" that led to the salmon's breakout. But environmentalists are pushing back on that, king 5 notes, with one organization claiming cooke had the same net issue earlier this summer. Kuow also reports that tide tables and current and wind speed numbers weren't unusually high on saturday. A cooke spokeswoman doubled down on the eclipse explainer late tuesday, and she also added that the escaped salmon weren't a threat to native fish because they wouldn't survive. \" it's primarily a business loss, \" she tells the times. The salmon, which weigh about 10 pounds each, \" will be food for the seals and the fishermen can enjoy them. \" ( is california's salmon population in big trouble? )",

Lummi fishers out for chinook on sunday near samish, south of bellingham bay, were shocked to pull up the spotted, silvery-sided atlantic salmon — escapees that turned up in their nets again monday. The washington department of fish and wildlife ( wdfw ) is urging the public to catch as many of the fish as possible, with no limit on size or number. The fish are about 10 pounds each. No one knows how many",
            "It was a convenient explanation. Officials said the eclipse brought on high tides around cypress island, off washington state – and that's why thousands of farmed atlantic salmon managed to free themselves from their floating net pens in puget sound. It turns out that explanation doesn't hold water. That's because the tides around cypress island, where the pens are located, were not abnormally high on saturday, when the pens collapsed. Tide tables show that the island had higher tides every month this year than the 7.9-foot tide predicted to reach the island about 5 p.m. On saturday. The escape of so many atlantic salmon is an \"environmental nightmare, \" said kurt beardslee, director of the wild fish conservancy northwest. \"the atlantic salmon bring with them pollution, virus and parasite amplification, and all that harms pacific salmon and our waters of washington, \" beardslee said.",

            "Thousands of farmed atlantic salmon were accidentally released into the waters between anacortes and the san juan islands, and officials are asking people to catch as many as possible. Tribal fishers, concerned about native salmon populations, call the accident \"a devastation. \" it's open season on atlantic salmon as the public is urged to help mop up a salmon spill from a damaged net pen holding 305,000 fish at a cooke aquaculture fish farm near cypress island. Lummi fishers out for chinook on sunday near samish, south of bellingham bay, were shocked to pull up the spotted, silvery-sided atlantic salmon — escapees that turned up in their nets again monday.

No one knows how many",
            "It was a convenient explanation. Officials said the eclipse brought on high tides around cypress island, off washington state – and that's why thousands of farmed atlantic salmon managed to free themselves from their floating net pens in puget sound. It turns out that explanation doesn't hold water. That's because the tides around cypress island, where the pens are located, were not abnormally high on saturday, when the pens collapsed. Tide tables show that the island had higher tides every month this year than the 7.9-foot tide predicted to reach the island about 5 p.m. On saturday. The escape of so many atlantic salmon is an \"environmental nightmare, \" said kurt beardslee, director of the wild fish conservancy northwest. \"the atlantic salmon bring with them pollution, virus and parasite amplification, and all that harms pacific salmon and our waters of washington, \" beardslee said.",

The details begin before that, per the daily camera: with his wife out of town on business, watts on saturday took girlfriend nichol kessinger to dinner, though he told police and others he had dinner with friends. More: kessinger says he uncharacteristically paid with a credit card, rather than a gift card, which she took as a sign that he no longer needed to hide their relationship from his wife ( whom watts told her he had divorced ). The $ 62 charge caught shanann watts ' eye; she mentioned it to a friend as suspiciously high considering her husband told her he had salmon and a beer. Cbs denver reports on aug. 5, shanann texted watts, \" l just don't get it. You don't fall out of love in 5 weeks. \" cnn reports shanann took her girls on a lengthy summer trip to north carolina to see family; watts joined her for the last week of the trip, but the two were apart from june 27 to july 30.

But 34 % was still a record for le pen's national front, and analysts say it shows the pro-business, pro-eu macron has a big struggle ahead to unite a divided nation — as does the fact that in a race between two political outsiders, more than a third of voters either didn't show up or cast a blank ballot. A roundup of coverage: the bbc looks at five reasons for what it calls the \" political earthquake \" of macron's victory. They include the scandal that knocked out the initial front-runner, and a strong grassroots operation inspired by barack obama's 2008 victory. The result may be a sign that the \" populist wave \" that led to the brexit vote and the election of president trump may be fading, the new york times reports. \" i understand the divisions of our country that have led some to vote for extremists, \" macron said after the vote. \" i understand the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that a great part among us have also expressed. \" governing is going to be the hard part for macron, who will have to deal with the country's established political parties while implementing his \" neither left nor right \" policies, ej dionne writes in a washington post op-ed. \" macron is both a former investment banker and a moderate social democrat, \" he writes. \" demonstrating how these two sides of him fit together will define the drama of his presidency. \" the guardian predicts that there will be no honeymoon period for the 39-year-old president-elect and his \" en marche \" movement. As well as the sharp divide between left and right, he has to deal with problems including mass youth unemployment, rising inequality, and the threat of terrorism, which still has the country under a state of emergency. Condoleezza rice tells usa today that despite the defeat, marine le pen and similar anti-free trade, anti-immigration populists are still having a worrying effect on politics. \" i really do believe that these populists are changing the character of the politics just by being there, so even mainstream candidates are having to respond to their agenda, \" she says.

Generally, students deemed more attractive were also deemed smarter, especially among the women. Little surprise there, but somehow the 160 students were more able to spot men's actual iq. Why is that? maybe signs of higher intelligence are only visible in men's faces \" due to some genetic and developmental association, \" the researchers write. \" another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness, \" which prevents \" an accurate assessment of their intelligence. \" what's more, our ability to quickly identify a person's iq may have \" evolutionary \" consequences, the researchers say, the daily mail reports.

Knowing elliot \" can go a lot of places in seven hours, \" police went door-to-door and had schools locked down before releasing students under a heavy police presence. Then a call about a stolen vehicle came in to the laporte county sheriff's office, and a deputy saw the vehicle and attempted a traffic stop, wood-tv reports. But the driver kept going and led authorities on a 5-minute chase. Stop sticks disabled his tires in kankakee township; elliot jumped out and tried to run but was arrested and booked. He was serving five life sentences for the murders of four people when he broke out of the ionia correctional facility yesterday by slipping through a gap in the fencing system.",

Lindsey graham to replace obamacare. Per ew, kimmel addressed president trump at the outset, noting that the commander in chief's aim is dumping obamacare, \" which he hates, primarily because obama's name is on it. … he'd sign copies of the koran at the barnes and noble in fallujah if it meant he could get rid of obamacare. \" kimmel did have praise to offer for cassidy, a doctor who started a community clinic in his home state. \" he's done good things; i just want him to keep doing good things. This plan is not a good thing, \" said kimmel, who then rattled off the doctor-tied organizations, including the ama, that have come out against the bill. Although some media sources have given kimmel a thumbs-up for his understanding of the legislation, the national review has jumped into the fray, calling the host a \" policy wonk wannabe \" and asserting that \" comedians are not public intellectuals. \" \" does kimmel want a career change? \" writes theodore kupfer. \" or does hollywood simply want to feel better about its propensity to wax earnest about complicated public-policy questions? \" some are coming to kimmel's defense with clips of the conservative-leaning fox news interviewing other celebrities on various topics. Kimmel wrapped up his latest launch against cassidy by addressing critics. \" some people tell me i should give him the benefit of the doubt, \" he said. \" and you know what, i do give him the benefit of the doubt: i doubt all the benefits he claims are part of the new health care bill. \" the whole clip here.",

        "summary": "Tension between president trump and mexico over his border wall plans was probably inevitable, though not everybody expected it to flare up before his administration was a week old. After trump signed an executive order wednesday and promised to start building the wall within months, mexican president enrique peña nieto told his country in a televised address that mexico \" does not believe in walls \" and will not pay for it, no matter what trump says, the bbc reports. \" i regret and condemn the decision of the united states to continue construction of a wall that, for years, has divided us instead of uniting us, \" he said. In other coverage: peña nieto said mexico still offers its friendship to the us, but he didn't confirm whether he plans to go ahead with his jan. 31 meeting with trump at the white house, the guardian reports. Senior government officials said late wednesday that the mexican leader is thinking about calling it off. Cnn reports that peña nieto said he would wait for an evaluation from mexican officials in the us before confirming the visit to the us. He also said he had ordered government agencies, including the 50 mexican consulates in the us, to step up protection for immigrants. The washington post looks at five major challenges the wall project will face, including rough terrain and the fact that most land along the border in texas is privately owned. In mexico, people are furious and are calling for a stern response to trump's plans, reports the new york times. \" it's like we are charlie brown and they are lucy with the football, \" says former foreign minister jorge castaneda. \" peña is a weak president in a weak country at a weak moment, but he has to find a way to get some official backbone. \" historians say the last president to anger mexico this much was calvin coolidge, who threatened to invade \" soviet mexico \" in the 1920s. The los angeles times looks at the details of the border wall project and other immigration-related actions trump unveiled wednesday. His plan to withhold federal grants from \" sanctuary cities \" like la is expected to start legal battles that will last for years.",

Ars technica reports the data for the first major study of us bodycam footage comes from 981 traffic stops conducted by 245 oakland, calif., police officers in 2014. Researchers had volunteers rate comments made by officers during the traffic stops in terms of respectfulness and more, per the los angeles times. The bbc reports respectful behavior by officers included apologizing, showing an interest in the person, and saying \" drive safely. \" disrespectful behavior included asking questions, calling the person \" bro \" or \" man, \" and using words that have a negative connotation. The study found officers were 57 % more likely to use one of the most respectful phrases with white people and 61 % more likely to use one of the most disrespectful phrases with black people. For example, white people were more likely to be called \" sir \" or \" ma ' am, \" while black people were more likely to be called by their first names. Officers were also found to be less polite, formal, friendly, and impartial with black people. The race of the officer didn't appear to change things. \" these routine interactions are important, \" researcher jennifer eberhardt says, per the bbc. \" they're the way most people encounter the police. \" and if those encounters go poorly, citizens may become less supportive or cooperative toward police.

On february 27, 1859, sickles gunned down his friend philip barton key ( whose father wrote \" the star-spangled banner \" ) in washington, dc, for having an affair with sickles ' wife. Then came the court case, where one of sickles'seven lawyers claimed it was manslaughter, not murder, perpetrated in \" a state of heat \" that put sickles above \" the pale of accountability to the criminal law. \" he added that it's \" no matter how a man becomes insane; is he insane, this is the question? \" the district attorney saw it differently, saying sickles planned the attack and carried three pistols to the crime scene. But public opinion sided with sickles, as did harper's and the new york times. And sickles'theatricality won over jurors, moving some to tears when he cried during a friend's testimony and had to be escorted from the courtroom. The jury needed just 30 minutes to find him not guilty. In a twist, public opinion turned against sickles when he made up with his wife, teresa ( who had only cheated on him over his \" compulsive womanizing, \" according to an old times review of a sickles biography ). And when sickles became ambassador to spain, after teresa's death by tuberculosis, he supposedly hooked up with spain's deposed queen, isabella ii — who was married at the time.

It pointed sickles to an address on fifteenth street where neighbors had noticed a man who did not reside there frequently tying a string or ribbon on the door. Sickles sent a trusted friend to the address and he witnessed a woman fitting teresa's description entering through the rear door, and a man resembling key entering through the front. They would stay about an hour. Key was a widower whose appetite for gambling, horses, and women was well-known. It was later revealed he would watch the house from a club across the street.

El-dahan said she sought help from the bank's human-relations department beginning in september. She said her managers played favorites, denied employees ' breaks that are required by law and regularly threatened employees about meeting sales quotas. Employees responded by opening bogus accounts for customers who didn't want them on a \" daily \" basis, she told the times. When she asked to be transferred to another branch, she was referred back to her managers, she said. An emailed letter of complaint to bank directors and a signed letter to wells fargo's chief executive, john stumpf, drew no response, el-dahan said. She believes she was fired in retaliation for speaking out.

El-dahan said she sought help from the bank's human-relations department beginning in september. She said her managers played favorites, denied employees ' breaks that are required by law and regularly threatened employees about meeting sales quotas. Employees responded by opening bogus accounts for customers who didn't want them on a \" daily \" basis, she told the times.

Authorities are considering every possible explanation for the disappearance, says malaysia's civil aviation boss, azharuddin abdul rahman. Among those explanations are engine failure, pilot error, or possibly suicide. But so far, searches have yielded little information — even with 40 ships and 34 aircraft investigating a radius of 50 nautical miles around where the plane dropped off radar screens, the ap reports. Nine countries are involved in the search, and they're working \" every hour, every minute, every second, \" rahman adds, per the guardian. It's now after dark in the area, and the search will resume tomorrow. In other search news: as for hijacking, \" we are not discounting this, \" says rahman, via the ap. Malaysia says it has cctv visuals of two people traveling with stolen passports. Officials said today at a news conference that the two were not \" asian-looking people, \" as per the bbc. One-way tickets under the names on the stolen passports — luigi maraldi and christian kozel — were issued at a thai travel agency. Passengers traveling under those names were also booked on a one-way flight from beijing to amsterdam saturday, says a rep for royal dutch airlines. Maraldi was then due to fly to copenhagen, while kozel was set to go to frankfurt, germany. Malaysia is now downplaying reports suggesting vietnam had discovered possible debris. \" we have not found anything that appear to be objects from the aircraft, let alone the aircraft, \" says rahman, per cnn. Officials had believed they'd spotted a life raft in the water, and helicopters were rushed to the spot — only to find a \" moss-covered cap of a cable reel, \" nbc news reports.

Lambach would allegedly seek out women with drug addictions and post their pictures online, then arrange meetings with clients. Some of these meetings took place in van wert's apartment in a senior facility. Van wert offered his apartment in return for cash or drugs. The berkshire eagle reports that the police investigation began last spring in response to citizen complaints about increased prostitution across the city. Lambach would allegedly keep up to 90 % of the money the women made, sometimes refusing them cash altogether and paying them in heroin or crack cocaine instead. At least one woman said lambach drove her to an \" appointment \" across state lines. Police estimated one of the victims was 15 years old. They were also told that some of the women were lambach's former foster children. Both men have pleaded not guilty, lambach to four counts of human trafficking and van wert to conspiracy to commit human trafficking, deriving support from prostitution, maintaining a house of prostitution, and sexual conduct for a fee.",
