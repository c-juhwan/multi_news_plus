        "summary": "Israeli researchers say they have deciphered one of the last remaining puzzles of the dead sea scrolls. It turns out the ancient authors of this particular section were writing about the changing of the seasons and the calendar they used to mark and celebrate such occasions, reports the catholic news agency. Two professors from haifa university spent a year piecing together about 60 tiny fragments that had been written in code thousands of years ago, reports the bbc. The researchers concluded that the authors, possibly members of a desert sect known as the essenes, were writing about a festival held four times a year to mark the new seasons, and they further determined that the name for this festival was \" tekufah, \" which means \" period \" in today's hebrew. One interesting tidbit: it seems that an ancient editor went over the manuscript after it was originally written and made corrections in the margins. \" what's nice is that these comments were hints that helped me figure out the puzzle — they showed me how to assemble the scroll, \" haifa's eshbal ratson tells haaretz. The researchers also were able to conclude that the sect used a 364-day calendar to mark the year, reports the jerusalem post. \"because this number can be divided into four and seven, special occasions always fall on the same day, \" say the researchers. The professors found this to be \" perfect. \" ( last year, researchers discovered what they believe to be another dead sea scrolls cave, but looters beat them to it. )",

The challenge facing any plan for reducing the debt was underscored when a new republican proposal to raise the ceiling on federal borrowing was met monday with misgivings by some conservatives and skepticism by many gop freshmen. That called into question whether boehner ( r-ohio ) could even get his own caucus to back his approach. As boehner tried to rally support for his two-step plan to cut $ 3 trillion in spending, senate majority leader harry m. Reid ( d-nev. ) offered a strikingly similar proposal for increasing the debt limit before the aug. 2 deadline. The two leaders, however, remained bitterly divided over boehner's demand to",
            "In response to mr. Obama, mr. Boehner said: \"the sad truth is that the president wanted a blank check six months ago, and he wants a blank check today. That is just not going to happen. \" mr. Boehner urged the president to sign a republican plan to raise the debt limit. \"if the president signs it, \" he said, \"the 'crisis ' atmosphere he has created will simply disappear. The debt limit will be raised. \" earlier in the day, in dueling news conferences on capitol hill, neither side showed any willingness to budge even though time was running very short, creating a distinct air of uncertainty around the capitol about how the debt limit conflict would end. \"we're about to go over the cliff, \" senator harry reid, the nevada democrat who serves as majority leader, said monday afternoon as he outlined his plan.

It was chris hansen, ex-host of nbc's to catch a predator series, rebooting his famous show as hansen vs. Predator — but this time without the support of any tv network in what the new republic calls \" america's first-ever kickstarter-funded sex sting. \" hansen's original show ended in 2013 when his contract wasn't renewed shortly after rumors of a renewed extramarital affair emerged, but he's been trying to crowdfund his way back into the land of sweet tea and decoys for some time. The result: a kickstarter campaign that raised nearly $ 90,000, enough to pull off the initial fairfield operation and give hansen enough material to either show it as an online series or pitch to broadcast networks or digital platforms. Not that fairfield law enforcement was champing at the bit to serve as a sexual-predator stomping ground: online sex solicitation wasn't exactly plaguing fairfield, and deputy chief of police christopher lyddy didn't want to bring in that undesirable faction, per the new republic. \" at the end of the day we completely understood... That we really had a responsibility to become involved and to ensure this neighborhood was safe, \" lyddy says. By the end of the sting, lyddy's department nabbed 10 men on a variety of sex-related charges. He says hansen and his team were professional and that his force couldn't have pulled off the arrests so well without the show's technological help. Meanwhile, hansen tells the magazine, \" we just made that the safest neighborhood in america. \" ( read how the first installment went down, as well as about the show's critics and advocates. )",

Exxon mobil signed an expansion of its joint venture projects anyway, even after igor i. Sechin, rosneft's chief executive, was personally blacklisted in connection with the sanctions. The deal was legal, but exxon mobil was more fully constrained when tighter sanctions were imposed after russia was implicated that summer in the shooting down of malaysia airlines flight 17 over eastern ukraine. It has become increasingly clear in recent days that relations between the united states and russia are unlikely to improve any time soon. Mr. Tillerson has used increasingly tough talk to highlight the trump administration's differences with russia over its alliance with the syrian government. He has not suggested that any sanctions be lifted, and the administration has affirmed its commitment to the north atlantic treaty organization"

        "summary": "While viagra is the most popular erectile dysfunction treatment in the world — and there are an estimated 150 million men globally suffering from the disorder — it only strengthens an existing erection and cannot actually instigate one. Another potential treatment is in the works that doesn't incorporate drugs at all: it's gene therapy that involves exposure to blue light. Reporting last month in the journal angewandte chemie, researchers say that injecting a light-sensitive synthetic gene called an \" erectile optogenetic stimulator \" into the erectile tissue of rats ' penises allowed the creatures to achieve erections in as little as 37 seconds after being exposed to a blue light. Vice pulls a line from the paper that states the rats \" showed different levels of erectile response within 55 seconds upon exposure. \" in some cases, they were ultimately able to ejaculate, a press release notes. Cosmos reports that cells are slower to \" turn over \" in the penis as compared to other organs, but they do turn over, meaning men using this treatment would need to regularly inject themselves. \" injecting dna does sound kind of strange, \" researcher martin fussenegger tells cosmos, but thanks to ultra-thin needles, \" it wouldn't be as painful as people might think. \" as for the blue light the researchers used, it was just an ordinary lamp used to treat seasonal affective disorder. They ' ll next need to get the green light for human gene therapy trials, which the release notes would be \" highly expensive. \" even if the treatment proves successful in humans, viagra may not be entirely a thing of the past — when the little blue pill was paired with blue light gene therapy, the rats ' erections lasted longer.

( maring photography/getty images/contour by getty images ) former president bill clinton had a private telephone conversation in late spring with donald trump at the same time that the billionaire investor and reality-television star was nearing a decision to run for the white house, according to associates of both men. Four trump allies and one clinton associate familiar with the exchange said that clinton encouraged trump's efforts to play a larger role in the republican party and offered his own views of the political landscape. Clinton's personal office in new york confirmed that the call occurred in late may, but an aide to clinton said the 2016 race was never specifically discussed and that it was only a casual chat. The talk with clinton — the spouse of the democratic presidential front-runner and one of his party's preeminent political strategists — came just weeks before trump jumped into the gop race and surged to the front of the crowded republican field. The revelation of the call comes as many republicans have begun criticizing trump for his ties to democrats, including past financial donations to the clintons and their charitable foundation. 1 of 25 full screen autoplay close skip ad × people and groups donald"

        "summary": "More than 80 % of us soldiers'deaths between 2001 and 2011 were the result of blood loss and septicemia. There's limited time to save trauma victims experiencing significant blood loss — the so-called \" golden hour \" — and researchers at the university of alabama have been working for 19 years on a way to extend that time so that wounded soldiers and remote trauma victims are more likely to survive the long trip to a hospital. They think they've hit upon the secret ingredient — a synthetic version of the female sex hormone estrogen, and they've received a $ 10 million defense department grant to test it on humans. The breakthrough dates back to 1997 and is actually the result of a mistake. Researchers got an order of female mice instead of males; they almost didn't use the mice because of how much female hormone levels fluctuate, but they went ahead and were astonished to find that all of them resisted sepsis without any other treatment. When they tried it again with another batch of females it failed — because the mice were in a different part of their estrous cycles with lowered estrogen. After further testing, they found that synthetic estrogen also improves heart and liver function, even after 60 % blood loss, because it dilates blood vessels, moving fluid more efficiently, reports mental floss. The latest estrogen variant, ee-3-so4, helps prolong life for up to six hours post-trauma and could help not just trauma victims in general, but especially those with traumatic brain injuries.

        "summary": "Women sometimes get a bad rap for having a hard time deciding what to wear, but leave it to a uniform supplier to try to quantify just how much time they spend pondering outfits before heading out the door. A study of 2,000 women, commissioned by uk uniform supplier simon jersey, finds the average woman spends more than an hour per week — for a total of three days each year, or five months over a woman's working life from age 18 to 65 — choosing what to wear. It breaks down to about 12 minutes every workday morning, 10 minutes every weekend morning, and about 27.5 minutes before a night out. You think that's bad? half of women also worry about their outfit the night before or before getting out of bed in the morning. Even with all that planning, two-thirds of women admit to trying on multiple outfits before leaving the house; about 15 % have regretted their choice and returned to pick something else. It's no surprise, then, that about 25 % say they've arrived late to work because of deliberating what to wear. What's to consider, exactly? well, 37 % of women who say choosing an outfit is stressful cite concerns about whether their choice is suitable for work. Other worries relate to the dress code, weather, looks, and whether it's flattering. Simon jersey concludes uniforms could save time and stress; its survey doesn't explore how long men stand in front of the closet, but kiro 7 has a theory: \" they probably take just as long as women do. Maybe simon jersey doesn't have as many male uniforms to sell. \" ( see what women think about a lady in red. )",

The votes take place in silence, adds the bbc, with no debate allowed; if there's no consensus after three days, however, the cardinals may take a daylong break for prayer and informal discussion. The continued stalemate comes amid another black eye for the church, and a reminder of the deep challenges the next pope will face, adds reuters.

Mahony, who retired from leading the la diocese in 2011, is currently in the sistine chapel voting on the new pontiff. Meanwhile, president obama weighed in on the conclave in an interview airing this morning, reports politico. \" it seems to me that an american pope would preside just as effectively as a polish pope or an italian pope or a guatemalan pope, \" he said.

        "summary": "A federal judge on tuesday stopped the release of blueprints to make untraceable and undetectable 3d-printed plastic guns as president trump questioned whether his administration should have agreed to allow the plans to be posted online. The austin, texas-based company behind the plans, defense distributed, had reached a settlement with the federal government in june allowing it to make the plans for the guns available for download on wednesday. The restraining order from us district judge robert lasnik in seattle puts that plan on hold for now, the ap reports. Washington state attorney general bob ferguson called the ruling \" a complete, total victory. \" defense distributed blocked downloads from its site after the ruling, cnn reports. Judges in new york and new jersey issued similar rulings tuesday, usa today reports. \" we were asking for a nationwide temporary restraining order putting a halt to this outrageous decision by the federal government to allow these 3d downloadable guns to be available around our country and around the world. He granted that relief, \" ferguson said at a news conference. Eight democratic attorneys general had filed a lawsuit monday seeking to block the settlement. They also sought the restraining order, arguing the 3d guns would be a safety risk. Some plans had already been published online, however, and there are reports that thousands had already downloaded them. Congressional democrats have urged trump to reverse the decision to publish the plans, and some republicans have also expressed concern. The white house deputy press secretary told reporters tuesday it's already illegal to own or make \" wholly plastic \" guns in the us, and trump tweeted tuesday, \" i am looking into 3-d plastic guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to nra, doesn't seem to make much sense! \"",

One witness describes \" absolute chaos \" in the crowded mall when the shooting started, telling kgun, \" it was like what you see in a movie. \" another witness, who was at the restaurant for her daughter's 13th birthday and hid under a table, tells kold it was \" pretty harrowing. \" authorities say only one gun was used in the shooting, and some witnesses say the shooter eventually shot himself. The woman involved was hospitalized with a gunshot to the leg, and no bystanders were hurt.",

        "summary": "A federal judge in ohio filed a temporary restraining order friday against the trump campaign, as well as donald trump adviser roger stone, to prevent them from harassing or intimidating voters at the state's polling locations on election day, the ap reports. This comes after the trump campaign has encouraged supporters to be \" election observers \" and protect against fraud at the polls. Lawyers for democrats have filed lawsuits against republicans and the trump campaign in six states — arizona, michigan, new jersey, nevada, ohio, and pennsylvania — to prevent voter intimidation. But alleged voter suppression is also making the news elsewhere: the new york times released an oregon trail-like playable computer game called \" the voter suppression trail. \" the game's tagline: \" find out if your vote can survive the great, flawed adventure of american democracy. \" fake twitter ads are popping up encouraging voters to use a phone code to text their vote for hillary clinton, fortune reports. The ads, which appear to target black and latino voters specifically, claim to be paid for by the clinton campaign and include the slogans \" vote from home \" and \" avoid the line. \" vice looks at the history of voter fraud and suppression — going all the way back to edgar allen poe — and compares it to what's happening this year. The ap reports that 39 states allow citizens to challenge the eligibility of any voter at the polls, and only 15 of those states require proof from the challenger. These laws mean \" untrained private citizens could create chaos \" on tuesday. North carolina's version of the above law was called \" insane \" and \" like something that was put together in 1901 \" by a federal judge, according to vox. Voters whose eligibility is challenged by a random person must show up at a hearing to prove they can legally vote; people who don't have time or money to show up at a hearing have their eligibility stripped. So far 7,000 north carolina residents — a disproportionate number of them black — have been purged this way.",

The stamp can be traced back much further than dupont, though. Sotheby's notes a young stamp collector living in what is now guyana found it among his late uncle's letters in 1873. Since it was cut at the corners and a bit smudged, louis vernon vaughan sold it for six shillings, or about $ 1.50 at the time, to a dealer who reportedly said, \" i am taking a great risk in paying so much for this stamp and i hope you will appreciate my generosity. \" it had an estimated value of $ 40,000 by 1935, at which time vaughan said \" the world's greatest stamp dealers and philatelists are ready to outbid each other and pay ridiculous sums of money for that little scrap of paper that i once owned. \"",

Officials did not immediately confirm the identities of the two adults discovered sunday in rugged terrain near a popular trail in the desert park, the ap reports. But gilbert orbeso, who was with searchers when the discovery was made, told kesq-tv they are his son, joseph orbeso, 21, of lakewood and his girlfriend, rachel nguyen, 20, of westminster. \" i feel like we have closure. We know we found them. That was our main goal, to find them, \" said gilbert orbeso, who frequently joined the months-long search efforts that involved family members, friends, volunteers and law enforcement on the ground and in helicopters. Joseph orbeso and nguyen were reported missing july 28, after they failed to check out of their accommodations near the park. Authorities said a ping from joseph orbeso's cellphone had been recorded in the park the previous day. The couple's car was later found in the park. Temperatures topped 100 degrees in late july and it was unclear whether the couple had water and supplies with them. Daylight faded following the discovery sunday, so authorities planned to recover the bodies monday, said jodi miller, spokeswoman for the san bernardino county sheriff's department. Autopsies will determine the causes of death, she said. \" i believed that i was going to find them. I didn't know when, but i had my answer, \" gilbert orbeso told kesq. Per fox 11, the two bodies were found locked in an embrace. The couple's clothing, water bottles, and food wrappers were found nearby.",

And to show their distaste for \" pharma bro, \" wu-tang clan has dedicated a brand-new track on its new wu-tang: the saga continues album, coming out oct. 13, the guardian reports. \" lesson learn'd \" made its way onto soundcloud friday, a three-minute-plus song that reveals a brief clan diss toward shkreli and his much-maligned actions during his tenure as the price-gouging head of his pharmaceuticals company: \" hater/wouldn't last a day in my shoes/you know very well/bet he swell/you can tell he jeal ' /my price hikin ' like the pills martin shkreli sell. \" it's not the first time words have been exchanged between wu-tang members and shkreli, who recently is said to have sold the group's rare once upon a time in shaolin album for more than $ 1 million on ebay. Per the new york daily news, ghostface killah and shkreli got into it on social media in early 2016, culminating with an epic, nearly 12-minute-long video rant in which ghostface called shkreli a \" fake-ass super villain \" and \" peewee shkreli, \" among other names. And now, the \" rare \" wu-tang album shkreli is said to have hawked online may not be the deal he thought it would be: some are saying it may not be an authorized wu-tang album, while uproxx notes that other issues are holding up the deal even if it is a legit album, including shkreli's return behind bars after threatening hillary clinton and whispers that the winning bidder may have been in cahoots with shkreli to drive the price of the auction up.",

Many who perform in small theaters are raising their voices against their own union as it pushes for them to receive california's $ 9 minimum wage, the new york times reports. Often, such actors get no payment for rehearsals and perhaps just $ 7 per performance, the times notes. But that doesn't seem to bother them: a referendum found that 66 % of members of the actors ' equity union don't want small theaters to have to pay them minimum wage. The worry is that small theaters — those with 99 seats or fewer, which are currently allowed to pay actors just a stipend — could end up shutting their doors if forced to pay more. The low pay has helped the small-theater scene's big success in the area. \" you want to be up onstage, you want to work out the acting muscles, not sitting on your couch waiting for an audition, \" says actor tim robbins, who is in charge of a small theater. Actors ' equity is due to make a decision tomorrow on whether to require actors be paid minimum wage, though an actors ' committee has called on the union to postpone, playbill reports. Actor noah wyle, who is a producer in a small theater, makes a case in variety: \" keeping our doors open requires constant fundraising, grant writing and, above all, volunteerism, \" he notes. \" call it ' love of the craft, ' esprit de corps or old-fashioned apprenticeship, we've survived because of a consensus of understanding: we are here to make theater, not money. \" but not everyone agrees. \" it's so weird to be doing the work and not get paid, and it's totally unsustainable, \" says another actor.",

Lindsey graham, another republican on the committee, also said sunday that ford should be heard by the committee, if that is what she wants. Ford's lawyer told cnn on monday that her client is willing to testify before the committee. \" the answer is yes, \" debra katz says. Responded white house rep kellyanne conway: \" she should be heard. \" a vote is scheduled for thursday. Republicans have an 11 to 10 majority on the committee, meaning that if flake won't vote to advance the nomination, it will be stalled unless a democrat votes in favor. Sen. Bob corker, a republican not on the committee, has also called for a delay in the wake of the accusations, which kavanaugh has denied. Republicans had hoped to have kavanaugh confirmed by oct. 1, but senate democrats say a delay in voting is now essential, the washington post reports. \" to railroad a vote now would be an insult to the women of america and the integrity of the supreme court, \" senate minority leader chuck schumer said in a statement.

Born at the san francisco zoo on july 4, 1971, koko was chosen as an infant to work with psychologist francine \" penny \" patterson on a language research project. Her knowledge of sign language offered a window into a gorilla's emotions, such as her affection for her pet kitten and her grief when robin williams, whom she once met, died. The gorilla foundation, which studied her, announced her passing thursday, reuters reports. She died at the foundation's preserve in california's santa cruz mountains, the ap reports. Koko was twice featured on the cover of national geographic, including one cover image she snapped of herself; had multiple books written about her; and was featured in several documentaries. She was also the subject of much research — in addition to knowing sign language, for example, scientists studied her and found that apes may be closer to speaking than had previously been though. She learned to play the recorder in 2012, showing that she could control her breathing, which until then primates weren't believed able to do. She was said to understand some spoken english as well as signs. She even once took part in an \" interspecies chat \" on the internet.

The state's seven-way republican us senate primary is down to two candidates and it's still too close to call between attorney ovide lamontagne and former state attorney general kelly ayotte, the boston globe reports. The new hampshire race is another one seen as tea party versus establishment, though this one's not as clear cut, notes chris cillizza in the washington post. Lamontagne billed himself as ultra-conservative and played up his connection to tea party groups in the final weeks of the rice, but sarah palin and other top conservatives backed ayotte, who currently holds a lead narrow enough for lamontagne to legally call for a recount.",

            "Concord, n.h. — conservative attorney ovide lamontagne and former attorney general kelly ayotte were still waiting wednesday to learn which of them will be new hampshire's republican u.s. Senate nominee. Paula penney, elections assistant at the secretary of state's office, said returns were still coming in and that staff had been working on counting them throughout the night. Ayotte held a slight lead -- close enough for lamontagne to legally request a recount if the margin held -- with 257 of 301 precincts reporting, or 85 percent. Ayotte had 46,331 votes, or 38 percent, while lamontagne had 45,352, or 37 percent. Multimillionaire businessman bill binnie, who spent more than $ 5 million out of his own pocket pushing his jobs agenda, received 16,960 votes, or 14 percent, and conceded along with millionaire businessman jim bender, who got 10,507 votes, or 9 percent. Lamontagne, who painted himself as the only true conservative in the race, held a slight advantage in early returns over ayotte -- former alaska gov. Sarah palin's pick for the seat. But as tuesday night wore on, ayotte took a slight lead. The winner hopes to win retiring gop sen. Judd gregg's seat and face democratic nominee paul hodes, who was unopposed. Losers in state primary elections can ask for a recount if the losing margin is within 1.5 percent of the total votes cast in a race. Penney said no recount request had been made yet; candidates have until 5 p.m. Wednesday to make the request. Hodes said tuesday night the republican agenda is \" extreme, radical and right wing. \" he said republicans would take the country backward into the hole from which the nation is struggling to dig out. \" i ' m running for the people of new hampshire. I don't have to run against anyone, \" hodes said. Ayotte, 42, of nashua, won the blessing from palin, who calls her a \" granite grizzly. \" ayotte spent more than $ 2 million on her anti-democrat, anti-federal spending campaign. Lamontagne closed fast in the final days of the race despite spending only $ 400,000. Lamontagne, 52, counted on conservative groups, not money, to win the nomination. \" it's not how much money you have, it's the message, \" lamontagne said tuesday night.

When noah kravitz left phonedog, he changed the name on the account and kept its 17,000 followers. The company says kravitz owes it $ 2.50 per follower over 8 months, amounting to $ 340,000. Phonedog argues that the twitter followers are essentially a list of customers. But kravitz says the company didn't raise the issue until after he sued them over unpaid wages. Plus, twitter followers are often \" people who are just gathering accounts and broadcasting their own content — people who aren't necessarily paying attention to anything phonedog has to say, \" notes an intellectual property lawyer. Kravitz's attorney thinks $ 2.50 is too much. \" if that's the case, kim kardashian's account would probably be worth billions of dollars of year, \" he says.",

A lawsuit filed in arizona on wednesday by the center for biological diversity and us rep.

        "summary": "Scientists are \" very, very excited \" about what they see as a positive \" first step \" in developing a blood test that could detect a variety of cancers, the washington post reports. In a study published in the journal science, researchers used the cancerseek test, which looks for cancer-tied proteins and dna, on 1,005 patients who'd already been diagnosed, and they found about 70 % of eight different cancers: breast, colon, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, and liver, with hits highest for ovarian cancer ( 98 % ), per mit technology review. When 812 patients without cancer were also given this \" liquid biopsy, \" only seven false positives ( less than 1 % ) popped up. In many of the cases, the test was even able to pinpoint the cancer origin site to just one or two locations, a help in reducing the number of unnecessary follow-up tests. Scientists are especially hopeful about how well the tests did in picking up on cancers that don't have screening tests for those not at high risk, including ovarian and liver. However, while some are \" enormously excited \" about what they say would be the \" holy grail \" of cancer screening, per the bbc, they agree much more work is needed before this test is found in an oncologist's office. For one, the test didn't do as well with the earliest-stage cancers — the success rate for those was only about 40 %, which means it would miss those types of cancers much more than it finds them, npr points out. And a larger-scale study that tests people who haven't yet been diagnosed with any cancer is also needed. \" we've come about one step in a thousand-mile journey, \" a researcher not involved with the study says. ( this type of test has been a longtime goal for scientists. )",

The authors of the study titled \" faces of facebook: privacy in the age of augmented reality \" — alessandro acquisti, ralph gross and fred stutzman — demonstrated it at the black hat technical security conference, which was july 30 to august 4 in las vegas. They used publicly available data — photos from facebook profiles of students — and then used face recognition technology to recognize these students as they look into a web camera. The results? using a database of 25,000 photos taken from facebook profiles, the authors ' face recognition software correctly identified 31 percent of the students after fewer than three ( on average ) quick comparisons. In another test, the authors took photos from 277,978 facebook profiles and compared them to nearly 6,000 profiles from an unnamed dating web site, managing to identify approximately 10 percent of the site's members. The study raises important questions about our privacy. Online, you can make steps to hide your real identity such as changing your name",
            "Carnegie mellon researcher demonstrates a new facebook privacy threat: profile photos can be used to id people on dating sites and on the street. Carnegie mellon's alessandro acquisti shows how to use facebook to id people on dating sites and on the street ( credit: declan mccullagh/cnet ) las vegas -- facebook's online privacy woes are well-known. But here's an offline one: its massive database of profile photos can be used to identify you as you're walking down the street. A carnegie mellon university researcher today described how he assembled a database of about 25,000 photographs taken from students ' facebook profiles. Then he set up a desk in one of the campus buildings and asked willing volunteers to peer into webcams. The results: facial recognition software put a name to the face of 31 percent of the students after, on average, less than three seconds of rapid-fire comparisons. In a few years, \" facial visual searches may become as common as today's text-based searches, \" says alessandro acquisti, who presented his work in collaboration with ralph gross and fred stutzman at the black hat computer security conference here. As a proof of concept, the carnegie mellon researchers also developed an iphone app that can take a photograph of someone, pipe it through facial recognition software, and then display on-screen that"

It started with a simple fight; a pair of off-duty cops handling security tried to step in, but the fight just got bigger as some 80 people joined in, myfoxny reports. Before the police, having called in additional law enforcement, finally got a handle on things, hundreds of people were shouting and pushing each other. Eventually, officers from several nearby communities took on the crowd; authorities spent 45 minutes getting people out of the venue in middletown, nj. Two people, a 32-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman, were arrested and both charged with disorderly conduct.

        "summary": "Hope for bald men? perhaps. A study suggests that plucking out one's hair could actually trigger the growth of even more. But before anyone starts tearing at his scalp, know that the plucking process has to be done in a specific way — and has thus far only been tested on mice, the guardian reports. Still, the results, published in the journal cell, are promising. Scientists say they involve the way hair follicles communicate with each other. The removal of the hair, done right, causes a \" distress \" signal in the body that leads to an immune response; the body is essentially told to start growing more hair, the guardian reports. The process worked when mouse hairs were individually removed from a dense patch, a circular area of between 3 and 5 millimeters. In such cases, when 200 hairs were plucked, up to 1,300 grew back — with some even sprouting up outside the plucked area. But when 200 hairs were removed across an area whose diameter was more than 6 millimeters, none returned. The researchers believe that's because the follicle signaling doesn't work across such a wide space. The bbc adds that more isn't more, in this case: the researchers tested pulling out every hair from a specified area, but found that while those hairs grew back, there was no additional growth. The researchers caution the experiments need to be carried out on bald men, and the guardian notes that even if the approach does work on humans, it would only help balding men who still had the required amount of hair density. The findings are among the first to point to such group signaling, or quorum sensing, in animal cells, as opposed to bacteria, scientific american reports.

A chemical signaling system called quorum sensing allows those single-celled bugs to detect when their numbers have multiplied enough to mount an effective attack or emit glowing light. Yet decades after scientists learned about this brainless bacterial coordination a research team has uncovered new evidence suggesting animal cells may speak the same lingo. These new hints were revealed through an unexpected approach — plucking hairs. When a researcher at the university of southern california and his colleagues plucked 200 hairs from mice in a specific pattern in a confined area — ensuring that many neighboring hairs were pulled — more than 1,000 hairs grew back in their place, including some beyond the plucked region.

        "summary": "Espn personality bill simmons posted a long, soul-searching apology yesterday, in the wake of a massive internet backlash over a piece his grantland site ran last wednesday that outed a woman as transgender in the wake of her suicide — a suicide that may have been linked to the reporting of that piece. If you've missed the uproar, here are the cliff's notes: the original piece: writer caleb hannan's \" dr. V's magical putter \" tells the story of a quirky putter and dr. Essay anne vanderbilt, the physicist who designed it — only hannan discovers that vanderbilt's credentials don't check out, and that she is a trans woman. \" what began as a story about a brilliant woman with a new invention had turned into the tale of a troubled man who had invented a new life for himself, \" hannan writes in one of the piece's more cringe-worthy paragraphs. The last time they spoke, vanderbilt lashed out at hannan, telling him he was about to commit a \" hate crime. \" hannan also outs vanderbilt to one of her investors, something for which he's been criticized extensively. The piece ends with the revelation that vanderbilt killed herself oct. 18. The reaction: at first, the piece was widely praised by a host of major sports writers, like dan le betard, bill barnwell, and richard deitsch, who said it might be the \" best i've read this month, \" according to the big lead. But on friday, a wave of criticism started popping up, castigating hannan for his callousness. Melissa mcewan at shakesville called it \" one of the most cavalier, irresponsible pieces of journalism i have read in a very long time. \" you can read more reactions at the toast. The apology: simmons explains that his staff simply wasn't educated enough on trans issues to see the problems. \" we read every incarnation of that piece through a certain lens. … once a few people nudged us and said, hey, read it this way instead, you transphobic dumbasses, that lens looked totally different, \" he writes. \" we made an indefensible mistake not to solicit input from anyone in the trans community. \" grantland also ran a piece from espn baseball writer christina kahrl, a trans woman, calling hannan's story \" a permanent exhibit of what not to do, and how not to treat a fellow human being. \" the reaction to the reaction: tim marchman at deadspin calls simmons ' apology \" characteristically self-obsessed, \" and writes that, like grantland itself, it's more interested",

The los angeles times puts it this way: \" in a region where brush fires are a way of life, the scene on the main route to las vegas was surreal. \" tv news helicopters flew overhead as the abandoned vehicles, including two big rigs, burned. \" i've never seen anything like this before, \" says california highway patrol officer steve carapia.

        "summary": "\" we are in discussions with legislative leaders this weekend to see if there's a way to clarify the intent of the law. \" that from indiana gov. Mike pence, who yesterday spoke to the indianapolis star about the religious freedom restoration act. And in an appearance on abc's this week this morning, he cleared up some things but not others. Abc news reports that pence said the controversial bill, signed into law on thursday, would not be changing and that signing it was \" absolutely not \" a mistake. While he cited the \" tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding \" around the bill, he didn't answer a number of questions from george stephanopoulos ( \" just yes or no? \" he pressed ) as to whether the law does indeed do what its critics say it does: let business owners — in stephanopoulos ' hypothetical, a christian florist — refuse service to gays. Pence and supporters have pointed to similar laws on the books in 19 other states, with the governor noting that then-state sen. Barack obama voted in favor of illinois'version. Abc news points out illinois has since enacted specific legal protection for gays, something pence told stephanopoulos was \" not on his agenda. \" as the interview wrapped up, stephanopoulos tried one last time, asking, \" do you think it should be legal in the state of indiana to discriminate against gays or lesbians? \" he wanted a yes or no, which pence wouldn't give. \" hoosiers don't believe in discrimination, \" said pence. Pressed again for a yes or no, pence said, \" what i am for is protecting... The religious liberty of hoosiers. \" meanwhile, angie's list has put a planned $ 40 million expansion of its indianapolis headquarters on ice, and the mayor of seattle announced all city-funded trips to indiana were to cease.",

The latest: he's being investigated after his neighbor accused him of battery, tmz reports. Sources say biebs and the neighbor got into a big argument yesterday morning, and the neighbor says justin made physical contact and threatened him during it. The singer's crew says the fight was over loud parties bieber's friends were throwing at his place while justin was on tour, but neighbors say it actually had to do with justin racing his ferrari up and down the street. Multiple residents of the neighborhood tell tmz he drives recklessly there, as fast as 100mph. And on monday, bieber was shirtless yet again... In an airport this time. The daily mail has disturbing pictures of him with no shirt and his pants tugged toward his ankles, revealing almost all of his white underwear, as he walked through security at a poland airport. He was leaving the country after a concert there, and he stripped while in the car before even entering the airport, reuters reports. An airport spokesperson says he was not asked to remove his clothing. The mail notes that he has been \" stripping at almost every opportunity \" of late, despite the fact that it's very cold ( it was 14 degrees in poland ); it offers photographic evidence.",

Jezebel has the backstory: a company called demand protest recently started claiming it was actually behind large protests in the us and had staged those protests. Its website offered to pay $ 50 per hour, plus a retainer and health benefits, to people willing to protest the trump inauguration. While some right-wing media outlets were suspicious ( infowars noted it wasn't clear whether the company was legitimate ), others were gleeful, per jezebel. Washington times, for example, originally led its article on the company with, \" there may really be such a thing as a professional protester. \" fox, however, was skeptical. As jezebel points out, demand protest's website was created dec. 2, well after the 2016 election was over — despite the fact that the website claimed the company had worked on behalf of \" 2016 presidential campaigns. \" there was also the fact that a san francisco phone number listed for the company did not work. Finally, carlson had the supposed director of operations for the company, dom tullipso, on for an interview. \" so, this is a sham, \" carlson started things off. He went on to add that the name \" dom tullipso \" does not exist, to which the supposed tullipso responded that his real name is dominic tullipso. The entire, bizarre interview is absolutely worth a watch; it ends with tullipso coming this close to a confession: \" it's pretty darn easy these days to just say whatever the heck you want on national tv and have it passed off as truth, and it's pretty incredible to me how easy it was to get the coverage we got. \"",
