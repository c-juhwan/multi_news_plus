        "summary": "Seven rail cars are scheduled to pull into alaska on thursday, and they ' ll be packed with a precious commodity one wouldn't think anchorage would need: snow for the famous iditarod dog-sled race that begins saturday, the alaska dispatch news reports. \" it's no secret that warm temperatures for days on end have further eroded what little snow cover existed on the trail system here in anchorage, \" a statement from the event's ceo says. The snow is being lugged in from a rail yard hundreds of miles away in fairbanks, per an alaska railroad spokesman. Anchorage has enjoyed unseasonably balmier temps this winter ( the national weather service says the city got just 1.8 inches of fresh snow in february, compared with a typical 10.9 inches, per cbs news ) and all the existing snow has melted, nbc news notes. \" the railroad is saving our behinds, \" says the director of fur rendezvous, the huge winter festival that runs alongside the iditarod and also needs snow for its events. But even the imported mush material won't be enough to keep the entire ceremonial start route for the race intact: an iditarod press release notes that the usual 11-mile path has been shortened to just 3 miles. ( boston could've helped out with the snow if this winter had been like last year's. )",

And the city's stockpile of snow has melted after weeks over above freezing weather.

The mercury is expected to hit an unseasonably high of 43 degrees and there is no snow in the forecast. Luckily, there's snow on the ground.

        "summary": "White people are roughly twice as likely to die from prescription painkillers as black people in the us; now a new study finds that they're also twice as likely to be prescribed them. It's just the latest finding to show that minorities are treated differently when it comes to pain management, reports the new york times. \" we've done a good job documenting that these disparities exist, \" says pain researcher salimah meghani at the university of pennsylvania. \" we have not done a good job doing something about them. \" specifically, the researchers report in the journal plos one that, based on 60 million records of pain-related adult emergency department visits between 2007 and 2011, blacks with conditions that are not easily diagnosed — i.e. Back and abdominal pain — were half as likely to be prescribed opioids compared to whites with the same woes. Study authors add that when conditions are definitive, such as bone fractures and kidney stones, the disparity went away. One ethicist says this is because black people are too often seen as \" drug seekers and overall exaggerators. \" the researchers say there are \" important implications for medical provider education \" to help them overcome biases. Meanwhile, the guardian reports that exacerbating the disparity is that only 4 % of physicians in the us are black, and that there were fewer black men in med school in 2014 than in 1978. \" if you don't have that culture of diversity in your training and in your development, when will you get it? \" one advocate asks. Not, he suggests, \" until someone sues you. \" ( this former addict says he was prescribed opioids way too easily. )",

So say researchers at the london school of economics and erasmus mc, who studied the effects of these four types of activities on the mental health of 9,000 europeans aged 50 and older. Reporting in the american journal of epidemiology, they also found that some activities, like joining a community organization like a political group, appear to result in less happiness in the long run. \" the church appears to play a very important social role in keeping depression at bay and also as a coping mechanism during periods of illness in later life, \" says epidemiologist dr mauricio avendano, who notes religious activities were the only type to contribute to sustained happiness. Researchers admit the study's sample size is small, and they were not investigating why but rather whether these four types of activities influence happiness. They do not note whether people in the study were new to these activities or whether there was crossover between them, but they do posit a few theories. \" it is not clear to us how much this is about religion per se, or whether it may be about the sense of belonging and not being socially isolated, \" says avendano, who adds that this participation can influence lifestyle choices, reports the oregonian. As for political organizations, he says: \" participants receive a higher sense of reward when they first join an organization, but if it involves a lot of effort and they don't get much in return, the benefits may wear off after some time. \" ( here's what 53,000 kids say about happiness. )",

We used lagged individual fixed-effects models based on data from 9,068 persons aged ≥50 years in wave 1 ( 2004/2005 ), wave 2 ( 2006/2007 ), and wave 4 ( 2010/2011 ) of the survey of health, ageing and retirement in europe ( share ). After we controlled for a wide set of confounders, increased participation in religious organizations predicted a decline in depressive symptoms ( euro-d scale; possible range, 0 – 12 ) 4 years later ( β = −0.190 units, 95 % confidence interval: −0.365, −0.016 ), while participation in political/community organizations was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms ( β = 0.222 units, 95 % confidence interval: 0.018, 0.428 ). There were no significant differences between european regions in these associations. Our findings suggest that social participation is associated with depressive symptoms, but the direction and strength of the association depend on the type of social activity.

            "Abstract we examined whether changes in different forms of social participation were associated with changes in depressive symptoms in older europeans. We used lagged individual fixed-effects models based on data from 9,068 persons aged ≥50 years in wave 1 ( 2004/2005 ), wave 2 ( 2006/2007 ), and wave 4 ( 2010/2011 ) of the survey of health, ageing and retirement in europe ( share ). After we controlled for a wide set of confounders, increased participation in religious organizations predicted a decline in depressive symptoms ( euro-d scale; possible range, 0 – 12 ) 4 years later ( β = −0.190 units, 95 % confidence interval: −0.365, −0.016 ), while participation in political/community organizations was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms ( β = 0.222 units, 95 % confidence interval: 0.018, 0.428 ). There were no significant differences between european regions in these associations. Our findings suggest that social participation is associated with depressive symptoms, but the direction and strength of the association depend on the type of social activity. Participation in religious organizations may offer mental health benefits beyond those offered by other forms of social participation.",

In the video, coleman is critical of her abductors and both the american and canadian governments as she pleads for an end to their \" kafkaesque nightmare, \" reports the ap.

A senior taliban official says the video was released by the affiliated haqqani network, which is seeking the release of three members. One is a commander named anas haqqani, who is in the custody of the afghan government and has been sentenced to death, per the new york times. Coleman says her family will be harmed if the sentence is carried out. \" they really will not settle this until they get what they are demanding, \" says her husband in the video.",

        "summary": "It turns out that when you make it easier to buy guns, more people wind up getting killed with guns. That's the conclusion researchers from john hopkins university came to after studying the effects of missouri's 2007 repeal of its \" permit-to-purchase \" law, which required a local sheriff to vet would-be gun owners before they could buy their weapon. Researchers believe this move was \" associated with an additional 55 to 63 murders per year \" over the next five years, they announced. That jump \" did not happen with homicides that did not involve guns; it did not occur to any neighboring state; the national trend was doing the opposite — it was trending downward, \" the study's lead author tells the bbc. Researchers say they also controlled for factors such as unemployment, poverty rates, burglaries, incarceration, policing, and other state laws. More criminals got their hands on guns as well; the number of handguns being recovered from crime scenes shortly after crimes doubled. But barbara shelly at the kansas city star expects the study to fall on deaf ears in missouri's legislature. \" they favor a vigorous gun market, and no amount of research or evidence is going to convince them otherwise. \" indeed, the state senate last week endorsed a bill that would nullify all federal gun laws.",

            "A change in missouri gun policy that passed with relatively little attention seven years ago caught the eye of a team of researchers, who now say the change was responsible for an uptick in violent crimes in the state, including an additional 60 or so homicides a year. Led by daniel webster, director of the johns hopkins center for gun policy and research, the team tracked crime in missouri following the repeal in 2007 of a longstanding law requiring a sheriffs permit to purchase a concealable gun, including for private sales. Sheriffs departments had up to seven days to review a permit application and conduct a criminal background check. Gun advocates argued at the time that the sheriffs review was redundant and bothersome. They noted that federal law requires licensed gun dealers to do background checks on their customers, and missouri law requires a permit to carry a concealed weapon. But the repeal of the permit-to-purchase law enabled guns to change hands in private sales with no permit or check. And once that happened, researchers say, gun violence and murders increased throughout the state. The full study, to be reported in the journal of urban health, isnt out yet. But advance news reports indicate that the study was thorough and accounted for a number of variables, including policing levels, incarceration rates, burglary trends, jobless rates and poverty.",

The study, to be published in a forthcoming issue of journal of urban health, finds that the law's repeal was associated with an additional 55 to 63 murders per year in missouri between 2008 and 2012.

The analyses controlled for changes in policing, incarceration, burglaries, unemployment, poverty, and other state laws adopted during the study period that could affect violent crime. The increase in murders with firearms in missouri began in the first full year after the ptp handgun law was repealed when data from crime gun traces revealed simultaneous large increases in the number of guns diverted to criminals and in guns purchased in missouri that were subsequently recovered by police in border states that retained their ptp laws. \" this study provides compelling confirmation that weaknesses in firearm laws lead to deaths from gun violence, \" said daniel webster, scd,"

        "summary": "For four days, baloo was missing from her family's nova scotia home. The feline is now back, but not before she took a 1,500-mile round trip, half of it in a box. Jacqueline lake tells the cbc that when her family's tabby cat first vanished, she suspected he'd slipped out the front door when her kids went to school one morning. After an exhaustive search around the neighborhood, however, another nagging thought entered lake's mind: she'd shipped tire rims to a friend in alberta on dec. 6 and now wondered if baloo had crawled inside one of the boxes before she sealed it. Sure enough, the following monday, four days after baloo disappeared, a call came in from the purolator courier company, which said the cat had emerged in montreal. Purolator tapped the local spca, which managed to tie baloo to his family in dartmouth. Volunteers with an animal rescue and transport company stepped up to drive baloo all the way back home on saturday. Lake, who now recalls one of the boxes she'd sent out was 10 pounds heavier than the others ( she chalked it up to a defect with the rim ), marvels that baloo was able to sneak into the box without her noticing and stay so quiet during the mailing process. \" the cat never made a sound, \" she says, per global news. \" i ' m telling you, he was in stealth mode. \" lake says the spca treated baloo \" like royalty \" and has microchipped him in case he ever finds himself outside the dartmouth area again. Lake's daughter is glad he's now back home, but when they found out what had happened, she had one question for her mom: \" why did you mail my cat? \" ( this isn't the first time a cat has gone postal. )",

        "summary": "Donald trump has long pooh-poohed any ties between his campaign and the kremlin that might be working to undermine the presidential election. But according to officials from two of america's european allies, some of the us ' nato partners have become \" alarmed \" at trump's dismissive attitude toward moscow, particularly regarding russia's likely role in recent email hackings, per a long read by kurt eichenwald for newsweek. These officials say that trump's comments ( which a british official calls \" quite disturbing \" ) have caused consternation for a variety of reasons, including that they have caused these european partners to fear trump maybe doesn't understand the information he's getting in intelligence briefings, doesn't believe that info, chooses not to prioritize it — or, more ominously, because he may be \" misleading the american public for unknown reasons, \" eichenwald writes. Also raising eyebrows, among others, are former trump campaign manager paul manafort ( who had murky ties with ukraine ) and retired lt. Gen. Michael flynn, once thought to be in the running for trump's vp slot, who keeps making appearances with the rt russian news agency. These concerns, exacerbated by trump's own \" glowing statements about putin, \" have made some of these overseas nations afraid that under a president trump, the us would no longer stand with them against moscow. \" for perhaps the first time since wwii, countries in western europe fear that the american election, should trump win, could trigger events that imperil their national security and do potentially irreparable harm to the alliances that have kept the continent safe for decades, \" eichenwald writes.

        "summary": "The 31-mile \" chunnel \" connecting england to mainland europe was no small engineering feat, but switzerland has stepped up the game. On june 1, it will begin testing trains in the world's longest, deepest tunnel — and the $ 12 billion gotthard base tunnel cuts through solid rock as deep as 7,500 feet beneath the alps and runs a whopping 35.5 miles long, reports nbc news. \" it is an incredible project, a huge achievement, \" says geotechnical engineer claire smith, editor of britain's ground engineering magazine. Allowing passenger trains to travel up to 155mph, the twin tunnels ( one for each direction ) should reduce travel times between zurich and milan from four-plus hours to 2.5, not to mention reduce pollution as it shifts traffic from trucks to trains and more than doubles the hauling capacity on the region's north-south freight corridor to at least 44 million tons. The whole project, which now surpasses japan's 33.5-mile seikan tunnel as the world's longest, took 17 years to build and cost the equivalent of the 2012 london olympics, as swiss info reports, as well as the lives of eight of the 2,600 workers. The giant boring machines themselves were as long as four soccer fields. German chancellor angela merkel, french president françois hollande, and italian pm matteo renzi will gather at a ritzy ceremony to inaugurate the new route, which is set to open to passengers in december. It isn't until 2020, however, that the tunnel's full benefits will be realized when an opening at ceneri allows trains to haul tractor-trailers as tall as 13 feet, reports the rail journal. For american comparisons, the tunnel houses enough concrete to span the height of 84 empire state buildings, and is roughly 20 times longer than boston's 1.5-mile \" tip \" o ' neill tunnel. ( speaking of world records, mt. Everest doesn't even break the 20 tallest mountains in the world using this metric. )",

            "Swiss federal railways ( sbb ) has unveiled plans to improve the performance of international passenger services on the gotthard route, which with punctuality of 82 % are 7 % below the national average. According to sbb, delays are primarily caused by rolling stock faults, late arrival of trains from italy, and works associated with the upgrading of the line. Sbb plans to spend sfr 12.9m ( $ us 19.5m ) by 2018 on modifications to its fleet of etr 610 pendolino trains to improve the reliability of traction and tilt systems. A joint task force will also be established with italian state railways ( fs ) to address factors contributing to delays on the italian side of the border. Passenger information will also be improved. One problem has already been dealt with: after a spate of delays caused by the introduction of etcs on the brunnen-erstfeld and pollegio-castione stretches, the situation has now stablised. However, there are still issues concerning the operation of onboard etcs equipment on different vehicle types, and sbb says it is working \" intensively \" with suppliers to rectify these problems. On the infrastructure side, sbb plans to increase weekend and overnight engineering possessions instead of imposing temporary speed restrictions. Even after the opening of the gotthard base tunnel in december sbb will still be under pressure, with works continuing at around 25 locations along the gotthard",

Researchers found that people who downed four cups a day have a 20 % lower risk of developing malignant melanoma, which cbs news notes is the fifth most common cause of cancer in the us and the deadliest form of skin cancer. The study crunched data from 447,000 adults who were tracked over 10 years. The more coffee they drank, the less likely they were to develop melanoma. The scientists from the national cancer institute at the national institutes of health and the yale school of public health emphasize that this \" modest \" decrease in risk obviously doesn't mean coffee drinkers can skip the sunblock, reports the la times. The study shows only a link, not a cause-and-effect, and researchers can't say for sure what's going on.

Police say that a homeowner in wallace, shoshone county, went to check on his barking dog yesterday evening and spotted 48-year-old roy bieluch, whom authorities had warned could be armed and dangerous, kxly reports. The homeowner ordered bieluch to stay where he was and opened fire with a handgun when the inmate moved toward him. Bieluch was apprehended and taken to a medical center with a gunshot wound to the leg. Police say the inmate, who was awaiting trial on charges including burglary and is believed to have links to the aryan nations, walked out of the lightly staffed jail's front door tuesday night after making his way through a crawlspace, reports khq. Bieluch's fiancé was arrested on wednesday on charges of helping him after the escape and is now being held in the same jail he broke out of, an earlier kxly story reported.",

During a coroner's inquest, a veterinary toxicologist testified that high levels of the drug and of morphine were found in the urine of the staffordshire bull terrier named major following the march attack, which was witnessed by a bbc crew filming a series about drugs, per the guardian. Mario perivoitos had begun having a seizure when major reportedly attacked, crushing his owner's larynx and causing loss of blood. A producer intervened, but 41-year-old perivoitos died later at a hospital. A coroner said perivoitos had also taken cocaine and was likely \" experiencing an epileptic shock, which caused the dog to nip his face before biting his neck, \" per the mirror. It is \" likely that this attack happened because this dog had taken cocaine … up to 48 hours before, but it may have been much shorter than that, \" the guardian and evening times quote the veterinary toxicologist as saying. \" it is almost impossible to say whether that will make the dog attack but it does make them respond abnormally. \" detective chief inspector luke marks told the court that the dog was taken to a police facility following the attack and \" was due to be destroyed but i do not know if it has been. \"",

But sterling has in fact received an naacp award in the past, deadspin notes, despite a history of alarming comments. He got the award in 2009, with the los angeles naacp branch president citing his \" unique history of giving to the children of la, \" per the los angeles times. Meanwhile, a range of outlets are digging into the history of the man who, the new york times notes, has been called \" the worst owner in professional sports. \" among the stories from the times: the clippers ' health insurance wouldn't cover a $ 70,000 prostate cancer surgery for then-assistant coach kim hughes in 2004. Ex-clippers gm elgin baylor said sterling's goal was \" a southern plantation-type structure. \" and describing a relationship with a mistress whom he consulted on hiring, he testified, \" it was purely sex for money … i probably didn't tell my wife. \" when a federal lawsuit accused him of pushing minorities and families with kids out of his apartment buildings, he settled for $ 2.7 million, the times notes. In the housing lawsuit, he was quoted as saying, \" hispanics smoke, drink, and just hang around the building, \" while \" black tenants smell and attract vermin, \" the washington post reports. He also faced a 1996 lawsuit for sexual harassment, the paper notes. Deadspin offers a lengthy list of similar quotes. The los angeles times describes the suit filed by sterling's wife, rochelle, against v. Stiviano, the woman allegedly at the other end of the racist recording. In the suit, to which the team has pointed in the current controversy, rochelle sterling calls on stiviano to give up a $ 1.8 million apartment and $ 500,000 worth of cars; sterling's wife says he gave the items without her knowledge — even though the money belongs to them jointly. Part of stiviano's response in a court document: \" this is an action brought by a very angry wife whose husband is a highly public figure and who is well known to be ' keeping women ' other than his wife and who has done so for very many years with a big toothy grin brandishing his sexual prowess in the faces of the paparazzi ( sic ). \" interestingly, stiviano contends that sterling has never been her boyfriend — at least according to tmz sources.",

So she cooked up a highly indulgent thanksgiving meal, including 6 ounces of turkey with crispy skin ( 299 calories ), sausage stuffing ( 310 ), and a well-buttered dinner roll ( 310 ). Then came a fattening sweet-potato casserole ( 300 ), mashed with gravy and butter ( 140 ), and a few greens and cranberry sauce ( 208 ). Dessert was killer, naturally, with pumpkin pie ( 316 ), pecan pie ( 503 ), and whipped cream ( 100 ). But that came to just 2,486 calories. Sure, wine and a hefty breakfast could fill in the rest, but stomach size and nausea would make that a toughy. So the 4,500-count may well be an exaggeration that \" diet food companies would like us to believe, \" writes parker-pope. But make no mistake: your heart and gall bladder will still suffer from indulgent eating. Click for parker-pope's full blog.",

That according to new research that has found that cats, dogs, and select other animals may be able to see things that are invisible to the human eye. That's because they're able to see uv light, according to a paper published in the proceedings of the royal society b. While we've known for a century that many invertebrates ( discovery news gives bees as an example ) see uv, it has long been assumed that the majority of mammals had lenses like our own, which block uv from reaching the retina, says study co-author ronald douglas. The researchers came to a new conclusion by reviewing the eyes of dead mammals, then measuring how much light passed through the lens to the retina. Livescience reports some animals ' lenses permitted some uv light to pass through, indicating they can detect uv. As for what they're privy to that we're not, it's both appetizing and not: patterns on flowers that reveal the presence of nectar, and a urine-marked landscape. Those sights would be put to good use: the urine trails could signal the presence of prey, for instance. As far as predators go, reindeer are able to see polar bears against snow when a human might not, as snow reflects uv, and white fur doesn't, explains douglas. So add reindeer to the list, along with rodents, hedgehogs, bats, ferrets, and okapis. ( in other animal news, an ancient dog graveyard has been unearthed. )",

        "summary": "It's an interesting bar bet for armchair historians: name the worst year in human history. For harvard medieval historian michael mccormack, the smart money is on 536. \" it was the beginning of one of the worst periods to be alive, if not the worst year, \" he tells science. Start with the then-mysterious fog that descended over europe, the middle east, and asia — and stayed for 18 months. Not only was it dark and freezing pretty much all the time, the resulting crop failure led to mass starvation. A team led by mccormick and a glaciologist now think the fog can be blamed on the eruption of a volcano in iceland, one that blew again in 540 and 547. The fog helped give the decade following 536 the unwanted distinction of being the coldest in 2,300 years, but it was only part of the era's misery. Bubonic plague came along in 541, and this \" black death \" took a devastating toll on a populace already decimated by starvation. As news.com.au notes, all of this was taking place a mere 60 years or so after the collapse of western roman empire. Roads and bridges were crumbling, and violent \" local strongmen \" filled the leadership void. So when did things finally start turning around? mccormack suggests an answer for that as well: figure around 640. In a study in antiquity, his team reports a spike in particulate lead in layers of ice from that time. The appearance of the lead suggests the global economy was on the mend: it came from silver mining needed to produce coins, say the researchers.",

And it is here that most of the parts for apple's iphone, and the much-awaited ipad, which goes on sale in the uk this week, are manufactured. Yesterday, li hai, a 19-year-old employee of the firm, jumped from the top of the building in shenzhen to his death. It brought the number of suspected suicides at the factory this year to 10. There have been another two attempted suicides. All of the deaths have been of youngsters between 18 and 25 years old. Li hai had only been working at the plant for 42 days. The incidents have prompted intense soul-searching in china, about conditions in its factories and the social cost of breakneck economic development. Foxconn, one of the world's largest manufacturers of electronic equipment, is huge. The chefs slaughter 6,000 pigs a day to feed the company's nearly 400,000 workers in this giant industrial complex, spread over 1.2 square miles. But the taiwanese owners now face a major problem. Li hai's death, and those of his colleagues, have raised questions about working conditions in chinese"

            "While diplomatically inconvenient for the western powers, palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas's attempt to get the united nations to unilaterally declare a palestinian state has elicited widespread sympathy. After all, what choice did he have? according to the accepted narrative, middle east peace is made impossible by a hard-line likud-led israel that refuses to accept a palestinian state and continues to build settlements. It is remarkable how this gross inversion of the truth has become conventional wisdom. In fact, benjamin netanyahu brought his likud-led coalition to open recognition of a palestinian state, thereby creating israel's first national consensus for a two-state solution. He is also the only prime minister to agree to a settlement freeze — 10 months — something no labor or kadima government has ever done. To which abbas responded by boycotting the talks for nine months, showing up in the 10th, then walking out when the freeze expired. Last week he reiterated that he will continue to boycott peace talks unless israel gives up — in advance — claim to any territory beyond the 1967 lines.

Bieber still hasn't produced the required paperwork for mally since customs authorities seized the 17-week-old capuchin monkey in march, and a customs spokesperson says mally will remain in the munich animal protection league shelter until they hear from either bieber or someone with his power of attorney, or until may 17 ( at which point the monkey becomes germany's property ), whichever comes first. In emails sent to the shelter, bieber appears to not have any interest in re-acquiring his monkey, the ap reports. The first email — which hasn't been confirmed as coming from bieber's management company, but \" appear[ s ] to be \" legit, according to a shelter spokesperson — asks how long bieber has to provide the papers before mally is euthanized. Informed that the monkey would not be euthanized, a second email says, \" our team is looking into the idea of placing mally at a zoo in germany.... We are very concerned that mally is safe and placed in the best possible residence. \" a rep from the shelter tells e! they would prefer to place mally in a rescue, not a zoo. And if you're not already angry enough at bieber, the daily mail has this tidbit: the baby monkey makes constant \" heartbreaking \" calls, looking for other members of its family group.",

        "summary": "Eating lots of carrots will improve your vision, right? not exactly, the american chemical society explains in a new video. Bottom line: carrots can contribute in a general way to overall eye health, but they're not going to prevent you from needing glasses. As the acs video explains, carrots contain beta carotene, which the body processes into vitamin a. The vitamin is good for the eyes, but plenty of other foods also have it, including peas, cantaloupe, spinach, lettuce, even cheese. If you're already eating a balanced diet, then, carrots won't make much of a difference in vision. So how did they get the reputation as being great for eyesight? the answer goes back to world war ii. One story holds that british pilots during the war didn't want to reveal the existence of the radar that helped them \" see, \" so the military made up a rumor that eating carrots explained the pilots'suddenly improved ability to shoot down enemy bombers at night. The myth didn't just trick the nazis: the british public believed it, too, snopes reports. As scientific american recounts, the uk ministry of food rolled out a propaganda campaign telling brits to eat lots of carrots to help them see better during blackouts, and a kitchen legend was born. The acs takeaway: \" don't forget your vitamin a, but don't count on getting rid of your glasses anytime soon just because you're chomping on a carrot. \" ( a bionic eye recently helped a blind man start to see again. )",

Superior court judge scott m. Gordon refused to address how polanski would be sentenced if he returned to the us after 40 years abroad. He noted that other courts have ruled that the 83-year-old oscar winner is a fugitive and must return to los angeles for sentencing, the ap reports. \" there is no sufficient or compelling basis for reconsideration of these issues, \" gordon wrote. Deputy da michele hanisee said polanski was asking gordon to give a \" wealthy celebrity different treatment than any other fugitive. \" polanski was charged with six felonies in 1977 after he was accused of plying a 13-year-old girl with champagne and part of a sedative pill, then raping her at jack nicholson's house. Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, but he fled los angeles on the eve of sentencing in 1978 and his travel has since been confined to three countries: france, switzerland, and his native poland. Polanski lawyer harland braun says polanski cut a deal to serve just 48 days and fled after the now-deceased judge suggested he might renege on the deal and send him to prison for 50 years. Braun said judicial misconduct is the main issue in the case and called gordon's ruling \" just another cover-up. \" ( polanski's alleged victim recently spoke out. )",

The queen performed her new song \" formation \" dressed in a killer militant get-up ( with strong michael jackson vibes ) and took the stage for a dance-off with mars ( who won? impossible to say ). Bey also had a rare misstep for a moment, almost falling backward while dancing, but she recovered pretty quickly. After that, coldplay took back the stage and performed \" clocks \" while a video montage showed the many a-listers to perform halftime shows in years past -- bruce springsteen, michael jackson, james brown, etc. During the footage, martin even sang bits of past performers'song, including prince's \" purple rain \" and u2's \" beautiful day. \" after coldplay wrapped with \" up &amp; up, \" the words \" believe in love \" exploded over the super bowl 50 crowd."

        "summary": "Angelina jolie has had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed and is now in menopause at the age of 39, she reveals in a new york times op-ed. Jolie — who had a double mastectomy two years ago — says she decided on the preventive surgery because she has a mutated brca1 gene, which puts her at a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer, and recent tests suggested there could be a chance of early cancer. Jolie says she wants other women to hear her story and stresses that a \" positive brca test does not mean a leap to surgery, \" but she decided on the move because cancer killed her mother, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at age 49, her grandmother, and an aunt. Jolie says she is now in forced menopause, despite hormone replacements, and will not be able to have more children. Though still prone to cancer, \" i will look for natural ways to strengthen my immune system. I feel feminine, and grounded in the choices i am making for myself and my family, \" she writes. \" i know my children will never have to say, ' mom died of ovarian cancer. ' \" she says she feels deeply for younger women faced with the same choice she has had to make, and though the decision is tough, \" it is possible to take control and tackle head-on any health issue. You can seek advice, learn about the options, and make choices that are right for you. Knowledge is power. \" when jolie went public after surgery in 2013, genetic testing for breast cancer doubled in the uk, the guardian reports.",

Elsewhere: in terms of overall damage, new jersey is emerging as clearly having fared the worst, the new york times reports, noting that the storm decimated whole neighborhoods. Sandy likely caused billions of dollars in damage to the state, a quarter of whose residents were still without power yesterday, and nj.com notes that utility officials are saying it could take two weeks or more to get the lights back on. In hoboken, water \" filled the city like a bathtub, \" says its mayor. Fearing looting — which has hit brooklyn and long island — a number of areas have established curfews. Gov. Chris christie has waived rules preventing gas stations from buying fuel out of state, nj.com reports, as limited supplies are facing long lines after the hurricane closed key pipelines and refineries. On a lighter note, long island's billy joel and new jersey sons bruce springsteen and jon bon jovi are to give a benefit concert on nbc tomorrow at 8pm, notes the ap. Lineup also includes christina aguilera, sting, and jimmy fallon.",

The tradition began in 1973, after a riverboat captain found a toe preserved in a pickle jar and decided it would be a good idea to drop the digit into a big glass of champagne then take a drink. Since then, more than 100,000 people are estimated to have taken part in the sourtoe cocktail ritual at the downtown hotel's sourdough saloon. The one rule: \" the lips have gotta touch the toe. \" sometimes the lips touch the toe and vomiting or at least gagging ensues, the hotel manager tells the wall street journal. Other times, drinkers get a little overly enthusiastic: after 725 go-rounds, the first toe was swallowed by a miner; replacement toes have also since been damaged or swallowed. But the replacements keep coming in: one from a trapper who lost a toe to frostbite, one that was the victim of a lawn mower incident, another that was amputated and saved for years in a freezer. But no matter where the current toe hails from, you needn't worry about hygiene: the toes are pickled in medical alcohol for months then placed in dry salts. \" the risk of freezing on the way to the bar or being attacked by a pack of wolves would be higher, \" a health and social services worker tells the journal.",

Wu said that with its reflective coating, the satellite would be able to reflect sunlight on an area up to 50 square miles in diameter, the telegraph reports. He said the satellite has been in the testing phase for years.

        "summary": "Donald trump might have two media targets in his sights soon: a washington post investigation suggests that when trump spends time on the campaign trail slamming greedy american firms for sending us jobs overseas, he is either a recent convert to the cause or a hypocrite. A politico analysis, meanwhile, finds that trump spouts a \" misstatement \" of some sort every five minutes in speeches. The post spoke to people involved in a 2004 deal for trump-branded clothing, one of the first of many similar deals. Trump was personally involved in the negotiations and at no point expressed any preference for having merchandise manufactured in the us, insiders say. The deal went to a firm that operates in dozens of countries, and trump-branded items are now made in countries such as china and bangladesh. A harvard professor analyzed trump products available online and found that many are made outside the us, with 628 of 838 ivanka trump products coming from overseas. \" i don't decry what he and his daughter do, \" the professor tells the post. \" but at the same time, for him to claim that this is somehow immoral and go after companies that have relocated manufacturing when he has done the same puts him in conflict with his own rhetoric. \" as for politico, it put 4.6 hours of trump speeches from last week through its fact-checking process and found more than 60 inaccuracies it considers \" mischaracterizations, exaggerations, or simply false. \" those include his claims that the us has a \" $ 500 billion a year trade deficit with china \" — a figure that politico says is $ 134 billion too high — and his boasts that he never settles lawsuits or takes money from donors. It also takes issue with several of trump's statements about his standing in the polls, including a boast that he's \" winning every poll with the hispanics, \" when, in fact, a major one in february found that 8 in 10 hispanic voters viewed him unfavorably.

In the latest controversy, the state gop has demanded the personal emails of a renowned university of wisconsin history professor who's been critical of gov. Scott walker's anti-union moves, reports the milwaukee journal sentinel. The professor is william cronon, who first entered the fray via his personal blog and more publicly in an op-ed in the new york times. Using the open records law, the state republican party has requested all emails he's written on his state university account that include terms such as \" union, \" \" scott walker, \" \" collective bargaining, \" etc. Republicans apparently want to see whether cronon violated ethics policies about university employees trying to influence political matters while on the job. Cronon denies it but sees the request ( which hasn't been fulfilled yet ) as an attack on academic freedom and objects to it on principle. Read his full response here. His many defenders, including paul krugman at his new york times blog and josh marshall at talking points memo, agree. \" it's just another example of the kind of thuggish behavior that has become the trademark of walker's rule, \" writes marshall.

In fact, peterson has managed to become \" one of the most influential — and polarizing — public intellectuals in the english-speaking world, \" writes kelefa sanneh in the new yorker. Some basics about him: a theme, and critique: peterson \" delivers stern fatherly lectures to young men on how to be honorable, upright, and self-disciplined — how to grow up and take responsibility for their own lives, \" writes david brooks in the new york times. The message has found an audience, though brooks says it \" sounds to me like vague exhortatory banality. \" peterson's \" recipe for self-improvement is solitary, nonrelational, unemotional, \" and brooks thinks \" the lives of young men can be improved more through loving attachment than through peterson's joyless and graceless calls to self-sacrifice. \" the interview: virtually every story about peterson refers to this interview of him by cathy newman of channel 4 news in britain earlier this year. In it, he defends his view that men need to \" grow the hell up, \" and the gist of much commentary is that peterson came up against a hostile interviewer and won convincingly.

( rj sangosti, the denver post ) in the largest protest this week, at least 700 jefferson county students left classes wednesday morning in protest of school board decisions and proposed changes to history curriculum. The students gathered at the intersection of ken caryl avenue and chatfield boulevard by mid-morning, most from rival high schools chatfield and dakota ridge. Some of the students waved american flags and held signs that said, \" don't make history a mystery, \" which has become a slogan of this week's walk-outs. Others piled into cars and sped around the intersection honking their horns and screaming out open windows. Tensions have been mounting in the school district as students, parents and teachers push back against district leadership. Wednesday's protests meant that students at roughly half of all county high schools had walked-out of their classes in protest this week. Community members are angry about an evaluation-based system for awarding raises to educators and a proposed curriculum committee that would call for promoting \" positive aspects \" of the united states and its heritage and avoiding material that would encourage or condone \" civil disorder, social strife or disregard"

            "( cnn ) a paradigm-changing north korean missile test has left the united states and china split over how to deal with the aggressive rogue state. While china and russia have called for concessions on both sides, the us so far has made no public move to open talks, instead opting to engage in a renewed military show of force with its south korean ally. North korea announced tuesday it had successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ), which state media said had reached an altitude of 2,802 kilometers ( 1,741 miles ), its highest ever missile test. State media in pyongyang said north korea now had the power to now strike the american mainland with a nuclear warhead. While experts caution against taking north korea's claims at face value, the pentagon and south korea's intelligence services have said they believed the missile was an icbm.

        "summary": "Police said tuesday that the driver who rammed a truck into a crowded christmas market in the heart of the german capital, killing at least 12 people and injuring nearly 50, did so intentionally and that they are investigating a suspected terror attack, the ap reports. The truck struck the popular christmas market filled with tourists and locals outside the kaiser wilhelm memorial church near berlin's zoo station late monday. On tuesday, conflicting reports emerged about the suspected driver, and whether police had the right man. The latest: the bbc reports that the suspect in custody has been identified in german media reports as a 23-year-old pakistani man named \" naved b \" who entered germany as a refugee in december 2015. After fleeing the scene of the attack on foot, he was captured more than a mile away. Police say a witness followed him. He has reportedly denied involvement. But according to german newspaper die welt's unnamed senior security sources, he's not the right guy. Reuters has this translation: \" we have the wrong man... The true perpetrator is still armed, at large and can cause fresh damage. \" german chancellor angela merkel says it would be \" particularly repugnant \" if the attacker came to the country as a refugee, the guardian reports. \" we have to assume we are dealing with a terrorist attack, \" she said in a statement, promising that the perpetrators would be severely punished. Police say that an injured polish man found in the truck died as he was being treated for his wounds. He is believed to have been the original driver of the truck, whose owner, his cousin, told authorities the truck must have been hijacked, the ap reports. Donald trump blamed the attack on \" islamist terrorists, \" the independent reports. \" isis and other islamist terrorists continually slaughter christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad, \" he said. \" these terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners. \" american witness shandana durrani tells cnn that she was in the market when the truck started mowing down people as they were \" running, scurrying, screaming \" just 20 feet in front of her. \" i heard some popping and thought maybe there was a guy with a gun, \" she says. \" people just started running and dropping their gluehwein. \"",

Per business insider, the young entrepreneur, who hosts his family's ryan toysreview channel on the video-sharing site, helped his household bring in about $ 11 million in pretax income this year, simply by opening toys and other products and reviewing them online. This monetized mastery of the \" unboxing \" phenomenon — what the verge has described as \" a blend of innocent childhood antics and relentless, often overwhelming consumerism \" — places ryan's channel in the no. 8 slot on the forbes list ( tied with the slapstick team smosh ), alongside other big youtube names like brothers jake and logan paul, minecraft whiz daniel \" dantdm \" middleton, and the controversial pewdiepie ( real name: felix kjellberg ). What makes ryan unusual is, obviously, his age. \" he is definitely the youngest youtube star we've ever seen, \" an industry analyst told the verge in last december's profile. Ryan's parents posted his first video in march 2015 after the youtube-obsessed preschooler wanted to know why he couldn't dish on toys online like other kids, per a tubefilter interview from last year. In july of that year, the family experienced its first viral video: ryan opening a \" giant egg surprise \" with more than 100 cars-branded toys. The channel has exploded since, now with over 10 million subscribers and more than 16 million views, per the washington post. Ryan's parents told tubefilter they mainly film on the weekends so it doesn't interfere with their son's schooling and that they pay for all of the toys ryan reviews.

Adults mostly eat live shrimp, the cephalopod page reports, and they produce large quantities of mucus, which form a thick, protective 'jello ' jacket around them. The footage was captured by a remotely-operated submersible, sent down to the sea floor by scientists working on the ocean exploration vessel e/v nautilus.

            "The stubby squid's giant eyes, that \" look painted on, \" caused one researcher to compare the sea creature to a children's toy. A purple squid with eyes so googly it could easily be mistaken for a character in the movie \" finding nemo \" was recently spotted by scientists off the coast of southern california. The so-called stubby squid ( rossia pacifica ) is a species of bobtail squid native to the northern pacific ocean. These adorable sea creatures can be found in waters from japan to southern california, and typically dwell along the ocean floor, at depths of around 984 feet ( 300 meters ), though they have been spotted as deep as 4,260 feet ( 1,300 m ), according to the monterey bay aquarium research institute ( mbari ).

            "Published on aug 12, 2016 the team spotted this stubby squid off the coast of california at a depth of 900 meters ( 2,950 feet ). The stubby squid ( rossia pacifica ) looks like a cross between an octopus and squid, but is more closely related to cuttlefish. This species spends life on the seafloor, activating a sticky mucus jacket and burrowing into the sediment to camouflage, leaving their eyes poking out to spot prey like shrimp and small fish. Rossia pacifica is found in the northern pacific from japan to southern california, most commonly seen up to 300m deep, but specimens have been collected at 1000m depth. E/v nautilus is exploring the ocean studying biology, geology, archeology, and more. Watch http://www.nautiluslive.org for live video from the ocean floor.
