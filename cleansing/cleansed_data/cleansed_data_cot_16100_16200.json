Starting in april, bar marco will stop accepting tips and start paying its full-time servers $ 35,000 a year, plus benefits unusual for the restaurant world: health care, paid vacation, and shares in the company, reports next pittsburgh. It won't add a service fee to the bill or otherwise raise prices to pay for the switch. \"all of our current employees have seen and approved the contract, \" says co-owner robert fry. \"they will have a lot of responsibilities, too — like being present at bi-monthly finance meetings. We want complete transparency. We want people who want to be part of what we are doing. \" the tribune-review talks to a bar marco bartender happy with the move who predicts that workers will stay in their jobs longer because of the stability. The establishment isn't the first to implement a no-tip policy, and a san diego restaurateur explains why he thinks it makes sense.",

Corey lewandowski was charged with simple battery after former breitbart reporter michelle fields said he yanked her away from trump during a march 8 rally, leaving bruises on her arm. Trump's social media director now says the case will go no further, reports fox news. Fields says the state attorney's office asked lewandowski to publicly apologize in lieu of prosecution, but it's not clear if he accepted the offer. \" prosecutor's office told me they would inform me of decision tomorrow, \" fields tweeted. \" if reports true, guess they decided to leak to reporters first. Ugly. \" state attorney david aronberg is expected to confirm the reports at a news conference thursday. Earlier this week, he told politico that police in jupiter, fla. — where the incident took place — had a low \" probable cause \" to charge lewandowski, but his office has \" a higher standard to go forward with a prosecution. \" several lawyers suggested a jury wouldn't consider the incident a case of battery. Fields says she may still pursue defamation charges after lewandowski and the trump campaign labeled her attention-seeking and questioned her integrity, per cnn and fox. Trump has stood by lewandowski over the past month, arguing fields \" broke through secret service \" and \" had a pen in her hand \" which agents may have thought was \" a little bomb. \"",

Peter waldron was arrested for possession of assault rifles and ammunition just days before that nation's elections, reports politico. A conviction could have netted him life in prison, but he was released after a campaign by friends and help from the bush administration, according to waldron. He told the atlantic following the straw poll that he was responsible for bachmann's \" faith-based outreach \" in iowa and south carolina, but he refused to give his name. Exactly what he was doing in uganda remains murky. According to one report, he was working for a newsletter in uganda — and establishing a health-care management technology system, says the daily mail. Still other sources linked him to congolese rebels working to capture a ugandan guerilla leader to collect a reward. The kampala monitor reported he was working with a congo group to set up a christian political party in uganda. He also reportedly told a friend he has worked for the cia. Waldron says on his website he was \" falsely accused of being a spy \" in uganda, and his ordeal is detailed in an odd film, the ultimate price, which has a trailer posted on youtube. For now, bachmann is standing behind her man. \" michele's faith is an important part of her life and peter did a tremendous job with our faith outreach in iowa, \" said an email from a bachmann aide. \" we are fortunate to have him on our team and look forward to having him expanding his efforts in several states. \"",

A pilot familiar with the a320 weighs in: \" if you encounter turbulence, you go slower at what we call the turbulence penetration speed to get through it. If you climb to avoid turbulence, you slow down to have a better climb rate....

Jonathan chait of the new republic calls it a \"classic anti-semitic trope, \" the claim that \" jews hate palin because they distrust real americans, \" and he finds it \"beyond strange \" to see in a jewish magazine. And former bush aide david frum points out that jews aren't alone in hating palin, who polls poorly among the young, women, and independents. \"if american jews have a problem with palin, \" he writes on his blog, it's \"that they — we — doubt her intellectual capacity for the job. \"",

All these things are known as the technosphere, and for the first time ever — in a study published last month in the anthropocene review — scientists have estimated their total weight: an impressive 30 trillion tons. According to forbes, that's \" enough to add another good-sized mountain to the appalachians, or perhaps even to the rockies. \" or as a press release breaks it down, it's roughly 110 pounds per square meter of the earth's surface. Researchers say the technosphere is a \" major new phenomenon on this planet \" that is \" evolving extraordinarily rapidly. \" it's also a handy means of measuring how much humans have shaped the planet. Scientists argue that the sheer scale of the technosphere is convincing evidence that we're living in a new, as-yet-unofficial geologic epoch known as the \" anthropocene, \" gizmodo reports. The quickest way to be recognized as an epoch is to have a discernible fossil record, and due to the fact that the technosphere is — unlike the biosphere — \" remarkably poor at recycling its own materials, \" that shouldn't be a problem. If \" technofossils \" from the anthropocene were classified like normal fossils, there would more than a billion different types, outnumbering the types of species currently alive.

        "summary": "A type of mexican fish heads every spring to the gulf of california to spawn — and their \" reproductive orgies, \" as the afp puts it, are so loud they can damage hearing in other marine life. A pair of studies from the same researchers, one published in june in the scientific reports journal and one posted just this month in the biology letters journal, says that the sound of an individual gulf corvina issuing a pulsating mating call sounds like a \" really loud machine gun. \" and when hundreds of thousands of them get together to do the deed, \" the collective chorus sounds like a crowd cheering at a stadium or perhaps a really loud beehive, \" says study co-author timothy rowell. This commotion-filled copulation isn't just the \" loudest sound ever recorded for a fish species, \" rowell says. When this happens, it's \" among the loudest wildlife events found on planet earth. \" the researchers gathered data in march and april 2014, when about 1.5 million corvinas converged in the colorado river delta to procreate. Different tools were used to measure fish location, density, and loudness. What scientists found was a racket so loud ( listen to clips at gizmodo ) it can cause hearing loss in dolphins, seals, and sea lions, even deafening them — though, oddly, sea lions and dolphins were found feeding nearby. The noise the spawning fish make doesn't help themselves, either: fishermen are able to track exactly where they're located from the sound and scoop them out of the water. Gizmodo notes this ends up as a harvest that's \" hugely disruptive \" to the species, leaving them \" vulnerable \" to extinction due to overfishing. The researchers say the sex sounds came about as part of the evolutionary process, allowing the fish to communicate above the surrounding din. ( maybe they should go spawn in sweden. )",

Scientists say that an ancient upper jawbone and associated stone tools could also mean that homo sapiens — modern humans — arose in africa far earlier than fossils now show. And it may cause rethinking about how we evolved and interacted with now-extinct cousin species, such as neanderthals. \" when they start moving out of africa and what geographical route they choose to do it are the two most important questions in recent human evolution, \" said tel aviv university anthropologist israel hershkovitz, lead author of a study published in the journal science. The jawbone, complete with several well-preserved teeth, was found to be somewhere between 177,000 and 194,000 years old, reports the ap. Previously, the oldest fossils of modern humans found outside of africa were somewhere from 90,000 to 120,000 years old, also in israel. So given the range in both those estimates, the jawbone might be about 50,000 to 100,000 years older. The jaw was found in 2002 in the collapsed misliya cave on the western slope of mount carmel. Researchers spent the last decade-and-a-half looking for more remains and other fossils before publishing their study. They say the jaw belonged to a young adult of unknown gender. The science paper suggests modern humans could have left africa 220,000 years ago, with some of the authors saying maybe it was even earlier. That's in part because the cave also contained about 60,000 flint tools, mostly blades and sharp points, some of which are 250,000 years old, per a study co-author. The ap has much more.",

            "Earliest modern humans out of africa recent paleoanthropological studies have suggested that modern humans migrated from africa as early as the beginning of the late pleistocene, 120,000 years ago. Hershkovitz et al. Now suggest that early modern humans were already present outside of africa more than 55,000 years earlier ( see the perspective by stringer and galway-witham ). During excavations of sediments at mount carmel, israel, they found a fossil of a mouth part, a left hemimaxilla, with almost complete dentition. The sediments contain a series of well-defined hearths and a rich stone-based industry, as well as abundant animal remains. Analysis of the human remains, and dating of the site and the fossil itself, indicate a likely age of at least 177,000 years for the fossil — making it the oldest member of the homo sapiens clade found outside africa.

I do not need a photo op, \" obama said en route to the country, where he will spend the three days as part of a three-nation africa trip. \" the last thing i want to do is to be in any way obtrusive at a time when the family is concerned about nelson mandela's condition. \" mandela, who turns 95 next month, was rushed to hospital three weeks ago with a recurring lung disease. His condition is said to be critical, although the presidency says there have been some signs of improvements in recent days.

Authorities say all five have confessed to involvement in the attack, one of the deadliest against ordinary mexicans in the country's 5-year-old war on drug cartels, the washington post reports. The victims, mostly middle-aged women playing bingo, died after the attackers sprayed gasoline at the casino's entrance and set it alight. President felipe calderon has called the killings an act of terror — and said the us shares the blame — but many mexicans believe corruption is also to blame, the wall street journal reports. One of the five suspects was arrested last year in a stolen vehicle carrying an illegal gun and authorities have not been able to explain why he was released. Federal prosecutors are investigating why five police officers stationed just a block away from the casino did not respond to the attack or chase the suspects.",

But ma says his best days were more than 20 years ago, when he taught english at a college in hangzhou, china. \" if you have less than $ 1 million, you know how to spend the money, \" he told attendees of the economic club luncheon, according to business insider. \" [ at ] $ 1 billion, that's not your money.... The money i have today is a responsibility. It's the trust of people on me, \" he said. Ma went as far as to say he wished alibaba had never gone public, and that things are \" much worse \" for him and the company since the ipo. It appears that having the eyes of the world fixed upon alibaba is taxing for the businessman. \" it's not only our people that watch us, the globe watches us, \" he explained, according to cnnmoney. \" you have to get used to it. \" ( ma has made similar comments before. )",

The judge ruled that the companies had created a \" public nuisance \" by selling the toxic paint for decades before it was banned in 1978, the los angeles times reports. Some 5 million homes in the cities and counties that sued, mainly in low-income neighborhoods, may still contain enough lead paint to pose a health risk. Childhood exposure to lead has been linked to learning disabilities, other health problems, and even adult criminality. But the paint companies say they sold the lead paint in good faith before the ban and have vowed to fight the ruling, the ap reports. \" the decision rewards scofflaw landlords who are responsible for the risk to children from poorly maintained lead paint, and it conflicts with and threatens to upend california's lead poisoning prevention programs, which work, \" a spokeswoman for the companies says. \" this decision is more likely to hurt children than help them, and it will likely disrupt the sale, rental, and market value of all homes and apartments built before 1978. \"",

It also hurts business by making it difficult and expensive to recruit and hire employees, says the brief. Meanwhile, two former secretaries of state — john kerry and madeline albright — also registered their opposition with the court, joined by other former democratic officials, reports the new york times. \" the order will likely feed the recruitment narrative of ( isis ) and other extremists that portray the united states as at war with islam, \" says the legal brief. The states of washington and minnesota, which are challenging the ban, also filed a brief monday arguing that putting it back in place would \" unleash chaos again, \" reports the ap. The appeals court, which rejected a white house bid for an immediate reinstatement over the weekend, has given the justice department until 6pm monday to respond. After that, it will rule on whether the ban should remain on hold. Either way, the case is expected to wind up in the supreme court.

His rationale? the money came from him personally, not from his campaign. The payments \" weren't taken out of the campaign finance, that's the big thing, \" trump said, per fox news. \" they didn't come out of the campaign, they came from me. \" but some, including jonathan chait at new york, think trump just accidentally admitted to a crime. On flipping: trump says cohen made a deal for a lighter sentence, asserting that people in that situation \" just make up lies \" to prosecutors. \" it's called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal, \" adding, \" it's not a fair thing. \" he laid a hypothetical scenario in which \" you get 10 years in jail, but if you say bad things about somebody in other words, make up stories if you don't know. Make up. They just make up lies. I've seen it many times. \" on impeachment: trump predicted bad things for the us if democrats win control of the house and impeach him, per politico. First of all, \" i don't know how you can impeach somebody who has done a great job, \" he said. But \" if i ever got impeached, i think the market would crash. I think everybody would be very poor because... You would see numbers that you wouldn't believe, in reverse. \" on a pardon: trump did not rule out pardoning paul manafort when asked directly about the possibility, notes politico.

Very sad/tragic things happened #holocaust #berlin \" but that has failed to stem the tide of criticism on social media for his ill-thought out words. Green also sought to diffuse the situation on twitter with an apology. Danny green ( @dgreen_14 ) yes, mistakes do happen danny green ( @dgreen_14 ) i want to sincerely apologize for the insensitivity of my post! danny green ( @dgreen_14 ) i have great respect n understanding for this country's history n wanted to continue chronicling my experience in berlin danny green ( @dgreen_14 ) but showed poor judgement...

            "As of this writing, the spurs are leading alba berlin, 81-82, at the o2 world stadium in berlin, germany. Earlier in the day, though, sharpshooting san antonio wing danny green got into some controversy while he was sightseeing. Green posted an unseemly selfie to his facebook from the holocaust museum and attached a caption to the pic he definitely wishes he could take back. Green isn't smirking in the picture and there's nothing inherently wrong with it until you read the offending caption: \"you know i had to do it one time lol #holocaust. \" the lol in particular isn't a very appropriate response to a museum commemorating the estimated 6 million jewish people and countless other religious and ethnic groups who were killed during the genocidal horror that was nazi-led holocaust. Since then green has changed the caption to read \"a lot of history here, more than you could imagine … very sad/tragic things happened?#?holocaust??#?berlin? \" he's also issued a series of apologies for the selfie on twitter: i want to sincerely apologize for the insensitivity of my post! — danny green ( @dgreen_14 ) october 8, 2014 i have great respect n understanding for this country's history n wanted",

A rumor circulating on the internet this week claims that isis put 16 fighters on the fast-track to heaven for contracting hiv from a moroccan sex slave. The men were reportedly \"sentenced \" to death by suicide bombing, according to the ara news agency, which relied on anonymous sources in the city. \"most of those infected are foreign militants who had sexual intercourse with two moroccan women. The women passed on the disease to the militants before their infection was revealed. We were ordered by the group's local leadership to transfer the infected militants to a quarantine center in the city, \" a syrian doctor in the town of al-mayadeen allegedly told ara news, a news agency that covers northern syria. The city is a 2.5-hour drive southeast of the isis \"capital \" of raqqa. It almost seems too crazy to be true and the daily beast could not independently confirm it. But isis has proven in the past to exceed our worst imaginations.

Harroun tells the fbi that he ended up at an al-nusra camp after a battle and eventually was accepted by the fighters. The \" weapon of mass destruction \" he used against assad's troops was a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, reports ap. Harroun was arrested upon his return to the us this week. He didn't exactly keep his exploits secret as they unfolded, posting facebook updates, photos, and youtube videos about his battles.

The brothers have launched a group known as the libre initiative, reuters reports, and it marks a bit of a departure from the duo's usual attack-ad-chucking tactics. While the group still does air such ads against democrats, it also takes a page from the liberal activist playbook by sponsoring outreach programs such as english classes and driver's license workshops. \" if they trust us, they may seek our opinion on something else, \" one libre employee says. Still, the group faces an uphill battle. Congressional republicans are blocking immigration reform, and a study released last week found that young immigrants overwhelmingly prefer democrats regardless of local republicans ' immigration stance. Obamacare is more popular among hispanics as well; a recent libre event opposing it was sparsely attended, and some attendees told reuters they were there only for the chance to win an ipad.",

            "Download a pdf of this backgrounder james gimpel is a professor of government at the university of maryland, college park. This is an updated version of a previous cis backgrounder published in 2010. This backgrounder examines the partisan political implications of large-scale immigration. A comparison of voting patterns in presidential elections across counties over the last three decades shows that mass immigration has caused a steady drop in presidential republican vote shares, particularly in the nation's largest counties. Each one percentage-point increase in the immigrant share of a large county's population reduces the republican share of the two-party vote by nearly 0.6 percentage points on average. Three key conclusions emerge from this analysis: first, the enormous flow of legal immigrants in to the country — 29.5 million 1980 to 2012 — has remade and continues to remake the nation's electorate in favor of the democratic party. Second, the partisan impact of immigration is relatively uniform throughout the country — from california to texas to florida — even though local republican parties have taken different positions on illegal immigration. The decline does not seem to vary with the local republican party's position on illegal immigration. Third, if legal immigration levels remain at the current levels of over one million a year, it will likely continue to undermine republicans ' political prospects moving forward. Further, if the substantial"

In approving a $ 100 million project that will see a larger holding facility for the park's orcas, the california coastal commission imposed some conditions: bans on captive whale breeding and bringing in wild-caught orcas — changes that could eventually put a stop to the park's killer whale shows, reports the los angeles times. Seaworld opposed the breeding ban, noting it meant its 11 whales would likely be the park's last and arguing only the federal government has the authority to restrict breeding and transfers. \" breeding is a natural, fundamental, and important part of an animal's life, and depriving a social animal of the right to reproduce is inhumane, \" seaworld said after the decision, adding it \" will carefully review and consider our options. \" cnn notes that during the hearing seaworld did say it would be ok with a cap of 15 orcas. The verdict came after more than eight hours of testimony from marine biologists, activists, children, and pamela anderson, who wore a shirt reading \" seaworld kills \" and equated the whales'treatment to \" torture, \" per cnn. The larger facility, dubbed blue world, will include a new 450,000-gallon pool and 5.2 million-gallon tank — covering an area of 1.5 acres — which will replace an existing 1.7 million-gallon holding facility, per the times.

Authorities waited a few minutes for him to die, and when he didn't, they gave him another dose. After a few minutes, they gave him another, and another. In all, it took 15 doses before wood was pronounced dead nearly two hours later. The state defended its procedure, notes the arizona republic, saying that prisons chief charles ryan was in constant contact with the iv team and followed the correct protocol. Ryan promised an independent review. Wood, who murdered his girlfriend and her father in 1989, was supposed to get 50mg of each drug, but he ended up getting 750mg of each instead, reports the new york times. \" they're making this up as they go along, \" says an anesthesiologist, who explains that because the drugs are made to treat patients, figuring out the precise dose necessary to kill someone is mostly guesswork.

Police are investigating the situation. The age of consent in britain is 16, the huffington post reports. Britain's current youngest mother was 12 when she gave birth in 2014; her baby is being raised by its 28-year-old grandmother. Britain's youngest father was 12 years old when his son was born in 1998. Meanwhile, one of britain's former youngest mothers, tressa middleton, who gave birth at the age of 12 in 2006, is expecting another child, metro.co.uk reports. Middleton was forced to give up her first child after it was revealed she was impregnated when her brother raped her. \" i am finally going to be the mother i have longed to be all these years, \" says middleton, now 23. Despite these record-holders making headlines, britain's teen birth rate is the lowest it's been since records began about 50 years ago, reports the telegraph. It notes that while better education and access to contraception is credited, another theory points out that the decline coincides with the rise of social media, suggesting that teens are spending more time with their phones than significant others. The average age of british mothers is now the highest on record at 30.2 years old. ( half of this country's married couples aren't having sex. )",

As uninhabitable. The san francisco chronicle reports that multiple buildings, known to offer million-dollar views on a budget, will likely need to be demolished; the units at 320 and 330 were cleared out in 2010. Drone footage has captured the dramatic scene in recent days, and kron4 has pulled together google earth footage over recent years to show how quickly the cliff is eroding. While most residents are moving their things, and some have stayed at a nearby red cross emergency shelter, a few are refusing to budge. \" if it falls, it's not going to fall in 10 seconds, \" michelle mackay tells nbc news. \" we ' ll have plenty of time to get out of the front door. \" but pacifica police chief dan steidle notes that \" a yellow tag is not a suggestion.

The study found that of 18 male traders studied, the ones who made the most money were also the best at estimating their own heart rate, a test of interoception, bloomberg reports. Interoception is a person's sense of the signals his or her body is sending. \" our results suggest that signals from the body — the gut feelings of financial lore — contribute to success in the markets, \" afp quotes researchers as saying. And it seems the more attuned someone is to those gut feelings, the better a trader he is. The study found that not only are financial traders better at estimating their own heart rates than the general population — 78.2 % accuracy to 66.9 % accuracy — but that the longer a person has been a trader, the better his sense of interoception. \"it's incredible that the market might be selecting for this, \" john coates, a neuroscientist and former trader, tells bloomberg. \"there's this really powerful advantage in the market, and nobody knows about it. \" and while there's still a question of causation, a similar study showed people with better interoception were also better at gambling, cnbc reports.

        "summary": "Signs of hope in dc: both parties are increasingly pushing for an end to the government shutdown and a debt-ceiling increase, with president obama set to meet with 18 top house republicans today, the hill reports. Those republicans include paul ryan, who's at the forefront of a short-term plan to reopen the government and raise the debt limit for several weeks, and then overhaul medicare, social security, and the tax code, the new york times reports. Mitch mcconnell is quietly gauging support for a similar fix that would hinge on more modest policy moves, such as cutting obamacare's medical device tax and giving federal agencies more freedom in implementing the sequestration cuts, politico reports. Conservatives are under considerable pressure to cut some kind of deal, the hill notes — yesterday, a gallup poll found a 28 % approval rating for the gop, a record low for a party. The hill, the times, and politico note that the fight over obamacare itself now seems to be taking a back seat, despite opposition from tea partiers: \" there is a developing consensus that this is a lot bigger than an obamacare discussion, \" says gop rep. Jack kingston. Republican sen. Orrin hatch puts it more bluntly: \" i'd like to get rid of obamacare, no question about that, but i think that effort has failed... We're going to have to take it on in other ways. \" ryan and house majority leader eric cantor each published op-eds yesterday in the wall street journal and washington post, respectively; the post points out that while the pieces called on obama to start negotiating, they don't list obamacare as part of the equation. \" this is where we've been wanting to go all year long, \" ryan told roll call. \" we've always known the debt limit is the way to get a budget agreement. \" but he insisted that republicans weren't totally abandoning their obamacare efforts. \" we're bringing that to the table, too. \"",

A \" nationwide college student walk out \" is slated to occur at noon, and according to the group's website, some 75 colleges — from ut austin to ucla to the fashion institute of technology — plan to participate. From the streets to the courthouse: bloomberg reports that five group members yesterday filed a civil rights complaint related to the arrest of 700 protesters on the brooklyn bridge on saturday.

They create traffic jams that prevent others from evacuating. \" the people behind you deserve a chance to escape too, \" tweets a flight attendant and author. Laurie, who was \" infuriated \" by the dubai video, calls stopping for your luggage in an emergency \" attempted homicide. \" luggage can also puncture evacuation slides, making them unusable.

See the most-read stories this hour >> those guidelines estimate cancer risk from breathing arsenic and other toxic air pollutants is more than three times higher than previously thought, even at the same level of exposure. The changes, adopted last year, reflected what scientists now believe was an underestimate of the health risks infants and children face from air pollution. The findings will affect the company's permit applications before the air district, which seek to increase its production by 25 % and to operate around the clock. \" we're not surprised, \""

He said the university \" has suspended all sorority activity … due to concerns about activities that have taken place during the most recent rush and bid periods. \" the school has 18 sororities, and the ban applied to its 10 national panhellenic conference chapters. But that ban was eased following a wednesday night meeting between sorority chapter presidents and school officials, reports the chronicle, duke's student newspaper. That means sororities can hold alcohol-free events, per the chronicle, and social events will begin again on monday. Events may include study breaks, sisterhood events, meetings, and service activities, moneta said in a second statement. Duke's director of fraternity and sorority life and the president of the pan-hellenic council sent an email asking students to \" utilize this time to reflect and keep in mind the severity of this incident. We must maintain our sense of urgency to change the campus culture. \" in the later statement, moneta writes that the sororities are \" committed to focusing on lasting reforms \" and will seek \" actionable proposals for the immediate future. \" any remaining sanctions on sorority activities are \" expected to be lifted in the near future, \" he writes.",

If a group of officials and scholars have their way, that will soon change. The northern india university was undone by invaders in 1193, after teaching as many as 10,000 students who hailed from all parts of asia. Now a new nalanda international university is planned about six miles from the ruins of that piece of educational history — but many have their doubts that the new version will be able to pick up where the old one left off, reports the bbc. \" are top students and faculty going to be attracted to rural bihar? \" asks the director of boston's center for international higher education. We may soon find out: the idea to relaunch the institution got the backing of india, china, singapore, japan, and thailand in 2006; in the years since, the indian government formally established the university via a parliamentary act, temporary premises were readied, and the hindu reports that a winning architectural design for the new campus was chosen in may. History and ecology studies are set to begin next year, with an assist from yale, bangkok's chulalongkorn university, seoul university, and peking university. Bihar has ponied up the land, but those behind the school estimate they ' ll need $ 1 billion to bring it to life.

But as soon as he's able, a special team of interrogators from the fbi, the cia, and the pentagon will grill him without reading him his miranda rights. Authorities plan to invoke a rare \" public safety exception \" that allows them to question the 19-year-old without his lawyer present and without giving him the right to remain silent. The point is to find out whether other explosives or accomplices are still out there, and nbc news figures that he can be questioned without legal counsel for maybe 48 hours. It's still way too early to determine whether tsarnaev will be tried in military or civilian court. Senators john mccain and lindsey graham issued a statement arguing that tsarnaev should be held as an enemy combatant under the \" law of war \" and thus not entitled to the usual legal rights. That would result in a military commission, but nbc says the white house is determined to make this a civilian trial.

The author was the eldest of seven children in a family constantly moving from base to base, a life readers and moviegoers would learn well from the great santini as the 1976 novel and subsequent film, which starred robert duvall as the relentless and violent patriarch. The prince of tides, published in 1986, secured conroy a wide audience, despite uneven reviews for its story of a former football player from south carolina with a traumatic past and the new york psychiatrist who attempts to help him. It was made into a hit 1991 film starring nick nolte and barbra streisand.",
