The bird is said to have attacked owner singrai soren and slit his throat with razor blades he had attached to its legs. Villagers in mohanpur, west bengal, were warned not to approach what police described as 'an unknown rooster with black and red feathers '. Roosters brandishing deadly blades on their legs square up to each other at a cockfight one of the dead man's friends, known only as dasai, said: 'the rooster tried to get away from the ring several times, but soren pushed it into the ring repeatedly. 'this upset it and it attacked soren. ' roosters are usually given a break of at least an hour before taking on another opponent, he explained. 'most masters are satisfied with the cash reward of £ 28 for every fight and a dead opponent to feast on,'dasai added. A cockfight in progress in front of a large audience in thailand 'but soren wanted the rooster to go to the ring within a few minutes of its first fight and that is when it got upset.

After helping sun get the reptiles back into the box, folsom stopped at a store to get a closed plastic container for them, then drove sun to his destination: a local bus station. Cops were waiting for the taxi by the time they arrived — folsom speculates someone at the convenience store saw the creatures, which are a restricted species in maine, per wgme — and sun, via an interpreter, told police a pal in alabama had sent him the alligators a couple of months earlier, in exchange for which sun sent his friend a turtle. He added he was on his way from augusta to waterville to visit another friend, who he revealed was a ups worker he hoped could help him ship the gators to texas in a swap for a tegu lizard. Animal game wardens took custody of the gators, while sun was hit with a charge of importing or possessing wildlife without a permit.

The ceo of tote services says the captain, who was last heard from on thursday morning, had determined that the weather was good enough to follow a sister ship's path back to jacksonville, fla., the ap reports. \" regrettably he suffered a mechanical problem with his main propulsion system, which left him in the path of the storm, \" the ceo says. \" we do not know when his engine problems began to occur, nor the reasons for his engine problems. \" the coast guard believes the ship, with a crew of 28 americans and five poles, sank in 15,000 feet of water near the bahamas. Mariners tell the ap that the ship would probably have been able to make it through the worst of the storm if it had engine power, but without it, it would have been helpless and even abandoning ship would have been extremely difficult. Such disasters are extremely rare, reports the atlantic. Until the el faro, more boeing 777s had been lost at sea than large cargo ships over the last five years, and, amid a huge volume of maritime traffic, only six were lost in the decade from 2005, although dozens more ran aground or sank with some warning. Searchers are now looking for survivors instead of the ship itself, though all they have found so far is debris and a survival suit with \" unidentifiable \" human remains.",

            "Urban-education programs prepare them for imperative contemporary conversations with students. After a rash of police killings last summer, h. Richard milner, a professor of urban education at the university of pittsburgh, set out to answer a question that had been gnawing at him for some time. As a noted expert on race in education, he frequently received calls from journalists seeking comment on how to help teachers talk about race in the classroom, typically following the fatal police shooting of a black victim. And he always thought the questioning was misguided and inadequate. \"rather than asking me how to help teachers … we should be asking teachers if they believe race is salient … something [ they ] should be interrogating and thinking about [ in the classroom ]. \" so in early fall 2016, he surveyed 450 pre-service and current public-school teachers on their beliefs about race. Despite the small sample size, the preliminary findings from the nationally representative group revealed an intriguing disconnect. Teachers overwhelmingly agreed that race should be discussed in classrooms; they felt woefully unprepared to lead such conversations; and they strongly rejected discussing racial violence, which milner called \"central to working with … black and brown students \" who are frequently the victims of police shootings. \"basically, teachers said 'you've twisted my arm.

A new study maps out the subway system's dna, revealing an underground world packed with microbial diversity. \" people don't look at a subway pole and think, ' it's teeming with life, ' \" the study's lead author tells the new york times. \" after this study, they may. \" but he cautions that most discoveries are quite harmless. Actually, nearly half of dna found in the 17-month study match no known organism — hardly a surprise, considering that only a few thousand genomes have been mapped so far. And just 0.2 % of found microbes come from human dna. Among other findings: the study shows what new york subway riders are eating, including takeout pizza, chickpeas and kimchi. Weirdly, cucumber dna \" was the third-most prevalent found from more complex organisms, \" reports the washington post. Antibiotic-resistant microbes turned up in 27 % of samples, but overall only 12 % of found bacteria can be linked to disease. Three stations had \" traces of the bacteria that cause bubonic plague, \" likely caused by rats, says the journal. But there hasn't been a plague case in new york city for 12 years, the cdc notes. E. Coli showed up in 56 stations and bacteria linked to food poisoning in 215 stations. Again, researchers note that these findings don't mean new yorkers are at risk.

Brits stocked up on supersuction devices before a eu ban went into effect yesterday, with retail sales of models 1,600 watts or higher increasing fourfold and some people wheeling out two or more units at a time, reports the daily mail. \" they have been flying off the shelves, and that has been across the board — from uprights to cylinders, \" says a spokesman for the currys electronics chain. The european commission's rationale for the ban is to help stave off climate change and cut down on energy costs, notes the bbc. Retailers are allowed to dump the inventory they already have, but they can't import any more units, and manufacturers are banned from churning out more. But although people are complaining that less suction will mean more time pushing their vacuums around — therefore no significant reduction in energy use — a man who runs a vacuum museum in derbyshire and goes by the name \" mr. Vacuum cleaner \" tells the bbc that high wattage doesn't guarantee great suction anyway. Sir james dyson of the dyson vacuum empire agrees, pointing out that his company doesn't even make a machine over 1,600 watts, but he's still worried that current regulations will hurt the industry overall and keep people from buying powerful cleaners, reports the guardian.

Our biggest goal for this year is to get this country straightened out, and you can't get this country straightened out if you don't do something about spending, about deficit, about debt and get this economy moving again.

Rather, the place is home to something far less sinister: a kindly grandfather who happens to be what the state calls an artistic genius. Before falling on hard times about a decade ago, randall mckissick was a renowned artist with paintings on display in paris and new york. But emerging technology, a divorce, an eviction, and a series of thefts left mckissick down on his luck. That's when his childhood friend mike schumpert stepped in, offering mckissick an apartment in his home in cayce, sc, per wis. \" he never mentioned money, \" says mckissick, 70. \" i would like to pay him, but i don't have any. \" schumpert's son says his \" very charitable \" dad, who recently broke his back in a car accident, and his mother, who is disabled, now need to sell the home. But \" we want randy to be able to stay there, \" he says. The family is also looking at finding another apartment for mckissick and his three cats, but there are financial challenges, the state reports. \" in this age when people would sell out their mothers for a buck, here's two friends in dire straights who are trying to help each other out, \" a local artist says. Mckissick, who suffers from panic attacks, often finds it hard to leave the house but says he ' ll move out if he must. Though he's \" lost the spark \" for painting, \" i just want to paint again, \" he says. ( a new jersey family says their home has a stalker. )",

Half of us counties are currently without an ob-gyn, according to the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists, which finds that women in arizona, washington, utah, and idaho are at the greatest risk of an ob-gyn shortage, reports glamour. Those in florida, texas, north carolina, and nevada aren't far behind, and the issue isn't going away soon. Rural areas are expected to feel the worst of the effects of a predicted nationwide shortage of 8,800 ob-gyns by 2020 and 22,000 by 2050. But population data suggests los angeles, las vegas, orlando, miami, detroit, memphis, salt lake city, and st. Louis could also suffer shortages of doctors specially trained in matters relating to women's reproductive health, including pregnancy, per fortune. In problem areas, the female population is increasing while the number of ob-gyns is not. On average, ob-gyns retire several years earlier than primary care physicians. \" there's a really high rate of burnout, \" heather bartos, a 47-year-old ob-gyn who delivers up to 25 babies a month in texas tells glamour. Acog chief hal lawrence says \" you have to really love what you do \"; in addition to night work, doctors describe \" devastating \" lows when childbirth doesn't go to plan. Accordingly, malpractice insurance is important but expensive, taking up to a third of a doctor's salary in some areas, according to bartos. Some ob-gyns prefer to transition to gynecology specifically, per glamour, which notes women may have to rely on teams of medical professionals, including midwives.

            "House republican todd young ( ind. ) has introduced legislation to reduce the excise tax on vodka, rum, gin and whiskey. Excise taxes are paid when purchases are made on a specific good and often included in the price of the product. The distillery innovation and excise tax reform act unveiled tuesday would drop the current tax rate for distilled spirits from $ 13.50 per proof gallon to $ 2.70 per proof gallon on the first 10,000 gallons of productions for all distillers and then $ 9 per proof gallon after that. In a news release citing the distilled spirits council and the american craft spirits association, young said more than half the purchase price of a bottle of spirits is used for taxes and fees, making it one of the most heavily taxed products in the country. \"all around southern indiana, many new craft distilleries are popping up, creating jobs and adding to the tax base, \" young said. \"but there's a lot of red tape involved in getting a new distillery off the ground and this bill helps reduce that burden. \" rep. John yarmuth ( d-ky. ) is co-sponsoring the legislation.

A smartphone app would then act as pathologist, interpreting the data as it comes in. At this stage of development, the monitor tracks four biomarkers in sweat ( including electrolytes like sodium and metabolites like glucose ), and it incorporates a temperature sensor. These biomarkers can all hint at the early onset of issues, such as dehydration, muscle cramping, and stress in certain parts of the body, while future add-ons could expand the monitoring to many other parts of one's physical well-being in real time. \" the long term goal is to see if we can work with minimum amount of body liquid, so you won't need to exercise for the monitor to work, \" says lead author ali javey. While commercialization is still a bit down the road, one expert not involved with the research applauds the gains, writing in nature's news &amp; views: \" making a wearable band that electrochemically senses sweat analytes is extremely difficult. \" ( have you seen this wearable tech wig? )",

Bezos ' net worth climbed to $ 90.9 billion about 10am edt thursday, putting him ahead of gates at $ 90.7 billion, per bloomberg. It's possible that amazon shares will retreat or microsoft's will rally and put gates back on top by the close of business, but even if so, it would be just a matter of time before bezos reclaims the spot on a more permanent basis, notes cnbc. Forbes agrees with the new no. 1 ranking, but adds an asterisk of sorts: gates, 61, had given away about $ 31 billion of his personal fortune by the end of 2016, while the 53-year-old bezos ' philanthropy was closer to $ 100 million by the close of 2015.

The stations included the pan-arab news channel al jazeera and well-known local satellite stations. The move reflected the elevated tensions in the country since fighting erupted last week between shiite muslim-led security forces and sunni arab protesters, raising fears of a new civil war like the one that erupted from 2005 to 2008, when u.s. Troops were still in the country. The ban was announced on state television and letters of notification were delivered to the television companies. It was not the first time the iraqi government has shut the offices of satellite channels, including al jazeera and a well-known local station, al sharqiya. Similar closures occurred during the american occupation. The accusation by the government's media regulator came after a swat team, reporting to the prime minister's office, stormed a protest camp in hawija in northern iraq and opened fire. The commission announced that al jazeera, al sharqiya and eight other channels, only one of which was shiite, had been ordered to stop operations. \" the last two days the killing and sectarian actions happened because of the satellite channels encouraging and pushing them, \" said mujahid",

A memo from a campaign aide and included in campaign chair john podesta's hacked emails reads: \" our dealings with party leadership have been marked by challenges, often requiring multiple meetings and phone calls to resolve relatively simple matters. \" the campaign thought about forcing wasserman schultz out at the convention or taking away her powers and leaving her as a figurehead or co-chair. It turns out they didn't have to do either, as wasserman schutlz resigned on her own after other leaked emails showed the party secretly backing clinton over sanders when it was supposed to remain neutral, according to the hill. Meanwhile, other emails leaked tuesday feature podesta saying the campaign is \" going to have to dump all those emails \" after the new york times broke the story about clinton and aides using private accounts. And while many are using this as evidence the campaign wanted to hide evidence, the washington post reports context within the email exchange makes it clear that wasn't the case. Rather, it appears podesta was advocating for making the emails public, using a phrasing similar to \" the typical dc usage of ' friday news dump. ' \" in fact, the email exchange references a crisis management specialist who advises people in scandals to \" get the facts out \" and had advised the clinton campaign to do just that.",

Lloyd webber says brightman was \" great with the kids, \" who were 5 and 3 at the time, but \" it was a horrible year \" when he moved out and started seeing them just every third weekend. The marriage wasn't to last; they had divorced by 1990. Unmasked was released tuesday.",

The ap reports that the 400-mile wide storm, which hit the tampa bay area early monday with heavy rain and winds of up to 85mph, is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it moves over northern florida and southern georgia on monday. \" i've not heard of catastrophic damage, \" florida emergency management director bryan koon said late sunday. \" it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It means it hasn't gotten to us yet. \" the latest: some 650,000 tampa bay homes and businesses lost power overnight, adding to a total of more than 3.5 million across florida, the tampa bay times reports. Tampa is considered exceptionally vulnerable to storm surges, and mayor bob buckhorn warned sunday that the city will be \" inundated with unprecedented amounts of water. \" abc news reports that the death toll from the storm in florida is now at least five, including a person found dead in a home in the florida keys early monday. The other four died in hurricane-related car and truck crashes. In miami, the storm surge was smaller than earlier forecasts suggested but it was still enough to turn streets into rivers, the miami herald reports. The high winds toppled at least two construction cranes in the city and another in fort lauderdale. Naples, fla., was among the areas where water receded from the coast, drawn off by the power of the hurricane in what is known as a \" negative surge, \" the new york times reports. \" do not go in. The water will surge back &amp; could overtake you, \" warned gov. Rick scott. The guardian reports that as irma moves north, police in miami and other cities have warned people to stay indoors until the streets can be cleared of downed power lines. Dozens of people were arrested for looting in miami and fort lauderdale during the storm, including nine people in fort lauderdale captured on local 10 news footage walking out of shoe stores with stolen items. In orlando, the fire department began responding to a backlog of emergency calls at 5am following an eight-hour lockdown during the strongest winds, the orlando sentinel reports.

The new york daily news reports zimmerman — who was acquitted of killing black teenager trayvon martin in 2012 — tweeted two topless photos of a woman he says is his ex-girlfriend to his more than 15,000 followers on thursday. \" this is heather. She cheated on me with a dirty muslim. She ' ll sleep with anyone, \" the daily dot quotes the first tweet as saying; the tweet included a phone number apparently belonging to heather. In a second tweet, zimmerman accused heather of stealing cash and a gun from him and included an email address. The daily dot reports it's clear zimmerman's tweets violated twitter's anti-abuse policies — by including personal information and \" intimate photos \" without consent — but they may also have violated florida law. In october, florida became one of 26 states to specifically outlaw \" revenge porn, \" according to the daily news. A university of miami law professor tells the daily dot the photos may not be \" sexually explicit \" enough to violate the new law — which she calls \" deeply flawed \" — but the tweets may still run afoul of anti-stalking laws. Zimmerman is no stranger to twitter controversy, according to the daily news. In the past few months alone, he retweeted a photo of martin's body, went on a homophobic rant, and called obama a racist. ( and he's apparently making some serious enemies. )",

While not many details are yet available on the suspects, they're believed to have worked with megrahi in carrying out the attack, per a scottish crown office spokesman. Megrahi claimed innocence until his 2012 death from cancer, three year after he was released on compassionate grounds from a scottish jail due to his illness, per reuters. Last december, scotland's head prosecutor noted that while there wasn't any new evidence to vindicate megrahi, it had been difficult to track down any new suspects due to ongoing turmoil in libya after the 2011 death of leader moammar gadhafi, the news agency notes. But even some of the lockerbie victims ' families believed megrahi and supported him as he tried to appeal his case, which is leading to some skepticism about these two new suspects, the ap reports. \" many in this country simply don't believe megrahi was involved and that this was a miscarriage of justice, \" the father of one of the victims tells the bbc. \" to try and bolt two more names on top of that is a very difficult situation. It will need to be supported by better evidence than was produced to achieve the conviction of megrahi. \" ( an iranian spy says his country was actually behind the bombing, not libya. )",

Now the team's special counsel says the investigation may lead to criminal charges or civil actions, including manslaughter, the detroit news reports. \" we're here to investigate what possible crimes there are, anything [ from ] the involuntary manslaughter or death that may have happened to some young person or old person because of this poisoning, to misconduct in office, \" todd flood said tuesday. At least nine people have died in flint from legionnaires'disease since the city's water switch-over in 2014, and it wouldn't be \" far-fetched \" for involuntary manslaughter charges to arise if those deaths or others are connected to \" gross negligence \" or \" breach of duty, \" flood told reporters. He also noted he could seek restitution for residents by going after private companies and government entities that may have contributed to the crisis. But not everyone is so sure this is a great idea — or on the up-and-up. Some state lawmakers are complaining about the cost of the probe ( each team member is getting an hourly rate between $ 20 and $ 400 ), and others are suspicious of the team's agenda, including that of flood, who's contributed money to both schuette and gov. Rick snyder. \" bill schuette's ' independent investigation'seems more focused on rewarding campaign contributors with state contracts than getting to the bottom of why flint's water was poisoned with lead, \" common cause michigan's director said in a statement, per the news. But schuette is moving forward. \" to try to capture in words the tragedy of what occurred in flint is almost beyond description. \" schuette said. \" my job as attorney general is to enforce the law, and we're going to determine what laws were violated. \" ( the washington post documents some of the finger-pointing that's been going on. )",

        "summary": "Over four days in early may, three dead great white sharks washed ashore in south africa — with their livers missing. Researchers with the dyer island conservation trust did necropsies and came to the conclusion that, based on the sharks ' injuries, orcas likely killed them and ate their livers, the researchers write on the marine dynamics blog. In the case of one of the sharks, the heart was also eaten. As livescience explains, it's not unprecedented for killer whales to hunt great whites, but it's also not known to be typical. Orcas are known, however, to hunt broadnose sevengill sharks and eat their livers, and other marine mammals — including sea lions — are known to hunt smaller sharks and eat their livers and other organs, leaving the rest of the carcass behind. What's so appealing about the liver? sharks don't have a swim bladder to keep them buoyant, so they have \" very large \" livers that are filled with fats to give them buoyancy, a biologist explains. The livers are also \" very energy- and nutrient-rich, \" he says. As newsweek explains, they also contain high levels of squalene, a hydrocarbon used to produce steroids and hormones.",

All of these sharks were mysteriously missing their livers, necropsies ( animal autopsies ) showed. Now, a fourth dead, liverless shark has washed ashore, according to a post today ( june 26 ) on the marine dynamics blog, a site hosted by a shark cage diving company.

Prior to this shocking finding, there were no records of killer whales going after great white sharks in this region, though it has been documented elsewhere in a few rare incidents. Orcas are one of the most versatile and fearsome predators in the world, known to eat various types of sharks, seals and whales. But they usually avoid great whites.

Two-thirds say they'd back huckabee, followed by mitt romney ( 59 % ), and newt gingrich ( 54 % ). Democratic voters apparently have no trouble with president obama's cross-aisle deals: 78 % want him to run again, while 19 % want someone else — the lowest negative figure since the question was first asked in march. Bonus poll: a separate survey by public policy polling shows palin with surprisingly negative numbers in alaska, even among republicans. Some quick analyses of the numbers: huck's for real: it's easy to dismiss huckabee as having too narrow an appeal, writes steve kornacki at salon, \" but it's getting harder to ignore the polls. \" his numbers could fade quickly if he decides to run, but for now, he deserves the \" front-runner \" label as much as anyone. Mitt's the real winner: \" given that this poll makes huckabee more likely to run and thus to split the social conservative vote with palin, you know who these numbers really benefit? \" asks allahpundit at hot air.

A pbs newshour story on x-ray body scanners, reported in conjunction with propublica, aired on dec. 1. On sept. 23, 1998, a panel of radiation safety experts gathered at a hilton hotel in maryland to evaluate a new device that could detect hidden weapons and contraband. The machine, known as the secure 1000, beamed x-rays at people to see underneath their clothing. One after another, the experts convened by the food and drug administration raised questions about the machine because it violated a longstanding principle in radiation safety — that humans shouldn't be x-rayed unless there is a medical benefit. \"i think this is really a slippery slope, \" said jill lipoti, who was the director of new jersey's radiation protection program. The device was already deployed in prisons; what was next, she and others asked — courthouses, schools, airports? \"i am concerned … with expanding this type of product for the traveling public, \" said another panelist, stanley savic, the vice president for safety at a large electronics company. \"i think that would take this thing"

Last year, almost half of the money raised by the president's re-election campaign came from donors who gave $ 200 or less in total, a new report from the campaign finance institute shows. In 2007, by comparison, just 22 % of the $ 96.7 million he raised came from donations of $ 200 or less.

Schmitt — who hunts for treasure from the vessel aarrr booty with his parents, his wife, and his sister — will split the haul with the state of florida and the company 1715 fleet — queens jewels llc, which owns the rights to the wreckage, reports reuters. The company's president tells florida today that the find was made last month but he decided to hold the news until the anniversary of the fleet's sinking was near, and the schmitts have been \" beside themselves \" keeping it a secret.

Doug nash says he and his wife, sylvia nash ( or sylvia fink, per a march washington post article ), were on a sailing trip around the world in 2009 when they stopped in the vanuatu islands. It was there they ran into other travelers hawking an anti-malaria concoction, and after purchasing a sample of miracle mineral solution, or mms, sylvia tried it. Right away, things went wrong. \" she said, ' oh my god, that's awful, \" doug says, recalling that about 15 minutes after her negative taste test, sylvia started complaining about not feeling well. By evening, her symptoms — diarrhea, vomiting, nausea — had become so bad, doug suspected she'd been poisoned. His 56-year-old wife died before help could arrive. The autopsy noted she had ingested sodium chlorite ( mms ' main ingredient ), which is basically industrial bleach, federal prosecutors say. \" they might as well be selling clorox, \" the doj's ben mizer tells abc. The \" healing \" medicine was traced back to a firm called project greenlife, and in 2015, operator louis daniel smith was convicted and sentenced to four-plus years in prison for hawking the product as a cure for a variety of maladies. But the genesis church founded by jim humble — an elderly man who says he came from another galaxy, per the post — has built up its following around mms and claims thousands of success stories. Making things harder for the feds: supplements like this aren't fda-regulated. Meanwhile, its promoters keep pushing it. \" if they do lock me up, i know how to do out-of-body travel. I can go anywhere, see anything i want to see, \" one of the church's \" bishops \" told the post. ( an \" elixir of long life \"? )",

In another sign of heightened public interest, the court was taking the rare step of making an audio recording of the proceedings available just hours after the arguments. The last time the court did that was for gay marriage arguments in 2015. A decision on the travel ban is expected by late june.",

        "summary": "It's perfectly legal for companies to refuse to hire someone based solely on the fact they have dreadlocks, according to an 11th us circuit court of appeals ruling last week. The huffington post reports the incident started in 2010 when a woman named chastity jones had her job offer from alabama's catastrophe management solutions rescinded when she refused to change her hairstyle. A white hr manager told her dreadlocks \" tend to get messy \" and violate company policy, according to nbc news. The equal employment opportunity commission filed a lawsuit on behalf of jones in 2013, alleging that catastrophe violated title vii of the civil rights act. Last week, the court of appeals ruled 3-0 that it did not. It came down to the difference between \" immutable and mutable characteristics of race, \" judge adalberto jordan wrote in the decision. In the past, courts have ruled title vii only applies to characteristics of race that aren't changeable. \" for example, discrimination on the basis of black hair texture is prohibited by title vii, while adverse action on the basis of black hairstyle is not, \" jordan writes. The eeoc argues this interpretation ignores that race is a \" social construct \" with \" no biological definition. \" jordan says the way title vii is applied may change in the future, but his court isn't the place to do it, the wall street journal reports. In the meantime, we hope adam duritz doesn't have to look for work anytime soon. ( here's how the military feels about dreadlocks. )",

Attorney's office in oregon. A corvallis man, thinking he was going to ignite a bomb, drove a van to the corner of the square at southwest yamhill street and sixth avenue and attempted to detonate it. However, the supposed explosive was a dummy that fbi operatives supplied to him, according to an affidavit in support of a criminal complaint signed friday night by u.s. Magistrate judge john v. Acosta. Mohamed osman mohamud, 19, a somali-born u.s. Citizen, was arrested at 5: 42 p.m., 18 minutes before the tree lighting was to occur, on an accusation of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. The felony charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. The arrest was the culmination of a long-term undercover operation, during which mohamud had been monitored for months as his alleged bomb plot developed. \" the device was in fact inert, and the public was never in danger, \" according to a news release from the u.s.

In order to grow economically, the country needs \"low tax rates and sound money. \" cain, not surprisingly, thinks his 9-9-9 tax plan addresses the first ingredient, while the gold standard addresses the second. It's not perfect, but it's the best alternative we have to fix the economy. Since the gold standard was ended in 1971, the federal reserve has been manipulating the value of the dollar via interest rates and other means. But why should the value of the dollar be so flexible when one hour is always 60 minutes and one foot is always 12 inches? when the dollar was defined as a fixed amount of gold, \"economic growth was stronger, unemployment rates lower, the price level more stable, and recessions less frequent and less severe, \" cain writes. He argues that the american people and the political center are slowly coming over to his side on this issue ( although gawker clearly is not convinced ), but he predicts a long fight.
