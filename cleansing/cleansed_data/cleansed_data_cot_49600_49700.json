Sam perone, now 68, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter tuesday, admitting that he shot 41-year-old richard woods in 1992, reports the dayton daily news. Perone had been a suspect from the start, given that woods had visited his store on the night he disappeared on perone's request. His body was found a month later in a ravine near perone's store in lebanon. Blood stains found in the store were inconclusive at the time, but detectives used more modern techniques to id woods ' blood in both the store and at perone's home. Perone was arrested in arizona last year and extradited to ohio. It's a \" small measure of justice, \" woods ' widow and the mother of his four children told the judge, per the ap. She called perone a \" bad man \" who had threatened her husband before his murder. The judge sentenced perone to 11 years in prison, with credit for the year he's been in custody. Wcpo describes woods as having been a successful salesman who'd made his name in the furniture industry, and authorities chalked up the motive to what the washington post calls \" professional jealousy. \" the newspaper notes that perone's wife was heard on a wiretap saying to her husband, \" if you go down, i go down, \" but under perone's plea agreement, she won't be prosecuted.

            "A florida jury today ordered gawker media to pay $ 115 million for publishing a sex tape showing terry bollea, also known as hulk hogan, having sex with his friend's wife. The stunning sum, which may have punitive damages added to it, is a life-threatening event for the new york-based network of news and gossip sites. Gawker media was one of the first successful, large, digital-only news companies. The final sum is even more than the $ 100 million bollea was seeking. Bollea also sued gawker founder nick denton and former editor albert daulerio, and the jury found those two men personally liable as well. The sex tape was made about a decade ago, during a period in which the professional wrestler hogan testified that he was going through a difficult phase with his then-wife.

            "The jury in hulk hogan's invasion of privacy suit against gawker media awarded the ex-wrestler $ 115 million on friday. The six person jury in st. Petersburg, florida -- four women and two men -- deliberated for nearly six hours. Hogan, dressed all in black including a black bandana, cried when the verdict was announced. The ex-wrestler, whose real name is terry bollea, had sued gawker, founder nick denton and former editor a.j. Daulerio for posting the nearly two-minute segment of a hogan sex tape in 2012. Hogan's suit claimed gawker violated his privacy and sought $ 100 million. \" mr. Bollea is exceptionally happy. This is not only his victory today, but also anyone else who's been victimized by tabloid journalism, \" his lawyer david houston said outside the courtroom.

        "summary": "The house majority leader who used to cozy up to upstart tea party candidates has been crushed in his gop primary by a little-known challenger from the movement, and analysts say america's political landscape is looking very different this morning. \" the biggest congressional upset in modern memory \" will have far-reaching consequences, including the death of immigration reform, predicts chris cillizza at the washington post, noting that rival david brat savaged cantor for allegedly supporting an amnesty and other republicans are now extremely unlikely to go out on a limb to support any elements of reform. House legislative activity is also likely to grind to a halt as republicans become terrified of doing anything that could be used against them in primaries still to come, cillizza writes — not that there were many \" grand legislative plans \" anyway. The defeat of the house majority leader isn't just rare, it's completely unprecedented in the history of the office, alexandra jaffe at the hill finds. Since the office was created in 1899, there were 55 successful renomination bids before last night — and until cantor's loss, house majority leaders were more likely to die than be defeated. With cantor out, tim alberta at the national journal predicts that speaker john boehner and majority whip kevin mccarthy could be next as conservative house gopers push \" for a wholesale change in leadership. \" he says that soon after cantor's defeat, one conservative lawmaker told him, \" they haven't been conservative enough. We've told them that for three years. They wouldn't listen. \" cantor's defeat is a bad omen for moderates and is \" mildly shakespearian \" in light of his early support for tea party candidates, write jonathan weisman and jennifer steinhauer at the new york times. But they suggest there could be more than policy behind his defeat. A house political analyst at the nonpartisan cook political report says cantor — the most senior jewish lawmaker in congressional history — \" was culturally out of step with a redrawn district that was more rural, more gun-oriented, and more conservative. \" cantor's religion, he says, was \" the elephant in the room. \" click for more on the man who handed cantor his stunning loss.",

In paddington 2, he gets a job so he can buy a rare book for his aunt but is wrongly imprisoned for its theft before the transaction can take place. According to critics — who give it a 100 % rating on rotten tomatoes — this is not a film to miss. \" the movie is full of bright wit and sincere joy, as paddington's innate kindness permeates all around him, providing a weary world just what it needs right now, \" writes sean p. Means at the salt lake tribune. But much more than \" a warm bear hug, \" the film delivers fun \" by the bucketful \" and leaves no stone unturned \" if there's a clever joke to be found under it. \" in other words, it's \" completely delightful. \" \" what a pleasant surprise, \" bruce demara writes at the toronto star. Blending \" seamlessly \" with its predecessor, paddington 2 is \" family-friendly fun for all ages, thanks to a marvelous script, a sterling cast and the adept, sure-handed direction of paul king, \" demara writes. He was especially impressed with \" a sublime pop-up animation scene that demonstrates king's copious attention to detail, \" but says the whole film is \" visually lovely. \" \" we ' ll be hard-pressed to find a more delightful film in all of 2018, \" adam graham puts it at the detroit news. \" the whole enterprise is so whimsical and, well, british, that it feels like being whisked away to a different place, \" he writes. \" if you have kids, take them. If you have nieces and nephews, take them. If you don't have kids but just want to feel like one yourself, go see it, \" he adds. \" two paws up. \" justin chang, too, notes this is not just a film for kids. It keeps the \" gently whimsical, thoroughly british spirit of michael bond's original books \" and \" wraps you in its own warm embrace from start to finish, \" but is also \" full of inspired blink-and-you-miss-it wordplay, \" he writes at the los angeles times, also applauding hugh grant's \" terrifically self-skewering \" performance and the \" marvelously intricate \" production design.",

The story dovetails seamlessly with the first paddington in 2014, based on the beloved children's books of michael bond about an orphaned peruvian bear who finds a home in london, where he manages to spread loads of joy to those around him along with a little unintended mayhem. Uncle pastuzo is gone so paddington is desperate to give dear aunt lucy back home a particularly special gift for her 100th birthday, and what better than a pop-up book of london landmarks he finds in the old curiosity shop of mr. Gruber ( jim broadbent )? but the book, which paddington is saving up to buy in his new job as a window washer — a task he really puts his back into — has also drawn the interest of a has-been actor phoenix buchanan, who sees in it a treasure map to a fortune that can bankroll his long-awaited comeback. In pursuit of the thief, paddington is collared and sentenced to prison by a gruff and grudge-bearing judge ( tom conti ), a previous victim of paddington's well but misguided intentions. You wouldn't imagine a bear in the big house would be fertile ground for comedy but in this instance, you would be mistaken. And with paddington doing hard time, it's up to the brown family to track down the real thief."

Egyptologists from switzerland's university of basel have since 2015 been studying what a press release calls an \" ancient egyptian elite cemetery \" near luxor, and one of its finds was small but big: one of the oldest prosthetic devices ever found, which served to replace the right foot's big toe and was made with incredible skill. The 3,000-year-old prosthesis was discovered in the upper-class tomb of a priest's daughter at plundered burial site sheikh ' abd el-qurna and has now been re-examined. Not only is it attractive and functional, but \" the mobility of the prosthetic extension and the robust structure of the belt strap \" show it was made by an artisan who was \" very familiar \" with the human form. At the conversation, jane draycott of the university of glasgow notes prostheses have also been found in ancient greece, and advancements in this field likely followed war as soldiers with missing extremities returned home. It isn't clear what happened to the priest's daughter, but researchers believe her toe was amputated and a pricey prosthetic fitted in its place. Using microscopy and x-rays, they determined the wooden toe was actually refitted at least three times, per upi. It shows \" she had a certain living standard, \" researcher andrea loprieno-gnirs tells swiss info. Ancient egyptians \" often wore sandals, so you can imagine that a well-formed foot was important, \" she adds, calling the prosthetic an \" extraordinary \" and \" sensational find. \" ( these mummy legs might belong to a royal. )",

Jürgen kantner and sabine merz — who were held by somali pirates for 52 days in 2008, until a six-figure ransom was reportedly paid — were seized by abu sayyaf militants in the southern philippines on saturday, the new york times reports. Merz fired at the militants, and \" our men shot back and killed her, \" an abu sayyaf spokesman told the philippine daily inquirer over the phone. A man who identified himself as kantner then came on the line claiming, \" pirates took our boat and they took us. \" abu sayyaf militants also killed two canadians earlier this year. The german foreign ministry says it's investigating the reports but hasn't confirmed the abduction or merz's death. However, the philippine military released a photo of the attacked boat, recovered on sunday, which shows it to be the same 30-foot yacht, dubbed the rockall, that was seized by pirates in 2008. A military rep says a woman's naked body was also found on board bearing \" gunshot wounds \" and signs of a sexual assault. \" a shotgun was also recovered beside the woman's body, \" the rep says. A year after their first abduction, kantner told the afp that he would keep sailing, but \" i pray to god that pirates won't get me again.

Chancellor angela merkel - whose party topped the poll in germany - described the far right victories as \" remarkable and regrettable \" and said the best response was to boost economic growth and jobs.

But fringe forces will gain a larger platform to promote their hostility to the bureaucracy in brussels and to immigrants in their home countries. Leaders of some of the mainstream parliamentary parties held out hope that voters'drift to extremist parties could be reversed. \"this is a bad day for the european union when the party with such an openly racist, xenophobic and anti-semitic program gets 25 or 24 percent of the vote in france, \" martin schulz, the current president of the european parliament and the socialist contender to"

Patriots day, an absorbing and detail-rich account of the terrorist bombing of the 2013 boston marathon and the four-day manhunt that followed, marks the third time in three years that director peter berg and star mark wahlberg have collaborated to dramatize recent history. ( deepwater horizon, their thriller about the 2010 transocean oil spill in the gulf of mexico, came out all of four months ago. ) this time, wahlberg plays boston police sergeant tommy saunders, a detective who, as a final act of penance for some never-explicated transgression that got him suspended, happens to be posted in uniform ( \" the clown suit, \" he calls it ) at the finish line when the two bombs go off. ( berg shot some scenes at the 2016 boston marathon, though not his reenactment of the bombings, obviously. ) somehow every cop in the city, including the commissioner of police himself, knows tommy well enough to call out his name when they see him, but there's no reason why you should remember it: unlike the people played by the other a-listers in the film's sprawling cast, saunders is fictitious",

        "summary": "An unarmed missile capable of sending a nuclear bomb across the world was launched wednesday from a california military base amid rising tensions between the us and north korea. The unarmed minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off from a silo at 12: 02am from vandenberg air force base and delivered a single re-entry vehicle to a target about 4,200 miles away at kwajalein atoll in the pacific ocean, the air force global strike command said. The test took 10 months to plan. It was the latest aimed at checking the readiness and accuracy of a weapon system that forms part of the us nuclear force. The us has about 450 of the missiles. Each can travel about 8,000 miles. It was the second such launch in seven days, the ap reports. The launches came amid us expressions of concern about north korea's nuclear capability. Per the los angeles times, the air force said the purpose of wednesday's test was to ensure the missile is reliable and can function as an \" effective nuclear deterrent. \" new missile tests by north korea and its progress toward developing a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the us have made it one of the top us national security concerns. The us has sent warships to the region to deter north korea from conducting another nuclear test. But president trump on monday said he might be willing to meet with kim jong un. \" if it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, i would absolutely, i would be honored to do it, \" trump told bloomberg news.",

She's been climbing since she was 6 and nabbed top honors in national and world rock-climbing championships, cbs notes. Yet she still gets discouragement on her attempt, which she hopes to complete next week. \" people saying like, ' little girls don't belong on the eiger, ' \" she told cbs last night in a video chat from the mountain. Not that it's stopped her, even with unpredictable weather and 12- to 18-hour days. \" i think that fear is inevitable, but i don't think that fear needs to be inhibiting, \" she says. She also keeps in mind her late dad's advice ( \" have fun, be safe, and do your best \" ) and her dream to be a female pioneer. \" when other women open the floodgates to showing that something is possible, then all of a sudden you see progression in a sport, \" she notes.

Some of the non-beef ingredients \" do have weird names, \" but all of them are \" completely safe and approved by the fda, \" taco bell explains on a new page titled, \" what are those other ingredients? \" the page goes on to explain each ingredient, like so: \" isn't cellulose a fancy term for wood? \" it asks, and then answers, \" cellulose is a safe carbohydrate found in the cell walls of plants and helps with water and oil binding. \" other weirdly named ingredients are used to improve taste ( trehalose, maltodextrin, and torula yeast ), reduce sodium levels ( potassium chloride, a common salt substitute ), and bind the finished product together ( soy lecithin ), among other things. And then, of course, there are less-weird ingredients, like salt, pepper, and spices — although the huffington post finds it odd that one of the ingredients is \" a black pepper flavor, \" rather than simply \" black pepper. \" what about fillers? the company says it doesn't use any, and the oats that are included in the ingredient list simply help keep the beef moist. As for the 88 % of the beef that is actually beef, no, it is not \" grade d \" — in fact, taco bell notes, there is no such usda beef grade. \" we use the same quality beef used in all ground beef ( like you'd find in the grocery store ), \" the page reads. So should you keep eating at taco bell? a chemist tells abc news, \" there's nothing on this list i have a problem eating. \" but business insider offers a caveat: the ingredients listed are still high in sodium and fat, and most of them are, of course, processed.

Many of these procedures are done with the stated aim of making it easier for children to grow up \"normal \" and integrate more easily into society by helping them conform to a particular sex assignment. The results are often catastrophic, the supposed benefits are largely unproven, and there are generally no urgent health considerations at stake. Procedures that could be delayed until intersex children are old enough to decide whether they want them are instead performed on infants who then have to live with the consequences for a lifetime.

And on tuesday, human rights watch and interact a group advocating for intersex youth — are releasing a detailed report assailing the practice and urging congress to ban it. \" the results are often catastrophic, \" says the report, asserting that the surgeries \" can inflict irreversible physical and psychological harm. \" \" the pressure to fit in and live a ' normal ' life is real, \" said kyle knight, a human rights watch researcher who wrote the report. \" but there is no evidence that surgery delivers on the promise of making that easier. \" one of multiple reasons for the concern: some intersex children may undergo",
            "Summary reader advisory: this report contains graphic descriptions of traumatic experiences, often affecting children. Intersex people in the united states are subjected to medical practices that can inflict irreversible physical and psychological harm on them starting in infancy, harms that can last throughout their lives. Many of these procedures are done with the stated aim of making it easier for children to grow up \"normal \" and integrate more easily into society by helping them conform to a particular sex assignment. The results are often catastrophic, the supposed benefits are largely unproven, and there are generally no urgent health considerations at stake. Procedures that could be delayed until intersex children are old enough to decide whether they want them are instead performed on infants who then have to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Video: end irreversible genital surgeries on intersex infants in the us doctors in the united states continue to perform medically unnecessary surgeries that can inflict permanent harm on intersex children. Intersex people are not rare, but they are widely misunderstood. Biology classes often oversimplify a fundamental reality. We are taught that sex is dimorphic: simply male or female. But sex, in reality, is a spectrum — with the majority of humans appearing to exist at one end or the other. In fact, as many as 1.7 percent of babies are different from what is"

And though allrecipes ' users — it's the most trafficked english-language food site — typically want quick and easy meals, chandler's 21-ingredient dish, with its 3-plus-hour prep and cooking time and a cost the post estimates at $ 40, has somehow persisted as the exception. With its 8,856 five-star reviews, it's certainly a big hit, though there are detractors ( \" amy \" described it as being \" runny and not worth the trouble to make... I ' ll stick to stouffer's from now on \" ).

Amid tight security, asia bibi left a detention facility in punjab province for the flight to the capital, the officials said. Troops guarded the roads leading to the airport from which she departed, they said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity wednesday as they were not authorized to speak to media on the record. Authorities last month said they arrested two prisoners for allegedly conspiring to strangle her and since then additional police and troops have been deployed to the facility in punjab. Officials said bibi will be safer at the new facility in islamabad, the ap reports. Bibi's transfer comes a week after the high court in a landmark ruling acquitted bibi and ordered her released, a move that triggered nationwide protests. Bibi's release was put on hold friday after authorities held talks with radical islamists who want her publicly hanged. Bibi was arrested in 2009 on charges of insulting islam's prophet and she was sentenced to death in 2010. Her lawyer said wednesday she had been released from jail but was still in protective custody, per the guardian. Her husband says the family is in danger remaining in pakistan and is seeking asylum elsewhere, but authorities now say bibi may not leave the country because a petition for a review of the court's ruling was filed by a radical islamist lawyer requesting the acquittal be reversed. Pakistani courts usually take years to decide such cases. ( italy is working to help. )",

With a little investigating, however, a diver with the buckskin fire department uncovered a scene much more comical than grisly, the arizona republic reports: two fake skeletons wearing sunglasses, sitting peacefully in lawn chairs attached to rocks on the riverbed. In a statement, per nbc news, the la paz county sheriff's office said the scene looked rather like \" an underwater tea party. \" officer curtis bagby tells the ap the stunt was probably just a practical joke. \" i don't think they were trying to set up anything to scare anyone, \" he says. A sign with the skeletons includes the words \" bernie \" and \" dream in the river, \" which bagby says could be a reference to the movie weekend at bernie's; in one scene in the film, the corpse of a man named bernie falls into the water from a boat. The sign was also dated aug. 16, 2014, which may indicate when the skeleton tea party began. Authorities will crash the party at some point this week, though, as they plan to remove the plastic skeletons and chairs from the river. Bagby says they may even find a new home outside the sheriff's department. \" we like to show some things that are fun, some levity, too, \" he says.

Rumors that the elusive particle believed to endow matter with mass has been spotted have circulated before, but experts believe confirmation of its existence may finally be unveiled at the european research lab next week, when teams that have trawled data from 350 trillion collisions release their results, the guardian reports. The teams have been gradually narrowing the energy range where the higgs may lurk, and expect to see the first glimpse within days, a top cern scientist tells the bbc. Cern's director of research is more cautious, saying only that \" indications that are not consistent with its non-existence \" may surface. \" this hunt for the higgs is like fishing in an ancient way, \" he says. \" instead of using modern tools you are removing the water from the pond. It might look tedious but it is the only way, at the end of the day, when you have removed all the water from the pond to find the smallest fish. \"",

Per cbs news, erica walker was working as a property manager with trilogy residential management at a memphis apartment complex when she told a black man to remove his socks or get out of the pool. The man's girlfriend, camry porter, took video of the incident and says she believes that walker, who is white, singled out their group because they were black. While walker also told the group that hats were not allowed at the pool, porter points out in the video that white visitors were wearing them without being questioned. At some point during the dispute, walker called the police. Rather than deal with the police, porter said she and her group, including her godchildren, whom she brought to her complex's pool to celebrate the holiday, chose to leave. Porter posted her video to facebook, where it's been viewed more than a million times. She told wreg that she wanted walker held accountable, and that appears to be what has happened. On friday, trilogy residential management released a statement confirming that walker has been fired from her job with the company. \" to confirm, ms. Walker was terminated immediately after we completed our investigation yesterday afternoon, \" the company wrote.",

        "summary": "The narrative of the last moments of michael brown's life tends to begin here: with the 18-year-old allegedly stealing cigarillos from a ferguson, missouri, convenience store shortly before he was shot dead by officer darren wilson. Now, a documentary that screened saturday at south by southwest in austin uses previously unseen surveillance footage to argue that brown did not in fact rob ferguson market and liquor, reports the st. Louis post-dispatch. The alternate story as presented in stranger fruit by jason pollock — a michael moore \" protege, \" notes the hollywood reporter: in the new footage, brown is shown arriving at the shop at 1am on aug. 9, 2014. Pollock believes brown was there to do a trade with store clerks: some marijuana in exchange for two boxes of cigarillos. The clip shows brown taking the boxes but then turning back and leaving them with the clerks, in pollock's view, to retrieve later. The surveillance footage that was widely seen in the case shows brown back at the shop just before noon, seizing the cigarillos and shoving co-owner andy patel when patel asked brown for payment ( patel wasn't working during brown's earlier visit ); a customer called 911, and brown was dead minutes later. A lawyer for the store disputes the new chain of events, telling the new york times, \" those folks didn't sell him cigarillos for pot. The reason he gave [ the cigarillos ] back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they wanted it back. \" it's unclear how pollock obtained the footage, but his reading of police records in the case, which mentioned the earlier visit, alerted him to its possible existence. Police haven't confirmed the authenticity of the video. ( here's what darren wilson's life was like one year after the shooting. )",

        "summary": "Former four-term wisconsin gov. Tommy thompson has fought off a trio of conservative challengers to win the state's gop senate primary. Thompson, george w. Bush's secretary of health and human services, will compete against democratic rep. Tammy baldwin in a race that could determine control of the senate. Thompson's rivals tried to use his history of taking moderate positions against him, but gop voters agreed that his centrism made him the most likely to defeat baldwin, who aims to become the first openly gay senator, notes the milwaukee journal sentinel. In connecticut, meanwhile, former wrestling exec linda mcmahon crushed her rival in the republican primary, setting up a showdown with rep. Chris murphy for the senate seat being vacated by joe lieberman. And in florida, veteran gop rep. John mica defeated freshman rep. Sandy adams in a race that pitted them against each other because of redistricting. Adams lost despite having the support of sarah palin and much of the tea party. And it looks like there has been an upset in another florida race, where 12-term rep. Cliff stearns is trailing tea party challenger ted yoho in their republican primary, reports the ap. Yoho, a political novice, ran an anti-incumbent campaign with one ad depicting politicians in suits eating alongside pigs in a trough.",

Both the ap and the wall street journal report that trump had grown increasingly frustrated by ethics restrictions placed on the company to avoid possible conflicts of interest while she worked in the white house; she reportedly felt the restrictions were hindering the company's ability to grow. While apparel sales at the brand were way up during the 2016 election year, it has since become fraught with controversy and hit with boycotts by those who oppose president trump. Nordstrom and other retailers have stopped selling it, citing declining sales as the reason, and still other stores have scaled back ivanka trump displays. Despite the efforts of ivanka trump, who retained her ownership interest in the company through a trust, it was challenging to keep the brand separate from her father's administration; president trump tweeted, for example, that nordstrom had treated ivanka \" so unfairly, \" and kellyanne conway came under fire for suggesting people \" go buy ivanka's stuff \" during an interview at the white house. And the company had been criticized for using chinese workers abroad to make its products, as well as for being granted trademarks by foreign governments that would want to be on president trump's good side.",

According to national geographic, a team of preservationists were lifting the statue, cristo del miserere, onto a work bench when they realized there was something inside it. The team discovered the buttocks-portion of the statue was removable and concealed a document signed in 1777 by joaquin minguez, the chaplain of the cathedral of the burgo de osma. \" although it is usual for many sculptures to be hollow, it is not so much to find handwritten documents inside, \" science alert quotes historian efren arroyo as saying. Over both sides of two pages of paper, minguez describes life in spain in the late-1700s. He talks about harvesting wheat, rye, barley, and oats and discusses the region's wine production, gizmodo reports. He names malaria and typhoid fever as dangerous afflictions and notes that entertainment is provided by \" cards, ball, bald, bar and other puerile games. \" he mentions the spanish inquisition and king carlos iii and praises manuel bal, sculptor of cristo del miserere, as a \" natural scholar. \" according to the new york post, minguez's document even names popular bullfighters of the time. Arroyo says the document appears to be an early form of time capsule. It has been archived for preservation, but a copy of minguez's writing has been reinserted into jesus ' behind for future generations.

        "summary": "Exercise dvds are a mostly unregulated industry, and their safety and accuracy haven't been scientifically proven — yet their promises of chiseled, bronzed bodies have us forking over $ 250 million for them every year. Not only do we not know whether they work, researchers at oregon state university are going so far as to report that they could be both physically and psychologically unsafe. To arrive at that conclusion they reviewed 10 popular dvds, and they write in the sociology of sport journal that 26.9 % of the words spoken during the fitness videos were motivational statements. Except one in seven of those so-called motivating statements were in fact \" negative \" in their view — i.e., \" you should be dying right now \" or \" you better be sweating. \" further, \" there are also questions about some of the exercises, which could lead to injuries and pose a real danger to the user, \" says researcher brad cardinal. The findings \" don't surprise me at all, \" certified personal trainer doug sklar, who founded the philanthrofit studio in new york, tells yahoo health, and he sums up the problem: those negative statements reinforce the idea that exercise is torture. For exercise pros, that can motivate; for newbies, it can have them heading for the hills. The key is making sure those new to working out \" find it to be a positive experience that they are more likely to continue with, \" says sklar. The researchers won't reveal which 10 videos they reviewed, but say those featuring certified trainers may have a leg up on those led by someone who just has a good body.

        "summary": "The katy perry-taylor swift feud is alive and well. Perry addressed it in late may on james corden's carpool karaoke ( indeed, vanity fair says the topic was \" the centerpiece \" of the segment ), thanks in part to the fact that she just released a song, \" swish, swish, \" that is rumored to be about swift. ( sample lyric: \" your game is tired / you should retire / you're ' bout cute as / an old coupon expired / and karma's not a liar / she keeps receipts. \" ) during the segment, perry confirmed the feud's origins do indeed have to do with backup dancers who have worked for both singers, and insists she tried to talk with swift about it but swift responded by writing a mean song about her. Now, in a new interview with nme, perry further explains why she decided to address the feud with corden in the first place. \" no one has asked me about my side of the story, and there are three sides of every story: one, two, and the truth, \" she says. She adds that, of course, she truly does want everyone to get along, \" but, i mean, i ' m not buddha — things irritate me. I wish that i could turn the other cheek every single time, but i ' m also not a pushover, you know? especially when someone tries to assassinate my character with little girls. That's so messed up! \" another interesting note on the feud: swift, who pulled her music from streaming sites including spotify in 2014, just put her entire catalog back on spotify, amazon, and tidal on thursday night — the same night perry's new album, witness, was released. Coincidence? tmz thinks not, calling it possibly \" the pettiest move — or just brilliant. \" twitter went nuts over the move, with both taylor fans and katy fans weighing in, per us.",

        "summary": "An enterprising attorney has created a portable chair that converts to a bullet-proof vest, for use in schools and entertainment venues. Aaron ansel came up with the idea for the covermeseat following the october 2017 mass shooting in las vegas. \" i just thought, is there any sort of technology-based solution that could have kept people safe? there has to be something, \" he tells newsweek. The chair, which looks like a stadium seat, has a quick-release mechanism that allows the user to unfold it, place it over the head, and cinch it at the waist, similar to an airplane life vest. A youtube video shows it stopping bullets and there's a fitted compartment for optional ballistic plates. Ansel has been criticized by those who see him as capitalizing on mass shootings, but he says the device is a practical solution to a problem that shows no sign of going away. Indeed, hundreds have died in mass shootings since the las vegas massacre and the us has suffered 57 times more school shootings than all other industrialized nations combined since 2009, cnn reports. Ansel says his typical buyer isn't the gun enthusiast. Rather, he's marketing the product to teachers and concert-goers. \" it's as apolitical as a fire extinguisher, \" he tells newsweek.",

Witnesses say the child suicide bombers — four girls and one boy — were between the ages of 9 and 15. Three of the bombs exploded at a mosque just before final evening prayers. The girl with the fourth bomb intended for the mosque ran off but died when her bomb also exploded. The fifth child suicide bomber struck the house of a vigilante leader, who was not home at the time. The bbc reports boko haram is believed to be behind the attacks thursday in maiduguri, which was the islamist militant group's original base six years ago. Boko haram is stepping up attacks against civilians as the nigerian military has begun seeing success in fighting them, according to al jazeera. A wave of attacks in maiduguri less than two weeks ago killed at least 117 people. Earlier this week, amnesty international called for greater protection for citizens from boko haram attacks.

The recent plunge in oil prices has caused a scramble for storage space, and traders are increasingly turning to offshore supertankers for storage as sites on land fill up, reports the wall street journal. Analysts say that major traders have now chartered tankers capable of holding more than 30 million barrels of oil, and they're expected to remain anchored for around a year. Floating storage carried more than 70 million barrels of oil after the oil price collapsed in 2009, although the globe and mail notes that some traders were in for a \" crude awakening \" after a surge in us shale output meant consumption from the middle east didn't rise when the economy recovered. \" if people think the contango is some kind of magical way to make money, they are incorrect, \" an analyst at mercuria energy group tells the journal. \" storing big quantities of crude oil is not an easy game.

        "summary": "You might want to start your next workout at the gym with a sniff test. A new study suggests that gyms have high levels of air pollutants such as formaldehyde, airborne dust, and carbon dioxide, reports the new york times. In fact, levels for those three substances generally exceeded accepted standards for air quality. The samples were taken at gyms in portugal, but the gyms were similar to those commonly found in the us. Researchers found particularly high levels of carbon dioxide during aerobics classes, thanks to all that huffing and puffing. But the need for better ventilation seemed clear in all areas, especially considering the physiology involved with a workout. \" when we exercise, we take in more air with each breath and most of that air goes through the mouth, bypassing the natural filtration system \" of the nostrils, says the lead researcher. \" the pollutants go deeper into the lungs compared to resting situations. \" so what to do? the researchers stress that people shouldn't stop going to gyms, notes a blog post at shape. But they might want to sniff their gym's air, and if it has a stale or chemical odor, ask the manager about ventilation or the most recent air-quality test. Beyond that, exercisers could make a point to go at less-crowded times, suggests men's fitness. ( exercise might be bad for your teeth, too. )",

There was a mysterious blast in the capital, managua, late saturday night, and government scientists believe it's connected to asteroid 2014 rc, reports reuters. The explosion left a crater 40 feet wide and 16 feet deep on the outskirts of the city, near the airport. Government scientists say they believe it was caused by a \" relatively small \" meteorite and they plan to ask international experts for help, the ap reports. \" it could have come off that asteroid because it is normal for that to occur. We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock, \" a nicaraguan volcanologist tells the bbc. At its closest, the asteroid came within around 25,000 miles of earth — a tenth of the distance to the moon — and \" its orbit will bring it back to our planet's neighborhood in the future, \" according to nasa, which says \" the asteroid's future motion will be closely monitored, but no future threatening earth encounters have been identified. \"",

Such was the situation in ningbo, china, when on sunday a boy of that age ducked under the rope encircling a sculpture of zootopia character nick wilde and knocked it over, ruining the $ 15,000 lego fox, reports shanghaiist. It was crafted by a man identified only by his surname of zhao, who the bbc reports built the piece over the course of three days and nights out of some 10,000 pieces. The \" masterwork \" hadn't even been on display for a full hour before it was destroyed, reports what's on weibo. While zhao reportedly wrote of being \" depressed and frustrated \" in the words of the south china morning post, he noted that he had accepted the family's apology and was not looking for any compensation as the destruction wasn't intentional. But in the annals of history, the child's act will appear second to another may 2016 art mess: mashable and the bbc report that two boys visiting the shanghai museum of glass on may 17 were filmed breaking the wings off \" angel in waiting, \" a glass piece created by shelly xue over 27 months. The children were filmed by security cameras — and by the two adults accompanying them, who recorded the boys ' actions on cellphones. Last august, a 12-year-old taking a guided tour with his mom at an art exhibit in taipei tripped next to a painting worth about $ 1.5 million, putting his fist right through it as he tried to break his fall. He left a large gash in the bottom right of paolo porpora's flowers, an oil on canvas said to be about 350 years old. The painting was said to be the only one signed by porpora.

He's referring to the mit professor and obamacare architect who suggested in a recently surfaced video from 2013 that the \" stupidity of the american voter \" helped get the law passed. First, the offending quote from gruber: \"lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the american voter, or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass. \" in a column at fox news, kurtz blasts mainstream media outlets, which usually salivate over a good hidden-video story, for ignoring this one. \" this is utterly inexplicable, except as a matter of bias, \" he writes. \" no matter what you think of obamacare, on what planet is this not news? \" the story is getting harder to ignore, however: gruber has conceded to msnbc that he \" spoke inappropriately, \" the white house today denounced the comments, and yet another video ( the fourth, actually ) has surfaced. In this one, gruber is quoted as saying that president obama \" knew when he was running for president that quite frankly the american public doesn't actually care that much about the uninsured. \" that's why even though the bill is \" 90 % health insurance coverage and 10 % about cost control, all you ever hear people talk about is cost control. \" this one is being reported by cnn, the very definition of mainstream media.

Abstract the accidental ingestion of a foreign object often presents a difficult scenario for the clinician. This includes not only the decision to retrieve the material but also the appropriate technique to use. We present the case of a young asymptomatic girl who swallowed a magnetic activity watch, which was then successfully retrieved with an endoscopic snare. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of salvaging an operational watch from the stomach using an endoscopic technique. 1. Introduction foreign body ingestion is a challenging medical dilemma for both surgeons and gastroenterologists, with the greatest incidence seen in the psychiatric, elderly, and pediatric populations. The mechanism of ingestion varies based on the cohort studied. The psychiatric population may have an altered decision-making capability or will swallow objects for a secondary gain [ 1"

The 44-year-old used to kill spiders with hair spray and a vacuum; now, he's fine with letting them crawl all over him, medical daily reports. The reasons aren't clear, but it seems to have something to do with his amygdala, part of the brain which deals with fear. Parts of it were removed in the surgery to get rid of his seizures — which also disappeared after the operation. Interestingly, other fears remained after the surgery, including the man's fear of public speaking. This could be because arachnophobia prompts a \" quick-and-dirty panic response, \" whereas a fear of public speaking is a different, \" more nuanced \" kind of worry, an expert says. The surgery might only have operated on the \" panic \" pathway, the expert adds. On the downside, the surgery also temporarily removed the man's love for music: for a while, he was repulsed by tunes, especially one on a particular tv commercial, new scientist reports. Fortunately, that revulsion faded; meanwhile, the man could now probably handle spiders hatching in his bananas.",

Ford dropped his 2014 bid for re-election when he was diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of cancer. In a lengthy obituary, the star recounts the treatment he undertook in his quest to beat pleomorphic liposarcoma over the course of 18 months, including a may 2015 surgery, chemotherapy, and a clinical trial. It also traces his political career, from his role as a \" plain-spoken champion of the little guy, always eager to get a pothole fixed \" to his 2010 mayoral win, which ushered in a \" wild, scandal-filled term. \" as mayor, the headlines grew less positive: he was ordered removed from office in november 2012 over an alleged violation of conflict of interest rules ( an appeal court overturned it ). In may 2013 both the toronto star and gawker said they had viewed a video that showed ford smoking crack cocaine; that november he admitted that he had smoked the drug and had bought illegal drugs while in office. He was stripped of most of his powers. In october 2014, the father of two had this to say about how he would be recalled: \" people know that i saved a lot of money, and people are going to know that i had a few personal struggles.

Researchers studied the 649 languages for which growth and decline data was available to determine the leading factors driving the change, science magazine reports. In order to reach their conclusions, they turned to methods typically employed to track endangered animal populations; interestingly, the study's lead author, tatsuya amano, is a zoologist. His team examined the relationships between a language's disappearance and a country's gdp, altitude, and other possible influences. Economic growth showed the strongest correlation to the fading of a language. \" as economies develop, one language often comes to dominate a nation's political and educational spheres, \" amano says, as per the bbc. \" people are forced to adopt the dominant language or risk being left out in the cold — economically and politically. \" a quarter of the world's languages may be in danger, he notes; fewer than 25 people currently speak upper tanana in alaska, for instance.

Debra caudy, a retired medical oncologist, and her husband clay heighten, a retired emergency doctor and founder of a real estate management company, invested $ 745,000 in 2015 to purchase 29 acres of rolling meadows and woods in cross roads, texas, a suburb of dallas, and have created the nonprofit 29 acres as they seek to reach their fundraising goal of $ 12 million, reports wfaa. \" we couldn't find anything, so we just decided to do it ourselves, \" caudy tells the dallas morning news. With so many young adults like their son, she adds, \" the need is enormous. \" some estimates put half a million students with autism entering adulthood in the next decade. With 200 staff, the complex will include 15 homes, a community center, a \" transitional \" academy that teaches life and work skills to those who might be able to live independently, a bus stop, and easy access to ride-sharing for residents needing to shop, get to work, etc. The first residents are expected to move in next year.
