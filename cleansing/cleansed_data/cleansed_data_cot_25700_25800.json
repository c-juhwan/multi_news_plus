        "summary": "The death of hugo chavez has left opinions on the venezuelan leader's rule as divided as ever. His achievements in lifting millions out of poverty are sure to see him remembered as one of latin america's great socialists, but many point to his disrespect for democratic institutions and his economic mismanagement and predict his legacy will be a bitter one. \" venezuela under chavez was a glorious contradiction — an autocracy with a popular, elected megalomaniac at its center, \" writes francisco toro at the atlantic. Millions of venezuelans will sincerely mourn chavez, he writes, but as the cult of personality around him grew, he ruthlessly exploited his popularity, \" strip-mining the people's affection for the gratification of a monstrously overgrown ego and dismantling the institutions of democratic life in the process. \" \" chavez played a pivotal role in bringing the plight of latin america's impoverished people to the top of the political agenda \" and he inspired successful anti-poverty programs elsewhere, writes frida ghitis at cnn. Other latin american leaders, however, have also imitated his \" populist undemocratic style, intimidating opponents, restricting the media and subverting the judiciary, \" and he leaves behind \" a continent where alternatives to his model look more appealing than ever. \" the former paratrooper was a \" poisonous influence on the region, \" decides michael moynihan at the daily beast, pointing to chavez's intimidation of opponents, his support for dictators, and venezuela's sky-high murder rate. Chavez's reign was \" extralegal, vindictive, and interested in the short-term gesture rather than the more difficult, long-term solution, \" he writes. Chavez was loved by millions because \" he won free ( if not always fair ) elections, spent lavishly on health clinics, literacy courses and social program, slashed poverty, devolved power to communal councils, stood up to george bush over iraq, encouraged regional pride and assertiveness across latin america and did it all with charisma and flair, \" writes rory carroll at the guardian. But the country he left behind is a corrupt shambles on the verge of collapse despite a decade of record oil revenues, he writes, arguing that the \" most damning critique of chavez's rule concerned not democratic credentials but managerial competence. \"",

        "summary": "Quantity matters, at least when it comes to product reviews. New research finds that consumers are swayed by the number of reviews an item receives, even if it's of worse quality. Quartz reports that the study analyzing buying habits on amazon shows that online products with the most reviews were the most popular, even if they scored a lower rating. \" we found that people were biased toward choosing to purchase more popular products and that this sometimes led them to make very poor decisions, \" says stanford's derek powell, per a press release. After studying 15.6 million reviews of more than 350,000 amazon products, powell and his team built a statistical model mimicking how people shop. Writing in psychological science, powell's team then asked participants to choose between two products that scored the same rating of 3.1 stars, but with different review tallies — 29 for one and 154 for the other. In 90 % of the cases, participants said they'd buy the item with more reviews. The scientists found no relationship between the number of reviews and a product's average rating; there was only a 40 % chance the more popular product was rated better quality. So how do you prevent humans from using online information to make, as powell puts it, \" systematically bad decisions? \" lifehacker suggests that people actually read the content of online reviews before buying. Powell agrees that more buyer-side caution is called for, but he tips the ball back to retailers, suggesting they \" might need to rethink how reviews are presented. \" ( one confused shopper pans a weed grinder. )",

Every installment has become \" the one where x happens, \" rather than something thematically unified, and the series has simply gone for broke on big, shocking events. When you try to structure your narrative around one particular emotion, like shock, that emotion eventually loses some of its power to me, game of thrones was at its best in its second and third seasons, when it wasn't so overwhelmed"

        "summary": "A new study might throw a wrench into plans to establish a human colony on mars, whose surface is \" more uninhabitable than previously thought. \" indeed, the red planet is covered in a \" toxic cocktail \" of chemicals that, when combined with uv light, are capable of destroying any living organism, the research reveals. It centers on perchlorate, a chemical compound naturally found on earth, where the temperature keeps it stable, and on mars, where it can wreak havoc. Researchers at the university of edinburgh first exposed a common bacteria found on spacecraft to uv radiation similar to that which occurs on mars'surface. The bacteria died in about a minute, reports zme science. Next, researchers mixed magnesium perchlorate with the bacteria and exposed it to the same level of radiation. This time, the bacteria died in 30 seconds. Intrigued, researchers then added iron oxides and hydrogen peroxide, both of which are found on mars. Under uv light, the components appeared to work with the perchlorate to kill bacteria 11 times faster than just perchlorate did. What does this mean for future mars missions? well, there's little risk that bacteria carried by spacecraft will survive to contaminate mars, researchers say. But life on mars must also lie below the surface, where it's free of \" reactive uv-activated perchlorates, \" a nasa scientist tells the guardian. The study author suggests life may survive at depths of two to three yards. Such depths could be reached by the exomars rover scheduled to arrive in 2020.

The new york times takes a deep dive into the case and mckee's difficult transition back into society. \" technology's changed, \" he says. His iphone8 is a mystery. \" i've still got problems with it, with emails and texts. \" mckee was convicted of murder in 1997. He had been in a brawl that left theodore vance with a fatal gunshot wound. In january, a judge overturned the conviction after it was determined that prosecutors had withheld crucial evidence from the defense — namely, per pix11, that vance's dying words were that a hispanic man shot him. \" i can say now that i am satisfied, but i ' m not happy at all, \" mckee, who is black, said in january. \" they knew it wasn't me. \" now a free man, mckee lives in a one-bedroom apartment near yankee stadium, getting help from relatives as he seeks work. \" i like to be alone a lot these days, \" he tells the times. He takes pleasure in things most people take for granted, such as going out for a cup of coffee. \" i wake up, go for a walk. I can do a lot of things i couldn't do before. I couldn't go and just look at yankee stadium. So i appreciate little things like that. My old life is over. \" ( another wrongfully convicted new york man was recently released from prison. )",

Researchers in finland say the culprit is glycyrrhizin, a tongue-twister of a sweetener that naturally occurs in the licorice plant and is also added to teas and herbal supplements, among other things. Eat it, and your levels of the stress hormone cortisol take a jump, reports the new york times; for pregnant women, that bump could tamper with a fetus's developing nervous system. Licorice is often touted as a remedy for ills as varied as asthma and body odor, but for pregnant women, the potential negative effects outweigh any benefits, lead author katri raikkonen tells the times. \" insofar as you can avoid it during pregnancy, you should do so. \" raikkonen's team reports in the american journal of epidemology that almost half of the 1,049 mothers studied ate licorice before giving birth in 1998. The 11 % who consumed the most — more than 500mg of glycyrrhizin per week, or about 8.8 ounces of pure licorice — had offspring who, by age 13, scored an average of seven points lower on iq tests and had three times the risk of adhd as compared to the lowest exposure group. Daughters tended to reach puberty earlier, which the researchers say is associated with physical and mental disorders. Live science reports that the fda and the who have no warnings against licorice or glycyrrhizin during pregnancy, though finland's national health institute last year added it to its list of foods best skipped while expecting.

According to gps data from his vehicle, the 52-year-old performed a test run on the saturday before the attack, driving over westminster bridge toward parliament as he did on the following wednesday. This shows the attack wasn't carried out on the spur of the moment, though a trained attacker would have carried out the trial run \" on the same day of the week, or at least a weekday, to ensure the security measures and traffic were similar, \" officials tell the wall street journal. Isis claimed masood was a \" soldier, \" though police believe he acted alone, possibly after having become radicalized online. In an attack that killed four people in the space of 82 seconds, masood drove into pedestrians on the bridge before fatally stabbing a police officer. At an inquest thursday, a coroner said he died from a gunshot wound to the chest, the guardian reports. A manager at the hotel where masood stayed the night before the attack tells the bbc that she found it very disturbing that somebody who seemed likable was a \" very dark person who was about to cause a lot of damage to people's lives. \" \" he was very well presented, he was dressed modernly, he was very pleasant to me, \" she says.",

Police in centerville, ohio, received a 911 call about brian halye, 36, and his wife, courtney, 34, thursday morning from one of the children when their parents failed to wake them for school. \" i just woke up and my two parents are on the floor, \" says their 13-year-old son in the call, per wlwt. \" my sister said they're not waking up. They're not breathing. \" brian halye had worked as a pilot for spirit airlines for about nine years, and he last flew on march 10. The airline said in a statement that all its pilots undergo random drug testing. While toxicology results won't be complete for weeks, the coroner's office in montgomery county says the halyes appear to have died from a heroin-fentanyl mixture. \" it is an unfortunate reality in the world we live in right now, \" says an official at the office, noting that the county has seen 165 accidental overdose deaths just since january. Police found paraphernalia at the scene consistent with use of the drugs. Meanwhile, a story in the dayton daily news suggests that courtney halye had battled drug addiction for years. A police report in january 2016 recounts that brian halye removed two guns from her hands; she was taken to the hospital for treatment, and both her husband and mother told police at the time that she had been an addict for years. In a tragic twist, the daily news reports courtney halye's previous husband died of an od in 2007. Two of the children were from that marriage; the other two were from brian halye's earlier marriage. The children, ages 9, 10, 11, and 13, are with relatives. ( earlier this month, another ohio set of parents also overdosed, but in separate locations. )",

        "summary": "\" embarrassing backside exposure \" may soon be a thing of the past — at least when it comes to hospital gowns. \" the current patient gown, with the ties in the back, reinforces a power imbalance between patients and caregivers, \" dr. Mark smith, head of the medstar institute for innovation, tells the new york times, which details a new incarnation of hospital attire created by care+wear. The company, which worked with parsons school of design students, found itself faced with a challenging task: design a comfortable hospital gown that provides more coverage for the patient while still allowing medical staff easy access to insert ivs and check vitals. The result, which retails for $ 45 on the care+wear website, is a cotton-polyester innovation that opens in the front and comes together via a system of snaps and ties that allows different parts of the body to be exposed when needed. Perhaps surprisingly, the hospital gown niche is a relatively untapped market for designers, and it's a big one: cdc stats note 140 million people ended up in the er in 2014, and hospitals need up to five times that number of gowns for an adequate supply, says care+wear ceo chaitenya razdan. The gown's backside box pleat ( image here ) is especially catching people's attention, functioning \" like a giant skirt slit that you can open up to have full access, \" per the company's products chief. The new gown will see an initial test run at one of medstar health's maryland hospitals, expanding to its other nine locations if the gown is a hit.",

The stars of discovery channel's alaskan bush people may not be the \" born and raised wild \" alaskans the show portrays them to be, the alaska dispatch news reports. Six members of the brown family are in trouble with the law for allegedly lying on applications to receive the dividend checks given to alaska residents. The six family members are reported to have lived outside alaska — including in texas and colorado — between 2009 and 2012 while still applying for their dividend checks. All told, they are charged with receiving more than $ 20,000 by lying about their residence, according to fox news. \" they ended up spending a lot more time down south, \" a family lawyer tells the news. \" that doesn't change the fact that these people are the real mccoy. \" a judge rejected a plea deal from the family thursday that would have kept them out of jail in exchange for community service, probation, and restitution, the news reports. He says it's impossible to catch everyone who lies on the dividend forms, so it's important to send a message with punishments. The six brown family members called into the hearing from seattle, for some reason. According to fox, discovery isn't commenting on the future of alaskan bush people, but it has a history of canceling shows when stars get into legal trouble. And the family is reportedly worried about how the charges reflect on their tv personas, the news reports. \" they're kind of tv stars, \" a family lawyer said during the thursday hearing. \" this exposure here is not good. It can't help their show, judge. \"",

            "\"alaskan bush people \" may be bush league. Several of the reality tv family members are accused of stealing a total of $ 20, 938 by lying on applications for alaska's annual oil revenue windfall check. The state gives nearly every year-round resident an annual check for $ 1,884, and four family members are accused of not living in the state from 2009 to 2012, but saying they did. Two of family members tried to plead on wednesday to second-degree unsworn falsification, but the judge rejected their plea and wants them to do jail time. The show's network, discovery, is now faced with the decision whether to cancel the popular series, as it has done with other shows that faced controversy. A discovery rep told fox411 \"no comment \" as to the fate of the show, but if past indicates present it is possible the \"alaskan bush people \" may not stay reality stars for long. Discovery's \"sons of guns \" was given the axe after their star, will hayden, was arrested and charged for raping a minor in august 2014. It's sister network tlc canceled \"19 kids and counting \" after eldest son josh duggar was accused of molesting minors including his sisters, and \"honey boo boo \" was given the pink slip after june shannon aka \"mama june \" publicly dated her daughter anna's child molester, mark mcdaniel. A state court judge on thursday rejected plea agreements for two members of the family associated with the discovery channel's \" alaskan bush people \" reality tv show, putting the case in limbo. Terms of the agreements called for a suspended jail sentence, community service and restitution of $ 7,956 for billy brown and $ 1,174 for joshua brown. But juneau superior court judge philip pallenberg rejected the agreements, saying he thought the sentences should have involved jail time. Attorneys for the men withdrew the pleas following pallenberg's decision. Pallenberg said that when someone steals an alaska permanent fund dividend, it's a theft from every alaskan because everyone else's dividend is a tiny bit smaller. Most alaska residents receive a yearly payout from earnings off the alaska permanent fund, which was born of the state's early oil wealth and has grown through investments. To qualify for the dividend, one must have been a resident of the state for the preceding calendar year. In separate, signed statements accompanying the plea agreements, billy and joshua brown said they left alaska in october 2009"

        "summary": "Donald trump stopped by the tonight show on thursday, and jimmy fallon woke up friday to find himself facing wave after wave of criticism for conducting what the huffington post calls a \" softball interview even by softball standards. \" here's what the media is saying about fallon's performance: the daily dot says fallon fell victim to the new expectation we have of our late-night hosts — thanks to stewart, letterman, and colbert — that they be journalists as well as comedians. Just because fallon is a comedian \" doesn't mean he [ should ] be let off the hook for humanizing a well-documented xenophobic, racist, and misogynistic serial liar, \" the huffington post argues. Newsweek wonders why we expected any better of fallon — \" perhaps the only bigger clown in america than trump \" — when matt lauer essentially couldn't do any better during an actual political event. As a \" powerful white man on tv, \" fallon can afford to treat trump as a joke because to him \" the idea of trump in the white house is as harmless as your face on a pint of ben and jerry's, \" the guardian argues. Slate states that trump is so far removed from a typical candidate from either party that to treat him as one through non-partisan joking \" misses both the moral and the mortal threat of this year's election \" while \" normalizing trump's bigotry, xenophobia, and lies. \" jezebel agrees: \" if there was a time to pander to trump or treat him like an ordinary candidate, it passed several hundred comments about banning muslims and mexicans ago. \" the atlantic observes that fallon seems to have conducted the entire interview simply to get to the would-be viral moment of him touching trump's hair. \" fallon had the opportunity to do something — anything — that could challenge the candidate... He decided to mess up his hair. \"",

        "summary": "Europeans freaking out about horse meat should take heart: it could be worse. Chinese authorities have taken down a crime ring accused of selling meat from a variety of animals — including rats, minks, and foxes — as lamb, in a scheme that raked in around $ 1.6 million, they announced yesterday. Police have arrested 63 people tied to the ring, which has allegedly been operating since 2009, reuters reports. The meat was allegedly covered in gelatin, red pigment, and nitrates before being sold off, the new york times adds. China is no stranger to food scandals, but this one stands out. \" rats? how disgusting. Everything we eat is poison, \" wrote one weibo user. Another quipped, \" how many rats does it take to put together a sheep? \" authorities are taking the problem seriously; this bust was just the latest in a crackdown that since january has seen 904 people arrested for meat-related crimes, and 1,721 factories and shops shut down.",

His betrayal is the lowest form of evil that i could ever imagine. \" in other allen news, cbs recently uploaded a 60 minutes interview with the director from 1992, in which allen said that several weeks before dylan accused him of abuse, mia called him and said, \" i have something very nasty planned for you. \"",

He tried to put a bold face on it, but there's no other way to interpret his remarks to the nation announcing that congressional leaders had cut a deal to raise the debt ceiling. The details of the deal are stark: at least $ 2.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next two years, a two-stage approach to raising the debt ceiling, and a new committee to recommend further cuts to entitlement programs, along with huge automatic spending cuts if congress fails to institute that plan. As described, the deal is a major victory for republicans that will further embolden them over the next 18 months, and may mortally wound obama's chances of reelection. The president told the nation that after ten years the united states would have \" the lowest level of annual domestic spending since dwight eisenhower",
            "And then there are the reported terms of the deal, which amount to an abject surrender on the part of the president. First, there will be big spending cuts, with no increase in revenue. Then a panel will make recommendations for further deficit reduction — and if these recommendations aren't accepted, there will be more spending cuts. Photo republicans will supposedly have an incentive to make concessions the next time around, because defense spending will be among the areas cut. But the g.o.p. Has just demonstrated its willingness to risk financial collapse unless it gets everything its most extreme members want. Why expect it to be more reasonable in the next round? in fact, republicans will surely be emboldened by the way mr. Obama keeps folding in the face of their threats. He surrendered last december, extending all the bush tax cuts; he surrendered in the spring when",
            "It was president obama's bottom line, a position he repeated in every recent public utterance on his debt-ceiling talks with congress: any deal must be \"balanced \" with spending cuts and tax increases. But in his eleventh-hour stare-down with tea party-infused republicans, with a possible government default on the line, obama blinked. The deal to trim the federal deficit by more than $ 2 trillion and increase the government's borrowing limit contains no guarantee that tax increases will be part of the equation. After weeks of presidential demands for sacrifice by corporate jet owners and hedge-fund managers, those taxpayers and others can rest easy — at least for now. Liberals were furious as the terms of the agreement came into focus sunday, and yet another capitulation by obama on economic policy threatened to further dampen enthusiasm among the core democratic voters he will need to win reelection next year.

He tried to put a bold face on it, but there's no other way to interpret his remarks to the nation announcing that congressional leaders had cut a deal to raise the debt ceiling. The details of the deal are stark: at least $ 2.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next two years, a two-stage approach to raising the debt ceiling, and a new committee to recommend further cuts to entitlement programs, along with huge automatic spending cuts if congress fails to institute that plan. As described, the deal is a major victory for republicans that will further embolden them over the next 18 months, and may mortally wound obama's chances of reelection. The president told the nation that after ten years the united states would have \" the lowest level of annual domestic spending since dwight eisenhower",
            "And then there are the reported terms of the deal, which amount to an abject surrender on the part of the president. First, there will be big spending cuts, with no increase in revenue. Then a panel will make recommendations for further deficit reduction — and if these recommendations aren't accepted, there will be more spending cuts. Photo republicans will supposedly have an incentive to make concessions the next time around, because defense spending will be among the areas cut. But the g.o.p. Has just demonstrated its willingness to risk financial collapse unless it gets everything its most extreme members want. Why expect it to be more reasonable in the next round? in fact, republicans will surely be emboldened by the way mr. Obama keeps folding in the face of their threats. He surrendered last december, extending all the bush tax cuts; he surrendered in the spring when",
            "It was president obama's bottom line, a position he repeated in every recent public utterance on his debt-ceiling talks with congress: any deal must be \"balanced \" with spending cuts and tax increases. But in his eleventh-hour stare-down with tea party-infused republicans, with a possible government default on the line, obama blinked. The deal to trim the federal deficit by more than $ 2 trillion and increase the government's borrowing limit contains no guarantee that tax increases will be part of the equation. After weeks of presidential demands for sacrifice by corporate jet owners and hedge-fund managers, those taxpayers and others can rest easy — at least for now. Liberals were furious as the terms of the agreement came into focus sunday, and yet another capitulation by obama on economic policy threatened to further dampen enthusiasm among the core democratic voters he will need to win reelection next year.

The idea came to them after they finished reading the series, but more than a year before the first movie came out. \" it was like i never wanted it to end, \" moore tells the los angeles times. Their 10 installments have racked up 4.5 million views so far and have gained the teens a degree of celebrity. The filmmakers were high school sophomores when they started the project, with a budget of $ 30. Moore's family farm, a nearby park, and cast members ' homes served as sets; costumes were often sourced from goodwill. When the videos started getting popular, moore and two of her friends were invited to a science fiction convention to talk about filmmaking — and watch their mini-movies ( each is about eight minutes long ) on the big screen. So far, the teens haven't seen any money from the videos, but moore has experienced one exciting perk: she was cast as an extra in the first hunger games feature film — and the director recognized her.

The girls, ages 15 and 16, apparently were lured by a \" slick \" online campaign to join militants with the islamic state, an fbi official tells abc news. They made it as far as frankfurt, germany, before being detained, and all three have been returned to their families in denver. It's unclear whether they will face charges. The voice of america first reported the incident, saying that two of the girls are of somali origin, while the third is sudanese. Family members reportedly caught wind of the girls ' plans after they left and informed authorities in denver. The news comes after the arrest in july of 19-year-old shannon maureen conley, also of denver, who pleaded guilty to providing material support to al-qaeda and the group's affiliates. Conley was arrested while trying to board a plane to syria. The fbi official who spoke to abc says he knows of other unpublicized cases of high school kids trying to travel to syria to join isis.",

The adl and the daily beast explain how pepe, which furie initially conceived for his comic strip boy's club, started getting pickup on online sites such as reddit and 4chan and evolved from a harmless meme to a racist, anti-semitic symbol, and then to an unofficial mascot for trump supporters. Now it's not uncommon to see a version of pepe floating down social media feeds donning a hitler mustache, jewish yarmulke, or kkk getup, the adl notes. Meanwhile, furie shrugs off his character's annexation, telling the atlantic he feels \" pretty neutral \" about the whole thing, that it's \" just a phase, \" and that \" people reappropriating things for their own agenda...

Then hillary clinton gave a speech in reno, nevada, in which she denounced mr trump for bringing the alt-right and its admirers into the mainstream of american politics.

        "summary": "Researchers have come up with a way to get kids to chow down on 54 % more fruits and vegetables, and it's remarkably straightforward: just have them go out for recess before lunch rather than afterward. Researchers studied 2,500 elementary-schoolers in utah receiving fruits and veggies at lunch as part of the national school lunch program. Three of seven schools studied moved their recess periods to before lunch, and researchers had the unenviable task of watching the garbage cans to see how much healthy stuff got thrown away. Turns out that the kids ate 54 % more fruits and vegetables when recess was before lunch, time reports. Plus, in schools that made the swap, 45 % more kids ate at least one serving of fruits and veggies. It's not hard to explain the increase when kids are rushing through their lunches to get outside. \" recess is a pretty big deal for most kids. If you have kids ( choose ) between playing and eating their veggies, the time spent playing is going to win most of the time, \" says a study author. There are cost benefits, too: first of all, the change itself costs nothing, cornell university reports. What's more, \" decreasing waste of fruits and vegetables is important for schools and districts that are faced with high costs of offering healthier food choices, \" researchers say. The findings, time notes, might not apply to kids bringing their lunches, who have more time to eat since they're not waiting in line. ( meanwhile, if you find yourself eating less and less meat, you might be a \" reducetarian. \" )",

The 24-year-old's shooting and subsequent death sparked protests monday night, the ap reports; hundreds of people blocked traffic for hours on an interstate, ending with 42 arrests. The incident that led to the shooting started when police were called to the scene of an assault around 12: 45am sunday, and arrived to find clark allegedly interfering with paramedics who were trying to help the victim. As police officers attempted to calm clark, a scuffle ensued, and clark, who was not armed, was shot. Tuesday, minnesota authorities said they have a few partial videos of the incident, but they won't be released publicly during the course of the investigation. Those videos are from sources including an ambulance, a mobile police video station, a public housing camera, surveillance video from a building across the street, and citizens ' cellphone videos. There is no police body camera or dashcam footage, and none of the videos show the incident in full, the minneapolis star tribune reports.

David edward abbott, 39, of gainesville, virginia, killed himself tuesday morning moments before police could serve him with search and arrest warrants. Abbott was a manassas city detective. He had served on the northern virginia-washington, d.c. Internet crimes against children task force and was involved in high profile sex crime cases.

In december, when so much of the media coverage portrayed the lame-duck democratic congress and president obama as being incredibly productive, popular job approval of that institution plummeted to an historic low 13 %.

Ailes had spent the better part of the weekend at his putnam county estate thinking about how to stage-manage beck's departure from fox, which at that point was all but inevitable. But, as with everything concerning glenn beck, the situation was a mess, simultaneously a negotiation and a therapy session. Beck had already indicated he was willing to walk away — \"i don't want to do cable news anymore, \" he had told ailes. But moving him out the door without collateral damage was proving difficult. Ailes had hired beck in october 2008 to reenergize fox's audience after obama's election, and he'd succeeded beyond anyone's wildest hopes, tapping deep wells of resentment and igniting them into a vast, national conflagration. The problem was that it had almost engulfed fox itself. Beck was huge and uncontrollable, and some of fox's other big names seemed diminished by comparison — and were speaking up about it. Beck seemed to many to be fox news's id made visible, saying things — obama is a racist, nazi tactics are progressive tactics — dredged from the right-wing subconscious. These were things that weren't supposed to be said, even at fox, and they were consuming the brand. Ailes had built his career by artfully tending the emotional undercurrents of both politics and entertainment, using them to power ratings and political careers; now they were out of his control. \"let's make a deal, \" ailes told beck flatly. During a 45-minute conversation, the two men agreed on the terms: beck would give up his daily 5 p.m. Program and appear in occasional network \"specials \" — but even that didn't solve their problem. Tensions flared over how many specials he would appear in. Fox wanted six, beck's advisers wanted four. At another meeting, beck choked up; he and ailes had always had a bond. And when ailes thought beck's advisers were jerking him around, he threatened to blow up the talks. \"i '",

            "( cnn ) president donald trump publicly undermined his attorney rudy giuliani on friday, saying the former new york city mayor had only a loose grasp of the stormy daniels business when he spoke about it earlier this week. A clarifying statement from giuliani issued four hours later did little to illuminate the matter. Instead, the series of pronouncements only lent further confusion to an issue that has deeply undercut the administration's credibility and has fueled the impression of a west wing in crisis. \" he \" ll get his facts straight, \" trump stipulated of his longtime friend on friday morning, before adding: \" there has been a lot of misinformation. I say, you know what? learn before you speak. It's a lot easier. \" calling giuliani a \" great guy, \" trump nonetheless insisted his attorney wasn't fully up to speed when he told an interviewer that trump had reimbursed another lawyer for hush money paid to daniels, an adult film actress who claims she had sex with trump in 2006.

Instead, the military wife and mom from fort drum, ny, was handed almost unimaginable news following her march 3 emergency c-section: a diagnosis of stage 3 choriocarcinoma, an incredibly rare cancer tied to pregnancy. The 26-year-old has since been put in a medically induced coma, reports abc news, with tumors having spread to her lungs. As dr. David landsberg of crouse hospital explains, \" placental tissue grows at a very rapid rate to support the fetus, which explains why the cancer is so aggressively metastatic. It grows into the uterus and once it gets out, it's looking for somewhere else to grow. \" at most, seven pregnancies out of every 100,000 are thought to be affected by choriocarcinoma; making hinman's situation all the more rare: doctors say her condition would be \" 100 % fatal \" without the use of ecmo, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which the post-standard calls an \" unprecedented and unorthodox \" treatment plan. The technology employs a pump that circulates blood through an artificial lung and then back into the body. Says landsberg, \" the ecmo is keeping her alive for the chemo to do its job... But the danger to the patient is just from being on ecmo. \" hinman's girls, who were born at 30 weeks and named kinleigh ann hinman ( 2 pounds, 9 ounces ) and azlynn mary hinman ( 3 pounds, 6 ounces ), are doing well.

        "summary": "President trump's decision to strip former cia chief — and frequent trump critic — john brennan of his security clearance apparently isn't sitting well in the intelligence community. A dozen former top senior officials, including former cia chiefs, have signed a letter condemning the move, reports cbs news. \" [ w ] e all agree that the president's action has nothing to do with who should and should not hold security clearances — and everything to do with an attempt to stifle free speech, \" reads the letter. Signees include william webster, george tenet, and gen. David petraeus. A more critical reply to the president's move comes from retired navy admiral william mcraven, who oversaw the raid that killed osama bin laden. In an open letter to trump in the washington post, mcraven calls brennan \" a man of unparalleled integrity \" whose loyalty to the us is clear. \" therefore, i would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so i can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency, \" writes mcraven. Trump, meanwhile, issued a series of tweets about the decision thursday night, including: \" @tuckercarlson speaking of john brennan: ' how did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be cia director in the first place? ' now that is a really good question! \" an assessment at axios suggests that trump likes making these kinds of moves because he can do so under his own authority: it's \" pure power and instant gratification, \" write mike allen and jonathan swan.

In stark contrast to earlier research that found beards could be as dirty as toilets, researchers who swabbed the faces of 409 male hospital workers found clean-shaven men were three times more likely to carry bacteria on their faces compared to men with beards. And that's not all. \" the clean-shaven men actually had higher rates of certain bacterial species \" and were 10 % more likely to carry antibiotic resistant bacteria mrsa on their faces, study author carrie kovarik explains in a release. Though penn medicine researchers didn't examine why this was the case, kovarik says shaving causes tiny cuts on the skin where bacteria can fester. \" in general, we have no need to fear the beard, \" she says. In a second study, researchers took a closer look at the beards of surgeons, which are \" controversial because of their potential to retain and transmit pathogenic organisms. \" after 10 surgeons with full beards and 10 without shook their faces over a petri dish, researchers concluded \" the bearded group did not shed more than the clean-shaven group while unmasked, masked, or hooded. \" \" it's not unthinkable that the cleanliness of my own beard may pale in comparison to the immaculate whorls of a surgeon's tress or nurse's sterile chops, \" joshua a. Krisch writes at vocativ. \" but, at the very least, these studies suggest that all facial hair deserves to be judged on a case by case basis. \" more good news for men with beards: facial hair keeps sweat close to the face for a nice cooling effect in summer, per gq.

Lead surgeon andre van der merwe confirmed the news about the unidentified 21-year-old to south africa's news24. Even more remarkable: the girlfriend is about four months along, meaning she became pregnant around two months after the december surgery. \" this is what we intended, that he should be able to stand up and be able to urinate, and have intercourse, so it is a milestone for him, \" the surgeon tells the bbc. But it's way ahead of schedule: van der merwe originally cautioned that it could take about two years for the man's penis to be fully functional; that's the amount of time it takes a man who has had his penis severed and then reattached to regain all function. He adds that a paternity test wasn't requested by his team because there's no reason to doubt the couple. Van der merwe also points out that the issue was with his penis, not testicles, so his \" sperm wasn't affected. \" the patient lost his penis in circumcision-gone-wrong when he was 18; the bbc notes less than half-an-inch of his original penis was left after that procedure. Van der merwe tells the afp that there are \" about nine people \" waiting to undergo the operation, but they need to first secure a donor penis.

        "summary": "President trump tweeted wednesday that he's shutting down both his manufacturing council and strategic and policy forum \" rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople \" involved. However, bloomberg reports the strategic and policy forum had already decided to disband wednesday in the wake of trump's comments on neo-nazis, white supremacists, and charlottesville. According to cnbc, the strategic and policy forum was a business advisory council featuring the heads of jpmorgan chase, blackstone, walmart, blackrock, ibm, and more. Meanwhile, trump's manufacturing council has been bleeding members since monday. The ceo of campbell's soup on wednesday joined the half-dozen other ceos who've left the council, usa today reports. Here's what else you need to know: nbc philadelphia has more on denise morrison, the campbell's soup ceo who became the last person to leave trump's manufacturing council before it was disbanded. \" racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and are not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in charlottesville. I believe the president should have been — and still needs to be — unambiguous on that point, \" morrison said in a statement. New york times reporter landon thomas jr. Tweets that nine of 12 ceos on the strategic and policy forum agreed to resign if it wasn't disbanded during a conference call prior to trump's tweet wednesday. A day earlier, advocacy groups had delivered 400,000 signatures to the ceos of blackstone and jpmorgan asking them to leave the strategic and policy forum, cnn reports. After trump disbanded that council, jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon sent a memo to employees saying he \" strongly \" disagreed with trump on charlottesville. \"racism, intolerance, and violence are always wrong \" the wall street journal quotes dimon as saying in the memo. \"there is no room for equivocation here. \" the daily beast states that while the disbanded councils were mostly symbolic, \" their respective ends represent a massive embarrassment for a president who has long claimed to be a friend and champion of business. \" trump's crumbling relationship with business leaders could also make future tax reform efforts more difficult. Finally, trump's disbanding of his business councils didn't appear to hurt the stock market any, with barron's reporting the dow gained 30 points amid the president's announcement.",

Now, the fda is warning that the misuse of imodium — generically known as loperamide — could cause serious, possibly fatal heart problems. Thanks to america's increasing addiction to opioids, the problem is getting worse. In the 39 years since loperamide was approved, the fda got reports of 48 cases of serious heart problems — 10 of them fatal — connected to the drug. More than half of those 48 cases came after 2010, and there are likely others that have gone unreported. Most of the problems have occurred in people who are intentionally abusing loperamide. The wall street journal quotes a doctor who says loperamide is \" extremely dangerous in high doses. \" it can cause \" abnormally fast heart-rhythm disturbances, \" cardiac arrest, and fainting. Researchers want more regulation of loperamide sales, nbc news reports.

They each spent 21 years in prison based on those lies, reports the intercept. But after 25 years, their names have finally been cleared. Texas couple fran and dan keller were exonerated of the sexual assault of a child tuesday after travis county district attorney margaret moore filed a motion to dismiss their cases. While noting that some accusers don't agree with her decision, moore said \" no credible evidence exists that inculpates the defendants, \" who are \" actually innocent \" of the crime for which they were each sentenced to 48 years in 1992, per the austin chronicle. The case began when a 3-year-old girl who visited their daycare said she'd been spanked by dan, now 75. Questioned by her mother and a therapist, the girl went on to tell of rape and orgies. After more children came forward with increasingly outrageous claims, the kellers were convicted based in part on an er doctor's opinion that the girl suffered a vaginal injury that had possibly resulted from sexual abuse. They were only released from prison in 2013 after the doctor testified he'd made a mistake, having learned at a medical conference that genitalia with that appearance is normal. He says he tried to share his error with the austin pd years prior but was dismissed; lawyer keith hampton worked on the case pro bono for six years to bring about the exoneration, which makes the kellers each eligible to receive $ 1.7 million from the state.

Amongst the depositions is that of new york cardinal timothy dolan, a former archbishop of milwaukee, the journal sentinel reports. The documents were released as part of the archdiocese's bankruptcy, in a deal with victims suing for fraud, the ap reports. The victims say the archdiocese defrauded them by knowingly transferring abusive priests around parishes and schools to cover up their crimes. Among the personnel files released are those of the late father lawrence murphy, alleged to have molested as many as 200 deaf boys, and sigfried widera, who was accused of 42 counts of child abuse before committing suicide in 2003, the journal sentinel reports. Dolan is not accused of moving problem priests around, but he did oversee payments made to abusive priests when they left the church, some as high as $ 20,000, the ap reports.",

Rick santorum complained tuesday -- back before he won both alabama and mississippi and his mood brightened -- that fox news was in the bag for his rival mitt romney. That charge doesn't really make much sense at all: not only have many fox personalities praised santorum and bashed romney, it's the former massachusetts governor who seems to have trouble whenever he goes on the channel. Back in november, there was his very testy interview with bret baier. And an appearance on megyn kelly's america live wednesday continues the trend. Romney finds himself in a frustrating situation: his campaign is clearly more disciplined, better organized, and better funded than his rivals ', and it's almost mathematically certain at this point that he ' ll win the nomination. But he can't convince gop voters to unite around him, and it seems like his annoyance is starting to show in the interview. Kelly came out with some tough questions, and played a clip of him talking about why he thought a federal mandate for health insurance was a good idea. ( he instituted such a mandate in massachusetts and used to support it nationally, but now says he thinks mandates are not an appropriate federal solution."

Their goal: make pot-infused products clearly labeled for the general public. They agreed that it's easy for some products, like candies and pot cookies, but what about meats, liquids, and powdered drink mixes? \" this is a very, very heavy lift, \" said a critic of the marijuana industry. The regulators also plan to standardize serving sizes so that each bite contains only about 10mg of thc, pot's psychoactive ingredient, and make sure marijuana drinks come in child-resistant containers, the denver post reports. Like colorado, washington state has already limited how many ounces of pot a customer can buy per purchase — but with marijuana so much stronger than in decades past, a newcomer might still down a few edibles and ingest enough thc \" to knock over an elephant, \" an expert tells the international business times. And without the fda's help, how can states ensure that thc is evenly distributed in a batch of cookies or brownies? a report that generally lauds colorado's transition to legalized pot highlights other problems — like the fact that some buyers will eat too much of certain pot edibles, not realizing they take 30-60 minutes to kick in, io9 reports. \" there's a strong need for any consumer to be well informed, \" says a pot expert. \" that does not mean judged, shamed, blamed or glorified; it just means we owe it to consumers of marijuana to give them accurate, accessible information. \" ( read about maureen dowd's shocking experience with pot-edibles. )",

Our top priority is supporting the drivers who use uber during this difficult time. We will continue to work with the government in the hope that they will update their proposed regulations and again enable danes to enjoy the benefits of modern technologies like uber. \" however, the company added that it is not leaving denmark altogether. \" we have a team of 40 talented engineers based in aarhus who help develop uber technology for users around the world.

        "summary": "The future of comedy could depend on how much of a sense of humor british judges have when dealing with an unusual defamation lawsuit, legal experts say. Comedian louise beaumont says her estranged husband is suing her for mentioning him in her stand-up show at the edinburgh fringe festival last year, the guardian reports. She says he is accusing her of defamation and breach of privacy and is demanding around $ 42,000 plus legal costs — despite the fact that she removed all mention of him from her \" hard mode \" show after she received a complaint from him last year. The 50-minute show's main focus was on censorship and free speech, chortle reports. Beaumont says she mentioned her husband to tell the audience \" how sad i was that my marriage had broken down recently. \" \" he has a lot more money than me and he says that i accused him of abusing me in my show. And so he's suing me, which in my opinion is simply an attempt to silence me, \" beaumont writes in a gofundme appeal. \" as stand-up comedians, i believe it's the very definition of our job to talk about our lives and social issues. So this has become a free speech issue — and free speech means everything to me. \" libel lawyer mark stephens says this will be the first case of its kind to go before a judge since juries were abolished in defamation cases in 2013. \" it's going to be a test of whether the british judiciary understands a joke — i mean that seriously, \" he tells the guardian. He says juries had a long history of throwing \" libel cases which were based on humor out on their ear. \" ( this one-liner was deemed the funniest at last year's fringe festival. )",

But over the past year in san francisco, only 23 people did so. \" so instead of waiting for the community to take action, we're taking action for the community, \" san francisco district attorney george gascón said wednesday. The city will be dismissing and sealing over 3,000 misdemeanor convictions and reviewing and possibly re-sentencing nearly 5,000 felony convictions dating back to 1975. By doing this, gascón said san francisco can keep people from losing out on jobs or housing because of past activity that is now legal. \" while drug policy on the federal level is going backwards, san francisco is once again taking the lead to undo the damage that this country's disastrous, failed drug war has had on our nation and on communities of color in particular, \" gascón said. A study found african americans are four times as likely as whites to be arrested for marijuana possession in san francisco, the san francisco chronicle reports. The president of the san francisco chapter of the naacp calls gascón's announcement \" a step toward setting black people free to live in the community, to have jobs, to have health care, to have a decent education. \" according to the ap, the drug policy alliance estimates that statewide only 5 % of people eligible to have their marijuana convictions reduced, dismissed, or expunged have filed a petition, which can be expensive and confusing.",

The company plans to close 175 of its stores in north america over the next few years, most of them by the end of january. That's around a quarter of its stores, not counting outlet stores, and analysts say it's part of a trend for major brands to reduce mall locations. \" your biggest competitor used to be your neighbor in the mall, \" a retail analyst at nomura tells usa today, but \" right now your biggest competitor is the infinite number of random start-up websites. You just don't need as many [ brick-and-mortar ] locations. \" gap also plans to axe around 250 corporate jobs. An analyst at merchant forecast tells usa today that while \" increasing the scarcity \" of gap stores may help, there's no \" major creative design force behind the collection \" since danish creative director rebekka bay was fired in january and the position was eliminated. Ceo art peck agrees that design failures have been a major issue. He tells the new york times that the problems include \" a lack of femininity, \" as well as \" a lack of optimism in the brand, which shows up as a very tight and muted color palette, and a lack of print and pattern. \" gap recently raised the minimum wage for all its workers, including those at old navy and banana republic stores, which will not be affected by the closures.",

        "summary": "Researchers have found an unusual way in which whales and humans are similar: we both get suntans. Blue whales, especially, tend to tan to protect themselves from the sun's uv rays, reports the canadian press. Essentially, they tan during their summer migrations to ward off dangerous sunburns, as a newcastle university researcher explains to the bbc: \" when blue whales go on their holidays to the gulf of california they get a tan the same way we do. And that tan protects blue whales from sunburnt dna. \" the big blues have lighter skins than the other two types studied — sperm whales and fin whales — and that makes the tanning necessary. Sperm whales, which spend up to six hours at the surface and thus take in big doses of uv rays, take a different human-like tack. Their bodies activate what amount to repair genes, explains national geographic. \" this process is similar to how human bodies produce antioxidants in response to free radicals, molecules that can cause a lot of genetic and cellular damage. \" the fin whales, meanwhile, have the darkest skin of the three and fared the best in terms of sun damage thanks to their naturally high levels of melanin. ( the fins don't migrate, staying in the gulf of california year-round, notes new scientist. ) researchers say the findings might not only help them better protect whales and other marine animals from cancer, but they could shed light on skin cancer in humans and the aging process in general. ( in other sea-creature news, researchers say the big dolphin die-off on the east coast is the result of a virus. )",

Jake lloyd — best known for portraying a young anakin skywalker in 1999's star wars: episode i - the phantom menace — was reported to police on wednesday afternoon for driving recklessly in colleton county, and allegedly took off when deputies pursued him onto i-95. \" he starts passing cars on the double yellow line, \" sgt. Kyle strickland tells nbc news. \" he's going head on into oncoming traffic. \" the 26-year-old reportedly hit speeds of 100 miles per hour and crashed through a fence. When he reached a wooded area, lloyd used the force, so to speak, and was not deterred by the trees. \" he bounced off a bunch of them like a pinball machine, \" strickland says. Lloyd eventually stopped, however, and gave police the surname \" broadbent. \" a former agent confirmed that the man was in fact lloyd, according to an ap report. Strickland noted the former child actor \" didn't appear to be on drugs or intoxicated \" at the time of arrest but gave no insight into why he may have decided to run from the law. Lloyd was booked for driving without a license, reckless driving, failing to stop for officers, and resisting arrest, and was still in jail as of last night. His last film was the 2005 drama madison, according to imdb.",

Plus he wants to give a potential president hillary clinton a supportive senate for her legislative agenda, cabinet choices, and more. Franken is currently using his fame to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for democratic senate candidates around the country. Politico reports the democrats need to win back five seats in 2016 to retake control of the senate, which they lost last year. And it sounds like they're ready to let franken help them do it. \"he's become a serious senator, \" sen. Chuck schumer tells politico. \" but he still has that celebrity aura.

It began when two hijackers commandeered an aircraft carrying 118 people in the skies over libya and diverted it to the mediterranean island, reports reuters. Claiming to have a hand grenade, the hijackers threatened to blow up the afriqiyah airways a320, which had been en route from one libyan airport to another. After a few hours of negotiations once the plane landed, the hijackers freed everybody on board, then turned themselves over to troops, reports the times of malta. Their motives remain unclear, but they appear to revolve around the late libyan dictator moammar gadhafi. The hijackers said they belonged to a group called al fatah al gadida, which is loyal to gadhafi, and they had promised to release all passengers if their demands were met. Those demands haven't been made public, though one unconfirmed report says they called for the release of gadhafi's son saif, per morroco world news. The times reports it's the first significant hijacking involving the country since 1985. On nov. 23 of that year, an egyptair boeing 737 plane was forced to land on the island. A 1986 people article about a survivor of the deadly incident reported 57 of the 92 passengers died during the rescue effort.",

The record rise — which, contrary to some predictions, even the recession couldn't curb — means that hopes of keeping global warming to a safe level is nearly out of reach, the guardian reports in an exclusive. The paper had previously reported that in order to prevent potentially \"dangerous climate change, \" we must keep the global average temperature from rising more than 2 degrees celsius. But the iea's chief economist now says that idea is just \"a nice utopia. \" the iea estimates that 30.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide entered the atmosphere last year, most of it from burning fossil fuel. That's a rise of 1.6 gigatonnes over 2009's figure. \" i am very worried. This is the worst news on emissions, \" says the economist for the iea, which has calculated that annual emissions must remain below 32 gigatonnes annually through 2020 if we're to escape global warming's worst effects. Another expert warns that if the pattern continues, there will be \"a 50 % chance of a rise in global average temperature of more than 4c by 2100, \" which would lead to \"widespread mass migration and conflict. \" click to see the latest power duo to fight climate change.",
