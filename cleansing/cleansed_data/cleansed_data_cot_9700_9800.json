He was even more surprised when the media picked up on the cable and reported it as gospel truth. ( see the guardian, whose report in turn got widely disseminated. ) the problem is that the documentary — a damning assessment of the american health care system — was not banned in cuba, he writes at the huffington post. Not only had the film been playing in cuban theaters before the state department cable of jan. 31, 2008, it was shown on national television there in april of that year, writes moore, who references news articles of the time to prove his point. So why would a us official write such a bogus cable? mainly, the bushies in power at the time didn't like him and wanted to discredit his movie, which had just been nominated for an oscar, writes moore. \" it is a stunning look at the orwellian nature of how bureaucrats for the state spin their lies and try to recreate reality ( i assume to placate their bosses and tell them what they want to hear ). \" click here for the full column.",

As the cdc pushes back against the post's story, experts have a lot to say on the matter. 1984?: \"it's absurd and orwellian, it's stupid and orwellian, \" a former federal official told the ny times. \" but they are not saying to not use the words in reports or articles or scientific publications or anything else the cdc does. \" alongside a photo of orwell's classic dystopian novel, senator jeff merkley‏ concurred with that sentiment on twitter: \"banned words in trump's america apparently include \"evidence-based, \" \"transgender, \" and \"vulnerable. \" are you kidding me?!?! \" republican strategist and political commentator ana navarro used all seven words in a tweet criticizing the news in a nod to late comic george carlin's seven dirty words joke. Michael halpern, deputy director of the center for science and democracy, told the times that the cdc must assure americans it can operate outside partisan politics: \"the fact that the agency began controlling what scientists can say to reporters a few months ago doesn't suggest they want to be open and honest with the public. \" per the ap, dean of bu's school of public health dr. Sandro galea asserts that not using these words deprioritizes certain issues: \"if you are saying you cannot use words like'transgender ' and'diversity, ' it's a clear statement that you cannot pay attention to these issues. \" hhs called the post's story \" a complete mischaracterization \" in a statement, reports abc news. \" hhs will continue to use the best scientific evidence available to improve the health of all americans, \" it read. Cdc director dr brenda fitzgerald took to twitter to double down on the message: \" i want to assure you there are no banned words at cdc.

The guardian reports scientists had already figured out that piebald animals get their distinctive white patches because of a mutated gene. But they were way off in their theory of how that mutation produced white bellies and heads. According to the telegraph, the long-running theory was that the mutation caused pigment cells to move too slowly to completely cover the developing animal. But new research shows the genetic mutation actually causes pigment cells to move faster. The problem is that it also causes them to divide slowly, meaning there aren't enough of them to cover the whole animal. This leads to the second busted hypothesis about piebald animals. Gizmodo reports scientists assumed something in the dna was controlling pigment cells and telling them where to go. In reality, \" the pigment just goes wherever. \" \"there's a randomness in the way the cells behave, which means that the white patch you get is never the same, even in genetically identical individuals, \" researcher ian jackson tells the telegraph. Jackson's study was published wednesday in nature communications. While it's fun to know tuxedo cats'tuxedos are like snowflakes, the study actually has a practical application. According to the guardian, a mathematical model developed by researchers could help scientists understand a related genetic mutation that can cause everything from deafness to cancer in humans.

Latham said it was unclear when banana-sam would return to his exhibit with his 17 squirrel monkey friends. \" we hope very, very soon, \" he said. \" i ' m sure people will want to come and see him. \" banana-sam gained worldwide fame as his abduction spread around the globe. A twitter account that someone opened in his name, @sf_bananasam, had more than 2,000 followers, with posts detailing his alleged exploits throughout the city. A trip to the monkey bars in golden gate park was apparently disappointing. \" i was never cut out for life on the outside, \" read one post following his return. \" 3 hots and a cot for me! \" on sunday, police",

( associated press ) banana sam was \" hungry, trembling and thirsty, \" after police returned him to the zoo, but a full physical examination showed he was healthy, zoo spokesman danny latham said in a statement. Banana sam's theft thursday prompted the zoo to boost security and keep the other 17 squirrel monkeys indoors. He was taken after thieves cut through a gate and made holes in the mesh surrounding the monkey exhibit. The 17-year-old monkey was found at stern grove, a park about a mile ( 1.6 kilometers ) from the zoo, police spokesman carlos manfredi said. The monkey was found by a bystander who saw him come out of the bushes. \" he managed to coax the monkey into his backpack, \" manfredi said. The man called police, and within an hour they met with zoo officials, who verified the monkey"

At least that's the general consensus about the high-tech, bulky utensil that vibrates and flashes when you eat too fast, the los angeles times reports. The weight-loss gadget is being criticized for \" fat shaming \" the hungry by tracking each \" fork serving, \" the time between each bite, how many taken per meal, and how much time spent eating. If you eat too fast, you get a nice little shock, or \" gentle vibrations, \" as per the company website. The kickstarter-funded device — which is a bit pricier than your average fork at $ 99 — stores the data and tracks eating habits by plugging it into an app. There's a positive motivation behind the hapifork — slower eating leads to weight loss, improves digestion, and keeps heartburn at bay; the company suggests 60 to 75 bites per 20- to 30-minute meal, explains new york writer jessica roy. She turned herself into a guinea pig for a week and after eating several guilt-ridden meals with the hapifork, pointed out a few of its flaws: complicated software, the inconvenience of disassembling and cleaning it after every meal, and inaccurate measurements. \" still, \" she writes, \" after using it for a week, the hapifork strikes me as one step too far in a quest for the quantified self: there are some things, it turns out, i just don't need quantified. \" ( for more weight-loss trends, check out this one about eating ice. )",

He concluded his comments, which lasted about four minutes, by urging officers to stay focused on fighting crime. \" we had a 9-year-old kid shot yesterday by these knuckleheads, gangsters, thugs, whatever you want to call them, \" he said. \" we have innocent people getting shot on the streets of baltimore. \" people think we're down. People are giving up on us, \" batts said. \" i mean this with all my heart",
            "Savannah, ga ( may 26, 2015 ): emergency communications officers at the savannah-chatham county 911 center were surprised and a little bit gratified friday when they received a hand-written, hand-delivered note from a sixth-grade student apologizing for a prank call. In it, the youth apologized for the prank after he gave in to a dare from friends. His parents were not amused and ordered him to write the apology and then drove him to the 911 center to read it aloud to the on-duty shift. The 911 staff was impressed enough to accept his apology and to take him and his parents on a tour of the facility to turn the trip into a positive experience. His parents still have him on \"lockdown \" for the prank. \"i know this was stupid but i was not listening to myself, but i knew it was wrong, \" he wrote, adding, \"please forgive me"

The violence unfolded as muslim militants aligned with the islamic state group fended off government forces for a 10th day in the southern city of marawi. That unrest had sparked fears that the militants might attack elsewhere to divert the focus of thousands of troops trying to quell the siege. In friday's attack, the gunman stole gambling chips, shot tv screens and set gambling tables ablaze by pouring gasoline on them at resorts world manila, dela rosa said. But he said the assailant did not fire at people he encountered. The national police chief described him as \" white, with a mustache \" and about 6 feet tall.

A rare solar eclipse/supermoon/vernal equinox combo will be taking place, with prime eclipse viewing spots in europe, much of northern africa, western asia, and parts of the mideast and newfoundland, reports the guardian — which notes that \" some christian ministers have viewed the rare collision of three celestial events as the beginning of the end of the world. \" some of the other legends and superstitions regarding the event: mythology from a variety of cultures promoted the idea that an eclipse meant dinnertime for malevolently ravenous creatures. In china, a dragon was believed to eat the sun, while hindu legend has the sun eaten by the floating head of the demon rahu, the christian science monitor notes. Other sun-eating predators: korea's \" fire dogs, \" vietnam's space frogs, and the vikings'sky wolves, per national geographic. It's also apparently time to beware of everyday dangers: a long-standing superstition is that pregnant women are especially at risk during an eclipse and that harm may come to their unborn children, the bbc has noted. In india, meanwhile, some folks fast because they believe food prepared during an eclipse is poisoned, per the guardian. There's some good news amid all this terror: the spring equinox — which brings longer and longer days in the northern hemisphere — is typically looked at as a \" time of beginning and renewal, \" the independent notes. And in italy, the most vibrant flowers are said to be those planted during an eclipse, per the guardian.

It's not certain who the cult worshiped, but based on the \" letters of ugarit \" ( a site located in what is now syria ), experts figure it was probably the canaanite storm god known as baal.

Cassation court judges emerged from an emergency meeting saying they would not resume work until morsi takes back his decree completely. The country's supreme constitutional court, however, is still in session, and intends to rule on the legality of egypt's parliament and constitutional congress on sunday. Morsi says he issued the decree to protect those bodies. The move comes amidst protests that raged for a sixth day today. Hundreds of people were in tahrir square this morning, and vowed to stay there until morsi backed down, reuters reports. Police fired tear gas into the square, and there were sporadic clashes on neighboring streets, the telegraph reports. Some masked protesters were seen grabbing the tear gas canisters and hurled them back at police. Yesterday's demonstration saw more than 100,000 in the streets, the guardian reports.",

For one thing, about half is supposed to come from stalker michael david barrett, whose lawyer has said he has lost his life savings over the scandal. It's not even clear he's held a job since his release from prison in 2012, meaning andrews will get little, if anything, from barrett, reports sports illustrated. As for the other half, expect the two companies that own the nashville marriott to appeal, but the safer bet is that they ' ll reach a settlement before going to trial, reports tmz. The site predicts that settlement would be in the $ 20 million range, and while that's still a huge sum, lawyers and other legal costs would consume about $ 9 million of it. And the kicker, via tmz: the remaining $ 11 million is taxable because the award involves emotional distress as opposed to physical injuries. That would bring the original $ 55 million payday to andrews down closer to $ 6 million. ( click for 7 revealing things unveiled during the andrews trial. )",

        "summary": "People in high-income areas tend to live longer than those in low-income areas. While that's not so surprising, the resulting difference in lifespans within the us might be: in some counties, people live to about age 87, while in others the figure is only 67, according to a study published in the journal jama internal medicine. What's more, the study's authors say this gap is only increasing. Here's a look at the coverage: see an interactive map of the health data here. The county with the shortest life expectancy is oglala lakota county in south dakota at 66.8 years, while the longest is summit county in colorado at 86.8 years. Newsweek breaks out the best and worst. More generally, eight of the 10 counties where life expectancy has dropped the most since 1980 are in kentucky, with the other two in oklahoma and alabama, per the washington post. Appalachia, the mississippi delta, and areas with native american populations in the dakotas ( such as oglala lakota ) were especially hard hit. On the flip side, remote areas in alaska's aleutians islands showed the biggest improvement — from 70.7 years in 1980 to 83.7 in 2014 — while manhattan ( new york county ) and brooklyn ( kings county ), and san francisco also fared well. So what's going on? researchers say 75 % of the gap is explained by factors such as smoking, obesity, hypertension, and health care, combined with broader ones such as race and economics, reports fivethirtyeight. All of which means \" there are many interconnecting levers to pull in shaping health policy, \" per axios. Or as the study authors put it: \" policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend. \" between 1980 and 2014, the gap increased by about two years, reports npr, which quotes a worried researcher: \" with every passing year, inequality — however you measure it — has been widening over the last 34 years. \" he expects the trend to continue next year, which is \" probably the most alarming part of the analysis. \" another way of looking at it, per npr: \" the discrepancy is equivalent to the difference between the low-income parts of the developing world and countries with high incomes. \" the good news: overall, the life expectancy at birth for americans rose 5.3 years to an average of 79.1 from 1980 to 2014, per fortune. A blogger at forbes thinks the paper overlooks one big factor: migration. It accounts for where people die, not where they were born or grew up.",

            "A debt-collection company in buffalo used lies and trickery to fraudulently collect more than $ 31 million from thousands of people across the country, the u.s. Attorney's office in manhattan said tuesday in announcing guilty pleas by four participants and charges against 11 others. U.s. Attorney preet bharara said in a statement that the millions of dollars involved could make it the largest fraudulent debt-collection scheme ever prosecuted. The collectors, he said, took \"ruthless advantage of the desperate situation in which the victims found themselves \" by threatening them with arrest and coercing some into paying more than they owed. Court papers describe orchestrated lies. Victims were told, for example, that they had committed a felony by failing to pay debts, that their driver's licenses would be suspended and they would be referred to an \"attorney network. \" one collector told the mother of a debtor undergoing dialysis that he was a \"legal investigator \" with a law firm, not a collection agency, and that he was calling about check fraud, according to court papers. In a third example, a collector told victims that they had committed fraud and that he was \"in contact with the magistrate. … \" \"they are en route right now, \" he reportedly continued. \"within 46 minutes, they will be there to serve you. \" prosecutors say that company owners travell",

The report follows on the release of a 62-page memo released earlier this month in which cosby acknowledged obtaining drugs for the purpose of slipping to women; the times obtained the full 1,000-page deposition, which had apparently never been sealed. Excerpts: cosby told questioners he was a \" pretty decent reader of people and their emotions in these romantic sexual things, whatever you want to call them. \" the times frames it much differently, saying that cosby \" presented himself in the deposition as an unapologetic, cavalier playboy, someone who used a combination of fame, apparent concern and powerful sedatives in a calculated pursuit of young women. \" cosby admitted to funneling money, often in the form of educational assistance, to some of his conquests in an effort to keep his wife in the dark. Asked what he thought of constand crying while testifying, cosby replied, \" i think andrea is a liar and i know she's a liar because i was there. \" confronted with constand's upset mother, he testified that he wanted her to \" tell your mother about the orgasm, \" as proof the encounter was consensual. When asked whether one woman he had sex with in 1976 after giving her quaaludes was capable of consent, he responded, \" i don't know. \" when the plaintiff's lawyer accused cosby of \" making light of a very serious situation, \" he replied \" that very well may be. \" his catchphrase when ending one relationship to begin another: \" moving on. \" the times ' whole report is here; etonline notes the deposition details cosby's own drug and alcohol use.",

The company tells the ap it ' ll list ingredients for its other brands, like michelob, beck's, and busch, \" in the coming days, \" and that it's invited hari to its st. Louis brewery. Millercoors has listed the contents of its top eight beers, including coors light and miller lite. All are listed as having water, barley malt, corn, yeast, and hops, except for blue moon, which swaps in wheat and oats for corn, and also has orange peel and coriander.

Gianforte had 51 % of the vote when the race was called for him, with democratic folk singer rob quist at 44 % and libertarian candidate mark wicks at 6 %, politico reports. At his victory party thursday night, gianforte apologized to the reporter he allegedly grabbed and slammed to the ground, the ap reports. \" i should not have responded the way i did and for that i am sorry, \" he said. Quist, a first-time candidate, was attempting to become the first democrat elected to the seat since 1997. After the incident with guardian reporter ben jacobs, which was witnessed by a fox news crew, democrats called for gianforte to withdraw from the race, the state's leading newspapers withdrew their endorsements, and republicans including paul ryan called for an apology. But gianforte, a technology entrepreneur, managed to hang on, helped by the fact that more than 200,000 of the state's 700,000 eligible voters had cast early ballots, the washington post reports. Quist adviser matt mckenna accused gianforte of running an ugly campaign and said that despite the win, gianforte's political career is doomed, with the governor's office now probably out of reach and jail still a possibility.",

They weren't far off, reports quartz. After two years of digging in harlaa, archaeologists have found ancient beads in almost every color of the rainbow, crafted of rock crystal, carnelian, and glass; cowry shells; and various pottery pieces — evidence of an ancient city that traded with china, india, and the maldives between the 10th and 15th centuries. \" this discovery revolutionizes our understanding of trade in an archaeologically neglected part of ethiopia, \" archaeologist timothy insoll says in a release. \" what we have found shows this area was the center of trade in that region. \" researchers — who uncovered a jewelry workshop, per the telegraph — believe the center was known for its high-quality jewelry made with silver, bronze, glass, and semi-precious stones from as far away as india. The jewelry was traded with people \" in the red sea, indian ocean, and possibly as far away as the arabian gulf, \" insoll says. It isn't clear what residents received in return, though shells; pottery from madagascar, the maldives, yemen, and china; and bronze and silver coins from 13th-century egypt were found.

Police there say the 19-year-old's body was found in a dry moat at the bottom of a \" significant drop, \" but some discrepancies have since popped up between what's been circulating online and what really happened: dombroksi's body wasn't tied up, as had been reported in some circles, and he still had his wallet and cellphone with him, throwing a possible wrench in the theory someone else may have been involved. The \" double-edged sword \" of social media \" certainly assisted us in the early stage of this investigation, but what can happen is that untruths are spread, \" superintendent sean field-lament says, adding that the fbi is assisting in the case. What is known about the final hours of dombroski, on the island for a rugby tourney with the st. Joseph's university team: he was seen by friends at a local bar around midnight saturday, then spotted on cctv on two streets nearby about an hour later, checking his phone. His body was found around 4pm monday, not far from his cctv location. \" foul play is not ruled out right now, \" a bermuda police service official said at a monday press conference, per usa today, with field-lament adding police are keeping an \" open mind. \" a local detective tells the ap there's no evidence dombroski had overimbibed at the bar or that alcohol played a role in his death. Meanwhile, his mom says he'd had a hurt arm and had left the bar early because of it. \" he wasn't in a celebratory kind of mood, \" she says. An autopsy will be conducted wednesday, per abc news.",

Williams began to feel short of breath and, with a pulmonary embolism in her history, asked for a ct scan. Doctors didn't listen at first, but a scan eventually revealed several small blood clots in williams ' lungs, and she was given a blood thinner. That in turn caused hemorrhaging at the site of her wound, which opened in a coughing fit. Williams would undergo an additional surgery to insert a filter into a major vein before the week was up. Says now-husband alexis ohanian, \" consider for a moment that your body is one of the greatest things on this planet, and you're trapped in it. \" now eying a march return to tennis, williams seems in a better place, at least mentally.

            "On a moist south florida morning at the end of a relentless hurricane season, their wedding only a week away, serena williams and alexis ohanian are seated side by side at their long kitchen table discussing the marshmallow test. Some 50 years ago, in a famous experiment, the stanford university psychologist walter mischel invited children to choose between a small immediate reward, such as a marshmallow, or, if they could sit and wait for fifteen minutes, a larger prize. The children who found ways to stave off temptation — by singing songs or pulling pigtails — went on to have higher sat scores and lower body-mass indexes than their ravenous peers. \"i would have eaten that marshmallow, \" says serena, who, in conspicuous contrast to that image, sips a radioactive-looking broth, which she nudged her chef to prepare after reading online that ginger and turmeric were supposed to aid in breast-milk production. She positions this tincture on a stack of gold lamé swatches: golden harvest, gold l ' amour, golden daydream, victorian gold. One of these will be selected for the tablecloths at the wedding dinner. Thinking better of her coaster choice, she shifts her glass to a stack of photocopied pages from assorted newborn instruction manuals. Serena loves printing and collating and stacking. She loves paper. She is the analog to her",

The test registered as a 5.3-magnitude quake; middlebury institute expert jeffrey lewis tells reuters that signals a blast of up to 30 kilotons, which would make the north korean bomb bigger than the one the us dropped on hiroshima in 1945. South korean defense officials say the blast was closer to 10 kilotons, which is still nearly twice the size of the bomb pyongyang is believed to have detonated in january, the wall street journal reports. The nuclear test, which took place on the 68th anniversary of north korea's founding, is the country's fifth. \" this has definitely put on a higher level ( the north's ) technology of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic rockets, \" said a statement out of the north. Pyongyang says it will now be able to produce \" at will \" smaller nuclear warheads. The white house says president obama, who is on his way home from asia, spoke to south korean president park geun-hye and japanese prime minister shinzo abe after the test. China, pyongyang's only major ally, slammed the country for conducting the test with \" disregard \" for international objections and said it's monitoring border areas for radiation. North korea expert koh yu-hwan at seoul's dongguk university says the test may have been conducted to show that sanctions aren't hurting north korea's nuclear program. \" it seems that the north has decided to play an ' end game ' where they push things to see how far they can go, \" he tells the ap. \" it's already being heavily sanctioned and there will be little room for any new sanctions that will meaningfully hurt them more. \"",

Some highlights from a new study, as noted by the boston globe, usa today, the new york times, and ap: eighteen women a day die from a prescription drug overdose. Overall, men are still more likely to die from such overdoses — 23,000 vs. 15,300 in 2010 — but women are catching up. The rate of fatal overdoses among women rose about fivefold between 1999 and 2010, while the rate among men tripled. The biggest increases in deaths were in women ages 45 through 54, and 55 through 64. The rate for each of group more than tripled over the last decade. Drug overdoses now claim more women's lives than car accidents or cervical cancer. Why? some theories floated include women's smaller body masses, a growing body of research suggesting they suffer more more chronic pain than men, and their propensity to go \" doctor shopping \" — visiting physicians until they find one willing to write prescriptions. \" mothers, wives, sisters and daughters are dying at rates that we have never seen before, \" says cdc chief thomas frieden, who wants the study to be a wake-up call to doctors.",

His brainchild: charge customers between $ 8 and $ 10 for a potato, write a custom message on it with a pilot g210 retractable rollerball pen, and mail it ( anonymously ) to the recipient of the customer's choice. \" i would say the two things that hold everyone back in life is fear and doubt, \" he says, explaining what drew him to this project. \" the fear of failure and the fear of wasting your time, and the doubt that you can actually achieve something big on a huge scale. \" craig knew soon after promoting his service that \" huge \" was an apt way to describe public reaction. At the very least, he proved wrong his girlfriend, who had proclaimed, \" you will not sell a single potato. \" \" on our second day that we were live … we started promoting it on reddit and we got $ 2,000 in orders, and i just knew this was it, \" he tells wfaa. They've sold more than 2,000 tubers since the site's launch in may. What's really \" cool, \" according to craig, is that \" it takes me about 30 seconds to write on a potato. \" and that, \" in some sort of weird way, we've had an impact on somebody's life — even for a split second, \" he says. He also may have become, as brobible notes, \" the first man in history who figured out how to make reddit profitable. \" ( just don't send potatoes to this guy, whatever you do. )",

Jay, for those who didn't listen to the 12-episode series, is the person who, at 18, told police and the court that he helped his friend adnan syed, lee's 17-year-old ex-boyfriend, dump lee's body after syed murdered her. Syed was convicted of the crime and is serving a life sentence, though he's always maintained his innocence; the podcast — a spinoff of this american life — investigated the question of whether he did it. Host sarah koenig was only able to speak to jay once, and not formally, but now he's given an interview to the intercept. ( koenig never revealed his last name — it's wilds. ) highlights from part 1: why he's talking: he \" feels strongly that he was unfairly depicted by koenig and that she painted a highly misleading portrayal of him and his role in the case, \" writes interviewer natasha vargas-cooper. Why he helped adnan: \" at the time i was convinced that i would be going to jail for a long time if he turned me in for drug dealing, especially to high school kids. I was also running [ drug ] operations from my grandmother's house. So that would ruin her life, too, \" jay says, adding that adnan knew he was scared of that exact thing. He also notes that baltimore culture played a role: \" this is where the'stop snitching ' video comes from.... This is where people would have their house firebombed and still tell the police they knew nothing about it. \" how he lays out the timeline: he says he and adnan were ditching last period together when adnan decided to lend jay his car and cellphone so jay could go buy a present for his girlfriend while adnan went back to school for practice. Later, adnan calls asking jay to pick him up at best buy, where adnan tells him he killed hae, but jay doesn't see hae's body or her car. This is between 3pm and 4pm, he says. Jay and adnan leave the best buy to smoke pot at jay's friend cathy's house, and after adnan gets a call from the police, he starts panicking and wants to part ways. He drives off; jay gets home around 6pm, but at some point adnan calls from outside jay '",

About a month later, police uncovered her body in a nearby park; an autopsy would later find that she was choked to death. Lee's ex-boyfriend, adnan syed, 17, became the primary suspect in her homicide after an anonymous caller told the police to investigate him. In february of 2000, syed was found guilty of murdering lee. Syed is currently serving a life sentence. The star witness at syed's trial was jay wilds, a former classmate who testified that he helped syed dispose of lee's body.

        "summary": "Do you line up bumper-to-bumper when approaching a traffic light? though driver training groups say it's a no-no likely to increase one's risk of a collision, researchers at the virginia tech college of engineering say it's a \" widely accepted \" practice based on the idea that \" the closer a car is to a traffic light, the more likely that car will be to pass through the intersection before the light turns red again. \" the science behind that: well, there isn't any. After recording footage of 10 volunteer drivers at traffic lights, researchers say in a release that those who stopped close to cars in front of them, and therefore closer to traffic lights, gained no advantage over drivers who stopped at a distance of up to 25 feet, because the former group had to establish space before accelerating once the light turned green. The research, published in the new journal of physics, also confirmed that tailgating leads to more rear-end collisions. \" when my father was teaching me how to drive, he told me that to prevent an accident, you should stop so you can easily see the rear bumper of the car in front of you at a traffic light, \" says researcher farzad ahmadi. But \" i've never done that until i analyzed the data of this experiment. \" it shows \" there's no point in getting closer to the car in front of you when traffic comes to a stop, \" adds study co-author jonathan boreyko. In other cases, it does pay to get close, however. A similar experiment performed using pedestrians found \" the closer people got to each other, the faster they could empty the line \" since humans can accelerate \" very quickly, \" boreyko says.

            "It is already well known that the saturation flow rate of vehicles passing through a green light is generally fixed around 1500 – 1800 vphg ( vehicles per hour of green ) over a wide variety of natural driving conditions [ 42 – 44 ]. However, this is because the saturation flow rate only considers the steady-state case of cars that are already crossing the intersection with a constant liquid-phase headway ( figure c2 ( a ) ) [ 45 – 47 ], thus ignoring the initial start-up lost time where the solid-to-liquid transition actually occurs. Our focus here is therefore not on the saturation flow rate, but on the start-up lost time ( i.e. Departure flow rate ) which considers the time required for the first four cars in the queue to cross the intersection when the light first turns green. By breaking up the total time required for all 10 cars to cross the intersection into the transient and steady times, we observe that both the departure flow rate and the saturation flow rate are insensitive to for all solid and liquid-phase packing densities ( figures 3 ( a ), c2 ( b ) ). By definition, it is obvious that the saturation flow rate is independent of, so we emphasize that our surprising finding is that even the start-up lost time is invariant with due to the effect of latent heat.

The raw images are being fed into a photo stream on nasa's website, and while they lack detailed captions and annotations, they provide entrancing views of the planet's complex atmosphere. In the maneuver that sent cassini between saturn and its rings, the craft went over the planet's north pole, where it captured the first high-resolution image of the mammoth storm back in 2013. The eye of the storm was measured at more than 1,000 miles wide.

Journalists from the daily mirror watched as, day after day, letwin walked around a london park reading sensitive documents before dumping them in the trash. In one case, he simply handed a bundle of documents to a park cleaner. The papers letwin discarded on his morning walks included correspondence about the transportation of terror suspects and about al-qaeda's connections in pakistan. Letwin, a former philosophy lecturer at cambridge, is considered one of the smartest members of cameron's government, but he's far from streetwise, the telegraph notes. In 2002 his london home was robbed in the early hours of the morning by a stranger who had asked to use the bathroom.",

        "summary": "Donald trump's new \" pay to play \" trouble continues to generate negative headlines for the candidate. On wednesday, campaign manager kellyanne conway found herself fending off questions from george stephanopoulos of abc on whether her boss used a big political donation to sway florida's attorney general into skipping an investigation into trump university, reports politico. Conway dismissed the allegations as a non-story and accused hillary clinton of being the real pay-to-play scoundrel. The issue surfaced earlier this week when the washington post reported that trump had paid a $ 2,500 irs fine for making an illegal $ 25,000 contribution to attorney general pam bondi's pac in 2013. The donation violated federal tax regulations because it came from his charitable organization, the trump foundation. The trump campaign has called it more of a clerical error than anything else, but critics are pouncing at the timing: it came while bondi was considering whether to join a multi-state investigation of trump's real-estate program; she ultimately did not do so. It also flips a big narrative of the campaign: trump has long accused clinton of pay-to-play politics, and now he's under scrutiny for the same. Both the new york times and the miami herald editorial pages are calling for a deeper investigation into the controversy. And the times has a separate front-page news story that explores how the irs fine \" is only the latest slap of his wrist in a decades-long record of shattering political donation limits and circumventing the rules governing contributions and lobbying. \"",

Elba esther gordillo was arrested on corruption charges last night after landing near mexico city in a private plane, reports the ap. It's things like private planes that appear to be the problem: the 68-year-old heads the country's 1.5 million-member teachers ' union, which the bbc describes as latin america's most powerful union, and prosecutors accuse her of embezzling more than $ 150 million from its funds to fund a lavish lifestyle of planes, $ 17,000 of plastic surgery, and designer clothing. Gordillo allegedly used the funds to pay for two homes near san diego; $ 2.1 million was also reportedly transferred to a neiman marcus account, reports the new york times. The transactions are said to have occurred between 2008 and 2012. Some $ 2 million of union money was allegedly funneled into accounts in switzerland and liechtenstein, reports the afp. The ap notes that she was paid about $ 72,000 a year, but was known to wear $ 1,200 shoes and carry a $ 5,500 purse. The bbc explains that the arrest came just a day after president enrique peña nieto instituted sweeping reforms designed to mend a problematic teaching system, in which positions can be inherited, dead teachers are sometimes paid, and regular assessments aren't conducted. Gordillo was seen as a key obstacle to reform.",

        "summary": "The supreme court sounded deeply divided today as it heard arguments in a politically charged challenge to the affordable care act's contraceptive mandate, with its women on one side and its conservatives on the other. The hearing combined two cases — sebelius v. Hobby lobby and conestoga wood specialties v. Sebelius — in which companies argued that providing employees with plans covering certain kinds of contraception violated their religious principles. Here's how the questioning went down: the court's women came out swinging in the first half of the hearing, according to time. Sonia sotomayor asked the challengers if a company could also object to vaccinations or blood transfusions. Elena kagan said they were trying to use an \" uncontroversial law \" — 1993's religious freedom restoration act — to upend \" the entire us code. \" but in the second half of the hearing, the court's conservatives were more aggressive, and they sounded so sympathetic to the challengers that the la times ' headline was \" justices sound ready to reject contraceptives mandate. \" \" the ultimate outcome, it seemed, will depend upon how justice kennedy makes up his mind, \" writes lyle denniston at scotusblog. \" there was very little doubt where the other eight justices would wind up: split four to four. \" and kennedy's position was hard to read. In the first half, kennedy sounded like he was with the liberals. At one point, he asked what rights female employees had if their employers ordered them to wear burkas, according to the ap. But later, kennedy swerved the other way. \" a profit corporation could be forced in principle to pay for abortions, \" he told the solicitor general. \" your reasoning would permit it. \" there were also signs that the justices were looking for a third way. Kennedy seemed amenable to kagan and sotomayor's point that companies weren't being forced to pay for contraception; they could pay a tax penalty instead. John roberts suggested that many slippery slope concerns could be headed off by limiting the ruling to closely-held corporations like hobby lobby, which the wall street journal saw as \" tipping his hand. \" stephen breyer sounded open to that solution as well.",

( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — the supreme court seemed divided tuesday over whether employers'religious beliefs can free them from a part of the new health care law that requires that they provide coverage of birth control for employees at no extra charge. The case involves family-owned companies that provide health insurance to their employees, but object to covering certain methods of birth control that they say can work after conception, in violation of their religious beliefs.

Kennedy gave them some help, and then the scene shifted entirely, and the conservatives had their chance — and, again, kennedy provided them with some support. So went the argument in the combined cases of sebelius v. Hobby lobby stores and conestoga wood specialties v. Sebelius.

The tuesday explosion happened at a shipping facility about an hour away from austin in schertz. But police think somebody sent the package to schertz from a fedex office store in the austin suburb of sunset valley, reports the american-statesman. Better yet, the office store has no drop-off option, meaning the person who mailed the package needed to go inside, and thus could be on the store's surveillance video. The package exploded on a conveyor belt at the schertz facility, though it was supposed to be shipped back out to an unspecified address in austin. A nearby employee suffered ringing in her ears, but that was the extent of injuries. The store in sunset valley is near the location of sunday night's bombing that injured two men. Authorities can't say for sure whether the schertz explosive is linked to the four earlier bombs, but austin police were investigating on that likelihood. One other development that has apparently fizzled: police initially said they found a second, unexploded device at the schertz fedex facility, which could have provided insights into who was putting the bombs together. However, police later backtracked, saying san antonio police chief william mcmanus \" misspoke \" with those comments, per the washington post. \" there is no secondary device at the schertz facility, \" says a spokesperson.",

The poor guy has been replaced by artificial insemination. That's because nearly 90 % of today's pig farmers inseminate sows artificially, up from 2 % to 4 % in the 1980s, a swine-breeding specialist tells pacific standard. Why the change? well, a single boar ejaculation can impregnate many sows, and the resulting piglets will be pretty similar. \" if we sit down to dinner at a restaurant, both order a pork chop and yours is twice as big as mine, i might go away unhappy, \" a researcher says. It's also easier to have fedex or a retired farmhand transport a bag of semen than to move boars between big, modern, specialized farms, where sows and piglets are kept in separate facilities; now one boar can do the job at a 300-sow farm that would have previously required 20. One downside: a study found that sows in spain were failing to reproduce because of chemicals in chinese-made semen-storage bags, national geographic reports; the bags were replaced and the pigs ' fertility rebounded. On a more positive note for pigs, consumer pressure is leading big us pork producers to put pigs in roomier, shared pens instead of small spaces where they have no room to turn around, the minneapolis star tribune reports.

Gov. Gary herbert's resolution, more general statement than punishable mandate, says porn is \" a public health hazard leading to a broad spectrum of individual and public health impacts and societal harms, \" with \" detrimental effects \" including the objectification of women, the linking of violence toward women and children with pleasure, and the promotion of sex trafficking, prostitution, and child porn, as well as biological addiction, emotional issues, and even changes in brain development, per the new york daily news. Although the resolution won't actually come with penalties for porn-related infractions, the related hb 155 will, specifically for computer techs who don't report child porn while maintaining or fixing equipment. A \" willful failure to report the child pornography \" could result in a class b misdemeanor. State sen. Todd weiler, sponsor of both measures, told the salt lake tribune in february that \" pornography [ addiction ] today is like tobacco was 70 years ago. \" not everyone's on the anti-porn bandwagon, including sex columnist dan savage, who told cnn last year that humans have a \" hard-wired desire for variety \" that can be harmlessly satisfied through porn. Still others don't like utah putting \" a public health spin on a private issue, \" as the daily news frames it. And some researchers remain skeptical that porn is causing some of the issues cited. \" i think the conclusions we can draw from the science are very limited, \" american academy of pediatrics doctor david hill tells the atlantic.

        "summary": "Thanks to that old wet blanket known as science, we now have compelling evidence that your dog hates it when you hug him. Dr. Stanley coren, a professor of psychology specializing in canine behavior, says dogs nearly always show signs of stress or anxiety when being embraced, the san francisco chronicle reports. According to psychology today, those signs include avoiding eye contact, showing the whites of their eyes, lowering their ears, yawning, licking, and raising a paw. And while the idea that dogs hate hugs is \" widely accepted \" by experts ( though not by dog owners ), coren found a lack of scientific research on the subject. So he decided to study 250 photos of people hugging dogs found randomly on the internet ( unsurprisingly, there were plenty to choose from ). \" i can summarize the data quite simply, \" coren writes in psychology today. \" the internet contains many pictures of happy people hugging what appear to be unhappy dogs. \" he found the dogs in 81.6 % of the photos showed at least one sign of \" discomfort, stress, or anxiety. \" only 7.6 % of the dogs appeared comfortable with being hugged. \" more than four out of five dogs find this human expression of affection to be unpleasant, \" coren writes. And that's the key: dogs aren't people. A dog's natural impulse when faced with a threat is to run away, new york magazine reports. By embracing a dog, you take away its ability to deal with potential threats. Instead of hugs, coren recommends showing affection through pets, treats, or playtime.

The way it works is that dogs ( often dogs, but sometimes just well-behaved pets ) are brought to campus and students get a chance to pet and interact with the dogs. The rationale here is that during exam periods stress levels run high in the student population, and there is ample evidence that shows that dogs can reduce stress levels.

            "House republicans were gearing up to ditch a bipartisan senate bill on tuesday that would extend a federal payroll tax holiday for two months, charging that the deal represented the old ways of doing business that they were elected to change. For the first time in a month of partisan sparring over the tax break, neither party appeared confident that the issue would be resolved, averting a january tax increase for 160 million american workers. \"we were elected for a reason, \" freshman rep. Renee l. Ellmers ( r-n.c. ) said after a republican huddle in a capitol basement meeting room monday night. \"that was because the american people were tired of business as usual. \" at the raucous, two-hour closed-door meeting, house republicans compared themselves to the underdog, principled scots in the movie \"braveheart \" and, over takeout chicken sandwiches, promised to knock down the senate bill. Senate democrats accused house speaker john a. Boehner ( r-ohio ) and his leadership team of walking away from the deal as a capitulation to tea-party elements and said they had no plans to reopen talks. They said that if the house rejects a deal that was adopted in the senate on an 89 to 10 vote, it would amount to nixing the tax cut. \"it's high-stakes poker, \" said rep. Thomas j. Rooney ( r-fla. ) of the stalemate with the senate",
            "The house intends to vote down a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut that cleared the senate late last week, speaker john boehner said monday, and request immediate negotiations on a full-year renewal that can provide \" certainty for people who are trying to create jobs. \" in this sunday, dec. 18, 2011, photo provided by nbc news, speaker of the house, rep. John boehner, r-ohio, appears on nbc's \" meet the press \" in washington. House republicans said sunday they oppose a... ( associated press ) \" i don't believe the differences between the house and senate are that great, \" boehner said at a news conference, although he provided no estimate on how long it might take to produce a compromise. Without action by congress, both the payroll tax cut and a program for long-term unemployment benefits will expire on jan. 1. Boehner spoke after a chaotic weekend in which senate leaders first failed to agree on a full-year bill, then coalesced around the two-month-extension that passed overwhelmingly, only to spark a revolt among gop conservatives in the house. There was no immediate reaction from either the white house or leaders in the senate, which adjourned for the year shortly after approving its version of the bill. The revolt of the rank and file placed boehner and republicans in a difficult position"

He told the paramedics he felt like \"he's trippin ' \" but declined to go to the hospital, retiring to his bed instead. As police were investigating, one of the adult sons returned to the home, confirmed that the brownies contained marijuana, and said that they belonged to his siblings. As of press time, omaha police have not filed any charges over the marijuana. Nebraska is one of eleven states that decriminalized marijuana possession in the 1970s. Possession of marijuana less than one ounce is merely a ticket for a first infraction with a $ 300 fine. A second charge is a misdemeanor with a $ 500 fine, but no jail time.
