But the real problem, michael wolff writes in usa today, is that ads in every medium have become less persuasive, and wolff thinks he knows why: \" there are no writers in advertising anymore. Johnny who can't write has gone into advertising. \" according to one media consultant, today's so-called copywriters avoid the written word at all costs, and their attempts at it tend to produce \" scary, semi-literate gibberish. \" today's ad men seem convinced that all that matters are visuals, but great campaigns almost always revolve around text. \" they tell a story, they make a case, they offer a big idea. \" steve jobs used to demand that anyone put on apple's account be a solid writer. \" pictures are easy, \" he reasoned. \" words are hard. \" wolff agrees, and so does usa today. So at his urging they're holding a print ad competition, giving out $ 1 million worth of free ad pages to whoever can best fill them \" with cleverness, wit, style, economy of words. \" click for wolff's full column.",

And i certainly haven't been fair to myself: for too many years i've been on the sidelines of boston's gay community but not in the game — figuratively and literally, as i feel i would have had a pretty good career in the ( gay ) beantown softball league. Buckley deserves credit for being open with himself, his co-workers, his readers, and his sources. Buckely is one of the most well-known members of boston's sports media — both through his herald column and his regular appearances on the weei sports talk radio station ( which, it should be said, has a tendency toward overly macho, homophobic moments ) — so it definitively"

        "summary": "Scientists are raising alarm bells after two studies found that the gulf stream — an ocean current key to regulating earth's climate — is the weakest it's been in 1,600 years, the guardian reports. The culprit is apparently melting sea ice and glaciers, which inject fresh water into the north atlantic and weaken the stream. \" fiddling with [ the gulf stream ] is very dangerous, because you may well trigger some surprises, \" says climate scientist stefan rahmstorf. \" i wish i knew where this critical tipping point is, but that is unfortunately just what we don't know. \" if the stream dies, scientists say, its equatorial heat would stop reaching the north atlantic — plunging europe into bone-numbing winters and affecting weather worldwide. Even subtler changes \" could wreak havoc \" on the atlantic ocean's \" delicate ecosystems, \" smithsonian reports. The studies differ in approach and timeline but both say the gulf stream has diminished by about 15 %, nature reports. One study spotted it by measuring sediment on the ocean floor and says the problem began when the little ice age subsided around 1850. The other, which analyzed sea surface temperatures combined with advanced climate simulations, says the decline started around 50 years ago. But both see human-influenced climate change as a cause, nature says. And with greenland's huge ice cap melting at a historic rate, some say the paris climate agreement is our only hope. \" if we can keep the temperature rise to well below 2c as agreed in the paris agreement, i think we run a small risk of crossing this collapse tipping point, \" says rahmstorf. ( meanwhile the doomsday clock has ticked 30 seconds closer to \" midnight. \" )",

Now the swedish retailer is pleading with others to stop holding \" non-sponsored sleepovers \" in its stores, citing safety issues and warning of possible trespassing charges, the bbc reports. The guardian notes that about 10 incidents of people hiding until closing time have been logged over the past year, including in the us, canada, britain, belgium, the netherlands, sweden, japan, australia, and poland. The latest happened last weekend in sweden, when two 14-year-olds stayed over in jonkoping. \" we appreciate that people are interested in ikea and want to create fun experiences, \" says an ikea rep tells the bbc, before making clear that sleepovers aren't allowed. The pranks were apparently spurred by an august youtube video showing what happened overnight in a belgian ikea when two teens hid in wardrobes until the store closed, then filmed their exploits. The video, which has nearly 2 million views, shows them jumping on beds, reading bedtime stories, and filling out ratings forms ( using swedish meatball as ratings icons ) for the food, drink, and facilities. They left the building undetected when the store opened the next day.

Us authorities also believe deyun shi, 44, attempted to kill his wife, reuters reports. Police say shi learned thursday that his wife planned to divorce him, the los angeles times reports. That night, shi returned to the family home in la cañada flintridge, which he had moved out of, and attacked his wife with a woodcutting tool. He left after his son, 15, stepped in. Police think he later drove to the arcadia home where his nephews lived, per the times. The boys had been left sleeping while their parents visited shi's wife at the hospital. Later, the mother discovered one of the boys bleeding and unresponsive. Both boys suffered blunt-force trauma and were pronounced dead at the scene. While hong kong has an extradition treaty with the us, the times reports, the proceedings could be complicated if shi will face the death penalty, which hong kong does not have. \" any possibility of execution will be a reason for hong kong not to surrender, \" one expert tells the times. A us lawyer providing legal assistance to shi says he's \" interested in looking into \" using that to delay or stop extradition. Before moving to the us about a year ago, shi, who appears to have run an importing business here, had several businesses in shenzhen, china, the times reports, citing chinese media reports that say shi was a \" central figure \" in at least four bribery cases that ended with three officials going to prison. It is unclear, the times reports, if chinese authorities are interested in having shi sent back to them.",

He made his first public appearance in about a year today and looked noticeably healthier, maybe even a little cocky, according to several media accounts. Mubarak showed up for the start of his retrial on charges that he ordered the killing of protesters near the end of his rein, but legal proceedings crashed to a halt after only a few minutes when the judge recused himself and referred the case to another court. Observers seem split on whether the delay is good or bad news for mubarak, but descriptions of the former president were universally positive: guardian: \" he appeared in much better health than in his last ( appearance ). He arrived in court wearing sunglasses, smiled and waved at onlookers, and seemed relaxed — perhaps hopeful that saturday's proceedings would secure his release. \" new york times: \" he waved to the courtroom several times with the signature turn of the wrist he used as an all-powerful autocrat addressing his people. Though his lips were pursed, he turned up the corners of his mouth several times in an unmistakable smile. No longer stone-faced and sullen, he chatted with his sons, or sat with his fingers pressed together in front of his chin as though he were listening in concentration from behind a desk in his office. \" reuters: \" propped up on a gurney in a cage with the other defendants, he looked fitter and more relaxed than on previous appearances in the dock, holding animated conversations with his son gamal, and occasionally smiling and waving to people in the courtroom. \" associated press: \" in earlier court appearances, mubarak's two sons would often stand to shield their father from the cameras, but at the start of the new trial mubarak appeared to be grinning at times as he waved to his supporters. His wave seemed to suggest a nod to increasing nostalgia among some egyptians for his rule, when tourism and other vital economic pillars fared better. \"",

        "summary": "Spoilers are a scourge of the internet age: between social media and entertainment sites, it can be tough to avoid learning what happened in the latest game of thrones before you watch it. Making things even more complicated, a wired survey finds that people have very different views of proper spoiler conduct: some 34 %, for instance, say tv plot details can be revealed \" a day or two \" after airing, while 20 % say you should wait a few weeks, and 11 % say it's never ok to reveal them. There's also disagreement on whether it's the responsibility of those who've seen the show to avoid revealing spoilers — or the responsibility of those who haven't seen it to avoid learning them. In an effort to calm the madness, laura hudson provides a guide to spoiler courtesy. Among its highlights: you can talk about sports and reality show endings right away, but hold off a few days for scripted tv and a week for a movie. If you're going to be upset about live-blogs of a show, simply don't go on twitter during the show. Don't read articles about shows you don't want to ruin. But those writing the articles should avoid putting spoilers in headlines shortly after an episode airs. If you love it, just watch it: \" the only way to be truly safe from spoilers is to transform them into something else: information you already know. \" hudson is, of course, just one voice among many: at vulture in 2008, dan kois offered his own guidelines for when spoilers should be allowed in headlines ( three days after a scripted tv show airs ) and when they can appear within articles specifically about a show ( the day after an episode airs ). The new york post and the ap have also made some suggestions — the post says seasons or series that go out with a bang can be freely discussed within 24 hours of the finale, while the ap talks to an expert who points out that no one has a right to \" spoiler alerts. \"",

Locals are trying to reconcile their home with the info divulged in the book — especially missoula county attorney kirsten pabst, chief deputy prosecutor during the years krakauer examined, who tells the times the author \" chose not to interview me \" ( he says he sent her a list of qs that went unanswered ).

The decision to pull out of the universal post union was described by two administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on the record. Trump argues that the 144-year-old global shipping treaty benefits china and other countries at the expense of u.s. Businesses — making it cheaper to ship packages from beijing to new york than from san francisco to the u.s. East coast, which particularly benefits chinese manufacturers. The officials say the treaty is used by shippers of the narcotic fentanyl to the u.s. From china. The u.s. Is willing to renegotiate the treaty over the next year but will leave the union if no agreement can be",

Trump volleyed billions of dollars in tariffs with china over the summer, raising concerns of higher domestic manufacturing costs. A senior administration official said wednesday that the withdrawal from the postal agreement is not related to the tariffs, but the move is aimed at protecting u.s. Manufacturers and the u.s. Postal system. Story continued below the universal postal union, a body of the united nations"

Amazon's jeff bezos is still up in the air, while twitter's jack dorsey, uber's travis kalanick, and netflix's reed hastings have reportedly declined. No one's quite sure what trump has planned for the itinerary, but catz plans to tell trump \" we are with him and are here to help in any way we can.

Ian bogost relays for the atlantic his former job working for a hollywood production company and offers his insights into why he thinks \" donald trump is the michael bay of politics \" and how, for people like trump who nab respect thanks to their wealth and attention-grabbing personalities, \" the resulting power can be lorded over those who cannot, or will not, refuse to pledge fealty to it. \" gizmodo gets into why the summit could be \" super awkward, \" notably because trump has \" consistently trash-talked \" silicon valley. The site has put together what it calls \" a brief list of his greatest tech-hating hits, \" including an especially juicy tweet about sandberg.

        "summary": "A recording of the current president of the united states discussing a hush money payment involving a former playboy model over an alleged affair was made public tuesday night — and the biggest controversy is over the proposed method of payment. In the recording aired by cnn, trump talks to attorney michael cohen about buying the rights to karen mcdougal's story about the alleged affair from the parent company of the national enquirer, which paid $ 150,000 for it but never published it, the bbc reports. \" so, what do we got to pay for this? one-fifty? \" trump says at one point. They discuss financing and trump can be heard saying \" pay with cash, \" but the recording is muffled and it's not clear exactly what the sentence was. The recording was made around two months before the 2016 election and was among those seized in a law enforcement raid on cohen's office. Cohen's lawyer, lanny davis, argues that the recording proves cohen wanted to handle the payment legally, through a company created for the purpose, while trump just wanted to pay cash, the guardian reports. The payment was never made. The president's lawyer, rudy giuliani, claims trump did nothing wrong and was saying \" don't pay cash. \" \" that's open to interpretation, and we can have a fight about that, \" he tells the washington post. He says he spoke to trump tuesday night and the president is \" discouraged. \" \" he's disappointed his own lawyer recorded him, \" giuliani says.",

The release is the first confirmation of reports bin laden visited the west in his youth ( courtesy of his journal ) and also includes the first images of his son hamza bin laden as an adult ( courtesy of a wedding video ), according to cnn. The release also includes some odd items. While bin laden professed not to like britain, he apparently enjoyed parts of its culture — his computer contained episodes of mr. Bean and wallace and gromit, as well as more than 30 videos on crocheting. It also held various animated movies, such as cars and antz; national geographic specials like kung fu killers; and the documentary where in the world is osama bin laden? a gizmodo list of the 42 \" weirdest \" movies on bin laden's computer is topped by the youtube viral video \" charlie bit my finger \" ( but that was before they noticed bin laden had a video claiming sept. 11 was an inside job ).

Thanks to ian davies, an old buddy who submitted craven's geeky high school photo — complete with plaid sweater vest and a mouth full of braces — to reddit three years ago, craven became known as \" bad luck brian \": his likeness went viral, accompanied by user-generated text that poked fun of \" brian's \" often unfortunate conundrums ( check out featured memes on one of the various bad luck brian meme generator sites ). To date, craven estimates he's made between $ 15,000 and $ 20,000 from licensing and t-shirt deals, he tells jessica contrera, another former school acquaintance who interviewed him for the washington post. Craven first found out about his online notoriety when he got a voice mail from davies in january 2012 that said, \" dude, i just made you internet-famous, \" contrera writes. ( craven was also able to hold onto some anonymity since davies thought \" bad luck brian \" sounded catchier than \" bad luck kyle. \" ) his photo soon entered meme territory, garnering craven invites to internet conventions, t-shirts with his face on them, \" bad luck brian \" stuffed animals, and spots in volkswagen and realplayer ads. Although he retains his youtube, twitter, and instagram pages, the initial hubbub has died down, but he's staying busy taking care of his new dog louie and overseeing the logistics for building churches for his dad's construction business. About his alter ego, he tells contrera, \" it's something to show my grandkids one day, right? \" ( read the post to find out what kyle was like in high school. )",

        "summary": "Some 10.2 million people have paid for health insurance coverage under obamacare this year, but 6.4 million of those could lose their subsidies if the supreme court sides with the plaintiffs in king v. Burwell. A rep for the kaiser family foundation tells the washington post the new government figures offer the best assessment yet of how many americans will be affected by such a decision. \" these are the people we now know are receiving subsidies that would be lost if the court sides with the challengers, \" he says. The plaintiffs argue residents of 34 states who bought coverage on the federal exchange aren't entitled to tax credits due to four words at the heart of the affordable care act. Most who would be affected come from two large area groups: one covering florida, georgia, louisiana, north carolina, and texas, the other covering illinois, indiana, ohio, and wisconsin. At an average of $ 272 a month, the subsidies total $ 1.7 billion per month. Some 2.1 million people would lose $ 595 million in subsidies per month in texas and florida alone. If forced to pay the cost of coverage in full, subsidized enrollees would face an average effective premium increase of 287 %. Those in alaska and utah would face a 500 % increase; mississippi enrollees would see a 650 % hike, researchers say. The urban institute estimates two-thirds of those receiving subsidies would give up their coverage without help, politico reports. Those most at risk are white, employed, live in the south, and have modest incomes. If the supreme court revokes coverage, wisconsin gov. Scott walker and florida gov. Rick scott both say the federal government will need to come up with a solution. Pennsylvania is the only state to put forth a backup plan, reports the hill. Gov. Tom wolf says he will create a state-based exchange to save subsidies for 350,000 residents because it's \" the responsible thing to do. \"",

            "Germany's mystery \"autobahn sniper \" terrorised motorists for five years and baffled police. He fired more than 700 shots at passing vehicles, caused serious accidents and almost fatally wounding a woman driver who was hit in the throat by one of his bullets. But yesterday german federal criminal police said they had finally caught up with the gunman after mounting a massive search operation that involved installing car number plate detection devices across germany, the use of decoy lorries and the offer of a € 100,000 ( £ 85,000 ) reward. Police said a 57-year-old lorry driver who was apprehended in the eifel region of western germany at the weekend had admitted carrying out the attacks and had shown them the private arsenal of weapons he used. The sniper specialised in shooting from his lorry cab at traffic coming towards him down the opposite lane of the autobahn. In 2009, a woman was seriously injured after being hit in the throat by one of his rounds as she was driving near the city of würzburg. Police said the sniper's favourite targets were new cars being transported on the backs of lorries. The bullet holes in the vehicles were almost always discovered at the end of the journey, long after the gunman had fired at them. Police said that hidden devices which enabled them to log the number plates of millions of vehicles had enabled them to reconstruct the journeys taken by the vehicles which were shot at. On sunday, the collated data finally led them to the gunman."

        "summary": "Democrats see the senate seat held by arizona republican jeff flake as one of their few opportunities in 2018, and it looks like they ' ll be pinning their hopes on a centrist democrat with a track record of reaching across the aisle, the arizona republic reports. Us rep. Kyrsten sinema announced thursday she will be running for flake's seat. \" i really feel like i have a duty to serve and give back to this country, which has given so much to me, \" sinema says. She says her key issues in the campaign will be helping military veterans and easing regulations on businesses. Sinema's entry into the race makes things even harder for flake, who's facing a tough primary challenge from former senator kelli ward. According to the cook political report, a recent poll showed flake down 27 percentage points to ward and 7 points in a match up with sinema. Flake, who has faced criticism from conservatives for occasionally butting heads with president trump, is attempting to paint sinema as too liberal, with a spokesperson calling her \" out of touch. \" it's a plan the national republican senatorial committee is following. \"sinema has more in common with the failed, radical leadership of nancy pelosi than she does with arizonan families, \" states the nrsc, which accuses sinema of voting in \" lockstep \" with democrats. And while politico reports sinema was originally affiliated with the green party, accusations of being overly liberal aren't borne out by reality. Sinema didn't vote for pelosi for house leader, skipped an arizona rally for hillary clinton, and is a frequent cosponsor of republican bills. She's voted with the trump administration 49 % of the time, making her the third most gop-friendly democrat in congress since the election.",

While both sexes share many risk factors ( think high blood pressure, obesity, and smoking ), women have an additional set all their own. Pregnancy, childbirth, and hormones from birth control pills or post-menopausal therapy boost the risk of stroke, the no. 3 killer of women, say the guidelines from the american heart association and american stroke association, per reuters and the washington post. A few standout guidelines? women should track and work to control their blood pressure from an early age via a healthy diet. \" we're talking about being aware of blood pressure before you ever take birth-control medication, being aware of blood pressure before you ever get pregnant, \" says guidelines author cheryl bushnell. That's because combining high blood pressure with birth-control pills ups stroke risk; those with high blood pressure who become pregnant can suffer from preeclampsia, which can lead to stroke during or following delivery. Such pregnant women may want to take low-dose aspirin or calcium supplement therapy to reduce their risk of preeclampsia. More controversially, the guidelines recommend administering blood pressure medication to pregnant women with just moderately high blood pressure; the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists disagrees. \" we are going out on a limb, \" says bushnell. \" we don't want women to develop severe blood pressure. \"",

But some media outlets, such as buzzfeed, pointed out that the image contained plenty of hints that it was not legitimate, such as jubbal's sikh turban and the north american power outlets. Jubbal suspects someone involved in gamergate — a controversy involving misogyny, harassment, and gaming journalism — may be responsible, the bbc reports. In the past, he has drawn the ire of gamergaters for his criticism of the state of gaming.",

Officials say the missiles traveled around 125 miles. Pyongyang is trying to develop missiles capable of reaching the us mainland and the washington post reports that the pace of testing has been \" relentless: \" there were three missile launches in may, making it 16 for the year, meaning kim jong un has now ordered as many launches in 2017 alone as father kim jong il ordered during his 17 years as the country's supreme leader. The missiles, fired the day after south korea announced that it is delaying implementation of the thaad anti-missile system, landed in waters where the us aircraft carriers uss carl vinson and uss ronald reagan recently carried out drills with the south korean navy, the ap reports. Cnbc reports that pyongyang released a statement this week denouncing the us not for the drills, but for president trump's decision to pull the us out of the paris climate accord.

She had dark hair and looked about the same age but didn't look pregnant or anything like that. \" after she disappeared, family members said they were deeply concerned because she has a vascular condition that makes her unable to give birth without a c-section, the new york daily news reports.

The national post reports victoria ambrose was found guilty of breaking a distracted-driving law, after a university of guelph police officer whose vehicle was stopped next to hers at a red light in april says he noticed a \" glow \" in her car from an electronic device, per his testimony in front of justice of the peace lloyd phillipps. The cop added he saw ambrose glance up and down about four times and that she was slow to start moving when the light turned green. ( gizmodo notes unless the apple watch is in \" wrist raise \" mode, the user needs to tap the display once to activate it to check the time, then tap it again to deactivate. ) the cop says he had to shine a light to get her to go, at which point he pulled her over and ticketed her. The case came down to ontario's anti-distracted-driving law, which bans driving \" while holding or using a handheld wireless communication device. \" although ambrose tried to argue the apple watch shouldn't be considered a handheld device, phillipps said the watch was \" no less a source of distraction than a cellphone taped to someone's wrist \" and that it was \" abundantly clear, \" based on the cop's testimony, that ambrose was distracted. Gizmodo points out various studies that lend credence to the judge's decision, with research suggesting not only are hands-free devices in general not safer than handheld devices while driving, but also that smartwatches in particular slow down driver response time — and were found to be even more distracting than a regular smartphone. Ambrose was hit with a $ 400 fine for her time check. ( an apple watch turned out to be a lifesaver for this brooklyn man. )",

The accident occurred when brandy gonzalez was driving from nevada to idaho with son killian on may 22, and their car smashed into another after sliding on ice. \" we could hear a kid screaming, a little baby screaming, \" recalls leah woodward, who saw the accident with her husband and stopped to help. Her husband, joel, is a police officer who has first-responder training, notes the washington post. After he recognized that killian had a spinal injury and stabilized the boy's head, his wife held it straight until paramedics arrived about 30 minutes later. Killian had suffered from what's known informally as internal decapitation, which occurs \" when the ligaments, muscles and joints that connect the base of the skull to the top of the spine are damaged, \" explains the new york times. The survival rate is low, but today, the boy is eating, sitting up, and walking on his own. The injury happens more frequently to young children, typically in high-speed accidents, because that area of their bodies is still developing, notes the times. Killian's family says doctors expect he ' ll make a full recovery, which is all the more remarkable because he didn't need surgery or a halo brace — the usual necessities for survivors of such an injury. \"she saved my baby, \" his mom says of leah woodward. \"she gave him back. \" as for gonzalez herself, she broke her arm, femur, tibia, and ankle, but both she and her son are out of the hospital, notes leah woodward in a facebook update. \" there's a reason we're here and we're just going to try every day to figure out what that reason is, \" says gonzalez.

        "summary": "Unrest continues to spread through northern africa and the middle east, with protests rocking bahrain, yemen, libya, iran, and even iraq. The latest from yesterday and today, from the new york times, businessweek, and afp: in bahrain, the death toll after a surprise police attack on protesters rose to five. In yemen, protests — and fights between those for and against the government — reached their seventh consecutive day, with police firing automatic rifles into the air in an effort to keep the opposing sides apart. Yesterday, government supporters used electroshock batons against those protesting the president and one person was killed. In libya, protesters organized a \" day of rage \" today to challenge the 41-year rule of moammar gadhafi. At least four people were killed in clashes with security forces yesterday; one human rights group claims as many as 13 were killed by snipers and dozens wounded. In iran, students attempted to hold a memorial service for an art student killed in monday's protests yesterday, but authorities thwarted them and held an official funeral for saane zhaleh, calling him a vigilante. Even iraq saw protests yesterday, these over unemployment, unreliable electricity, and corruption in the government. Three were killed and protesters burned the governor's headquarters and house in the most violent protest since unrest began in iraq last month. The egyptian military issued an initial estimate of the death toll during its 18 days of unrest: at least 365 civilians dead, plus prisoners and police officers. All of this is putting the us in an awkward spot, experts say. \"for decades, the us sort of prioritized stability over democracy because of oil and israel, \" says one, but \"the current policy is not sustainable. \"",

        "summary": "This study might make you think twice about getting behind the wheel whether you've been drinking or not: about 1.8 % of american adults admitted to driving while impaired at least once over the previous 30 days, per a new cdc study of 2012 data. When that percentage is applied to the overall us population, it works out to an estimated 4.2 million adults. The frequency breakdown among those who copped to driving while under the influence: 58 % said they did it once in the last 30 days; 23 % said twice; 17 % said 3 – 10; and 0.8 % said daily. That works out to an estimated 121 million episodes per year, the study says. And the \" admitted \" part is key: experts say the figure is likely low since some offenders may not have confessed and drivers under 18 were left out. The worst offenders? young men. Males in general were involved in 80 % of cases, but those 21-34 had a role in 32 % of offenses, though that gender and age group makes up just 11 % of the population, report nbc news and livescience. Hawaii had the highest per-capita rate with 995 alcohol-impaired driving episodes annually per 1,000 people. Nebraska, north dakota, and wisconsin also had high rates at 955, 855, and 828 cases, respectively. Utah had the lowest rate with 217 episodes — not much of a surprise considering the state also had the lowest rate of adult drinkers at 31 %, compared to 65 % in wisconsin. Interestingly, the study also found that people who didn't religiously buckle up reported driving impaired three times more than those who always buckled up. \" fatalities among alcohol-impaired drivers could be substantially reduced if every state had a primary seat belt law, \" the team writes.

            "More than 4 million u.s. Adults admit they drink and drive at least sometimes, a number that adds up to more than 121 million times someone who has had one too many is on the road each year, the latest government survey finds. Drunk-driving laws help but there's another possible way to trim the numbers, the researchers said - by enforcing stricter seat-belt laws.

        "summary": "Angelina jolie's second directorial effort is unbroken, a much-hyped adaptation of laura hillenbrand's bestselling book. It tells the story of louis zamperini, an italian-american who, as richard corliss writes in time, \" lived three lives before he was 30 \": he competed in the 1936 olympics, was stranded on a raft for weeks after his b-24 crashed in the pacific during world war ii, and then was tortured as a prisoner of war in japan. Critics aren't exactly blown away by the movie: \" zamperini's life story is genuinely inspirational, but the movie seems fashioned as a standard-issue profile in courage, \" writes peter rainer in the christian science monitor, complaining of \" conventional \" directing. Zamperini is \" transformed into an almost saintlike figure. He would have been every bit as inspirational, even more so, without the halo. \" in the new yorker, david denby pulls no punches, calling the film \" an interminable, redundant, unnecessary epic devoted to suffering, suffering, suffering. \" jolie, he says, \" confuses long scenes of sadism with truth-telling. \" the film is well-shot and well-acted, writes donald clarke in the irish times. \" the only things missing are character and plot. \" but \" does unbroken really look like the work of a ' minimally talented spoiled brat '? well, it's better than at least half of george clooney's directorial output, and nobody's giving that silver fox metaphorical wedgies via leaked email. \" and corliss defends the film, even if it \" doesn't quite rise to enthralling. \" the movie received a huge amount of pre-release attention, and \" for many reviewers, the build-up led to a big breakdown when they finally saw it. Unbroken was just … a movie. \" ultimately, he calls it \" a grand, solid movie, \" with lead actor jack o ' connell as \" the part of unbroken that was truly worth the wait. \"",

They are a biological treasure trove. \" that's the takeaway from a new study on how the tiny insects manage to navigate thousands of miles from the us and canada to mexico: eli shlizerman of the university of washington and his team have \" cracked the secret \" of the compass the insects use, as science daily puts it. Azimuth neurons in the eyes track the sun's position, but in order to navigate by the sun, the insects need to know if it's morning ( ie, so the sun should be to the east ) or afternoon ( to the west ). And it was known the butterflies do indeed combine these two factors: timekeeping neurons in the antennae operate as a sort of clock. But as researcher steven reppert explains in a press release, \" how the clock and sun compass talk to each other in a way that leads to oriented flight behavior \" remained a mystery. So the team set out to model the \" control mechanisms \" involved and then see if their model \" could guarantee sustained navigation in the southwest direction. \" the press release gives a summary: \" after estimating the firing rates from neurons in the antennae and eyes, [ the team ] extrapolated how such neurons might interact with each other in a simplified model. Then, they built equations that would indicate whether a given flight angle was correct or if the butterfly needed to steer left or right in order to face southwest. \" and, voila: their model was able to predict the butterflies ' behavior. Shlizerman tells the bbc the research may help experts develop a robotic monarch butterfly able to track the migration. ( the world's longest-distance flier has been identified. )",

In that year a munich court sentenced john demjanjuk to five years in prison for complicity in the extermination of more than 28,000 jews at the sobibor camp, where he had served as a guard. The investigative office, set up in 1958, has carried out more than 7,000 probes but has no powers to charge suspects itself.

In that year a munich court sentenced john demjanjuk to five years in prison for complicity in the extermination of more than 28,000 jews at the sobibor camp, where he had served as a guard. The investigative office, set up in 1958, has carried out more than 7,000 probes but has no powers to charge suspects itself. Instead it sends case files to regional prosecutors who then decide whether to pursue suspects, who must also be judged fit to stand trial by the courts."

They accuse brown of taking cigars from the store and pushing an employee who asked him to pay up, reports usa today. Police say that brown's friend dorian johnson was with him at the store. A snippet from a police report, with the names of store employees redacted: \" as ( redacted ) was placing the boxes on the counter, brown grabbed a box of swisher sweets cigars and handed them to johnson who was standing behind brown.

Sami hafez enan, chief of staff of the armed forces. Both raised their standing with protesters by meeting with them during the unrest and making clear the military would not move against them, but neither is seen as a particularly strong advocate of democracy, reports the new york times. Their decision not to stand with mubarak was likely more of a political calculation and a nod to reality. Protesters have made clear, however, that they will demand more than lip service in the weeks ahead. Tantawi: at 75, he'd been in mubarak's inner circle for decades and is known as a canny operator within the political system. Wikileaks cables, however, portray him as resistant to change: \" he and mubarak are focused on regime stability and maintaining the status quo through the end of their time, \" read one us cable. \" they simply do not have the energy, inclination or world view to do anything differently. \" the bbc has a profile. Enan: believed to be in his early 60s, he'd be more likely to take over the military top spot under a civilian regime. He's seen as \" smart and innovative \" by americans he's dealt with, notes the times, and has even won praise as incorruptible from the muslim brotherhood. Reuters has a profile.",

In a press conference held today, mosby also said that the knife gray had clipped inside his pants pocket was not the switchblade officers alleged it was, but a legal knife — meaning there was no justifiable cause for his arrest, per the ap.

Mike pence today signed the controversial religious freedom restoration act into law — in a ceremony that was held behind closed doors for \" no particular reason, \" says his rep. What it is, and what it means for indiana, per the ap and indianapolis star: what the new law does: prohibits state and local laws that \" substantially burden \" the ability of people — including businesses and associations — to follow their religious beliefs. That means the government won't be able to compel people to provide such things as catering or photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds. Is the bill unique? no. While indiana is the first state to enact such a change this year among about a dozen where such proposals have been introduced, 19 other states have similar laws on the books. Pence's response to the criticism: \" this bill is not about discrimination, and if i thought it legalized discrimination in any way in indiana, i would have vetoed it. \" he also pointed to the existence of the federal religious freedom restoration act, which congress enacted in 1993. How it could hurt the state: some groups that hold conventions there say they may reconsider their plans to do so. The bill signing comes just more than a week before ncaa men's final four games at lucas oil stadium in downtown indianapolis; the ncaa says \" we are examining the details of this bill...

The incident allegedly took place last august in stockton mayor anthony silva's bedroom at the summer camp he runs for inner-city kids in need. According to the los angeles times, silva was arrested at the camp on thursday. Prosecutors say silva started recording the strip poker game with his cellphone then immediately set the phone down, leaving only a dark screen with audio. But they say the audio makes it clear the participants, one of whom was a 16-year-old boy, were naked and did not want to be recorded. Silva was charged with felony eavesdropping, as well as giving alcohol to a minor, child endangerment, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Witnesses say silva provided alcohol for the strip poker game. None of the participants, all camp counselors, were of legal drinking age. The recording was found after the fbi seized silva's phone last september, kcra reports. It's unclear what prompted the fbi to do that. Silva, the former ceo of the boys and girls club of stockton, has been touched by a number of controversies since 2012. \" he will clear his name, \" his lawyer tells kcra following thursday's charges.

Ultimately, the company hopes to sequence 100,000 human genomes per year.

How the discovery was made: the house committee looking into the benghazi debacle subpoenaed correspondence from longtime clinton adviser sidney blumenthal, and the state department cross-referenced the emails he handed over and the ones clinton did. It found nine emails blumenthal had were completely missing from her files, as well as parts of six others. Rep. Trey gowdy, chair of the benghazi committee, calls the findings \" significant \" and \" troubling \" and says that blumenthal was passing along \" unvetted, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated intelligence to our top diplomat \" from a source who reportedly had a financial interest in libya, reports fox news. But clinton aides say she handed over all blumenthal emails, plus a dozen more that he didn't turn in — and that there's no proof the 15 messages in question were actually sent in the form of an email, as blumenthal compiled the records he handed over into a microsoft word document, the ap reports. Officials say that while some are libya-related, the blumenthal messages to clinton don't directly deal with the 2012 benghazi attacks: instead, they discuss topics such as media reports about the death of one of moammar gadhafi's sons and the inner workings of libyan rebels. Gowdy isn't convinced the messages are moot, however. \" this has implications far beyond libya, benghazi, and our committee's work, \" he said in a statement, per cnn. \" this conclusively shows her email arrangement with herself, which was then vetted by her own lawyers, has resulted in an incomplete public record. \"",

At the least, the existence of the emails turned over by blumenthal but not by clinton directly contradicts clinton's news conference in march in which she claimed that all work emails from her personal server were turned over to the state department.

More than a third occur in india, and about half the victims are kids. Authors of the study in plos neglected tropical diseases say it's ridiculous that tens of thousands of people die annually from such an easily preventable viral disease, reports medical news today. They called for tougher rules on dog vaccinations, especially in poor regions of the world, along with more affordable vaccines for those who have been bitten, reports the bbc. The survey by the global alliance for rabies control says that sub-sahara africa has the highest death rates but that india has the most fatalities: its 21,000 deaths per year account for 35 % of all such deaths. In almost all african and asian nations, the vaccination rates for dogs fall below levels needed to keep rabies under control, says the study, which pegs the disease's annual financial toll at $ 8.6 billion. Why so many young victims? it's not complicated: \" children tend to be attracted towards dogs, \" a doctor with the rabies group tells voice of america. \" and they may not understand exactly how to behave around a dog. \" ( rabies cases are relatively rare in the us, but keep an eye out for crazy-acting raccoons. )",

        "summary": "Where voltaire, alexandre dumas, and the team behind 1998's the man in the iron mask failed, paul sonnino says he has succeeded. The history professor at uc santa barbara claims to have uncovered the true identity of the masked man who, starting in 1669, spent more than 30 years imprisoned in france's bastille and other jails, live science reports. More importantly, sonnino's new book, the search for the man in the iron mask: a historical detective story, proposes a theory for why the mystery man was incarcerated in the first place. Sonnino tells the uc santa barbara current that historians already largely agreed that the man's name was eustache dauger, and that he was a valet, rather than the twin of king louis xiv, as voltaire and dumas claimed ( and the mask, worn only occasionally, was velvet, not iron ). But the trail went cold after that. After researching the case for nearly as long as the man in the iron mask was locked up ( he died in 1703 ), sonnino has determined that dauger was the valet to cardinal mazarin, chief minister to the french king in the mid-17th century. \" mazarin had ripped off some of his huge fortune from the previous king and queen of england, \" sonnino tells the current. Some of those ill-gotten gains went to the french king. \" eustache was arrested years later just as louis xiv was trying to con their son, the present king of england, into joining him in a war. Dauger must have blabbed at the wrong time, \" he says, adding that dauger was arrested and told to hide his identity or face death. In hiding that identity, publishers weekly notes that dauger's \" identity [ was ] scrubbed from documents, \" and that he \" retains some of his mystery because of a dearth of surviving personal information. \" ( another mystery solved? \" one of the most important shipwrecks \" may have been found. )",

A 1999 report filed with the army corps of engineers warned of \" the potential for a large catastrophic failure. \" report co-author daniel miller says he's always \" known it would happen at some point. \" \" frankly, i was shocked that the county permitted any building across from the river, \" miller says, particularly after a smaller slide hit in 2006. The risk is so well-known that geologists have given the hill nicknames like \" hazel landslide, \" and residents once called it simply \" slide hill. \" for much more on the area's history of instability, see the source. Meanwhile, rescue crews are hoping to \" whittle down \" the missing list today, and officials tell fox news that they doubt all 176 are dead. But rain and fears the hill will slide more are hampering the search, usa today reports. \" it's like quicksand out there, \" the county fire chief says.",

The fire chief in stafford county says capt. James kelley and sgt. Virgil bloom, who were placed on administrative leave after the feb. 27 incident, have been reinstated, cnn reports. The chief says the firefighters ' actions had been under review because the girl was transported in a firetruck, not an ambulance.

When kelley and bloom arrived at the scene in fredericksburg, the girl, who had suffered a seizure, had turned blue and was unresponsive. The firefighters decided to use their vehicle because they thought the nearest medic was around 15 minutes away. Their reinstatement followed a nationwide outpouring of support.
