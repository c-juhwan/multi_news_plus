        "summary": "La's underground cycling scene has grown from a nocturnal pastime into an organized, competitive sport — with a few bumps along the way, la weekly reports. It started in 2004 when a small group began cycling at night for pleasure. Within two years they were a monthly, 1,000-strong horde called midnight ridazz that became \" just too much for us to handle on our own, \" says co-founder don ward. So they started a website that spawned other late-night riding groups, like ward's high-speed wolfpack hustle. But \" party rides \" like kushtown society also appeared, creating friction with other riders and police. The young, often tough guys who rode with kushtown sprayed graffiti, robbed stores, openly drank and smoked weed, and stole bikes from riders in other groups. Lapd officer gordon helper took an interest in kushtown but resisted pressure from other cops to break them up — \" because, \" he says, \" if most of these guys weren't cycling, who knows what they'd get into? \" eventually wolfpack hustle invited them for serious rides, kicked their butts, and got some into hard-core cycling. Now kushtowners are part of the city's underground, competitive scene, where cyclists vie for sponsorships and sometimes travel abroad to compete. The city cited safety concerns in stopping a huge overnight race last year, the los angeles times reports, but it sanctions other events, like wolfpack hustle's annual 1,000-foot sprint. \" it's so inspiring to see these kids now racing, \" says helper, who ran the event's megaphone. \" in fact, my dream is to see them some day in the tour de france. \"",

No, it wasn't a filibuster, but the oregon democrat was speaking out against president trump's supreme court nominee neil gorsuch, the hill reports. Merkley, a longtime opponent of gorsuch's nomination, said it's important not to allow him to fill a \" stolen seat \" on the high court, and talked about how \" ugly \" the senate had gotten over the nomination fight. When republicans last year refused to even consider then-president obama's nominee for the seat, they essentially \" decided to steal a supreme court seat, \" merkley said, per the new york times. \" such a theft never, ever has happened in the history of our nation. \" sen. Dick durbin also spoke for a bit around 6: 30am, and numerous other senators cheered merkley on via social media. But ultimately, the 15-plus-hour speech won't delay anything; senate majority leader mitch mcconnell filed cloture before merkley's speech tuesday, meaning an automatic procedural vote will go forward thursday morning. That's when democrats will stage the actual filibuster; they have enough opposing votes to block gorsuch, but republicans are then expected to exercise the \" nuclear option, \" changing the rules of the chamber in order to allow gorsuch to be confirmed on a simple majority vote. They are determined to confirm him by friday and have him on the court by late this month. ( a new wrinkle might have just cropped up for gorsuch. )",

Abdirahman sheik mohamud was indicted by a federal grand jury yesterday on charges of supporting a terrorist organization and lying to the fbi, reports the columbus dispatch. According to the indictment, the 23-year-old, who was born in somalia, left the us \" for the purpose of training and fighting with terrorists in syria \" in april last year, just weeks after he became an american citizen and received a us passport. Federal investigators say mohamud received combat and explosives training from the nusra front al-qaeda affiliate while in syria and returned to the us in june last year, days after his half-brother, who traveled to syria in 2013, was killed in combat, reports the dispatch. The indictment says the columbus resident returned to the us on the orders of a cleric who instructed him to plan an attack on a prison or military base. Mohamud, who was arrested in february, faces up to 38 years in prison if found guilty on all counts, the guardian reports.

Abdirahman sheik mohamud, 23, is accused of supporting a foreign terrorist organization and making false statements to the fbi, according to an indictment. Federal authorities said that mohamud reportedly left the us in april 2014 \"for the purpose of training and fighting with terrorists in syria \". After arriving in syria, mohamud, a naturalized us citizen who had been living in columbus, received training in shooting weapons, breaking into houses, explosives and hand-to-hand combat by jabhat al-nusra ( jan ), the al-qaida-affiliated in syria, the justice department said. Mohamud was later instructed by a cleric, identified as an affiliate of the group by a us law enforcement official, to return to the us, with intent to commit an act of terror. According to the indictment, mohamud told an unidentified person that while in syria he had received combat training. Mohamud said his instructions to return to the us came just before he was due to start fighting with militants in syria. At least 15,000 foreign jihadis have flocked to iraq and syria to participate in the twin conflicts there, according to a recent un report. Of those, dozens of americans are known to have traveled to syria, raising concerns that some could return to the us to launch attacks. Us officials have charged several people with attempting to support terrorism. Last month, federal authorities took a 17-year-old virginia high school student into custody for allegedly helping a man make his way to syria to take up arms with isis.

They placed \" rings of carbon dioxide jets \" amid rice, wheat, peas, and other crops around the world to study what happens when the air's carbon dioxide level increases from its current 400 parts per million to 500, which should happen over the next four to six decades — and found that while yields could balloon some 10 %, \" you get big plants but nothing to eat, \" one scientist not involved in the study trumpets to nbc news. That's because the plants ended up being less nutritious. In the case of wheat, zinc dropped 9 %, protein 6 %, and iron 5 %. The researcher who headed up the study theorizes that the plant's increased yield could cause those nutrients to be, as nbc news puts it, diluted. That could mean that people would need to ingest more calories from these crops to get the same amount of nutrients, or that they ' ll eat the same amount and suffer from iron and zinc deficiencies, something npr reports 2 billion people around the planet already experience. The former negatively impacts kids ' iq; the latter hampers the immune system. But researchers are working to solve the problem. They hope to create more nutrient-filled crop varieties through plant breeding; they've already succeeded with some rice and wheat varieties, though a usda researcher says doing is a formidable challenge.

Mellen called both 911 and uber after jumping out of the car and running away.

        "summary": "Ever wonder how creatures on earth grew heads? probably not, but they seem to have started with a hard plate in front of their brains. A recent study in current biology says fossils dating back hundreds of millions of years show the first signs of this plate, known as the anterior sclerite, which came with tiny eye-like sensors, smithsonian reports. It's visible in two fossils — of a squishy creature and a harder one — that show how the plate began growing before prehistoric creatures had developed a skeleton, the study says. The fossils reveal \" one of the major transitional steps between soft-bodied worm-like creatures and arthropods with hard exoskeletons and jointed limbs — this is a period of crucial transformation, \" says lead author javier ortega-hernández. Both fossils date from the cambrian period roughly 500 million years ago: the soft trilobite and weird, submarine-like odaraia alata, which had eyes on stalks and is animated in this video, reports discovery. The study also spotted an anterior sclerite in the fossil of another cambrian creature, the anomalocaridid, which shared an ancestor with the odaraia alata. The hard plate likely fused into parts of the modern head over time, the study says, as these animals evolved from soft to hard and became today's spiders, crustaceans, and insects, eureka alert reports. \" heads have become more complex over time, \" says ortega-hernández. His study \" gives us an improved understanding of the origins and complex evolutionary history of this highly successful group. \" ( read about chicken embryos grown with dinosaur snouts. )",

            "Morphology: much of the body of odaraia is contained within a prominent bivalved carapace that, unusually, has its hinge line along the dorsal midline of the animal with the valves meeting on the ventral surface. The carapace forms a tube open at the front and back. The head protrudes from the front of this carapace tube, and consists of a small anterior plate, or sclerite, that bears a pair of large, spherical eyes on short stalks. On the head between the two large eyes are three small, highly reflective spots that have been interpreted as median eyes. Behind the head, the body consisted of approximately 47 narrow segments, each bearing a pair of appendages. The appendages on the first two body segments are thin, segmented walking branches, but all appendages behind this are segmented and branch into two ( biramous ). These biramous appendages have a segmented inner branch that has a large spine at its base and splits into two walking branches distally, and an outer branch with filamentous blades. The tail or telson has three blades or flukes, two of which extend laterally and the third of which extends vertically. The gut is typically straight and has paired midgut glands. Abundance: odaraia typically makes up less than 0.5 % of the community in walcott quarry, from which over 200 specimens have been collected",
            "A new study from the university of cambridge has identified one of the oldest fossil brains ever discovered - more than 500 million years old - and used it to help determine how heads first evolved in early animals. The results, published today ( 7 may ) in the journal current biology, identify a key point in the evolutionary transition from soft to hard bodies in early ancestors of arthropods, the group that contains modern insects, crustaceans and spiders. The study looked at two types of arthropod ancestors - a soft-bodied trilobite and a bizarre creature resembling a submarine. It found that a hard plate, called the anterior sclerite, and eye-like features at the front of their bodies were connected through nerve traces originating from the front part of the brain, which corresponds with how vision is controlled in modern arthropods. The new results also allowed new comparisons with anomalocaridids, a group of large swimming predators of the period, and found key similarities between the anterior sclerite and a plate on the top of the anomalocaridid head, suggesting that they had a common origin. Although it is widely agreed that anomalocaridids are early arthropod ancestors, their bodies are actually quite different. Thanks to the preserved brains in these fossils, it is now possible to recognise the anterior sclerite as a bridge between the head of anomalocaridids and that of more familiar jointed"

Although it is widely agreed that anomalocaridids are early arthropod ancestors, their bodies are actually quite different. Thanks to the preserved brains in these fossils, it is now possible to recognise the anterior sclerite as a bridge between the head of anomalocaridids and that of more familiar jointed"

Army lt. Gen. Jeffrey buchanan, who is overseeing the deployment, tells politico that some of the 5,800 troops sent to the border will be departing in the coming days because they have already completed their missions, including \" hardening \" the border with concertina wire and barricades. He says all the troops should be home for christmas, since the \" end date right now is 15 december, and i've got no indications from anybody that we ' ll go beyond that. \" the news that troops are going to be withdrawn — and trump's relative silence on the issue since the midterm elections — led some critics to accuse the president of exaggerating the threat and misusing the military to influence the elections, the guardian reports. Sources tell cnn that trump is expected to change the rules governing use of force on the border mission to allow troops to use \" proportional \" force to protect customs and border protection officials if migrants become violent. Some 2,000 migrants have arrived in tijuana in recent days and authorities believe around 3,000 more have arrived in the border city of mexicali.

Someone had figured out that a glitch prevented citibank from recording the extra withdrawals, reports patch.com. With the money, the suspects would then go on gambling sprees, usually getting rewarded with comped rooms by the casinos because of the amount of money they were flashing.

The turtle is the first-known example of biofluorescence in reptiles. The ability to reflect blue light from the ocean and reflect it back as a different color has previously been seen in coral, fish, sharks, and more. And previously only coral was known to glow in more than one color, according to the christian science monitor. Gruber was attempting to film biofluorescence in sharks and coral in the solomon islands in july when the glowing turtle \" came out of nowhere, \" national geographic reports. \"i followed it for a few minutes, and then it dove down a deep coral wall, \" gruber tells abc news. \" i decided to leave it alone as it had already divulged its secret. \" gruber, who found more examples of biofluorescence in local captive hawksbills, isn't sure why these sea turtles glow or if hawksbills elsewhere do, too. They're one of the rarest species on the planet, having been hunted nearly to extinction to make tortoiseshell products, and that makes them hard to study, according to the monitor.",

Many sea creatures have shown the ability to show single colors but this turtle is one of the first organisms to show two, gruber said, adding that so far only corals have shown two colors. \"biofluorescence was first intensively studied in corals, \" gruber said. \"scientists were surprised last year to find it widespread in fish and sharks, where we hypothesized it to be a potential ' covert ' means of communication. \" gruber added that a few weeks ago scientists found evidence of this phenomenon being a \"prey attractant, \" meaning it can have functional significance among marine life.",

        "summary": "A harmless symbol of christmas cheer was once deemed so risky that the fda had to regulate it. Tinsel once contained lead, which, as scientists realized in the 1960s, made it dangerous to kids. That prompted a deal between the fda and tinsel makers to alter manufacturing methods, the american chemical society reports in a video. The 1972 change was at first kept secret, popular science reports, for fear \" that many people preferring the lead variety would stockpile it, \" an official said at the time. Believe it or not, that wasn't the first time tinsel had posed a threat: one reason lead was used is that some kinds of tinsel used to be flammable. The flammable products came into use amid metal shortages during world war i. Before that, aluminum and copper were often used to make tinsel. These days, it's usually made of plastic, coated with a metal like aluminum. In case you were wondering, our word \" tinsel \" is derived from the old french for sparkle, \" estincele, \" and the american version of the holiday tradition likely comes from a german custom of putting silver on a christmas tree to reflect candle lights. As one maker tells chemical &amp; engineering news, tinsel has been quite popular following the great recession as an inexpensive decoration method. ( there's a good chance your holiday decorations came from this chinese town. )",

To the millennial consumer, it's a face they've seen on every bucket of kfc chicken they've ever been served, but they simultaneously have less connection with the idea of the man behind the logo. Because yes, for the record — colonel harland david sanders was indeed a real human being, for those who need the clarification. He was born in 1890 indiana, and was made an honorary kentucky colonel ( the most awesome state-based title one can have bestowed upon them ) in 1935 by governor ruby laffoon, five years before he finalized and began selling the \"secret recipe \" for what would become kfc. A savvy businessman with an innate understanding of how franchising could make him rich, sanders built his chicken empire into a national force by the 1960s, before cashing out in 1964 and into semi-retirement. However, that was hardly the end of \"the colonel \" as a pop culture figure. In reality, the terms of his buyout of the company stated that sanders would continue to appear as the product's mascot in perpetuity,",

Torchlight on the walls would no doubt heighten the sense of animation, the researchers say. They also found toy disks that — when rotated in looped strands of animal tendon — quickly alternate images of animals sitting and standing. It's the same principle that inspired the thaumatrope, a device that led to movie cameras and animation. Hat tip to rawstory for the link.",

            "Study finds stone age artists were the first animators by muriel kane sunday, june 3, 2012 17: 48 edt a french archaeologist and an artist who have studied stone age cave art for twenty years say that many of the drawings were intended to produce an illusion of movement. According to marc azéma and florent rivère, viewing the scenes by flickering torchlight would have been just one of the methods employed to create a sense of animation in the figures, which date back as much as 30,000 years. Another popular technique can be seen in an image of a \"eight-legged \" bison at chauvet cave, which is actually two superimposed images in slightly different stances. Azéma and rivère say they have found 53 figures in twelve different caves that use this technique to represent animals running, tossing their heads, or shaking their tails. An even more impressive example is the use of stone or bone disks with engravings of a sitting and standing animal on opposite sides, which may have served as a prehistoric version of the 19th century toy known as a thaumatrope. If a strand of animal tendon run through a hole in the center of the disk was twisted and then rapidly untwisted, it would make the disk spin so fast that the two images would merge into an animation of the animal changing position. Finally, the two investigators believe that some of the cave walls, like one in chauvet that appears to show a pride of lions stalking mammoths and bison, may have been intended to be read as sequential narratives, like prehistoric comic strips. Azéma and rivère have been conducting their research on paleolithic animation techniques for the past two decades, but much of their work has been available only in french. A paper in the june issue of antiquity is the first summary of their results for an english-speaking audience.

        "summary": "The benefits of breastfeeding extend long beyond childhood, a decades-long study finds. Researchers have been keeping tabs on a group of brazilian children since 1982, and recently, they checked in with some 3,500 of them to see how they're doing as adults. Interviews and an iq test found that those who breastfed had higher iqs and were earning more money, the guardian reports. In fact, a longer period of breastfeeding was associated with particularly good results: those babies who had breastfed for a year ended up pulling in about $ 100 more per month as adults than did those who had breastfed for less than a month. They also had iqs that surpassed the shorter-term breastfeeders by four points. The researchers used data from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, the guardian notes, and they worked to control for factors like maternal education, babies ' birth weight, mothers'smoking, and more. Still, the scientists say that other influences could be at play, and the lead researcher tells the new york times that he doesn't \" want to terrify people who did not breastfeed or who breastfed for a short time. \" in fact, another recent study questions the idea that iq and breastfeeding are linked: a researcher in the netherlands tells medicalresearch.com that other variables — including \" sociodemographic factors, parental lifestyle, and, most importantly, maternal iq \" may explain the connection. Still, she agrees that \" breastfeeding is important for overall optimum growth of children. \" ( a lactation expert recently explained why pumping and breastfeeding aren't equivalent. )",

        "summary": "China ranks as one of the least honest countries and the uk as one of the most, if a new study out of the university of east anglia in the uk holds any weight. Presenting their findings at the london experimental workshop this week, researchers say they analyzed more than 1,500 people, roughly 100 from each of 15 countries, as they took two tests in which cheating was financially incentivized. It turns out that overall, there was \" significant evidence \" of lying in all countries, the lead researcher says, but the levels vary widely. Those in china appeared most likely to cheat on a coin toss test ( those in the uk were least likely ), in which they were paid $ 3 to $ 5 for every head they flipped and were thus spotted cheating if they reported too many ( as smithsonian notes in an unrelated article, a coin should come up heads nearly 50 % of the time ). Those in turkey, meanwhile, were most likely to cheat on a challenging six-question music quiz ( this time japan and then the uk came in as least likely to cheat ), where half the answers were virtually impossible to get right without looking online, which they were asked not to do. As for the us, we were the eighth most honest country on the coin flip, and the third on the music quiz — though perhaps more of us happen to know lady gaga's first name and michael jackson's birthplace, which were deemed two of the \" very difficult \" questions. The study found people are guilty of projecting as well, reports pacific standard, with the least honest among us the most likely to think others cheat more than they actually do. A press release notes that, \" surprisingly, \" people also thought less of the honesty of their compatriots than of the honesty of those in other countries.

            "Research from the university of east anglia has found that people's honesty varies significantly between countries. It also suggests that honesty is less important to a country's current economic growth than during earlier periods in history. The study examined whether people from different countries were more or less honest and how this related to a country's economic development. More than 1500 participants from 15 countries took part in an online survey involving two incentivised experiments, designed to measure honest behaviour. Firstly, they were asked to flip a coin and state whether it landed on 'heads ' or 'tails '. They knew if they reported that it landed on heads, they would be rewarded with $ 3 or $ 5. If the proportion reporting heads was more than 50 per cent in a given country, this indicated that people were being dishonest. The same participants were then asked to complete a music quiz where they were again rewarded financially if they answered all questions correctly. They were asked not to search for the answers on the internet, and had to tick a box confirming they had answered on their own before moving on to the next question. Three of the questions were deliberately difficult so it would be highly likely that participants would need to look up the answer - getting more than one of these questions right indicated cheating. Data from the tests was compared to estimate whether people from particular countries were more likely to tell the truth.

        "summary": "Utah makes it sound so easy: solve the state's chronic homeless problem by just putting them in homes. That's the goal of utah's housing first initiative, a program that has since 2005 cut the number of chronically homeless down from 1,932 individuals to a mere 178 — a 91 % drop across utah, nbc news reports. \" we know them by name, who they are, and what their needs are, \" says gordon walker, director of a state community and housing division. \" you put them in housing first … and then help them begin to deal with the issues that caused them to be homeless, \" the director of utah's homeless task force adds. More than 2,200 people have been the recipients of new abodes through the initiative so far, per walker. Chronic homelessness is defined as being out on the street for more than a year, or three times in four years, the ap notes. Before utah jump-started its program in 2005, about 14 % of the state's homeless population fit the \" chronic \" label, but that segment used up 58 % of resources, deseret news reports. While state officials acknowledge the program won't completely end homelessness, the \" slice \" they're starting with seems to be paying off: not only is it pulling people off the streets, but it's subsequently opening up space at shelters for the temporarily homeless; plus, 80 % of those placed in homes remain in them, walker says.

        "summary": "Apparently taking a cue from captain james. T. Kirk himself, one california politician is looking into the possibility of shipping 9 billion gallons of water from alaska to the increasingly dry state, usa today reports. Rep. Janice hahn held an exploratory meeting last week with terry trapp, the ceo of alaska bulk water. Trapp's company has water rights to blue lake in sitka, alaska, and he wants to use tanker ships to get that water to california, which is in the fourth year of a serious drought. The daily breeze reports trapp believes his company is part of the solution, though hahn isn't quite so sold. \" i think it was an opportunity to think outside the box, \" she said following the meeting. The major hurdle is cost. Usa today reports trapp wants 6 cents per gallon — or 12 times what california currently pays for its water. That brings the total to $ 540 million per year for enough water for only 70,000 of california's 12 million families. If that seems a little steep, hahn agrees, even with trapp upselling his product as \" some of the most pure water on earth. \" according to the breeze, this is a family passion for hahn, whose father talked about a water pipeline from alaska when he was in california politics in the 1980s. He wasn't alone. The juneau empire reports former alaska governor wally hickel proposed such a pipeline around the same time, though his plan was \" widely ridiculed. \"",

Twitter and other social media gave viewers the chance to skip the pundits'take and jump right into the post-debate analysis themselves, the new york times notes. Mitt romney's willingness to defund big bird, romney's energy, and obama's lack thereof all prompted flurries of tweets. Tweets per minute, politico notes in a chart, peaked with jim lehrer's suggestion to romney regarding further discussion of a point: \" let's not. \" but when there's so much activity in the twitterverse, it becomes a \" relentless gush of information that can outgrow its usefulness by being too overwhelming to consume, \" writes patrick gavin at politico. Still, a few highlights ( and lowlights ): kitchen aid managed to squeeze in a less-than-tasteful joke about obama's dead grandmother, gawker notes. Following her mention onstage, the company tweeted: \" obamas gma even knew it was going 2 b bad! she died 3 days b4 he became president. \" the company quickly apologized. Scientist neil degrasse tyson defended big bird and co. In 140 or less: \" cutting pbs support ( 0.012 % of the budget ) to help balance the federal budget is like deleting text files to make room on your 500gig hard drive. \" big bird got several twitter accounts of his own, abc news reports, offering trenchant commentary: \" under mitt #romney, cookie monster won't receive the care he needs to overcome his addiction, \" noted @bigbirdromney. \" i guess i ' m the 47 % … \" wrote @bigbird.

President barack obama and former massachusetts gov. Mitt romney faced off in their first debate before the presidential election next month. And it wasn't just a big night for the two candidates. It also was a big night for the likes of facebook, twitter and google+. While social networks played a role in the 2008 presidential election, they've taken an even bigger part this year. That's not surprising since, for instance, facebook had 100 million monthly users in 2008 and today it has 955 million. Using social networks is an effective way to send a single message out to potentially millions of eyeballs. Twitter played a starring role during the debate, which was the most tweeted",
            "Presidential debates are customarily scored and picked apart the instant the moderator says \"good night \" at 10: 30 p.m. But the web is speeding up time. When the first of this season's debates started on wednesday in denver, the scoring began at 9: 01 p.m., as soon as jim lehrer, the moderator, said \"good evening. \" mr. Lehrer's open-ended questions, mitt romney's plan to end the federal subsidy for pbs and mr. Romney's high energy level — against president obama's comparatively low energy level — all received spikes of attention from viewers who were chatting online along with the debate. The instant feedback helped harden conventional wisdom that mr. Obama had turned in a weak performance, even before he had finished speaking. On msnbc, liberal hosts like ed schultz were taken aback",
            "Image credit: mark lennihan/ap photo while president obama and mitt romney were trying to tout their economic plans, the social media sphere was massively distracted by a big yellow bird - big bird that is. After romney said, \" i love big bird, \" but that he plans to cut funding for pbs anyhow, social media exploded with tweets about the \" sesame street \" character. According to twitter data, the words \" big bird \" were tweeted 17,000 times per minute and \" pbs, \" the channel that airs \" sesame street, \" peaked at 10,000 tweets per minute. \" big bird \" was also the fourth highest-rising search term on google. Romney's comment sparked the hashtag #savebigbird, which was trending worldwide, and spawned at least three pro-big bird twitter handles, @bigbird, @bigbirdromney and @firedbigbird."

That's not surprising since, for instance, facebook had 100 million monthly users in 2008 and today it has 955 million. Using social networks is an effective way to send a single message out to potentially millions of eyeballs. Twitter played a starring role during the debate, which was the most tweeted",
            "Presidential debates are customarily scored and picked apart the instant the moderator says \"good night \" at 10: 30 p.m. But the web is speeding up time. When the first of this season's debates started on wednesday in denver, the scoring began at 9: 01 p.m., as soon as jim lehrer, the moderator, said \"good evening. \" mr. Lehrer's open-ended questions, mitt romney's plan to end the federal subsidy for pbs and mr. Romney's high energy level — against president obama's comparatively low energy level — all received spikes of attention from viewers who were chatting online along with the debate. The instant feedback helped harden conventional wisdom that mr. Obama had turned in a weak performance, even before he had finished speaking. On msnbc, liberal hosts like ed schultz were taken aback",
            "Image credit: mark lennihan/ap photo while president obama and mitt romney were trying to tout their economic plans, the social media sphere was massively distracted by a big yellow bird - big bird that is. After romney said, \" i love big bird, \" but that he plans to cut funding for pbs anyhow, social media exploded with tweets about the \" sesame street \" character. According to twitter data, the words \" big bird \" were tweeted 17,000 times per minute and \" pbs, \" the channel that airs \" sesame street, \" peaked at 10,000 tweets per minute. \" big bird \" was also the fourth highest-rising search term on google. Romney's comment sparked the hashtag #savebigbird, which was trending worldwide, and spawned at least three pro-big bird twitter handles, @bigbird, @bigbirdromney and @firedbigbird.",

The bbc notes it's a sensitive situation for the country, which was accused of not going the distance last year when it came to saving journalist kenji goto and haruna yukawa, who were beheaded by isis early last year.

        "summary": "In 1968, 36-year-old donald crowhurst set off from england to sail around the world as part of a competition. Crowhurst had his hopes set on using the resulting prize money to save his failing business, but he really had no business being in the race given that neither he nor his boat were equipped for such a journey. If you're expecting a miracle ending, forget it. As a feature at sportsnet explains, crowhurst didn't even come close. That is not, however, what his family and the rest of the world initially thought because crowhurst began reporting false positions via radio and keeping a fake log book. ( at one point, he claimed 243 miles in a single day, which made headlines as a solo sailing record. ) while the other competitors were actually sailing around the world, crowhurst made it as far as south america and then turned back for home. He would never make it. In july 1969, a royal mail ship found his boat drifting in the atlantic. Crowhurst was nowhere to be found, but he left behind notes that admitted his hoax, and his tale became front-page news across britain. His rambling, metaphysical writing also suggested that crowhurst had begun losing his mind, perhaps because he was overwhelmed by the desperation of his plight, the guilt, the loneliness at sea, or all of above. The story includes interviews with his widow, who thinks her husband fell overboard accidentally, and his son. \" i don't think at first it was a grand scheme, \" says the latter, theorizing that his father began fudging his records to save face when the journey began turning bad, only to see the hoax spiral out of control thanks to global attention to his trip.

His family was staying in a hotel in teignmouth, on the southern toe of england, because tomorrow his father, donald, was setting off to sail around the world. But as simon listened to the weather rage, the excitement he'd felt over his father becoming a real-life adventure hero collapsed. He had seen his father's spindly 12-metre boat, and for the first time, it occurred to him that this voyage was dangerous. Simon was terrified. In a nearby room, donald crowhurst's confidence was crumbling into tearful panic as he confessed to his wife, clare, that his boat wasn't ready. Only later would it occur to her that he may have been begging her to tell him not to go, to give him a way out. The thought would haunt her. But at the time, even with her normally ebullient husband sobbing in front of her, she still believed he could do anything and didn't want him to regret giving up.

He was asked to leave the family's home over two years ago after pulling a gun on the family. Cnn has background on the bizarre case: on oct. 3, hogs told his wife he had a surprise for her, and they drove from their home in alabama to kentucky, west virginia, virginia, maryland, charlotte, north carolina, tennessee, and ultimately georgia, where they arrived on oct. 6. His wife left at that point, calling family members to pick her up and return her home. The following day, hogs arrived at his grandmother's home in florida, and asked her about rebecca's family. The following morning, saturday, rebecca's 16-year-old sister discovered she was missing. It's not clear how hogs allegedly abducted rebecca, but it happened before 9: 30am and he took her to a nearby mcdonald's for breakfast. They were next spotted saturday night at a georgia gas station and then sunday night in tennessee. A ranger encountered the pair at a state park in tennessee sunday night, but since an amber alert had not yet been issued in that state, he didn't realize until it was too late that the girl had been abducted.",

The gervais school district board voted unanimously last month to make condoms available to students from grade six on up, the la times reports. Students will have to ask for the birth control specifically, however, and have a talk with a counselor, teacher, or administrator first. The plan sounds less extreme when you realize that the tiny district basically treats its middle and high schools as one establishment, and hence put the same rules in place for both. A survey last spring found that 42 % of the high school's students \" never \" or \" sometimes \" use protection, and officials tell the statesman journal that nine students became pregnant last year. Still, some parents are uneasy about the plan. \" i don't know how to feel, \" one told kgw. \" somebody talking to my children and giving them a condom, at that age, i don't know. \"",

        "summary": "A little girl in canada saved her mom and her brother by taking extraordinary action after a car accident in june, the cbc reports. Lexi shymanski, 5, was strapped into the back seat beside her baby brother when their mom, angela — soothed by a lullaby cd playing for the kids — dozed off behind the wheel and plunged their suv down a 40-foot embankment near jasper, alberta. That's when lexi woke up with her mom unconscious and her 10-week-old brother peter crying. \" it's crazy, \" angela tells metro news. \" i only can remember one or two times where she got out of her five-point harness previously. She somehow got out, adrenaline or whatever, and barefoot hiked up the embankment. \" not only that, lexi flagged down a passerby who then flagged down another driver — a paramedic, as luck would have it — who hiked down and helped lexi's family members until emergency crews arrived. It could have been a very different ending: angela says she ended up driving a different route than she had told her husband she was taking, and said the crashed car couldn't be seen from the highway. All were flown to a hospital in edmonton, where lexi's injuries appeared light and peter was operated on for bleeding of the brain that's expected to heal. Angela, however, had fractures to her neck and upper back: \" the spleen had to be taken out and my liver was really badly damaged but they took all my organs out to check for rips and tears, \" she tells the prince george citizen. She's still recovering in a wheelchair ( with help from her husband, travis ) and struggles to walk with nerve damage to her left leg. As for lexi, she's doing ok but complains of neck pain and nightmares. Asked how she managed the rescue, she says, \" i thought, ' what would mommy say if she was awake... Mommy would say go get help. ' \" see a gofundme account for the shymanskis, or read about how a teen's nosebleed saved her parents. )",

Phelps is among those to take part in the ancient chinese medicinal practice known as \" cupping therapy, \" featured in his own under armour ad.

            "As the federal government shuts down for the first time in nearly two decades, republicans have a resonant message to share with the american people. Democrats must now defend subsidies within the affordable care act for their well-compensated staffers, an onerous medical device tax, and the reviled individual mandate. The gop has robbed the democrats of a winning issue, the notion that the aca should not be wholly defunded through a budget process. The problem for the gop is that they settled on this message late last night when a shutdown had already become unavoidable. For the last week, the gop's message has been muddled. The average american is probably unable to tell you precisely what the republican position is today and how it differs much from their position yesterday. Congressional democrats, by contrast, have had a unified and unwavering message which is easily digested by the apolitical public: no changes to the aca. Period. While the polls indicate that the public is deeply mistrustful of \"obamacare, \" surveys also clearly show that the public does not favor republicans taking advantage of budgetary fights in congress to reform aspects of the aca.

Now research out of the andean highlands of south america suggests the humans who braved such conditions more than 7,000 years ago did so in an impressive manner — year-round. As a press release explains, prior research established the presence of hunter-gatherers in the higher elevations of southern peru as many as 9,000 years ago, but there was much debate over whether their occupation was seasonal or permanent. A team led by university of wyoming researchers set out to answer the question by excavating a peruvian site 12,500 feet above sea level. That's more than twice as high as denver, notes usa today, and so high that lead researcher randy haas says he's seen people faint after deplaning at the regional airport there. The team uncovered the remains of 16 people along with some 80,000 artifacts and then looked at these factors: oxygen and carbon isotopes in the human bones, the demographics of those bones, the travel distance to low-elevation zones, and the makeup of the uncovered tools. The results constitute the \" strongest empirical support to date for permanent occupation \" there, per the study, published in the royal society open science: the bones revealed low oxygen and high carbon isotope values, \" revealing the distinct signature \" of permanent occupation; the travel time to a low-elevation zone was too long to be undertaken seasonally; that women and children were part of the group made a low-elevation migration even unlikelier; and their tools were almost exclusively made with stones found at high-elevations.",

            "Using five different scientific approaches, a team including university of wyoming researchers has given considerable support to the idea that humans lived year-round in the andean highlands of south america over 7,000 years ago. Examining human remains and other archaeological evidence from a site at nearly 12,500 feet above sea level in peru, the scientists show that intrepid hunter-gatherers -- men, women and children -- managed to survive at high elevation before the advent of agriculture, in spite of lack of oxygen, frigid temperatures and exposure to elements. \" this gives us a very strong baseline to help understand the rates of cultural and genetic change in the andean highlands, a region known for the domestication of alpaca, potatoes and other plants; emergence of state-level political and economic complexity; and rapid human adaptation to high-elevation life, \" says randy haas, a postdoctoral research associate in the university of wyoming's department of anthropology and the team's leader.

Examining human remains and other archaeological evidence from a site at nearly 12,500 feet above sea level in peru, the scientists show that intrepid hunter-gatherers -- men, women and children -- managed to survive at high elevation before the advent of agriculture, in spite of lack of oxygen, frigid temperatures and exposure to elements. \" this gives us a very strong baseline to help understand the rates of cultural and genetic change in the andean highlands, a region known for the domestication of alpaca, potatoes and other plants; emergence of state-level political and economic complexity; and rapid human adaptation to high-elevation life, \" says randy haas, a postdoctoral research associate in the university of wyoming's department of anthropology and the team's leader.

Authorities are still searching for the gunman, who was dressed as santa claus as he killed 39 people just over an hour into 2017. According to reports in a turkish newspaper, investigators believe the suspect is from uzbekistan or kyrgyzstan. In other developments: al jazeera reports that out of the 38 victims identified from the attack on the upscale reina club, at least 25 were foreigners. There were victims from belgium, canada, france, india, iraq, israel, jordan, lebanon, libya, saudi arabia, and tunisia, along with 11 turkish citizens and a woman who held dual turkish-belgian nationality. At least one us citizen is among the 70 injured. The new york times has profiles of some of the victims, including bollywood producer abis rizvi. Nbc reports that chilling security footage of the attack and its aftermath has appeared on social media. In one video, chaos can be seen unfolding outside the club as the gunman appears to shoot his way in. Authorities say the attacker killed a policeman and a civilian outside before entering the club. The bbc reports that the attack lasted just seven minutes. From what investigators can piece together, the attacker arrived in a taxi and started shooting at people randomly after entering the club. He dropped his gun and removed his overcoat before he fled. Investigators suspect that the attack was carried out by the same isis cell that attacked istanbul's ataturk airport in june, killing 45, the guardian reports. The ap reports that turkish officials say 147 people suspected of isis links have been arrested over the last week, and turkey and russia have hit more than 100 isis targets in separate operations in syria.",

Per the study published in the lancet, 24 ms patients between the ages of 18 and 50 from three different canadian hospitals were subjected to \" strong immunosuppression \" treatments, including aggressive chemo, followed up by a stem cell transplant. All of the patients had a poor prognosis and had already tried similar but more conservative ms treatments — but this treatment plan went beyond those, completely wiping out the immune system instead of merely suppressing it, then rebuilding it from scratch with stem cells. The results: the treatments significantly reduced the onset of the disease for 23 out of the 24 patients ( one of the patients died ). And among the survivors, no one suffered a relapse or showed any sign of the disease over a 13-year period. Per the telegraph, patients who had been severely disabled could now walk and move about again, even go skiing — leading experts to rave that the \" unprecedented \" treatment is \" close to curative \" and could be hailed as the first ever to lead to \" complete long-term remission. \" medical daily notes that the treatment may have been effective because it basically treated multiple sclerosis as an autoimmune disease rather than a neurodegenerative one — an ongoing debate between scientists. But while the head of clinical trials for the uk's ms society says this type of treatment \" holds a lot of promise \" for ms patients, \" it's also an aggressive procedure that comes with substantial risks and requires specialist aftercare. \" and in addition to the tiny number of subjects examined in the study, there was also no control group — meaning larger, more fleshed-out studies are needed to see if these findings hold real weight.

            "Multiple sclerosis ( ms ) involves an immune-mediated process in which an abnormal response of the body's immune system is directed against the central nervous system ( cns ). The cns is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. When myelin or nerve fibers are damaged or destroyed in ms, messages within the cns are altered or stopped completely. Damage to areas of the cns may produce a variety of neurological symptoms that will vary among people with ms in type and severity the damaged areas develop scar tissue which gives the disease its name – multiple areas of scarring or multiple sclerosis. The cause of ms is not known, but it is believed to involve genetic susceptibility, abnormalities in the immune system and environmental factors that combine to trigger the disease. People with ms typically experience one of four disease courses. There are over a dozen treatments to help modify the ms disease process. Within the cns, the immune system causes inflammation that damages myelin — the fatty substance that surrounds and insulates the nerve fibers — as well as the nerve fibers themselves, and the specialized cells that make myelin."

A round-up of coverage: afghanistan vet sean foertsch, who works with wounded troops, tells the military times that trump's remarks weren't terrible, but he used \" bad vocabulary. \" \" if we want to destigmatize ptsd, we need to get beyond strength and weakness, \" he said. Paul rieckhoff, ceo and founder of iraq and afghanistan veterans of america, tweeted that \" every national leader has responsibility to use accurate and appropriate language when talking about mental health \" and called for a national dialogue on the issue. Mashable notes that marine staff sergeant chad robichaux, who asked trump the question that prompted the comments, says \" it's sickening that anyone would twist mr. Trump's comments to me in order to pursue a political agenda, \" he said in a statement. \" i took his comments to be thoughtful and understanding of the struggles many veterans have, and i believe he is committed to helping them. \" trump adviser lt. Gen. Michael flynn accused the media of taking words out of context \" in order to deceive voters and veterans \" and many vets commenting online agreed with him, reports the washington post. The hill reports that joe biden tore into trump during a campaign stop for hillary clinton in florida. \" i don't think he was trying to be mean. He is just so thoroughly, completely uninformed, \" said biden. He said to \" care for those we send to war and to care for them and their family when they come home \" is a \" sacred obligation \" for the us. \" what are the chances trump honors commitment to those who are wounded? \" biden asked. \" it's not just that he doesn't get it.

Police say the infant ( somehow ) was among about 30 adults who pelted officers and gas company officials with rocks — hence the attempted murder charges — when they went after gas thieves in lahore. But the baby's grandfather says the charges against everyone, not just the child, are trumped up.

Inspector kashif muhammad, who attended the alleged crime scene and has since been suspended, wrote in his report that it was a case of attempted murder. Appearing in a packed court room with others accused in the case on thursday, musa was seen crying as his grandfather muhammad yasin held him on his shoulder. Yasin later fed him milk from a bottle while fielding questions from reporters. \" everyone in the",
            "Lahore how far police inefficiency and malice can go in pakistan sometimes is hard to guess, as it nominated a nine-month-old infant as one of the accused of planning a murder, threatening a police team and interfering in state affairs. The interesting yet shocking development in how police works was unveiled on thursday as an additional district and sessions judge, rafaqat ali qamar, granted post-arrest bail to a nine-month old infant, muhammad mosa, on charges of planning the murder, threatening of a police team and interfering in state affairs. The court granted bail to the accused on submission of surety bonds of rs. 50000 and summoned police in this regard by april 12. The 'accused ' appeared before the said court while he was sitting in lap of his father, ami. The judge while seeing the minor showed his disappointment over the attitude and performance of police and, in no time, confirmed"

        "summary": "Many americans love using gun ranges, and thousands have gotten sick because of it. In an ongoing investigation called \" loaded with lead, \" the seattle times reports that \" reckless \" range owners often fail to clean and ventilate shooting areas plagued by lead dust and vapor. The result: a legacy of americans sickened with lead poisoning, including family members contaminated by lead that shooters tracked home ( in fact, national statistics show that lead poisoning from shooting guns is the main cause of lead poisoning off the job ). Ensuing health issues include nausea, fatigue, mental problems, and damaged organs. One range master says his teeth fell out, and a new hampshire police sergeant died from lead absorbed at a firing range. \" i ' m beat, i ' m going to bed. Goodnight, \" he told his wife one day, and was dead in bed the next morning. Warnings about poisoning at indoor gun ranges date back to the 1960s, yet state and federal regulators rarely test police ranges. When they did in baltimore and washington state, and found them dangerous, cleaning policies weren't fully overhauled. Other gun-range users have suffered, too — like the 20 youths in a washington state gun club who tested positive for lead exposure ( and children are more vulnerable due to their developing brains, nbc news notes ). Now police in kirkland, wash., say they have a solution: a $ 1.3 million gun range that uses lead-free ammunition. \" the big elephant in the room is probably the cost, because it does cost more, \" says a kirkland sergeant of copper ammunition. \" but in the long run, it ends up paying for itself. \" delve into the times ' probe, which is in four parts ( one, two, three, and four. )",

The verge brings the news, citing broadcast now, but notes that the series probably won't debut anytime soon: io9 got a peek at the casting sheets and scripts last week, and it appears work on the project is in its beginning stages. Netflix is starting its own original content push this year, with house of cards on feb. 1 and arrested development later. When it does arrive, charlie jane anders at io9 thinks the show \" looks quite promising. \" the characters and humor seem to be in keeping with the movie, but the relationships between the main four ( tallahassee, columbus, wichita, and little rock, for whom there are currently casting calls ) \" will probably become a bit sweeter and more like a family as the show goes on. \"",

That's the ruling of a us district court in pennsylvania in a joint lawsuit covering two cases in philadelphia, the phillyvoice reports. The complaint — which the aclu of pennsylvania says is the fourth suit in a series designed to curb the philly pd's \" illegal practice of arresting citizens in retaliation for observing or recording the police performing their duties \" — is in the names of amanda geraci and richard fields, who sued the city for infringing on their first amendment and fourth amendment rights. In the case of geraci, ided by the aba journal as a \" trained legal observer, \" she was at a 2012 fracking protest and says she was physically restrained and prevented from recording an arrest. Fields says he was handcuffed, put in a police van, and stripped of his cellphone and searched after he recorded what he thought was a \" great picture \" of 20 cops outside a 2013 temple university house party. The district court on friday did allow the plaintiffs ' fourth amendment claims regarding excessive force ( geraci ) and false arrest and unreasonable search ( fields ). Their first amendment rights were another story, with the court deciding citizens can't record police actions unless they engage in what's called \" expressive conduct \" — they tell the cops why they want to capture certain images or moments, per the aba journal. \" absent any authority from the supreme court or our court of appeals, we decline to create a new first amendment right for citizens to photograph officers when they have no expressive purpose such as challenging police actions, \" the decision reads. Eugene volokh takes issue in the washington post with the ruling, noting precedents set in lower federal courts for this type of recording and that what geraci and fields were doing was silently \" gathering \" information, which he says is as constitutional as \" loud \" gathering of information. An appeal is reportedly in the works, volokh says. ( video got this professor fired. )",

Over a period of 12 months, researchers recorded each couple's time-to-pregnancy and observed that by five to six months into the study, the couples who had yet to conceive were those with the highest levels of chronic stress. \"when we get to couples starting to have problems [ conceiving ], stress levels really seem to differ from those who get pregnant [ quickly ], \" lead study author courtney lynch, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the ohio state university wexner medical center told foxnews.com to study stress levels, lynch and her team collected saliva samples from the women at the beginning of the study and after the",

Women who had high levels of a biomarker for stress in their saliva took 29 percent longer to become pregnant, compared to those with lower levels, a study published monday in the journal human reproduction found. And those with high levels of the stress indicator were also twice as likely as others to meet the clinical definition for infertility — having unprotected sex for 12 months without becoming pregnant — by the end of the study.

Researchers found that women who had higher levels of an enzyme in their saliva called alpha-amylase, an indicator of stress, took longer to conceive. The study is the first to show a link between infertility in women and stress levels measured in saliva. \" we showed that women who had the highest levels of alpha-amylase were more than twice as likely to not become pregnant after 12 months as women who had the lowest amounts, \" said study author courtney lynch, a reproductive epidemiologist at the ohio state university college of medicine.

But kyl only committed to serve until jan. 3, 2019, the end of the current congress, and there have been calls for ducey to appoint mcsally to replace him if he chooses not to continue until a 2020 special election, abc news reports. Kyl, 76, told cnn on tuesday that mcsally \" would be a very good member of the united states senate. \" kyl — who served alongside mccain in the senate from 1995 until he retired in 2013 — declined to say whether he would continue to serve in 2019. \" i ' m going to be discussing my plans with the governor, and everybody else will be the second to know, \" he said. Democratic political strategist donna brazile praised mcsally, the first american woman to fly a fighter jet in combat, as an example of civility. \" she clearly invoked the spirit of john mccain, \" brazile tells abc. \" as a veteran, she understands what it means to serve. Her calling continues. \" analysts say the fact that the senate race was extremely close helps make mcsally a frontrunner to replace kyl.

You initially notice smells in your environment as molecules reach your nostrils, but after your brain puts them in the non-dangerous category, \" the receptors in your nose sort of switch off, \" says cognitive psychologist pamela dalton. The purpose of this process, scientists think, is to allow us to pick up on new smells as soon as they emerge. \" whatever is new in your environment, that huge signal rises above the rest, \" dalton notes. Want to find out what your home smells like to others? more blood flow may help; try some exercise. It also might help to take a break; after vacations, dalton points out, we often recognize our houses'smells, thinking it seems a little musty inside. So if you're looking for a fresh take on your favorite perfume, maybe don't use it for a while, yahoo suggests. ( as for your own scent, it can attract or repel mosquitoes. )",

        "summary": "A toronto man has been found guilty in the 2012 murder of his father, a death that was originally ruled a suicide. Per the bbc, dellen millard told authorities his father, businessman wayne millard, suffered from alcoholism and depression as they investigated the death. After investigators concluded the gunshot wound that killed 71-year-old millard was self-inflicted, the younger millard was set to inherit millions from the family's aviation business. However, information provided to authorities by employees at millardair sparked a new investigation that would eventually change the suicide ruling to a homicide and lead to two more murder victims that police traced back to dellen millard. According to the globe and mail, investigators pinned millard and a friend to the murder of laura babcock, a 24-year-old woman he'd been dating who was killed months before wayne millard. Unbelievably, millard and the friend, mark smich, were soon also connected to the murder of 32-year-old tim bosma, which occurred months after the elder millard was found dead. Millard and smich were both convicted in the murders of babcock and bosma. They were already serving their time when millard was found guilty in his father's death. Millard is due to be sentenced in this latest case nov. 16.",

        "summary": "When archaeologists unearthed nearly 30 \" talking knots \" at the archaeological complex of incahuasi in peru in 2014, the 500-year-old bounty was notable because the knots, called khipus, had only previously been documented in graves, reported discovery at the time. This left scientists little to go on aside from the basic math that could be performed using the knots placed along the cotton or woolen cords. But this incahuasi batch was found alongside foods such as corn, beans, and peppers, suggesting that they were used for record-keeping. Archaeological conservator patricia landa has been painstakingly cleaning and untangling the inca tools in the hopes that actual context may help researchers read more than just numbers, reports the new york times. Khipus consist of several strings ( sometimes as many as 2,000 ) hanging from a main cord, typically made from llama or alpaca hair, with knots in certain locations and styles. Even the string itself can be differently colored and twisted, and is laid out in a base-10 positional system that produced highly complex record-keeping. In fact some 1,500 units of information can be displayed using khipus, reports asian scientist magazine, compared to the fewer than 800 contained in egyptian hieroglyphs. The ledgers are thought to have helped track anything from taxes to military organization. \" we can look at how the chili pepper khipu differs from the peanut khipu and from the corn khipu in terms of their color and other characteristics and we can build up a kind of sign vocabulary of how they were signifying this or that thing in their world, \" leading khipu expert gary urton, who runs the khipu database project at harvard, tells the times. \" it's tremendously exciting. \" ( this peruvian mummy predates the incas. )",

As writer douglas preston explains, \" archaeologists no longer believe in the existence of... Ciudad blanca, as described in the legends \" but suspect there are many such cities secreted away in this rainforest, \" which taken together represent something far more important — a lost civilization. \" this find points to that: an unnamed, \" scarcely studied \" civilization that apparently flourished a thousand years ago and disappeared.

More may be buried, and a team member dates what was found to ad 1000 to 1400. \" the undisturbed context is unique, \" archaeologist christopher fisher tells national geographic, which explains the found objects, many poking through the earth, have not been excavated. The hunt for the white city — the first recorded mention of which may lie in a 1526 letter from hernán cortés to spain's charles v — allegedly made headway in 1940 when explorer theodore morde emerged from the mosquitia rainforest with a huge cache of apparent white city artifacts, but he killed himself before divulging the location.

        "summary": "The dust has cleared, the votes have been counted, and barack obama stands victorious. What did we learn? what did this entire long election drama mean? politico and cnn break down some takeaways from the big night: team romney was bluffing. Romney's campaign said it had a chance in pennsylvania, minnesota, and michigan, but it turned out to be smoke and mirrors: it had no real ground game in any of them, and the tallies of voter contacts it presented to the press included unanswered phone calls and door knocks. The youth vote is here to stay. The big youth turnout in 2008 wasn't a fluke. Voters aged 18 to 29 made up 19 % of the electorate this year, inching up from 18 % in 2008 and 17 % in 2004. Republicans might want to avoid abortion. Todd akin and richard mourdock both lost winnable races, helping to keep the senate in democrats ' hands thanks largely to their controversial abortion-related comments. Labor isn't dead yet. And last night, it went for a walk, helping obama win nevada, wisconsin, and ohio. Speaking of ohio … the auto bailout mattered. Nearly 60 % of ohio voters said they approved of the government's handling of the bailout, and exit polls show that obama won three-quarters of those voters. Paul ryan didn't. Unlike sarah palin, ryan didn't wrap the race around him. He emerges more or less unscathed, having neither particularly hurt nor particularly helped romney's chances. And, one strategist tells the daily beast, he's \" immediately on shortlists for 2016. \" republicans have a serious latino problem. Latinos expanded their share of the vote to 10 %, and 71 % of them broke for obama, up from 67 % in 2008. That trend that could eventually put arizona and texas in play. For more on gop demographic woes, click here. Bush still haunts republicans. Exit polls show that the majority of voters still blame dubya for the weak economy. The big donor model didn't work. The romney camp prided itself on its efficient fundraising strategy — it focused more or less exclusively on big donors — but it forced him to spend too much time at donor retreats, and left him more or less broke by august.",

As expected, conservative members rejected the measure because it rolls back some of the sequester cuts, but not nearly enough to scuttle the deal. The senate is expected to pass it next week. The biggest point of friction today came from democrats angry that the bill makes no provision to extend long-term unemployment benefits when they expire on dec. 28, reports the hill. Sandy levin, d-mich., accused republicans of \" skipping town \" instead of addressing the issue, but republicans countered that democrats were \" showboating \" and that the long-term benefits were always intended to be temporary when they were put into place after the financial meltdown five years ago.",

Gibbs, who says he will \" determine what can be done to prevent this action, \" argues the mountain can only be renamed with an act of congress since a law was passed naming the peak mount mckinley in 1917. According to the white house, interior secretary sally jewell had every right to rename the mountain with a secretarial order. The interior department says alaska has been trying to change the name to denali — the athabascan word for \" the high one \" — since 1975 and the us board on geographic names had been deferring to congress since 1977. In cases where the board fails to act \" within a reasonable time, \" a 1947 law states the interior has the authority to alter a landmark name. Jewell says the new title is \" in recognition of the traditions of alaska natives and the strong support of the people of alaska, \" noting in the order, \" president mckinley never visited, nor did he have any significant historical connection to, the mountain or to alaska, \" per politico.

But maloney's momentum didn't translate into victory because the dga and tomblin successfully communicated to voters that he was an outsider, millionaire businessman who used west virginia to get rich and whose risky, radical positions would have taken west virginia off-course.... Continue reading bottom line: last night's result was a clear blow to national republicans. Despite huge expenditures by the rga, west virginia voters were not swayed by attempts to nationalize the race. Instead, they went with a proven west virginia tax-cutter and job-creator in earl ray tomblin. Nationally, democrats have seen setbacks in recent special elections.

        "summary": "California gov. Jerry brown signed six gun-control measures into law on friday that add new restrictions on semiautomatic weapons and ammunition, and strengthen background checks. Some related coverage: kpcc provides a quick look at the six bills that were signed and the five that were not here. One of the higher-profile measures outlaws the use of \" bullet buttons, \" which allowed gun owners to easily replace a firearm's default magazine with a high-capacity one. The ap explains. Another big one outlaws magazine clips that hold more than 10 rounds, notes the san francisco chronicle. The nra's reaction: \"this makes california the most anti-gun state in america, \" says spokeswoman amy hunter. See the group's assessment of the \" draconian \" package here. A writer at quartz, meanwhile, makes the case that \" piecemeal \" reforms aren't enough — it's time to consider changing the second amendment. Read it here. The new laws \" are the latest example of how this state, where the legislature is under democratic control, has been able to enact a legislative agenda on issues that have deadlocked congress, \" reports the new york times. The los angeles times has this intriguing line: \" at a time when mass shootings are occurring with escalating frequency, it appears brown's pragmatic side and his jesuit training has made him more open to efforts to control firearms, according to jaime regalado, a professor emeritus of political science at cal state l.a. \" the wall street journal looks at how the state already made it easier to seize guns.",

Prince tells myfox twin cities that the gray turmoil and rumors about the health of joni mitchell ( who greatly influenced prince ) hung over him while writing the song: \" with everything going on there this week, i had a lot i needed to get out, \" he says. Jay z's new business tidal will exclusively stream tonight's concert from royal farms arena from 8pm to 9pm for free, which forbes calls \" a very smart move.... That's going to be a great way for the service to get people who have only heard of it to at least visit the site. \" tidal will also give people a chance to donate to charities that affect youths in baltimore. The concert itself, however, is not free: tickets are running from $ 35 to $ 225 on ticketmaster.",

        "summary": "A new york times story over the weekend caused such a ruckus that the newspaper has responded publicly. But this one wasn't about politics or sexual harassment — the story in question was a profile of ohio resident tony hovater, a white nationalist and nazi sympathizer who took part in the charlottesville demonstrations. The story depicted hovater as a fairly typical american outside his nazi ways, someone who eats at applebee's and has \" midwestern manners [ that ] would please anyone's mother. \" the reaction came swiftly, and a tweet from nate silver at fivethirtyeight.com is typical of the criticism: \" what the hell is this, @nytimes? this article does more to normalize neo-nazism than anything i've read in a long time. \" so many people agreed that national editor marc lacey has posted an explanation of the rationale behind the story. \" the point of the story was not to normalize anything but to describe the degree to which hate and extremism have become far more normal in american life than many of us want to think, \" he writes. Lacey points out that the story described lovater as a bigot and detailed his nazi sympathies. ( \" a voice of hate in america's heartland \" was the headline. ) \" we regret the degree to which the piece offended so many readers, \" he adds, while defending the need \" to shed more light, not less, on the most extreme corners of american life. \" the story has its supporters, including mother jones reporter shane bauer. \" people mad about this article want to believe that nazis are monsters we cannot relate to, \" he writes.

Wikileaks, the anti-secrecy organization, began releasing new messages last friday from the personal email account of clinton's campaign chairman, john podesta, and has promised to issue tens of thousands more. The correspondence reveals a campaign that has struggled all year to improve a flawed candidate. As far back as march, aides were keenly aware that she was resistant to the media, perhaps out of touch with regular americans and unable to convey a clear message to voters. A month before clinton launched her campaign, her aides worked to corral her well-known love for granular policy details into a message that would both capture her agenda and present a forward-looking, aspirational vision for her presidency.

The stoneware bottle, emblazoned with the name of a mineral water named selters, was found off the polish coast in the gulf of gdansk last year, livescience reports. Preliminary lab tests suggest at least a bit of the water was left in the bottle before it was refilled with liquor by boozy sailors, upi speculates. That liquor may be a type of gin called jenever and it was diluted with water that matches selters. Should archaeologists succumb to temptation and sip a little of the gin, the old alcohol won't poison them, but \" it does not smell particularly good, \" says one scientist. Selters soda water comes from the taunus mountains in germany and was found 1,000 years ago, livescience explains. The bottle from the gdansk wreck is from the early 19th century and originated 25 miles from selters springs; it was one of 2 million likely sold in the region's village shops, adds science and scholarship in poland. The spring went dry in the early 19th century, but a new one was found in 1896; the water is still sold as a luxury product. The stinky concoction in the stoneware bottle will undergo more tests, as per upi. Livescience offers these pictures of the discovery. ( these explorers went looking for a shipwreck...

Mark matthews reports. ( published wednesday, july 16, 2014 ) a federal judge on wednesday declared the death penalty \" unconstitutional \" in the state of california – the first ruling of its kind in the united states. U.s. District court judge cormac carney in orange county called the system \" dysfunctional \" and \" arbitrary \" in his 29-page ruling. \" no rational person can question that the execution of an individual carries with it the solemn obligation of the government to ensure that the punishment is not arbitrarily imposed and that it furthers the interests of society, \" he wrote. California has not executed anyone since 2006, when a u.s. District court judge decided to block the execution of a convicted murderer because of concerns over the administration of lethal injection. Carney's ruling can be appealed to the u.s. 9th circuit court of appeals. Spokespersons for both california attorney general kamala harris and the california department of corrections said they were \" reviewing the ruling. \" aclu of northern california associate director natasha minsker, who is not directly involved in the case but following it closely, tweeted as she read the ruling, citing the judge who said the current system",

Among the bad habits that the cdc warns of are putting 99 % of contact lens wearers at risk of eye infection: rinsing them in tap water: this just isn't clean enough. \" even household tap water, although treated to be safe for drinking, is not sterile and contains microorganisms that can contaminate lens cases and contact lenses and cause eye infection, \" the cdc says. Swimming and showering with lenses in: these are also no-nos, but the survey found that 61 % and 85 % of wearers do these things, respectively, reports cbs news. Using them for far too long: this makes them more susceptible to germs. \" one thing that we see people doing a lot is using the lenses beyond the lifetime of the lens, \" american academy of ophthalmology spokesman thomas steinemann tells usa today. \" if it's a two-week lens, they keep it four or six weeks; if it's one month, they keep it two. \" not emptying the lens case: more than half of lens wearers reported sometimes \" topping off \" their lens case with more solution instead of emptying and cleaning daily as recommended. Napping or sleeping in contacts: people who say this can make you go blind are right. With the eyelid acting as a barrier, this can trap bacteria on your eye. \" when you have the plastic contact lens over the eye, you are depriving the eye of oxygen but also increasing the risk of germs attacking the cornea, \" steinemann says.

The best-case scenario for obama would be that the law is upheld in full, writes josh gerstein at politico — but it's also the best case for mitt romney, whose supporters would be energized and whose campaign would gain focus. Alternatively, if the law is struck down in full, it would be a nightmare for obama, but also bad news for romney, who would have to get specific about his own health care plans and defend a ruling that kills the more popular parts of the law, gerstein notes. The big question, notes the new york times, is whether the court's nine justices have decided that congress overstepped its bounds when it passed the individual mandate requiring most americans to buy health insurance. If so, they could decide to strike down the mandate — or the entire law. Another possibility, according to former attorney general alberto gonzales, is that the court could decide to delay ruling on the mandate until penalties take effect in 2015. Such a move would be entirely consistent with chief justice john roberts ' judicial philosophy, according to gonzales, who vetted roberts before his nomination by george w. Bush in 2005.",
