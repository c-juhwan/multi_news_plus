Femme fatale is \"the rare dance-pop album that never flags, each track preposterously overstuffed with hooks and sensations, \" writes jody rosen in slate. Spears is \"a great avant-gardist \": these are some \"absurd \" tracks, but her \"star power provides cover for the weirdness — anything she records, no matter how strange, instantly becomes pop. \" the producers have made spears ' voice into \"a mix of baby-talk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as michael jackson's yips, \" writes adam markovitz in entertainment weekly. Jon caramanica, however, firmly disagrees: \"femme fatale is blank, \" he writes in the new york times. While producers have, in the past, \"used her as a guinea pig for their cleverest work, much of the music on this album feels flat and redundant. \" \"at its best, it sounds like a party, with a cutting-edge pop soundtrack, \" writes alexis petridis in the guardian. But \"the question of precisely what britney spears brings to said party remains as imponderable as ever. \"",

It wasn't merely that the various producers of 2007's blackout – its recording somehow slotted into a pressing schedule of visits to rehab, head-shaving and being carried out of her own home strapped to a gurney while the world's media circled overheard in helicopters – took her apparently imminent demise as an excuse to try anything they fancied ( in freakshow, it contained possibly the first mainstream pop track to show the influence of dubstep ); it was that spears finally",

Thankfully, the 9-foot-long carnufex carolinensis, or \" carolina butcher, \" went extinct by the end of the triassic period, about 200 million years ago. A skull, spine, and arm from the beast were discovered in a quarry a decade ago, but researchers only recently realized their significance. \" when we got the bones out and prepared them, we found out that it was actually a really cool species, \" study author lindsay zanno tells the washington post. \" it was one of the oldest and largest members of crocodylomorph — the same group that crocodiles belong to — that we've ever seen. \" most crocodile relatives from the period were much smaller, about the size of a fox. The beast, which lived before the supercontinent pangaea broke apart, had a long skull resembling a knife, plus sharp, bladelike teeth it used to devour armored reptiles and early relatives of mammals, livescience reports. It was also \" a bit of a frankenstein, \" zanno explains. Its skull is similar in size to other reptiles of the triassic period known as rauisuchids, but also similar to today's crocodiles in that it's \" highly ornamented with bumps and grooves, \" zanno tells smithsonian. Its cheekbones and the shape of its teeth are more like those of meat-eating dinosaurs known as theropods. Though the \" carolina butcher \" eventually fell as dinosaurs rose up, \" it was clearly a top predator \" and \" that's a niche we didn't know animals like this were filling, \" zanno says. A researcher notes the find \" pushes back the date of crocodylomorphs in the fossil record \" and \" changes our thinking on what these early crocodiles looked like and what they did. \" ( a newly found dinosaur had a neck like a crane. )",

The sources say that in return for leniency, rick gates plans to change his plea to guilty and will testify against former campaign chief paul manafort, who worked with him in political consulting for around 10 years. Both men are accused of money laundering and other offenses related to their work in ukraine. One of the times'sources says gates, who has four children, can't afford an expensive legal team to defend him in the mueller probe. If \" you go to trial on this, that's $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million, \" the source says. Sources tell cnn that gates had hoped to benefit from a legal defense fund, but major gop donors aren't interested in coughing up money to defend him and manafort. Gates, 45, joined the trump campaign in june 2016, the same time as manafort, but stayed on long after manafort was fired in august. One of the times'sources says gates'testimony against manafort could be the \" cherry on top \" of mueller's case, though he doesn't believe gates has information that would help \" turn the screws on trump. \" the new york times reports that on friday, the justice department disclosed that california computer specialist richard pinedo had pleaded guilty to identity theft and was cooperating with the investigation of 13 russians charged with interfering in the 2016 election.

But on april 18, kadyrbayev and another friend, robel phillipos, recognized what appeared to be their buddy in fbi photos of the suspects. Kadyrbayev texted tsarnaev, noting the similarity in appearance — though shortly after the bombing, the christian science monitor notes, tsarnaev had reportedly shortened his hair. Tsarnaev wrote back, \" lol. \" later, he texted, \" you better not text me, \" and, \" come to my room and take whatever you want. \" the three friends headed to tsarnaev's dorm, but he wasn't there; his roommate let the group inside, where they found a backpack full of fireworks with the powder removed. That confirmed their suspicions, kadyrbayev said. Kadyrbayev considered ways to hide the evidence as the friends, phillipos said, started \" to freak out. \" kadyrbayev pushed to get rid of the backpack; according to the affidavit, phillipos responded, \" do what you have to do. \" authorities later found the backpack in a landfill.

        "summary": "The united states military academy at west point has apologized for a \" prank \" that injured the air force academy's official mascot. Aurora, a 22-year-old white gyrfalcon, suffered injuries initially thought to be life-threatening after she was abducted along with another bird ahead of saturday's annual army-air force football game in west point, the colorado spring gazette reports. Aurora was returned saturday morning with bloodied wings. The rare birds have a life expectancy of around 25 years in captivity and authorities initially feared aurora would have to be put down. Officials said sunday, however, that in an \" extremely good sign, \" she was able to fly around her pen again. She didn't make it to the game, which the army won 17-14. Sam dollar, the air force's falconry team adviser, tells the new york times that two west point cadets threw sweaters over the birds and stuffed them into dog crates. He believes aurora injured her wings while she was thrashing around inside the crate. \" i think they had them for a couple hours and then they realized it was a bad mistake, \" says dollar, who believes the bird will be fine after \" a little bit of antibiotics and food and rest. \" he notes that handling of gyrfalcons is so tightly restricted that unless you're \" federally licensed, you can't even touch them. \" west point spokeswoman lt. Col. Chevelle thomas says the army is investigating the incident, which it is taking \" very seriously. \" ( the air force also uses falcons to protect its planes. )",

The ceo of tesla and spacex plans to build two tunnels from the shell of the never-completed transit station at block 37 to the airport through his new boring company, reports the chicago sun-times. Under the broad strokes of the plan, riders would pay $ 25 to zip through the tunnels to and from the airport in electric passenger cars, or \" skates. \" in a fact sheet, the company says the trip would take 12 minutes, up to four times faster than any existing transportation. One huge factor: the project, which the company thinks it can do for less than $ 1 billion, is not supposed to use a penny of taxpayers ' money — the boring company will pay for it, then keep the money from fares and concessions. \" we're taking a bet on a guy who doesn't like to fail — and his resources, \" chicago mayor rahm emanuel tells the chicago tribune, citing musk's vision in getting tesla and spacex off the ground. \" given his track record, we are taking his reputation and saying,'this is a guy in two other transportation modes who has not failed.'that's what we're doing. \" deputy mayor robert rivkin adds a nickname that seems to be catching on, based on headlines: \" we're talking about a tesla-in-a-tunnel, \" he says. No word on when the system is supposed to be operating. Musk is apparently already building a similar system in los angeles, and he envisions a bigger project of a supersonic \" hyperloop \" between dc and new york city.

Authorities say the man, variously identified by the media as being 38 or 48 years old, sneaked into an unnamed prague eatery and hid in a bathroom as staff were closing up on sunday, per the prague post. When the coast was clear, he, as police put it, \" feasted royally \" on $ 800 worth of food — though expats.cz notes he \" sampled \" the aforementioned items rather than consumed them all — then washed it all down with several bottles of wine, authorities say. Apparently he had no room for dessert, but wrapped up beer and a strawberry cake to take with him, police say. He also packed some clothes including chef's pants, and searched the bar and employee lockers for money, authorities say. They believe his plan was to sneak out again in the morning. Instead, he was discovered by a cleaner who arrived around 9am and called police. The man now faces up to two years in prison.

        "summary": "Rihanna, kim kardashian, and others have gone to bat for a woman fighting a life sentence for killing a man when she was a teen, after she says she was forced into prostitution by her pimp boyfriend. Now, per people, the tennessee supreme court has ruled that cyntoia brown, 30, must serve at least 51 years before she can get parole; she'd be 69 when eligible. It was a unanimous decision thursday, cnn notes, after the us sixth circuit court of appeals asked the state supreme court to weigh in, as state law was unclear. The ruling was in response to brown's argument that the us supreme court ruled it unconstitutional to give juveniles mandatory life sentences without parole ( a lower court noted her life sentence did include the possibility of parole ), as well as that it's \" cruel and unusual punishment. \" the appeals court rejected her first argument but is still reviewing the second. Brown was 16 when she killed johnny mitchell allen in 2004, a real estate agent she says solicited her for sex after she was forced to serve as a prostitute by her boyfriend, \" kut throat, \" huffpost notes. She contends she shot allen after she saw him reach for a gun; prosecutors, however, said she was trying to rob allen, and she was tried and convicted as an adult. Many are noting that brown, a woman of color who says she killed in self-defense, is receiving a more severe punishment than whites who commit crimes. Huffpost cites the example of jeffrey epstein, the hedge fund manager sentenced to just 13 months in prison after being accused of sex-trafficking young girls. \" the system has failed, \" kim kardashian tweeted last year, calling the case \" heartbreaking \" and saying she was going to get her lawyers involved. ( teen prostitutes are a \" human rights scandal \" in us. )",

Horvath-cosper claims the hospital — citing security concerns — put a \" gag order \" on her to prevent her from defending abortion publicly. According to the ap, horvath-cosper says she was told by the hospital's chief medical officer that he \" did not want to put a k-mart blue light special on the fact that we provide abortions. \" \"if she can't speak out about abortion the way other doctors at the hospital do about what they work on, she is being treated differently and that is discrimination, \" an executive at national women's law center, who is acting as co-counsel for horvath-cosper's complaint, tells the times. Horvath-cosper had been a public advocate for abortion prior to december, even penning a widely read op-ed on the violence faced by abortion providers for the washington post in october. Since then, she says the hospital — having been spooked by the deadly attack on a colorado planned parenthood in november — has forced her to turn down interviews and other opportunities. She argues this actually makes violence against abortion providers more likely. \" the dialogue is dominated by those who have demonized this totally normal part of health care, \" she tells the times. Horvath-cosper's complaint cites a 1973 law that, until now, has seemingly only been used by people refusing to perform abortions for moral or religious reasons. If the complaint is successful, the hospital could lose federal funding, think progress reports.",

The hbo show features a panel of writers, directors, and producers deciding which director should be given the opportunity to direct a $ 3 million feature film; producer effie brown, who is black, is part of this season's panel, and sunday discussed her preference for the most diverse directing team that made it to the finals — a woman and a vietnamese man — noting that she thought they'd have the sensitivity required for the film. She asked the other panelists ( all of whom are white, nbc news notes ) to remember that \" the only black person \" in the film project is \" a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp, \" and because of that they should be careful which director they choose. That was the point at which damon interrupted brown to say, among other things, \" when we're talking about diversity, you do it in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the show. \" her response was a simple \" wow. \" twitter had a lot more to say, dubbing the moment #damonsplaining. Sample tweet: \" ' you see, successful black woman, diversity is whatever white, straight, men say it is.

            "The title and property of the duchy of cornwall were created in 1337 by edward iii, and were given by royal charter to his son, the prince of wales also known as the black prince. Under the charter, the duchy always belongs to the sovereign's eldest son who is the heir apparent. If the heir apparent dies without leaving children, the property of the duchy reverts to the crown. So although the duchy belongs to the prince of wales, who is also the duke of cornwall, there is a theoretical possibility that it could revert to the sovereign, who therefore has a contingent personal interest in matters that affect the property of the duchy. Bills in parliament that would affect the sovereign's private interests ( or the royal prerogative ) require the queen's consent; by extension, therefore, bills that would affect the duchy also require consent, and since the prince of wales administers the duchy he also performs the function of considering and granting relevant requests for consent. Queen's consent and prince's consent are fundamentally different from royal assent. The consents are required as a matter of parliamentary procedure, as a method of protecting crown prerogative and private interests.

Sarkar then took his own life. The victim was a professor in mechanical and aerospace engineering, according to his official bio on ucla's website. Sarkar was first named in a report by cbs news. He had a ph.d. In solid mechanics from ucla. The shooting prompted a two-hour lockdown and massive police response at the school, with lapd chief charlie beck telling the media when it was over, \"the campus is entirely contained. We believe there are no suspects outstanding and no continuing threat to ucla's campus. \" here's what you need to know: 1. Sarkar had a 'kill list ' in his home in minnesota &amp; also shot his wife ashley hasti dead there on june 2, chief beck told the l.a. Times that sarkar had a \"kill list \" at his home in st. Paul, minnesota, and had shot a woman dead in her home in the minneapolis suburb of brooklyn park."

Ucla researchers say the first ones were ancient wolves that started following hunter and gatherers around europe between 18,000 and 32,000 years ago, reports the bbc. The finding, which contradicts previous theories that domesticated dogs first appeared in the middle east or asia about 13,000 years ago, is based on dna analysis of fossils and comparison with modern dogs. Two of those fossils were more than 30,000 years old, notes phys.org. \"the initial interactions were probably at arm's length, as these were large, aggressive carnivores, \" one of the researchers tells the la times. \" eventually though, wolves entered the human niche. \" the two species probably helped each other — the wolves got carcasses of woolly mammoths and the like, and the humans got an alarm system around their nomadic camps. One thing common in all the coverage of the study in science: nobody expects this to be the final word in the debate.",

            "When it comes to evolutionary debates, this one is a major dogfight. Since the time of charles darwin, scientists have argued over the origin of domesticated dogs, speculating wildly about how, when and where a toothy, flesh-eating beast was first transformed into man's best friend. Some experts believe humans were naturally drawn to small, furry wolf pups, and seized them as novelties. Others suggest they were raised for slaughter by early agrarian societies. Yet another theory holds that early proto-dogs were enlisted as helpers by roving bands of hunters, long before humankind ever experimented with agricultural livestock. \"the experts get quite exercised about who's right and who's wrong, \" said james serpell, a professor at the university of pennsylvania school of veterinary medicine. \"whether that's just scientific hubris, i don't know. \" but the epic argument over what sparked",

The 72-year-old schooley will now be sent to kansas, where all the defendants — including a construction company — additionally face charges of aggravated battery and aggravated endangering of a child. Those charges stem from injuries, including concussions, suffered by 13 riders before caleb's raft went airborne and collided with a metal hoop on aug. 7, 2016, killing him and injuring two others, reports nbc 5. Prosecutors allege water park employees tried to hide from investigators documents describing the injuries.

        "summary": "Like scientific mysteries? then consider the electric-blue clouds that are becoming more common and appearing in unexpected parts of the world, the san francisco chronicle reports. Called \" noctilucent clouds \" or \" night-shining clouds, \" they were first reported above polar regions in 1885 and have appeared every summer since, noted space.com last year. They could be seen in northerly regions like russia, scandinavia, and britain, but have recently appeared as far south as virginia, utah, and colorado, prompting media outlets to revisit an old question of whether noctilucent clouds are caused by global warming. What's the connection? well, noctilucent clouds — the \" highest clouds of all, \" per the guardian — form some 50 miles above ground in the earth's upper atmosphere, or mesosphere, where conditions aren't always suitable to cloud formation. Enter greenhouse gases, which scientists say warm the atmosphere but actually cool the mesosphere and therefore make noctilucent clouds more likely, the guardian reports. That's because clouds are formed partly by ice crystals, and \" extreme cold is required to form ice in a dry environment like the mesosphere, \" a professor told nasa years ago. Tony phillips, who tracks clouds for spaceweather.com, says \" the jury is still out \" on the global-warming connection, but notes that the greenhouse gas methane \" favor[ s ] the formation of nlcs at very high altitudes \" by producing water that helps form the clouds. An interesting side note: clouds ' water molecules need something to stick to, like dust from earth's sand storms, but nlcs are so high up that they may be gathering dust from meteorites. ( meanwhile, last month was the hottest recorded in 135 years. )",

There have been 12 quakes since last thursday, the strongest of them a 3.3-magnitude quake that came amid five smaller quakes on monday. State officials plan to hold a briefing to discuss preparedness in case the quakes continue, nbc connecticut reports. The quakes are centered around the town of plainfield, where police have fielded hundreds of calls from worried residents; some homes have sustained damage to drywall or had pictures knocked off walls, reports the providence journal. Experts say quakes are unusual but not completely unheard of in the region, and the quake swarm could be linked to pressure in a 400-million-year-old fault line near plainfield. \" the hypothesis is that you're getting the release of stress when these ancient faults are breaking, \" a yale geology professor tells cbs. \" if you look at a geological map of eastern connecticut, there are a lot of faults and there may well be faults we don't know about because they don't extend to the surface. \" she says it's impossible to tell whether the quakes could end tomorrow or continue for months.

The bbc reports the snakes are extremely venomous but cnn reports most typically don't transmit a lethal dose of the venom with their bites. ( the new york times previously explained they're designed to deliver enough to paralyze smaller prey, not creatures of our size. ) further, the snakes rarely come into contact with humans, and when they do, one australian professor describes them as peaceful. \" people go scuba diving with them all the time, \" he says. The key difference here is that the snake was tangled in the net and potentially injured, and \" perhaps looking to lash out. \" there are 70 known species of sea snake, nearly half of which are found in australian waters; officials didn't say which species bit the man.

But there are also genetic grounds for the mongoose's courage. Sometimes an attacking mongoose is bitten, but it has another line of defense against the venom — its acetylcholine receptor has also evolved so that the cobra neurotoxin cannot bind to it.

The president's campaign organization on tuesday filed an arbitration action against the former white house employee, accusing her of violating a nondisclosure agreement she signed when joining the 2016 campaign, reports abc news. While manigault newman says she did not sign a new nondisclosure deal when she took her subsequent job at the white house, the campaign says her 2016 agreement remains in force, and the washington examiner says it prevents her speaking ill of trump \" during the time of your service and at all times thereafter. \" manigault newman has not yet commented on the legal action, but she has 14 days to respond to the demand for a hearing. An arbitrator would ultimately determine whether she violated the pact and, if so, what penalties would result. One campaign official tells the examiner they are seeking \" millions, \" possibly including any money she makes from her new memoir, unhinged. In the book, manigault newman calls trump a racist and alleges that he used the n-word during his apprentice years. In response, he has called her a \" dog \" and a \" lowlife. \"",

The post presented this as a conflict of interest because it would have given trump, then running for president, a major business interest in russia. The deal never came to pass, but now the new york times has a follow-up on the actual content of those emails, sent by the russian-born felix sater to trump attorney michael cohen. Sater, the times explains, was a broker for the trump organization who earned money by delivering real estate deals. And he was pushing hard for this one, suggesting it would help trump's chances of getting elected: our boy: \"buddy, \" sater wrote, \" our boy can become president of the usa and we can engineer it. I will get all of putins team to buy in on this, i will manage this process. \" ivanka: at another point, sater, in an apparent attempt to boast of his connections, said he helped arrange a visit to the kremlin by ivanka trump in 2006. \"i arranged for ivanka to sit in putins private chair at his desk and office in the kremlin, \" he wrote. In a statement, ivanka trump confirmed she visited the kremlin but said she never met putin. She didn't address the odd chair statement. So what does all this mean? cohen, for his part, says not much because sater is prone to \" puffery. \" but the emails are now in the hands of the house intelligence committee as part of its investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 election.

While many dairy products are high in saturated fat — and health guidelines recommend limiting saturated fat in your diet, per the independent — the studies involving almost a million participants showed dairy products have a \" neutral \" effect on health. Fermented cheese might even lower one's risk of cardiovascular disease slightly, the report finds, per newsweek. Researchers acknowledge three pro-dairy groups helped fund the review but say they had no input in the results, per the guardian. \" there's quite a widespread but mistaken belief among the public that dairy products in general can be bad for you, \" says ian givens of reading university, an author of the report in the european journal of epidemiology. This is one reason why young people are drinking less milk, putting them at risk of osteoporosis in later life, he adds. But \" our meta-analysis included an unusually large number of participants. We are confident that our results are robust and accurate. \" some still remain unconvinced. A doctor at the british heart foundation, for example, says \" decades of research have proved that a diet rich in saturated fat increases ' bad ' ( ldl ) cholesterol in your blood, which puts you at greater risk of a heart attack or stroke, \" per cnbc.

That's not the plot for an upcoming sci-fi miniseries. \"sharknado \" was fantasy, but rats the size of sheep or even cows will likely populate earth's future one day, says a scientist from the united kingdom. Dr. Jan zalasiewicz of the university of leicester's department of geology says that as large mammals continue to go extinct, we should expect to see opportunistic rats step up to wield greater and greater influence in their place. Rats will have no problem filling an ecological niche it's all a matter of available ecospace and the hardy, competitive nature of rats, says dr.

He later added: \" peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if i don't always agree, i recognize the rights of people to express their views. \" a look around the landscape the day after the marches: there were in fact three times as many marchers in the women's march as people attending trump's inauguration, crowd-counting experts tell the new york times. They put the numbers at 470,000 in the vicinity of the national mall at 2pm on saturday to 160,000 people in the hour before trump was sworn in. Usa today estimates that 2.5 million marched worldwide; the breakdown by city is here. Those marchers were at more than 670 events, reports the washington post. \" this is actually my first protest, \" one dc protester says.

Apparently that was the strategy of emil michael at a friday dinner in nyc, where he spouted outrage over a column critical of the ride-sharing app last month on pandodaily, reports buzzfeed. Michael singled out pando founder and column author sarah lacy, saying she should be held \" personally responsible \" for women who get assaulted if they dump uber. He then mentioned coughing up \" a million dollars \" to hire opposition researchers and journalists to dig into the personal lives and families of overly critical journos — especially lacy, whom he said this hypothetical team could target for a \" very specific claim about her personal life. \" \" no one would know it was us, \" he reportedly said. Michael believed the dinner was off the record, but the buzzfeed reporter allegedly hadn't been told that. Lacy, a vocal critic of uber, its ceo travis kalanick, and silicon valley sexism, posted a column last night addressing his statements. Michael issued his own statement, as well as an emailed apology to lacy, through uber last night: \" the remarks attributed to me at a private dinner — borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what i feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company i am proud to work for — do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company's views or approach.

Earlier this evening, a bombshell story by buzzfeed editor-in-chief ben smith proves the reality is way worse than anyone on our team could have expected. And that's saying something. Back in 2012, paul carr first raised serious concerns about the company's view that both riders and drivers are disposable commodities in an all-out randian battle to maximize profits. He uninstalled the app when he wrote that piece, and he started a drumbeat of press around these concerns. Then, in 2014, carmel deamicis exposed that an uber driver accused of assault had a criminal record that should have been uncovered by the background checks uber claimed to do.

As a woman in this industry struggling mightily with growing sexism in tech demonstrated by people like uber founder travis kalanick, it felt like a punch to the stomach. I didn't actually think uber could shock me anymore. I was wrong. I've spent weeks since my 6,000-word rant on silicon valley assholes having private conversations with the vcs who fund them.

In addition, the author says the first comic strip, \" the black smurfs, \" was a thinly veiled commentary on a racial threat. \" in that album, the smurfs are sick, \" he says. \" and when they're sick, they don't turn purple or red or anything like that, they become black.

A police officer who was driving home just after midnight said he tried to stop a pt cruiser that zipped by him at around 100mph, but as they approached the skyway bridge, the cruiser pulled over and the officer says jonchuck got out, tossed his daughter over the side of the bridge, and drove south. Jonchuck was picked up by manatee county police about 30 minutes later, according to wfts. Rescue personnel that included the coast guard and st. Petersburg fire rescue searched for phoebe, who had plunged 62 feet and fallen into the water, but it was eckerd college divers who finally found her; revival attempts were unsuccessful, and she was pronounced dead at 2: 44am at a local hospital, the ap notes. Jonchuck has been charged with first-degree murder, aggravated fleeing and eluding, and aggravated assault with a motor vehicle on a police officer, wftv reports.

But a new study out of mit and published in nature shows those memories may still be somewhere in the brain and, what's more, could be recoverable. That's because, contrary to earlier scientific thought, the problem in alzheimer's patients appears to be memory recovery, not memory storage. \" even if a memory seems to be gone, it is still there, \" nobel prize-winning scientist susumu tonegawa tells the post. \" it's a matter of how to retrieve it. \" a harvard neurology professor tells the boston herald the research conducted by tonegawa's team \" shattered a 20-year paradigm of how we're thinking about the disease. \" in the study, mice genetically altered to have alzheimer's-like symptoms didn't seem to remember an earlier electric shock and fear further shocks. That changed when researchers stimulated brain cells associated with short-term memory in the mice. And while it opens the possibility of one day helping alzheimer's patients recover their lost memories, it's not a process that is repeatable in humans and further research is needed. \" we're still many years away from knowing if it would be possible to restore lost memories in people, \" one expert tells the guardian.

The research, conducted in mice, raises the possibility of future treatments that reverse memory loss in early stages of the disease. Scientists used a technique called optogenetics, which uses light to activate cells tagged with a special photo-sensitive protein. It was tested on mice with alzheimer's-like symptoms that quickly forgot the experience of receiving a mild electric shock to their feet. After tagged cells in their brains were stimulated with light, their memory returned and they displayed a fear response when placed in the chamber where the shock had been applied an hour earlier. The optogenetic treatment helped the neurons re-grow small buds called dendritic spines, which form synaptic connections with other cells.

Tuesday night produced a few of them, which we recall here. \" i almost wish there were another podium here tonight, because i feel like nancy pelosi has been in this campaign the whole time. And nancy ought to take a victory lap with me. And maybe president obama as well. The disservice and disrespect that has been leveled on them has been so outrageous and so unjustified that it makes me really fear for this country. When you have two people who work every day to make life better for every american and they put up with the nonsense … [ i ] t's not only unjustified, it's un-american. \" 2. Linda mcmahon ( candidate for senate in connecticut ) mcmahon, the wwe executive who spent over $ 40 million on her own campaign, suffered a solid defeat. The general tone of her aggressive campaign attacks on richard blumenthal might have led viewers to expect a bitter concession; however, her performance was surprisingly classy. On a night when platitudes about \" pennsylvanians, \" \" nevadans \" and \" the people of delaware \" largely came across as tinned, her profession of \" love \" for the people of her state sounded genuine. And perhaps most significant, in a year of rabid partisanship, she was one of the only losing candidates to insist that her followers transfer their support to a victorious rival, projecting her voice over a booing crowd to say: \" each of us, because we [ carry ] a love for this state and for our country, in our hearts, we are all going to be supportive of our newly",

        "summary": "An international team of researchers has discovered a 700,000-year-old butchered rhinoceros on the island of luzon in the philippines, forcing scientists to radically adjust current estimates about when humans first occupied the archipelago. Previously, a 67,000-year-old foot bone found in a cave in northern luzon was the oldest evidence of human habitation in the area, reports the guardian. The team also found 57 stone tools, as well as two possible hammer stones, near the animal, according to a phys.org news release. Scientists aren't certain who these early humans were, but they weren't modern day homo sapiens. The study, published in the science journal nature, was co-authored by dr. Gerrit van den bergh, a palaeontologist at the university of wollongong. Van den bergh tells the australia broadcasting company that the humans at luzon could be a distinct sub-species, but were probably homo erectus. Homo erectus are believed to have migrated to china and southeast asia as much as a million years ago. \"the original story for human evolution was very basic, that maybe there was one single migration into places like southeast asia, \" gilbert price, paleontologist at the university of queensland tells the australia broadcasting company. \"but it's becoming so much more complicated now. \" price was not involved in the study. The find begs a tantalizing new question: how on earth did the early humans get to luzon? early humans presumably didn't have boats to cross large bodies of water. Thomas ingicco, lead author of the study, says they could have arrived accidentally during typhoons or tsunamis, per the smithsonian. ( new discoveries also are altering human history on africa. )",

At least that's the hope of the team of researchers at stanford university who developed artificial skin that can sense touch. Engadget describes the team's invention — published thursday in science — as \" two layers of rubbery plastic skin with a flexible circuit printed on. \" billions of electricity-conducting carbon nanotubes are scattered between the layers. The closer they're squeezed together, the more electricity they conduct. \" this is the first time a flexible, skin-like material has been able to detect pressure and also transmit a signal to a component of the nervous system, \" team leader zhenan bao says in a stanford press release. It's the second part of that process that's proved tricky. Nbc news reports bao and her team used something called optogenetics to show electric signals generated by the skin can get to the brain. Basically, they turned pressure signals into light signals then genetically engineered mouse cells to respond to them. But researchers are still a long way from testing that in a human, and bao doesn't believe optogenetics is the long-term solution, according to engadget. The team hopes to one day use their technology to make prosthetics that can feel like human skin, but they still have a ways to go. According to the press release, pressure is only one of six sensing mechanisms — such as friction and temperature — that help skin let you know whether you're, say, petting a cat or a cactus.

The women also receive a stipend from the us olympic committee when they go to the world championships, as well as paid-for expenses during the olympics and a bonus depending on how they medal. But the women say they need enough to cover them during non-olympic years, as they don't have an nhl paycheck to fall back on like the guys — and since they're still expected to train full time and compete during those years, espn notes. Usa hockey president jim smith says the group is there to support the players, not employ them. The organization says other \" incentives \" could bring a player's salary close to $ 85,000 during an olympic year, but the women argue that's only if they win gold and that the lion's share of the money comes from the us olympic committee. The new york times says other than a boycott or waiting it out, the women's only other recourse may be an eeoc complaint. Usa hockey executive director dave ogrean tells usa today the group will find other players to compete in the championships if the women pull out, which they say they will if there's not \" significant progress \" in negotiations, per their statement at sb nation.",

It's not known whether the north has actually tested such a warhead, though it has boasted of doing so. Combined with the nation's progress in testing intercontinental ballistic missiles, which could someday reach us shores, the news will only raise the pressure on president trump and the international community. Related developments: trump fires back: after the post story appeared, trump made a jarring statement: \" north korea best not make any more threats to the united states, \" he told reporters, per abc news. \" they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. \" he said kim jong un has been \" very threatening \" and reiterated that the north \" will be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which the world has never seen before. \" caveat: it remains unclear just how firm the new assessment by the defense intelligence agency is, notes the atlantic.

The book has no company name on it, the oklahoman reports; in the bottom left corner of the ticket is a box where the employee signed off on the work, and the ticket in question contains three letters. \" we want help in identifying those three letters, identifying who that person was that wrote in that book, \" said florence. The ticket book has been in the bureau's possession for years; under a state law that was altered in 2011, the bureau finally had the ability to share the evidence with the public in hopes it will bring closure to the case. The bureau said it received a number of calls within a day of revealing the ticket. The oklahoman reports that the 21-year-old's throat was cut, and she had been stabbed a number of times. There was no sign of forced entry, and a fingerprint found at the scene has proved a dead end. Eyewitnesses reported seeing neilson at home just before noon; afternoon calls to her placed by family members wanting to wish her a happy birthday went unanswered.

The russian planes were headed for beirut, where about 100 people, mostly women and children, had gone to be evacuated. Syrian rebels have said that russian citizens are \" legitimate targets \" in their war to topple president bashar al-assad because \" russia, like iran, supports the assad regime with weapons and ammunition, as well as in the political arena. \" syrian officials blamed rebels for the powerless capital, where outages and shortages of cooking gas and gasoline remind people of the war being waged mostly elsewhere in the country. \" we covered ourselves from the cold in blankets because there was no diesel or electricity for the heaters, \" said a 60-year-old retired teacher in damascus. \" we have no idea when the power will come or go. \" the city saw some of its power returned today, but an area stretching about 31 miles north remained hampered by the outage.",

Samuel see, 34, was found dead around 6am sunday after spending the night in a jail cell, and police say they do not believe he committed suicide, reports nbc connecticut. Before he was sent to the detention center, he had been treated for a minor injury sustained in a dispute with his estranged husband, who had arrived at his home to collect belongings despite both men having protective orders against each other. When see was reminded of the protective order, \" he yelled that it was his house and that he shouldn't be arrested. See fought with officers when they tried handcuffing him, \" a police spokesman says. \" as see was led to a police car, he yelled to one of the arresting officers, ' i will kill you...

Quartz reports that 301 species of land mammals — from bats and primates to rodents and big cats — are being hunted into extinction. And for the vast majority — 285 species — the reason is food, not poaching or sport hunting. Some estimates claims more than a million metric tons of wild animal meat is collected in africa every year. And approximately $ 200 million worth of wild animal meat is harvested yearly in the brazilian amazon, according to the telegraph. \" these species will continue to decline unless there is major global action to save them, \" the study's lead author, bill ripple, says. The 285 species are found in poorer countries where protein is hard to find, with the most living in madagascar, indonesia, the philippines, and brazil. Researchers say tens of millions of people around the world rely on wild animals for meat. They lay out a series of solutions for what they call a \" global crisis, \" phys.org reports. Those include creating more protected land for wild animals, providing legal rights for sustainable hunting, swapping high-protein plants like soy and tubers for wild animal meat, and increasing access to education and family planning.

        "summary": "A government shutdown starting midnight friday is looking like a strong possibility: a short-term spending bill to avert a government shutdown was passed by the house thursday evening, largely along party lines, but the measure appears unlikely to pass the senate, reuters reports. After a last-minute deal with the conservative house freedom caucus, the stopgap spending measure passed the house 230-197, with six democrats in favor and 11 republicans, mostly conservatives, voting against it, the ap reports. The bill funds the government through feb. 16, but senate democrats, who are seeking a deal on daca, have served notice that they plan to filibuster it. The bill needs 60 votes to pass the senate, but at least 39 democrats and two republicans oppose it. Democrats and republicans are already trading blame for the likely shutdown. \" president trump wants to shut down the government over his cynical and misbegotten ' big beautiful wall, ' which will be paid for by us taxpayers, not mexico, \" democratic sen. Patrick leahy said. Democrats ' \" demands on illegal immigration, at the behest of their far-left base, have crowded out all other important business, \" said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, per the washington post. Other senators from both parties said they still hoped to reach a deal to prevent the first shutdown since 2013, the new york times reports. \" i don't want to play shutdown politics, \" said gop sen. Cory gardner. \" i think it's a bad idea and a pox on both parties. \" ( if a shutdown happens, mcconnell has a plan. )",

That's because the five-year study found no evidence that the practice has a \" widespread, systemic impact on drinking water, \" reports the wall street journal. The report, however, spells out \" potential vulnerabilities \" to water supplies caused by fracking, the result being that both sides are claiming victory. An industry exec, for example, says the report confirms that \" hydraulic fracturing is being done safely under the strong environmental stewardship of state regulators and industry best practices. \" but the executive director of the sierra club has an opposing take: \"the epa's water quality study confirms what millions of americans already know — that dirty oil and gas fracking contaminates drinking water, \" says michael brune. A blog post at earthworks, meanwhile, calls the epa's acknowledgement of risks a \" watershed moment. \" in particular, the epa says drinking water is endangered \" when the fracking goes directly into formations that hold drinking water resources, wells are not adequately constructed, or wastewater is not treated appropriately before being discharged into areas where drinking water is drawn, \" reports the hill. The epa says its study will give governments, the industry, and local communities \" a critical resource to identify how best to protect public health and their drinking water resources. \"",

        "summary": "An ancient people lived in the arctic a thousand years ago, leaving behind few clues to explain their heritage or sudden disappearance. Now a new dna study sheds light on the so-called dorset people, saying they migrated from asia around 3000 bc and became the first settlers in the north american arctic for roughly four millennia, the smithsonian reports. Genetically distinct, they didn't mix with the other three migrations to the new world — including the neo-eskimo/thule people who arrived a couple hundred years before the dorsets vanished. The study's analysis of over 150 ancient dna samples also explodes two earlier theories: that the dorset people had descended from earlier new world migrants, and had survived into the 20th century on a canadian island, nbc news reports. The roughly 4,000 dorsets also left us physical clues, like primitive stone tools, pretty figurines of ivory and wood, and evidence of small villages with 20 to 30 people each. They likely survived by leading highly traditional lives devoted to the land and resources, says study co-author bill fitzhugh: \" one might almost say... That the dorsets were the hobbits of the eastern arctic, a very strange and very conservative people that we're only just getting to know a little bit. \" so why did they go extinct? possibly due to climate change or inbreeding, the new york times reports, or maybe the thules wiped them out with advanced weaponry. By this theory, the dorsets \" were just no match for this onslaught from this thule machine, \" says fitzhugh. \" they were, in a sense, sitting ducks. \" yet the dorsets live on in tales told by thule descendants — the modern-day inuit — as a race of \" gentle giants. \" ( see how the \" first americans \" paused in their migration for 10,000 years. )",
