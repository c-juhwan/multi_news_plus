        "summary": "Smokers could soon benefit from new drugs that improve the function of their lungs, owing to the lucky few who smoke for years with little consequence. Uk researchers scanned 50,000 smokers and non-smokers, including some who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and identified gene mutations that enhance lung function. Basically, smokers with these \" good genes \" had a lower risk of copd while those with \" bad genes \" were more likely to develop the disease. This helps explain why non-smokers sometimes get sick, reports the guardian. A researcher tells the bbc the genes affect how lungs grow and react to damage. But \" there doesn't appear to be any kind of magic bullet that would give anyone guaranteed protection against tobacco smoke, \" he adds. A smoker with good genes \" would still have lungs that were unhealthier than they would be had they been a non-smoker. \" the study, which involved scanning 28 million genetic variants in each participant, also identified five sections of dna more commonly found in smokers that may affect how easily a person can become addicted to nicotine. That finding, however, still needs to be confirmed. The study offers \" fantastic new clues about how the body works that we really had little idea about before and it's those things that are likely to lead to some really exciting breakthroughs for drug development, \" says a researcher. More specifically, understanding how a person's genes relate to disease and tobacco addiction can help scientists \" design and develop better and more targeted treatments that are likely to be more effective and have fewer side effects, \" a scientist adds. Researchers hope to expand the study group to 500,000 in 2016, per a release. ( a similar study found some smokers may have genes that repair damage. )",

        "summary": "Sully, the capt. Chesley sullenberger biopic currently getting rave reviews, needed some villains other than the geese that flew into the engines of the plane the pilot was flying during the \" miracle on the hudson. \" those villains: the accident investigators, who can be seen in the film's trailer harshly interrogating sully about the crash. And the national transportation safety board isn't particularly happy with how it's being portrayed. The board put out a statement clarifying that it was not asked to participate in the production of the movie and thus could not ensure it was portrayed accurately, and people involved with the investigation say that in real life, if anything, investigators were easy on sully. \" i think we're getting the dirty end of the stick here, \" the ntsb veteran who oversaw the investigation tells bloomberg. He adds, to the new york times, \" we weren't out to hose the crew. \" he says the ntsb investigators treated sully fairly and, far from criticizing him in their final report, credited him with saving lives with his quick decision to land on the hudson river. The movie, though, makes the case that the investigation \" threatened to destroy [ sully's ] reputation and his career. \" in speaking about the film, director clint eastwood said investigators were trying to make it seem as if the accident was sully's fault. In reality, says another retired member of the ntsb team that interviewed sully, \" there was no effort to crucify him or embarrass him. \" in fact, he adds, \" i personally was very impressed \" with the flight crew's actions. \" the basic premise of the film is simply inaccurate, \" another source connected to the ntsb tells conde nast traveler. Sullenberger was involved with the movie's development, and says in a statement that it \" reflects the many challenges that i faced and successfully overcame both during and after the flight. \" as the nyt points out, the movie does not use investigators'real names.",

But the filmmakers faced one big problem: where's the suspense? the facts are well-known: the flight itself lasted all of four minutes — from take off at new york's laguardia airport, to that unlucky collision with a flock of geese that took out both engines, after which passengers endured a heart-stopping ride as sully and his co-pilot jeff skiles made the call to ditch the airbus a320 in an icy hudson river rather than return to the airport. The evacuation and water rescue took only 24 minutes, as ferries and other vessels in the area quickly came to the rescue. The national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) investigation and public hearing that followed were anticlimactic — the crew, including the three flight attendants on board, had done the right thing, according to the board's final report. That's, well, kind of boring. Director eastwood has admitted that he needed a villain. \"where's"

The topic: issues facing transgender people after an anti-discrimination ordinance was passed. The canvassers took 10 minutes to explain the ordinance, ask voters for their take on transgender people, and have the voters recall a time when they themselves were judged for being different, thus encouraging \" voters to see how their own experience offered a window into transgender people's experiences. \" they say 70 % of those who opened their doors went through the entire exercise, and three months later, they were more likely to show \" positive \" feelings toward transgender people than those in a control group.",

        "summary": "Joseph kabila has been president of the democratic republic of congo since 2001. His second — and constitutionally mandated final — term ended monday at midnight. Only the 45-year-old kabila refused to step down. Here's what you need to know: with kabila refusing to relinquish power, violence is breaking out. The guardian reports 20 people were killed as protesters clashed with security officials. Oddly, kabila's chief diplomat tells newsweek that kabila would be guilty of treason if he stepped down. The country failed to hold an election in november as planned, and the diplomat says the constitution requires kabila to stay in power until a successor is elected. But the ruling party states that won't happen until april 2018 at the earliest. The new york times reports it might not be desire for power that's keeping kabila from ceding the presidency but rather a fear he ' ll lose his fortune in the process. Investigators say kabila has stolen millions in public assets through \" dubious mining rights sales \" and \" possible money-laundering schemes. \" in the months leading up to the end of kabila's second term, the washington post did an extremely rare public opinion poll in the democratic republic of congo, finding that 81 % of people don't want the constitution changed to give kabila a third term and 74 % want him to step down by the end of the year. The guardian notes that the current situation isn't rare for the country. The democratic republic of congo hasn't had a peaceful transfer of power since gaining independence 56 years ago and is facing what could be an especially violent period. Meanwhile, the democratic republic of congo's former colonial ruler — belgium — says it will \" re-examine \" its relationship with the country in the wake of what some are describing as a coup by kabila, according to the independent.",

The results now go to president obama and congress for consideration, but it's unclear whether they will result in a formal congressional vote down the road.

Saves the film, not to speak of the world, say critics. This movie is \" bigger, louder and dumber than its predecessor \" but still plenty of fun, writes bill goodykoontz at the arizona republic, praising downey's \" enormously entertaining \" performance as the marvel comics superhero. The flawed hero is still an absorbing character and mickey rourke has some great \" psycho-slavic stylings \" as a bad guy, but in contrast to its predecessor, iron man 2 relies too much on cgi battles and \" is more about iron than men, \" writes lisa schwarzbaum at entertainment weekly. Downey's iron man could be \" a self-destructive hero out of a dostoyevsky or mailer novel \" and his performance is worth the ticket price, richard corliss writes at time. The rest, however, is \" a cluttered, clattering toy story. \" director jon favreau hasn't suffered a \" sophomore slump \" with this sequel, writes pete hammond at box office magazine. \" this iron man may not be the godfather ii of comic book movie sequels critics hope for but it is a complete blast anyway. \"",

The sweetener had been linked to cancer in lab mice, and industry executives blamed the decline in sales on concerns people have about aspartame. The august 2015 removal of the sweetener tested the theory that it was to blame for fleeing customers. But the move seems to have been a misstep, with the sales drop only \" accelerating, \" the wall street journal reports. The company will in september start selling the new diet pepsi labeled as \" classic sweetener blend, \" which will contain aspartame in its formula. Diet pepsi will continue to be sweetened with sucralose. Meanwhile, pepsi max will be re-introduced to us consumers as pepsi zero sugar and will still contain aspartame, reports the ap. The journal sees that move as an attempt to mirror coca-cola zero, a diet brand whose us volumes fell 3.3 % in q1 of 2016 — to diet coke's 5.7 % and diet pepsi's 10.6 %. \" consumers want choice in diet colas, so we're refreshing our us lineup to provide three options that meet differing needs and taste preferences, \" pepsico said.

            "New york ( ap ) — pepsico is creating a new diet beverage for fans of aspartame less than a year after pulling the artificial sweetener as part of a marketing move over safety concerns. The sweetener had been linked to cancer in lab mice and industry executives blamed the decline in sales on concerns people have about aspartame. The removal of the sweetener tested the theory that it was to blame for fleeing customers. But, the move seems to have been a misstep, with consumers dissatisfied over the change in flavor without the sweetener. The company will start selling the new diet pepsi classic sweetener blend this fall, which will contain aspartame in its formula. But, diet pepsi will continue to be sweetened without aspartame. Meanwhile, pepsi max will be re-introduced to u.s. Consumers as pepsi zero sugar and will still contain aspartame. The changes were first reported by the publication beverage digest and later confirmed by pepsico. \" consumers want choice in diet colas, so we're refreshing our u.s.

Two cycling police officers were patrolling a montreal bike path last wednesday when they spotted two men they suspected of having drugs, police say. The suspects took off running and the officers pursued, one eventually jumping off his bike and chasing the men on foot, reports cbc news. The effort paid off when both suspects were caught near a train station. But it was only later during fingerprinting that police officers realized exactly what they'd accomplished, per ctv news. One of the men captured was katay-khaophone sychanta, 35, who held a spot on the us immigration and customs enforcement's list of the top 10 most wanted criminals. The laos-born man — who also had a canada-wide warrant out for his arrest, per the canadian press — is accused of running an ontario-based drug smuggling operation that \" supplied millions of ecstasy pills and hundreds of pounds of marijuana to several distributors located in michigan, ohio, illinois, massachusetts, georgia, and new york, \" the ice says, per the montreal gazette. Sychanta, who was considered armed and dangerous, had also made threats against law enforcement officials, per the ice. He was arraigned thursday on charges of drug possession, obstructing police work, and possessing counterfeit documents, per a police report. He's now in the custody of ontario provincial police and may face extradition to the us, per the cbc.",

        "summary": "Boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev was sentenced to death by lethal injection yesterday, making him the 62nd person on federal death row. But he won't be executed for years — maybe decades — as the appeals process runs its course. Here's the timeline: sentencing hearing: judge george o'toole jr. Will schedule a sentencing hearing to formally impose the sentence. Survivors of the bombing will be given a chance to give victim impact statements. Tsarnaev also will be allowed to speak if he chooses. Prison assignment: the us bureau of prisons could send tsarnaev to the federal penitentiary in terre haute, indiana, which has a special unit for death row inmates and is where oklahoma city bomber timothy mcveigh was executed. Appeal process: tsarnaev could spend years appealing his death sentence. Seventy-four people have been sentenced to death since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, but only three have been executed ( 10 were removed from death row ). Those 3 were mcveigh ( 2001 ), juan raul garza ( 2001, for a triple drug murder ), and louis jones ( 2013, for rape and murder ). Grounds for appeal: tsarnaev's lawyers fought unsuccessfully to move his trial out of massachusetts, where they argued there was too much of an emotional impact to find truly impartial jurors. The change-of-venue issue may be one of the grounds for appeal. The guardian presents a second: that the defense \" was given insufficient time to mount a full argument in mitigation that might have convinced the jury to spare tsarnaev \" from death. And the boston globe notes that if those lines of appeal fail, he could appeal on more fundamental grounds, such as whether the death penalty is constitutional in the first place. If he is executed: he'd join the list of the 340 inmates executed by the feds since 1790.",

        "summary": "Night has fallen with search crews finding no wreckage from the malaysia airlines jet that is presumed to have crashed into the gulf of thailand south of vietnam. The only clue remains two long streaks of oil in the water. The boeing 777 had reported no problems before disappearing from radar, and authorities are nowhere near ready to speculate on what might have gone wrong. But most coverage is now taking note of one suspicious-seeming fact: two of the passengers appeared to be traveling with stolen passports, reports the new york times. Specifically, an austrian and an italian listed on the manifest had their passports stolen previously in thailand, reports ap. Which may not mean anything, of course, and the wall street journal quotes a european security official as saying it's not that unusual for stolen passports to turn up. But it's fishy enough to catch the attention of us security officials. \"we are aware of the reporting on the two stolen passports,  \" one tells nbc news. \"we have not determined a nexus to terrorism yet, although it's still very early, and that's by no means definitive. \" the chief executive of malaysia airlines also addressed the reports, declaring that \" we are not ruling out anything. \"",

One georgia state junior says she paid as much as $ 200 a month on top of her fees in sorority-related expenses, with the times finding that \" bigs \" often spend hundreds on gifts for new members, called \" littles. \" \" i was 17 and not thinking about billing, \" she tells the times. \" it was like signing up for a loan — they said the debt could go to a collections agency if you failed to pay. \" the time commitment is a hefty one, too, and sororities can actually issue fines if you miss an event, even if it was to do schoolwork ( sometimes-legitimate excuses: a funeral or a doctor's appointment, assuming you have a note ). In the case of upenn's alpha delta pi, missing a chapter meeting means a $ 10 fine; missing an event costs up to $ 100.

Divers reached the group inside the cave tuesday, and along with food they brought a doctor and a nurse who are providing health checks and medical treatment, the bbc reports. Officials say all 13 are healthy, the ap reports; a diver tells sky news they were weak after having had no solid food and surviving only on water. The group was found alive monday, on a rock shelf inside an air pocket in the cave. But getting them out is no easy task, as it is believed most of them can't swim; they would need to don scuba diving masks and then navigate sharp turns and narrow passageways studded with sharp rocks and flooded with muddy, zero-visibility water and debris. Experienced divers would lead them to the exit using ropes, usa today reports. But more heavy rain is in the forecast, which could cause water levels to rise further, threatening the safety of the air pocket. If the group does not swim out, they could be stuck in the cave for four months; the rainy season could last until october or november, and it will take time for the waters to recede. Two thai navy doctors have volunteered to stay with the boys for months in such a situation. Meanwhile, rescue teams are looking for another way into the cave that could provide an easier exit, officials are trying to reduce the risk of further flooding by pumping water from the cave system, and a phone line is being installed so the boys ' families can speak to them. Experts who spoke to usa today say the challenges facing the \" life or death \" operation are immense; while diving lines have been laid and air supplies ferried in, even the rescuers themselves are undertaking risky dives every time they swim to reach the boys.",

As for those who contend that the hot dog itself doesn't qualify as a filling, per the merriam-webster decree: \"if you choose to interpret filling narrowly as only ' a food mixture used to fill pastry or sandwiches, ' rather than broadly as'something used to fill a cavity, container, or depression,'then you're not going to allow any single-item filling to qualify a food item as a sandwich — which means there can be no thing as a peanut butter sandwich or a bologna ( or even baloney ) sandwich.

The washington post reports that trump's budget slashes medicaid by $ 800 billion over 10 years, meaning he's on board with the house vision to reverse former president obama's expansion of the program to pay for health care. The congressional budget office previously estimated such a cut would cause about 10 million people to lose benefits. Other items: food stamps: the plan cuts $ 193 billion from the supplemental nutrition assistance program, the modern version of food stamps, over the next 10 years, reports the ap. That's a cut of more than 25 %, one that would be achieved in part by tightening eligibility. The program serves about 44 million people, up from 28 million people in 2008. Critics say it's time to roll back the aid now that the financial crisis is over. Work requirements: trump plans to give states more flexibility in imposing work requirements for \" able-bodied \" people who collect a variety of anti-poverty benefits. Social security, medicare: these retirement benefits are safe from cuts, but axios reports that chip ( children's health insurance program ) and ssdi ( disability insurance ) are not. Cuts to federal pensions and farm subsidies also are in the works. The wall: trump's budget includes $ 1.6 billion for a wall along the mexican border, part of a $ 2.6 billion increase in border security, reports the hill. Balanced budget: the trump plan envisions a balanced budget in a decade, though that relies on a robust economic growth of 3 % and passage of the gop's obamacare alternative. From the left: \" the indications are strong this budget will feature robin-hood-in-reverse policies [ on ] an unprecedented scale, \" says robert greenstein of the center on budget and policy priorities. Counterpoint: ' we're not seeing the type of gains we should be seeing for all that spending, and that would suggest [ it's ] time to reform the system, \" says michael tanner of the libertarian cato institute. He was referring to an estimated $ 680 billion to $ 800 billion the us spends annually on anti-poverty programs.",

        "summary": "Research has suggested that uber and the like are helping to alleviate some of the discrimination that runs rampant among taxi drivers — but a new study involving roughly 1,500 trips in seattle and boston may be casting some rain on that parade. Published by the national bureau of economic research, the study out of mit and beyond put eight adults ( two black women, two black men, two white women, and two white men ) in seattle and had them attempt to hail rides using uber and lyft, as well as flywheel. Quartz describes a \" crucial \" difference in the process of securing a ride: lyft ride requests are accompanied by the would-be passenger's profile photo; uber drivers get passenger details once they've accepted the trip. It took black males longer to get their lyft ride request accepted as compared with their white counterparts, and the black passengers had to wait about 30 % longer for their uberx to show up, which suggested to the researchers that uber drivers may be canceling after gaining access to the specifics of the rider they're supposed to fetch. In boston, eight participants who could \" plausibly travel as a passenger of either race \" each created two profiles, which used \" white-sounding \" and \" african-american sounding \" names. The cancellation rate for the latter \" was more than twice as frequent, \" per the study. \" we found pretty strong evidence of discrimination, \" co-author christopher knittel tells cnnmoney. One suggestion the researchers have for the companies, per bloomberg: don't reveal passenger names to the drivers.",

Meanwhile, drivers also took female passengers for longer, more expensive rides. The findings stem from a research published on monday from professors at the massachusetts institute of technology, stanford university and the university of washington.

Participants captured information such as trip request and accepted time, actual pickup and drop off times.

She says during their session, weiner remarked she owed it to him to let him see her naked, a comment she just let fade before continuing to work on the script with him. But the months that followed left her feeling \" threatened and devalued, \" though she didn't report the incident because she says she wanted the writing credit for that episode to help get her another job. \" i saw no value to speaking out, \" she says. \" so i did what i thought women were supposed to do. \" she says she \" lost respect \" for weiner, and a longtime writer on the show tells the information \" i could see her confidence was shaken \" after the incident. Just weeks after her emmy win, weiner let gordon go, rattling off a list of ways she'd \" fallen short \" on the job, she says. In a statement from his rep, weiner says he spent \" eight to 10 hours a day \" holed up working with gordon, but he notes he doesn't remember making that remark and insists he had \" a predominantly female driven writers room [ and ] has long believed in and implemented an egalitarian working environment. \" gordon fell out of hollywood after that and went on instead to found modern alliance, a nonprofit for sexual harassment victims.

The delta fire erupted wednesday afternoon and within hours had devoured nearly 8 square miles of timber and brush on both sides of interstate 5 north of redding near the oregon state line. The blaze was human-caused, fire officials said, but they didn't indicate whether it was arson or accident. Truckers abandoned their vehicles as flames roared up hillsides. In a video, a passenger in a vehicle screams: \" oh my god, i want to go! \" as trees burst into flames and sheets of fire roiled on the side of the roadway. About 17 big-rigs were abandoned and at least four caught fire, lt. Cmdr. Kyle foster of the california highway patrol's mount shasta office tells the los angeles times. Us forest service workers helped the driver of one flaming truck to safety and other truckers, firefighters, and others aided additional drivers, he said. \" there's vehicles scattered all over, \" fire official brandon vaccaro tells the redding record searchlight. \" whatever occurred here was probably pretty ugly for a while. \" about 45 miles of the i-5 remained closed in both directions through wednesday night and there was no immediate word on when the lanes would reopen.

Centralmaine.com reports 27-year-old desiree strout was driving on us route 2 in skowhegan monday morning with her husband, 29-year-old harry weeks, and their 8-year-old daughter ( their other daughter, 2, wasn't with them ), headed to a local hospital so she could be medically induced into labor. That's when, just 5 miles from their destination, strout hit the stretch of black ice and lost control of the car, which slid into a bank of frozen snow on the roadside, then rolled and tipped onto its side on an iced-over pond, david bucknam, chief of the skowhegan police department, tells people. Emergency responders tried to resuscitate strout at the edge of the pond, but to no avail; she's said to have died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Weeks ended up in critical condition with a punctured lung and torn liver, while their daughter suffered minor injuries. In a sliver of good news, strout's baby boy was delivered by emergency c-section and was initially said to be in critical condition; his updated status after being moved to a bangor hospital hasn't been divulged.

That bartender called police, who arrested purinton, 51, shortly after midnight thursday and charged him with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. Police say purinton opened fire on srinivas kuchibhotla and alok madasani, both 32, at a bar in olathe, kan., on wednesday, killing kuchibhotla. He allegedly yelled, \" get out of my country. \" a third man, 24-year-old ian grillot, says he was shot in the chest and hand as he tried to subdue the shooter. Purinton — described by neighbors as a recluse and alcoholic, per kshb — had earlier been kicked out of the bar in olathe for shouting racial slurs at kuchibhotla and madasani, both garmin engineers, but returned with a gun and opened fire, witnesses say. In a video released by a hospital, grillot says he initially hid under a table but tried to subdue the shooter after nine shots were fired. \" i didn't want the gentleman to potentially go after somebody else, \" he says. \" i was told i was incredibly lucky \" to have survived. He adds it was \" the greatest thing \" when madasani, released from a hospital on thursday, came to visit him. Purinton, meanwhile, awaits extradition to kansas. Police say he could face additional charges as they investigate whether the shooting constitutes a hate crime.",

Emily cho, a senior vp of korean air, has apologized after an outburst during a meeting in which she threw water, or perhaps a water bottle, at or near a subordinate in a fit of anger, reports reuters. Cho, also known as cho hyun-min, is the daughter of airline chairman cho yang-ho. But the reason the incident is generating so many headlines is because cho also is the sister of heather cho, she of the infamous \" nut rage \" incident of 2014. In that one, heather cho forced a taxiing korean air jet to return to the gate because she had been served nuts in a bag instead of a bowl, and she wanted the chief flight attendant kicked off. Heather cho not only lost her executive post at the airline, she was sentenced to a year in jail for endangering aviation safety. The details of emily cho's outburst are less clear, but the chosunilbo reports that she threw a water bottle in the face of an employee of an ad firm that was doing work for the airline. The ap reports that she threw a cup of water, and the airline maintains that cho pushed it on the floor, not toward the staffer's face. \"as i was focusing on my passion for the work, i was unable to control my thoughtless words and deeds, through which i caused injury and disappointment for a lot of people, \" said cho, who has been suspended from her airline post overseeing ads and marketing.

As for everest, he had previously conquered it.

The washington post notes it took four days to climb to the exit point, where the temperature was zero degrees fahrenheit. The jump was one that took rozov two years to prepare for and set a record that he broke three years later when jumping from mount cho oyu along the china-nepal border at an even higher 25,250 feet. As for what took the 52-year-old's life on saturday, the himalayan times quotes someone with ties to his expedition as saying he crashed into a cliff during a jump. His body was reportedly recovered by helicopter the next day. Red bull, which had partnered with rozov since 2004, notes that he leaves behind a wife and sons.

        "summary": "As the outrage against dentist and lion-killer walter palmer simmers, the washington post points out that he's far from the only american hunter to kill a lion in africa. In fact, hundreds do so every year in legal hunts. Palmer's problem is that his guides lured a lion out of a protected area. Conversation groups estimate that at least 600 lions are killed annually by hunters looking for a trophy kill. And most of those hunters — 64 % by the most recent estimate — are from the us. One contributing factor, explains the post, is that the us considers lions \" threatened, \" a lesser label than \" endangered, \" which would prevent hunters from bringing back their \" lion trophies. \" palmer belongs to the hunting group safari club international, which extols the thrill of a lion hunt: \" virtually anyone who imagines an african safari envisions the big maned lion charging the implacable hunter shouldering his european double rifle. \" of course, that's a far cry from how such lions usually get killed, and how palmer killed his. It remains unclear whether palmer will face charges, but the minneapolis star tribune reports that federal officials are investigating and are prepared to help zimbabwe's investigation. Police, meanwhile, have increased patrols around his office in bloomington. ( jimmy kimmel has a suggestion for how people can channel their outrage productively. )",

In august, scientists announced they had found a greenland canyon that dwarfs the famed one in arizona. Now, researchers have repeated the feat — and then some — in the antarctic. Phys.org reports that a group of uk scientists used satellites and radar to study the ellsworth subglacial highlands, an ancient mountain range buried under more than a mile of ice in west antarctica. What they found: a mammoth valley almost 1.9 miles deep in places, now named the ellsworth trough. As gizmodo points out, that's much deeper than the grand canyon, which is up to a mile deep. The discovery of the canyon, which measures nearly 200 miles long and up to 15 miles wide, beneath so much ice was a find that lead author dr. Neil ross describes as \" incredibly serendipitous. \" while the team had data from both ends of the trough from ice-penetrating radar, they didn't know what existed between, and had to rely on nasa satellite data to fill that hole — or, as it were, uncover one. Because, as ross explains, even beneath all that ice, \" the valley is so vast that it can be seen from space. \" he adds, \" to me, this just goes to demonstrate how little we still know about the surface of our own planet. \" ( click for more on the canyon found in greenland, which is grander than the grand canyon in one regard. )",

The research involved scientists from newcastle university, the university of bristol's glaciology centre, the british antarctic survey and the universities of edinburgh, exeter, and york. They charted the ellsworth subglacial highlands – an ancient mountain range buried beneath several kilometres of antarctic ice - by combining data from satellites and ice-penetrating radars towed behind skidoos and on-board small aircraft. The researchers spent three seasons investigating and mapping the region in west antarctica, uncovering a massive subglacial valley up to 3 kilometres deep, more than 300 kilometres long and up to 25 kilometres across. In places, the floor of this valley is more than 2000 metres below sea level.

( if you don't want to listen to the hour-long retraction, which is a masterpiece of the form, the transcript is available here. ) daisey has attempted to defend his actions, using an end-justifies-the-means argument: what i do is not journalism. The tools of the theater are not the same as the tools of journalism. For this reason, i regret that i allowed this american life to air an excerpt from my monologue. This american life is essentially a journalistic ­- not a theatrical ­- enterprise, and as such it operates under a different set of rules and expectations. But this is my only regret.

And the amount of plastic amassing on the ocean surface, in sea ice, and possibly even on the ocean floor is only expected to increase as melting ice enables travel to the area, researchers write in a study published in science advances, per the new york times. The consequences of the pollution are not yet fully understood, but \" the problem with plastic specifically being in the arctic is that it's going to get into the food chain of animals that are very much under threat already, that are struggling to survive in a changing climate, \" study author erik van sebille tells the verge. The plastic was found during research missions to 42 sites around the north pole in 2013. No plastic was found at a third of the sites, but there was a \" hotspot of very, very polluted waters \" in the greenland and barents seas north of norway, where sites had between 100 tons and 1,200 tons of plastic, van sebille says. The whole area only contains about 3 % of the estimated 110 million tons of plastic in our oceans, but that figure is still high considering the area's remoteness. According to a release, researchers believe the plastic traveled to the arctic on currents from the north atlantic and originated in the uk, europe, and north america.

Texas has filed a lawsuit to prevent the refugees — a man named tamman, his wife, their two young children, and his parents — from being resettled in the state, reports the houston chronicle. The lawsuit, which names the federal government as well as the international rescue committee nonprofit, says state officials have not been consulted about the resettlement or given enough information on background checks, the texas tribune reports. Texas is one of around 30 states trying to block syrian refugees, which president obama says they don't have the legal authority to do. Texas first threatened the lawsuit days ago, arguing that under federal law, the resettlement group is required to cooperate with the state. Aid worker anne marie weiss-armush tells the chronicle that two dallas-area apartments have already been obtained for the family, who have a relative that was resettled in texas earlier this year and now works at walmart. \" it's kind of nerve-wrecking because it really is a test case, \" she says. \" it's like, is gov.

The storm poses a small, manageable threat to satellites, power grids, and other high-tech hardware, and could cause some spectacular displays of light and color, the la times reports. The national oceanic and atmospheric administration first detected the flare late sunday, followed by a coronal mass ejection, which hurled billions of plasma particles toward earth at uncommonly fast speeds. The first radiation from the flare hit earth within hours, but the plasma is expected to arrive at about 9am today, potentially knocking out some gps systems and power grids. Some flights were rerouted around polar regions yesterday as a precaution. Though such flares can expose astronauts to deadly radiation, nasa has indicated that this one won't, according to the huffington post. Of course, the fun part is that this might produce spectacular light displays tonight. A similar, weaker flare in the same part of the sun on thursday produced such auroras this weekend, and you can see amazing photos of them here.",

So he underwent mri scans, which showed serious activity in his brain's left hemisphere ( which is key to math skills ), particularly the parietal cortex, where the brain integrates data from different senses. So do we all have such skills lying dormant? probably, according to an expert who oversaw padget's mri scans: \" it would be quite a coincidence \" otherwise, he says.

        "summary": "Costco inadvertently undermined the golf industry and sent golfers into a frenzy when it introduced its own kirkland signature line of golf balls last fall, the wall street journal reports. South korea's nassau golf, which makes golf balls for a major golf equipment company taylormade, decided to sell some of its leftover balls to costco. Costco, being costco, slapped a kirkland signature logo on the balls and sold them for $ 29.99 for two-dozen — one of the cheapest prices for golf balls anywhere. That would've probably been the end of it, except golfers started realizing the balls performed as well as higher-end golf balls, such as the titleist pro v1, which sells for $ 4 per ball. Cbs sports blames what happened next on a combination of an \" insane wave of marketing and good publicity \" and golfers ' \" fanatical mindset \" about their equipment. The kirkland signature balls flew off costco shelves and have been almost entirely sold out for the past two months. They can, however, be found going for double their retail price on ebay or in the golf bags of people with costco \" connections. \" as expected, this has not been welcome news for taylormade, and nassau golf now says it will no longer be selling leftover balls in such high quantities. That means it's unclear if the kirkland signature balls will ever again be widely available at costco.",

Here is the wall street journal: the balls have been out of stock for much of the past two months, save for a few fleeting spurts of availability. Within the past week, costco removed the listing for them from its website. It is unclear when or even if they will be in stock again. \" we don't have a certain amount that we promise to deliver to costco, \" said shim kwang-suk, executive director at nassau's ball plant in korea. \" we produce other products first and deliver to costco if we have products left. \" so that's pretty interesting. Meanwhile, the balls continue to sell at titleist prov1-like figures on ebay. This remains a fascinating phenomenon to me. There is no more rabid industry than the golf equipment industry, and that fanatical mindset seems to be fueling a lot of the intrigue here. And now costco has decided to eject because their ball supplier in korea doesn't really care about meeting their demand? that seems odd. But it also might not be over as one kirkland signature believer told the wsj. William stalsworth, a 61-year-old retiree living in naples, fla., said an employee at a nearby costco store recently told him the balls would be back in stock this spring.

        "summary": "President trump appeared to break from royal protocol friday during an official visit to the uk when he seemed to step in front of queen elizabeth ii. For a few moments, mr. Trump walked just ahead of her majesty while the pair inspected the queen's honor guard, per the new york times. In footage of the event, trump seems to then stop, thus cutting off the queen and forcing her to slightly pivot around him. The move elicited a flurry of condemnation on social media, as well as uk headlines blasting trump's conduct, such as metro's \" donald trump walking in front of the queen will make you rage. \" as the times notes, mr. Trump and first lady melania trump may have broken with protocol earlier in the trip when they both declined to curtsy or bow to the queen. Trump's meeting with the queen followed an arguably more controversial meeting with uk prime minister theresa may, after which the president dressed down the british leader's handling of brexit because, as he said, she declined to follow his advice on the matter. As trump now settles in for several days of work, relaxation and golf at his resort in scotland ahead of a much ballyhooed meeting with valdimir putin, some 10,000 demonstrators took to the streets in the country's capital of edinburgh on saturday to protest the american president and his policies. Trump is due to meet with the russian leader in helsinki on monday, just days after news hit that twelve russian intelligence officers have been indicted on charges they hacked into democratic email accounts during the 2016 us presidential election.",

The document proposes keeping britain and the eu in a free market for goods, with a more distant relationship for services. The plan has infuriated fervent brexit supporters, who think sticking close to the bloc would limit britain's ability to strike new trade deals around the world.

Montgomery county judge kathleen hamilton issued the sentence to the 56-year-old houston man on tuesday after he had pleaded guilty last week to the ninth dwi, a may 2015 accident in which he smashed into a car driven by the 16-year-old son of montgomery county cop rowdy hayden, cbs news reports. After the crash, middleton — who authorities say veered out of his lane while trying to make a turn at a stop sign — reportedly fled the scene and tried to get a convenience store clerk to hide him; his bac was said to be 0.184, more than double the legal limit, per the montgomery county police reporter. He's already spent four other stints in prison for alcohol-related convictions, and ktrk documents all of his other dwi charges, starting with his first in 1980 when he was 20, per harris county court documents. The mcpr notes middleton testified during the punishment phase of his trial on tuesday and said he had been teased in school and started drinking when he was a high school freshman. His sister says their dad had been a drinker until the night he met their mom ( and then never touched a drop again ). And middleton's girlfriend even took the stand, noting she thought he could be rehabilitated and that he could easily give up driving because he didn't like it anyway. But the judge was obviously swayed by middleton's apparent lack of remorse for hitting joshua hayden ( who survived ), as well as for his prior dwis, and issued the life sentence. Rowdy hayden thinks middleton's sentence is more than appropriate. \" for a habitual offender like this, he's proven that he cannot be rehabilitated, \" he tells ktrk. \" and he should spend the rest of his life in prison. \" ( middleton isn't the first texan to get life for drunk driving. )",

And why should he? he spoke his truth, and its refrain rang familiar to more than a few of us who have lived in the city, spent time here for college, or still call the hub home. Those who agree with and defend che, have had to endure, on social media and talk radio, too much whitesplaining that boston can't be racist if white people don't see it.

One of the researchers says the reason many people believe psychedelic drugs and psychosis are linked may be because a relatively large number of people suffer psychosis, and since psychedelics are \" psychologically intense, \" many people \" will blame anything that happens for the rest of their lives on a psychedelic experience. \" a second study published in the journal of psychopharmacology using similar data not only didn't find a link between psychedelic drugs and mental-health conditions, it found that users were actually less likely to suffer psychological distress or suicidal thoughts and a lot less likely to attempt suicide, raw story reports.

Wales tells the guardian that wikipedia itself is \" not a perfect place, \" but he adds it also hasn't been overrun by fake news. \" if there is any kryptonite to false information, it's transparency, \" wales recently wrote in the guardian.

Christopher lucas ( who also goes by christophe, according to various sources ) and his wife, jennie chang, were sampling inside for about an hour, restaurant staff said in the police report, and one of their smartphones — which they say they left in the car with an open connection so they could monitor the children — had had an open line for 58 minutes, the post notes. Lucas reportedly came outside as police tried to figure out how to get the kids out of the volvo. \" i left to go inside... But i was watching them, \" he told cops, as per wusa. \" the children were sleeping. \" lucas, said in court docs to be a software engineer, and chang, employed by the fda, reportedly live in a $ 1 million rowhouse near dupont circle. They were arrested for attempted second-degree child cruelty, which carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence and up to $ 10,000 in fines. The kids are ok, the post notes, and with dc child services. A woman who lives near where the car was found tells wjla, \" it's the same thing if you leave your kids in a hot car in the summer.
