He, maura's older siblings, and others have been tracking the case \" with the intensity of nuclear fusion. \" they're hoping, even all these years later, that a clue will emerge to bring some closure as to what happened to maura, who \" vanished in what seemed like a blink of an eye, \" an ex-littleton cop says. Per the globe and caledonian record, maura, a university of massachusetts amherst nursing student, had emailed at least one professor on feb. 9, 2004, to say there had been a death in her family ( there hadn't ) and that she was taking time off. She reportedly took nearly $ 300 out of her bank account and was driving toward the white mountains when her car apparently hit a curve and ended up in a snowbank. A school bus driver came by and asked maura if she needed assistance, but she said she was ok. The driver called the cops anyway, but when they got there minutes later, there was no sign of her — including no footprints and no viable scent police dogs could pick up. Cops say wine bottles were found in her car, with indications she'd been drinking on her drive. Her family has no clue where she would've been going or why. \" the likely scenario is that she got picked up by someone, \" her brother, fred, tells the globe, with his sister julie adding, \" i want some answers for my dad's sake. … thirteen years is long enough.

        "summary": "A month after mohamed morsi was driven from power in egypt, three leading muslim brotherhood figures face an impending trial. A cairo court ruling yesterday will send brotherhood supreme guide mohammed badie, deputy khairat al-shater, and top official mohamed bayoumi to court on aug. 25 for allegedly inciting the killing of rioters outside the organization's headquarters. Badie's arrest marked the first for a brotherhood supreme guide since 1981, the new york times notes. The trial could mark an effort to shut down continuing protests by brotherhood backers, including a pair of sit-ins, says an expert, adding that some opponents see it as an \" opportunity to destroy the brotherhood. \" meanwhile, demonstrations continue, with thousands of morsi supporters taking to the streets in a cairo march today, reuters reports. \" we are not terrorists, \" they chanted as they called for the former leader's reinstatement. Security forces didn't move to halt the protest, but a government helicopter dropped literature at the sit-ins urging protesters to leave. Sens.

        "summary": "President trump has long contended that \" millions \" of illegal voters marred the november election, despite no evidence to support that belief, and the commission he's approved to shake out voter fraud has been hitting some roadblocks. The latest obstacle: the presidential advisory commission on election integrity may have broken the law in its request for nationwide voter data, the hill reports. The commission's letter sent to all 50 states and dc apparently didn't go through the office of information and regulatory affairs, required of all federal agencies making requests for public information. More on that and related stories: not following the oira process would be a violation of the paperwork reduction act, though some say the commission isn't technically an agency and doesn't fall under the law's purview. Others disagree. \" i think it shows a carelessness in their desire to come in and … do what they want and to do so with a disregard for the rules, \" rutgers university professor stuart shapiro says. So far, 44 states and the district of columbia ( the nation counts 45 states ) have said they can't ( or won't ) turn over certain portions of the requested info, with some saying they won't provide any, per cnn and other sources. The washington post dives into why this mass rebuff is happening as states figure out what they can legally make available. The story notes that \" partial data could make it all largely worthless or misleading \" in trying to put together a \" national picture. \" kris kobach, the kansas secretary of state who's the vice chair of the commission, put out an official white house statement wednesday blasting the \" fake news \" that 44 states have \" refused \" to hand over voter info. Per kobach's numbers, 20 states \" have agreed to provide the publicly available information requested by the commission, \" with another 16 mulling what data they're legally allowed to release — meaning just 14 states and dc have outright said no to the commission. Kobach doesn't categorize specific states in his remarks. One of commission member thinks the backlash coming to this request for voters ' personal info, which includes party affiliations and partial social security numbers, should have been obvious. \" the fullness of experience being what it is, we should have predicted it, \" maine secretary of state matthew dunlap tells mic. The nation, which counts the trump administration's initiative as a major move toward \" voter suppression, \" says the mission is \" backfiring badly, \" with \" strong opposition \" from gop",

Bailey never emerged, and the marshall county high school principal approached bailey's parents and officials broke the news.

        "summary": "The european central bank today cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point to.75 %, its lowest level yet, in a move the new york times describes as the ecb's \" most aggressive \" since the eurozone crisis hit. Though the move was widely expected, it does bring the benchmark rate to what was once considered the lower bound on the official rate. The action will make it cheaper for businesses and consumers to take loans. In a second, more surprising, move, the ecb also cut by a quarter-point the interest rate it pays banks on overnight deposits, bringing that to zero and giving banks reason to lend the money, rather than sock it away with the ecb. The times notes that the moves leave the ecb with few crisis-combating tools left. The next step would probably involve a massive bond-buying spree, which could anger germany because it doesn't want to get stuck bearing the brunt of any losses the ecb could suffer on its bond holdings. Today's other major rate news comes from china: the ap reports the people's bank of china cut its main lending rate by 0.31 points to 6 % and reduced its deposit rate by a quarter-point to 3 %, moves analysts believe hint at deepening economic concern.",

        "summary": "Obamacare is \" dead, \" president trump declared after the house narrowly passed the american health care act thursday — but before he can sign the death warrant, a bigger battle looms in the senate. Republican senators say they're going to craft their own obamacare replacement bill, and with the chamber divided 52-48, they're going to have to come up with something senators with views as different as ted cruz, susan collins, rob portman, and rand paul can all agree on. A roundup of coverage: republican senators have made it clear that they plan to write their own legislation instead of rubber-stamping the house bill, and they say they're going to take as long as they need, politico reports. \" any bill that has been posted less than 24 hours... Needs to be viewed with suspicion, \" said sen. Lindsey graham, while sen. Bob corker said he \" turned the volume off some time ago \" and has no idea \" what the house is even passing. \" a big sticking point will be medicaid expansion, with senators from states that expanded the program under obamacare fighting rollback efforts, the hill reports. Nevada's sen. Dean heller and ohio's sen. Rob portman are among those who've said they cannot support the house bill in its current form. The washington post reports that other wild cards include moderate gop sens. Susan collins and bill cassidy, who've already introduced an alternative plan, and the conservative trio of sens. Ted cruz, rand paul, and mike lee, who, like the house freedom caucus, favor an aggressive repeal of obamacare. Republicans plan to get their bill through the senate through budget reconciliation to avoid a filibuster to pass it with a simple majority, though democrats warn that parts of the house bill violate the budget rules involved, the new york times reports. \" this bill is going nowhere fast in the united states senate, \" minority leader chuck schumer said, telling republicans they \" should refuse to follow their house colleagues over a cliff, reject repeal, and work with democrats to improve our health care system in a bipartisan way. \" some analysts predict that the senate will be ready to vote on its bill by summertime, but senators have declined to provide a timeline. \" when we get 51 senators, we ' ll vote, \" said sen. John cornyn. Reuters reports that unlike house lawmakers, senators will be waiting for health care legislation to be scored by the congressional budget office before they vote on it.

            "Ever since back to the future part ii came out and tickled my fanciful soul with the nike air mag, i've been waiting to get my hands on a pair. They're finally real and oh my god they're so dreaaamy. Advertisement the upper of the shoe is made of reinforced mesh. The outer sole is lined with led panels that ' ll light up just like all futuristic shoes imagined in the 80's should ( we're not talking corny la gear shoes here, people ). The air mag is rechargeable and will stay lit for 5 hours. There's also a electroluminescent nike logo in the strap. It's pretty much the exact replica of the pair of shoes marty mcfly famously wore with a few slight tweaks to add more support and comfort. Here's the great news about the back to the future nikes: they're being made for a great cause as the proceeds will go to the michael j. Fox foundation in the hopes of finding a cure for parkinson's disease. The less good news? well, in the larger scope of things, there isn't any bad news. Parkinson's is a terrible disease and benefiting the search for a cure is always a good thing. For sneakerheads looking to score the shoe of their lifetime though, the air mags is going to be really hard to come by as only 1500 pairs will be made. Even harder is that each pair will be put up for auction on ebay. The auction starts tonight at 11: 30 est at nikemag.ebay.com. Advertisement crushing the far-fetched dream of wearing 2015 technology on your feet though, the shoes won't be power lacing. That's okay! everything else about the shoe is as beautiful as when i first fell in love with it. And who knows what ' ll happen when it's actually 2015? michael j.

Yesterday, the actor commissioned a skywriter to write \" i am sorry daniel clowes \" in the skies over los angeles, according to the hollywood reporter, which has a photo. Clowes is the graphic novelist whose comic labeouf is accused of plagiarizing. Most of labeouf's previous apologies to clowes were also plagiarized, but this one appears to use labeouf's own words, the reporter notes. On new year's eve, labeouf addressed the plagiarized apologies on twitter, starting off by tweeting, \" 2014 resolution - i need to work on being a less controversial tweeter. \" he then wrote: \" i am sorry for all the plagiarized tweets, they all were unintelligent, ambiguous and needlessly hurtful.... You have my apologies for offending you for thinking i was being serious instead of accurately realizing i was mocking you. \" but, uh, all three of those new year's eve tweets were also lifted from others ' words, celebitchy notes. Then, in case we weren't all confused enough, labeouf tweeted today: \" i am not a biter. I ' m a writer for myself and others. I steal some plot points &amp; dialogue.

        "summary": "Authorities have identified the suicide bomber at ariana grande's manchester concert as 22-year-old salman abedi. The telegraph reports that he is a manchester native, though his parents are from libya and are believed to have fled the regime of moammar gadhafi. Uk intelligence officials are now trying to figure out the big question: was he a lone wolf or did he get help? isis has claimed responsibility for the attack, and police have arrested another suspect in connection with it, though it could be awhile before it's clear what, if any, connections abedi had with them. Coverage: 8 years old: the youngest victim among the 22 fatalities appears to have been saffie rose roussos, who was just 8. She \" was simply a beautiful little girl in every aspect of the word, \" says the head teacher at her school, per nbc news. Another victim was a college student previously pictured with ariana grande. Bogus reports: in the immediate aftermath of the bombing, a slew of false stories began circulating online. Buzzfeed debunks them, including one about a supposed gunman outside a hospital. More kids: the bbc has a q&a on what's known about the attack so far. One detail: of the 59 injured, 12 are under the age of 16. Chosen target? this looks like \" an attack on girls and women, \" declares the headline on a post by christina cauterucci at slate. Grande's \" global brand is one of blissful, unsubdued feminine sexuality, \" and her audience reflects that, writes cauterucci. The bombing is a \" massive act of gender-based violence. \" what it was like: the new york times has a detailed scene story based on the accounts of those who attended the concert, including at least one who thinks security checks were a little loose. Still missing: families were still trying to track down missing loved ones, and the manchester evening news has their pleas and photos. One happy ending: social media helped track down a 16-year-old girl missing after the show, and abc news has the details. The girl's distinctive yellow top helped strangers find her at a local hotel. Hopeful thought: stephen king, no stranger to horror, had this to say about the terror group on twitter: \" isis: a rogue cult that has substituted superstition and murder for spirituality. Every bombing hastens the day when they will be no more. \" crowdfunding: the manchester evening news has set up a crowdfunding campaign for victims ' families. It had raised more than $ 620,000 by 1pm et on tuesday.",

        "summary": "The fight to keep asian carp from colonizing the great lakes could take longer than any war america has ever fought, the army corps of engineers warns in a report commissioned by congress. The report offered eight strategies to keep the invasive species from overwhelming the ecosystem and ruining a $ 7 billion fishing industry, the most effective of which could take up to 25 years and cost around $ 18 billion, the christian science monitor reports. Physical separation of the mississippi watershed from lake michigan was the most drastic option, but the army engineers also looked at methods including new locks and electronic barriers to keep out the carp and other invasive species. The $ 18 billion plan may be a tough sell, but environmentalists fear that cheaper options won't be enough to keep the carp out. \" if you really want to prevent the movement of species and keep lake michigan clean, it's going to cost money, \" the president of the alliance for the great lakes tells the chicago tribune. \" we can't just keep patching over these problems and hoping they go away. \"",

According to an in-depth analysis of rhymes in billboard's top 100 songs for that period, simple rhymes with words like be, me, to, and you are the most common, and half of the top 20 rhymes include either you or me ( before you cringe, shakespeare favored it in his sonnets with me/thee ). It's fascinating to click on slate's graph and see how certain rhymes have risen and fallen in popularity. Do/you topped out in 1998-99 with songs like aerosmith's \" i don't want to miss a thing \" and britney spears ' \"... Baby one more time, \" while cry/goodbye was more popular in the 1960s with elvis presley's \" marie's the name \" and marty robbins ' \" don't worry about me. \" occasionally an artist or group comes along ( like queen ) that rarely re-uses a rhyme, while most ( like bieber ) keep drawing on the most popular ones.

That turns out to be bieber's favorite pair of words to rhyme: in his still-young career, he's used the pair in 12 different songs. It's also the beatles ' favorite rhyme — and the favorite rhyme of prince, whitney houston, adele, the rolling stones, madonna, elton john, bob dylan, and kanye west.

            "This month marks 50 years since the beatles made landfall in america. Had it not been for a very fortuitous convergence of events, however, beatlemania might never have erupted. After refusing to release previous beatles hits such as \"she loves you \" and \"please please me \" ( both went to number one in the uk ) capitol records finally decided that \"i want to hold your hand \" might have a chance in the us. Advertisement advertisement beatles manager brian epstein had already booked the band for three consecutive weeks as headliners on ed sullivan's sunday night variety show, so when the new single went to number one in the u.s. At the end of january only days before the band were to appear on national television, the timing could not have been better. Fifty years from now, the recounting of the 'beatlemania ' phenomenon will merely provide colorful context; it is primarily the music and the changes it provoked that will endure. That february 9 broadcast turned out to be a historic moment in pop music culture and the beatles went on to become one of the most successful acts -- commercially and critically -- in the history of popular music. Fifty years later how important have the beatles turned out to be? and 50 years from now will anybody care about the fab four? the answer depends. In our era"

Less had been known about this concentration camp's chambers, which were razed by the nazis along with the rest of the site following a prisoner uprising in 1943, the jerusalem post reports. A road was later built over the camp's remains, and archaeologists searching beneath it uncovered rows of bricks that they believe demarcate what one archaeologist involved in the dig says were eight chambers, reuters reports. \" we were amazed at the size of the building and the well-preserved condition of the chamber walls, \" says a second archaeologist, whose relatives were killed at sobibor. Being able to determine the size of the chambers is a big win for researchers, who say it will enable them to more accurately determine how many people were killed at the camp; current estimates put the figure at 250,000. As the telegraph explains, sobibor was not a work camp like, for example, auschwitz; all prisoners who arrived here were sent to the gas chambers. As such, few survivor stories exist. In addition to the chambers, a well containing prisoners ' personal items discarded by the nazis was also found. The archaeologists also surfaced a wedding ring bearing a hebrew inscription reading, \" behold, you are consecrated unto me. \" ( there was another very significant find at sobibor this summer. )",

Per syracuse.com, the \" bone treats \" dog owners pick up in the supermarket or pet store could be a health hazard for our four-legged friends. This is based on reports submitted to the fda that indicate about 90 dogs have been sickened, with at least 15 deaths, after gnawing on these commercially prepared items, which the agency didn't id by brand. The reports, sent in by both pet owners and veterinarians, said some of the medical issues have included digestive blockages, choking, diarrhea, vomiting, and cuts and other injuries in the mouth. Seven reports focused on product issues: treats that splintered upon being chewed as well as \" moldy-appearing bones. \" \" we recommend supervising your dog with any chew toy or treat, especially one she hasn't had before, \" an fda veterinarian says in the agency's warning. The agency notes these types of treats differ from regular bones in that they're often baked or smoked to dry them out, and that they may contain seasonings, preservatives, and \" smoke flavorings. \" but it's not just store-bought bone treats dog owners should be wary of. The fda warning says it's also important to keep pups away from chicken bones and other bones you may have cooked with, as they can cause injury as well. The notice advises to keep food dishes out of reach of curious canines sniffing around the table, as well as to make sure they don't get into the trash to dig any bones out.",

        "summary": "Judge judy's newly released testimony in a legal dispute between her network ( cbs ) and a talent agency is just about as awesome as you'd expect from the outspoken jurist. The dispute itself has quite a few ins and outs, with vulture summing it up nicely: the talent agency gets 5 % of judge judy's net profits, but only after cbs pays judy her $ 47 million salary, so it's claiming to be underpaid; cbs, meanwhile, says the talent agency is actually overpaid since it had nothing to do with the creation or production of the show beyond representing three of the show's early producers. But judy's testimony from 2016, which was just obtained by the hollywood reporter and published for the first time, is a must-read. In it, she describes her negotiation process with cbs every few years, which isn't actually a negotiation at all — it's just judy getting what she wants. Her contract allows her to produce the show herself if she so desires, she explains in the testimony, and if she did that she'd actually make $ 20 million more. She doesn't, because \" i like the uncomplicated life i lead, \" but the option is always there. So when it's negotiation time, she sits down with a cbs exec for dinner and hands him an envelope with her demands ( salary and otherwise ), and each time those demands are met. The one year a different exec tried to hand her his own envelope, she refused to even look at it because \" this isn't a negotiation, \" as she told him. \" ' you want [ the show ], fine. Otherwise, i ' ll produce it myself.'that's the negotiation. \" she added that cbs has \" no choice but to pay me what i [ want ] \" and that the network's \" back [ is ] to the wall, \" because \" they've tried to find another judy, \" but they can't.

Ods involving common anxiety drugs like xanax and valium are at an all-time high, and scientists fear plenty of lives will be lost before they fully understand why. In a new study, researchers found that prescriptions for benzodiazepines — used to treat anxiety, mood disorders, and insomnia in more than 5 % of us adults — tripled from 1996 to 2013, while overdoses quadrupled, reports nbc news. In 2013, \" benzos \" played a role in 31 % of the nation's 22,000 prescription overdose deaths, reports stat. Seeing the rise in ods outpace the rise in prescriptions suggests \" people have been taking them in a riskier way over time, \" says lead author marcus bachhuber. One theory is that the spike in deaths is linked to higher doses — the amount of benzodiazepine in prescriptions doubled over the study period, notes cnn. It's also possible that people are taking them carelessly along with alcohol or opioids, in which case their \" lethality is magnified, \" says a doctor not involved with the study. The death rate plateaued among white people, the largest users of benzos, between 2010 and 2013, but it rose among black and hispanic people in that same span. The authors caution that benzodiazepines are being over-prescribed in general and suggest doctors should look into alternatives drugs or treatments such as talk therapy.",

Benzodiazepines are a class of medication with sedative properties that are prescribed for anxiety, insomnia and other conditions. The potential danger of benzodiazepines is no secret: they were involved in about 30 % of prescription drug overdose deaths in 2013, second only to opioids, which were involved in 70 % of overdose deaths, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. Researchers were hopeful that the last few years might see a decrease in benzodiazepine prescriptions. \" going into this study, we thought that prescribing would be steady or decline in the late 2000s [ because ] people became more aware of opioids so there might be more attention \" to benzodiazepines, said dr.

            "( cnn ) the use of benzodiazepines, such as xanax and valium, is on the rise, and the number of overdose deaths related to them soared in recent years, new research says. Benzodiazepines are a class of medication with sedative properties that are prescribed for anxiety, insomnia and other conditions. The potential danger of benzodiazepines is no secret: they were involved in about 30 % of prescription drug overdose deaths in 2013, second only to opioids, which were involved in 70 % of overdose deaths, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. Researchers were hopeful that the last few years might see a decrease in benzodiazepine prescriptions. \" going into this study, we thought that prescribing would be steady or decline in the late 2000s [ because ] people became more aware of opioids so there might be more attention \" to benzodiazepines, said dr. Marcus a. Bachhuber,",

Eight days ago, residents of duxbury, mass., found a box giving off a strong smell — and inside discovered a man whose torso had been cut open with a 14-inch incision. Reports suggest that the man, estuardo perez of guatemala, had been a drug mule. Now prosecutors have charged another guatemalan, jose azurdia-montenegro, 55, with misleading a police investigation into the case. Using a local resident's cellphone records, investigators tracked azurdia-montenegro and stopped him before he could board a flight at jfk airport on saturday, an assistant da tells the boston globe. Azurdia-montenegro initially said he'd just met the victim, but his attorney now says the two were visiting the us to buy cars for resale in guatemala, the boston herald reports. Yet azurdia-montenegro insists he knows nothing of the murder, and authorities say a third man may be involved. Grim detail: the incision on perez's body was a \" careful cut to the stomach, presumably to access the contents of the stomach, \" says the assistant da.",

So says a new study in the national bureau of economic research, which found that short guys, defined as those shorter than 5-foot-7, are about 18 % less likely to marry than their taller counterparts, but when they do, they divorce at lower rates — to the tune of 32 % lower, reports the new republic. Divorce rates for tall and average guys, meanwhile, are basically the same. \" this probably means that women who don't want to be in a relationship with short men are more likely to leave before they get married, rather than after, \" one researcher tells the washington post. Or more simply: \" there's something distinct about the women who marry short men. \" but it's not quite clear what's distinct, because shorter men appear to be the heavyweights in the relationship: their partners tend to be younger, less educated women, who earn less than they do. Some 78 % of short men out-earn their partners, as opposed to 69 % of average and 71 % of tall men. ( more egalitarian marriages, meanwhile, often involve less sex. )",

As such, he suggested the country should relinquish its claim to the gem. Not so, now says the very government he was representing in court. The ministry of culture on tuesday issued a statement saying india \" further reiterates its resolve to make all possible efforts to bring back the koh-i-noor diamond in an amicable manner. \" the diamond is said to have surfaced in the 1300s and gained a reputation as \" unlucky for men to wear \" as it passed from mughal princes to afghan rulers, writes the guardian. The wall street journal explains that an indian ngo in march filed a petition that seeks to have the court make the country go after the gem, and the government says kumar was communicating only the historical position the country has taken; prime minister pandit jawaharlal nehru did go on record decades ago saying india didn't have a solid claim to the gem. Kumar has been tasked with \" seek[ ing ] the views \" of india, and those have yet to be conveyed to the court, per the statement. Geeta pandey of the bbc says the culture ministry \" misread the popular mood, \" and the swift backlash led the prime minister's office to get involved. Read more on the stone here.",

        "summary": "It was an instantly historic speech: hillary clinton stood before democratic delegates in philadelphia thursday night and became the first woman to accept a major party's presidential nomination. Opinions on her convention address are split, largely along partisan lines, though all agree that it was quintessential hillary clinton. A roundup of reactions: this was the \" most consequential speech of her campaign, and of her career, \" and it \" seemed to contain an unspoken concession, \" writes michael barbaro at the new york times. \" besieged by lingering doubts about her honesty, mrs. Clinton made the case for a different kind of trust, \" he writes. \" not the textbook definition, but a more pragmatic faith in her judgment, experience, temperament, and priorities. \" it was a good, not great speech that didn't reveal a new side to the candidate, but it \" was exactly who clinton is: a worker, a nose-to-the-grindstone churner who never, ever stops, \" writes chris cillizza at the washington post. \" this was a speech that reflected the candidate — 50 feet off the ground rather than 50,000, policy details over soaring political rhetoric. \" \" the speech can be summed up simply: what you see is what you get, \" according to jeff greenfield at politico. \" you, the voters, she seemed to say, simply have to accept me as i am in all my pedestrian earnestness — especially if the choice is between me and donald trump, \" writes greenfield, who finds \" something almost admirable \" about her resistance to demands to \" lift the protective curtain. \" editors at the conservative national review were, unsurprisingly, not impressed. The speech was \" one part it takes a village and eleven parts old state of the union speeches from barack obama and her husband, \" they write, calling clinton out for admitting that democrats had failed to address the concerns of working people, but not explaining \" exactly how and why the obama administration failed to do what she believes it should have done. \" the speech wasn't exactly poetry, notes michelle goldberg at slate. It \" was workmanlike, more a series of bullet points than a story, \" she writes. Still, \" if you're a feminist, it's deeply moving to see a woman in a white suit — one of the iconic colors of the suffragettes — hug her daughter and then accept her party's nomination for president of the united states. \"",

            "Aaron p. Bernstein/getty images philadelphia — on june 15, politico ran a story about hillary clinton's bureaucratic speechwriting process. It describes how she gets input from a handful of staffers, various consultants, and her husband. She tweaks it herself, usually to make it more prosaic. \"clinton is known for taking a draft of a speech and changing it some indelible way to make it more literal and less readable, \" the piece said. Created in this fashion, the speeches are comprehensive but lack poetry, a sustained argument, or a narrative arc. Michelle goldberg michelle goldberg is a columnist for slate and the author, most recently, of the goddess pose.

        "summary": "\" our top-line growth... Was below our expectations primarily due to the slower than expected transition to the keurig 2.0 system, \" keurig green mountain inc. Ceo brian kelley explained in an earnings call yesterday, per the wall street journal. Seeking alpha sees it as the anti-iphone scenario: \" people are happy with the original and aren't interested for the most part in fixing what isn't broken. \" but at the washington post, fred barbash lays out a different problem: the \" my k-cup \" one. The coffee packaged into each k-cup costs customers dearly: on a per pound basis, they spend up to $ 60, or roughly five times what they'd pay for a bag of starbucks coffee. Enter the my k-cup, a refillable option that freed consumers from the expense and brand limitations of keurig's k-cups. The problem? the k-cups that worked in previous models ( both those made by keurig and its competitors ) lack a special ink introduced for the 2.0. Those cups no longer work, and neither do my k-cups; no new refillable option was introduced. The complaints came in short order. As a one-star amazon review for the k550 2.0 puts it, \" if you want a machine that brews a good cup of coffee then this will work for you. If you want a machine that puts all sorts of restrictions on what type of k-cups you can use this is also the machine for you. \" the post reports the company's initial line of defense was that the move was born out of safety, as the machine wouldn't know how to properly brew a coffee keurig didn't package. Other companies introduced hacks ( one competitor mailed out a free override device ), and yesterday, kelley \" capitulated, \" as barbash puts it, saying \" we heard loud and clear from consumers \"; the my k-cup will return.

            "Debate reaction: newt's night another day, another republican debate. But this one was more fun to watch than usual. Gingrich attacked romney. Santorum attacked gingrich. Gingrich attacked king. No, not martin luther. ( even republicans don't do that. ) i mean john, the cnn moderator. King's very first question was to gingrich, about the interview in which gingrich's ex-wife suggested he wanted an \"open marriage. \" gingrich said he was appalled that king began with that question, with so many weighty issues facing the nation. I happen to agree. The issue isn't totally irrelevant: if nothing else, gingrich has frequently made pronouncements about the sanctity of the family and the morality of public officials. That makes his personal morals fair game. But the very first question? and to stick with it, as king did,",
            "10.01 pm. A gingrich triumph. His only concern must be how well santorum did tonight. Paul performed well, but remains peripheral to the struggle for the orthodox \" conservative \" candidate. I think romney is in serious trouble now, and the bottom fell out tonight. He died with that glib response - \" maybe \" - to the question of whether he'd follow his father's example. It could well be that this could come down to romney-gingrich-paul. That trio is the end of republican fusionism. 9.57 pm. Paul's summary: freedom is awesome! gingrich: obama is a dangerous alinsky manchurian candidate who can only be stopped by my world-historical genius. Romney: obama is turning us into europe. Santorum: i ' m the real purist right-winger who can defeat democratic incumbents - and then lose by the biggest margin in history. 9.55 pm"

A new study finds a link between the man-made chemicals — which can mimic human hormones and are found in everything from nail polish to shampoo to hairspray — and the disease. Women ages 20 to 80 were studied, and those whose urine contained the highest concentration of the chemicals were almost twice as likely to have diabetes as those with the lowest concentrations. Even those with moderately high levels had an increased risk of about 70 %, the daily mail reports. Researchers hypothesize that phthalates might mess with the metabolism of fat tissue, thus leading to insulin resistance, often a precursor to diabetes.

        "summary": "Donald trump has described climate change as a hoax and a fraud — but he has inadvertently done more than most to bring about worldwide agreement on the issue. The new york times reports that fear of a trump presidency has helped united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon persuade more countries to ratify the paris climate pact, which is now expected to enter legal force by the end of this year. Trump has vowed to pull the us out of the pact — but president obama has already ratified the deal, and the withdrawal process takes four years. A round-up of coverage: the ap reports that 30 more countries are expected to join the paris deal this week, bringing it much closer to the target of 55 countries representing at least 55 % of emissions. When that target is hit, the deal will officially come into force. Some 375 scientists from the national academy of sciences and foreign affiliates — including stephen hawking and almost 30 other nobel prize winners — signed an open letter tuesday criticizing trump's pledge to pull the us out of the deal, reports reuters.

O ' rourke also wrote a book advocating for the legalization of marijuana and is described as \" free-spirited. \" democrats pretty much need o ' rourke to unseat cruz to have any hope of taking control of the senate in 2018. And that's a whole lot easier said than done.

Haag, who's sponsored by red bull, spent time with his head connected to all kinds of wires to reveal how his brain deals with virtual battle; the hope was that experts could use the data to improve his performance via various exercises, the new york times reports. Unsurprisingly, haag, who's from the chicago area, grew up playing video games — a lot of them. His father calls him something of a \" loner, \" but when it came to gaming, he would yell at fellow players to keep up. As a young teenager, he attended video game events, but it wasn't until recently that he started raking in cash; three years back, the times notes, he was working at mcdonald's. While video game competitions bring him some money, the key to his success is his online presence. Not only do fans watch him play games online; he also posts youtube video journals that can be very personal, and he's all over social media. \" what is it about me that people gravitate toward? i wish i knew, \" haag told the chicago tribune earlier this year. \" i don't consider myself to be over-the-top entertaining or someone that would be a joy to be around 24-7, but it's working for me. \" fans can even buy nadeshot merchandise.

They knocked pelke to the ground and cooper climbed on top of her, demanding money, before stabbing her 33 times. The youths made off with just $ 10 and an old car, the ap reports. Sentenced to death, cooper drew the support of millions, including pope john paul ii, before the indiana supreme court commuted her sentence. The state then raised the minimum age for a death sentence from 10 to 16, and later to 18. \" she was so sorry for the crime that she committed, and she worked hard to change her life, \" cooper's sister says, per the indianapolis star. \" while in prison, my sister grew from a teenager into a strong woman, and she was trying to build a future outside of those prison walls she had come to call home. \" a grandson of pelke, who visited and emailed cooper while she was in prison, says she hoped to dedicate her life to restorative justice and helping other abuse victims \" so they didn't end up like her. \" he last spoke to her in august. \" i thought she was doing well, \" he says. \" i have no idea what was going on in her life. \"",

The rare leopards, an endangered species living on the malay peninsula, have been hard to identify because each one appeared the same — until now. The researchers discovered that the big cats actually have complex designs of spotting when viewed through an infrared flash, according to a press release. \" most automatic cameras have an infrared flash, but it's only activated at night, \" says a researcher on the project. \" however, by blocking the camera's light sensor, we can fool the camera into thinking it's night even during the day, so it always flashes. \" the spots make it easier for humans to identify and track black leopards, which should save more leopard lives. \" understanding how leopards are faring in an increasingly human-dominated world is vital, \" says lead author laurie hedges. Few leopards actually live on the malay peninsula, perhaps due to poaching, while wire snares are killing them and wildlife markets are selling leopard body parts and skins. The rapid elimination of malaysian forests is also depriving leopards of suitable habitats. The black panther — or leopard in asia and africa — has long had a \" mythical aura \" dating back to rudyard kipling's the jungle book and stan lee's creation of the black panther superhero, mongabay.com reports. Another neat fact: the black leopard is \" perhaps the only known example of a wild mammal with virtually an entire population composed of black individuals, \" says hedges.

        "summary": "The rob ford saga has taken a big lurch forward with the release of police wiretap files detailing how the toronto mayor partied and took drugs with gang members — and how his life got pretty complicated as a result. Key allegations from the police files, as detailed by the national post, globe and mail, and toronto star: the infamous video of ford smoking crack was apparently set up by gang members who tried to blackmail him — and the mayor offered them \" $ 5,000 and a car \" for it. The offer was rejected and the owner said he planned to ask for $ 150,000 — which he could get from media outlets if the mayor didn't pay up. It's not clear whether he did: the original video's whereabouts are unknown, but police recovered a copy from a hard drive. ( ford denies trying to buy the video, calling the latest allegations \" an outright lie. \" ) drug dealers may have had a lot more than the video to blackmail ford with: one gang member boasts that there are photos of the mayor in \" a lot of f --- ed up situations, \" using drugs including heroin, crack, and marijuana. When news reports on the crack video's existence appeared, one of the mayor's top aides began a frantic search and managed to track down the house where a photo showed ford posing with drug dealers. Unknown intruders attacked the house's occupants days later, though the wiretap files do not link the aide to the attack. After ford apparently lost his cell phone at a crack house, a friend of the mayor's provided an unknown quantity of marijuana to secure its return. During negotiations, gang members made it clear that they didn't fear threats of police pressure because of their photos of the mayor taking drugs. In a bright spot for ford, he does not appear to be linked to a murder: one of the gang members he posed with was gunned down outside a nightclub earlier this year, but the police report dismisses any link to the crack video. The latest allegations have left many people wondering why no charges were ever laid against the mayor. \" i think any ordinary person who participated in this kind of activity, if it's founded, would find themselves in very serious trouble, \" a city councilor says.",

        "summary": "Based on a line in a local history book, jude plum suspected the two-story home he purchased out of pre-foreclosure in 2013 was old. He just didn't know it was one of the oldest surviving homes in pennsylvania. That fact, and more of the home's history, surfaced only when plum peeled back five layers of exterior to find a hand-hewn log frame untouched since 1704, making the home one of the two oldest standing houses in lower merion township, reports the philadelphia inquirer. Located on a busy road in bryn mawr, the log home next to plum's childhood home is believed to have been built by a welsh quaker who purchased hundreds of acres of land from william penn in 1682. It was then covered in clapboard sometime in the late 1700s. Because of damage from water, rot, and bugs, it would've made sense to \" put a match to it, \" says restorer roland cadle. Instead, plum opted to rebuild it with cadle's help, using vintage logs hewn by a 200-year-old broad ax. Cadle even purchased an 18th-century cabin just so the logs used would be as close as possible to the originals. He added wood from an 18th-century home in maine and period window panes, to boot. \" it's a restoration that's substantial, and should last a long, long time, \" says the president of the lower merion historical society. That's important, says 71-year-old plum, because he hopes the home will one day become a museum. He also hopes to have the home included in the national register of historic places, per the ap. ( at thomas jefferson's monticello, historians think they found the bedroom of slave sally hemings. )",

In fact, the russian government this year will spend about $ 200,000 for work of a \" biomedical nature \" to ensure the communist leader's body remains in \" lifelike condition, \" the bbc reports. Lenin's preserved body, now nearly 146 years old, has been on public display in a mausoleum in moscow for more than 90 years, according to the atlantic. The disclosure on the cost of maintaining the body came via the country's procurement agency website. The preservation process, per a 2015 scientific american report, includes being \" reembalmed \" every other year, which entails, \" submerging the body in separate solutions of glycerol solution baths, formaldehyde, potassium acetate, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid solution, and acetic sodium. \" lenin also wears a rubber suit under his dress clothes to keep a layer of embalming fluid covering him while on display. In addition to the regular embalming, lenin's eyelashes have been replaced, his nose has been re-sculpted, and artificial skin has been used to replace missing skin on his foot. Lenin reportedly wanted to be buried, cnbc reports, and plenty of russians feel the same way. A recent poll found that 62 % of 8,000 people thought the revolutionary should be given a proper burial. Some on social media decried the expense of maintaining a \" mummy, \" but vladimir putin seems content to keep lenin — who is not the only embalmed world leader on display — where he is. \" the way i see it, this issue [ of discussing the question of the body's reburial ] should be approached with utmost care so as to avoid taking any steps that might split society, \" he said after the poll.

            "For thousands of years humans have used embalming methods to preserve dead bodies. But nothing compares with russia's 90-year-old experiment to preserve the body of vladimir lenin, communist revolutionary and founder of the soviet union. Generations of russian scientists have spent almost a century fine-tuning preservation techniques that have maintained the look, feel and flexibility of lenin's body.

It's not unanimous, but a lot of people are calling sanders the winner.

The accident, which the sydney morning herald reports was witnessed by her parents, left kira grunberg a paraplegic. The austrian athletics federation said in a joint statement with the university clinic in innsbruck on friday that the 21-year-old suffered \" a fracture of the cervical vertebrae of the spine \" and underwent \" emergency surgery to stabilize her spine. \" the statement puts it plainly: \" at the moment, the continuation of her sporting career is not an option. \" in a post to her facebook page, grunberg's family notes the \" tragic accident \" didn't just end her career but also means a \" new life \" and \" long and difficult \" path for her. Npr reports she is now breathing on her own, and describes europe's sporting world as in shock but rallying to support grunberg financially.

Specifically, their pockets and sleeves were the most likely spots to be contaminated, reports webmd. Another potential hot spot: the bed railings of patients, according to a post about the research at eureka alert. The study followed 40 icu nurses caring for 167 patients at duke university hospital. Samples were collected from the nurses ' uniforms before and after their 12-hour shifts, as well as from the patients and objects in their rooms such as supply carts and beds. Researchers did not find any instances in which nurses passed along bacteria to patients, but they found that nurses picked them up from patients or the room in multiple instances. \" we know there are bad germs in hospitals, but we're just beginning to understand how they are spread, \" says lead author deverick anderson of duke university. Of the 22 transmissions they discovered, six were from patient to nurse, six were from the room to the nurse, and 10 were from the patient to the room, reports the cbc. The researchers looked for five strains particularly vexing to hospitals because of their resistance to antibiotics. They say one takeaway is the need for stricter protocols on hand washing and the use of gloves, even if a nurse doesn't actually touch a patient while in the room.

            "London ( reuters ) - u.s. Retailer michael kors ( kors.n ) agreed to buy luxury shoemaker jimmy choo choo.l for $ 1.2 billion, snapping up a british company whose towering stilettos have been made famous by celebrity customers from princess diana to kendall jenner. The move comes two months after rival handbag maker coach coh.n struck a deal to buy quirky fashion brand kate spade &amp; co kate.n, as so-called affordable luxury companies look at new markets and customer bases to boost flagging sales. Founded by bespoke shoemaker jimmy choo in the 1990s, the company makes three quarters of its revenue from selling shoes and has about 150 company-operated retail stores around the world. Its strong performance stands in contrast to kors, which has lost 65 percent of its market value since 2014 due to fierce competition and a drop in customers at department stores. Michael kors'shares fell 1.2 percent in morning trading on the new york stock exchange. Jimmy choo shares were up 17 percent at 228.00 pence at 1510 gmt. File photo: a"

        "summary": "An astronaut above the international space station has captured a stunning image of what nasa refers to as \" one of the few places on earth where an international boundary can be seen at night. \" the sept. 23 image shows the glowing, snaking border between india and pakistan, visible because of the indian floodlights that dot much of the way. The wall street journal notes two other such borders: the boundary lines between the koreas and between south africa and zimbabwe. In those cases, a dearth of electric lights on one side makes clear the difference. The india and pakistan boundary is visible because of lights that wind their way through nearly 1,200 miles ( the full border is about 2,000 miles long ). Their intended purpose is to discourage militants from crossing from pakistan into the part of kashmir controlled by india, per the journal. The economic times in march reported that due to the huge cost of lighting the border — owing to the electricity used and the diesel generators stationed there as back-up — the country intends to replace the floodlights with led bulbs in the coming years. A pilot program along the border in punjab will test out the led bulbs, which can have 50 times the lifespan of regular ones. A neat note from nasa regarding distances, time, and progress: it points out that in 327 bc alexander the great traveled through the indus river valley, which is identified in the image. He entered from the northwest and exited near karachi, at which point he headed back to what is now iraq. The journey took him \" many months \"; the iss covers the same distance in three minutes.

            "An astronaut aboard the international space station took this nighttime panorama while looking north across pakistan's indus river valley. The port city of karachi is the bright cluster of lights facing the arabian sea, which appears completely black. City lights and the dark color of dense agriculture closely track with the great curves of the indus valley. For scale, the distance from karachi to the foothills of the himalaya mountains is 1,160 kilometers ( 720 miles ). This photograph shows one of the few places on earth where an international boundary can be seen at night. The winding border between pakistan and india is lit by security lights that have a distinct orange tone. Another night image ( click here ) shows the border zone looking southeast from the himalaya. A daylight view shows the vegetated bends of the indus valley winding through the otherwise desert country. More than two millennia ago, alexander the great entered the indus plains in 327 bce from the northwest. He then spent many months leading his army and navy down the length of the indus valley shown in this view. From near karachi, he then began the desert march back to mesopotamia ( modern iraq ).
