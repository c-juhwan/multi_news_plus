On friday, hillary rodham ( now with a \" clinton \" tagged onto the end ) addressed graduating students there for the third time — she also spoke at commencement in 1992, when she was first lady, per fortune — and she had a lot to say on current political events, fake news, and the restorative power of a good bottle of wine. Some nuggets from her speech, per npr, tmz, and cnn: clinton didn't shy away from addressing the current us administration, calling the new trump budget proposal \" an attack of unimaginable cruelty on the most vulnerable among us \" that's \" shrouded in a trillion-dollar mathematical lie. \" in short, \" a con. \" she recalled what the climate was like during her 1969 commencement, pointing out striking similarities to america today. \" we were asking urgent questions about whether women, people of color, religious minorities, immigrants would ever be treated with dignity and respect, \" she said. \" and … we were furious about the past presidential election of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice.

Like the size of crowds, \" she said in one of what cnn calls her \" thinly veiled digs \" against president trump. These \" alternative facts \" can \" mark the beginning of the end of a free society, \" she noted, insisting her remark was not an exaggeration: \" it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done. They attempt to control reality. Not just our laws and our rights and our budgets, but our thoughts and beliefs. \" clinton had some \" good news \" to share as well: namely, that wellesley grads have the critical-thinking skills, education, and open minds to take on the challenges of the world. \" make defending truth and a free society a core value of your life every single day, \" she advised.

Ten years ago, the first 20 detainees were flown to the detention facility in chains. Several of those 20 remain at gitmo today, npr notes. Of the 171 detainees still held at guantanamo, just 36 will likely be given a military trial. Another 48 will, seemingly, be detained indefinitely; the us lacks a sufficient amount of evidence to try them, but insists they are too dangerous to release. Over the past decade, the facilities have been modernized and now appear unexpectedly permanent, considering president obama vowed to close the prison within one year of taking office — a deadline that expired two years ago. White house spokesperson jay carney this week insisted obama still has a \" firm \" commitment to closing the prison, but he also noted that the process \" faces obstacles that we're all aware of \" and said the administration \" will continue to work through it. \" in time, mark thompson writes, \" that's white house-speak for don't count on it. \"",

That's exactly $ 104 million more than donald trump. With less than three months until the election, the republican candidate has yet to spend a dollar on tv ads, though pro-trump groups have contributed $ 12.4 million. Even green party candidate jill stein has spent more, about $ 189,000, while libertarian gary johnson has spent $ 15,000, reports nbc news. If trump were already well ahead, keeping money in the bank might make sense. But an nbc weekly national poll finds he's nine points behind clinton, 50 % to 41 %, with a slightly higher unfavorability rating of 64 % compared to clinton's 59 %. Trump — of whom only 19 % of republican and republican-leaning poll respondents say has the personality and temperament to serve as president — is hardly short on cash. As the new york times reports, trump and the republicans raised $ 82 million last month alone. So what's he spending his money on? philip bump at the washington post says it's \" a question that defies a logical answer. \" he adds trump's lack of spending is particularly strange because \" the longer the trump campaign waits to reserve ad time, the less ad time exists to buy and the more ads cost \" since candidates in house and senate races are also in the mix. \" political scientists, you now have an amazing case study on your hands, \" as nbc puts it.",

        "summary": "It's bad enough to be detained for a crime you didn't commit; it's worse when that detention leads to nearly three weeks in the back of a van, deprived of a bathroom. The washington post reports a virginia man is suing for just that, saying he was arrested in september 2016 in winchester, va., with a cop telling him the car he was driving had been reported stolen in houston. He was then extradited to texas in an 18-day trip in a private prison transport van. Edward kovari's suit — filed against brevard extraditions, prisoner transportation services of america, and its parent company, prisoner transportation services — says he and the 15 or so others crammed in the van received small water rations and occasional fast food, that he was denied his hypertension meds, and that, due to no bathroom breaks, he spent much of the seven-state trip sitting in his own and others ' waste. An editor for a prisoner legal publication tells the ap conditions like these are common in the private prison transport arena, as the goal is to pick up as many prisoners around the nation as possible for \" cost efficiency. \" ( the marshall project has previously investigated this \" deadly world, \" including pts ' role. ) when kovari finally arrived in houston, he couldn't walk and his blood pressure had spiked to above 200 ( a systolic number above 130 is considered high ). \" the realization that this could happen to potentially anyone is frightening, \" one of the attorneys for kovari, now 39, tells the post. The charges against kovari were eventually dismissed. His suit alleges negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and a violation of his 14th amendment rights.",

The bbc reports a 12-day-old infant has died after a monkey yanked him from his mother's arms while she was breastfeeding him in her home on the outskirts of agra. The baby's father tells the times of india that the front door of his house was open and that the monkey \" barged inside... And grabbed the child by his neck. \" people nearby ran after the monkey, which \" only dropped [ the baby ] when people chased it with sticks and threw stones at it, \" a police supervisor says, per the bbc. The monkey ended up leaving the baby, named arush, on a neighbor's roof. The infant's head had been bitten; he died of his injuries at the hospital. Locals tell the times that just minutes before that attack, the same monkey went after a teen girl, who suffered minor injuries. Monkey infiltration in the city is apparently a major issue. \" [ they're ] everywhere in agra, \" a local environmental activist tells reuters, noting that the animals are being forced into the city as their natural habitats are increasingly disturbed by the growing city. \" they are in all the … railway stations in the city, in hospitals, hotels, and roads. \" a resident adds to ndtv: \" people do not dare to go to their terraces.

It notes a photo taken the day before, again by the right navcam, shows a similar light that the left again did not capture. Whatever it is, the buzz about the blip shows that people are examining the rover photos very closely. An imaging expert at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory shares his theory: a \" cosmic ray hit \" affected curiosity. ( meanwhile, this month mars is the closest it has been to us since 2007. )",

It's not the first voyeurism charge for foote, who also has burglary, theft, and domestic abuse arrests under his belt: in the late 2000s, he pleaded guilty to voyeurism at a tanning salon — for which he was made to complete a voyeurism treatment regimen, the salt lake tribune reports.

        "summary": "A blizzard of headlines over the past week have revolved around a spat between the netherlands and turkey, and seemingly at the center of them all is a far-right dutch politician named geert wilders. A primer on the diplomatic fight and the stakes involved: about wilders: he leads the party for freedom, and to say he espouses an anti-muslim philosophy is an understatement. He has compared the koran to mein kampf, referred to moroccan immigrants as \" scum, \" and called for all muslims to leave the netherlands. The new york times provides a quick political bio in this video. Dutch elections: the netherlands votes wednesday in national elections, and wilders is hoping that rising anti-immigrant sentiment will make him the next prime minister. He and current pm mark rutte debated monday night, and wilders referred to rutte as the \" prime minister for foreigners. \" the guardian has details. Where turkey comes in: turkey has a referendum of its own in april that would give president recep tayyip erdogan far more power, and government officials want to visit the netherlands to whip up support among turkish immigrants there because they can vote from abroad. The dutch government has refused, however, leading to nasty exchanges between the two nations. The netherlands ' hardline stance against the muslim country is seen as a way for mainstream parties to look tough on immigration and islam and to siphon votes from wilders, explains reuters. Go deeper: the cbc has a primer on the turkey-netherlands fight — \" a grudge match no one saw coming \" — pointing out that erdogan is using the fight with europe for his own political advantage. Huge test: the dutch vote will be followed by pivotal elections in france and germany, all of which will be a sign of how far \" populist nationalism \" has engulfed europe in the wake of donald trump's win and the brexit vote, observes an analysis at foreign policy. The piece doesn't think wilders will wind up as prime minister, but it says he has already won in a sense by shifting centrist parties to the right. More on turkey: for more specifics on the turkey vote, which critics say would amount to giving erdogan \" one-man rule, \" see the new york times. Wilders was convicted of hate speech last year.",

For that, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and paroled after six; a year later he confessed to \" grooming \" two little girls for sex, his parole was revoked, and he was committed for five years. In 2010, he was released, but only under the condition that he wear a gps monitoring anklet every hour of every day for the rest of his life, the chicago daily law bulletin reports. Belleau sued the wisconsin department of corrections over the statute requiring that penalty, courthouse news reports. He argued that the state's lifetime monitoring statute violates his fourth amendment right to be protected from unreasonable searches, and initially, a federal judge agreed. But the seventh circuit found that the statute is constitutional and that sex offenders can, within reason, be constantly monitored. \" pedophilia is a lifelong affliction for which there is no treatment, \" judge richard posner wrote for the three-judge panel. \" coupled with the particularly devastating consequences of their conduct, these offenders pose a unique... Challenge for conventional law enforcement techniques, \" and this statute \" is not punishment; it is prevention. \" posner noted that the need to protect children trumps the need to protect a sex offender's privacy, and added that since wisconsin sex offenders ' addresses, photos, and criminal records are already public, the additional monitoring isn't excessive.

Belleau was sentenced to 10 years in prison for this second offense, and his parole was revoked after he admitted having sexual fantasies about grooming little girls to molest them. He was civilly committed for five more years as a sexually violent person. As a condition of his release in 2010, belleau is required to wear a gps monitoring anklet 24 hours a day for the rest of his life. He sued the wisconsin department of corrections, claiming the lifetime monitoring violates his fourth amendment protection from unreasonable search. A",
            "Wisconsin lawmakers didn't violate the u.s. Constitution when they mandated that anyone deemed to be a sexually violent person wear a gps monitoring device following his or her release from civil commitment, a federal appeals court has held. The 7th u.s. Circuit court of appeals last week upheld a state statute requiring such persons to wear a monitoring device for the rest of their lives. All the members of a three-judge panel rejected michael j. Belleau's argument that the statute violates the constitution's prohibition on ex post facto laws. The panel acknowledged the statute was enacted after belleau committed the crimes that landed him first in prison and then in a treatment center under a civil commitment order. And the panel acknowledged that article i, section 10, clause 1 prohibits punishing people for conduct made criminal only after they engaged in it or increasing the sentence for their crime above the maximum that was in place when they committed it. However, the panel's majority wrote, citing cases that included smith v.",

Per a german terrorism tracker, cuspert — deemed a \" specially designated global terrorist \" in february by the state department — was reportedly traveling in a pickup truck on a road between raqqa and al-tabqa when his vehicle was slammed by missiles from two coalition aircraft, cnn reports. Despite his menacing-sounding state department designation, cuspert — who was just days shy of his 40th birthday, the network notes — wasn't considered by the dod to be a \" high-value target, \" per the afp. But he was one of the most high-profile ones. After joining isis in 2012, he went on to appear in several of the group's videos, including one in which he held the severed head of an alleged isis enemy, as well as another cited by the washington post in which he splashes in a stream and yells, \" jihad is a lot of fun! \" during his stint with the group, he threatened not only obama, but also us and german citizens. Germany had been keeping its eye on cuspert, with intelligence officials compiling a 25-page report that went into how he had likely been radicalized by germany's ultraconservative salafists, turning into what the report labels \" a well-known german-speaking demagogue of the armed jihad, \" nbc news reports.",

He first acknowledged an obvious point at the salt lake city rally: \" i recognize fully that i am a balding, youngish, middle-age straight, white, male, republican politician... With all of the expectations and privileges that come with those labels, \" he said, per usa today. \" i am probably not who you expected to hear from today. \" but he then went on to apologize for not treating gay people kindly while growing up in a rural small town. A key passage: \" there were some kids in my class that were different. Sometimes i wasn't kind to them. I didn't know it at the time, but i know now that they were gay. I will forever regret not treating them with the kindness, dignity, and respect — the love — that they deserved. For that, i sincerely and humbly apologize. Over the intervening years, my heart has changed. It has changed because of you. \" other highlights from the speech, plus reaction: \" i ' m here because, yesterday morning, 49 americans were brutally murdered. And it made me sad. And it made me angry. And it made me confused. I ' m here because those 49 people were gay. I ' m here because it shouldn't matter. But i ' m here because it does. \" \" i am not here to tell you that i know exactly what you are going through. I am not here to tell you that i feel your pain. I don't pretend to know the depths of what you are feeling right now. But i do know what it feels like to be scared. And i do know what it feels like to be sad. And i do know what it feels like to be rejected. And, more importantly, i know what it feels like to be loved. \" vox post: \" it's an incredible speech full of empathy and humility, and it's worth watching in full.

        "summary": "Rodney berget, 56, was put to death by lethal injection monday night for the 2011 murder of a south dakota prison guard, marking the state's fourth execution since it reinstated the death penalty in 1979. The last execution took place in 2012. The execution had been slated for 1: 30pm but was delayed as the supreme court considered whether to stay berget's execution. Attorney general marty jackley announced the decision around 6: 30pm. More: the crime: it was april 12, 2011, ronald \" rj \" johnson's 63rd birthday. He wasn't supposed to be working at the south dakota state penitentiary, but he was filling in for a sick co-worker. Berget and eric robert had for months plotted their escape, which involved beating a guard, who ended up being johnson, with a pipe and covering his face with plastic wrap. Robert put on johnson's uniform and pushed a cart of boxes out of the prison; berget was in one of them. But things went awry at the second gate, and the men never made it outside the prison. Robert was executed on oct. 15, 2012, but berget's case dragged due to his mental status, reports the ap. The intercept dives deep into whether berget had an intellectual disability that should have barred him from execution, and opens with a powerful anecdote: of juliet yackel, a woman who had been hired as part of berget's state habeas appeal, visiting him and hearing berget boast of a precious childhood memory — participating in the special olympics. That alarmed her, and her investigation into his childhood ( he was found to have an iq of 70 at age 9 ) convinced her that \" something had gone horribly wrong with berget's defense, \" as the intercept puts it, as his intellectual capacity hadn't featured into his trial. But in february, a judge upheld the death sentence.",

Berget seemed proud as he brought up the memory. As a young kid in the 1970s, he had problems fitting in, and this had been a rare chance to compete — \"to be able to be just like everybody else around him, \" yackel recalled. In a different context, this might not have raised an eyebrow. But berget was on death row. Under the u.s. Supreme court ruling in atkins v. Virginia, people with intellectual disabilities are ineligible for execution — it is one of the first things defense attorneys are supposed to look for when representing a client in a capital case. Yet there was no sign berget's trial attorney had investigated this background at all. Yackel, a veteran mitigation specialist based in chicago, had originally been hired as part of berget's state habeas appeal, to seek possible claims of ineffective assistance of counsel — failures by his original defense attorney that might show berget's trial had violated his constitutional rights.

The psychologist testified that during an interview, geyser kept moving, laughed wildly, said she can talk with mutant ninja turtles, and expressed a belief in vulcan mind control. More importantly, geyser seemed concerned with angering a fictional internet character called slender man — for whom she and 12-year-old friend anissa weier allegedly stabbed a classmate in june. \" they certainly take fantasy to an extreme level and i think they may be delusional, \" the psychologist said about her beliefs.

If doctors can't make her trial-ready in 12 months, she may end up in a treatment center for a longer term. \" competency to proceed \" and \" not guilty by reason of insanity \" are quite different, the journal sentinel notes, but the state said in court that geyser may use the incompetency ruling to later mount an insanity defense.

An annan spokesman tells the ap that he's having \" similar discussions \" with rebels. The team is supposed to ensure that both sides are adhering to annan's peace plan — which so far they're decidedly not doing. Indeed, un secretary general ban ki-moon today criticized the syrian regime for failing to live up to its end of the bargain. In a letter to the security council, ban called for the number of monitors to be upped to 300, the bbc reports. Nicolas sarkozy went even further today, calling for humanitarian corridors to be set up throughout syria to help the rebels. The wives of the british and german ambassadors, meanwhile, tried a different diplomatic tactic, issuing a youtube video urging asma assad to \" stop being a bystander \" and convince her husband to stop the bloodshed, cnn reports. Though based on her emails, there's little chance of that.",

Per the los angeles times, the mega-producer turned tinsel town pariah has been spending a great deal of his time — and money — in the phoenix area. Specifically, the la times report says the once-celebrated movie man has sought treatment at a rehab center where costs can be as high as the tens of thousands of dollars. In addition to the army of attorneys he's taken on to defend him from allegations of sexual assault, weinstein is reportedly in legal tussles with his current and former wives as well as his former company. He's also being represented by a crisis pr firm. All the while, weinstein is reportedly shelling out to live in high-end arizona resorts while receiving hypnotherapy treatments, and dining at the finest area eateries. As weinstein continues to spend in arizona, tmz reports that the company he helped build is now being brought to its knees after some 80 women came forward with accusations of sexual misconduct against the producer. The weinstein company has filed for bankruptcy as it faces lawsuits filed by some of weinstein's accusers who say the company knew about his alleged misdeeds while failing to put an end to them. Tmz reports that multiple investors had considered bailing out the company before their deals all fell through. Weinstein faces criminal investigations in new york, california, and london. Through his attorneys, weinstein has consistently denied all claims of non-consensual sex.",

British tabloid newspaper the sun reports that the new footage features the singer using the n-word in \" one less lonely girl \" ( altering the hook to be \" one less lonely n ----- \" ), joking about killing black people and entertaining the idea of joining the ku klux klan. Though the undated video is not included in the online report, the sun claims that that it shows bieber seated and wearing a dog tag and a dark blue shirt, and he sings unaccompanied, repeatedly weaving the racial slur into the lyrics of his 2009 hit. The footage emerges just as bieber issued an apology on sunday for a five-year-old clip -- originally recorded when the singer was 15 but recently posted by the sun -- that shows the pop star telling a joke with a racist punchline. The earlier video has since been posted on tmz. In that clip, bieber is heard asking, \" why are black people afraid of chain saws? \" he then answers his own questiony with a reference to the n-word. \" five years ago i made a reckless and immature mistake, and i ' m grateful to those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man, \" he apologized. \" once again … i ' m sorry. \" photos: stars behaving badly — from justin bieber to reese witherspoon, hollywood's recent mugshots that first video could've been kept away from the public, tmz reports.

The lawyer allegedly attempted to persuade bieber's team to pay as much as $ 1 million to stop him from selling the footage to the media. The videos follow bieber's attempted robbery investigation in may, detainment at the los angeles international airport in april, dui arrest in march and alleged egging incident in january.

        "summary": "What transpired in russia that led jordan weissmann to pen a piece for slate titled \" russia is so screwed \"? the country's central bank made a surprise decision in a 1am meeting to jack its interest rate from 10.5 % to 17 % in a last-gasp attempt to stanch the fall of the ruble, which has been hammered this year by sinking oil prices and the impact of the west's sanctions. It didn't work, writes matt o ' brien at the washington post's wonkblog. The ruble plummeted 11 % against the dollar today, its steepest intraday fall in 16 years. Pundits are weighing in on what this means for russia and putin, and using \" doom \" and its synonyms. As o ' brien sees it, \" it's a classic kind of emerging markets crisis. It's only a small simplification... To say that russia doesn't so much have an economy as it has an oil exporting business that subsidizes everything else. \" our own oil supply is up, while demand from elsewhere is down. And even that wild interest rate isn't enough to make russians warm to the ruble. \" in other words, there's a well-justified panic. So now russia is left with the double whammy of a collapsing currency and exorbitant interest rates. Checkmate. \" writing for reuters, timothy heritage suggests that putin needs to \" act fast \" but has some time — though not a lot of options. Heritage talks to one pollster who believes that putin's \" store of support \" will last him 18 months to two years, and that the \" first signs of discontent \" will emerge in spring. \" putin is aware that his predecessor, boris yeltsin, resigned early after a financial crisis and that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev's grip on power slipped as the economy crumbled. \" now isn't the time to gloat about \" the abrupt collapse of his regime's economic clout, \" writes geoffrey smith for fortune. Smith doesn't see putin backing down on ukraine, or backing down in general. In fact, \" doubling-down with another foreign policy adventure to distract from domestic problems hardly seems fanciful any more. \" ( smith suggests kazakhstan as a potential target. ) \" the only other way out is for putin to be replaced in a palace coup... But anyone with memories of 1991 and 1993 will remember how badly they can go. Barring a rapid turnaround in the oil price, there are only bad and worse outcomes from here on. \"",

Indeed, osama's compound is almost adjacent to a military academy that the country's military chief visited last month. President obama made a point of crediting pakistan for helping with the attack. But pakistan doesn't seem to want any part of it — in a statement from its foreign ministry today, it pointedly avoided any mention of pakistani involvement, calling the attack a \"direct action by us forces, \" and saying that president zardari had only learned about it when obama called to tell him about it, the washington post observes.",

Because the wells are located on tribal land, oklahoma regulators have no jurisdiction over oil- and gas-producing facilities in the region. Oklahoma corporation commissioner matt skinner told the associated press that the u.s. Environmental protection agency notified the state tuesday that 17 wells were ordered closed. \" we've never had to do anything that directly involved osage county, but on saturday ( the epa ) were quick to respond, \" skinner said. \" they confirmed on sunday they were going to put that directive in place, and today they gave us the numbers. \" the 17 wells are located in a 211-square mile area within osage county, near where a magnitude 5.6 temblor struck saturday.

One man suffered a minor head injury in the quake when part of a fireplace fell on him, and emergency management officials said tuesday they have received reports of damage to at least 11 homes. Oklahoma state university also reported several buildings at the stillwater campus sustained damage, but all of those were determined by structural engineers to be safe for occupancy. A regional spokesman for the epa, joe hubbard, did not confirm any details about the wells in osage county that were shut down, including the volume of wastewater that was being disposed into them.

            "The u.s. Geological survey is examining whether the 5.6-magnitude earthquake that shook oklahoma on saturday and tied for the strongest temblor ever recorded in the state was triggered by the underground disposal of wastewater from oil and gas production. The quake, which damaged some buildings but didn't cause serious injuries, spurred oklahoma regulators within hours to demand that operators of 37 disposal wells in a 500-square-mile area shut down. It took place around 7: 02 a.m. Saturday near pawnee, okla., a town of...",
            "Oklahoma city ( ap ) — federal regulators have shut down 17 wastewater disposal wells in the osage nation of northeastern oklahoma following a weekend earthquake that matched the state's strongest on record, state officials confirmed tuesday. Because the wells are located on tribal land, oklahoma regulators have no jurisdiction over oil- and gas-producing facilities in the region. Oklahoma corporation commissioner matt skinner told the associated press that the u.s. Environmental protection agency notified the state tuesday that 17 wells were ordered closed. \" we've never had to do anything that directly involved osage county, but on saturday ( the epa ) were quick to respond, \" skinner said. \" they confirmed on sunday they were going to put that directive in place, and today they gave us the numbers. \" the 17 wells are located in a 211-square mile area within osage county, near where a magnitude 5.6 temblor struck saturday. The epicenter was near pawnee. One man suffered a minor head injury in the quake when part of a fireplace fell on him, and emergency management officials said tuesday they have received reports of damage to at least 11 homes. Oklahoma state university also reported several buildings at the stillwater campus sustained damage, but all of those were determined by structural engineers to be safe for occupancy. A regional spokesman for the epa, joe hubbard, did not confirm any details about the wells in osage county that were shut down, including the volume of wastewater that was being disposed into them.

        "summary": "A hunter in british columbia was being attacked by a grizzly bear when his hunting partner came to his rescue — only to accidentally shoot him. Despite the really bad day, it seems his injuries aren't life-threatening, the national post reports. The 56-year-old, whose name is given as wilf lloyd by ctv, was hunting sunday morning when the bear attacked, prompting his hunting partner to shoot; the partner did eventually kill the animal, though not without hitting lloyd first. An atv and helicopter took lloyd — a taxidermist, ctv notes — to the hospital. An expert warns that bear spray is a better option than a gun when dealing with an attacking bear. \" even if you're able to score a lethal hit on the animal as it's coming at you, it can still complete the attack because it's running on adrenaline, \" the expert says. \"on the other hand, bear spray, all it requires is a wall of spray between you and the bear. As soon as it hits the wall of spray, its attention is about getting away from that spray. \"",

Meanwhile, another australian oceanographer tells the new york times that even if the debris proves to be from flight 370, using that info to try to backtrack along ocean currents to find the bulk of the wreckage would, as the paper puts it, \" be akin to using modeling of big-city crowd flows to try to predict the travels of a random person encountered on the street.

His mother, 47-year-old michelle lodzinski, was arrested in florida this week — on what would have been timothy's 29th birthday — and charged with killing her son, reports the ap. She initially claimed he had escaped her watchful eye at a new jersey carnival in may 1991. His remains were found in 1992 near where lodzinski used to work in edison, nj, according to the star-ledger. Lodzinski, who has been living with her two teenage sons in port st. Lucie, is being held in florida and is expected to be extradited to new jersey. Authorities had always considered lodzinski a suspect but didn't have the \" direct smoking gun \" to go after her, says a prosecutor. Specific evidence that warranted reopening the case wasn't cited in the indictment report. Lodzinski had raised red flags with law enforcement by changing her story several times after timothy's disappearance, and neighbors told the ap that her emotionless response to his death didn't seem to fit that of a grieving mom. She's also had a string of other arrests since timothy's murder, including one for falsely claiming she was abducted and one for lifting computer equipment from an employer. Her brother-in-law — who tells the stuart news via the star-ledger that lodzinski is a \" hard-working single mother \" — says \" they're just dragging up old dirt, that's all. \"",

Aides in both parties tell the washington post that the most logical step would be for harry reid to amend the house bill to let taxes rise for the wealthy and to extend unemployment benefits — without addressing the debt ceiling or making major spending cuts. President obama will be back in washington by noon, after a hawaiian holiday vacation, according to the hill. His aides have been in contact with harry reid's office in recent days, but their conversations haven't included republicans, the ap reports. Democrats increasingly believe republicans will wait to act until after boehner is re-elected speaker on jan. 3. \" i think there's some chance that we get a deal done in the early weeks of january, \" one representative said yesterday, \" which technically means you're going over the cliff. \"",

The st. Louis post-dispatch reports the incident occurred early monday in the loy-lange box company; the boiler flew 500 feet and landed on the faultless healthcare linen building. When rescue teams arrived at the latter building, they found two dead, with a third person alive but trapped under the cast-iron boiler; that victim has been hospitalized in critical condition.

One unnamed faultless worker tells the post-dispatch that a secretary and two workers who had recently joined the company were those involved, though police haven't released such details. \" that boom is in my mind, \" he says. \" it's a thing you don't forget. \"",

        "summary": "Hillary clinton faced an 11-hour grilling by the house benghazi committee on thursday, and the consensus is that she managed to emerge largely unscathed from the marathon hearing, which included discussion of her emails and a tense exchange about sidney blumenthal. But, as panel chief trey gowdy admitted afterward, it didn't reveal anything new about the 2012 attack. A few takes on the hearing: the long-anticipated hearing turned out to be pretty boring, which made it a triumph for clinton, according to chris cillizza at the washington post. Unlike the benghazi hearing in 2013 where she clashed with rep. Ron johnson, \" there was no negative sound bite from her. No acknowledgement of error, \" or signs of \" weakness or confusion \" about the events in libya, he writes. \" the hearing was, in a word, boring. And that's exactly what clinton wanted. \" the failure of gop panel members \" armed with thousands of emails and testimony from scores of witnesses \" to trip clinton up will further strengthen her campaign after her strong debate performance and joe biden's decision not to run, write byron tau and peter nicholas at the wall street journal. Clinton \" held her ground in calm fashion \" even as the questions grew \" increasingly acrimonious, \" with suggestions that she didn't care about the victims of the attack, they write. The hearing may look like a clinton victory, but it could turn out to be a \" delayed-fuse defeat, \" according to glenn thrush and gabriel debenedetti at politico. They note that the fbi is still investigating clinton's email use at the state department, and it could be a major problem for clinton if anything the fbi uncovers contradicts anything she said on the subject at the benghazi hearing. Clinton was trying to appear more serious than the panel questioning her, write evan halper and david lauter at the los angeles times, and \" members of the committee often appeared to help, engaging in one high-decibel shouting match and numerous partisan jabs. \" the five democrats on the 12-member panel may now step down to avoid giving the committee undue \" respectability, \" they note. The long hearing did nothing to advance the public's understanding of the events in benghazi, but it showed that gowdy \" and his colleagues have squandered more than $ 4.6 million and countless hours \" for partisan reasons, the new york times editorial board writes, saying that the gop panel members ' \" flailing performance \" should mark the end of a \" wasteful and counterproductive exercise that accomplished nothing. \"",

Now researchers at the university of california san diego are reporting in the journal acs sensors that they've developed a temporary electronic tattoo that can induce just enough sweat to get a highly accurate read — which would be sent to a smartphone with an easy-to-interpret app — in minutes. \" such a device hasn't been available until now, \" engineering professor patrick mercier says. Quartz reports that transdermal bracelets have already been developed to do the same, with sf-based bactrack winning a $ 200,000 first prize for developing the prototype, according to ieee spectrum. But the wearable device is clunkier and results can take hours, whereas the ucsd device would be not only less bulky but also less pricey. Their system includes a temporary, flexible tattoo that clings to skin and a flexible circuit board smaller than a stick of gum attached to the tattoo via magnets. Readouts on nine test subjects were accurate even after the devices were bent and shaken, so the team is now working on full-day continuous monitoring. For, you know, those big benders.

She was also \" one of the most contaminated animals on the planet, \" dr. Andrew brownlow tells the bbc. Brownlow says lulu's body contained \" shocking levels of pcbs. \" researchers found 957 milligrams of pcbs per kilogram in the killer whale; it's believed the toxic chemical starts causing health problems for marine mammals at just 9 mg/kg, according to the guardian. The average concentration of pcbs in killer whales in the northeast atlantic is 150 mg/kg. Pcbs can hurt the immune system and hamper reproduction, and the latter effect has scientists worried for the future of killer whales in the uk. Despite being at least 20 years old, lulu doesn't appear to have ever been \" reproductively active. \" if the rest of lulu's eight-whale pod has similar levels of pcb contamination, it's \" increasingly likely \" it will go extinct, brownlow tells usa today. Scientists haven't seen any killer whale calves born in the waters around the uk in the past 25 years. Pcbs were outlawed in the 1970s but don't break down in nature and may still be leaking into the environment from waste storage sites. They work their way up through the food chain stored in the fat of animals; and killer whales are near the top of that chain.",

            "The actress, who turns 101 on july 1, is the only living person portrayed in the fx series. Fx has a legal feud on its hands following its series about bette davis and joan crawford — and it doesn't come from heirs of either of the titular characters. Olivia de havilland is suing the network and ryan murphy productions over her portrayal by catherine zeta-jones in feud: bette and joan. In a complaint filed friday in l.a. County superior court, de havilland claims she has built a reputation for integrity and dignity by refraining from gossip and other unkind, ill-mannered behavior — but the series opens with zeta-jones doing an interview as de havilland and creates the impression that she was a hypocrite who sold gossip to promote herself. \" [ a ] ll statements made by zeta-jones as olivia de havilland in this fake interview are completely false, some inherently so; others",

De havilland, who lives in france, takes issue with the show's re-enactment of a purported interview at the 1963 academy awards in which she is shown gossiping about the relationship between davis and crawford. \"there was never a rivalry like theirs. For nearly a half a century, they hated each other, and we loved them for it, \" zeta-jones'de havilland says in the show. But",

They were on either side of cardinal timothy dolan, archbishop of new york, at the 71st alfred e. Smith memorial foundation dinner, an annual fundraiser for catholic charities where candidates usually exchange good-natured insults in election years. There was a sharper edge at the waldorf astoria gala this year, and trump was booed and jeered for some of his harsher remarks about clinton, the new york times reports. Some of the best lines, per abc news, the ap, and the new york daily news: trump: \" the media is even more biased this year than ever before. You want the proof? michelle obama gives a speech, and everyone loves it. It's fantastic. They think she is absolutely fantastic. My wife, melania, gives the exact same speech and people get on her case. \" \" just before taking the dais, hillary accidentally bumped into me and she very civilly said, ' pardon me. ' and i very politely replied, ' let me talk to you about that after i get into office. ' \" \" last night, i called hillary ' a nasty woman. ' but this stuff is all relative. After listening to hillary rattle on and on and on, i don't think so badly of rosie o'donnell anymore. \" clinton: \" it's amazing that i ' m up here after donald. I didn't think he'd be ok with a peaceful transition of power. \" \" maybe you saw donald dismantle his teleprompter the other day. I get that. They're hard to keep up with, and i ' m sure it's even harder when you're translating from the original russian. \" \" this dinner brings together a collection of sensible, committed, mainstream republicans, or, as we now call them: hillary supporters. \" \" people look at the statue of liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants, a beacon of hope for people around the world.

The attack from all sides will likely cramp romney's style to appear to be the gentlemanly candidate with his eye on the big race against the president, and not his current rivals. Something that might clip his wings a bit is a super pac tv ad out this week supporting newt gingrich: it portrays multi-millionaire romney as a predatory capitalist who destroyed jobs and communities when he ran the private equity firm bain capital. The ad is based on a movie financed by an anti-romney gop money-man that involves tearful interviews with people who lost jobs at companies bought and sold by bain, according to the times.

At least that's how long it took nadia, the russian blue, to trek from her home on a snowy december day to sunny naples this week where animal officials helped find her owners. Her mode of transportation? \" i have no clue, \" owner cheri stocker said by phone wednesday. Stocker and her husband adopted the cat about nine months ago and renamed",
            "The journey home is almost over for nadia the cat. She made it from sheboygan to naples, florida when she went missing on christmas eve. How she did it, no one knows. But her family traveled to rockford, illinois to anxiously wait their reunion. Cheri stocker, nadia's owner, has gotten used to waiting and watching and worrying. Nadia went missing christmas eve when she escaped out the back door of her sheboygan home. The family spent weeks searching the neighborhood. Cheri had feared the worst, but still left out a bowl of food every day hoping nadia would come back. Finally, a call she never expected: nadia had been found, in florida. \" it was unbelievable, \" cheri says. But the next problem was - how to get her back? dozens of people offered to drive nadia home. But an allegiant air"

The ap reports that 13 men have been arrested in west bengal state after the attack on monday night. The woman remains hospitalized. The incident began when the woman's boyfriend, who lives in a nearby village, showed up at her house to propose. Other villagers then detained him and formed what police call a \" kangaroo court. \" both he and the woman were tied up and ordered to pay a hefty fine. He did so and was released, but the woman couldn't afford it, reports the bbc. Her family quotes a village elder as saying to men watching the proceedings, \" her family could not pay, so go enjoy the girl and have fun. \" that village elder, reportedly a distant relative of the woman, was among those arrested. A reporter for the times of india visits chowatta, where the attack took place, and finds that residents appear to be unanimous in two seemingly conflicting sentiments: first, the girl deserved to be punished because she \" brought disrespect to our community, \" as one woman puts it; second, they insist that the accused men are innocent.",

And while the senate is \" a group that's generally less proactive than a mummy, \" she reserves special affection for the house. \" to be fair, it takes a lot of effort to vote to repeal obamacare 33 times. \" thankfully, she writes, we ' ll be losing \" nut jobs \" like allen west and joe walsh, but the congressional shenanigans won't end if collins gets her wish for a south carolina senate seat showdown: \" people, while you are praying for a safe, sane, and peaceful new year, i want you to make a small exception and pray that jenny and mark sanford run against each other. \" howard kurtz, the daily beast: kurtz says the 112th's legacy has nothing to do with any significant legislation and everything to do with the new normal it ushers in: \" the era of a national legislature boldly tackling major problems is over. The era of the grand bargain is over. Even the era of hold-your-nose-and-cooperate-for-the-good-of-the-country is over. \" jonathan allen, politico: allen notes that the 112th exits stage left having instituted the least number of laws of any since record-keeping began in 1947. \" a congress that opened with the arrival of the much-heralded tea party descended into a two-year food fight, and it will leave the mess to its successor. The 113th congress will be sworn in on thursday. The members of the 112th congress just hope they don't get sworn at. \" ezra klein, bloomberg: klein sees the 112th as having come full circle, starting with april 2011's near government shutdown and ending with the fiscal cliff, another self-created \" mess it couldn't clean up. \" the cliff deal \" simply sets up another fight in the weeks ahead. Continued fear and uncertainty over the impending battle is the legacy of the 112th to the nation's economy. Thanks, guys. \"",

The most complicated part is cleaning the anchors; in other words, threading your rope through the rings or chains at the top so you can lower down, grab your draws, and not leave any gear behind. This procedure is potentially dangerous because you may have to untie from your harness and retie after threading — and mistakes happen. We learned the following technique from rick vance, technical information manager at petzl, and we like it because it's simple, clean, quick, and your partner never takes you off belay.

        "summary": "Air pollution has been blamed in an eighth of all deaths worldwide in 2012, and it just got deadlier: on the heels of studies that have produced similar findings in canada, south korea, and taiwan, spikes in air pollution are being linked to spikes in suicides, reports livescience. Researchers at the university of utah report in the american journal of epidemiology that acute air pollution, marked by \" short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter, \" led to a 20 % increase in the odds of \" completing \" suicide in the two to three days following those spikes. Suicide \" is a preventable outcome, and air pollution could be a modifiable risk factor, \" says the study leader. One possible link is physical inflammation, notes livescience, which can be caused by air pollution and which is increasingly being identified as a risk factor for suicide. Picking apart the records of the more than 1,500 people who died by suicide in salt lake city between 2000 and 2010, researchers found that two groups in particular — men and people between the ages of 36 and 64 — had the highest suicide risk after this short-term exposure to higher air pollution. They caution, however, that it's just one study joining a still small body of research, and that the link is not necessarily causal, with many questions lingering. For instance, the link was strongest in the spring and fall, not winter, leading them to believe that other risk factors are at play. And while they controlled for sunlight exposure, the researchers did not directly control for precipitation, which might play a role in pollution levels.

            "Abstract research into environmental factors associated with suicide has historically focused on meteorological variables.

Here, we examined the associations between short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide and completed suicide in salt lake county, utah ( n = 1,546 ) from 2000 to 2010. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to estimate adjusted odds ratios for the relationship between suicide and exposure to air pollutants on the day of the suicide and during the days preceding the suicide. We observed maximum heightened odds of suicide associated with interquartile-range increases in nitrogen dioxide during cumulative lag 3 ( average of the 3 days preceding suicide; odds ratio ( or ) = 1.20, 95 % confidence interval ( ci ): 1.04, 1.39 ) and fine particulate matter ( diameter ≤2.5 μm ) on lag day 2 (",

Their study, titled \"acute air pollution exposure and risk of suicide completion, \" examines how those factors play out among different genders and age groups. The findings build on other research by bakian released in april 2014, when she found that fine particulates and nitrogen dioxide in air pollution are linked with an increased risk for suicide.

We observed maximum heightened odds of suicide associated with interquartile-range increases in nitrogen dioxide during cumulative lag 3 ( average of the 3 days preceding suicide; odds ratio ( or ) = 1.20, 95 % confidence interval ( ci ): 1.04, 1.39 ) and fine particulate matter ( diameter ≤2.5 μm ) on lag day 2 (",
            "( feb.12, 2015 ) — a new study from the university of utah is adding to the small, but growing body of research that links air pollution exposure to suicide. In research published today in the american journal of epidemiology, investigator amanda bakian, ph.d., an assistant professor of psychiatry at the university of utah, and her colleagues outline chemical and meteorological variables that are risk factors for suicide. Their study, titled \"acute air pollution exposure and risk of suicide completion, \" examines how those factors play out among different genders and age groups. The findings build on other research by bakian released in april 2014, when she found that fine particulates and nitrogen dioxide in air pollution are linked with an increased risk for suicide. In the latest study, bakian and researchers found an increased risk of suicide associated with short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter among salt lake"

Some students at kent state were angered when they saw that three leading roles portraying puerto rican characters, along with many supporting roles, were given to white and other non-latino students, kentwired reports. \" it's more than just getting a role, \" viviana cardenas says. She was in the running for a puerto rican character, anita, but an african-american student ultimately got the role. \" when there is this story that is about people of cultures like me, about people of color like me, and that gets taken away from me … that was the most heartbreaking. \" however, another theater student tells the kansas city star that the university was \" bowing to racists. \" the star notes that casting issues have dogged west side story for decades, ever since natalie wood, a white actress, was cast as the puerto rican female lead, maria, in the 1961 film.",

The fliers were barred from exiting because, the crew reportedly said, there were too many other people being held at the airport amid what etihad airways called \" unprecedented fog. \" \" the delay was then compounded by the requirement to replace the aircraft's ultra-long haul operating crew, who had exceeded their flight time limitations, \" the airline notes. \" everybody was fighting with each other, and the flight attendants were fighting with us, and we were fighting with the flight attendants, \" says another passenger. The group was eventually given food, but only after some complained, the ap notes. Tweeted one passenger: \" i feel like i ' m in a seinfeld episode, \" reuters reports.

In early 2015, eric martin spent $ 18,000 in a bid to win a contest being offered by the new startup jet.com: sign up the highest number of people for a preview version of the site, get 100,000 stock options. Cnn money reported that the then-28-year-old funneled money to sites like swagbucks, getting people to sign up in exchange for rewards. More than 8,000 signups later, he was the winner. And how. With walmart's monday announcement of its $ 3.3 billion acquisition of jet.com, the man from york, pa., will likely reap a seven-figure windfall, reports bloomberg. \" the way i think to describe it is 'occasional hysterical laughing, \" the 30-year-old says of his reaction. Reports at the time of his win put the potential value of the shares at up to $ 20 million, but cnbc reports martin doesn't know the value of his shares, and bloomberg explains how that number could be higher or lower due to changes in valuation or the distribution of preferential shares. At the time of his win, he told cnn money, \" i bought some snow crab legs to celebrate, but that's about it. \" he was equally low-key for fox43: \" i'd consider myself middle class so i have everything i need. \" soon, he ' ll have that plus a pile of cash.

Wftx reports lauren dondero was on a mother's day fishing trip to fort myers beach when she caught a hammerhead shark. After an hour and a half of reeling, dondero says she brought the shark onto the beach and posed for photos with it for about 10 minutes before returning it to the ocean. \" it was the most exciting feeling in the world seeing a hammerhead, \" she says. The shark was found dead on the beach hours later, according to wptv. The news of the shark's death combined with photos of dondero posing with the shark on social media attracted the attention of conservation group sharks after dark. \" you don't pull a hammerhead all the way up onto the beach, you don't let it dry out, and you definitely don't sit on top of it and take photos, \" an activist with the group tells wptv. A 2014 study showed hammerheads are the most likely sharks to die from being caught and released, the orlando sentinel reports. Lactic acid builds up in their bodies while they struggle to get free and combines with stress to kill them. A local environmental technician says that could be what happened with this hammerhead, according to fort myers beach talk. Despite a law against bringing hammerheads onto the beach, dondero, who reported herself after hearing of the shark's death, won't be punished. \" i made a mistake, and i apologize, \" she tells wftx. \" i was crying for that shark. \" ( similar sad stories involved peacocks and a baby dolphin. )",

Why did michelle \"bombshell \" mcgee come out with her story? a friend says she asked james for money to open a strip club, \"and she totally lost it when jesse rejected her. \" mcgee's ex-husband says the tattoo model was obsessed with james even during their marriage, telling the insider he once found a picture of james ' face taped over his in a photo.

Police say magdiel sanchez's father was behind the wheel of a car that hit an object and didn't stop. When officers arrived at his home to investigate, they found sanchez — who had not been in the car with his father — on the porch. Police say sanchez was holding a metal pipe ( officers originally called it a stick ). According to nbc news, a neighbor says sanchez, who was deaf and used notes to communicate, often carried the pipe to ward off stray dogs during nighttime walks. Officers told sanchez to drop the pipe and get on the ground. He couldn't hear them. As sanchez walked toward officers, neighbors screamed that he \" can't hear you. \" capt. Bo mathews says it's possible officers didn't hear the neighbors. \" when you have a weapon out, you can get what they call tunnel vision, or you can lock into just the person who has the weapon, the threat against you, \" mathews says. Lt. Matthew lindsey fired a taser at sanchez while sgt. Christopher barnes fired his gun, koco reports. The officers were about 15 feet away from sanchez at the time. Mathews says barnes fired \" more than one \" shot at sanchez. According to the washington post, it's unclear why barnes used his gun instead of a taser. Neither officer was wearing a body camera. Barnes has been placed on leave. Sanchez, who died at the scene, had no criminal history.",
