Authorities issued two indictments against the cartel and gang, with some 400 atf and local officers arresting nearly two dozen people and seizing 600 pounds of meth ( value: $ 19 million ) and a number of firearms in raids across los angeles on monday, reports cbs los angeles. \" this is the first time the street gangs and cartels have come together on this scale, \" says birotte. The deal, creatively titled \" the project, \" would have given members of the cartel protection and \" free rein \" to sell meth in southern california ( much of which is controlled by the mexican mafia and affiliated street gangs ) so long as it provided money and meth to members of the prison gang, according to one indictment, the times reports. Many of those named in the indictments are already behind bars, and if convicted, will be dispersed to other prisons across the country in an effort to weaken the gang's operation, says birotte.",

An unnamed associate says it's really not about hydration at all, likening the water to a \" security blanket. \" what does rubio say? schreckinger points to a november new yorker article in which rubio said his throat continually \" feels dry, \" citing adult-onset allergies that he has suffered from ( due to extensive travel, suggested his doctor ) since 2011. A rubio rep gave only this comment for the article: \" politico has lost its mind. \" that doesn't stop schreckinger from asserting that the timeline shows his penchant for water can't really be due to circa 2011 allergies; from digging into the particulars of rubio's water needs ( he reportedly requests water in a stemless glass only when giving speeches ); and from noting that on the rare event it's absent, rubio seems to have bumbling moments.

In his twenties, as an obscure republican state legislator, rubio exhibited such innate political skill that dan gelber, the democratic leader of the florida house, warned his colleagues, \"when marco rubio speaks, young women swoon, old women faint, and toilets flush themselves. \" now that he was a presidential candidate, rubio was trying to speak to as many different audiences as possible. The elks lodge was decorated modestly, with just a few campaign banners hoisted amid the taxidermy — a demonstration of thrift intended to contrast with the front-runner for the republican presidential nomination, the billionaire donald trump, and to counter claims that rubio occasionally spends more money than he should.

Under the new rules, all commercial imports of african elephant ivory are banned, including antiques. Most domestic sales will be banned as well; there are exemptions for antiques, as well as ivory that meets endangered species act protections, but it ' ll be up to sellers to prove beyond doubt that their ivory qualifies. That last change is especially important, activists tell the washington post, because it's been nearly impossible for law enforcement to figure out which ivory was purchased before the 1989 ban. \" we're eliminating the loopholes that help smugglers launder newly poached blood ivory via us markets, \" the chief of law enforcement for the us fish and wildlife service tells national geographic.

Scott ard claims his 2015 firing from yahoo's media department was motivated by his gender, and meyer's wish to see more women in leadership positions within the company. The lawsuit also accuses two other female yahoo executives of gender discrimination: former marketing chief kathy savitt and yahoo news editor megan liberman. Ard's lawsuit alleges that 87 % of the hires and promotions handed out by savitt were to female employees, that liberman altered performance reviews to favor women, and that meyer put the system in place which enabled all of this. A yahoo spokeswoman would not comment on the pending lawsuit but generally defended the company's performance-review system as fair. Previously, a company-wide diversity report revealed that the percentage of women in leadership roles at yahoo ticked up a percentage point to 24 % between 2014 and 2015, cnet notes.

The other 73 who broke out using a 336-foot-long tunnel code-named harry were recaptured, and 50 were executed at the command of adolf hitler. The telegraph uses the occasion to speak with a man it says is one of two remaining survivors from that night: dick churchill. Churchill, 94, was not one of the three to make it to freedom — those men died in the ' 90s, reports the bbc. He worked as a digger on the tunnel, and had learned a few romanian phrases in an effort to lend credence to the romanian papers he had been given. He and his partner, bob nelson, were among the last 30 or so men to exit through the tunnel, with plans to head some 50 miles to the czechoslovakia border. They traveled through snowy conditions for two nights before seeking shelter in a barn. But germans had ordered all barns within a hundred miles of the camp to be searched. \" they removed all the hay gradually and when they got into the far corner, the pitch forks being dangerously close, they found us, \" says churchill. He was imprisoned with the other captured escapees, 50 of whom were gradually removed from the cells to be killed. Why was churchill spared? \" i think it was my name. I ' m pretty certain. I ' m not related to churchill, to my knowledge. But they thought i might be. \" ( click to read about the man who was the key forger in the escape — but chose to stay behind. )",

Less funny: craig cobb and a minion got charged this weekend with walking around leith and menacing residents with guns, reports the los angeles times. The charges may just scotch the 62-year-old cobb's grand plans: five of the seven counts of terrorizing carry sentences of two years each because they involve guns, reports the bismarck tribune. \"it's a great feeling, \" says a city council member. \"this could be a notch in the beginning of the end. \" cobb had texted the local newspaper before the weekend patrols saying that they were necessary \" because of the many violences and harassments \" against him and his handful of supporters. Among other things, their car tires got slashed. Coming full circle in the it's-hard-not-to-laugh department, cobb intends to represent himself in court — though he complained that his memory is shot because he can't take his gingko supplements behind bars.

And cobb's standing plot to take over the tiny town of leith and create a white-supremacist enclave, is now threatened by charges that he used a gun to terrorize several of the town's residents along with another supremacist over the weekend.

        "summary": "As allegations pile up against harvey weinstein, the new york times reports on a case that nearly exposed the producer's alleged serial sexual harassment two years ago. A police sting caught weinstein admitting on tape that he grabbed an italian model's breasts. But after a stable of well-connected weinstein lawyers and handlers mobilized to discredit ambra battilana, 22, the case was dropped within two weeks in april 2015. Prosecutors, including current new york city da cyrus vance, decided battilana wasn't a credible witness because she disavowed statements she made in italy related to a sex harassment claim, as well as a sex party thrown by former pm silvio berlusconi. Weinstein's lawyers said he touched battilana's breasts to determine if they were real for a lingerie ad. Prosecutors decided the allegations weren't strong enough. The police disagree. \" we brought them a very good case, \" a senior nypd official tells the times. After the case was dropped, the times says \" weinstein silenced ms. Battilana with a substantial payment, \" though she says she then watched her fashion career fizzle. Meanwhile, the nypd said on sunday they were probing new allegations against weinstein. And in london, cops said a third accuser stepped forward accusing weinstein, 65, of sexually assaulting her three times between 2010 and 2015, the telegraph reports. One of the accusers who has gone public, actress lysette anthony, tells the mail on sunday she chewed raw garlic to fend off weinstein. She says she saw no way to speak out after he raped her. \" even after all these years, i can still wake up screaming, \" she adds. ( weinstein lost his oscars membership. )",

            "The fresh allegations follow several made by actresses in the us against weinstein - four of rape and more than 30 of sexual harassment - and come as the organisation behind the oscars expelled weinstein. Bafta had already suspended the producer and on tuesday weinstein's wife, british designer georgina chapman, said she was leaving him. Actress anthony, 54, told the sunday times she met the producer when she starred in 1982 sci-fi film krull and the alleged assault occurred a few years later. She said it was a \" pathetic, revolting \" attack that had left her \" disgusted and embarrassed \". On wednesday, anthony tweeted that she had just reported a historical crime, adding \" feel sick... So sad \". Fellow british star kate winslet also spoke of her recollections of weinstein, saying it was \" absolutely deliberate \" that she did not thank the director when she won",
            "Many were young, powerless and afraid to speak out in case their careers were ruined. For nearly three decades their accusations remained bottled up, some suppressed by pay-offs. More than 30 women have now come forward with allegations of sexual harassment against hollywood producer harvey weinstein, the man once described as ' god ' of the film industry. The accusations, including from some of the world's most famous actresses, range from inappropriate massages to rape. Here is a list of those who have come forward so far. Kate beckinsale in an instagram post the underworld star said weinstein made a move on her when she was just 17. ' when i arrived reception told me to go to his room. He opened the door in his bathrobe. I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any",
            "They took a seat on the couch, and ms. Battilana began showing mr. Weinstein her modeling photos on a tablet computer as they discussed the possibility of her working as a lingerie model, according to the account she later gave police. When the topic turned to whether her breasts looked real, mr. Weinstein lunged forward and grabbed them. She protested and pushed his hands away, but mr.

Bafta had already suspended the producer and on tuesday weinstein's wife, british designer georgina chapman, said she was leaving him. Actress anthony, 54, told the sunday times she met the producer when she starred in 1982 sci-fi film krull and the alleged assault occurred a few years later. She said it was a \" pathetic, revolting \" attack that had left her \" disgusted and embarrassed \".

The accusations, including from some of the world's most famous actresses, range from inappropriate massages to rape. Here is a list of those who have come forward so far. Kate beckinsale in an instagram post the underworld star said weinstein made a move on her when she was just 17. ' when i arrived reception told me to go to his room.

Chinese president xi jinping is currently on a two-day trip to pakistan to finalize a big investment in its links with its neighbor: $ 45 billion to be spent on energy and infrastructure projects, the ap reports. The bbc reports that the central effort will be a china-pakistan economic corridor, made up of roads, rails, and pipelines linking china and pakistan across 1,865 miles. With the corridor running between kashgar in china's western xinjiang province and the arabian sea port of gwadar, it will provide the chinese with a direct route to the indian ocean. The effort is central to bolstering china's economic sway in the region, the bbc notes, and the guardian gives context to the new route: china must currently reach the middle east's oil-producing countries via a longer path that winds through the south china sea and strait of malacca, which is traffic-heavy and frequented by pirates. \" the real opportunity of this china-pakistan economic corridor is that it changes the scope of the relationship from geopolitics to geo-economics, \" the pakistani official in charge of the effort tells afp. The countries will also partner to yield 16,400 megawatts of electricity through gas, coal, and solar projects, afp notes; the resulting energy, the minister says, matches the current capacity of all of pakistan. One possible hurdle, reuters notes, is the corridor's path through baluchistan province, home to a separatist insurgency.",

But last november, the uk builder found something much better — 22,000 fourth-century roman coins, the biggest such cache ever found in britain. The coins, which date from ad260 to ad348 and are known as the seaton down hoard because of where they were found, went on temporary display at the british museum last week, the telegraph reports. But before that, they had to be excavated — and while archaeologists worked on that, egerton, 51, couldn't bring himself to leave the site. \" i slept in my car alongside it for three nights to guard it, \" he says. \" every night the archaeologists packed up and left, and i couldn't go home and sleep thinking there was something of such significance sitting there in a hole in the ground. \" experts are impressed with the find, which includes coins struck in honor of the foundation of constantinople in ad332 that feature emperor constantine the great's image; one archaeologist says they were probably someone's savings. \" there were no high street banks, so a good, deep hole in the ground was as secure a place as any to hide your savings in times of trouble, or if you were going away on a long journey, \" he explains. They were found in a field near a previously excavated roman villa site, and egerton first spotted two thumbnail-sized coins on the ground. His metal detector then uncovered iron underground — something many metal detectors won't do, because it's typically worthless — and he soon found himself bringing up a \" shovel... Full of coins — they just spilled out over the field, \" he says. Authorities declared the coins to be official treasure, meaning they're eligible to be acquired by a museum; the royal albert memorial museum is trying to raise the money to buy them. Egerton has a license to operate on the land where they were found, so he and the landowner will split the proceeds — and the copper coins could be worth tens of thousands of dollars, though in their day, an expert tells the guardian, they were probably only worth the equivalent of four gold coins. Egerton hopes to keep one of the coins as a memento. \" i have found lots of interesting items but never anything of this magnitude, \" he says. \" it really doesn't get any better than this. \" ( this summer, an artist hid $ 16,000 worth of gold bars on a beach. )",

The goal is to make the herd of rare black and southern white rhinos unattractive to poachers, who last week shot and killed a white rhino at a french zoo before making off with its horns. \" the attack [ in france ] put us on alert, the danger is really intense, \" says a rep for the dvur kralove zoo. She explains 18 of the 21 rhinos — the number excludes three calves — will be put under and then have their horns chainsawed off and filed. It's a process that has been done before, she says, but never for this reason. Its rhinos ' horns would be worth a pretty penny: they can go for $ 25,000 a pound on the black market, per the afp. How that translates: the bbc reports that 21 rhino horns recently seized at bangkok's international airport are worth an estimated $ 5 million. Per the international rhino foundation, half a million rhinos \" roamed the wild \" in the early 1900s; today that number has dwindled to 29,000. In china and vietnam, the creature's horn is prized as having medicinal value and is used as an aphrodisiac, though there is no scientific evidence of either. The foundation points out that consuming horn is basically akin to eating your own hair or fingernails; all three are made of keratin.",

        "summary": "Hummingbirds beat their wings approximately 50 times per second, but that's nothing compared to how fast they can drink. A study out of the university of connecticut debunks nearly 200 years of scientific thinking on how hummingbirds accomplish that task, with results showing the tiny birds can sip up to 10 drops of nectar every 15 milliseconds, the christian science monitor reports. Scientists have long believed hummingbirds drank by wicking, a process that \" allows liquid to flow through small spaces without benefit of gravity, \" explains uconn today. Researchers were skeptical of this relatively slow method because it would limit hummingbirds ' energy intake, and they set off on a five-year study to find out how the birds really do their drinking. \" it turns out that hummingbird tongues do not wick — they pump, \" sums up the monitor. Researchers took video of 18 hummingbird species drinking from specially made artificial flowers in the wilds of the us, ecuador, brazil, and colombia. They discovered that hummingbirds drink by using their tongues as \" elastic micropumps. \" this video shows the process, and livescience explains it like so: \" after zipping toward a flower, the hummingbird flattens its outstretched tongue, and'the compressed tongue remains flattened until it contacts the nectar,'the researchers wrote in the study. ' after contact with the nectar surface, the tongue reshapes, filling entirely with nectar. ' \" the last move involves a deft bend of the tongue to pull in the nectar, and it all takes place in less than a tenth of a second, according to uconn today — an impressive feat for something thinner than a fishing line. ( meanwhile, a tongue-rolling myth in humans has been debunked. )",

The bbc reports michael rohana was attending such a party four days before christmas at the franklin institute in philadelphia when he allegedly entered a room that was closed to guests but, per the guardian, had an unlocked door. Inside were 10 of china's famed 8,000 terracotta warrior statues, on loan from china. Xinhua reports on the fbi's allegations: that the 24-year-old took a selfie with the statues, touched the left hand of one and seemed to break something off it, then left. On jan. 8, museum staffers discovered the statue he was said to have touched — valued at $ 4.5 million — was missing a thumb. An investigation led to rohana and his home in bear, del.; he allegedly confessed to having broken off the thumb and placed it in his desk drawer. An fbi affidavit states that a friend claims rohana also snapchatted a photo of the finger the day after the party, reports the courier post. China is incensed, with the head of the organization that loaned the statues to the us asking \" that the us severely punish the perpetrator. We have lodged a serious protest with them. \" two of the organization's members will travel to the us to see the damage first-hand and make the repair with the now-recovered thumb.

Human t-cell leukemia virus type 1, or htlv-1, is considered a sexually transmitted infection since it can be spread through unprotected sex; it can also spread via blood contact and breastfeeding. It weakens the immune system and can lead to a number of serious health conditions; in up to 10 % of cases, a \" rapidly fatal \" form of leukemia develops, the guardian reports. Yet the chair of the global virus network's htlv-1 task force, whose lab first detected the virus in 1979, says almost nothing has been done to attempt to screen for, treat, or vaccinate against the disease. \" the virus is neglected, and the diseases that it causes are neglected, \" says another expert. Htlv-1, whose dna can be found in andean mummies from 1,500 years ago, is present around the world, but is highly endemic in several areas including the central australia cluster. Indigenous communities are being hit the hardest in australia, with a rate of prevalence that is \" probably the highest-ever reported... In any population, \" says an expert, who notes that people in the area — including young people — are dying from the lung condition, bronchiectasis, it can cause. \" a 45 % infection rate in communities is shocking to me, \" he tells the guardian.

        "summary": "President trump on tuesday signed an executive order to unwind many of the environmental rules put in place by president obama. The big change is that he ordered a review of the clean power plan, which was designed to curb emissions at coal-fired power plants. The president celebrated \" the start of a new era \" in energy production, while environmentalists called it both \" dangerous \" and \" embarrassing. \" a look at coverage: trump signed the \" energy independence \" executive order at the epa while surrounded by coal miners. \" today i ' m putting an end to the war on coal, \" he declared. See coverage of the event at the guardian. The clean power plan hadn't actually taken effect yet because it had been held up in the courts, explains the new york times in a primer. Despite the move to ease up on coal regulations, the utility industry is expected to continue its shift toward natural gas, wind, and solar, reports the wall street journal. It points out that us utilities generated more electricity last year from natural gas than coal, and that trend is expected to continue. The ap takes a look at the effect on the coal industry and doesn't see a quick turnaround in the cards. In terms of jobs, it notes that more efficient ways of extracting coal have reduced the need for miners. Amplifying the point is a quote from robert murray, chief executive of coal giant murray energy. \"these actions are vital to the american coal industry, to our survival, and to getting some of our coal families back to work, \" he said of trump's action. But he added: \" i really don't know how far the coal industry can be brought back. \" see the new york times. Trump's move does not pull the us out of the 2015 paris climate accord, but it seriously undermines the promises made at the forum by president obama. An npr interview explains. Not far enough? conservative critics are unhappy trump did not order the epa to re-evaluate a 2009 \" endangerment finding \" that greenhouse gas threatens human welfare, notes politico. A writer at breitbart makes the case that epa chief scott pruitt should resign over this. A takeaway from a washington post analysis: \" while trump can unwind obama's climate legacy to some extent, the economic and political forces that have spurred those underlying shifts are largely beyond his control. \" now comes the hard part, warns cnbc: tuesday's move provides a framework, but the white house must still come up with a detailed replacement for the clean power",

            "Evan vucci / associated press a police boat and helicopter patrol near the scene of a shooting at navy yard in washington on sept. 16, 2013 updated at 4: 06 p.m. On september 17, 2013 a soon-to-be-released government audit ( now public, see update below ) says the navy, in an attempt to reduce costs, let down its guard to risks posed by outside contractors at the washington navy yard and other facilities, a federal official with access to the report tells time. The navy \"did not effectively mitigate access-control risks associated with contractor-installation access \" at navy yard and other navy installations, the report by the department of defense inspector general's office says. Parts of the audit were read to time by a federal official with access to the document. The risks resulted from an attempt by navy officials \"to reduce access-control costs, \" the report finds. The audit comes as questions are emerging about how the alleged perpetrator, or perpetrators, of the attack at navy yard in washington on monday gained access to the facility. At least 13 people are dead in the attack, including the alleged attacker, aaron alexis. Alexis had been working for a company that computer giant hewlett-packard hired to help maintain the navy marine corps intranet, basically the sea service's in-house internet. According to a statement from the company",
            "A gunman killed a dozen people as the workday began at the washington navy yard on monday, creating an improbable moment of horror at a military facility with armed guards at every gate and leaving investigators seeking clues about what spurred the attack. The fbi identified the shooter as aaron alexis, 34, of fort worth, who in 2011 received a general discharge from the navy reserve, a designation that usually signals a problem in his record. Alexis was arrested but not charged in a gun incident in seattle in 2004 but still had a security clearance with a military contractor that allowed him access to the navy yard, officials said. The suspect died when the mayhem ended in a gun battle with police. Late monday night, authorities began releasing the names of those killed in the rampage, but some family members were still awaiting word about loved ones. The dead ranged in age from 46 to 73 years old. The shootings constituted the worst loss of life in a single incident in the region since the sept. 11, 2001, attack on the pentagon killed 184 people. \"this is yet another heartbreak for our city, \" said del. Eleanor holmes norton ( d-d.c. ). Alexis left texas about a year ago, and authorities made a public appeal monday for help in tracing his movements since then. They said they"

In fact, the percentage of donors who died of overdoses has nearly tripled since 2006, according to data gathered by the united network for organ sharing. If you look back as far as 2000, it's jumped from just 1.1 % to 9.3 % of all deceased donors. The increase has been \" huge, \" one expert tells us news &amp; world report. \" it's a silver lining to what is absolutely a tragedy. \" the network estimates that more than 121,000 people are waiting for a life-saving transplant today, while the guardian reports that 22 people die every day on the wait list. And it's no wonder; in 2015, organs were only recovered from 9,080 deceased donors, with 848 of those donors having died of an overdose. Some have expressed concerns about the quality of tissue donated from a drug addict, and infections such as hiv and hepatitis c have been reported. But the risk of transmitting a virus remains low, and with the other option being death, most patients are willing to take the risk. And behind the numbers are, of course, countless personal stories. As the daily union reports in wisconsin, one mother of a 17-year-old daughter who overdosed on heroin in 2012 grieved in a message she wrote waiting for the organ donation team to arrive: \" how did we get here, peanut? i never thought i would be giving pieces of you away.

The death cap is said to look very similar to the popular paddy straw mushroom, with a white cap and yellowish stem that can be bulbous at its base. While toxicology results have yet to confirm what the boy ate, his family is urging the public to be aware of the risks; ingesting just one cap can be fatal, and the cbc reports that death caps are responsible for nine out of every 10 mushroom poisoning deaths in the world. \" it's worthwhile learning how to recognize this particular species because of the consequences if you accidentally eat it, \" says one forest ecologist.

Among b.c.'s thousands of mushrooms, this is one that should be on your radar. \" it's worthwhile learning how to recognize this particular species because of the consequences if you accidentally eat it, \" said andy mackinnon, a biologist and forest ecologist in metchosin who teaches field courses on mushroom identification. Toxins in the death cap attack the liver, kidney and other organs and ingesting one cap is enough to kill.

One of peach's major innovations is a list of \" magic words \" you can type in to easily draw a picture, post a gif, and more. Cnet has the complete list.

There are no hashtags, and users can't tag one another in posts. \" skeptical? usa today asks, \" you sure this isn't the next ello? \" referring to the last flash-in-the-pan social media app that attracted a lot of attention before dropping off the face of the earth.

Noaa researchers say a major cause of the drought has been a warm, dry, high-pressure ridge over the eastern pacific and western us that has blocked precipitation — and climate models say greenhouse gases should have the opposite effect, causing slightly more precipitation in the region instead of blocking it. \" the report is not dismissive of global warming at all, \" an noaa meteorologist and study co-author says. \" at the same time, drought is not a consequence of the warming planet to date. \" but scientists not involved with the study accuse the noaa researchers of failing to take into account how warmer temperatures aggravated the drought, including causing more moisture to evaporate from the ground. The report \" completely misses any discussion of evapotranspiration and the increased drying associated with global warming, \" a climate scientist at the national center for atmospheric research tells nbc. The scientists are even unable to agree on how bad the drought is, the ap reports: a study co-author says it doesn't rank among the five worst in the state's history, but a separate study released this week says it's the area's worst in 1,200 years.",

Washington's body was found badly decomposed in an irrigation ditch last week after her daughter prompted investigators to search for her \" sleeping \" mother, who she said was \" in the lake \" after \" mr. Robbie \" hurt her. Robert marks, 39, the assistant principal at brookstown middle magnet school, was originally charged with kidnapping and abandoning washington's daughter in a parking lot the night of the murder, but he's now charged with murder and infanticide. He has yet to talk. In a recent text message to marks, washington asked if he was trying to get out of his responsibility for \" our unborn child, \" according to a police affidavit. One of washington's friends tells wafb that no one missed any clues: \" it's just that he was just who he was and we had no way of seeing that or knowing that. Some people are masterminds at deception. \" the school, meanwhile, is reeling, with superintendent warren drake releasing a statement that washington \" will be remembered for the impact she had on the many lives she touched through her work in our district. \" the advocate notes that washington, whom friends call generous with her students even if she was struggling, lived in a one-bedroom apartment, needed a new car, had no working computer, and was pursuing a master's degree in education.",

Police say 58-year-old nagako tomioka, the high priestess of the tomioka hachimangu shrine, was killed by her brother, shigenaga tomioka, on the temple grounds after she got out of her car, the ap reports. His female accomplice attacked the driver, inflicting non-life-threatening injuries and chasing him hundreds of feet down a road, leaving a trail of blood. Shigenaga tomioka is believed to have then killed his accomplice before taking his own life. The bbc reports that, according to local media, 56-year-old shigenaga tomioka became high priest of the 400-year-old shrine, which has close ties to sumo wrestling, in the 1990s after his father retired. But after he was fired in 2001, his father took over as main priest again and made his daughter his deputy. She became high priestess after her father retired for a second time in 2010. Shigenaga tomioka was arrested in 2006 after sending his sister a threatening letter, telling her he would \" send her to hell, \" reuters reports.

Morrissey overwhelmed by fans rushing stage in san diego tonight, while singing, \" everyday is like sunday \" encore... Audience boos... [ update nov 11: since i posted this, saw talk of a punch being thrown but that's not what i saw.... Fans were jumping on to stage earlier on in the concert and morrissey kindly shook their hands and they were calmly taken back to where they had come from - and morrissey kept on singing - super professional. It was pretty harmless and good natured. I think the guy in this video who forced the abrupt ending just kind of slipped and tumbled into morrissey which made it look like he was leaping at him. Just my opinion from being there. ]",
            "Overzealous morrissey fans ambushed the stage at his concert in san diego on saturday, forcing security to rush the singer off the stage but not before the 59-year-old was jostled by the mob as he was finishing an encore performance. The english singer, in town for a sold-out solo concert at jacobs music center's copley symphony hall downtown, was just wrapping up his second encore song — reportedly \"everyday is like sunday \" — when fans rushed the stage, cutting his performance short. During the incident, initially reported by the tabloid news website tmz on sunday morning and described as an \"attack, \" one of the concertgoers appeared to have \"struck him in the face \" while on stage at the 2,200-seat venue. A 34-second video posted on tmz showed the singer still performing when concertgoers stormed the stage. A few seconds later, security personnel appeared, and chaos ensued. The video showed the singer being rushed off the stage. He",

Just an overzealous fan. Katsis says the guy was attempting what morrissey fans have been doing for years -- trying to touch or hug the man himself. He adds that this fan was a bit aggressive, and that's why security subdued him. But, katsis says no one was hurt or arrested. Hell... The fan even thanked morrissey, saying he's got nothing but love for \" el jefe. \" morrissey was swept off stage saturday night after a bunch of concertgoers rushed the stage. It went down at the san diego symphony hall, as the singer was about to do an encore at the end of his performance"

Here's what you need to know: congress has already left town for the weekend. \" i think the sequester is crazy, \" rep.

Pressed yesterday to name which services or contracts the cuts might hit, jay carney could muster only that the sequester would reduce funding for school children in ohio. Most of the pain will only gradually roll over americans, cnn money explains. Starting today, agencies will limit their contracts and grant awards, but furloughs won't take effect until march 26 or later — the irs, for instance, has said it won't furlough anyone until after the april 15 tax filing deadline, the washington post reports. But all of this is just a prelude to the next fight: the battle over the continuing resolution funding the government, which needs to be passed by march 27 to avoid a shutdown — which could make the sequester look like a cakewalk.

        "summary": "The legalization of pot combined with more potent strains of marijuana appears to be increasing the number of cases of a rare ailment that causes regular bouts of vomiting. As kaiser health news explains via npr, the obscure and hard-to-diagnose ailment is called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. Generally, it afflicts longtime, regular pot smokers, and a post at men's health notes that the worst aspect of it typically shows up without warning — sufferers start vomiting violently and persistently up to five times an hour, and this cycle can last up to two days. While in the throes of the cycle, those with chs often report that hot baths or showers ease their discomfort, perhaps a sign that the marijuana is messing up their body's cannabinoid receptors, which play a role in regulating the nervous system. The ailment has been on the books only since 2004, and thus is often misdiagnosed. What's worse, those misdiagnosed may actually turn to marijuana to ease their nausea, only to bring on the cycle again. ( a woman cited in the npr story ended up in the hospital roughly three times a year for nearly 20 years before chs was finally diagnosed. ) one theory is that increased levels of thc in modern strains of pot, in addition to legalization, are causing the ailment to surface more regularly, reports nbc san diego. Stats remain difficult to gather and assess, but anecdotal evidence seems to back that up. \" in my work, in the emergency room, i see at least one patient a day with the cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, \" says a physician at san diego's scripps mercy hospital. For now, there's only one cure: stop smoking pot.",

        "summary": "The naacp has issued a travel advisory for a us state, a first in the civil rights group's history. The missouri naacp first circulated the advisory against travel to the state in june, and the national organization has now voted to adopt it, mcclatchy reports. The advisory comes after racist incidents including racial slurs against black students at the university of missouri and painted on a barbershop's windows, as well as the death of tory sanders, a tennessee man who ended up in missouri when he made a wrong turn on a road trip, ran out of gas, and ultimately ended up dying in a jail cell in the state. There have also been other incidents of harm to and discrimination against minorities in the state, plus racial disparities in traffic enforcements. But the final straw was legislation passed in missouri recently that makes it harder to sue for housing or employment discrimination. That law takes effect aug. 28, and naacp leaders are urging people to file discrimination complaints before then. Especially disturbing to rod chapel, president of the missouri naacp, is that the university of missouri system supported an earlier version of the legislation — which, in an interview with cbs news, he calls \" the jim crow bill. \" it requires alleged victims of discrimination to prove discrimination was a \" motivating, \" rather than just a \" contributing \" factor. Plus, \" you have violations of civil rights that are happening to people. They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed, \" chapel tells mcclatchy. \" we are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before. \" other issues include 100 hate crimes reported in 2015 and an attorney general's report that shows black drivers in the state are 75 % more likely to be pulled over than white drivers.",

Six days ago, she developed pneumonia; shanbaug passed away today, just shy of her 68th birthday, the times of india reports. While alive, shanbaug became the face of a euthanasia debate in india, whose supreme court denied a request to let her die in 2011, the bbc reports. \" my broken, battered baby bird finally flew away, \" says pinki virani, a journalist and author who filed the case rejected by the supreme court and wrote extensively about shanbaug's plight. \" and she gave india a passive euthanasia law before doing so. \" though virani had hoped the court would order the hospital to stop feeding shanbaug, it instead sided with hospital bosses, who argued shanbaug \" accepts food... And responds by facial expressions. \" but the bbc notes the case did lead to a loosening of \" some restrictions on euthanasia. \" a terminally ill patient in india can now be taken off life support in exceptional circumstances if family members want that to happen.

Some snippets: obama letter to mcnear: \" remember how i said there's a certain kind of conservatism which i respect more than bourgeois liberalism — ( ts ) eliot is of this type.

As he put it himself dec­ades later during an interview in the oval office, \"i was leading a very ascetic existence, way too serious for my own good. \" in most outward ways, compared with what had come before, his life in new york was a minimalist one, without the sprawling cast of characters that had surrounded him at oxy and in hawaii and indonesia.

        "summary": "It would've been more financially prudent to blow up now-useless us military vehicles used in afghanistan instead of what the pentagon actually did: ship them back home. A gao report released yesterday and cited in usa today says that from october 2012 to october 2013, the army and marines sent 9,000 vehicles back to the us — at a cost of up to $ 107,400 per vehicle. But 1,034 of them were either unnecessary for domestic needs or too costly to repair and put back into service. Due to various vehicle sizes and shipping methods, the report gives a huge range for the total cost of shipping those \" potentially unneeded items \": $ 5.9 million to $ 111 million. The report says the army and marines may have flouted pentagon guidelines that call for all transportation costs to be considered before going on a shipping spree. Another option for unnecessary vehicles like these: give them to us allies. But an analyst from the center for strategic and budgetary assessments says that could ultimately prove to be an unwise move. \" when we leave vehicles with our partners, we run the risk of those vehicles falling into the wrong hands, as they have in iraq, \" the analyst told usa today in an email. This isn't the first time the pentagon has been on the hot seat for mismanaged funds: the military accrued more than $ 620 million in late fees for not returning on time shipping containers used to send supplies to iraq and afghanistan, the navy times reported in april.",

            "A cougar 4x4 medium mine protected vehicle. ( photo: handout photo from force protection industries ) washington — the army and marine corps may have wasted more than $ 100 million returning vehicles from afghanistan that they don't need over just a one-year period, according to a government accountability office report released tuesday. The services could have saved the money by blowing up the trucks or turning them over to allies, the report says. Over a one-year period, the army and marines returned 1,000 vehicles to the united states that the service didn't need, at a cost of as much as $ 107,400 per vehicle. The pentagon has made some progress in reining in its costs, gao notes, but not enough. \" however, due to ineffective internal controls, the army and marine corps may be incurring unnecessary costs by returning equipment that potentially exceeds service needs or is not economical to return and repair, \" the report says. \" this report is a troubling reminder that the department of defense has more work do in managing taxpayer dollars, \" said sen.

            "What gao found the department of defense ( dod ) has made some progress in its drawdown of equipment from afghanistan, but ongoing uncertainties about the future force in afghanistan could affect progress of the drawdown. Specifically, from october 2012 to october 2013, dod returned from afghanistan or destroyed 14,664 vehicles, an average of 1,128 vehicles per month. Future progress toward drawdown goals will depend on equipment turn-in rates, which, in turn, depend on having more information about the post-2014 force level and mission. In addition, over the course of the last 8 months of the above period, the number of vehicles turned in by units for the drawdown averaged 55 percent of what had been forecast. This is because some vehicles that had been forecast for turn-in were instead redistributed to other units in afghanistan. A senior dod official stated that units have retained equipment because of uncertainty regarding future operational needs in afghanistan. Once the post-2014 force level and mission are announced, these vehicle turn-in rates may increase. Dod has taken some steps to improve efficiencies and manage costs in its afghanistan drawdown processes. For example, u.s. Central command amended its drawdown instruction to allow for aggregation of equipment at u.s. Ports. According to dod officials, this will allow for shipment of equipment via rail, resulting in potential savings when compared with trucking costs. However"

The letter says that kylie stumbled upon lennox's music online and \" really [ liked ] what i heard! \" \" i find artists who i think have potential and get them in rotation on our station, \" kylie continues, urging annie to send over an mp3 of her \" latest single \" to vie for possible airplay at the discretion of \" glenn, \" the station's program director. While many are loling, the wrap offers a different take: that lennox inadvertently exposed a \" scam \" targeting unsigned artists as the letter tells lennox to consider signing up with an \" artist development firm \" the station is connected with. Lennox says much the same, commenting on facebook that while sharing the letter was \" obviously a bit of fun, \" her digital team gets hundreds of \" these kinds of scams \" each year.

Thankfully, the atlantic wire cracked the case, noticing that the post was an almost word-for-word copy of this onion article from monday, with just two changes: the dateline now reads \" tehran, \" and they omitted a phrase describing ahmadinejad as \" a man who has repeatedly denied the holocaust and has had numerous political prisoners executed. \" good catch, that.

        "summary": "The planet's greatest extinction — the permian mass extinction, or the \" great dying \" — wiped out around 90 % of marine species and two-thirds of those on land over 60,000 years. Some 252 million years later, researchers are explaining what happened — and it may not bode well for us. Essentially, the world's oceans became too acidic to sustain life, reports the los angeles times. Acidity levels were generally stable during the first 50,000 years of this phase, then accelerated in a big way when siberian volcanoes sent incredible amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — \" the final blow that drove the acidification, \" researcher matthew clarkson of new zealand's university of otago tells nature. The team was able to determine ocean conditions at the time through chemical analysis of rocks in the united arab emirates that once sat on the ocean floor. The fact that ocean acidification played a role in the extinction \" is a worrying finding, considering that we can already see an increase in ocean acidity today that is the result of human carbon emissions, \" clarkson says in a post at eureka alert. If emissions keep climbing, clarkson says the \" great dying \" could represent a worst-case scenario once again. More carbon entered the atmosphere during the extinction than enters it now from fossil fuels, but it's being added at a similar rate, say the researchers. The rate of carbon injection was key to the mass die-off, notes the la times, because species weren't able to adapt quickly enough. Scientists next hope to discover whether permian-era rocks elsewhere on the planet show similar evidence of acidification. ( some say another mass extinction is already under way. )",

            "The scientists think that massive amounts of carbon dioxide were released by what's known as siberian trap volcanism, which was then absorbed into the oceans, causing them to grow more acidic far too fast for ocean life to adapt. But they also found that there appeared to be two phases to the carbon influx. The first one, signaled by the carbon isotopes, was a slower process that took place over 50,000 years; but the second phase was fast and furious, dumping massive amounts into the ocean in just 10,000 years.",
            "Florilegius/sspl/getty earth's greatest extinction event happened in a one-two punch 252 million years ago. Research now suggests that the second pulse of extinction, during which nearly all marine species vanished from the planet, happened in the wake of huge volcanic eruptions that spewed out carbon dioxide and made the oceans more acidic. The work, published in science1, is the latest to try to pinpoint the causes of the ' great dying ', at the end of the permian period. The study uses chemical evidence in rocks from that period to calculate how quickly ocean chemistry shifted. Volcanoes in siberia belched so much co 2 in such a short period of time that the oceans simply could not absorb it all, says team leader matthew clarkson, a geochemist at the university of otago in dunedin, new zealand. Within just 10,000 years, ph levels in at least some of the world's oceans plummeted. \"there was already enormous pressure on life on the oceans, \" clarkson says. \"and suddenly we have what appears to be a rapid volcanic eruption, the final blow that drove the acidification. \" reflections in the water today, oceans are becoming more acidic as a result of the large amounts of co 2 produced by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels; the average ph has dropped by 0.1 units since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The great dying might represent a worst-case scenario for the future if co 2 emissions continue to rise, says clarkson. Other researchers have proposed all sorts of ideas for what caused the end-permian extinction, from oxygen-starved oceans to methane-belching microbes. Top contenders have included both the siberian volcanoes and acidifying oceans, separately or in sequence as the new study describes. In 2010, a study that examined calcium isotopes in ancient rocks found that oceans got more acidic during the end of the permian period2. But the latest work measures ph more directly than before, says clarkson. His team looked at the ratios of boron isotopes in permian-age rocks from the united arab emirates. Boron exists in sea-water in two forms, the relative amounts of which are controlled by how acidic or alkaline"

But that effort may be about to stall out as the french government, in keeping with the law, on monday made public all documents from that time now that 75 years have elapsed. In all, more than 200,000 declassified police and legal documents relating to what happened between september 1939 and may 1945 have been released, reports rfi. Smithsonian recalls the regime's origins: the franco-german armistice signed in the year of the invasion split the country in two, with pétain leading the puppet government in the \" unoccupied \" southern and eastern zones. In addition to the deportations, pétain oversaw the arrests of french resistance members; the bbc points out the release of police records could round out the story of what happened to jean moulin, a resistance leader who died after being taken and tortured by the nazis in 1943. And while rfi reports \" major revelations \" aren't anticipated, it does detail some of what was to be released: \" reports of tailing suspects, records of interrogations, and letters of denunciation. \" the new york times reports that some hope the release will also cast a new light on the long-vilified town of 25,000. As one historian tells the paper, \" the vichy regime was situated here, in the free zone, but the records clearly show that the greatest numbers of collaborationists were, in fact, in the occupied zone, including paris. \" ( the story of how a us soldier saved 200 jews has finally been told. )",

Some 57 % of blacks say oj likely did kill ex-wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ronald goldman, up from 16 % in 1995, while white support for oj's probable guilt has spiked from 69 % to 83 % over the same period, according to an abc news/washington post telephone poll of 1,003 randomly selected adults. Not all polls agree — a cnn poll found that only 36 % of blacks say he likely committed the murders — but any sign of black support for oj's guilt seems worth a closer look. The abc/washington post poll was taken before two recent tv series ( like espn's ) left the impression oj was guilty — so what gives? well, the former nfl superstar and actor has seen his public image decline amid road-rage charges and a conviction for kidnapping and armed robbery in a las vegas hotel room. Simpson was also found guilty in a civil trial for the deaths of goldman and brown simpson, the washington post points out. But carl douglas, who was on oj's murder-defense team, notes that more whites still believe simpson is guilty of murder. \" i suspect until the end of time, until there's only one beige race, the belief of caucasian-americans will always be higher than african americans in oj simpson's guilt, \" he says.

In 1961, eric schlosser writes in an upcoming book excerpted in mother jones, a b-52 bomber went haywire over the state, and a pair of hydrogen bombs fell out. They were each 250 times stronger than the bomb dropped on hiroshima. One of the bombs wasn't armed when it dropped, thanks to a failsafe, but the other one nearly exploded when its safety gear failed. \" the arming wires were yanked out, and the bomb responded as though it had been deliberately released by the crew above a target, \" schlosser writes in command and control, an investigation of us nuclear mishaps. \" the bomb hit the ground, and the piezoelectric crystals inside the nose crushed. They sent a firing signal. \" of course, the bomb didn't ultimately explode. The air force said there was never a chance it would have, but that's not true, schlosser says. Today, schlosser tells mother jones in an interview, we've forgotten about the danger of these weapons: they \" are machines, and i think they are the most dangerous machines ever invented, \" he says. \" and like every machine, sometimes they go wrong. \" the book is out tomorrow, the raw story reports.

        "summary": "Airports invested hundreds of millions of dollars in perimeter security after 9/11, and although not a single terrorist made it through, that might be because none tried, according to an ap investigation. Since 2004, there have been at least 268 perimeter breaches at america's 31 busiest airports, with intruders including drunk drivers, people taking shortcuts, stowaways, skateboarders, a mentally ill man who hopped the fence eight times at lax in the space of less than a year, and a man who went through washington's reagan national airport to recharge his boat's battery after it failed, according to an ap snapshot of cases. The intruders sneaked past security posts, rammed gates, climbed fences, and, in one case in florida, dug under a fence. At least 44 intruders made it as far as runways or gate areas, according to the ap, which notes that the total is probably an undercount: two airports didn't provide full information, and boston's logan airport refused to provide any at all for security reasons. Airport officials say the fact that intruders were caught shows that security systems generally work well, although for security reasons, not many airports would say how long it took to catch them. San francisco was the most breached airport in the years looked at, with 37 cases, with lax and san jose international airport also high on the list, reports the los angeles times. A teen stowaway who climbed a fence at san jose survived a flight to hawaii inside a wheel well.",

Yesterday's republican proposal was basically the same as one obama rejected a week ago, but his own proposal monday was similarly distasteful to republicans: it demanded $ 1.4 trillion in new taxes over the next decade. That's down from his initial demand for $ 1.6 trillion, but up from the $ 1.2 trillion he signaled he was open to during a weekend meeting with boehner. Republicans are waiting for the president to propose big entitlement cuts, and he's waiting for republicans to propose higher tax rates for the wealthy; boehner's offer includes $ 800 billion in new revenue, but none from raising rates. The standoff had harry reid warning yesterday that it now looks \" extremely difficult to get [ a deal ] done before christmas. \" politico reports that the two sides are \" hundreds of billions of dollars apart, \" and sources say they're actually getting further apart as talks continue. Obama's latest proposal, for example, offered $ 600 billion in entitlement cuts, while boehner's called for more than $ 1 trillion. One potentially positive note: sources tell both politico and the post that the white house offered to reform the corporate tax code, an issue that is important to republicans. But no specifics were offered, so the overture isn't expected to seal a deal, the wall street journal reports.",

Alain robert, a 55-year-old known as the \" french spider-man, \" had been trying to climb the 123-story lotte world tower in seoul with his bare hands — and no ropes — when somebody spotted him well into the unauthorized ascent. Staffers then began pursuing him, though from safely inside the building. \" i climbed about 75 stories and then after that, it was a bit like cat and mouse, \" robert tells the afp. \" finally, i decided to surrender. \" at that point, robert was escorted to the roof of the building via an outside maintenance lift and arrested. \" i may get a hefty fine... But i did it because of what is happening now between south korea and north korea, \" he said, referring to the recent peace developments and expressing thanks to the leaders of the respective countries. It wasn't immediately clear whether the world-peace claim would ease his penalty. Robert has previously climbed landmarks such as the eiffel tower and the sydney opera house, along with some of the tallest buildings in the world, including the burj khalifa in dubai. He would not have been the first to scale the lotte world tower, notes the korea herald. Two unauthorized climbers beat him to it in 2016. ( this urban \" spider-man \" saved a life. )",

After she wrote about her experience on salon last year, she was contacted by three other moms. One left her 8-year-old daughter to watch her sleeping 4-year-old daughter in the car for a few minutes on a 45-degree day and got arrested. Another left her daughter in her car in front of a rite aid for three minutes and returned to find a woman who called her \" disgusting \" and informed her she'd called the police. The third left her sleeping 3-year-old in the car, parked in a shady spot with windows cracked on a 70-degree day, and was later arrested after witnesses informed police. When brooks thinks about the \" good samaritans \" in these cases, she writes on salon, she feels \" sadness and regret at how little any of us know about each other's lives. \" these people are \" resisting the anonymity of modern life, wanting to help but unsure of what to do, of how to reach out or engage.... We're raising our kids in a moment when it's easier to call 911 than to have a conversation. \" of course, there are the facts — statistically, a moving vehicle is more dangerous to a child and a family member is more likely to abduct a child — but brooks ' plea goes beyond that. Take a moment before you judge, she writes, because \" there is a moral vigilantism about parenting that, as with all forms of vigilantism, veers far into paranoia, \" and sometimes it seems we've \" entirely forgotten how to interact with other human beings, or talk to strangers from a place of openness and curiosity, rather than fear. \" click for her full piece.",

        "summary": "What looked like a pile of weirdly gray rocks was actually something far more significant: a fossil dating back to the dinosaurs, the las cruces sun-news reports. Jeff dornbusch, a museum volunteer, noticed the gray mound while hiking in new mexico's brown desert landscape more than ten years ago, but couldn't relocate it until 2012. Once two experts confirmed the discovery — a turtle of the genus adocus, from the cretaceous period 146 to 65 million years ago — a team began the delicate process of removing it. Soon they were finding a piece of spine amid the shell fossil; then they applied plaster to the 2.5-foot diameter chunk of dirt and began transporting it to the new mexico museum of natural history for display. How much remains of the prehistoric creature is unknown. \" it just looked like a pile of gray rocks out here, \" says dornbusch. \" i never really knew this area as a place for marine fossils. \" but the rocky soil, mesquite bushes, and desert grass in southern new mexico was \" a swampy, near-shore environment \" tens of millions of years ago, a fossil expert says. In fact, the natural history museum in albuquerque has some 25,000 fossils that are protected by federal law. So dornbusch was smart: those who don't report such finds can \" face stiff penalties, \" the sun-news notes. Another unlikely find: an amateur paleontologist in argentina discovered a 500,000-year-old giant ground sloth on his property that, amazingly, still has its skull and teeth intact ( which will enable experts to decode the extinct creature's dna ), tech times reports.

            "In argentina's coastal city mar del plata, a paleontologist discovered a giant ground sloth fossil while digging and cleaning a well in his property. Carlos menduga unearthed some ribs, vertebrae, skull, and other fossilized remains of a giant ground sloth believed to be from the pre-historic era. According to representatives from the lorenzo scaglia natural history museum the fossils were found by manduga as he was tending to a well in his house in mar del plata, which is situated about 249 miles south of buenos aires. \" the paleontological remains are about 500,000 years old and are of a scelidotherium leptocephalum, a giant ground sloth, \" confirmed museum director analia veron. The giant ground sloth is a creature with claws so huge it can dig up deep tunnels measuring over a meter wide and as long as dozens of meters. These tunnels were so massive that real cities underground can be fashioned out of them. The giant ground sloth has long succumbed to extinction, no thanks to be being overly hunted by humans and climate change around 8,000 years ago. Finding giant ground sloth fossils is actually common but manduga's discovery deserves merit because it features a skull with teeth, allowing researchers to learn more or nearly everything about the creature's dna.

She did, however, appear in a video message in which she introduced the new video for her latest single, \" delicate, \" and the washington post notes that the video itself could explain her absence.

Their study found that referrals for genetic counseling in the uk increased by 2.5 times after jolie revealed her surgery, and were still at almost twice their previous levels through october. Referrals for genetic testing jumped as well, with seven regional genetics centers seeing an 80 % increase in full brca1/2 between july 2013 and december 2013 compared to the year prior. And, though some had been concerned the jump might be attributed to nervous patients seeking a second referral after hearing jolie's story, researchers write \" internal review shows that there was no increase in inappropriate referrals. \" the researchers note that other celebrities have caused similar increases, such as an upswing in colonoscopies after katie couric's colorectal cancer awareness campaign. But jolie seems to have had a larger impact, \" possibly due to her image as a glamorous and strong woman, \" says a researcher quoted by the bbc. \" this may have lessened patients ' fears about a loss of sexual identity post-preventative surgery and encouraged those who had not previously engaged with health services to consider genetic testing. \"",

Awareness of the angelina jolie story was not associated with improved understanding. However, 9 % of women were motivated to do something about their health, such as seeing a doctor, having a mammogram or seeing a genetic counselor. The increased level of appropriate referrals in the uk may reflect a similar effect. The authors concluded that although celebrities can bring heightened awareness to health issues, there is a need for these messages to be accompanied by more purposeful communication efforts to assist the public understanding. There is no evidence from the current study that the story led to inappropriate referrals although it is possible that primary care physicians had to see many women who were unnecessarily worried about breast cancer, or observed an increased need for brca testing in the months following the revelation. It is likely that the release of nice guidance with the attendant publicity may have made it easier to deal with the onslaught of enquiries about familial breast cancer. It is also likely that given the high level of appropriate referrals received in clinics,"
