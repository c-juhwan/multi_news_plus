But he decided to give it a go — keeping a blog to track the experience — less to find out if he could look like the rock than if he could work as hard as the rock. \"that dude works really really hard, \" webster says. \"the fact that he looks like this and trains like this every day of his life while making his movies, being on set 14 hours — that kind of discipline to me is absolutely amazing. \" everyday, webster ate about 10 pounds — or $ 42 worth — of food, mostly cod, steak, chicken, eggs, veggies, and potatoes. Spending 90 minutes pre-preparing meals every few days and finding time to eat seven times a day proved to be the biggest hassle. \"i had business meetings at a different office, \" webster says. \" i had to bring three meals with me and eat in a conference room. \" all told, he averaged about five hours per day working out, making meals, and eating. In return he got leaner, gained muscle, and more. \" i ' m 37, \" he says. \" i get little aches and pains all the time; i have none of those anymore. I feel better than i did before i was doing this. \" plus he gained a new fan. \" impressed by this discipline, \" the rock, himself, tweeted this week. \" harder than one would think. #bringonthecheatmeals. \" read the full story here, or check out the rock's ' 80s-style workout video.",

It adds, \" knowing benedict, it is also quite possible that he has accepted an invitation to stay on longer for a tribal ceremony — it can also be considered an insult to refuse. \" ( this woman tweeted something eerie before being killed on her amazon trek. )",

Now that shell, recovered from a riverbank in indonesia in 1891, could alter our understanding of what it means to be human. Artistic creativity has long been considered unique to homo sapiens: before the shell's discovery, the earliest evidence of geometric art came in the form of rock scratches dated to no older than 100,000 years ago, national geographic reports. But this latest find, described in nature, is \" at least four times as old, \" a study author tells npr. In fact, it dates to the time of homo erectus, a species older than neanderthals that's described by the smithsonian as being \" the oldest known early humans to have possessed modern human-like body proportions. \" the shell was never described by its finder, but seven years ago, josephine joordens and a colleague noticed the zigzag marking. She began studying it and ruled out that it was made naturally or by animals. As she tells nature, there aren't any gaps in the engraving, suggesting it was \" made by an agent who did a very deliberate action. \" further, her team tried to re-create the pattern and discovered it was pretty tough to do so. As for whether it should be considered art, joordens says it's really impossible to say since we don't know \" the intention of the person who made it. \" an anthropology professor is even more hesitant to see it as a sign that homo erectus was capable of artistic creativity: \" if this is symbolic behavior by homo erectus, then it's basically the only evidence we've got [ of that ] for a species that lived for a million-and-a-half years on three continents. \" ( cave paintings are also changing the story of ancient art. )",

            "Early african homo erectus fossils ( sometimes called homo ergaster ) are the oldest known early humans to have possessed modern human-like body proportions with relatively elongated legs and shorter arms compared to the size of the torso. These features are considered adaptations to a life lived on the ground, indicating the loss of earlier tree-climbing adaptations, with the ability to walk and possibly run long distances. Compared with earlier fossil humans, note the expanded braincase relative to the size of the face. The most complete fossil individual of this species is known as the 'turkana boy ' – a well-preserved skeleton ( though minus almost all the hand and foot bones ), dated around 1.6 million years old. Microscopic study of the teeth indicates that he grew up at a growth rate similar to that of a great ape. There is fossil evidence that this species cared for old and weak individuals.

        "summary": "Security researchers say a leading suspect in the massive ransomware attack is a familiar one: north korea. Researchers at google, symantec, kaspersky lab, and comae technologies say an early version of the wannacry software contains code similar to that used by the pyongyang-linked lazarus group in a 2015 cyberattack, the wall street journal reports. Researchers say it could be the case that the attackers simply copied the code, or included it so that north korea would be blamed for the attack, though the fact that it was removed from the final version of the software, which has hit at least 200,000 computers worldwide, seems to rule out the latter theory, the guardian reports. The copied code isn't proof on its own, but \" this is the best clue we have seen to date as to the origins of wannacry, \" kaspersky researcher kurt baumgartner tells reuters. Whoever the culprits are, they made some amateurish mistakes that severely limited their take from the scheme, experts tell wired. The errors include a \" kill switch \" that a british security researcher was able to activate for $ 11, and flaws that experts believe make it impossible for the criminals to know who has paid the ransom. \" from a ransom perspective, it's a catastrophic failure, \" says cisco security researcher craig williams. The attack is believed to have brought in just $ 55,000, a fraction of the millions that smaller attacks have netted.",

We did it, \" said david reitze, the executive director of the ligo ( laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory ) project. He then went into an explainer: \" these gravitational waves were produced by two colliding black holes that merged to form a single black hole 1.3 billion years ago \" and detected by ligo on sept 14, 2015; ligo's two observatories, in washington and louisiana, recorded a signal \" nearly simultaneously, \" said reitze. The new york times reports on what happened in layman's terms: \" conveyed by these gravitational waves, an energy 50 times greater than that of all the stars in the universe put together vibrated a pair of l-shaped antennas \" in those observatories. The machinery moved \" by 1/1000 of the width of a proton particle. Ligo detected it. Amazing, \" declares the guardian. After months of \" careful checking, rechecking, analysis...

It's a huge accomplishment, but reitze emphasized that so much of what is exciting about this is where we go from here. \" four hundred years ago, galileo turned a telescope to the sky and opened the era of modern observational astronomy, \" he said, adding that today, we, too, open a new scientific era.",

        "summary": "The crash that wiped out a large family traveling along california's pacific coast highway last week may have been murder-suicide, not an accident. Nbc news reports that police say they've uncovered disturbing signs that the vehicle carrying married couple jennifer and sarah hart and their six adopted children was driven over a cliff intentionally. Capt. Greg baarts with the california highway patrol said sunday night that information from the 2003 gmc yukon's software shows that it was stopped at a gravel pullout around 70 feet from the cliff's edge before it accelerated over the edge and plunged around 100 feet, the ap reports. He said the suv's speedometer was pinned at 90mph when it went over the cliff. Baarts said no suicide notes were found in a search of the family's home. The family had driven more than 500 miles south from their washington state home. Baarts told reporters that the electronic data and the fact that there were no skid marks or other signs that the driver tried to brake has led investigators to believe the crash was deliberate. The bodies of the parents, both age 38, and markis, 19; jeremiah, 14; and abigail, 14, were found at the site where the suv hit ocean rocks. Still missing are hannah, 16; devonte, 15; and sierra, 12. Authorities believe they weren't wearing seat belts and may have been washed out to sea. Baarts said police could \" be looking at a variety of felony crimes \" to investigate, but at this point, they \" can't tell you definitively what crime was committed, \" reports the washington post.

When wall found out she was pregnant last year after a fertility treatment, bunker decided to take a pregnancy test as well, per abc news affiliate ktvx. \" that afternoon i got this harebrained idea that what if i was pregnant, \" she says. \" we weren't doing any fertility treatments of any kind. \" doctors had thought bunker's chances of getting pregnant on her own were practically nil, kutv notes. Even though wall gave birth about a month before her twin, her babies were premature, so she was already at the hospital when bunker arrived to deliver. \" i said we're already here, so we ' ll walk down the hall, \" she tells ktvx. The 36-year-old women say they aren't just sisters, but also best friends and co-workers at the same school — and now the bunkers are building a house next door to the walls. Bunker also has a 2-year-old child, and the sisters say their nine kids will grow up together. \" two seniors, a junior, and two freshmen! \" bunker says to kutv, extrapolating into the future for her own kids. \" i said, we are not going to be able to afford them! not to mention three boys.

Because i've done it. \" among the highlights: \" not a one of us [ candidates ] deserves the job by right of resume, party, seniority, family, or family narrative, \" he said, apparently distancing himself from the bush lineage. \" it's nobody's turn. \" guess that means it's not hillary clinton's, either: \" i, for one, am not eager to see what another four years would look like under that kind of leadership, \" he said, per the hill. \" the presidency should not be passed on from one liberal to the next. \" he also criticized the obama years, referring to a \" phone-it-in foreign policy \" and dismissing obama's cuba policy: \" we don't need a glorified tourist to go to havana in support of a failed cuba, \" bush said. He also touted the importance of school choice, despite his earlier backing of common core standards. \" every parent should have the right to send their child to a better school — public, private, or charter, \" he said, adding that the government \" should have nothing to do with setting school standards. \" and he set \" some bold goals \" for a jeb bush presidency, politico reports, saying he would aim for 4 % domestic growth each year and energy security for the country within 5 years. Overall, bush presented himself \" as a counterpoint to a republican party that has struggled to connect with minority voters \" in the last two presidential elections, the new york times says. He also promised to stick with his principles, \" an implicit attack \" on gop candidates who have adjusted their views to suit core conservatives.

The abuse was reported to school officials by a student as far back as at least 1966, reports the honolulu star-advertiser, which has a timeline of events. Regardless, browne was still a psychiatrist for kamehameha schools in 1991 when he killed himself after being confronted by a former victim. Even then school officials failed to investigate accusations against browne, some of whose victims killed themselves. \" it's a lot of dollars, but there are a lot of people who wouldn't trade places with them, \" a lawyer for the victims says of the settlement, which will also create a hotline to report abuse and a recovery fund for sexual assault victims. \" i ' m excited that the men stood with me to do this, \" one of browne's victims says. \" we stood together and we were strong. \"",

The identity of the assailant and motive for the killing were unclear. The press service for the gendarmes, or military police, couldn't say whether the incident was linked to a terrorist act. Security at religious and other sites has been increased after a string of islamic extremist attacks on france. A gendarme service spokesman said early friday that more than 100 members of the security forces were dispatched to the village of montferrier-sur-lez, near the city of montpellier in the southern tip of france"

It's just a shame we ' ll never know the name of the sumerian genius to whom we owe blazing saddles.

Pitchfork notes that at the time the movie was in production, reports surfaced of issues on the set between bjork and von trier — including one incident in which she reportedly tore up a shirt and ate pieces of it — and in a 2011 gq interview, von trier admitted to the \" violent hostility \" between the two of them while filming. Bjork noted in her post that after she stood up to her director, \" he had a more fair and meaningful relationship with his actresses after my confrontation so there is hope. … let's stop this … there is a wave of change in the world. \"",

Tampa, florida ( reuters ) - republican presidential candidate newt gingrich, coming off one of his most subdued debate performances of the campaign, signaled on tuesday he may skip future debates unless his supporters are given full license to clap, cheer and roar. Gingrich complained that nbc news moderator brian williams had told the crowd to be silent before monday's debate in tampa in an effort to stifle",
            "This was a boring debate. Perhaps it was the atmospherics. Under strict instructions from the moderators, the crowd abstained from applause, boos, or the helps of a gathering lynch mob on display in south carolina. The quiet room made every line land softly. As a result the participants came off more like a sober think-tank panel than a pack of crazed, fearmongering gladiators performing before a crowd baying for the blood of president obama, immigrants, and gay people. I find the latter impression more accurate. Rick santorum finally failed to complain about his",
            "Republican debate winner in florida? nobody who watched this was like high-stakes dominoes, but less gripping. ( chip somodevilla - getty images ) well, that was a terrible waste of an evening. Worried you missed the republican debate? you shouldn't be. Perhaps you watched real housewives instead. You missed nothing. In fact, i envy you, and i never expected i would use the phrases \"i envy you \" and \"you watched real housewives \" in the same thought. \"cane sugar hides behind beet sugar, \" newt gingrich noted at one",
            "This debate was a historic mile marker on the road to obsolescence for network broadcast television. It was the least informative republican primary debate so far — largely due to the supercilious brian williams, who did his best interpretation of a paleolithic network anchor trying to prevent republicans from talking about what they might talk were they on a livelier cable-television network or an internet site. Still, rick santorum did have an opportunity in this debate to run to daylight — while mitt romney and newt gingrich inanely grappled with each other at the line of scrimmage. Yet santorum failed",
            "Newt got hammered. The lobbying/influence peddling line of attacks from romney cues new and old media for the next three days. What did he do, when did he do it, for whom, and for how much? $ 25,000 a month to be a historian isn't going to fly, and the push-back to romney was weak. Newt would like john king to send in a question via twitter."

What provoked the attack: mother and son fighting over his grades at the university of alabama at birmingham, tyler reportedly told police; his dad was said to have been at work at the time of the killing. Tyler blansit has since been charged with murder and is being held in the dekalb county detention center. When police first showed up at the blansit home on friday, they found a crime scene that mentone police chief brad gregg described as \" brutal, \" al.com reports. Tyler initially told cops that he and his mom had been attacked, offering up his own scratches and bump on the head as evidence, the times-journal reports. But tyler admitted later on to hitting his mother, dekalb county sheriff jimmy harris tells al.com; sherry blansit appeared to have died from blunt force trauma to the head, and a baseball bat cops believe was the murder weapon is being tested, the sheriff adds.

Archivist daniel michelson stumbled upon the six strands of \" gray-white \" hair, tied with thread, inside an envelope tucked into the leather-bound book during a recent inventory review, reports usa today. How did it get there? as fox news reports, the book at one point belonged to the son of gen. Philip schuyler. In addition to being one of the college's founders and a close friend of washington who served under him during the revolutionary war, schuyler was also alexander hamilton's father-in law, per a release. Since locks of hair were then given as keepsakes, experts believe martha washington gave it to hamilton's wife, her close friend eliza. An inscription on the envelope, describing it as \" washington's hair, \" suggests eliza gave it to her third son, james, who then gave it to his granddaughters, louisa lee schuyler and georgina schuyler. While it's impossible to confirm the hair belonged to washington — who didn't wear a wig and used powder to turn his reddish-brown hair white in his younger days, per national geographic — manuscripts dealer john reznikoff says it's \" undoubtedly \" his and likely worth up to $ 3,000, per usa today.

And to try to gain an edge, the retailer behemoth is testing a new scheme: having employees drop off packages to customers on their way home, reports quartz. The idea is to save money on the dreaded \" last mile \" of the order-and-delivery process, which can be the most expensive part of the chain. \" it just makes sense, \" walmart exec marc lore writes in a blog post. \" once they're done working at the store for the day, they pick up the packages from the backroom, load them into their vehicle, enter the delivery addresses into the gps on their phone and head toward home. \" workers will get paid extra for their trouble, but walmart didn't disclose details on that, notes cnbc. Lore calls it \" creating efficiencies in our business, \" and he clearly hopes that by having employees deliver shipments straight to the doors of customers, shipping costs will be cut as deliveries are more streamlined and speedy. The pilot project is starting in three cities in new jersey and arkansas, and lore notes that walmart \" associates \" can choose to participate or not. Walmart has developed an app just for this pilot test, and quartz speculates that this test may be an early sign that the company's experiment hiring lyft and uber drivers as couriers is coming to an end.

With congress seeking official numbers on immigrant/child separation along the southwest border and officials refusing to provide it, the times dug up federal data showing that over 700 children ( 100 of them under age 4 ) have been separated from adults in the past six months. The department of homeland security eventually acknowledged the numbers but said it was to \" protect the best interests of minor children crossing our borders \" and not to deter illegal immigration. Such children torn from families are sheltered by nongovernmental organizations, which try to find a us guardian or relative to take the child — but if none emerge, the child can remain stuck in custody. Last year, as secretary of homeland security, john kelly floated the idea of child/guardian separation at borders, telling cnn he was considering it \" in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network.... They will be well cared for as we deal with their parents. \" indeed there have been fraud cases, with some migrants admitting they brought children only to be admitted into the us more easily. Now the aclu has filed a lawsuit on behalf of immigrant parents trying to stop such border separations.",

Jones ' car broke down on the side of the highway in the early hours of oct. 18. Neither his bandmate nor a mechanic could get it started, but jones — who played in a local reggae band as well as for his church — didn't want to leave his drum set behind, according to the sun sentinel. The palm beach post reports jones was on the phone with at&t roadside assistance around 3: 15am when raja arrived. Raja, who was on duty but not in uniform, was driving an unmarked white van. Investigators say he never identified himself as a police officer. What happened next was recorded on jones ' roadside assistance call. Raja asks jones if he's \" good \" multiple times. Jones says he is. Then raja tells jones to put his \" fucking hands up \" three times. At one point, jones tells raja to \" hold on. \" within two seconds following his final command, raja fired three shots at jones. He fired another three 10 seconds later. Jones had a gun on him — and was licensed to carry it — but investigators determined he was running away from raja when he was shot. His gun was found 120 feet from his body. \"the intent of discharging his firearm was to kill corey jones, \" the sun sentinel quotes the investigation as stating.

The wall street journal reveals the hedge fund manager and hillary clinton supporter misread what the stock market was going to do after the election and said goodbye to almost $ 1 billion. Soros, who'd already been leery of the market before nov. 8, became more so after trump won. But as business insider notes, the dow jones is up almost 10 % since election day, while all three main us stock indexes ( the dow, plus the s&p 500 and nasdaq ) have set record highs, meaning soros ' bearish money-managing approach led his personal portfolio to take a huge dive ( though he did stem the hemorrhaging and get out of many of his positions before 2016 came to a close ). Soros fund management's portfolio overall did better, helping the firm claim a 5 % gain on the year. Meanwhile, one-time soros protege stanley druckenmiller, who served as soros'deputy for years at the quantum fund, took a different tack, theorizing that if hillary clinton won, stocks would rise, then fall, while the opposite would happen if donald trump pulled off a win. Druckenmiller obviously proved right, and because he had dumped his bearish positions the night of the election, his firm duquesne family office llc boasted gains of 10 % in 2016. It doesn't appear as if druckenmiller jumped on the trump train for any reason other than economic potential: he had previously said trump had an \" unstable personality \" and even indicated he might not vote in the election; a few days after the election, he told cnbc he didn't vote for trump or clinton.

        "summary": "There has been no shortage of criticism surrounding the release of bowe bergdahl, and a now-deleted tweet is joining the roster of things being picked apart. As the washington post reports, bergdahl's father, bob, last week tweeted the following: \" i am still working to free all guantanamo prisoners. God will repay for the death of every afghan child, ameen. \" though it has since been scrubbed from twitter — without explanation, though the media has asked — it was apparently directed at a taliban rep and was posted only four days before news of the prisoner exchange broke. And it has some of those critics railing against the bergdahls and their perceived \" contempt for their own country, \" writes the post. More: bergdahl was a frequent topic of question at a press conference president obama held in warsaw, poland, today, and politico has some standout lines, on the administration's moves ( \" regardless of the circumstances, whatever those circumstances may turn out to be, we still get an american soldier back if he's held in captivity. Period. Full stop. We don't condition that. \" ); on what bergdahl was doing when he was captured ( \" we obviously have not been interrogating sgt. Bergdahl. He is recovering from five years of captivity with the taliban. \" ); and on whether he could possibly be court-martialed for desertion ( \" that's not something that we're discussing at this point because our main priority is making sure that the transition that he is undergoing after five years of captivity is successful. \" ) joint chiefs chair martin dempsey was less cagey, telling the ap today that the army may yet pursue desertion charges against bergdahl. What was the turning point amid years of negotiations? sources tell the ap there was no singular breakthrough, but that two terms of the swap were changed in the final days of negotiations: the taliban agreed the freed detainees wouldn't leave qatar for a year — it had been pushing for exemptions for things like medical reasons — and the us agreed to release all five detainees at once, not one or two at a time as previously offered.

The post-standard reports that on sunday evening, jeremy dufresne ( aka jeremy young ), a homeless man whose family says he has epilepsy and schizophrenia, had come inside the dunkin'to warm up and charge his cellphone so he could call his mother, which he does each night. As he waited for the phone to juice up, he put his head down, which is when a video that's since gone viral captured what happened next: a dunkin ' worker dumped a pitcher of water on dufresne, while someone laughed in the background. \" how many times i've got to tell you to stop sleeping in here, \" the employee says as dufresne scrambles to his feet and tries to collect himself, his phone, and his charger. \" you know i ' m not playing with you. \" after the video circulated, per usa today, a homeless advocate organized a protest outside the store, and the company that owns that dunkin'donuts said it fired the employees involved and will help better train other workers \" how to engage with homeless individuals. \" the post-standard reports the onondaga county da is investigating and that the workers could get hit with harassment charges. \" he probably had some personal problems of his own and … took it out on someone else, like me, \" dufresne says. His aunt, meanwhile, tells spectrum news she's \" appalled, \" and that her nephew is a \" caring \" person who's been harassed before and whom she's tried to have live with her; dufresne tells the post-standard he prefers to live outside. A gofundme created to \" help [ jeremy ] get on his feet \" has raised more than $ 5,500. ( there was recently hubbub at a baltimore dunkin'donuts. )",

Ben carson was among those who spoke in support of trump, though not with great enthusiasm: he said he initially thought \" maybe the best thing would be to remain neutral, \" but he decided it was time for the party to unite behind a candidate.",

Continue reading below during a conference call wednesday, sen. Orrin hatch ( r-ut ) suggested to white house officials, including chief of staff reince priebus, that garland should be under consideration to replace james comey as fbi director after he was abruptly fired from the post last tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter. Priebus agreed, according to numerous sources, and said including garland on the list of candidates was \"worthy of a conversation and consideration. \" the other officials on the call, the same people who spoke with sen. Mike lee ( r-ut ) in a private meeting last wednesday, had a mixed reaction to the idea of garland leading the fbi. When asked about garland being considered as a possible comey replacement during the white house briefing on monday, press secretary sean spicer did not confirm or deny that he's being considered for the job and referred all questions to the department of justice. \"the search for the fbi director is being handled by the department of justice.

Elizabeth's psychiatric hospital after a judge ruled in august that the 61-year-old was no longer a threat to the public or himself. Doctors say the depression and psychosis with which hinckley was diagnosed following his 1981 assassination attempt are in remission, according to reuters. Hinckley pleaded insanity after wounding reagan and three others outside a washington dc hotel. He was attempting to impress actor jodie foster, with whom he was obsessed. Hinckley's release was strongly objected to by reagan's family, including his daughter, who fears hinckley still has \" dark agendas. \" upon his release saturday, hinckley moved in with his mother in a gated community on a golf course in williamsburg, virginia. While nominally a free man, there are multiple conditions to his release, the ap reports. Hinckley is not allowed to drink or speak to the press. He can't search for information on his crimes online or create a social media account without permission. He must work or volunteer at least three times a week and continue his therapy. He's only allowed to drive 30 miles from home without supervision, and law enforcement will be tracking his movements. Hinckley can get his own place to live after a year, and he plans to register to vote. Hinckley's lawyer says he ' ll be a \" citizen about whom we can all be proud. \"",

        "summary": "How goes president trump's plan to immediately repeal and replace obamacare? it seems to be getting gummed up in the realities of dc politics. Trump himself acknowledged sunday in an interview on fox news that things might stretch into 2018. \" it's very complicated, \" he said. \" i would like to say by the end of the year at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year. \" related coverage: in a story about the delays, the new york times notes the shift among some gop lawmakers from \" replace \" to \" repair, \" and points out that lawmakers are facing angry crowds of people worried about losing coverage at town hall meetings — \" the mirror image of 2009, when tea party activists assailed democrats who supported the law. \" with this shift toward \" repair, \" the wall street journal reports on growing friction from conservative republicans in the house worried about losing momentum. The 40 members of the freedom caucus are agitating to push ahead with immediate repeal, which they see as the necessary first step. The journal story has this quote from heritage foundation exec dan holler: \"house action is sort of imperative to get this kick-started and going. I think the longer this drags on, the more people are starting to understand the chance of a repeal is slipping away. Certainly it's becoming harder and harder with each passing day. \" but more important than timing are the tough decisions republicans must make on substance, writes jennifer rubin at the washington post. Among them: \" if they are determined to get rid of the individual mandate, are they willing to defend near-universal ' access ' instead of near-universal coverage? \" house speaker paul ryan promises progress, though he avoids a time frame in this update of what's happening on capitol hill. Supporters of the affordable care act should avoid gloating, cautions an analysis at cnn. Remember that trump already signed an executive order aimed at undercutting the law, and while congress may seem to be softening on going further, the repair vs. Replace shift may be mere semantics. \" the risks to the program are very real in the coming months, \" writes julian zelizer. \" rather than listening to what republicans are saying, democrats would be better served to watch what they are actually doing. \"",

According to the ap, it made landfall just southeast of mcclellanville, south carolina, bringing with it a \" serious inland flooding event. \" the storm was blamed for at least four deaths in the us, all in florida. Matthew raked the georgia and south carolina coasts with torrential rain and stiff winds. But for most of its run up the us coastline, its center, or eye, mercifully stayed just far enough offshore that coastal communities didn't feel the full force of its winds. In many communities in the storm's wake, the reaction was relief that it was nowhere near as bad as many feared. At 10am, when matthew was centered about 30 miles southeast of charleston, its winds had dropped to 75mph, a category 1 storm. That was down from 145mph when the storm roared into haiti. It was moving at 12mph. Among the cities bracing for its effects later in the day were myrtle beach, south carolina, and wilmington, north carolina. From there, the storm was expected to veer out to sea and loop back around toward the bahamas, though as a much-weakened storm. North carolina gov. Pat mccrory warned people not to let their guard down just because matthew was losing steam.",

What does it take to actually rupture one's tendon messing around on a phone? reporting this week in the journal jama internal medicine, the doctors say he played \" candy crush saga \" on his smartphone \" all day for 6 to 8 weeks \" with his left hand, while relying on his right hand for other tasks. The doctors report that the man was experiencing \" chronic left thumb pain and loss of active motion \" as a result, though one of the doctors involved tells livescience the man didn't experience pain while playing. The patient ultimately underwent surgery to repair one of the two tendons that extend his index finger, at which point the rupture of what's called the \" extensor pollicis longus \" tendon became clearly visible to the surgeons. They even went so far as to conclude that \" the potential for video games to reduce pain perception raises clinical and social considerations about excessive use, abuse, and addiction. \" they're encouraging future research into pain reduction and its role in excessive gaming and addiction.

But armstrong williams added that rescinding the order is complicated. \" the person they contracted has already spent $ 14,000 making the table, \" he said. \" while his intentions are to cancel it, we have to see what happens. \" carson said in a statement that \" nobody was more surprised \" than he was about the furniture order, which may have violated a law requiring congressional approval for office refurbishment costs above $ 5,000. Whistleblower helen foster, former chief administrative officer at hud, says she was told \" $ 5,000 won't even buy a decent chair \" when she pointed out the limit. The guardian reports that when she was asked thursday whether trump is considering carson's future, press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said: \" in terms of if you are asking if he is getting rid of anyone in the cabinet, i ' m not aware of that. \" she added that hud is \" looking for another option that is much more responsible to taxpayer dollars. \"",

The story behind the strange series of events is about as classy as one would expect from icp: salon reports that last year, a former icp employee named andrea pellegrini sued the group and its record label for sexual harassment, accusing diamond of presenting her with what seemed to be a glass dildo, but which diamond has testified is simply a \" work of art. \" diamond told pellegrini she was going to need the dildo since she'd recently become single, she claims; he then followed that up with some decidedly lewd sexual comments. When pellegrini turned down the dildo, diamond said in a deposition, he gave it to kid rock. Now, rock is being subpoenaed to produce the dildo so it can be presented as evidence in the lawsuit, despite the fact that he says he's \" never heard of, seen, or met any people involved in this case. \" in a pair of epic vulgar letters posted on his website yesterday, rock took a stab at pretty much everyone, accusing pellegrini's \" scumbag \" lawyers of using his fame to get attention for the case, diamond of being a liar, and diamond's lawyers of being \" assholes \" who failed to clear up said lie. \" i've never met your client, and had i met your client i'd certainly remember if he tried to give me a glass f --- ing dildo, \" he writes. Pellegrini's lawyer insist they're just looking out for her. \" if standing up for women's civil rights makes you the scum of america, count me in, \" he tells the detroit free press.",

        "summary": "Staring at your smartphone, tablet, or computer screen for hours on end may not only be fueling your online addiction — it could be wreaking havoc on your eyesight. So says a new study out of the university of toledo, published in the scientific reports journal, and it's all because of the symbiotic relationship between a light-sensitive protein in our retinas and the blue light emitted from our digital devices. What happens when that blue light hits our eyes, per the chemists involved in the research: it triggers the protein, called retinal, to produce toxic molecules that kill off the eye's non-regenerative photoreceptor cells. And once those cells are dead, \" they're dead for good, \" study co-author kasun ratnayake says, per ctv news. The retinal and blue light definitely need each other to cause their damage, too: either one on its own wasn't found to kill cells. Over time, this process leads to age-related macular degeneration, which is the top cause of vision loss and can eventually lead to blindness. There is a vitaman e molecule called alpha tocopherol that exists in our eyes and is able to fend off such cell deaths, but it apparently doesn't wield the same fighting powers as we age or if our immune systems are compromised. As researchers explore how to combat the problem — eyedrops that slow down macular degeneration is one such therapy on the table — study co-author ajith karunarathne suggests that people not check their devices when they're in the dark and to wear special glasses that can keep blue light from slamming into the retina.

Macular degeneration macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss, affecting more than 10 million americans – more than cataracts and glaucoma combined. At present, macular degeneration is considered an incurable eye disease. Macular degeneration is caused by the deterioration of the central portion of the retina, the inside back layer of the eye that records the images we see and sends them via the optic nerve from the eye to the brain. The retina's central portion, known as the macula, is responsible for focusing central vision in the eye, and",

        "summary": "Researchers on a mission to gather information about whales and dolphins in the waters off tanzania inadvertently discovered that the eco-devastating practice of using explosives to catch fish is alive and well in the african country, national geographic reports. So-called blast fishing kills large numbers of fish — many of which sink to the bottom anyway — as well as destroying coral reefs and the animals that live in them. Blasts also injure and kill people. \" the number of fish has drastically reduced; we are not able to catch many fish like before, \" a fisherman, who uses traditional methods, told bbc news in a previous report. Listening to underwater recordings taken in march, researchers heard at least 10 blasts per day. \"we caught a snapshot, \" says tim davenport with the wildlife conservation society. A man speaking at a world wildlife fund meeting says he hears up to 50 blasts a day from his home in dar es salaam, according to allafrica.com. It's \" as if there is no government, \" he says. Introduced in tanzania in the 1960s, blast fishing was outlawed in the 1970s, according to national geographic. Nonetheless, the practice has persisted ( one blast, per the bbc, could net a $ 1,800 payday ) and has only increased in recent years. One reason: increased mining has made dynamite easier to get. In addition to the other consequences of blast fishing, tourism ( 17 % of tanzania's gdp ) suffers. Explosions and dead coral reefs do not make for a pleasant swim, davenport notes. Over the summer, the government launched a new task force to deal with wildlife crimes. But, per national geographic, similar attempts in the past have suffered from meager resources, confusion about the law, and light sentences for offenders.

Robertson won the academy award for best actor, was released in 1968. \"flowers for algernon \" went on to sell more than five million copies and to become a staple of english classes. It inspired television adaptations, one of which also starred mr. Robertson, and stage productions, including a musical and a play in korean. The story was written as a series of first-person progress reports by charlie gordon, a 32-year-old bakery worker with an intellectual disability who is chosen for an experimental operation to increase his intelligence. A white mouse named algernon had undergone the procedure and had become intelligent enough to solve mazes much faster than charlie.

Rebels blamed gadhafi loyalists and said they had made an arrest, but the circumstances surrounding the assassination of abdel fattah younes remain murky. Younes had served as gadhafi's interior minister before defecting to the rebels, but he had reportedly been summoned from the front lines for questioning that he still maintained ties to the gadhafi regime. He got shot before that questioning occurred. Younes also had been embroiled in a power struggle with another libyan commander.

        "summary": "Super tuesday wasn't quite the trump sweep some analysts had predicted, but he still won at least seven states, adding to what the washington post describes as a string of victories unprecedented in modern gop primaries. Because of the divide between republicans in the northeast and the south, no gop candidate has been able to rack up victories in alabama, georgia, massachusetts, tennessee, new hampshire, nevada, virginia, and south carolina — until now. Even ronald reagan failed to win massachusetts in 1980, while more recent candidates who went on to become the nominees struggled in the south. In other super tuesday developments: victories in texas and oklahoma will keep ted cruz's campaign alive and strengthen his case for being the only viable trump alternative, the new york times notes. Speaking to supporters in texas, he said a divided field would hand the nomination to the \" profane and vulgar \" trump, which would be a \" disaster for republicans, for conservatives, and for the nation. \" cruz needed to do a lot better to emerge from super tuesday with a real shot at the nomination, according to aaron blake at the washington post. He took his home state and neighboring oklahoma, but he was unable to win among evangelicals in other southern states, exposing him as a candidate whose \" appeal is very regional, rather than religious. \" with minnesota, marco rubio won his first state, but the timing was terrible, nate silver notes at fivethirty eight. The state was called late in the evening, long after the media narrative portrayed super tuesday as a disaster for him. Rubio is now focusing on florida, his home state, where failure to win on march 15 would probably doom his campaign, politico reports. \" florida, i know you're ready, \" he told supporters in miami-dade county tuesday evening, before the minnesota win was announced. \" the pundits say we're underdogs, i ' ll accept that. We've all been underdogs. This is a community of underdogs. This is a state of underdogs. This is a country of underdogs, but we will win. \" despite the glimmers of hope for cruz and rubio, trump remains well on his way to gaining an insurmountable delegate lead and the opposition remains divided, writes andrew prokop at vox. With major votes on march 15 approaching, the gop elites now have just 14 days to stop trump, he writes — and they haven't made much progress so far.",

A vehicle with a man and woman inside, both of whom were shot, was driven into the cosmopolitan hotel-casino's valet area; they were taken to a hospital, where the woman died. Another woman was found lying in the middle of the street with a gunshot wound; she also died at the same hospital.

        "summary": "A big win for brendan dassey: a federal appeals court panel has ordered wisconsin to retry the inmate within 90 days or set him free, courthouse news reports. The chicago-based 7th circuit panel upheld a ruling that overturned his conviction last year in the case made famous by netflix's making a murderer. Dassey, now 27, was 16 years old when he was arrested for allegedly helping uncle steven avery rape and murder theresa halbach. He was interrogated without a parent or lawyer present and in thursday's 2-1 ruling, judges wrote that the \" fact-feeding, the false promises, the manipulation of dassey's desire to please, the physical, fatherly assurances \" led to a confession that should not be considered voluntary. Dassey, who suffered from cognitive problems, recanted the confession but was sentenced to life in prison. Dissenting judge david hamilton said the ruling \" calls into question standard interrogation techniques that courts have routinely found permissible, even in cases involving juveniles. \" dassey's lawyers said they were elated by the ruling and will now work to get him back to his mother after 4,132 days in prison as of thursday, the ap reports. Wisconsin's justice department, which blocked dassey's release last fall, says it hopes the \" erroneous decision will be reversed \" by either the full 7th circuit court or the us supreme court, reports fox 6. ( a lawyer for avery says the real killer was halbach's ex-boyfriend. )",

Some details from the times and the journal, both of which make the requisite dick tracy comparisons: bendable, curved glass, which corning recently figured out how to make, will likely be used in the watch. Foxconn is involved, and is looking into how to make displays more power-efficient.

        "summary": "The incredible saga of zephany nurse has reached its end: the south african woman found guilty of snatching a 3-day-old zephany from her sleeping mother's hospital room in 1997 has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Prosecutors had sought 15, reports reuters. Judge john hlophe had harsh words for the 51-year-old, who has not been named so as not to reveal the identity she gave to zephany: \" one would have expected you to apologize but you chose not to. It's also very clear you have caused much harm to zephany. You have actually betrayed her‚ \" times live quotes him as saying. The bbc reports hlophe also cited the birthday celebrations the nurses held each year for their absent daughter, which were covered by the press and meant it was clear the family was still looking for her. She had \" all the time in the world \" to return zephany, he said, but she obviously did not, the bbc reports. The woman maintained a lady named sylvia \" handed a baby \" to her on april 30, 1997, at a train station as part of a prearranged adoption; hlophe said the \" court rejects [ that story ] with the contempt it deserves, \" reports the bbc. After south african schoolkids noticed a physical resemblance between two girls, a dna test in 2015 revealed that one of them was zephany and the other her younger sister. The unnamed woman, who lived just a few miles from celeste and morne nurse, was arrested. Iol reports zephany hasn't been allowed to see the woman who took her since the arrest; she continues to live with the woman's husband. Celeste and morne have indicated the reunion has been a strained one. Read more on the case, and the eerie symbolism of zephany's name, here.",

            "Cleveland, ohio -- lebron james fans, get ready to make some room in your closet for no. 6 jerseys. James told the plain dealer on monday that he's filed the paperwork with the nba office to switch his jersey number from no. 23 to no. 6 next season. He had to make the decision this week, the deadline to make the request to the nba is wednesday. James first brought up the idea in november, saying he wanted to give up no. 23 out of respect to his hero, michael jordan. At that time he said he was \" 50/50 \" on switching to no. 6, his olympic number and the day of the month his first son was born. That now seems to be 100 percent. \" i've done it, \" james said. \" i already sent it in. I ' m going to be no. 6. \" the nba does not have to fulfill the request, players who don't change teams have to apply to change their number in march before the previous season. However, the wave of new jersey sales the switch promises to trigger would likely be too enticing for the league to turn down. In 2006, kobe bryant requested his number to be changed from no. 8 to no. 24."

        "summary": "A minnesota runaway has been identified as one of the victims of serial killer john wayne gacy, an illinois sheriff's office announced in a wednesday news release. Cook county sheriff tom dart says that the remains of a person whose body was found under the crawl space of gacy's chicago-area home in 1978 are those of 16-year-old james \" jimmie \" byron haakenson. The teenager had left his home in 1976 and was last heard from in august of that year when he called his mother and told her he was in chicago. The pioneer press reports his mother reported him missing shortly thereafter, on sept. 2. Gacy was convicted of killing 33 young men and was executed in 1994. Haakenson was one of eight of gacy's victims who were buried without being identified. Dart's office exhumed the remains of all eight in 2011 in an effort to identify them using dna testing, reports the ap. Two siblings of the teen were among the scores of relatives of young men who vanished between 1970 and gacy's 1978 arrest who submitted saliva samples at dart's request. Dart says that there was a \" strong genetic association \" between the siblings and the teen's remains. Haakenson is the second of the eight victims to be identified. Months after dart had the bodies exhumed, his office announced that it had identified one of the victims as william george bundy, a 19-year-old construction worker. The investigation has also solved four cold cases that weren't related to gacy. Read about some of those cases here and here.",
