Some sections of the country's media could not distinguish between \" prurient interest and the public interest, \" shatter said."

It's those middle names that provide the clue about why the otherwise ordinary births are drawing national attention, reports wbtv. Back in 2015, hadley and gentry eddings were returning home from a wedding when their vehicle was hit by a truck whose driver admitted to distracted driving. Their 2-year-old son, dobbs, died in the crash, and hadley, who was 37 weeks pregnant at the time, was forced to give birth to son reed, who died after two days. The tragedy itself drew headlines, but more so when the eddingses publicly forgave the 28-year-old driver, per the charlotte observer. Matthew deans pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor death by vehicle and failure to reduce speed and was sentenced to 1 to 3 years in prison. Mom and the twins were all healthy after the births, and donors have raised more than $ 200,000 for the couple. Gentry eddings is a campus pastor, and hadley teaches 4-year-olds.

But harold's attorney, craig truman, argued in the trial that no evidence of murder was ever presented. What was presented: harold's inability to \" tell the same story twice, \" truman admitted. Prosecutors wrote in court documents that harold told several versions of his wife's death — like being too busy texting to really see her fall, checking texts with her when she slipped, and her falling while taking photos. Prosecutors also said he had visited the park nine times before toni's death, cbs denver reports, and had a map in his car marked \" x \" in pink where toni died. Worse, his first wife died in a gruesome accident in 1995, and he collected big life insurance payments in both cases. Harold wasn't charged in the death of first wife sandra lynn henthorn, but that case is now re-opened. Harold will be sentenced for toni's death on dec. 8.

All the articles together weave a storyline that seems more egregious than the individual parts that make it up. But at the core of it, there really are problems. And we should be able to talk about those problems with clarity. Vox's jeff stein created a concise framework about the scandal, so we made a cartoon that pinpoints the primary issues at play. First, let's walk through what actually happened to understand what exactly it was that clinton did, we need to understand what an email server is. It's the technical underpinning of the controversy.

But there apparently has been \" new information \" in the case, which has led the national park service to triple the reward for information leading to his whereabouts to $ 60,000. As an nps release explains, the 41-year-old fugate was working a jan. 13, 1980, shift at the southeastern arizona monument's visitor center when he set out on one of the trails. He was never seen again. In a 1981 article on the missing man, the new york times reported the 17-square-mile monument area was thoroughly searched, but that search didn't extend beyond those grounds. The douglas dispatch in 2010 reported that no items were missing from fugate's home to suggest he actively disappeared. The times reported that friends and family ( he left behind a wife ) suspected he came across a drug deal in progress — drug deals had been known to occur at the monument, which sits roughly 60 miles from the mexican border — and that the uniform and badge he was wearing caused those he encountered to panic and abduct him. \" i believe there is a 50 % chance that a homicide has occurred, \" an investigator with the cochise sheriff's office said at the time. The only lead was an acquaintance's report of seeing fugate sandwiched between two men in a pickup, though that stemmed from a quick glimpse that occurred as the vehicles passed each other at 50mph.

Trump was framed by the f.b.i. — joined the roster. Mr. Trump has weighed aloud in recent days to close associates whether to dismiss his lawyer ty cobb, who had pushed most strongly a strategy of cooperating fully with the special counsel investigation. The president reassured mr. Cobb that he had no plans to fire him, according to a person who spoke with the president late monday, in part to prevent a narrative that his team was in",

Marine scientists who stumbled on the find say it includes glass bottles, red bricks, ship timbers, a metal compass, an unglazed pottery jug, and an iron chain: \"lying more than a mile down in near-freezing temperatures, the site is undisturbed and well preserved, \" archaeologist bruce terrell said yesterday in a statement. Now the national oceanic and atmospheric administration will try to pinpoint the mystery ship's age, country of origin, and purpose. Scientists are loosely dating it to the early 19th century or revolutionary war period, but the purpose seems less clear. From photos and videos, scientists say it looks more like a trading vessel than a war ship — which \" could tell us far more because in many ways those hundreds of voyages, thousands of voyages, really wrote the history of america in a very powerful way at the same time we were advancing and expanding west, \" noaa official james delgado tells the news &amp; observer. He adds that the find \" is exciting, but not unexpected, \" because so many \" violent storms \" downed vessels in \" the graveyard of the atlantic \" off the carolinas; this one, however, was further out than most. The scientists, who study deep-sea methane seeps, spotted the wreck while scanning for lost equipment, and had been within 100 yards of the wreck at least four times before without noticing it.",

In fact, the county prosecutor calls the kits \" the greatest gold mine of information and leads for law enforcement that i have seen in my four-decade career, \" adding that 1,000 suspects may eventually be prosecuted, per a release. Along with that news comes a chilling finding: \" serial rapists are far more common \" than previously thought, says the task force involved with the project, which includes researchers from case western reserve university. A review of 243 sexual assault files found that 51 % were linked to serial offenders — 26 % of whom had previously been arrested for sexual assault and 60 % of whom were later arrested in an unrelated rape case. New york notes the figure is high because prosecutors prioritized cases linked to serial offenders. Still, \" our findings suggest it is very likely that a sexual offender has either previously sexually assaulted or will offend again in the future, \" a researcher says. \" investigating each sexual assault as possibly perpetrated by a serial offender has the potential to reduce the number of sexual assaults if investigations focus more on the offender than on single incidents. \" serial offenders were more likely to kidnap their victims — often strangers — and to use or threaten the use of weapons. Some 74 % also had a prior felony arrest and 95 % had a subsequent felony arrest, compared to 51 % and 78 % among one-time offenders, reports the independent. \" these are one-man crime waves. And now that we realize this, we cannot allow these kits to sit on shelves untested in the future, \" the prosecutor says. ( decades-old rape kits pointed to a serial rapist in houston. )",

Soon, the us and the rest of the world will unite in releasing albums on fridays, mashable reports. Frances moore, head of record-label group the international federation of the phonographic industry, says the international alignment \" is what our consumers want. Music fans live in the digital world of today … they want music when it's available on the internet — not when it's ready to be released in their country. \" what's more, she notes, the shift will allow for global anticipation of new releases, and perhaps it will cut down on piracy spawned when listeners illegally download material that hasn't yet appeared in their home countries. Tuesday was originally chosen in an effort to be fair, mashable notes via a 2006 book by gavin edwards. The goal was to ensure all stores, no matter how big or small or where they were located, could sell albums on the same day, even though some might receive the albums earlier than others. \" we figured if people got the product on monday, they could sell it on tuesday. And even if distributors got it on friday, they couldn't get it on sale in stores over the weekend, \" an exec says in the book. Friday was picked as the new day, moore writes, after market research showed customers wanted weekend releases. But a leading figure among britain's independent labels raises concern, the guardian reports; he fears \" a market in which the mainstream dominates, and the niche... Is further marginalized. \" ( it doesn't get much more mainstream than an artist who's topped the charts for six straight decades. )",

State officials fought for weeks to stop them, saying syrian refugees posed an unacceptable security risk after the deadly nov. 13 paris attacks. But two days after suing one resettlement agency, the international rescue committee, and federal officials, the state on friday withdrew its request for an order immediately stopping the refugees from entering texas. The lawsuit remains pending, and a judge could hear arguments in the case this week. Texas took in nearly 250 syrians before the paris attacks.

Central bank. \"i ' m not thrilled \" the fed is raising borrowing costs and potentially slowing the economy, he said in an interview with cnbc broadcast thursday. \"i don't like all of this work that we're putting into the economy and then i see rates going up. \" the dollar relinquished gains from earlier in the day and treasury yields dropped following the president's remarks. \" i am not happy about it. But at the same time i ' m letting them do what they feel is best, \" trump said. The fed has raised interest rates five times since trump took office in january 2017, with two of those coming this year under chairman jerome powell, the president's pick to replace janet yellen. In the interview, trump called powell a \"very good man. \" personal compliments aside, trump aimed his complaints at a government agency that enjoys a degree of independence from politics because its funding isn't subject to congressional appropriations.

And the opportunity rover is in the middle of it. That's of concern. The problem isn't the dust, but the darkness it creates. While the rover does have batteries, it's primarily solar-powered, and it's currently enveloped in what nasa calls \" a dark, perpetual night. \" space.com explains the fine line: opportunity's handlers need to keep its heaters running at a level that will prevent it from freezing without draining the batteries. Engadget provides a timeline: the storm was spotted june 1, the rover entered minimal operations mode by june 6, and on sunday, in an encouraging sign, it beamed a message to earth. But what it's facing is formidable: though it weathered what space.com called an \" even larger \" dust storm for two weeks in 2007, the atmospheric opacity level then registered around a 5.5. As of sunday, this storm's level was estimated at a much more severe 10.8. On tuesday, nasa's attempt to make contact with the rover failed, suggesting the battery level had finally dipped below 24 volts. That would put it in low power fault mode, where the only subsystem to operate is the mission clock, which is set to wake up the computer at certain intervals to recheck the power level. But opportunity has proven to be plucky: designed for a 90-day mission, it's set to enter year 15 of operation next month. ( in other nasa-related news, its $ 1 billion tower is leaning. )",

Nasa's curiosity rover is keeping tabs on the huge martian dust storm that has sidelined its older cousin on the other side of the planet. That storm, which covered as much area as north america and russia combined as of today ( june 12 ), has engulfed the golf-cart-size opportunity rover, plunging its environs into perpetual darkness. The solar-powered opportunity has therefore temporarily ceased science operations. A recent photo by curiosity suggests that dust may be encroaching a bit on its locale, the 96-mile-wide ( 154 kilometers ) gale crater. But curiosity is nuclear-powered, so a drop in sunlight isn't nearly as concerning to its handlers.

It means there's still enough charge left in the batteries to communicate with home, despite the fact that the storm is continuing to worsen. The blue dot below is where nasa thinks opportunity is located in the storm. The main concern here isn't the dust storm itself. It's the need to keep the rover's heaters operational while maintaining a minimal power level in the batteries. This isn't the first storm that opportunity has weathered, but it is the worst. According to nasa, the weather event the rover faced in 2007 had an opacity level around 5.5. The estimate for this current storm is somewhere around 10.8. Opportunity is a hardy little rover, though, and it has continually defied our expectations over the last 15 years. The rover was only designed to last for a 90-day mission, and yet it's still going.

        "summary": "For years, gun-rights advocates cited a 1997 paper's claim that \" allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes. \" the national research council came out with its own take in 2004, saying there was \" no credible evidence that ' right-to-carry ' laws … either decrease or increase violent crime. \" now researchers from stanford university have confronted the \" vexing task \" of extending that data even further, and come to their own conclusion: that right-to-carry ( or concealed-carry ) laws are actually linked to an increase in violent crimes. The researchers say the strongest evidence concerned aggravated-assault data, which indicates that rtc laws are tied to an 8 % increase in such assaults. Stats also seem to link rtc laws with \" substantially higher rates \" of rape, robbery, and murder. Lead researcher john donohue explains that research used for the 1997 study relied on stats that only went from 1977 to 1992; the nrc extended that data up through the year 2000. Donohue's team took it to 2010, thereby including a decade that saw rtc laws grow in popularity, the huffington post notes ( all 50 states now have a concealed-carry law, according to stanford ). The new research also \" corrected a number of flaws in the data \" by tapping into new statistical methods, according to the director of the johns hopkins center for gun policy and research. Still, donohue admits it's no easy task: \" different statistical models can yield different estimated effects, and our ability to ascertain the best model is imperfect, \" he says in the press release. ( illinois was the last state to approve a concealed-carry law. )",

In 2004, the national research council ( nrc ) offered a critical evaluation of the \"more guns, less crime \" hypothesis using county-level crime data for the period 1977-2000. 15 of the 16 academic members of the nrc panel essentially concluded that the existing research was inadequate to conclude that rtc laws increased or decreased",

Counties from 1977 to 1992, we find that allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths. If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravated assaults would have been avoided yearly. On the other hand, consistent with the notion of criminals responding to incentives, we find criminals substituting into property crimes involving stealth and where the probabilities of contact between the criminal and the victim are minimal.

Picciotto began her anti-nuclear-proliferation vigil on pennsylvania avenue in 1981, and it's believed to be the longest-running protest in american history, reports npr. All these years, picciotto has either staffed the 24-hour vigil herself or made sure others did in her place. Picciotto, who moved to the us from spain in 1960, died on monday at a facility for homeless women within walking distance of her protest site. Recently, she'd been too frail to attend for more than a few hours a day, the washington post reports. She was around 80 years old. Picciotto, who displayed hand-lettered signs with messages like \" live by the bomb, die by the bomb, \" protested alongside two fellow activists in the proposition one group for many years. Protester ellen thomas tells the post that while there were concerns about picciotto's mental health — she believed she was the target of government conspiracies — her dedication to the cause was never in doubt. In 2013, when abc news ' jonathan karl asked her why she had kept up the vigil for so many years, she said, \" because nobody will do it. Nobody will stand up. \" ( that same year, picciotto's vigil was dismantled by us park police, but quickly put back by protesters. )",

The vatican confirmed today that gabriele has been arrested in the enfolding \" vatileaks \" scandal, notes ap. The arrest comes just after the ouster of the president of the vatican bank over standards at the bank. The turmoil appears to be related to the publishing of your holiness: the secret papers of benedict xvi a few days ago, in which an italian journalist uses papers by \" maria, \" a vatican insider, to describe a papacy that is besieged by political games, corruption, and cronyism — allegations that came out earlier this year. Some observers believe too many documents have been leaked to be the work of just one man, and the butler is just the vatican's scapegoat. \"of course there are problems, big problems, \" said one vatican expert. \"what is happening now shows that there's a crisis. \" the bbc has more on the duties of the pope's butler, or valet, here.",

This newly released list covers the nearly 3 million animals among 319 different species that the government killed last year. Most were classified as invasive species in one regard or another, and the usda says they need to be controlled to protect the national food supply. For example, over a million european starlings were poisoned in the name of saving the nation's feedlots, and 30,000 feral swine were killed in part because of the ease with which they can spread disease to livestock. While the government maintains that the practice is a necessary evil, and fewer animals were killed in 2014 than in previous years, opponents have called for reevaluating the cull. At mother jones, tim murphy points out some contradictions: \" the usda killed cats ( 730 ) to save rats, but if you're scoring at home, it also killed 1,327 black rats, 353 norway rats, 74 hutia rats, 7 polynesian rats, 4 bushy-tailed woodrats, and 3 kangaroo rats. \" and a vocativ blogger writes that the killing methods aren't always the most humane, noting that coyotes are killed with \" cruel ankle traps. \"",

The mass cull is part of a department of agriculture effort to crack down on invasive species that threaten crops, property and local wildlife. For instance, the usda kills deer to preserve rare plant species, coyotes to save livestock, and starlings to protect our nation's feedlots. Even though less animals were killed in 2014 than in the previous year, the effort can appear excessive — what did 1,140,309 european starlings ever do to you? — and the department's methods are not always at the cutting edge of humane hunting.

If you are interested in what the donald has to say, you ' ll find it next to our stories on the kardashians and the bachelorette. \" the decision, however, doesn't seem to be going over well: wrong: at the journalism site poynter.org, james warren thinks the move is \" especially dubious in an era where the nexus of entertainment and politics is often quite obvious and growing. \" buffoon or not, trump has clearly \" touched some nerve of dissatisfaction \" among voters. He wonders, too, whether huffpo has heard of other celebs-turned-politicians like ronald reagan and arnold schwarzenegger. And how on earth will it cover the debates? ditto: \" cute but shortsighted, \" writes allahpundit at hot air. \" do they really want to end up stuck running their stories about president trump's inauguration in the sideboob vertical? \" more seriously, the post notes that the \" trump boomlet \" is a \" real, fascinating thing \" worth covering. Hypocritical: \" huffington post is taking the bait, because they're continuing to cover trump and will continue to benefit from the clicks, \" writes dylan byers at politico. In fact, \" one might conclude that huffington post's announcement amounts to the same trump-style grandstanding they claim to condemn. \" but what if...: business insider asked huffpo's ryan grim what the site will do if trump wins. No problem: \" he will not, \" says grim. \" i ' m as likely to get it as he is. \" byers adds that hours after its announcement, huffpo sent out a clarifying email acknowledging trump's impact on the gop and the immigration debate \" is itself a real thing \" and will be covered \" as substance, but anything that tumbles out of his mouth will land on the entertainment page. \"",

        "summary": "Chronic pain can be downright unbearable, and opioids to treat it can be hard to quit. In fact, with opioid addiction claiming more lives than ever, the us is experiencing what president trump has just called a national emergency. Researchers found that in 2015, one in three americans took opioid painkillers — sometimes prescribed by physicians, sometimes not, reports nbc news. And with aging populations in the us and beyond, researchers are now helping governments put a price on pain so that officials can decide how much of a spending priority to make pain management and research into pain management. In short, the new research says that for people who are 50 and older in the us, avoiding chronic pain is worth anywhere from $ 56 to $ 145 a day, reports quartz. Specifically, researchers looked at three things: each respondent's life satisfaction, income, and pain level. To \" heavily oversimplify it, \" as the washington post puts it, the numbers represent either how much extra money a person suffering from chronic pain would need to make every day to enjoy the life satisfaction of someone not in pain, or how much a person not experiencing pain would have to lose to experience the life satisfaction of someone in pain. The range adds up to $ 20,000 to $ 53,000 a year, which almost reaches the country's $ 56,000 median household income. Not surprisingly, wealthier people and those in the most pain are willing to pay more for pain management. ( the opioid epidemic may be considerably worse than previously calculated. )",

        "summary": "The russian investigation seems to have taken a big step forward with the decision by robert mueller to impanel a grand jury, but president trump reiterated a familiar theme to supporters at a west virginia rally thursday night. \" total fabrication, \" he said of the idea his campaign colluded with russians, per nbc news. Trump said he won not because of russians but because of american voters. \" have you seen any russians in west virginia or ohio or pennsylvania? \" he asked. \" are there any russians here tonight? any russians? \" related coverage: protecting mueller: trump couldn't fire mueller directly, reports the washington post, but he could, say, put a new attorney general in place who would be willing and able to do so. To prevent that, two bipartisan pairs of senators — lindsey graham and cory booker, and chris coons and thom tillis — have introduced separate bills to curb the executive branch's ability to fire a special counsel. Both would require federal judges to weigh in. No recess moves: if trump hoped to make any related recess appointments during the senate's august break, he's out of luck. Gop sen. Lisa murkowski made a procedural move to block that, reports the hill. Money trail: it's possible mueller's investigation could result in prosecutions against trump or his associates for reasons that have nothing to do with the election. Instead: financial crimes. Cnn reports that investigators are poring over financial ties between trump associates and russia that could provide \" a more concrete path to potential prosecution. \" the story notes that trump has suggested mueller would be crossing a \" red line \" if he started investigating trump family finances. Subpoenas out: the grand jury already has begun issuing subpoenas, reports the new york times. Details are skimpy, but some involved ousted national security adviser michael flynn, who has been under investigation over his conversations with the russian ambassador and his foreign lobbying. Tipping his hand: the power line blog notes that those subpoenas will likely give trump's legal team a good idea of where the investigation is headed. If the president thinks mueller is indeed crossing red lines unrelated to the original inquiry, he might be more likely to try to fire him. Powerful tool: above the law explains why impaneling the grand jury is such an important step. \" we think of a grand jury merely as a charging tool, but it's also an investigative tool. \" in addition to those subpoenas mentioned earlier, it can also take testimony under oath from witnesses.

            "I am extremely disappointed in the choice of sarah palin as the vice presidential candidate of the republican party. I will still vote for senator mccain, because i am very concerned about having a fundamental leftist, especially one who is a marvelous orator, as president. At first, i thought it amusing that mccain picked a pretty, smart, and tough female to counter the racist/sexist accusations going back and forth between parties. I remember how oprah winfrey got caught in the cross-fire as she stepped up to the political table to support obama with pride that a black man could rise to such heights in the usa, only to get slammed by feminists who told her it was gender, not race, that she should back. Understandably, ms. Winfrey pulled back from it all. Forget gender and race. I ' m frankly and sadly caught in the dilemma of having to balance policy versus example in touting a candidate for the office of the first family. I was ferociously attacked ( what's new? ) when i spoke out strongly against bill clinton's dalliances in the oval office. That situation quickly turned into a debate whether \"private has anything to do with public. \" nonsense. Role models are very important. Children and young adults look to those who are visible and successful as a road map of what is acceptable behavior and emulate those actions over the morals and values their parents and churches have taught and tried to reinforce. It's a tough go these days, when the \"bad that men or women do \" is used for entertainment purposes without judgment, or is excused because of political or financial considerations. I ' m stunned – couldn't the republican party find one competent female with adult children to run for vice president with mccain? i realize his advisors probably didn't want a \"mature \" woman, as the democrats keep harping on his age. But really, what kind of role model is a woman whose fifth child was recently born with a serious issue, down syndrome, and then goes back to the job of governor within days of the birth? i am haunted by the family pictures of the palins during political photo-ops, showing the eldest daughter, now pregnant with her own child, cuddling the family's newborn. When mom and dad both work full-time ( no matter how many folks get involved with the children ), it becomes a somewhat chaotic situation. Certainly, if",

The wall street journal earlier this year described it as the only known one from the period in galilee; the bible describes jesus as \" teaching in [ galilee's ] synagogues, preaching the good news. \" in terms of its location, migdal was named for the ancient town of magdala, where mary magdalene is believed to have hailed from, and the dig revealed the site in question \" was not just near magdala; this was magdala, \" as the journal puts it. In haaretz's telling, experts say it's probable that jesus preached there. Dina gorni, one of the archaeologists who worked on the dig, was a bit more cautious in a 2012 interview with the global mail. Gorni notes the synagogue was likely built to hold 120, though thousands lived in magdala. \" we believe, we suggest, that this was a special community, not large, that put itself at the edge of the main jewish village, \" said gorni. \" they may be connected to jesus and mary magdalene. We know that jesus was not involved in the main jewish community and preferred to live aside. Perhaps he was the leader around whom this synagogue was built. \" ( a new book claims jesus had two children. )",

The washington post reports that some gop senators may be unwilling to support tillerson because of his ties to russia — which could make nomination tricky, since he ' ll need at least 50 votes in the senate, and the republicans have a total of 52. Cnbc reports that john mccain and marco rubio have both expressed major doubts about tillerson, with rubio tweeting that \" being a ' friend of vladimir ' is not an attribute i am hoping for. \" tillerson does, however, have the endorsement of former secretaries of state james baker and condoleezza rice. A roundup of coverage: a brief statement from trump's transition office praised tillerson as being among \" the most accomplished business leaders and international dealmakers in the world, \" adding that he would be a \" forceful and clear-eyed advocate for america's vital national interests. \" see the los angeles times. Tillerson will face more roadblocks than russia on his way to the nomination, politico reports in a look at the five biggest obstacles, including oil deals in canada and iraq. The ap notes that tillerson's exxonmobil position has given him experience in dozens of countries, but as a businessman, not a diplomat. He had almost $ 150 million in unvested stock options at the end of 2015, and analysts say that if he becomes secretary of state, he will have to either get rid of his exxon holdings or recuse himself from a large part of his duties. The guardian looks at the looming nomination battle in congress and notes that it will revolve around two issues likely to overshadow the start of trump's presidency: russia, and conflicts of interest. The wall street journal examines the international reactions to the apparent choice of tillerson. It was praised by the kremlin and by analysts in china and japan, while baltic countries including latvia were worried by his closeness to moscow. Reuters reports that trump called mitt romney to tell him he had offered the job to somebody else. \" it was an honor to have been considered for secretary of state of our great country, \" romney said in a facebook post monday night, adding that his discussions with trump had been \" enjoyable and enlightening. \"",

That timeline has now been pushed to thursday, with turchinov saying more time was needed to ensure a \" coalition of national faith \" was installed — a statement made alongside another warning of the \" serious threat \" of separatism, reports the bbc. Pro-russia regions have seen protests against yanukovich's removal, and in crimea's sevastopol ( where russia operates a sizable naval base ), protesters yesterday yelled \" russia! russia! \" outside city hall, and swapped a ukrainian flag for russia's. More: but speaking of sevastopol, officials there say they have no clue where yanukovich is, though a local tv station claimed he was holed up in the naval base and intended to sail for russia. In the guardian's telling, there are few facts regarding his whereabouts, but plenty of rumors. Interim interior minister arsen avakov says yanukovich was seen leaving a home in balaklava around midnight on sunday with a few bodyguards who remained loyal to him. ( a girlfriend may have gone along, too, notes the new york times. ) avakov seems to be leading the hunt for yanukovich, and issued a plea on facebook that citizens and border guards stop any attempts yanukovich might make to leave. The times reports that he is believed to have severed \" all forms of communication, \" and has been fleeing by car and helicopter. By last night, the stories were coming fast and furious: he was in sevastopol, or still in balaklava, or on his yacht, or hiding in a monastery near donetsk. Who did yanukovich have contact with in the us before vanishing? joe biden. The ap reports that biden \" was at the forefront of the delicate diplomatic maneuvering \" on behalf of the white house, and spoke to yanukovich by phone nine times during the three-month crisis, which the ap terms \" an unusual level of contact. \" biden last spoke with him two days before he fled kiev, and hung up uncertain as to yanukovich's next move.

        "summary": "Newsweek has found itself at the center of controversy again, this time with a cover story titled \" hit the road, barack, \" in which economist ( and mccain 2008 adviser ) niall ferguson picks apart the obama presidency. Ferguson accuses the president of breaking campaign promises, boosting the deficit, letting the us fall behind economically, abandoning afghanistan, and much more. Voters, he writes, \" can let barack obama's rambling, solipsistic narrative continue until they find themselves living in some american version of europe … or they can opt for real change. \" but voices have been coming out of the woodwork to lambaste ferguson for factual errors. A taste: paul krugman fired the opening shot, noting that ferguson, in trying to prove that obamacare would bust the deficit, wrote that the cbo had estimated that the \" insurance-coverage provision \" would cost around $ 1.2 trillion. But anyone who even skimmed the cbo report would know this is a distortion; the full law reduced the deficit. \" i guess they don't do fact-checking \" at newsweek, he writes. \" the times would require an abject correction if something like that slipped through. \" ferguson called that a \" truly feeble objection, \" saying that what he'd written had been technically true — but business insider calls that defense \" embarrassing \" and politico calls it \" ridiculous. \" \" niall ferguson's defense is that he was being very obtuse and misleading, \" scoffs joe weisenthall. Matthew yglesias at slate points out that one of ferguson's charts is absurd; ferguson appears to be blaming obama for chinese growth. Blogger noah smith points out many more distortions — like ferguson blaming obama for not fulfilling his promise to \" build the roads, and bridges, and electric grids, \" while praising paul ryan, who is calling for drastic infrastructure cuts. The atlantic runs a full fact-check, and finds loads more distortions. Ferguson, for instance, blames obama for job losses that took place in 2008, before he took office, among many others. Newsweek has confirmed krugman's suspicion that it does not fact-check. \" we, like other news organizations today, rely on our writers to submit factually accurate material, \" a spokesman told politico.",

        "summary": "After a short respite, athletic shoes containing human feet are once again washing up on canadian shores, the guardian reports. Earlier this month, a family visiting a vancouver island beach made a \" grisly discovery, \" according to the cbc. \" we had a look at it for about five minutes and we thought, ' it almost looks like there is an actual foot bone in it, ' \" says charlotte stephens, whose husband spotted the shoe and brought it onto the beach. It was the first foot sighting in british columbia in four years. Five days later, another foot in a shoe was found — a match for the first, making the latest two finds a pair. They were the 11th and 12th feet to wash ashore in british columbia since 2007. Four more have also washed up in washington state to the south, with the most recent being found in 2014 in seattle. Since the feet started appearing in 2007, people have suspected everything from drug dealers to serial killers, the washington post reports. The truth is likely much more mundane. Barb mclintock at a coroner's office in british columbia tells the guardian the feet almost assuredly come from people who either killed themselves ( \" people jump off bridges, \" a criminologist told the daily beast in 2011 ) or were killed by storms. A study once found that when a body is being pushed and pulled around in water, hands and feet are usually first to fall off. Coroners can tell whether bones separated naturally during decomposition or by force, and so far the feet show no signs of foul play. Tide patterns and new shoe designs with air pockets and lighter foam that allow them to float account for why the feet suddenly started appearing in 2007 in the pacific northwest. But one mystery still remains: most of the shoes contain right feet.",

The wbo says it \" received no response from him or his legal representatives on this matter. \" a rep for mayweather has called the decision \" a complete disgrace … floyd will decide what, or if any, actions he will take. But in the meantime he's enjoying a couple of hundred million he made from his last outing and this has zero impact on anything he does. \" interestingly, just hours after his fight with pacquiao, mayweather told a press conference he'd consider giving up his belts. \" i ' m not greedy. The other guys need a chance. It is time they fight for the belts, \" he said. Cnn reports mayweather has two weeks to appeal. If the decision stands, the welterweight title will go to timothy bradley after an interim title bout win last month.",

After that passed, lawmakers could immediately begin work on a more comprehensive reform package, perhaps one that would create a pathway to citizenship for the nation's millions of undocumented immigrants, reports the new york times. \"if you want to take it that further step, i ' ll take the heat, \" said trump, aware that such a move likely wouldn't sit well with his support base. \"you are not that far away from comprehensive immigration reform. \" the meeting came as republicans and democrats continue to try to hash out a budget agreement ahead of a jan. 19 deadline, with immigration the main sticking point.

        "summary": "In 2010, players had a big complaint about the world cup: the ball didn't move right. The adidas jabulani was engineered as a theoretical improvement over your standard, 32-panel ball. With just eight panels, it had fewer stitches, and that, supposedly, meant a less-turbulent flight through the air, brian palmer explains in the washington post. But in reality, stitches actually create fairly even turbulence all over the ball, and it flies they way players expect. This year's ball, the adidas brazuca, has even fewer panels — just six.

Syed is seeking a new trial based on a number of legal theories. One of them is that his lawyer failed to present the testimony of asia mcclain, a potential alibi witness who claims to have seen syed at the time he allegedly committed the murder.

The maryland court of special appeals told a lower court to consider hearing sworn testimony from asia mcclain, a high school classmate who has said she saw syed at a public library at the time prosecutors believe he killed his ex-girlfriend. Mcclain's testimony is to be used by the judges as they consider whether he deserves a new trial. \" this is what we wanted from the beginning, \" said c. Justin brown, syed's attorney. \" it's the right thing to do. It's in the interest of justice that asia mcclain be allowed to testify in court. \" once-closed legal doors keep opening for syed since \" serial \" was released last year.

Salahi's not the only one with his nose out of joint, notes tmz ( which appears to be treating the tragic breakup something like that royal wedding thing ): neal schon's wife of two entire months is also understandably upset. \" this is very painful for me. I ' m very hurt, \" says 1986 playboy playmate ava fabian. But if schon comes crawling back? \" no. \" tareq salahi is also burning bridges: he filed for divorce friday. The salahis ' assets from their defunct winery were also set for the auction block today. All in all, a week for the ages.",

The video, which the telegraph notes was originally shot in munich in july 2016, seems to show now-64-year-old king maha vajiralongkorn walking with a woman, wearing a yellow crop top and flaunting his ample body tats. Somsak jeamteerasakul, a thai historian and critic now living in france, posted the video to his own facebook page in april, and in early may he says he received a letter from \" tim \" at facebook, letting him know the company had received a thai criminal court order telling him the video violated the nation's computer crimes act. Part of the problem: jeamteerasakul's post ( which he posted alongside pics of justin bieber in a crop top ) and others like it could be violations of thailand's lese-majeste laws, which make it illegal to insult or threaten the royal family. Another issue: the military junta, which took over in 2014, seems determined to dump facebook altogether. Techcrunch notes that even though facebook still appears operational in thailand — the government had threatened to shut it down tuesday if facebook didn't disable 131 \" illicit \" posts so thai users couldn't see them — it temporarily blocked the network once before in 2014, and there've been whispers of plans to institute a \" single national internet gateway. \" a facebook rep tells the times it tries to comply with government requests to restrict access when content may flout local laws.

Also this month, the domestic news media quoted the thai internet service provider association as saying that it would be forced to shut down facebook by tuesday morning if the company had not removed all 131 pages.
