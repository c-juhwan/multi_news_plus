The un-endorsed inspectors have only nine months to get rid of the entire arsenal â€” the tightest deadlines the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons has ever faced, the ap reports. And it has to do the whole thing in the middle of a civil war, to boot. The 20-person advance team has been in the country for five days, but today was when the disarmament began in earnest. The group says it oversaw local workers as they used cutting torches, angle grinders, and disc saws to dismantle items like missile warheads and aerial bombs, and disable mixing and filling equipment. \" let it be clear that it is the syrians who do the actual destroying while we monitor, observe, verify, and report, \" an official from the mission tells reuters. The team will grow to 100 inspectors in the future.",

Downey tops our list of hollywood's highest-paid actors with an estimated $ 75 million in earnings between june 2012 and june 2013.

Directors like robert altman and oliver stone gave him work but for the most part, his career seemed to be a lost cause. Downey turned that around with iron man. The first film in the franchise earned $ 585 million at the global box office. Overall the franchise has brought in $ 2.4 billion. And then there's the avengers.

Residents of rural bobtown, pennsylvania, were rocked by a fracking blast last week that sparked a five-day fire and apparently killed one rig worker, gizmodo reports. But just days later, chevron â€” which owns the fracking site â€” sent about 100 gift certificates to locals offering each one a free large pizza and a 2-liter soda, the philadelphia daily news reports. \" we are sorry to have missed you, \" reads an accompanying letter that promises to \" achieve incident-free operations. \" the tuesday blast was something else, reports the pittsburgh post-gazette. First a fire started at the marcellus shale gas well, then the heat caused a tanker-truck explosion that \" sounded like a jet engine going 5 feet above your house, \" said a neighbor. The blaze was so ferocious that firefighters had to fall back and police put up a half-mile perimeter around the site. The wells are still leaking natural gas into the air, gawker reports, and a public-health assessment has found that the state's 6-year fracking boom is causing a wave of illness in southwest pennsylvania.",

Then suddenly, an explosion launched the 60-year-old woman onto a rock jetty 10 feet away, breaking two of her ribs and knocking her unconscious for three minutes, reports wtnh and cbs news. \" she was like a human cannon, \" her sister says. A bomb squad searched the beach â€” which danise has frequented for 30 years â€” for explosives or evidence of a malicious attack, but nothing turned up, reports abc 6. Officials, who say they're stumped, are \" leaving no stone unturned \" as they investigate whether cables buried in the sand, supposedly disabled in 2007, might be to blame, reports abc news. The beach remains at least partially open. Two abandoned coast guard cables were dug up from the sand yesterday, though it isn't clear if they had anything to do with the explosion. Some witnesses reportedly smelled gas after the accident, but a rep for national grid says the nearest gas line is 200 yards from where danise was injured. One cable found beneath the beach, which national grid says isn't theirs, shows no signs of charring, debris, or explosive residue, reports cbs news. An official says simply \" there was some type of noise and some type of energy transfer. \" some are suggesting a seismic event or a methane explosion, perhaps triggered by organic matter like seaweed beneath the sand. Meanwhile, danise, who also suffered a concussion and internal bleeding, is out of the hospital with plans to \" get better as soon as possible and get back to work. \" she won't, however, return to salty brine state beach.

The video ( an untranslated version appears on youtube ) was recently posted to militant websites and was covered by cnn yesterday. What us officials would say: the video does seem to be recent and authentic, and it's being carefully reviewed. What they won't say: if they knew the meeting â€” which al-qaeda's no. 2 attended â€” was taking place, or if the video is what tipped them off. That honcho, al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula leader nasser al-wuhayshi, shows his face in the video and \" looks unconcerned \" about the possibility of a us drone hitting the meeting, notes cnn. He urges attacks against america. \" we must eliminate the cross, \" he said, and \" the bearer of the cross is america. \" other faces, however, were digitally obscured; the post suggests this may because those faces belong to western recruits. It further sees wuhayshi's prominence in the video as a move that could be designed to expand his following and cement his position as ayman al-zawahiri's successor. ( reports say wuhayshi was groomed by osama bin laden himself. )",

The us dollar dropped sharply after trump's comments, reports bloomberg, which notes that other presidents have avoided commenting on the greenback's value to avoid causing major market movements. In the journal interview, trump also reversed his campaign policy on the federal export-import bank, which insures foreign purchases of us goods, saying he now supports the institution because it helps small companies. During his campaign he said it was unnecessary. In a third policy shift, trump signaled that he might appoint fed chair janet yellen to another four-year term, \" i do like a low-interest rate policy, \" he said.

        "summary": "A new startup is willing to spot you up to $ 50,000 for a down payment on a house â€” provided you're cool with a string of strangers coming into your new home for the first few years. King 5 reports loftium launched monday in seattle. It was started by 29-year-old yifan zhang after she realized she could cover the mortgage on her new townhouse by renting out the spare bedroom on airbnb, according to the new york times. Here's how it works: loftium uses an algorithm to figure out how much value your spare room has and determine the amount of money it will give you for a down payment. In return, new homeowners agree to continuously list an extra bedroom on airbnb for one to three years, sending about two-thirds of that rental income back to loftium. \" it's for the people who don't have the parents to help or the high income to save while paying rent, \" zhang says. Laura coe, 29, is closing on a home in seattle on friday with the help of $ 9,000 from loftium â€” money it would have taken her time to save. \" it allowed me to get in now, \" coe tells king. \" i would have had to wait. \" in its first week, loftium had 50 home-buyers lined up, the stranger reports. There are, of course, some drawbacks to the deal. Zhang has already hosted about 200 airbnb guests in her home since last year. And loftium customers are only given eight \" freebie \" days per year they don't have to list their spare room for rent. There's also the realistic possibility of cities like seattle cracking down on airbnb rentals. Loftium is currently only available in seattle but may expand to a number of other cities, including denver and chicago, in the coming year.",

When she bought a townhouse in seattle with her husband last summer, she knew that the spare bedroom could generate extra income on airbnb. But when she learned just how much they could collect each month â€” enough to cover the mortgage, and sometimes more â€” her entrepreneurial instincts kicked in: why not front would-be home buyers money for a down payment, and then collect a share of their airbnb rental income in return? that was how loftium, a service in seattle, came about: it will provide prospective home buyers with up to $ 50,000 for a down payment, as long as they are",

        "summary": "Over about 10 weeks in 1888, jack the ripper is said to have killed five women, the last of which was mary jane kelly. But as the new historian reports, some doubt was cast on the latter fact in 2015 with the publication of a book asserting that mary jane kelly was a pseudonym for an east end prostitute. Her true identity? elizabeth weston davies, great aunt of the book's author, wynne weston-davies. A telegraph article explains what could be so explosive about that if true: weston-davies believes jack the ripper was in fact francis spurzheim craig, a police-court reporter married to elizabeth who became enraged when she once again started prostituting herself after their marriage and killed the other women as \" cover \" before murdering her. The claim piqued the interest of crime writer patricia cornwell, who turned to the experts in an attempt to solve the mystery. The upshot of a report out of the university of leicester: the mystery will likely go unsolved. The scientists cornwell engaged included those who helped identify king richard iii, and their task this time was to determine whether they could find the precise location of kelly's remains in a leytonstone cemetery and perform dna analysis on them. The problem is that in 1947, the communal gravesite she was buried in was \" reclaimed... With earlier grave positions being swept away to make way for new burials, \" says mathew morris. His team calculated that the area that would need to be excavated could involve disturbing hundreds of graves ( which under english law would require their relative's consent ). \" accurate identification of any of her remains highly problematic if not impossible, \" says dr. Turi king, who thinks no exhumation license would be granted under the circumstances. ( here's another theory on jack the ripper's true identity. )",

        "summary": "President donald trump offered a simple defense thursday to accusations he broke campaign finance law by directing attorney michael cohen to orchestrate hush-money payments to conceal trump's alleged affairs: he was following terrible advice from a bad lawyer. \" i never directed michael cohen to break the law. He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law. It is called ' advice of counsel, ' \" trump wrote on twitter. The advice-of-counsel defense is a real thing, the ap reports. But trump's ability to use it, if he were ever formally accused of a crime, is far from certain. And it could be risky. \" people talk about advice-of-counsel as a defense more than it's actually asserted, and it's rarely successful, \" said dane ciolino, a constitutional law professor at loyola university in new orleans. Courts have held that the defense applies when a person has gone to a lawyer to ask about whether something is legal, disclosed all material facts, and then relied in good faith on the professional's advice that no laws were being broken. The illegal act in this case involves payments made to porn star stormy daniels and playboy centerfold karen mcdougal to keep them from talking about sexual encounters they say they had with trump while he was married. Federal prosecutors in new york say the payments amounted to illegal campaign contributions because they were made at the height of the 2016 election season to keep voters from learning of trump's alleged infidelities. Cohen, who has said trump was aware of the payments, was sentenced wednesday to three years in prison for the violations and other crimes, including bank fraud and tax evasion. ( trump had more to say on cohen in a fox news interview thursday. More on that here, or read more on the risks of the advice-of-counsel defense here. )",

Brooke's story had drawn national attention over the years â€” like this profile by nbc news â€” and a previous story in discovery news reported that scientists were studying her genes to see whether they might shed light on the aging process. It's not clear what caused the syndrome, but brooke had a series of life-threatening health scares in her first few years, including a stroke. She recovered, but soon stopped developing. Her mother once described her daughter's condition this way: \" have you ever seen the movie groundhog day? that's brooke. Every day is the same thing with her.

        "summary": "Could the fight that put muhammad ali on the map have been a sham? the fbi had reason to believe that 22-year-old ali's first bout against heavyweight champ sonny liston was rigged, and that the mob may have been involved, according to decades-old documents obtained by the washington times under the freedom of information act. The fight, which occurred 50 years ago today, is regarded as a classic. Ali, then known as cassius clay, came in as an 8-1 underdog, according to sports illustrated's retelling, but he emerged as the youngest heavyweight champion ever, after liston failed to answer the bell in the seventh round, complaining of a hurt shoulder. But in memos to j. Edgar hoover, fbi agents said a houston gambler had told them that vegas gambler ash resnick had introduced him to liston, and that on the day of the fight resnick warned him not to bet on it, saying he'd know why when he saw the fight on tv. Resnick was allegedly friends with meyer lansky, among other notorious mob figures. Liston was said to have ties to lucchese family figures, and rumors have long swirled that his mysterious death years later was a mob hit. The fbi was never able to prove anything, and a florida post-fight investigation ruled the win legitimate. But in a 1998 book on ali, one of liston's corner men said the shoulder injury \" was all bs, \" and that liston had simply quit. Two things the times points out: the documents at no time indicate ali was party to the alleged scheme, and nothing in them \" suggests the bureau ever fully corroborated the suspicions. \"",

        "summary": "Video footage of a chicago police officer fatally shooting a 17-year-old black teen has just been released â€” three years after the actual event. As recently as dec. 23, city attorneys were fighting to keep the jan. 7, 2013, footage from being made public, but the city on wednesday reversed course. Released thursday, three soundless videos â€” taken from cameras mounted at an intersection, school, and business â€” show an unmarked police car pull up beside a silver dodge charger, which police say cedrick chatman had just stolen, per the chicago sun-times. Officers kevin fry and lou toth jump out with their guns drawn. Chatman runs from the charger and fry and toth take off after him, with toth in the lead. As chatman rounds a corner, fry is seen raising his gun in his direction. Chatman crumples and toth quickly puts him in handcuffs. Chatman was hit with two of fry's four shots, which were fired about 7 seconds after chatman exited the charger, reports usa today. He died later at a hospital. Fry told investigators he opened fire when he saw chatman turn slightly toward toth holding a black object, which fry feared was a gun. It was actually a black iphone box, reports fox 32. State's attorney anita alvarez and the independent police review authority both absolved the officers of wrongdoing, though an ipra investigator says he was fired for refusing to clear fry. \" they say chatman turned or made a little movement, but you can't see that on the video and i doubt it happened, \" he says. \" if it did happen, it was still clear chatman was just trying to get away. \" the footage will now be included as evidence in a wrongful-death suit filed by chatman's family.",

The newly leaked documents are labeled \" secret \" and \" noforn, \" meaning no sharing with foreign governments, both of which are lower clearance levels than the \" top secret \" docs snowden accessed, reports cnn. One government accountability office study has found that more than 3.2 million people were approved in recent years to access \" secret \" and higher clearance docs. Said greenwald himself last month: \" i have no doubt there will be other sources inside the government who see extreme wrongdoing who are inspired by edward snowden. \" the intercept's main takeaway is that the terrorist identities datamart environment ( tide ) has grown to more than a million names, nearly double its level when the underwear bomber tried to blow up a plane on christmas 2009. Other revelations include, as per the new york times: 3,258 people are \" known or suspected terrorists \" in the war in syria, including 41 americans; 50,466 people are linked to al-qaeda; 62,794 to the taliban; 21,199 to hezbollah; 21,913 to hamas; and 280,000 names on the list have no listed affiliation with a terrorist group.

When people today hear about the experiment, they usually reject the idea that they'd be susceptible to carrying out cruel acts simply because they were told to, saying, \" i would never behave in such a manner, \" tomasz grzyb tells the independent. But grzyb, co-author of a recent study in the social psychological and personality science journal, says the new experiment re-created the milgram project, in poland this time, and that nothing much has changed over the past 50 years: the obedience level was still high for modern-day subjects asked to carry out similarly shocking actions. For the recent trial, which couldn't exactly duplicate the original due to ethical concerns, 40 men and 40 women between the ages of 18 and 69 were placed before 10 buttons with increasing shock levels â€” and 90 % of the subjects went all the way up to the highest level when asked, a press release notes. If participants believed a woman was receiving the shocks, they were less willing to go all the way, but the researchers say the sample size was too small to draw real conclusions from that. The scientists chose poland as their locale because milgram-style tests had never been carried out in central europe, where the authors found the question of rigid obedience to authority to be \" exceptionally interesting, \" they write. More than 50 years later, \" a striking majority of subjects are still willing to electrocute a helpless individual, \" grzyb says in the release.

North korea intends to close the punggye-ri facility beneath mount mantap between wednesday and friday, depending on the weather, and journalists from five outside countries have been invited to attend and observe.

Setting expectations: \" expect good imagery, but not much else, \" quips the ap, which expects a scene \" heavy on spectacle and light on substance. \" motivation: the ap notes that in revealing in april that the facility would be closed, kim jong un said his reasoning was that north korea has completed its nuclear development and doesn't need to conduct future tests there. A physicist with the union of concerned scientists is skeptical: \" north korea certainly would need more tests to have any confidence in its h-bomb. \" a study released in april suggested much of the facility is actually useless due to collapses, though 38 north countered that by asserting there are two portals \" located in more pristine competent rock \" that it believes would be appropriate for testing.",

Which has left senior bryce maine in a bit of a spot since he'd asked his grandmother, catherine maine, to be his date to the special event because she'd never gone to her own. The school is now denying \" nanny's \" invitation; its reasoning, per a statement: prom guests are to be all around the same age for safety reasons, with the school saying it's turned down requests to bring older dates before. Another reason, according to a facebook post by \" sarah catherine, \" who says she's bryce's cousin: the school board is afraid if they let bryce bring nanny in all seriousness, others will want to do it as a joke at future proms. \" my blood is boiling right now, \" sarah writes, explaining that their grandmother already bought a dress for the april 8 dance. \" like really?! \" fellow students at bryce's school are also pushing the #letnannygotoprom hashtag on social media, fox news reports. One twitter user notes what others are thinking: \" of course the rules exist for good reasons, but common sense exists to tell them when exceptions should be made. \" the school, meanwhile, says in its statement that no parent or guardian has officially complained about the age limit yet, and that the father of the student in \" the situation that has come to light on social media \" ( ostensibly bryce's situation ) has been called to see if he can meet with school officials. So far, no meeting will be happening until at least monday. ( an indiana teen took his 93-year-old greatÂ­-grandmother to the prom. )",

            "Ovarian cysts are considered large if they have diameters between 5 and 15cm [ 3,8 ] or between 10 and 20cm [ 9 ]; and those with diameters over the respective upper limits are called giant cysts. The largest cystic tumor of the ovary weighed 137.4kg and was removed intact by o ' hanlan in 1994 [ 6 ]. Another giant ( 64kg ) mucinous tumor with foci of a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma was described by poole et al. In a morbidly obese woman [ 7 ]. In young people, the majority of ovarian cysts decrease in size or even disappear and therefore should be dealt with with a careful expectant follow-up by ultrasonography. Benign cysts of less than 8cm are conservatively managed, but cystectomy is indicated for cysts over 5cm in post-menopausal women. Giant cysts require resection because of compressive symptoms or risk of malignancy and their management invariably requires laparotomy to prevent perforation and spillage of the cyst fluid into the cavity [ 8 ]. Clinically, the differential diagnosis of large abdominal masses should include: uterine enlargement ( pregnancy, fibromyomatosis ); pelvic endometriosis; ( pregnancy, abdominal cysts ); abdominal pregnancy; urinary retention ( full bladder ); intestinal tumors; hydronephrotic kidney; pelvic retroperitoneal tumors; accentuated obesity; ascitis; cyst of the urachus; mesenteric cyst; abdominal cocoon [ 10 ]; and echinococcosis [ 11 ]"

Per the guardian, scientists have created an artificial ovary out of human tissue and eggs, and that ovary's performance on tests is encouraging. Susanne pors, a co-author of the study, tells cnn the ovary was made by creating a bare-bones \" scaffold \" out of donated ovarian tissue stripped of all of its cells ( including cancerous ones ); hundreds of tiny human egg sacs, or follicles, were implanted onto the scaffold. That ovary was then implanted into a mouse, and about 25 % of the follicles endured for at least three weeks, while nourishing blood vessels grew around the ovary. Pors and her team will reveal more on the research monday at the annual meeting of the european society of human reproduction and embryology in barcelona, spain. Up to this point, cancer patients have been able to freeze their eggs before treatment â€” though that can affect the cells ' viability, per the independent â€” or a patient's ovarian tissue can be removed before cancer treatment, frozen, then reintroduced into her body after treatment is over. The problem, however, is that cancerous cells may still linger in the tissue, which means it puts the patient at risk of seeing her cancer return. Egg follicles, however, have a membrane that doesn't allow cancer to get in, pors notes. Such an artificial ovary also has the potential to be a boon for women who've gone through early menopause or who have other diseases that wreak havoc on fertility. Pors tells the guardian that although this news is promising, it could still be up to another 10 years before human trials are held. ( the us fertility rate recently hit a record low. )",

        "summary": "The rusty patched bumblebee has gone from a widespread and well-known pollinator to the edge of extinction in just 20 years. Reuters reports that the species, which got its name from the reddish patch on its abdomen, has been proposed for the endangered species list by the us fish and wildlife service. It would be the first of the us and canada's 47 bumblebee species on the list. The bee's population has dropped by close to 90 % since the late 1990s because of factors including disease and habitat loss, according to fish and wildlife, which describes this species and other bumblebees as pollinators that \" contribute to our food security and the healthy functioning of our ecosystems. \" rusty patched bumblebees were once found in at least 26 eastern states, but they're only seen in a handful of states today, according to the xerces society for invertebrate conservation, which asked the government to safeguard the species. The los angeles times notes that the bee's decline is bad news for anybody who eats food: it has a longer life span than most bumblebees and is better than most at pollinating crops, including cranberries, plums, alfalfa, and apples.

Named for the conspicuous reddish blotch on its abdomen, the rusty patched bumble bee â€” or bombus affinis, as it is known to scientists â€” has plunged in abundance and distribution by more than 90 percent since the late 1990s, according to the fish and wildlife service. The agency attributes the decline to a number of factors, including disease, pesticides, climate change and habitat loss. Bumble bees, as distinguished from domesticated honey bees, are essential pollinators of wildflowers and about a third of u.s. Crops, from blueberries to tomatoes, said sarina jepsen of the xerces society for invertebrate conservation, which petitioned the government for protection of the insect.

Population declines among wild bees are much more difficult to document than those in honey bees, which are for the most part managed commercially and whose numbers are carefully tracked by beekeepers, jespen said. Jepsen said protections proposed for the rusty patched bumble bee will intensify the debate over the degree to which so-called neonicotinoid pesticides, routinely used in agriculture and applied to plants and trees in gardens and parks, have contributed to the decline of native bees. \"endangered species act safeguards are now the only way the bumble bee would have a fighting chance for survival, \" she added.

Us district judge david o. Carter said he was \" deeply concerned \" by the gaunt condition of 24-year-old muhanad badawi, who is awaiting trial on charges of assisting isis by buying a plane ticket for a fellow supporter, the orange county register reports. The judge said that badawi â€” who ripped out an iv while hospitalized over the weekend â€” will be given the chance to voluntarily accept food before every force-feeding. At a hearing last thursday, carter asked badawi what his favorite foods were, then sent somebody to the store to buy the honey, peanut butter, tuna, bread, and bananas the suspect said he liked, abc7 reports. At that hearing, badawi said he wasn't on a hunger strike, but that he wanted to fast on mondays and thursdays for religious reasons. \" you've got the wrong days and the wrong time, \" carter told him, per the register. \" this is not friday and this is not ramadan. \" badawi's lawyer said at monday's hearing that her client's mental state has been going downhill after recent terror attacks, which have caused him to believe he has no chance of getting a fair trial, the register reports.",

Peter petrasek escaped czechoslovakia during world war ii and met and married his wife joan, an irish immigrant, in canada. The pair made seattle their home in the late 1950s. Joan died in 1998 at 79, and when peter passed away in 2012 at 85, their identical wills made clear that they had left their entire fortune to \" the government of the united states of america. \" while it isn't clear why the couple chose such a beneficiary, the us assistant attorney who worked with the treasury department to accept the funds last week suspects it was a \" thank you \" to the country that gave them a fresh start at life. \" it's pretty obvious these folks felt pretty proud they were us citizens, \" he tells abc news. Peter petrasek was only 12 when nazis invaded czechoslovakia. \" from what he told me, all their property was confiscated, \" the couple's neighbor tells the seattle times. \" the germans hauled off his father to a camp. \" his mother was left behind in prague, his sister died in allied bombing in dresden, and petrasek was put in a youth camp linked to the german air force. He and his wife had no children or living relatives when they died, and it took some time for their 1977 ford granada, a gun collection, and artwork to be sold. Then officials had to work out where the money would go. They decided on the treasury's general fund. Though it took a lifetime to acquire, the $ 847,215 donation would have covered just 7.63 seconds of us government spending last year, based on a $ 3.5 trillion budget, the times reports.

But then that might have had to do with my own insecurities in playing him as well. \" brosnan doesn't, however, seem to regret the job: playing bond was like being \" an ambassador to a small nation, \" he says. \" it's the gift that keeps on giving, that allowed me to create my own production company and make my own movies. \" in a separate interview with cigar aficionado cited by page six, brosnan notes, \" i was lucky enough to make four bond films. It finished [ with 2002's die another day ] in rather shambolic fashion, but i have no bitterness, no resentment. I hold bond dear to my heart. \"",

Johnson â€” whose bid for clemency was rejected just days before the end of barack obama's presidency â€” was sentenced to life in 1996 for passing messages between drug dealers. Kardashian contacted johnson in an alabama federal prison and paid for a new legal team after hearing about her plight on social media last year, page six reports. Jared kushner has also taken an interest in the johnson case. It's not clear whether trump will grant her clemency, though both sides hailed wednesday's meeting as a success. Trump tweeted that he had discussed prison reform and sentencing with kardashian in a \" great meeting, \" while kardashian thanked trump for his time â€” and wished johnson a happy birthday. \" we are optimistic about ms. Johnson's future and hopeful that she â€” and so many like her â€” will get a second chance at life, \" kardashian tweeted.

Benjamin glaze of oklahoma, now 20, was 19 when he auditioned for idol last october and revealed to judges before starting in on his song that he had never been kissed: \" i've never been in a relationship. I can't kiss a girl without being in a relationship. \" perry told him to come over to the judges'table, where a hesitant glaze said, \" one on the cheek? \" before kissing perry on the cheek. She convinced him to try again, but as he went for her cheek, she turned and pecked him on the lips, causing him to fall to the ground still holding his guitar while shouting, \" katy! you didn't! \" before starting his song, he asked for water, noting, \" it's just that i, i kinda wasn't expecting that. \" he made it little more than 30 seconds into his audition song before perry stopped him; she and fellow judges luke bryan and lionel ritchie ultimately rejected him. While rendering her verdict ( video of the entire incident here ), perry acknowledged his shaky performance was \" a bit rushed, and maybe that was because i sped up your bpm of the heartbeat. \" she and richie urged him to practice more and \" kiss a couple more girls \" before auditioning again. After the audition aired during sunday night's season premiere, some started calling perry out; on twitter, mike cernovich referred to her behavior as \" predatory. \" the new york times reached out to glaze, who acknowledged he was \" a tad bit uncomfortable \" and that he wanted to \" save \" his first kiss for his first relationship: \" i wanted it to be special. \" but, he says, he doesn't think it was sexual harassment, and he's grateful for the extra attention being brought to his music ( perry even tweeted about him ).

Hathaway and scott j. Shapiro in the new york times. There is no direct threat to any nato member, so reprehensible as it may seem, we must wait for approval. Remember, before the un and its rules, there \" was almost constant war. \" in the washington post, matt miller brings up six \" qualms \" he has about the situation. The first: \" what about the first 100,000 people assad killed over two and a half years? what message are we sending to tyrants about the world's willingness to look away from regular old mass murder within their own borders?... Our whole approach still feels uncomfortably close to saying ' we'd really prefer you stick with the machine guns, if you don't mind. ' \" striking syria is not a good idea for president obama, writes robert reich at salon. And it's also not critical for the middle east's future: \" in fact, a strike on syria may well cause more havoc in that tinder-box region of the world by unleashing still more hatred for america, the west, and for israel, and more recruits to terrorism, \" he writes. And then there's the fact that, \" once we take military action, any subsequent failure to follow up or prevent gains by the other side is seen as an even larger sign of our weakness, further emboldening our enemies. \" and, despite the fact that obama clearly said the use of chemical weapons was a \" red line, \" the president has the right to change his mind, writes charlie cook in the national journal. Obama's decision to seek congressional approval before making a move suggests he \" was following the admonition of shakespeare's falstaff in henry iv that discretion is the better part of valor, \" cook writes. \" should a president make a statement, no matter how ill-advised it might be, then say,'damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead'regardless of the circumstances and just to be consistent? \" roger cohen disagrees: \" red lines matter, \" he writes in the new york times, and this one \" must be upheld \" just as american red lines were upheld during world war ii and the cuban missile crisis.

Speaking publicly for the first time at a press conference in chiang rai shortly after leaving a hospital wednesday, the team described moving backward through the cave, hoping to find a way out. Eventually, they took turns digging for something to do. All the while, \" we heard the water rising towards us, \" the guardian quotes coach ekaphol chantawong as saying. \" we didn't realize how far the water could rise. \" indeed, chantawong said all members of the team â€” who appeared happy and smiling â€” agreed to explore the cave for the first time on june 23 but found their return path had been partially flooded after only an hour, per cnn. Though the boys could swim, it wasn't enough to escape, chantawong added. One boy said he thought of his mother, another said he worried about homework. All expressed their thanks and apologized for not telling their parents of their plan. Now in good health and able to return home, the boys â€” including four who are to receive thai citizenship â€” dream of becoming professional soccer players or navy seals. They also plan to join the thai monkhood as novices, as chantawong previously did, in honor of the diver who died during the rescue operation, per the guardian. \" it's for their protection, \" a grandfather of one of the boys tells the bbc. \" it's like they died, but now have been reborn. \" per the bbc, some locals feel the boys need to be spiritually cleansed based on the belief that their venture offended the spirit of a mythical princess said to have occupied the tham luang cave for centuries.",

The new york times notes that although russia has an extensive intelligence operation targeting isis, it is possible that the announcement of the leader's possible death is a tactical move intended to help russian forces by confusing and discouraging isis fighters.

According to the china daily, the women married bachelors in villages in hebei province this year and vanished en masse late last month, along with the matchmaker who charged men around $ 18,000 each to marry the women. Before disappearing, the women told their husbands they were going for a meal with other vietnamese brides in the area. Some of the men fear they have been cheated out of their cash, but according to a report in the jinghua daily, at least one woman later returned to her husband, saying she had \" lost consciousness \" after the meal and awoke in a small house far away, where she was told she would be going elsewhere to find a husband. Chinese authorities say cross-border marriage brokerages are illegal, but bride-buying is common in some rural areas of china, where men can't afford traditional betrothal gifts for local women. A gender gap caused by the one-child policy combined with a preference for boys is growing, with the official birth figures now at 118 boys for every 100 girls, reuters notes.

        "summary": "A new york judge has rejected a bid by donald trump's lawyers to throw out a state lawsuit that alleges the president disregarded the law in running his charitable foundation and used it as a wing of his presidential campaign. But, in the ruling posted friday, state supreme court justice saliann scarpulla reiterated that she would be forced to drop trump from the lawsuit if a state appeals court weighing an unrelated case decides that a sitting president can't be sued in state court. In the meantime, scarpulla said, new york attorney general barbara underwood's lawsuit alleging that trump used the nonprofit trump foundation's money to settle business disputes and boost his political fortunes can move forward, reports the ap. What you need to know: the suit seeks $ 2.8 million in restitution, the foundation's disbandment, and a 10-year ban on trump running any charities. Scarpulla rebuffed the contention of trump's lawyers that the lawsuit was politically motivated. Given the seriousness of the allegations, she said, there was no basis for finding that \" animus and bias were the sole motivating factors \" for the lawsuit. Whether trump remains a defendant in the trump foundation case hinges on how a state appeals court rules in former apprentice contestant summer zervos'defamation lawsuit against the president. Trump's lawyers argue that a sitting president can't be sued in state court over conduct outside official duties, something scarpulla and the trial judge in the zervos case reject. As for the argument that the state court doesn't have jurisdiction over the president, scarpulla wrote in her ruling that allowing the trump foundation case to proceed in state court is \" entirely consistent \" with the supreme court's 1997 ruling that forced then-president bill clinton to face a federal sexual harassment lawsuit concerning an alleged encounter while he was governor.

Monroe insisted that hopkins apologize and donate money to a migrants ' charity, but hopkins refused and instead called monroe \" social anthrax, \" per the sun. Monroe sued for libel and won, and hopkins is now on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages and legal costs. She just took the first legal steps in a bid to avoid bankruptcy. \"i ' m supposed to be jubilant and celebratory but i feel quite mixed up, \" says monroe. \" having been close to the edge of bankruptcy myself, it's a hideous situation to be in, but it was completely avoidable. \" hopkins, who now works for the far-right site rebel media, has not commented. She has previously billed herself as \" britain's most controversial columnist \" for her right-wing views, and she once drew the praise of president trump for her columns on \" the uk's muslim problems. \" buzz.ie reports that another of hopkins'tweets is now drawing attention given the new money trouble. \" the only thing people in debt have in common other than bad money management, is an ability to blame anyone but themselves, \" she wrote in 2014.",

With 94 % reporting, sanders had a 56 % to 44 % lead over hillary clinton. Unfortunately for sanders as he tries to close the gap with clinton, the win only nabs him eight of the state's 14 proportionally awarded delegates, with his opponent taking the other six. According to the hill, sanders now trails clinton by 248 pledged delegates. But more was at stake than delegates in wyoming, where cnn reports sanders was always favored due to it being rural and largely white. With the victory, sanders has now won eight of the past nine democratic contests and takes that momentum into delegate-heavy new york on april 19.",

Sanders's victory follows rising tensions between the two candidates after he questioned clinton's qualifications to run for president, a remark that snowballed into a weeklong dispute. He said wednesday that her super-pac support, iraq war vote and support of trade agreements made her unqualified. The campaign doubled down a day later, arguing that clinton and her allies had insinuated that sanders himself wasn't qualified to run, but she brushed aside those accusations. The argument appeared to die down friday when sanders said that \" of course \" clinton is qualified. Entering saturday, clinton led the race with 1,280 pledged delegates to sanders's 1,030, according to the associated press. In addition, clinton has 469 superdelegates to sanders's 31.",
            "( cnn ) bernie sanders won the wyoming democratic caucuses saturday, providing his campaign with one more jolt of momentum before the race against hillary clinton heads east. Even so, he made no gains in clinton's delegate lead, as each earned seven delegates as a result. The vermont senator was favored going into the caucuses. Wyoming is similar to other places he's won with big margins: rural, western and overwhelmingly white. The victory is sanders ' eighth win out of the last nine contests -- including a contest that counted the votes of democrats living abroad -- and a big morale booster heading into the crucial new york primary on april 19. Sanders, speaking at a rally in queens, new york, when the state's results were projected, announced the victory to his supporters after his wife, jane, joined him on stage to say they had won. \" news bulletin: we just won wyoming, \" sanders said as the room exploded into cheers. Sanders won 55.7 % of the vote to clinton's 44.3 %, giving each candidate seven delegates. That helps clinton maintain her pledged delegate lead"

        "summary": "Spike lee wants president trump to see his new movie, reports reuters, and critics want you to see it, too. Based on the true 1970s story of a black police officer who infiltrated the ku klux klan, blackkklansman has a 98 % rating on rotten tomatoes, with critics commenting on its timeliness in particular. More: \" blackkklansman is a furious, funny, blunt and brilliant confrontation with the truth. It's an alarm clock ringing in the midst of a historical nightmare, and also a symphony, the rare piece of political popular art that works in all three dimensions, \" ao scott writes in a glowing review at the new york times. He calls the film lee's \" best nondocumentary feature in more than a decade and one of his greatest. \" brian lowry at cnn agrees it's \" among lee's best films in some time. \" he \" isn't subtle about connecting the dots between the unsettling resurgence of white supremacist movements today, president trump's rhetoric and the klan of four decades ago, \" and that makes the film \" feel urgent and dishearteningly relevant. \" lowry adds it also works as an \" old-fashioned tale of undercover work. \" \" ultimately the film is a rallying cry, \" and you leave \" shaken, remembering what happened not so very long ago in the name of'very fine people on both sides, ' \" writes moira macdonald at the seattle times. But as devastating as some moments are, blackkklansman also entertains, macdonald writes, pointing out the particular comedic talents of paul walker hauser, who plays a klansman. Even when giving a history lesson, lee manages to surprise in this \" crazy, memorable, messy bombshell in classic bell-bottoms â€¦ viscerally exciting, fun and saddening all at once, \" writes colin covert at the minneapolis star tribune. John david washington offers \" a density rarely seen in true-blue cop roles, \" covert adds, while \" the supporting cast can't receive enough praise. \"",

Propublica warned of thousands dead, the loss of industries and shipping, and hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses flooded. A republican congressman said such a storm would \" kill america's economy. \" with hurricane harvey, it appears that perfect storm may be about to arrive. Experts hoped hurricane ike's near miss in 2008 would spur texas to prepare for the inevitable. It didn't, and last year the state's land commissioner said the possibility of a major hurricane hitting without the necessary preparations having been made \" keeps me up at night. \" here's what else you need to know about hurricane harvey: in its latest forecast, the ap reports harvey will likely hit texas twice â€” once this weekend and again sometime next week â€” making flooding worse in areas already expected to get up to 3 feet of rain in the next day or two. Harvey is president trump's first natural disaster, but it will be handled by president obama, at least figuratively, according to quartz. Trump hasn't filled the top spot at noaa or two of the three politically appointed positions at fema. The three roles are currently being staffed by obama holdovers. Cnet has video released from nasa showing the massive hurricane harvey as seen from the international space station. \" here's a prayer for family, friends, and everyone, \" astronaut jack fischer says. \" stay safe. \" experts tell cnn gas prices could jump between five and 15 cents due to the hurricane. \" you're seeing prices move up because refiners have to take precautionary measures, \" one analyst says. Dozens of production platforms and at least one oil rig have been evacuated. The times-picayune reports a louisiana coroner warns hurricane harvey could trigger ptsd in people who survived hurricane katrina 12 years ago. \" this is not to be taken lightly, \" charles preston says. \" you should believe the meteorologists. \" that's the message from fivethirtyeight when it comes to the deadliness of hurricane harvey. The site notes that the ability to predict winds, flooding, and hurricane paths is better than ever. Finally, texas gov.

        "summary": "Repeatedly updating facebook or scrolling through pictures of pugs on instagram are examples of activities \" significantly associated \" with an increased risk of depression, suggests a new study published in depression and anxiety. Researchers at the university of pittsburgh surveyed nearly 1,800 people between the ages of 19 and 32 about their use of 11 social media networks, including facebook, youtube, instagram, snapchat, tumblr, and pinterest, cnet reports. They found the average time spent on social media was 61 minutes per day, with approximately 30 visits to social media sites per week. But people who checked social media most frequently were 2.7 times likelier to be depressed than those who checked least frequently. And those who spent the most time on social media were 1.7 times more likely to be depressed than those who spent the least. A press release gives a few reasons why social media could be linked with depression: envy of other people's \" highly idealized representations \" of their lives, feeling like you're wasting your life on social media, and increased risk of cyber-bullying. But it's not clear social media is causing users'depression. Researcher lui yi lin says it's possible depressed people are more likely to turn to social media to \" fill a void. \" \" a common thing that people do when they start to become depressed is to isolate more, \" one expert tells mic. \" social media provides an opportunity to...

        "summary": "Lots of people talk a good game about eating more natural foods, but a new study suggests that the convenience of \" ultra-processed \" meals is just too hard to resist. Researchers found that nearly three in five of our calories come from this category, reports the los angeles times. That raises a host of health concerns, given that these foods are loaded with sugar, preservatives, artificial flavors, colors â€” generally speaking, the unpronounceable stuff in ingredient lists. So what qualifies as \" ultra-processed \"? think breakfast cereals, frozen pizzas, soda, cookies, salty snacks, etc. The study in the journal bmj open looked at what more than 9,000 participants ate over a 24-hour period and found that 58 % of the average 2,070 calories consumed qualified for the \" ultra-processed \" label. As for the rest, 28 % came from foods with zero or minimal processing â€” eggs, fish, vegetables, essentially food \" you've just ripped... Out of the ground or off a tree and shoved... In your mouth, \" explains the atlantic. Another 10 % came from foods with a higher degree of processing ( but not at the \" ultra \" level ), such as cheese, canned vegetables, bread, and cured meat. The remainder of the calories came from cooking ingredients such as olive oil. The researchers were particularly concerned that the ultra-processed foods delivered 90 % of the added sugar in participants'diets, writing that limiting their consumption \" may be a highly effective way \" to keep sugar intake under control, notes live science.

            "To design and implement effective measures to reduce added sugars, their dietary sources must be clearly identified. Added sugars can be consumed either as ingredients of dishes or drinks prepared from scratch by consumers or a cook, or as ingredients of food products manufactured by the food industry. According to market disappearance data from 2014, more than three-quarters of the sugar and high fructose corn syrup available for human consumption in the usa were used by the food industry. 12 this suggests that food products manufactured by the industry could have an important role in the excess added sugars consumption in the usa. However, to assess this role, it is essential to consider the contribution of manufactured food products to both total energy intake and the energy intake from added sugars, and, more relevantly, to quantify the relationship between their consumption and the total dietary content of added sugars. To address these questions, we performed an investigation utilising the 2009 â€“ 2010 national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ). All reports recommended limiting intake of added sugars. 1, 3 â€“ 5 in the usa, the usdgac recommended limiting added sugars to no more than 10 % of total calories. This is a challenge, as recent consumption of added sugars in the usa amounted to almost 15 % of total calories in 2005 â€“ 2010. 10, 11"

That's the takeaway from a university of toronto study that examined 1,500 \" air rage \" incidents from a single airline and found incidents rise on flights with a first-class cabin, particularly if economy passengers have to walk through the area to get to their seat. \" when they close the curtains between the cabins or they remind economy passengers to not go into ( the ) forward cabin â€¦ it reminds people that they've paid hundreds of dollars for this experience \" yet are still deprived of certain services and comforts, lead author katherine decelles tells abc news. \" when people feel a sense of deprivation and inequality, they are more likely to act out, \" she adds, per cnn. Air rage incidents including emotional outbursts or aggressive behavior typically occur 1.58 times per 1,000 flights in economy class, reports the los angeles times. But passengers were 3.84 times more likely to have an incident with a first-class cabin on board; a similar increase accompanied a 9.5-hour flight delay. Those passengers who had to travel through the first-class area while boarding were 2.18 times more likely to get angry, a rate that mimics the effects of a 15-hour delay, say researchers. The rate of incidents also spiked for first-class passengers when economy passengers tromped through their space, perhaps because they were \" more aware of their higher status \" and thus more likely \" to have entitled attitudes and to be less compassionate, \" decelles says. One psychologist suggests passengers board planes in the middle to avoid first-class envy. ( just hope your pilot remembers how to fly. )",

This after alcohol and marijuana reps battled fiercely in the debate over legalization. The liquor manufacturer that produces major brands like southern comfort and jack daniels warned about it in an sec filing, and some academic research agreed â€” including a study that saw alcohol consumption falling in states that allowed medical marijuana. \" they're smart to worry about it, \" a study co-author told the denver post last year. \" the best they can hope for is no impact. \" so are people enjoying a drink or two with their weed? hard to say, but colorado also saw increased tourism in 2014, the first year of marijuana legalization; more than 71 million tourists came and spent $ 18.6 billion, the post reports. \" legalization adds to the overall draw, \" martz tells the guardian.",

In her $ 35 million lawsuit, beth holloway says the producers duped her into believing they were investigating a legitimate lead in the case when, in fact, the six-part series was a \" pre-planned farce, \" reports the washington post. Holloway's ex-husband, dave holloway, asked her to submit dna so it could be matched against newly found remains, and beth holloway agreed, per the lawsuit. She says he never informed her it was for a tv show, which purported to follow dave holloway and a private investigator looking into a promising new avenue in the case. The suit states beth holloway truly believed her daughter had been found, but \" she was forced to wait nearly two months to discover the truth. \" no dna match emerged, and beth holloway says that's no surprise. The network and brian graden media knew \" prior to filming their series that they would not find natalee because the series was pre-conceived and was not a real-time investigation discovering new facts, \" she asserts. She argues the producers knew the bone fragments weren't natalee's before they got her dna sample and accuses them of fraudulent misrepresentation. Both companies â€” oxygen is owned by nbc universal â€” deny that. One legal expert tells the observer that beth holloway faces long odds in the case. \" what oxygen has done is contemptible â€” they've strung a mother along, giving her fake hope, \" he says. \" but whether what they've done is unlawful is up for debate. \" the show's big moment revolved around an informant who claimed to have dug up natalee's remains at the behest of longtime suspect joran van der sloot.

            "Not to be confused with the gospel of wealth prosperity theology ( sometimes referred to as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, the gospel of success, or seed faith ) [ a ] is a religious belief among some christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of god for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the bible as a contract between god and humans: if humans have faith in god, he will deliver security and prosperity. The doctrine emphasizes the importance of personal empowerment, proposing that it is god's will for his people to be happy. It is based on interpretations of the bible that are mainstream in judaism ( with respect to the hebrew bible ), though less so in christianity. The atonement ( reconciliation with god ) is interpreted to include the alleviation of sickness and poverty, which are viewed as curses to be broken by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession. It was during the healing revivals of the 1950s that prosperity theology first came to prominence in the united states, although commentators have linked the origins of its theology to the new thought movement which began in the 19th century.",

But the findings, based on surveys of 3,200 subjects, didn't hold true for men sleeping with men, the independent reports. Men who had sex exclusively with men and had had more than 20 partners actually saw twice the prostate cancer risk of men who'd never slept with men.

Researchers at the university of montreal and inrs-institut armand-frappier found that men who had slept with more than 20 women during their lifetime were 28 per cent less likely to develop the disease. They were also 19 per cent less likely to develop an aggressive type of cancer, compared to those who had had only one female sexual partner. However, the same did not apply to gay men, according to the canadian scientists. They found that having more than 20 male partners doubled the risk of prostate cancer and made an aggressive cancer five times more likely. Sleeping with one male partner did not affect the risk. Video: prostate cancer on the rise in uk meanwhile, men who were virgins were almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer as those who were sexually experienced. The findings are from the prostate cancer &amp; environment study in which 3,208 men answered questions about their lifestyle and sex lives. Of these men, 1,590 were diagnosed with prostate cancer between september 2005 and august 2009, while 1,618 men were part of the control group. Overall, men with prostate cancer were twice as likely as others to have a relative with cancer, but the study also found a possible link with their number of sexual partners. Lead researcher professor marie-elise parent, from the university of montreal, said: \" it is possible that having many female sexual partners results in a higher frequency of ejaculations, whose protective effect against prostate cancer has been previously observed in cohort studies. \" according to one theory, large numbers of ejaculations may reduce the concentration of cancer-causing substances in prostatic fluid, a constituent of semen.

        "summary": "The nearly 400-foot-long polarstern is designed to break through ice in frigid waters â€” but for an upcoming trip to study climate change, germany is going to purposely let its ship become stuck in the middle of the floes, per the bbc. In what the telegraph paints as a \" daring plan, \" the polarstern will embark on its 1,550-mile trip sometime in 2019, at which point it will sail into arctic sea ice, allowing itself to become trapped in the ice and then drift with it across the north pole. The frigid adventure, which is said to be the biggest arctic research project ever, \" will give us a new and absolutely fascinating insight into the climate system \" there, professor markus rex, who's leading the mosaic project, tells the bbc. As the polarstern floats along in \" sea-ice lagrangian mode, \" scientists from several dozen research entities will gather data on the local waters and atmosphere, all of which will be analyzed to make more sense of the major climate changes going on at the top of the world ( january's measurement of arctic sea ice was said to be the lowest ever recorded ). Rex tells the telegraph this is really the only way to do a study at the north pole during the winter, as thick ice during that time of year is impossible to break through, and it's too dangerous and unwieldy to head onto the ice in snowmobiles with all of the necessary gear. Not that the ice-bound journey, which is expected to take about a year, is going to be an easy sail: it will be freezing and completely dark around the clock during the winter months, and polar bears will be on the prowl. ( scientists say the warm temps in the arctic are \" alarming. \" )",

That's because authorities had covered the area with a sheet so witnesses wouldn't see lockett's groin. It wasn't until about 20 minutes after the injections began that a doctor realized the vein had collapsed and that the drugs \" had either absorbed into tissue, leaked out or both. \" the execution was then called off, and lockett was pronounced dead 10 minutes later, though the timeline provides no details on what occurred during those 10 minutes. As for the tasering, it happened about 5: 50am, when lockett refused to be restrained to have x-rays taken as part of the pre-execution protocol. When he finally arrived in a medical room after being subdued, doctors discovered that he had a self-inflicted cut on his arm, though it wasn't serious enough to merit stitches, reports usa today. In his report to gov. Mary fallin, prison chief robert patton recommended an indefinite stay of executions in the state until new procedures can be written and staffers trained.",

            "Clayton lockett, the death-row inmate who was the subject of a botched execution by the state of oklahoma, was tasered by prison staff and had cut his own arm on the day of the failed procedure, according to a timeline released by the state's corrections chief on thursday. The document released by the director of the corrections department, robert patton, shows that medical staff could not find a suitable vein on any of his limbs in which to inject the lethal drugs intended to kill him, and had to use his groin instead. Lockett died, apparently from a heart attack, 43 minutes after his attempted execution began and 10 minutes after it had been called off. Patton recommended an indefinite stay of executions in oklahoma until procedures for judicial killings in the state are completely rewritten and staff retrained. The execution of another inmate, charles warner, also due to have been carried out on tuesday, has already been postponed. \"it will take several days or possibly weeks to refine the new protocols, \" patton wrote in a letter to the republican governor of oklahoma, mary fallin. \"once written, staff will require extensive training and understanding of new protocols before an execution can be scheduled. I recommend asking the court of criminal appeals to issue an indefinite stay of execution. \" patton said he supported an \"external investigation \" of lockett's death. Fallin said on thursday that she had the authority to grant a 60-day moratorium before the attorney general would petition the appeals court for an extension. \"we need to take as long as possible to get the answer right, \" she told reporters. Alex weintz, a spokesman for fallin, said the state \"will not proceed with any executions until department of corrections protocols can be reviewed and updated, and staff then trained to implement those new protocols. \" the timeline published by oklahoma details a chaotic scene in the death chamber before and during the failed execution, as staff struggle to place an intravenous line into lockett, report that he was unconscious, but then did not spot that the iv connection had failed because they had covered lockett groin with a sheet, to prevent that area of his body"
