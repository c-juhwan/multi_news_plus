Nick — who smithsonian explains was a wealthy bishop known for leaving coins in the shoes of the poor — is believed to have died in 343 ad in what is now turkey. The bone tested by oxford scientists — a partial pelvis in the possession of the relic-collecting rev.

Dr. Georges kazan tells the bbc the bone \" could in fact be genuine, \" but there's no way to prove that. Bones purporting to belong to st. Nicholas can be found around the world, according to a press release. Most experts believe st. Nicholas'remains were stolen from their original resting place in turkey in 1087 and taken to a church in bari, italy. But a church in venice claims it has the true remains. There are also claims the remains are in ireland, and o ' neill's pelvis actually came from a church in france. Scientists now want to conduct dna tests on the bones to find out which come from the same person. ( and if that weren't enough, archaeologists claimed in october they found st.

A first glance at the fake olympic decathlete jersey, running shorts, and gold medals from vendor costume agent doesn't reveal anything particularly noteworthy, but the red wig and its product name add more context: the \" bruce caitlyn jenner i am cait \" costume, originally selling for about $ 45 through third-party sites like ebay and amazon, riled up the lgbt community, which says it's offensive to transgender people — especially since the model wearing the costume in the original ad is a guy sporting a soul patch and mustache. Tmz reported earlier this week that, despite the backlash, costume agent was holding tight in keeping the costume up for sale. \" it's a costume. It's funny, \" a rep said tuesday. The company has since changed its tune. \" as of this morning, we've decided to stop selling the costume, \" a rep for costume agent told nbc news on wednesday. \" after hearing concerns from those who are offended, regardless of our own thoughts and opinions, we decided to remove it. \" part of the controversy was embedded in the name of the costume itself: a transgender advocate tells nbc that \" bruce \" is caitlyn jenner's \" dead \" name — the name a transgender person used before transitioning, and a big no-no to use afterward. The costume is still available, at least for the moment, through one third-party seller on amazon. ( it's not the first time there's been a brouhaha over a caitlyn halloween costume. )",

Police determined he died of blunt force trauma, though they've been unable to point to a motive, reports the baltimore sun. Nothing appeared to have been stolen from the home and \" whatever they needed from him, they could have easily gotten, \" notes baltimore police department spokesman tj smith. Instead, the apparent intruders opted to kill tate in a way that was \" brutal \" and \" absolutely inhumane, \" says smith, whose own brother was killed in a break-in weeks ago. There aren't \" enough words to describe how disgusting an act of violence this is, \" he adds, per the post. Smith vows police will \" hunt down and find the evil, despicable human being responsible for this act, \" noting \" we need answers, and sadly we don't have any, \" per the sun.

Warren's office declined comment, per abc, and a clinton spokeswoman simply said in a statement, \" we're honored to have 13 women senators coming together to endorse and support hillary clinton. This is a sign of the broad support clinton is receiving from women across the country who know she ' ll fight for us. \" maryland sen.

Patricia edelen, 47, pleaded not guilty; she was ordered not to have any contact with the victim, who is in the process of selling the house. The incident went viral after monica davis, the victim's realtor, posted a video on social media showing the vandalism, which took place less than three miles away from the location where, mere hours later, the ohio city's annual african american parade would be kicking off. Davis called for the video to go viral, and it did: soon, community members were at the house, power washing and scrubbing away the spray-painted words, the toledo blade reports. \" this morning we had a great time celebrating our community's diversity at the african american festival parade. At the same time, a family in our community experienced a hate crime, \" mayor wade kapszukiewicz posted on facebook on saturday. But since the alleged crime does not meet the federal standards for a hate crime, the ethnic intimidation charge was filed, which increases the severity of the other misdemeanor charges edelen is facing — criminal mischief, criminal damaging, and obstructing official business. Police tell the washington post the charge is rarely used. A neighbor caught edelen on video allegedly vandalizing the home, and police used the recording to identify her, abc 13 reports. They had to force their way into her house to arrest her saturday night after she refused to allow them in. \" i have never been more dismayed and [ then ] more proud of toledo than today, \" a resident posted saturday along with pictures of the clean-up.",

Washtenaw county sheriff's office deputies reported the 28-year-old woman got off the bus about 6 p.m. Monday in the area of the 3000 block of roundtree boulevard in ypsilanti township. The woman told investigators she got off the bus in the area and was walking home through an apartment parking lot. Three men approached her, with one of them using a homophobic slur, calling her a derogatory name for a woman and asking her if she had recently been on the news. A man then punched her in the face, knocking her to the ground and causing her to lose consciousness. When she woke up, one of the men was kicking her in the torso. The men then fled from the area on foot. One of the men is described as white, 5-feet-10 inches to 5-feet-11 inches tall, heavy set and with a low or husky voice. The other two men could not be identified. Investigators said the woman has recently been in the news because she was able to marry her partner in washtenaw county.

Judith permar, 56, is believed to have arrived at the clothing drop-off box around 2am and stood on a stepstool to reach her arm inside. According to philly.com, police say she was pulling bags out of the bin when her stool collapsed and her arm got stuck inside with her feet dangling off the ground. Permar's body was found around 8: 30am with her black hummer still running nearby. She died from blunt force trauma — she had a broken arm and wrist — and had hypothermia. Her death was ruled an accident, wnep reports. \" she was fishing bags out and the ladder she was standing on gave way, and she couldn't get her hand loose, \" says mount carmel police chief brian hollenbush. He adds that he knew permar and wouldn't expect her to be stealing clothes from a donation bin. However, bags from inside the bin were found on the ground, and police received a report of a woman in a black hummer taking clothes from the same drop-off box back in november. Her son, meanwhile, says his mother donated to such clothing bins frequently. In a message to family and friends, permar's daughter remembered her as a \" fun-loving person. \" ( bumble bee pleaded guilty in a worker's death inside a giant oven. )",

The guardian reports that nearly 30 years after the film was released, thousands of people still come to virginia's mountain lake lodge — stand-in for the fictional kellerman's resort — only to find its famous lake now more of a muddy pit. The water, which cooled houseman and castle as they practiced their signature lift, completely disappeared in 2006, killing a bunch of fish. It was largely empty again beginning in 2008, that year revealing the bones of a missing 1920s fisherman. The lake has remained mostly empty since. The water's recurring disappearances can be explained by a \" plumbing system \" unique in the world to mountain lake, environmental studies professor jon cawley tells the guardian. He says water drains through holes in the lake bed to clear out old sediment. This process is actually part of a cycle, suggesting the lake should eventually be bigger and deeper someday. To appease disappointed fans, the lodge actually plugged the holes in 2013, only to have a new one open up. It's not all bad news for dirty dancing fans, however.

        "summary": "A uk resident who suffered headaches and seizures for four years was ultimately handed an unusual explanation for his woes: there was a worm in his brain, reports the guardian. Specifically, doctors removed a 1-centimeter-long tapeworm called spirometra erinaceieuropaei. Based on scans taken over several years, the worm traveled about 2 inches from the right side of his brain to the left, though doctors didn't realize it was a worm until they conducted a biopsy. The 50-year-old patient is mostly fine, though he's still suffering some issues due to having served as host for the parasite. This particular tapeworm most generally affects amphibians and crustaceans, and is exceedingly rare in humans: in roughly six decades, only 300 cases have been recorded. The one upside is that scientists were able to sequence its genome, they report via eureka alert. That should enable them to more easily identify and treat for it in the future. \"this genome will act as a reference, so that when new treatments are developed for the more common tapeworms, scientists can cross-check whether they are also likely to be effective against this very rare infection, \" says a cambridge geneticist. It's not clear how the man got infected, but the best guess is that he picked it up on a visit to china, perhaps from infected meat or water. The mouthless tapeworm is thought to have absorbed nutrients from the brain directly into its body. ( in india, doctors once found a worm inside a patient's eye. )",

            "For the first time, the genome of a rarely seen tapeworm has been sequenced.

The tapeworm, spirometra erinaceieuropaei, has been reported only 300 times worldwide since 1953 and has never been seen before in the uk. The worm causes sparganosis: inflammation of the body's tissues in response to the parasite. When this occurs in the brain, it can cause seizures, memory loss and headaches. The worm's rarity means that little is known about its complex lifecycle and biology, however it is thought that people may be infected by accidently consuming tiny infected crustaceans from lakes, eating raw meat from reptiles and amphibians, or by using a raw frog poultice - a chinese remedy to calm sore eyes",

But during a stop at a chilean fort near antarctica on oct. 30, 1849, gauguin's father, clovis, died suddenly of a heart aneurysm. His family saw him buried, but the next day were forced to continue on to lima. Three years later, fuerte bulnes was demolished. Archaeologists working there have now uncovered a cemetery of 12 skeletons, one of which belongs to gauguin's father, art historian caroline boyle-turner argues in a new book, per the art newspaper. \" the scientific evidence is conclusive, \" says boyle-turner, who cites the skeleton being the only one of the 12 that belongs to a european man as one telling clue.

Animal cruelty, organized into four categories ( simple or gross neglect, intentional abuse and torture, animal sexual abuse, and organized abuse like dogfighting and cockfighting ), will have its own category within the national incident-based reporting system, but actually reporting to nibrs is voluntary, so animal rights advocates must convince local law enforcement agencies to do so. Once in the nibrs, law enforcement and animal rights advocates will be able to access the age, criminal history, and location of convicted animal abusers, and having enough data could help authorities to see trends or notice \" hotspots \" of activity on which they should focus resources. \" when the fbi says animal cruelty is important and we are going to track it, it sends a message to others in law enforcement and the community at large saying 'pay attention to this, ' \" says a senior adviser at the animal welfare institute, which worked with the fbi on making the change.",

Lebow, who teaches political theory at king's college london, tried to defuse the situation by writing to sharoni, who teaches women's studies at merrimack college in massachusetts, that he meant no offense. He added that he was worried her \" frivolous \" complaint might detract from the investigation of more serious offenses. The isa then came down against lebow, criticizing both his original joke and his subsequent characterization of the complaint as \" frivolous, \" and demanded that he apologize to sharoni. He refuses, saying this is \" political correctness \" run amok. Sharoni, for her part, tells columnist ruth marcus of the washington post ( who originally broke the story ) that the cry of \" political correctness \" is too often a dodge used by people to get away with offensive behavior. Marcus sees fault on both sides. \" she shouldn't have leaped to file a grievance; he shouldn't have added fuel by labeling her charge ' frivolous. ' \" ultimately, though, marcus sides with lebow, calling sharoni's complaint \" counterproductive. \" it's not clear what happens if lebow keeps up his refusal to apologize, notes insider higher ed, but he could get booted from the isa.",

That means that when roeder appeared in court for a hearing friday, he had not yet met his baby son, born just 30 days prior. Ashley was in the same kentucky courtroom for her own hearing, and as james came out for his case to be called, \" i saw her try to hold the baby up, \" judge amber wolf tells wdrb. \" it occurred to me after we finished this case that he had not met his baby. \" she says roeder had expressed concern before his son's birth about whether he'd be able to meet the boy right away. That's when wolf made a decision that caused happy tears in her courtroom, in a scene that was captured on video. Wolf asked ashley roeder if she wanted james to meet his son, and ashley said yes. Wolf called james back, called ashley up to the bench, and explained that a no-contact order still applied, but that she was making a temporary exception \" so that you can meet this baby. This is your son. \" ashley handed james the baby, and he held and kissed him. \" if you all aren't teared up, then you're just heartless, \" the judge said to those in the courtroom. The roeders were arrested on may 20, accused of stealing six flat-screen tvs from a warehouse on feb. 9. As kmbc reports, wolf is the same judge who recently made headlines for her anger over an inmate who showed up in court sans pants.",

During wednesday's presidential debate, trump called hillary clinton \" such a nasty woman \" while she was answering a question about social security and medicare. Babin, a dentist and first-time congressman from texas, was asked thursday if trump's comment was appropriate. The self-described \" genteel southerner \" responded by accusing clinton of \" saying some nasty things, \" cnn reports. Babin also said he thinks \" she's done some nasty things. \" all of which, he finally agreed, make her a \" nasty woman. \" but it was his statement that \" sometimes a lady needs to be told when she's being nasty \" that brought the \" relatively obscure \" congressman — as the american-statesman calls babin — into the national dialogue, leading to slate questioning his qualifications as a genteel southerner. \" speaking of women like they're untrained dogs who must be reprimanded when they displease their masters runs entirely counter to the pillars of gentility, \" it suggests.",

The vid is almost certainly fake, and gawker has the details on how you can tell: red flag no 1: the video is youtube user mrnuclearcat's only upload. The cgi used to create the bird is flawed — its wings disappear at one point, its shadow is inconsistent, and when it drops its cargo, the baby somehow manages to float upward for a second. Speaking of cgi, there's a 3d animation school in montreal known for fake videos like this one, part of its \" hoax the internet \" competition. Perhaps we've seen the new winner? not a single media source in canada picked up on the footage. Then there are the experts: ornithologist kenn kaufman calls the video \" stupid garbage. \" he explains that the golden eagle \" is a scarce visitor in the montreal area, but the bird in the video is not a golden eagle, nor anything else that occurs in the wild in north america. This was clearly a setup: using a falconer's bird, and probably a fake toddler. \" but don't let that get you down if you breathlessly shared all over social media: the huffington post and gawker itself were duped.",

Update: a blog post on the montreal animation school centre nad website claims that the video was a hoax created by their students. The post states: the \"golden eagle snatches kid \" video, uploaded to youtube on the evening of december 18, was made by normand archambault, loïc mireault and félix marquis-poulin, students at centre nad, in the production simulation workshop class of the bachelors degree in 3d animation and digital design."

He, too, chides us alleged war-lovers, reminding us of iraq, where some of us were wrong ( guilty ) and some duplicitous ( not guilty ), and offers instruction on the difficulties and complexities of intervention — shiites, sunnis, alawites and all the rest, a veritable casting call for \"lawrence of arabia. \" unmentioned is that those difficulties have been compounded by the furious inaction of the obama administration. The president has called on bashar al-assad to go — and predicted he would — but here he remains, more than two years into the war and more than 80,000 dead along the way. The syrian dictator may well win this thing. He now has the fresh troops of hezbollah and, possibly soon, russian s-300 antiaircraft missiles, which could well make imposing a no-fly zone a non-starter. What perplexes me is that a good deal of this patronizing criticism of we interveners comes from the left. The argument is that syria would be iraq all over again. This is tendentious. The whole idea of intervening early — it may already be too late — was not to impose some u.s.-friendly regime but merely to stop the killing and avoid an immense humanitarian calamity. Early on, this was possible. The"

Soon after we were joined by archive-it partner washington university in st. Louis, mo who contributed lists of urls and solicited urls from communities in and around ferguson. Maryland institute for technology in the humanities contributed a significant number of urls extracted from tweets about michael brown and ferguson. In december we expanded the collection to include content related to the july 17th chokehold death of eric garner in staten island, ny, and the reactions around the country to the acquittal of the police officers in both cases. The collection then progressed further to reflect the movement building in reaction to police violence against people of color. Today the #blacklivesmatter web archive contains news articles, blogs, social media, and other websites related to ferguson, michael brown, eric garner, protests and demonstrations around the country, and seeks to document the movement as it grows and evolves.

The piano itself, which was not a part of the local \" pianos in the parks \" program, came with a clue: the business card of a piano tuner taped to the bottom. Talking to the tuner, journalists at kboi2 were able to track down the man who'd owned it when it was tuned in 2012, and who gave it away for free to gina matassa, daughter of well-known jazz singer greta matassa. When the two determined that the piano was beyond repair, gina paid to have someone haul it away, and the son of that man, kaare carlsen, was the one who took two friends, the piano, and an all-terrain dolly into the forest. \" well, there's a big problem with pianos going to dumps these days, \" he told kboi2. He says he ' ll take it away soon, before it litters its surroundings in any way.

How the narrative is unfolding: the crime: it's a pretty horrific one, described by one investigator as \" the worst bloodbath i have ever seen. \" the three victims, found in a waltham, mass., apartment, had their throats slashed to such a degree that their heads were nearly cut off. The odd details: someone ( ostensibly the killer ) sprinkled marijuana on their bodies; drugs and $ 5,000 were left in the apartment. The investigator also notes, \" there was no forced entry, it was clear that the victims had let the killer in. \" how tsarnaev is connected: he sometimes trained at the same gym as one of the victims, 25-year-old brendan mess. They lived near each other in cambridge, and officials think mess may have even bunked at tsarnaev's place on occasion.

The sources say flight 370 appears to have diverted west, then followed an airline flight corridor typically used to fly to the middle east or europe. The data shows an unidentified jet believed to be flight 370 was following \" a route between navigational waypoints, \" which are used to help pilots navigate, suggesting someone who knew how to fly a plane was at the helm. The plane's final appearance on that radar indicated it was on a path toward india's andaman islands. \" we are looking at sabotage, with hijack still [ in ] the cards, \" says one of the sources, a senior malaysian police official. More: evidence also continues to mount that the plane flew for hours after it was last in contact with ground controllers. All of the new information has led some searches to be redirected to the indian ocean, the new york times reports. A senior pentagon official says that both malaysian and us authorities are \" looking pretty closely \" at the possibility the jet crashed in that ocean. The plane's two communication systems ( a data reporting system and transponder ) appear to have been shut down separately, 14 minutes apart, indicating they were shut off deliberately and not as the result of a catastrophic failure, two us officials tell abc news.

        "summary": "China's president calls it the \" project of the century: \" a sweeping new version of the ancient silk road designed, according to china, to promote global development. Leaders from 30 nations issued a joint endorsement monday as part of a 2-day meeting that counted vladimir putin and recep tayyip erdogan among attendees but saw no major western leaders present, the ap reports. ( the us delegation was led by the national security council's asia director. ) reuters reports xi jinping on sunday pledged another $ 124 billion for the \" belt and road \" initiative, which was first announced in 2013. China's line is that it's a purely commercial effort. Some foreign diplomats and political analysts aren't so sure. What you need to know: what it is: as sky news puts it, the initiative's goal is to \" recreate the trading routes of old overland and sea through central asia, to europe and beyond. \" the recreating part means investing massive sums in everything from high-speed railways and ports to airports and telecom projects in more than 60 countries, in what would be china's most ambitious foreign project ever. The numbers: \" the scope is always changing, \" reports the washington post, so the estimates run the gamut from $ 900 billion and up — way up. Nbc news puts the estimated price tag at $ 1.4 trillion, and notes that's 11 times the cost ( converted into today's dollars ) spent rebuilding post-wwii under the marshall plan. Specific plans: one vision is to lay so much high-speed rail track that you could go from beijing to london in two days, notes nbc. It also flags a port effort in pakistan that would facilitate new trade routes to china's western xinjiang region, and a china-myanmar pipeline that will give beijing a new way to access middle east crude. From xi's mouth: he hopes the plan \" will unleash new forces for global economic growth \" free of a political agenda. That claim has raised eyebrows among western diplomats who wonder if china is making a move to boost its exports at the expense of us influence in asia. The skepticism: al jazeera's adrian brown's take: it ' ll cost a \" phenomenal sum of money, so many people are asking where is this money going to come from and [ saying ] that china is acting out of self-interest [ as it ] needs to get its own economy moving again and helping the economy of countries that depend on china. \" africa-specific skepticism: a post at quartz likens the new silk road to colonial britain '",

And what they've learned, per their new study in nature, is that antarctica wasn't late to the party during the planet's last ice age. As science world report explains, the northern hemisphere's ice age ended some 20,000 years ago, but scientists believed west antarctica didn't experience that end for another 2,000 years. But the ice core indicates warming happened between 2,000 and 4,000 years earlier than thought, syncing it with the rest of the planet. \" sometimes we think of antarctica as this passive continent waiting for other things to act on it, \" says one researcher. \" but here it is showing changes before it ' knows ' what the north is doing. \" researchers say that better understanding the past could help them better predict what's coming: livescience calls west antarctica \" one of the fastest-warming places on the planet \" today; the region's center has warmed three times faster than the average rate of global warming, some 4.4 degrees since 1958.",

Researchers have found a correlation between one aspect of nose shape and climate, according to a study published thursday in plos genetics. The new york times explains that in addition to helping people smell, noses warm and moisten air before it hits the lungs. \" cold and dry air is not good for our internal airways, \" researcher arslan zaidi tells the guardian. That's why scientists have long suspected that noses across the world were shaped by their local climates. Previously that hypothesis had only been supported through skull measurements, according to a press release. But zaidi and his team used 3d modeling to measure seven nose traits of 476 living volunteers from west africa, east asia, northern europe, and south asia. Researchers found that nostril width was the only nose measurement that differed across regions more than would be accounted for by random genetic mutation. Wider nostrils were found in people from humid, warm places; narrower nostrils were found in cold, dry climates. The biggest difference was found in northern europeans, meaning narrow nostrils seem to improve the ability to heat and humidify the air. And while the study showed natural selection played a part in nostril width, climate isn't necessarily the only explanation. Zaidi and his team admit the types of noses seen as sexy by different cultures may also play a part. As always, more research is needed. ( it's a little gross, but snot is also crucial. )",

        "summary": "President trump has settled on callista gingrich as the us ambassador to the vatican, cnn reported first sunday night, saying the choice has been made but the process has been hung up by the office of government ethics, which needs to give its approval. The network reports a formal nomination of the wife of former house speaker newt gingrich could come as soon as this week, with trump wanting it to be made before his may 24 meeting with pope francis. That her name was being floated has been known since january — newt himself told cnn as much shortly after trump became president. Newt wouldn't say much to the new york times sunday night beyond noting both he and his wife had been advised to \" be very cautious \" until an announcement was made. The times has more on callista's relationship with catholicism: she helped newt convert and sings in the basilica of the national shrine choir, but it points out she had a hand in the demise of newt's third marriage. An opinion piece at the national catholic reporter makes the case that \" the vatican cares less about the moral history of an ambassadorial nominee than it does about the nominee's access to the decision-makers in the administration. \" as for the administration, axios contributes this to the rumor mill: \" about six weeks ago... Trump told our source he was reluctant to send callista to the vatican because he likes seeing her husband newt defending him on tv. Our source told the president they were sure satellite hook-ups could be arranged for newt at the holy see. \" ( in other vatican news, pope francis is not convinced by these famed mary apparitions. )",

In 2011, robert crouse was arrested after police found 55 marijuana plants and more than 6 pounds of pot in his house, according to the denver post. He was acquitted because he was a registered medical marijuana patient and demanded police fulfill a colorado law that required them to take care of seized marijuana and marijuana plants and return them in a usable condition. Instead, he got moldy pot back and sued. Police \" hated \" the colorado law. And now with monday's supreme court ruling, they can go back to destroying any and all marijuana seized during a criminal investigation, kktv reports. In the 4-3 ruling, the state supreme court found that following the state's law requiring the return of seized marijuana would technically make officers \" distributors \" in violation of federal law. A former us attorney says that would make officers vulnerable to federal prosecution. The decision was authored by judge allison eid, said to be a potential trump supreme court nominee.

Crouse was later acquitted of marijuana-related drug crimes after he asserted he that he was in lawful possession of the drug for medical purpose under colorado law.

        "summary": "The problems plaguing healthcare.gov were entirely foreseeable to those who built it: facing high stress and what they called last-minute changes from their bosses, developers worked insane hours and pounded energy drinks for months to put together what the ap calls a \" mind-numbingly complex system \" — and when they were finished, the integration testing was performed not by outside experts from private software firms, but by government officials. The day before it went online, testers saw it crash under the weight of just a few hundred users, the washington post reports. Insurers who tested the product a month before its release called for a slower, state-by-state rollout due to persistent problems. Even by sept. 26, no one had tested the full user enrollment process, even though everyone knew oct. 1 was the drop-dead deadline. \" we named it the tyranny of the october 1 date, \" says one project insider. The site is a \" data services hub, \" or, as the ap explains, \" a traffic cop for managing information \" — and there's a lot of it. The site links to other government networks ranging from the irs to the peace corps, and the verification of applicant data is complex. Officials don't plan to postpone the individual mandate to get health insurance, however, though fox notes that marco rubio plans to introduce a bill that would delay it until healthcare.gov is \" up and running and effectively working for six months, consecutive. \" ( worth noting: the process can be done over the phone. The ap has details. )",

        "summary": "Trump place no more? a new york supreme court judge ruled thursday that the manhattan condominium building can remove the president's name from its building, the new york times reports. In 2000, the building at 200 riverside boulevard entered into a licensing agreement with djt holdings, one of trump's companies, giving the 46-story building the right to use the trump name. But in january, the condominium board asked the court to declare that the licensing agreement does not actually require it to use trump's name. Now that the court has ruled in the board's favor, the building's 377 condo owners can vote on whether to remove trump's name. The judge appeared to indicate that removing the letters from the building would be changing the building's name, which requires a two-thirds majority vote, the washington post reports. After trump's election, 253 of those owners participated in a straw poll that found nearly two-thirds of them wanted to remove the name, but a lawyer for a trump subsidiary sent a letter warning that if the board attempted to do so, trump would \" commence appropriate legal proceedings to not only prevent such unauthorized action, but to also recover the significant amount of damages, costs and attorney's fees. \" in court papers, trump organization lawyers argued that the building owners were only charged $ 1 to use trump's name and that, in addition to the single dollar, the owners were giving \" assurance \" that the name would appear on the building \" in perpetuity. \" but the judge found no evidence in the four-page agreement of that deal. The trump organization will still manage the building; its contract runs until 2019. Other trump-branded buildings in new york as well as panama city and toronto have recently removed his name as well.",

Unions at heart of dispute with most of the american public emerging from debt-ceiling-debate overload, the facts of the funding stalemate seemed bewildering. Unlike the debt talks, in which trillions of dollars were in play, the faa funding has been stalled by matters that hold greater importance to members of congress than to the majority of the flying public. Primary among them is a partisan split over the rules that govern union efforts to organize airline workers. There have been 20 short-term funding bills for the faa since september 2007. Even when democrats controlled both chambers, agreement on long-term funding was elusive.

Anton pilipa, 39, who was last seen in scarborough in 2012, flew back to toronto monday morning with his brother stefan after being released from a hospital in the northern brazilian city of manaus. Stefan pilipa told cbc toronto he believes his brother — who had lived in toronto, montreal and british columbia before disappearing — had mental health problems when he went missing. He believes anton, whom he describes as an anti-poverty activist, got to brazil at least part of the way by walking, sometimes with no shoes, as well as hitchhiking and hiding in the back of transport trucks.

Anton pilipa, 39, who was last seen in scarborough in 2012, flew back to toronto monday morning with his brother stefan after being released from a hospital in the northern brazilian city of manaus. Stefan pilipa told cbc toronto he believes his brother — who had lived in toronto, montreal and british columbia before disappearing — had mental health problems when he went missing. He believes anton, whom he describes as an anti-poverty activist, got to brazil at least part of the way by walking, sometimes with no shoes, as well as hitchhiking and hiding in the back of transport trucks.

Police arrested two men yesterday, aged 20 and 24 respectively, accusing them of conspiring to commit computer misuse under the kayla moniker, the telegraph reports, noting that kayla's twitter feed has been inactive since yesterday. According to this march forbes profile, kayla was responsible for revealing that the now-former-ceo of tech security company hbgary had proposed a campaign of intimidation against wikileaks donors. In the profile, kayla plays the role of a teen girl — though she won't speak to the writer on the phone to confirm her age. Police arrested two other alleged hackers yesterday as well, according to the bbc. The four all came from different parts of the country, and all are in their 20s.",

        "summary": "As napoleon bonaparte's forces moved toward moscow in the autumn of 1812, russian general mikhail kutuzov burned his own city, fled east, and left moscow open to invaders. But what some supposed were the actions of a madman instead proved visionary, as napoleon's troops couldn't handle the early and brutal russian winter and soon abandoned moscow for paris. Kutuzov's decision to flee — rather than face napoleon and almost certain defeat — ultimately saved russia, and researchers are now looking at the role french neurosurgeon jean massot may have had on history. In the neurosurgical focus, the researchers recount kutuzov's \" seemingly two mortal wounds \": he was twice shot in the head while fighting the turks in 1774 and 1788, with the first bullet likely causing front lobe damage that spurred erratic behavior; one general wrote of his \" weakened mental strength. \" after two years of what a press release calls \" medical sleuthing, \" the researchers write of the possible \" unsung hero of this saga \": massot, who \" used his expertise perhaps twice \" to save kutuzov's life. While exactly what happened to the man's brain will likely remain a mystery ( it hasn't been examined since the autopsy in april 1813 ), the researchers for the first time gathered details about massot and the \" skilled neurosurgical care \" he provided. As lead researcher mark c. Preul puts it, \" we wanted to find out what really happened, \" and he and his team concluded that \" the best neurosurgical technique of the day seems to have been overlooked as a considerable part of kutuzov's success. \" fusion highlights this line from massot himself: \" if we had not been the witnesses... We would have considered the story about kutozov's wounds a fairy tale. \" ( it turns out napoleon's waterloo didn't come at waterloo. )",

More than eight out of 10 beers sold in the country will have the labels, fortune reports.

Anheuser-busch inbev, millercoors, heineken, constellation brands, north american breweries, and the craft brew alliance all agreed to the new guidelines. The labels will also include information about carbohydrates, protein, fat, and of course, alcohol by volume. Prior to a may 2013 ruling by the us treasury's alcohol tax and trade bureau, alcoholic beverage companies weren't actually allowed to include nutritional information on their labels, though many brewers have recently been offering the information online. And, as live science notes, even after that ruling, many alcoholic beverage manufacturers weren't required to list nutritional info because their products are regulated differently than other food and beverage products.

The statement issued online in arabic and french hails the \" miracles \" carried out by \" eight brothers wearing explosive vests and assault rifles \" in paris, which the statement calls the \" capital of abomination and perversion, \" the bbc reports. Security analyst charlie winter tells the guardian that he has seen huge amounts of isis propaganda and he believes the statement is definitely from the group, though it was \" put together hastily \" and it is not clear whether the attacks that killed 127 people were directly ordered by isis or only inspired by the group. The statement warned that france and other nations taking part in anti-isis strikes will remain a top target and the \" scent of death will not leave their nostrils as long as they partake in the crusader campaign \". Isis also released a video in which a militant warned that france would not live in peace as long as it took part in the us-led bombing campaign against the group, reports reuters. Analysts say the attacks — including an assault on a concert hall in which at least 87 young people were slaughtered — seem more likely to be the work of isis than of al-qaeda, which now tries to avoid attacks that could accidentally kill muslim civilians, the new york times reports. In other developments: the site intelligence group says online celebrations by isis supporters suggest the militant group knew the attack was going to take place, the times notes. \" the way is supporters have embraced this attack appears much more coordinated at a much earlier stage than massive reactions to past attacks, \" site said: a source tells cnn that one of the attackers has been identified as a french national who was known to police. A police source says a syrian passport was found near the body of another attacker, according to french media. A us state department says at least one american is among the 200 people injured in the attacks, the guardian reports. He did not comment on whether americans had been killed but said: \" the us embassy in paris is working around the clock to assist american citizens affected by this tragedy. \" while many world leaders expressed their sorrow, syria's president bashar al-assad is blaming the attacks on french support for the opposition in the country's civil war, the washington post reports. \" wrong polices adopted by western states, particularly france, toward events in the region, and its ignorance of the support of a number of its allies to terrorists are reasons behind the expansion of terrorism, \" he said.

That's precisely why records detailing the pride and prejudice author's impending nuptials to two separate men are so remarkable, according to historians. In honor of the 200th anniversary of the british author's death, hampshire archives in the uk plans to showcase two fake marriage entries austen is believed to have written in a register in her home parish of steventon, england, where her father was rector, when she was only a teenager. The announcements of upcoming marriages, written in the late 18th century, identify austen's apparent betrothed as henry fitzwilliam of london and edmund mortimer of liverpool, reports afp. While it isn't clear if either man actually existed, austen did strike up an early romance with tom lefroy, who would become lord chief justice of ireland. However, his family objected to the relationship — detailed in the 2007 film becoming jane — for financial reasons, reports history extra. Austen is later said to have fallen in love with a clergymen who died or married someone else. She eventually accepted a proposal from harris bigg-wither, the younger brother of friends, but reportedly rescinded her acceptance the next day.
