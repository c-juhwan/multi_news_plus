He wants to solve it in a way that will endure for decades. \" bob woodward, meanwhile, was impressed with the \" wide-ranging and methodical \" bezos. The soon-to-be owner, for his part, let staffers in on his thinking. A few nuggets, via those who attended the meetings and the post itself: \" if it's hopeless, i would feel sorry for you guys, but i wouldn't want to join you, \" he said, per journalist cara ann kelly. Still, \"what's been happening over the last several years can't continue to happen. \" \" it should be as easy to get a subscription to the post as it is to buy diapers on amazon. \" \" people will buy a package, \" but \" they will not pay for ( an individual ) story. \" \" all businesses need to be forever young... If your customer base ages with you as a company, you're woolworth's. \" as to content: \" don't be boring. \"",

Sanctuary director david oosthuizen said the injured student, whom he did not name, was from the university of texas, san antonio ( utsa ), and was studying for a masters degree in anthropology and primatology. He was working as a guide and was with a group of tourists at an enclosure holding adult male chimpanzees when he was attacked by two of the larger males, called mickey and amadeus. \" the guy was just too close to the fence, they tried to pull him in, \" he told reuters. Sanctuary staff moved quickly to rescue him and move the visitors to safety. The victim was rushed to the nearest hospital and was being treated. Asked what might have triggered the attack, oosthuizen said abused",
            "A university of texas at san antonio graduate student was in critical condition friday after two chimpanzees mauled him at a sanctuary for the animals in northeastern south africa. A utsa spokeswoman confirmed that anthropology graduate student andrew f. Oberle, 26, was injured in the attack at the jane goodall institute south africa chimpanzee eden near nelspruit on thursday. He lost an ear and several fingers and toes, in addition to other injuries, the telegraph of london reported. Oberle underwent surgery at the nearby mediclinic nelspruit hospital thursday night and was in the intensive care unit friday, hospital spokeswoman robyn baard said. \"the doctors have said that the next 24 hours are absolutely the most critical time, \" said baard, who expected oberle's mother to arrive in south africa within a few days. Oberle, who was reportedly working as a guide, was with a group of tourists near an adult male chimpanzee enclosure when the mauling occurred, said david oosthuizen, executive director of the institute, in a statement. Witnesses said two male chimpanzees, called mickey and amadeus, grabbed oberle by his feet and pulled him under a perimeter fence and into their enclosure, then dragged him almost a half-mile, according to news reports. \"this is a terrible tragedy that should never happen, \" oosthuizen said. \"all our thoughts and prayers are with this"

        "summary": "\" sexual assault on an aircraft is a federal crime, \" the fbi warns in its new be air aware campaign — and it's a crime that the agency says has increased \" at an alarming rate \" in recent years. The bureau says there has been a steady rise in reported mid-air incidents, with the 38 investigations it opened in 2014 rising to 63 last year; the true number of incidents could be much higher, reports cnn. The fbi says it's not sure what's behind the increase, but it urges passengers to \" hit that call button \" and notify the flight crew immediately when there is an incident. Too often, passengers either fail to report the assault or only report it long after the flight, when it is harder to investigate and prosecute offenders, the bureau says. The fbi says sexual assault is more common on long-haul, overnight flights and often happens when a passenger is asleep. Brian nadeau, assistant special agent in charge of the baltimore division, tells the washington post that alcohol is often involved, and it is common for victims to be in either the middle or window seats. \" we find offenders will often test their victims, sometimes brushing up against them to see how they will react or if they will wake up, \" nadeau says. \" do not give these offenders the benefit of the doubt. \" ( this airline has created a service to help women flying alone. )",

Zev williams, an ob-gyn and director of the program for early and recurrent pregnancy loss at the einstein college of medicine of yeshiva university and montefiore medical center in new york. He set out to learn about the misconceptions that fill the silence, and in a survey of 1,084 adults published today in the journal obstetrics &amp; gynecology, he learned that most americans think miscarriage occurs in just 1 in 20 pregnancies — and men are 2.5 times more likely to think they're as rare as 1 in 50. In reality, 1 out of every 4 or 5 pregnancies actually end in miscarriage. \" i've taken care of sisters who didn't know that each of them were having recurrent miscarriages \" because they didn't tell each other, williams tells livescience. Another major myth is that women cause miscarriages ( e.g., via stress, lifting heavy objects, drinking, even having an argument or negative thoughts ), and 22 % of respondents believed lifestyle choices like drug use are the biggest cause. ( most miscarriages — 60 % — are caused by chromosomal abnormalities. ) guilt is a common reaction. \" i felt, and feel, literally broken, and betrayed by my body, \" one woman wrote to npr. \" it's irrational, but there is such a deep shame attached to not being able to carry a baby to term. \" among the survey respondents who've miscarried, nearly half said they felt less alone when friends talked about their own miscarriages.

Police say the body of 25-year-old thomas rolfes, who went to a bar with friends on friday night and was seen on surveillance video buying water at a gas station around 3: 30am, was found at 4: 30am, the new orleans advocate reports. He had been shot in the chest, and police say defensive wounds — and the fact that his wallet was missing — suggest he was the victim of a robbery, possibly as he tried to walk back to the hotel where he was staying with his fiancee. Police have no suspects, and rolfes ' family has pleaded for help finding the killer, reports the st. Louis post-dispatch. His father, ron rolfes, tells the times-picayune that his son fell in love with new orleans as a high school student, when they visited the city on a post-hurricane katrina volunteer trip. He decided to attend tulane university in the city, where he met his fiancee. They had planned to spend the weekend looking at possible wedding venues. \" right now it's just a horrible, horrible dream, \" the father says. \" we know it's reality, we're just trying to close the loop on that. \" rolfes was a 2012 campaign volunteer for mitt romney, who called the murder \" heartbreaking \" in a facebook post. \" a senseless and tragic loss, \" romney wrote. \" thomas was a highly valued member of our 2012 campaign team. His warm smile and engaging personality lifted our spirits. \"",

Some examples: ' big waste ': \" it sounds angelic, but it will probably end up being, mostly, a big waste, \" writes sam biddle at gawker. For one thing, the money is going to the zuckerbergs ' own foundation instead of, say, oxfam, and the broad goals of \" advancing human potential and promoting equality \" are mushy. \" does anyone really want to experience ' 100 times more than we do today, ' whatever that entails? \" asks biddle. \" do you want to be ' connected'to literally every ' idea ' and ' person ' in the world? this is a technocrat's dream and an actual normal human being's nightmare. \" it's emblematic of the code-fixes-all philosophy of silicon valley, \" and zuckerberg's massive giveaway will clearly be predicated on that conceit. \" here's the full piece, whose headline refers to zuckerberg's \" blinkered worldview. \" ' imperial roots ': this kind of giving perpetuates inequality and smacks of imperialism, writes devon maloney at the guardian. The \" rich are still effectively buying the future they'd like to see, no matter how selfless their intentions may be, \" she writes. \" international philanthropy and the western world's desire to eradicate poverty and disease can't ever truly rid themselves of their imperialist roots. \" maloney also cites the \" white savior industrial complex \" in the full piece. More on that: a writer at forbes pushes back hard against the guardian piece, calling it a \" misunderstanding of economics, \" while the washington post recalls a german billionaire's argument that having the rich, and not the state, decide what people need is a \" really bad \" idea. Not a charity: it's not exactly a slam, but alex kantrowitz points out at buzzfeed that the chan zuckerberg initiative is structured as an llc, not a charitable trust, as much coverage is suggesting. Meaning that not all of the money will go to charity; some will go into profit-generating private investment. ' guardedly optimistic ': not all the reaction is skeptical, of course.

The man and woman, both aged 26, were arrested at 20: 30 bst on tuesday after their flight landed at the airport. They were held on suspicion of travelling to syria in support of alleged terrorist activity. Police said their possible involvement in the abduction was a line of inquiry. British photographer john cantlie - who had done work for the sunday times - and dutch journalist jeroen oerlemans were taken hostage by islamist militants in syria for a week in july. After the ordeal, mr cantlie said one captor had claimed to be an nhs doctor. Scotland yard said the pair arrested at heathrow had flown into the uk from egypt. It confirmed both were of british nationality and had been arrested over allegations of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Joining jihadist groups officers from the metropolitan police's counter-terrorism command took the pair to a central london police station where they remain in custody. Two addresses in east london are being searched under the terrorism act in connection with police inquiries, the met said. Foreign secretary william hague, speaking to the bbc, said the uk government was aware of britons going to syria to fight. \" that's not something we recommend, and we do not want british people taking part in violent situations anywhere in the world, \" he said. Dozens of people are thought to have travelled from britain to syria to fight in the uprising against president bashar al-assad. The bbc's defence correspondent, frank gardner, said some of those are believed to have made such trips have joined jihadist groups. However, he said the syrian conflict had attracted relatively low numbers of britons travelling for jihadist reasons compared to previous wars in afghanistan and iraq. And there is no evidence that those leaving britain to fight in syria have any syrian family connections, our correspondent said. According to",

Yet those are among the beliefs plaguing people with cotard's syndrome, an illness discovered in 1880 that's extremely rare and awful when it strikes, medical daily reports. In case you doubt it, there are two studies ( here and here ) that found a.57 % and.62 % rate of cotard's, respectively, in large groups of psychiatric patients. Researchers say the condition — also known as \" walking corpse syndrome \" — often begins with severe depression and a health anxiety that can inspire odd complaints. One 28-year-old woman, for instance, told hospital staff that her stomach was missing and her liver was \" putrefying. \" the report on her case notes that the syndrome generally affects those in middle-age or later years, but when young people are diagnosed, they are overwhelmingly ( 90 % ) female. Over time, patients may believe they don't exist or lack body parts, which can trigger a slew of problems including poor hygiene, self-harm, and a refusal to eat. \" there was no point in eating because i was dead, \" a sufferer identified as graham told new scientist in 2013. He was the first cotard's patient to get a brain scan, and a neurologist likened the brain function the scan showed to \" that of someone during anesthesia or sleep. \" experts say antidepressants and antipsychotics can help, along with shock therapy, which may explain the low rate of cotard's today. Drugs and psychotherapy worked so well for graham that he was able to live on his own. \" i don't feel that brain-dead anymore, \" he says. \" things just feel a bit bizarre sometimes. \" ( see which us states have the most mental illness. )",

Those who knew bouhlel, who worked as a delivery driver, say he spent much of his time drinking and womanizing. The times reports that he set up a facebook page under the name javin bensucon at least four years ago and lived a double life as a salsa dancer under it, going to classes three times a week and regularly picking up women, some of them more than 20 years older than him. A former partner the times tracked down says he thought of himself as a \" stud \" and never spoke of his wife and three children. But although bouhlel has been described as a man previously indifferent to religion who was radicalized very quickly, prosecutors now say he had been plotting the attack for up to a year, suggesting he may have been following isis advice for followers to hide their religion and try to blend in while planning attacks, the ap notes.",

The now-shuttered arthur g. Dozier school for boys, in the panhandle town of marianna, has been accused of rapes, beatings, and forced labor, and both relatives and survivors have long thought some residents'deaths were suspicious. Forensic anthropologists with the university of south florida last year began exhuming graves in an effort to identify the boys, figure out how they died, and return their remains to their families for proper burials. All of the bodies, exhumed between september and december, appear to be those of children, cbs news reports; they were buried between the 1920s and 1950s, the ap adds. The florida department of law enforcement believed just 31 boys were buried in a cemetery on the grounds. But researchers could end up finding even more: burial locations weren't always recorded, and the bodies found so far were all on the african-american side of the segregated school, which operated from 1900 to 2011. Researchers think there may be more boys buried on the white side, and they ' ll start excavating there next week. So far, 12 families have come forward offering dna samples to compare to the remains, but researchers are still looking for relatives of more than 40 other boys.",

According to state records, 96 boys died while incarcerated at the dozier school for boys, formerly known as the florida state reform school and the florida industrial school for boys.

In august of 2013, florida officials voted to begin exhumations of the bodies at the now-shuttered school, and researchers from the university of south florida located and excavated the bodies from september through december. Now, a team of nearly 50 researchers from nine agencies are now working to identify those remains and determine causes of death, according to a usf press release.

        "summary": "China has declared that it's no longer accepting \" foreign garbage \" — which has left a lot of countries, including the us, wondering what to do with it. As part of a drive to reduce pollution, the country stopped accepting 24 kinds of waste on jan. 1, including mixed paper and the kinds of plastic used in bottles and bags, and brought in higher standards for other materials, the new york times reports. The policy was announced in july last year. Some chinese companies stopped accepting foreign waste months ago, but authorities in some countries were still unprepared for the change as this year began, meaning recyclable waste is being sent to landfills or stored in warehouses until officials can find a place to send it. China used to take around half the world's exports of recyclable paper, plastic, and metals. Countries including india, indonesia, and thailand are still accepting waste exports, but authorities say they don't have the capacity to replace china and there's a lot of competition among exporters, the cbc reports. Simon ellin, chief executive of britain's recycling association trade group, tells the times that dealing with the buildup of paper and plastic is causing \" tough times \" in the industry — but china's move will hopefully reduce the amount of trash being produced. \" what's happened is that the final link in the supply chain has turned around and said: ' no, we're not going to take this poor-quality stuff anymore. Keep it for yourself, ' \" he says. ( britain may introduce a \" latte levy \" to reduce waste. )",

            "A chinese ban on most foreign recycling material is leaving some canadian municipalities with stockpiles of papers and plastics, much of which may eventually end up in the dump. The ban is also driving down the revenues cities make off their recyclables because the competition to find a company able to take the materials is stiff. China used to be the main recipient of the world's recyclable plastics and papers but has now stopped accepting almost all foreign materials, leaving canadian cities in the lurch. Although the ban didn't take full effect until dec. 31, many chinese companies stopped accepting foreign recycling materials months ago, leaving some cities with stockpiles of flattened cardboard and crushed plastic without anywhere to send it. Matthew keliher, manager of solid waste for halifax, said three-quarters of his city's recyclables used to go to china. He said the city has found new markets for hard plastics and papers but film plastics — grocery bags and food storage bags and wraps — have proved harder to sell. Three hundred tonnes of film plastic amassed in a halifax warehouse since august is now being sent to the dump. Calgary, which used to send all of its paper recyclables and half of its plastics to china, has amassed 5,000 tonnes of material over the last few months that it can't find anyone else to take. It hasn't yet decided what to do with it. While canada has some domestic recycling companies, christina seidel, executive director of the recycling council of alberta, said those are almost exclusively for the high-grade plastics like milk jugs and juice bottles. \" that's a really high-quality material, \" she said. \" everyone wants those.

            "A chinese ban on most foreign recycling material is leaving some canadian municipalities with stockpiles of papers and plastics, much of which may eventually end up in the dump. The ban is also driving down the revenues cities make off their recyclables because the competition to find a company able to take the materials is stiff. China used to be the main recipient of the world's recyclable plastics and papers but has now stopped accepting almost all foreign materials, leaving canadian cities in the lurch. Although the ban didn't take full effect until dec. 31, many chinese companies stopped accepting foreign recycling materials months ago, leaving some cities with stockpiles of flattened cardboard and crushed plastic without anywhere to send it. Matthew keliher, manager of solid waste for halifax, said three-quarters of his city's recyclables used to go to china. He said the city has found new markets for hard plastics and papers but film plastics — grocery bags and food storage bags and wraps — have proved harder to sell. Three hundred tonnes of film plastic amassed in a halifax warehouse since august is now being sent to the dump. Calgary, which used to send all of its paper recyclables and half of its plastics to china, has amassed 5,000 tonnes of material over the last few months that it can't find anyone else to take. It hasn't yet decided what to do with it. While canada has some domestic recycling companies, christina seidel, executive director of the recycling council of alberta, said those are almost exclusively for the high-grade plastics like milk jugs and juice bottles. \" that's a really high-quality material, \" she said. \" everyone wants those. There aren't huge fans of the low grade plastics. \" sixty per cent of",

Most of the district's 2,600 or so teachers aren't taking this news sitting down — at least not behind their desks at their schools, thanks to a mass sickout monday urged by the detroit federation of teachers the day before. Ninety-four of the district's 97 schools were unable to open their doors monday to students ( 46,000 total in the district ), and hundreds of teachers called for an independent audit and the \" pay we have earned, \" as the executive vp of the union puts it, at a monday rally. About two-thirds of the district's teachers participate in a plan that distributes paychecks throughout the entire year, instead of just during the school year — and they say they were told there'd be enough money to cover their summer checks out of the $ 48.7 million the legislature directed to the district last month. Gov. Rick snyder, meanwhile, called the sickout \" not constructive \" on monday, per the ap, echoing sunday's sentiments from judge steven rhodes, the district's appointed emergency manager. Rhodes says although he understands the teachers ' \" frustration and anger, \" he also thinks the sickout was a \" drastic \" and \" unfortunate \" decision, as he's sure that lawmakers working on a $ 720 million bailout plan will come through, cnn reports. Strikes for teachers, cops, and other city workers are technically illegal in the state under the 1947 michigan public employment relations act, though the free press notes they happen anyway.",

The airline is planning to cut 125 workers after warning several hundred of them last year that it was time to get in shape, the bbc reports.

For the record, aviation regulations define normal body mass index as 18-25 for male cabin workers and 18-22 for females. But national union leader tapan sen says there's no strict weight requirement in the service rules for cabin workers, and a member of the all india cabin crew association says it's \" ridiculous \" to cut employees this way. \" any industry insider would vouch that air india flight attendants are the best, mainly because of their long experience, \" the member says. \" so, this guideline and the management's decision to follow it to the letter is unacceptable. \" just two years ago, air india said it could save about half a million dollars in overall costs annually by hiring female flight attendants, because their average weight is between 33 and 44 pounds less than a man's, the telegraph reported at the time.",

The results of a new study by the mayo clinic show that people did a better job of losing weight when they were paid to do so, reports science world report. The mayo clinic notes that while the finding isn't new, its study tracked more participants over a longer period of time ( 100 people over a year ). The subjects had a bmi of 30 to 39.9, putting them in the obese category. They were divided into incentive and no-incentive groups, then asked to lose four pounds a month — those in the incentive groups were paid $ 20 per month for meeting that goal; the \" incentived \" ones who didn't had to pay a $ 20 penalty. For people in the incentive groups, 62 % achieved the monthly goal, while only 26 % of participants in the incentive-free groups did. Overall, those in the incentive groups lost an average of 9.08 pounds, while the non-incentive groups ' average was 2.34 pounds. And even those who paid the penalty were more likely to stick with the study than those with no incentive. \" the take-home message is that sustained weight loss can be achieved by financial incentives, \" says the lead researcher. \" the financial incentives can improve results, and improve compliance and adherence. \"",

It's a byproduct of the war slowing down, but also reflects an effort to reduce civilian deaths, particularly at the hands of airstrikes. Findings, from the new york times and reuters: in 2012, the number of civilians killed was 2,754. That was down from 3,131 in 2011. But in that same time frame, the number injured rose from 4,507 to 4,805. The taliban or other insurgent groups were responsible for about 81 % of those casualties, a 9 % increase from 2011. Another 8 % of the casualties were caused by nato, afghan forces, and other pro-government forces, a drop of 46 % from the year prior. The remaining casualties could not be attributed to either side. Main causes of the deaths were ieds, which killed 868, and targeted killings, which resulted in 698 deaths — the latter is a 108 % increase over 2011. More women and girls were killed or hurt in 2012, with 864 making the list, a 20 % increase. More than 300 of those were deaths.",

But the paper notes that getting off scot-free could be tough: a conviction would make getting certain jobs ( with law enforcement, or working with children ) impossible, and even if they were to successfully argue they thought the couple was at least 18, they could be hit with a charge for sharing the video without consent.

The forum turned into a shouting match as six hillary clinton aides and six donald trump aides sitting across from each other clashed over issues including the alt-right, clinton's emails, and even who the real winner was. Abc news reports that clinton campaign manager robby mook riled the trump side by reminding them that clinton won the popular vote. \" hey guys, we won — there's no need to respond, \" trump campaign manager kellyanne conway told her fellow strategists. \" he was the better candidate — he won. \" the words \" we won \" were heard quite a few times during the discussion, politico notes. \" you guys are bitter, \" conway said after being accused of running a campaign where white supremacists had a platform. \" hashtag he's your president. How's that? will you ever accept the election results? \" the clinton team admitted some mistakes, but it largely blamed the loss on \" headwinds. \" in what the washington post describes as one of the trump team's strangest criticisms, former campaign manager corey lewandowski said the media had blundered by taking trump's words too literally.

        "summary": "Hiring downshifted last month as us employers added a modest 151,000 jobs, about half the blockbuster gains of the two previous months, the ap reports. The labor department said friday the unemployment rate remained 4.9 % for the third straight month. The figures are far below july's gain of 275,000 jobs, the most in eight months, and june's increase of 271,000. Still, they're enough to lower the jobless rate over time. Job gains slowed across most major industries, and employers cut workers in manufacturing, construction, and mining. The wall street journal notes that the labor force participation rate, at 62.8 %, was flat compared with july, and down a tick from last august's 62.9 %. The weaker pace may make it less likely that the federal reserve will raise short-term interest rates at its next meeting sept. 20-21.

The two sides are believed to be in early talks, and no decision has been made regarding the time slot ingraham might anchor, or even when she might join the company in the new role. No deal has been signed, and there is no sense at this time when one might come to fruition, this person said. She already serves as a fox news contributor.

Florida mom nicole gainey was arrested and charged with child neglect after allowing her 7-year-old son to walk half a mile to a park to play last saturday. Nbc 5 florida reports that the case is now expected to be dropped, but the mom was held on $ 4,000 bail after someone at a pool on the boy's route noticed he was alone and called the cops. There is no local law specifying at what age a child can roam alone; the cops have the authority to decide. \" honestly didn't think i was doing anything wrong, \" says gainey. \" i was letting him go play. \" but last year, an ohio father faced similar scrutiny after letting his 6-year-old daughter walk a few blocks to the post office alone, and just a few weeks ago a south carolina woman was arrested for letting her 9-year-old play at a park while she worked at mcdonald's. \" are we supposed to lock all our children inside for their safety at all times, and then we're negligent child abusers if we don't? \" lenore skenazy, the author of free range kids, asks the huffington post. The arresting officer, meanwhile, wrote in his report that \" numerous sex offenders reside in the vicinity \" of the park where gainey's son was found.

Ashleigh and bliss coulter of mountain springs mixed up that process in a history-making way: both moms carried the baby. Here's how: effortless reciprocal ivf. In layman's terms, the process allowed bliss to carry the embryo for five days as it formed, and that embryo was then transplanted into ashleigh, who carried the child, a son named stetson, to term. He was born in june. Abc news gets more technical, explaining that in effortless ivf, the egg and sperm are joined in something called an invocell capsule. That capsule is then inserted into a woman's vagina. As the coulters ' fertility doctor, dr. Kathy doody of the care fertility in bedford, explains, \" the woman has kidneys, a liver, and lungs, which allow the body [ to act ] as a natural incubator. \" typically, after the embryo is removed, it's ultimately implanted into the same woman. Kvue notes that by bypassing the use of a lab incubator, the couple cut the cost way down: their process runs about $ 8,000, versus $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 for reciprocal ivf with that incubator. Another same-sex couple in texas underwent the same procedure and had a girl in september. ( here's how to get pregnant at 50 without ivf. )",

About 200 baby montserrat tarantulas recently hatched at the zoo, marking the first time the rare spiders have been bred in captivity. Few have ever spotted the tarantulas in the wild on the caribbean island of montserrat, reports live science. But in 2013, zoo curator gerardo garcia captured some of the hairy brown spiders — which reach up to 8 inches across in adulthood and don't bite — and took them to the zoo to be bred. That proved easier said than done as researchers soon discovered the males mature quickly and live for only two and a half years, reports the bbc. Females live longer and mature more slowly, and can also see a male \" as a prey, rather than a partner, \" says garcia. \" there were a lot of sweaty moments. \" researchers witnessed courtship rituals in which a male drummed on a female's web, before three pregnant females vanished. \" they literally dig a burrow in the ground, \" says garcia. Several months later, \" spiders started popping out of the earth like crazy. From one single burrow, one female, we had about 200 tarantulas. \" the successful breeding \" is a huge achievement \" as little is known about the tarantulas, which are a food source for the caribbean's massive, yet critically endangered, mountain chicken frog, garcia adds in a statement.

The plea marks the end of an 11-year case, and marks the first time \" in a generation \" that a wall street firm has confessed to criminal conduct, the new york times reports. But prosecutors weren't able to lay a hand on the real apple of their eye, sac founder stephen a. Cohen. Sources tell the wall street journal that, barring new evidence, cohen will never be charged personally with a crime, and though sac will now be barred from managing money from outside investors, it will likely continue managing cohen's massive fortune — and hence continue to be a market force. Traders speculate that cohen, meanwhile, will simply found a new company to manage client money. Asked if they were disappointed, prosecutors defended the fines as \" very substantial. \" sac, meanwhile, released a statement decrying the \" handful \" of \" wrongdoers \" who had pleaded guilty.",

Three federal appeals court judges ruled unanimously friday that the law violated both the constitution and the voting rights act. Judge diana motz says north carolina lawmakers passed the new voting restrictions \" in the immediate aftermath of unprecedented african american voter participation in a state with a troubled racial history and racially polarized voting. \" according to the charlotte observer, north carolina voters will no longer be required to show a photo id when voting, and 16- and 17-year-olds can once again pre-register to vote. The ruling also brought back a week of early voting, the washington post reports. The aclu points out that all of the practices, including out-of-precinct voting, done away with by the 2013 law — and brought back by friday's ruling — are ones \" disproportionately used by african-americans. \" in 2014, the law kept 12,000 people from registering to vote on election day and tossed out 1,600 ballots mistakenly cast in the wrong precinct. Seventeen states moved to have stricter voting laws in the wake of high african-american voter turnout in 2012. Three of those laws — texas, wisconsin, and now north carolina — have been struck down this month.

        "summary": "Wally the dead whale has apparently been washing up on beaches in southern california a lot more reliably than the swallows now return to capistrano. The body of a dead humpback whale that turned up in encinitas, northern san diego county, is believed to be the same whale that has already been towed out to sea at least five times after washing up on beaches in los angeles and orange counties, abc7 reports. Last week, the los angeles times reported that the 22-ton female carcass, which first turned up on dockweiler state beach june 30, appeared to be staying away from the beach it hit next — newport beach — after being towed out to sea several times. Wally keeps coming back because officials haven't towed her far enough out to sea to avoid winds and currents bringing the 45-foot carcass back to shore, the daily breeze reports. Time and vessel size constraints mean wally has been towed out around 15 miles each time when 30 miles would be more appropriate, experts say. But the saga may soon be over: the san diego union-tribune reports that officials in encinitas plan to cut up the decaying whale — which can now be smelled at least a quarter of a mile away — and dump it in a landfill. A construction crew tried to get rid of wally on sunday, but they gave up after part of a forklift snapped and will resume the effort on monday, officials say.

            "« that uganda beheading story &#124; main &#124; not even civil unions » from mercede johnston's blog: the message was from my mother saying that levi, who has not spoken to us since he rekindled his relationship with bristol ( although we had attempted repeatedly to call or text him ), left a message saying that if i did not take my blog down by wednesday that i would never get to see him, or tripp, again. I could not believe it! i thought to myself if he was really willing to make such a threat that he would at least have the decency to call me and talk about it first. I mentioned on my blog repeatedly that my intention was not to hurt or attack the palins, but to speak out and tell the public my side of the story. As well as how badly my life, and the lives of our family members, had been impacted by our association with the palins. It had my mind spinning. How could my brother threaten me like this? that's a very good question. So is the question of how palin finally put the screws on levi. In palinland, no one knows what's really going on. But i wonder if this is a somewhat panicked response to the recent blip upwards in web interest in the trig question. With all these family members able to speak to the public and mcginniss digging deeper, todd and sarah may have felt the need to crack down and use levi's access to tripp and bristol as their latest weapon. Mercede has this to say about levi's latest statement, which reads like a man who has a metaphorical gun to his head: as for this new people magazine article where my brother \"apologizes to the palins \" i am extremely disappointed in him. Not only is he being controlled like a puppet, but saying that all of his comments and stories were lies is absurd! i know for a fact that all of his comments were true. I lived through all this and i remember clear as day all of the times that levi would come home and tell me about sarah complaining, or fights going on between the family,.etc. I know"

Evgeniy mikhailovich bogachev, whose online aliases include \" lucky12345″ and \" slavic, \" is accused of running what the fbi calls a \" tightly knit gang of cybercriminals \" that created a botnet called \" gameover zeus, \" ars technica reports.

The previous biggest reward for a cybercriminal was the $ 1 million offered for romanian ebay scammer nicolae popescu, reports vocativ. Bogachev and his gang were also behind the \" cryptolocker \" ransomware that held files on a user's computer hostage until they paid up, authorities say. \" although we were able to significantly disrupt the gameover zeus and cryptolocker criminal enterprise, we have not yet brought bogachev himself to justice, \" a justice department spokeswoman says.

After years of turning a blind eye to the trade that rakes in billions of dollars a year — almost half the country's gdp — hundreds of police officers backed by armored vehicles have been deployed to the pot-farming village of lazarat and are battling villagers armed with rpgs, mortars, and machine guns, the ap reports. The government says it is now in control of around half the village and has burned 11 tons of marijuana, a small fraction of the 900 tons the village is believed to produce every year. The crackdown, which has only injured one police officer and three villagers despite the heavy gunfire, is part of the new socialist government's attempt to stamp out the trade and boost its bid to join the european union, the bbc reports. At bloomberg, leonid bershidsky says he has a better idea. \" brussels should consider legalizing marijuana throughout the eu, \" he writes. \" then albania, with its well-developed cannabis industry, could be welcomed to the union as a country with a legitimate, honorable specialization. \"",

Today it's cbs making that call with cbs all access, an on-demand service that offers streaming of current and past seasons of popular cbs shows, as well as classic shows, for $ 5.99 a month, tvline.com reports. According to a cbs press release, the service offers new episodes of 15 current prime-time shows the day after they air; live-streaming of local cbs stations in 14 markets ( with more to be added ); full past seasons of favorites like survivor and the good wife; \" cbs classics \" like twin peaks and cheers; and the ability to live-stream big brother around the clock. The service is meant to attract the demographic that uses netflix, the new york times notes — those the times calls \" cord nevers \" ( people who've never paid for tv packages ) and \" cord cutters \" ( those who've nixed their cable or satellite subs ). The idea isn't making everyone reach for the remote. First, you won't find nfl games on the service, though cbs execs are pushing other sports that are available for live-streaming and reportedly talking to the nfl about future possibilities. Kate knibbs comes down harshly on the plan, writing at gizmodo that this \" is possibly the worst streaming tv deal out there, \" noting the fact that viewers have to sit through ads for current shows, just like on regular tv ( the classic shows are ad-free ), and that — unlike hbo — you can watch cbs for free already. Times tech writer farhad manjoo agrees, tweeting, \" offering to let you pay $ 5.99 a month for shows you can get for free is just why tv has done so well in the digital age. \" if you want it anyway, the service is available at cbs.com or through mobile devices via the cbs app.",

        "summary": "Poker-faced celebs like victoria beckham may have figured this out already: smiling makes you look older. A new study out of canada claims that contrary to the popular belief that a happy grin is a sign of \" positive values and youth, \" researchers found that flashing those pearly whites can add a year or two onto your apparent age, the new york daily news reports. The study by brain and mind institute at the university of western ontario involved showing participants images of people with various expressions: smiling, neutral, and surprised. When asked to rate each expression youngest to oldest, the faces showing surprise were deemed the youngest; a wide-eyed look of wonder can shave years off your apparent age. But when we smile, crinkly wrinkles appear around the eyes that participants took as a sign of age. A surprised expression, on the other hand, pulls the skin back and had the effect of erasing signs of age. Interestingly, when asked later about their perceptions, participants in the study published in the journal psychonomic bulletin and review incorrectly recalled that they had tagged the smiling faces as the youngest. \"they were completely blind to the fact they had 'aged'the happy-looking faces, \" co-author melvyn goodale says in a news release. \" their perceptions and their beliefs were polar opposites. \" so what's the takeaway? to goodale the study reveals that while \" it may seem counterintuitive … people can sincerely believe one thing and then behave in a completely different way. \" ( simone biles had this to say when told she should smile. )",
