The ap has the death toll in the immediate aftermath at \" several people, \" but it's expected to rise given the number of casualties being brought to local hospitals.

Witnesses in damaturu, in yobe state, say a suicide bomber in a tricycle taxi detonated explosives as people watched brazil's match against mexico on tv. At least 27 people are said to have been seriously injured. Public screenings of the world cup in some parts of nigeria have been banned because of threats by boko haram. Three states, including yobe, are under a government-imposed state of emergency following years of attacks. No group has said it was behind the latest blast.

While some say they will now stay away from viewing centres because they are scared, others say they will still go, but with caution. Many say they enjoy going to the centres too much to stop. As well as watching the games with their friends, they enjoy arguing, analyzing and betting on the matches. Others say that after the bombing, they will stay away as they do not want to lose their lives for the sake of watching a football game. Lynda, a student and a football fan says: \" during the champions league final between atletico and real madrid, i was in a viewing centre when i heard that another one was bombed in jos.

Boko haram islamic extremists have targeted football viewing centers and sports bars in recent weeks, killing at least 40 people in two blasts in northern cities.

It's not a plight to be taken lightly, as the intercept makes clear with this example: a lawsuit filed by journalist marie colvin's family claims syrian military intelligence used signal interception technology to trace her via her phone and bomb her makeshift media center, killing her. Whistleblower edward snowden, who says he hasn't been able to use a smartphone since leaking those nsa docs in 2013, intends to alter that paradigm. On thursday he presented research via teleconference from an undisclosed location in russia on what the boston globe has dubbed a \" smartphone spy catcher. \" as the intercept explains, a phone's cellular, bluetooth, wifi, and gps radios can betray a user, and the easiest way to shut down those radios — switch to airplane mode — can be rendered useless, without the user's knowledge, by malware. Snowden's partner, hardware hacker andrew \" bunnie \" huang, says it's best to always \" assume the phone is compromised, \" reports wired, and their goal is to create a device that reveals whether this is the case. Though they say a prototype ( for the iphone 6 ) is at least a year away, their so-called \" introspection engine \" will be a tiny open-source computer that looks like an external battery, affixes to a smartphone, and displays radio statuses on a screen. If a status is compromised, the pair suggest an alarm could sound; the device could potentially even then activate a \" kill switch. \"",

Cash-strapped nasa hasn't shown much interest in investing money in the idea, hence the move toward crowdfunding to get the job done. The plan revolves around a satellite launched by nasa in 1978 called the international sun-earth explorer, or isee-3. It was supposed to permanently hang out in the orbit between the sun and earth to monitor solar wind, but another team at nasa sort of hijacked the satellite five years later to go comet-hunting. While isee-3 did great in its new duty, it had to leave its old orbit to do so and has been looping around the sun ever since. But the spacecraft makes a swing by earth in august, raising the opportunity for its reboot — assuming all the technical logistics can be addressed. \" in order to interact with the spacecraft we will need to locate the original commands and then develop a software recreation of the original hardware that was used to communicate with the spacecraft, \" explains that crowdfunding plea at rockethub. A blog post at planetary.org lays out the difficulties. Still, it's worth a shot, concludes ben richmond at motherboard. \" given nasa's success rate at using spacecraft beyond their mission — the voyagers, kepler, etc — why not try to wake up the isee-3 and see what it's got left? \"",

Not only were the frequent users 66 % less likely to be troubled with any form of dementia, they were 65 % less likely to be diagnosed with alzheimer's disease. Average temperatures in the sauna hovered around 174 degrees fahrenheit.

Eggs are a major source of cholesterol, which has been associated with elevated blood glucose and an increased risk of t2d. However, there are limited and conflicting data from prospective population studies on the association between egg consumption and risk of t2d. Objective: we investigated the association between egg consumption and risk of incident t2d in middle-aged and older men from eastern finland. Design: the study included 2332 men aged 42 – 60 y in 1984 – 1989 at the baseline examinations of the prospective, population-based kuopio ischemic heart disease risk factor study. Dietary intakes were assessed with 4-d food records at baseline. Incident t2d was assessed by self-administered questionnaires; by fasting and 2-h oral-glucose-tolerance-test blood glucose measurement at re-examination rounds 4, 11, and 20 y after baseline; and by record linkage to a hospital discharge registry and reimbursement register of diabetes medication expenses. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate associations with the risk of incident t2d. Associations with the metabolic risk markers at baseline and at the 4-y examinations were analyzed by ancova. Results: during an average follow-up of 19.3 y, 432 men developed t2d.

Police received a report of a 911 call in which a child could be heard babbling on the other end of the line. But when deputy martha lohnes arrived at the home to investigate, 2-year-old aaliyah came \" running out to the front with half a pant leg on and she's just like, ' hey, ' \" lohnes tells wspa. The girl had apparently called because she needed help getting dressed. So lohnes helped her out. \" then it was almost like a reward, she just wanted a hug. \" \" then she wouldn't let any of the police leave because she wanted hugs, \" adds mom pebbles ryan, who received a call about the incident while at work. Pebbles says she had shown aaliyah how to call 911 in an emergency but had never expected she'd call about a fashion emergency. The little girl, who was in the care of her grandfather, had made the call without his knowledge, leaving him \" completely bewildered, \" reports the washington post.

The 65-foot, 55-ton ship was discovered in 2012 during efforts to widen the flow of the ijssel river. It is a ship known as a cog, which were used for international trade voyages in the late medieval period, per live science. While the vessel was stripped down before it was sunk, researchers did find a brick oven and glazed tiles in its galley. A barge and punt ( a small boat ) of the same period also were found on the riverbed. Researchers believe the watercraft were sunk purposely to divert the flow of the river and improve sea traffic. Now, the ship will be transported to a preservation facility in leylstad, where it may take as long as three years to dry out. The hope is to eventually put the ship in a museum. But there is a possibility that the drying process won't work, in which case, live science notes, it will be studied then destroyed.

France's new socialist president, françois hollande, is lowering the minimum retirement age by two years, reports the telegraph. Those who begin work at the age of 18 and pay enough into the pension system can now retire with benefits at the age of 60. The move fulfills a campaign promise, and reverses the work of nicolas sarkozy, who raised the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62, sparking a storm of national protests. Hollande cited \" social justice \" as the reason for the move, which runs counter to austerity measures being taken by much of europe. Hollande announced the change just as unemployment in france hit 10 % for the first quarter — the highest in 12 years. The expected $ 1.37 billion cost of extra pensions is to be covered by more payroll fees for employers and workers. The leftist cgt union hailed the move, which will take effect in november, as a \" striking decision that breaks with policies everywhere in europe. \" the leading business lobby blasted it as \" worrying for the financial future of the pension systems and for the competitiveness of businesses. \" france used to have one of the highest retirement ages in europe — 65.

            "France's new socialist government moved wednesday to lower the retirement age from 62 to 60 years old for certain workers, bucking a global trend in a gesture to unions that critics say is a costly mistake. Governments from north america to europe have been pushing retirement ages higher and higher in recent decades, as people live longer and spend more years on state-sponsored pension checks. New french president francois hollande, who won election last month on a wave of voter anger at austerity measures, proved wednesday that his leftist campaign rhetoric was not just bluster. Raising france's legal retirement age was one of conservative former president nicolas sarkozy's key reforms, aimed at reducing heavy government debts as europe sunk into a continent-wide financial crisis. The reform met huge, nationwide protests _ yet many economists said it didn't push the retirement age high enough. The minimum retirement age went from 60 to 62, and the age to receive a full pension regardless of how many years you pay into the system went from 65 to 67. On wednesday, hollande's government presented a draft decree at a cabinet meeting that reverses the retirement age to 60 for those who enter the workforce at 18 or 19 years old and have contributed long enough to the pension system. The right to retire at 60 was seen as a pillar of france's social benefit system for decades. The government said the decree, affecting about one in six retiring workers, will be finalized later this month and take effect in november. The decree also slightly eases pension requirements for mothers, noting \" the impact of motherhood on women's careers, \" and for people who suffer workplace accidents. The hard-left cgt union hailed the move as a \" striking decision that breaks with policies everywhere in europe. \" the government says the costs _ estimated",

If snorted, injected, eaten, or smoked, the drug can boost body temperature and cause a heart attack, kidney damage, or kidney failure. But that's nothing compared to what it does to your brain. The drug throws dopamine and serotonin — the neurotransmitters that regulate mood — out of whack, leading to hallucinations, hyperstimulation, aggression, and paranoia. The paranoia can last for months, though the high from flakka lasts only a few hours, reports fox 25. Cannibalism and increased strength have also been reported in several cases; police say austin harrouff was found chewing on the face of one of his alleged murder victims on monday, and it took a stun gun, a police dog, and several officers to detain him.

What is flakka? alpha-pvp, or flakka, is a synthetic stimulant that is, chemically, similar to amphetamines. It has also been compared to a combination of methamphetamines and crack cocaine. It is similar to \"bath salts, \" another so-called designer drug that gives users extreme highs.

Police believe austin harrouff was under the influence of the synthetic stimulant during the killings, so let's learn five things to know about flakka. 1.flakka has many adverse side affects. The designer drug drives individuals into a state of excited delirium, which can involve hyperstimulation, paranoia, and hallucinations. The worst and most extreme side effects are severe aggressiveness and even cannibalism, as in several murders where the user was under the influence of the drug, they began eating the flesh of their victims. In austin's case, he was chewing on the face of john stevens, 59, when the murders were discovered. 2. Flakka causes those who take it to become abnormally strong. The synthetic stimulant causes those who take it to gain great levels of physical strength. In austin's case, four police officers tried to pull him off one of his victims but were unable to. They eventually had to use a stun gun and a k-9 unit to end his deadly spree. 3. Flakka has several other nicknames throughout the country.

What is flakka? alpha-pvp, or flakka, is a synthetic stimulant that is, chemically, similar to amphetamines. It has also been compared to a combination of methamphetamines and crack cocaine. It is similar to \"bath salts, \" another so-called designer drug that gives users extreme highs.

In austin's case, he was chewing on the face of john stevens, 59, when the murders were discovered. 2. Flakka causes those who take it to become abnormally strong. The synthetic stimulant causes those who take it to gain great levels of physical strength. In austin's case, four police officers tried to pull him off one of his victims but were unable to. They eventually had to use a stun gun and a k-9 unit to end his deadly spree. 3. Flakka has several other nicknames throughout the country. The drug is also known as \"gravel \" because it appears to resemble pink and white"

The actor ( wearing his top gun: maverick gear ) filmed a psa with director chris mcquarrie about a feature of high-definition tvs called video interpolation or motion smoothing. It's meant to reduce motion blur when you're watching sports, but if you're watching a movie, it makes everything look... Weird. \" many people can't quite put their finger on why the movie they're watching looks strange, \" mcquarrie says in the video; people often refer to it as \" the soap opera effect. \" ars technica explains it thusly: \" your hollywood blockbuster movie will look like a 1970s bbc tv series. \" ( the site has a great explainer if you want the nitty-gritty on how it works. ) cruise's plea: to make sure you're watching a movie the way the filmmaker intended, turn the setting off. The problem? most high-def tvs come with the feature automatically turned on, and it can take a series of complicated steps to turn it off. Directors called out the same setting last year, with one noting a common series of steps: \" menu>picture>advanced controls>reality augmentation>motion liquidity>fluid frame restoration. \" cruise and mcquarrie's recommendation? just search online for \" turn off motion smoothing [ your brand of tv here ] \" and then follow the steps. People are loving the psa: \" you're doing god's work, tom cruise, \" reads one sample tweet. And at hot air, allahpundit writes, \" this is simultaneously the most trivial, and most useful, psa to come out of hollywood in decades. \"",

        "summary": "The massive ransomware attack still reverberating around the world is the kind of thing that is going to keep happening unless rules like those governing conventional warfare are brought in for cyberspace, microsoft says. Microsoft president brad smith warned in a blog post sunday that the \" stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments \" has once again caused enormous damage, usa today reports. Smith says the \" wannacrypt \" attack, also known as \" wannacry, \" was created with data stolen from the nsa, which had used a vulnerability it found to create cyberweapons. The equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the \" us military having some of its tomahawk missiles stolen, \" smith said. \" the governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call, \" smith wrote, repeating the company's call for a digital geneva convention. Microsoft issued a patch after the theft was discovered in march, but it was not issued to people and organizations using older versions of its system. More than 200,000 computers in 150 countries have been affected and the ap reports that there were thousands more cases early monday as people got back to work after the weekend and booted up infected computers. The ransomware is demanding $ 300 to unlock user's files. The bbc says its analysis of accounts linked to the attack found that around $ 38,000 had been paid by early monday.",

        "summary": "Murder charges have been filed in a police shooting that sparked angry demonstrations in albuquerque, nm, last year. Former albuquerque police detective keith sandy and swat team member dominique perez have been charged in the death of 38-year-old james boyd, a mentally ill homeless man who was fatally shot after an hourslong standoff in the city's foothills last march, reports the albuquerque journal. Helmet camera video is expected to play a major role in the case. Video from an officer's camera appears to show boyd, who was suspected of illegal camping, trying to surrender, but police say he was \" unpredictably and dangerously close to a defenseless officer while he was wielding two knives, \" the ap reports. The district attorney says she decided to file charges via a process called criminal information instead of going to a grand jury because she wanted \" total transparency \" in the case, reports the new york times. \" unlike ferguson and new york city, people will see the evidence and hear the witnesses, \" she says. The murder charges are open, giving prosecutors the option of pursuing manslaughter or first- or second-degree murder charges if a judge decides there's enough evidence. The president of new mexico's fraternal order of police says the charges are part of a national trend to distrust police and \" it is time to stop second-guessing police officers, \" although a federal probe that began before the boyd shooting found that albuquerque police had a pattern of using \" excessive and deadly force. \"",

        "summary": "The answer to the question \" who betrayed anne frank \" may be \" nobody, \" according to new research. A study released by the anne frank house museum in amsterdam says that the hiding place of the jewish teenager and her family may instead have been found by chance when nazi security forces raided the building to investigate fraudulent food-ration cards or illegal employment, the bbc reports. The study, which counts police documents and anne's famous diary among its sources, found that the german \" sicherheitsdienst \" police that discovered the family usually investigated cases involving cash and securities, not hidden jews, and they spent much longer at the amsterdam building during the aug. 4, 1944, raid than usually happened in cases like the arrest of the frank family. \" during their day-to-day activities, investigators from this department often came across jews in hiding by chance, \" according to the study, which notes that there is no evidence that an anonymous phone call long thought to have betrayed the family actually happened. The study notes that two men who worked in the building were arrested earlier in 1944 for dealing in illegal ration cards, and anne wrote about the arrest in her diary, the ap reports. There is also evidence that the german occupiers had been investigating people working at the address when they should have been sent for forced labor elsewhere. It is still possible that anne, who died in the bergen-belsen camp in 1945, was betrayed, but the study \" illustrates that other scenarios should also be considered, \" says ronald leopold, the museum's director.

At issue is prince andrew, his ties to american billionaire/registered sex offender jeffrey epstein, and whether queen elizabeth's second son had sex with an underage girl named as \" jane doe number 3 \" in a lawsuit filed last week in florida. The woman, who is being named by the daily mail, claims that epstein forced her to have sex with men including the duke of york in london, new york, and on epstein's private caribbean island between 1999 and 2002, beginning when she was just 17. Also named is harvard law prof alan dershowitz, who yesterday \" categorically and unequivocally \" denied all allegations. \" this relates to longstanding and ongoing civil proceedings in the united states, to which the duke of york is not a party, \" said the palace statement. \" as such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue. \" andrew himself is cutting short a ski vacation to return and address the allegations, reports the daily mail, which notes that the royal may have immunity from prosecution stemming from epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution. Andrew resigned as uk trade envoy in 2011 over his ties to epstein.",

            "Federal prosecutors initially threatened to bring him to trial on a variety of charges and seek the maximum penalty, 10 years in prison. After years of legal wrangling, mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to lesser state charges. Upon his release from jail, he must register as a sex offender wherever he goes in the united states. People from all walks of life break the law, of course. But for the rich, wrapped in a cocoon of immense comfort, it can be easy to yield to temptation, experts say. \"a sense of entitlement sets in, \" said dennis pearne, a psychologist who counsels people on matters related to extreme wealth. The attitude, he said, becomes, \"i deserve anything i want, i can have anything i want — and i can afford it. \" to prosecutors, mr. Epstein is just another sex offender. He did what he did because he could, and because he never dreamed he would get caught, they say. Mr. Epstein's defenders counter that he has been unjustly persecuted because of his wealth and lofty connections. Sitting on his patio on \"little st. Jeff's \" in the virgin islands several months ago, as his legal troubles deepened, mr. Epstein gazed at the azure sea and the lush hills of st. Thomas in the distance, poked at a lunch",

When she heard about derby's condition, she knew she had to do her part to give him a second chance — and perhaps find a solution to his mobility limitations. After taking derby in as a foster, anderson set him up with a wheeled cart to make it easier for him to get around. And while it certainly did help, anderson suspected that her team of designers could do one better. The skilled staff at 3d systems soon set about crafting a custom set of prosthetic legs that would not only help derby to move more naturally, but that would also let him live out his full potential as an energetic pet. Several design attempts later, they finally settled on an oval-tread shape, designed to fit derby's unique anatomy. But even before getting that special gift made just for him, derby found something even more important — a forever home with a new family who loves him, differences and all. To derby's adopted parents, the portanovas, he was just an all-around happy dog, though he was soon about to get a whole lot happier. The day came recently for derby to try on the prosthetic limbs, and for the very first time in his life, experience the joy of running. \" it was incredible and emotional the first time we saw him run on his new legs, \" sherry says. \" incredible because it was his very first time on them and emotional because he was so excited to be running. \" since then, derby has barely slowed down, using"

Relatively speaking, anyway: pyongyang launched two intermediate-range musudan missiles in the direction of japan on wednesday, reports the bbc. The first one flopped almost immediately, just like four previous launches. But the second one reached an altitude of about 620 miles before plunging into the sea, raising concern in both south korea and japan, reports reuters. The missile also covered about 250 miles, getting more than halfway to japan's coast. The bbc notes the missile's range is much further; it's unclear whether it fell short due to failure or was intentionally kept from reaching japan. \" this is a very important milestone because the previous launches had blown up either very shortly after launch or possibly even right at launch, \" an analyst at the middlebury institute of international studies in california tells the voice of america. \" so this is a real sign of progress. \" japan's defense chief put it more succinctly: \" the threat to japan is intensifying. \" south korea and the us are still assessing the test, but south korean president park geun-hye denounced the \" reckless provocation. \" un resolutions forbid the north from working on ballistic missile technology, notes the bbc, but the launches suggest that pyongyang is having little trouble obtaining the technology and the know-how.",

But butler intercepted a russell wilson pass on the goal line to snatch the game away. Seattle had grabbed a 10-point lead early in the second half with a field goal and a wilson td pass to wide receiver doug baldwin. ( weird side note: baldwin incurred a 15-yard penalty for pretending to defecate the football after scoring, yahoo sports reports. ) new england fired back with two tom brady td passes, to wide receivers danny amendola and julian edelman. The first half was more of a see-saw battle. The pats struck first with a brady pass to slanting wide receiver brandon lafell. Seattle's initially anemic offense then came to life with a strong drive and a marshawn lynch rushing td. The pats returned fire with a 22-yard brady pass to rob gronkowski. The seahawks ended the first half by boldly foregoing a field-goal attempt in the red zone with less than 10 seconds on the clock. Russell wilson connected with wide receiver chris matthews to even the game at 14-14 going into the locker room. It was a \" much better game than last year, \" according to one comment on espn's live super bowl blog.",

On feb. 5, just two days after he allegedly killed his first two victims, fishermen at san diego's driscoll wharf say he approached them and tried to find someone who would take him fishing in mexico. He offered $ 200 to $ 400 but found no takers, even after he came back to the pier with fish tacos to sweeten the deal. The fishermen remembered him being kind, and talking about a \" friend \" who had been fired and was having problems with the police. He tried again on feb. 6, to no avail; that same day, someone matching his description tried to steal a boat from a san diego marina and failed, tying up an 81-year-old man on the boat in the process. That night, dorner's description was released, and the fishermen he spoke to notified authorities. Another new tidbit from the ensuing manhunt: turns out dorner didn't have to exert much effort in order to find the big bear hiding spot where he ended up. He just found an unlocked cabin and walked right in, locking the door behind him. He stayed hidden for days, though the cabin was just 100 feet away from the police command post, until its owners came to clean it and stumbled upon him. Police had knocked on the door when the big bear search began, the ap reports, but upon finding it locked with no sign of a break-in, they moved on.",

The tianjin airlines plane had just taken off from hotan and was bound for urumqi when the incident occurred.

A spokeswoman for the xinjiang regional government said the hijackers were men from the uighur minority group. Hou hanmin told the bbc that the group tried to break into the cockpit using a broken crutch as a weapon but were overpowered by passengers and crew. At least seven passengers and crew were injured, she said. No details were available on the alleged hijackers ' motives or identities, she added, and police were \" still investigating \" whether they had any other weapons. Almost half of xinjiang's residents are uighurs, a muslim minority group with cultural and ethnic links to central asia. Uighur allegations of discrimination and marginalisation have been behind anti-han chinese and separatist sentiment in the restive region since the 1990s.

The attempt was made just after the plane took off from hotan in southern xinjiang for the regional capital of urumqi and the six suspects were detained after the plane returned safely, the tianshan regional government's news portal said. Tianjin airlines said on its website that the plane returned to hotan 22 minutes after takeoff. Tianshan's report did not give further details, such as how the hijacking was foiled, how many passengers were on the plane or what was known about the suspects ' motive or ethnicity. Hotan has been the scene of recent clashes between ethnic uighurs ( pronounced wee ' -gurs ) and authorities. The uighurs say they resent government controls on their religion and culture. The government says china faces an organized terrorist threat from radical muslim groups in the region and that it has invested heavily to raise living standards in xinjiang. The phone listed for hotan police rang unanswered friday. A man who identified himself as a police officer and gave only his family name wang at xinjiang department of public security said no more information on the hijacking attempt was available.

The group estimated there were 22 veteran suicides per day in 2010, but had never taken an official count, reports usa today. The decline from the 2010 estimate is nothing to celebrate, according to david shulkin, va's undersecretary for health, who says the most recent number is \" still far too high. \" veterans accounted for 18 % of all suicides in the us in 2014, though they made up just 8.5 % of the population. About 65 % of the veterans were 50 or older and 70 % were not regular recipients of va services, reports the military times. Among male veterans aged 18 to 29, the suicide rate was 86 per 100,000 people; the us suicide rate as a whole is 13 per 100,000. The rate for female veterans aged 18 to 29 was 33 per 100,000. Suicide rates among american females jumped 40 % from 2001 to 2014 but 85 % among female veterans. \" it is difficult to understand why that is happening. It is one of the things that i think will become a central research question for us, \" says shulkin, who hopes to discover whether sexual trauma or combat service increases a woman's suicide risk. The va says it is \" aggressively \" tackling the suicide issue, including by offering same-day service to veterans with urgent mental health needs, per abc news.

        "summary": "Facebook unveiled its new search tool today even as stats showed that the number of americans using the site fell by 1.4 million in december, reports marketwatch. A blip, or did the us hit a saturation point? maybe it's those new ads and fees? time will tell, but it's a safe bet that mark zuckerberg hopes his new \" graph search \" — lots of reviewers hate the abstract name — will reverse the trend by embedding facebook further into our lives. The tech press generally seems intrigued, with many taking a wait-and-see approach in reviews. Andrew leonard at salon says it \" looks like a big deal, \" with the potential to change the business models of online dating, job searches, and the like. Yelp, craigslist, and, of course, google, are surely taking notice. Here's his example of a potential use: \" it's saturday night in the not too distant future. You walk into a crowded bar. At first glance, you don't recognize anyone, so you pull out your phone and log into your facebook app. You tap in a query: show me the single women ( or men ) who are in this bar, adore mozart, macklemore and the tv show community and are part of the network defined as ' friends of my facebook friends. '... If you're lucky, facebook spits back a few profile pics at you, and you're suddenly ready to buy someone a drink who is already pre-approved for your personal checklist. \" full post here. Of course, none of this works unless you and your friends, and their friends, are diligent \" likers. \" sure, you can theoretically find a dentist recommended by this circle, but how many people \" like \" their dentist right now? \" consider me, \" writes danny sullivan at searchengineland. \" not only have i not liked my electrician, my plumber, my dentist, my doctor or my tax person on facebook but i don't even know if they have facebook pages. I have nothing to offer to my facebook friends in this regard. \" facebook understands the challenge, he adds, \" but it's hoping the promise of what search can provide will help encourage people to build the connections they may lack now. \" full post here.",

Lebanese president michel aoun on saturday asked saudi arabia to explain hariri's absence from lebanon. \" the obscurity regarding hariri's conditions makes anything that he says or does not reflect truth, \" aoun said. Saudi arabia has claimed to be protecting hariri from an assassination attempt. The times calls the situation \" one in a profusion of bewildering events...

However, a separate analysis from the panel's conservative members blames a \" tragic failure of leadership, \" per cnn. The panel says it was \" shameful \" of clinton to turn her emails over to the state department, which decided what to release, rather than to the committee itself, per politico. It adds that state and defense officials \" consistently refused to answer questions \" relating to reports that president obama approved an operation to arm the libyan opposition ahead of the attack, reports politico. In their own report on monday, democrats say the report is \" a conspiracy theory on steroids bringing back long-debunked allegations with no credible evidence whatsoever \" in an attempt to hurt clinton's presidential bid, per the ap.

Think every airport security or bank line you've ever been in, then multiply by a factor of 10 or so. \" visiting an inmate there is a lesson in both human behavior and the art of learning patience, \" writes slepian at nbcnews.com. He has visited dozens of prisons to interview prisoners, but rikers is in a category of its own, it seems. First, you park in a lot by a bridge that connects queens to rikers and wait for the bus. That bus takes you to the first stop, the registration building, where the lines to get in are long even at 7am. After an id check, you ' ll eventually pass through airport-like security and x-rays, get questioned, fill out some forms, then get shuttled to a waiting center near the housing units. After another long wait comes another shuttle ride to the actual detention facility, along with another round of metal-detectors and x-ray machines. Then comes another security check in a private vestibule where you have to lift your tongue and fold down your waistband to prove you're not bringing stuff in. Then it's another wait of about half an hour before the actual visit. Maintaining security at a prison as huge as rikers — figure about 10,000 prisoners on any given day — is of course a time-consuming challenge.

History, whites of european ancestry account for less than half of newborn children, marking a demographic tipping point that is already changing the nation's politics, economy and workforce. Among the roughly four million children born in the u.s. Between july 2010 and july 2011, 50.4 % belonged to a racial or ethnic group that in previous generations would have classified them as minorities, up from 48.6 % in the same period two years earlier, the census bureau said thursday. That was the first 12-month stretch in which non-hispanic white children accounted for less than half the country's births. The 2008 election of barack obama as america's first black president was in some ways emblematic of the nation's changing face. But as the population evolves toward a more-varied mix that includes fast-growing asian and hispanic populations, the black/white divide that characterized the civil-rights movement has itself become a relic. William h. Frey, a demographer at the brookings institution, says african-americans are the largest minority among adults over 50. But for anyone younger — including the newborns forming america's first \" majority minority \" generation — hispanics are the second-largest population group after whites of european descent. \" it's a major turning point for american society, \" he said. \" we're moving from a largely",

( nikki kahn/the washington post ) for the first time in u.s. History, most of the nation's babies are members of minority groups, according to new census figures that signal the dawn of an era in which whites no longer will be in the majority. Population estimates show that 50.4 percent of children younger than 1 last year were hispanic, black, asian american or in other minority groups. That's almost a full percentage point higher than the 49.5 percent of minority babies counted when the decennial census was taken in april 2010. Census bureau demographers said the tipping point came three months later, in july. The latest estimates, which gauge changes since the last census, are a reflection of an immigration wave that began four decades ago. The transformation of the country's racial and ethnic makeup has gathered steam as the white population grows collectively older, especially compared with hispanics. The census has forecast that non-hispanic whites will be outnumbered in the united states by 2042, and social scientists consider that current status among infants a harbinger of the change. \"this"

That was the first 12-month stretch in which non-hispanic white children accounted for less than half the country's births. The 2008 election of barack obama as america's first black president was in some ways emblematic of the nation's changing face. But as the population evolves toward a more-varied mix that includes fast-growing asian and hispanic populations, the black/white divide that characterized the civil-rights movement has itself become a relic. William h. Frey, a demographer at the brookings institution, says african-americans are the largest minority among adults over 50. But for anyone younger — including the newborns forming america's first \" majority minority \" generation — hispanics are the second-largest population group after whites of european descent. \" it's a major turning point for american society, \" he said. \" we're moving from a largely",

( nikki kahn/the washington post ) for the first time in u.s. History, most of the nation's babies are members of minority groups, according to new census figures that signal the dawn of an era in which whites no longer will be in the majority. Population estimates show that 50.4 percent of children younger than 1 last year were hispanic, black, asian american or in other minority groups. That's almost a full percentage point higher than the 49.5 percent of minority babies counted when the decennial census was taken in april 2010. Census bureau demographers said the tipping point came three months later, in july. The latest estimates, which gauge changes since the last census, are a reflection of an immigration wave that began four decades ago. The transformation of the country's racial and ethnic makeup has gathered steam as the white population grows collectively older, especially compared with hispanics. The census has forecast that non-hispanic whites will be outnumbered in the united states by 2042, and social scientists consider that current status among infants a harbinger of the change. \"this"

His plan sounds a lot like one of those online ads: lose weight with this one trick.

Choosing a smaller plate is just one of several options he puts forward in a new book, slim by design: mindless eating solutions for everyday life. You might also try getting rid of that bag of chips or box of cereal on your counter and replacing it with a fruit bowl, quartz reports. In wansink's research, women who kept cereal on the counter weighed 21 pounds more than those who avoided doing so. Some other tips: don't enter your home through the kitchen, and don't eat at your desk while at work. And try chewing gum while food shopping; gum chewers bought 7 % less junk food than others, another study suggested.

The group invisible children has posted a 30-minute video called \" kony 2012 \" whose sole purpose is to spread the word about his atrocities and raise international pressure to get him arrested. While that may not sound like your typical viral video, it has exploded in popularity over the last 24 hours, in part because it so \" gripping and disturbing, \" notes the san jose mercury news. It helps, too, that invisible children is using a savvy campaign that enlists celebrities to help spread the anti-kony message. Npr's two-way blog calls the video a \" powerful piece of work \" and provides more background about the campaign. That includes pointing to this foreign affairs article, which accuses invisible children and other groups of having \" manipulated facts \" to portray \" kony — a brutal man, to be sure — as uniquely awful, a kurtz-like embodiment of evil. \" see the video in the gallery, which includes a push for a day of activism on april 20.",

The kony 2012 campaign employs film, social media, street art, and face-to-face interaction to make the case that the arrest of joseph kony this year is one thing we can all agree on.

But once you have expressed yourself, please move on. \" thousands of police guarded the embassy, a sign that china wanted to avoid protests turning violent as they did over the weekend. But, though protests remained mostly peaceful, some demonstrators were attacking japanese companies including toyota and honda, leading hundreds of such businesses to temporarily shut down, the christian science monitor reports. The embassy also suspended services. Meanwhile, japan was boosting defenses around the islands as a 1,000-strong flotilla of chinese fishing boats reportedly approached. Japan hasn't seen them yet, but did say 10 chinese patrol boats are in the area, and added that two japanese nationals landed on one of the islands today. China quickly complained, the wall street journal reports, and also asserted that it reserves the right to \" take further actions, \" perhaps military ones if necessary, according to the defense minister. Further complicating the situation, taiwan also claims the disputed area, but wants to help resolve the conflict, voice of america reports.",

Hamilton was nominated in virtually every category it could compete in, from acting to scenic design.

The new york times notes that those competitors probably realize they don't have much of a shot against miranda's powerhouse production, but they know the nomination itself may help boost ticket sales for their own musicals. Deadline reports hamilton has already brought in a never-before-seen $ 80 million in advance ticket sales since it began its official great white way run in august.

Leading the pack are hamilton, with a record-breaking 16 nominations, and shuffle along, with 10 nominations including best musical. Danai gurira's eclipsed, about women in war-torn liberia ( and marking the broadway debut of oscar winner lupita nyong ' o ), and stephen karam's the humans, about a family's struggles in post-9/11 manhattan, will face off in the the best play category. The nominees reflect an extraordinarily diverse range of on- and offstage talent. Filling out the card for best musical are waitress, marking the broadway debut of pop singer-songwriter sara bareilles leading an all-female creative team; steve martin and edie brickell's bluegrass-inspired musical bright star; and andrew lloyd webber's return to hit form with his adaptation of school of rock, written with downton abbey author julian fellowes.

On tuesday, the hip-hop musical about america's first treasury secretary added another mark of distinction: it was nominated for 16 tony awards, more than any other show in broadway history. Tony nominators deemed the show prize-worthy in every category of theatermaking — acting, writing, directing, dance, music and design. A whopping seven \"hamilton \" performers were singled out; in two categories, \"hamilton \" actors will compete against one another. \"it's unbelievable — it's absolutely humbling and incredible, \" said the show's 36-year-old creator and star, lin-manuel miranda, who was nominated for three awards himself, for his book, his music and his performance in the title role.

Putin boasted that the new icbms would be able to overcome the most advanced defense systems, reports the bbc. \" this nuclear sabre-rattling of russia is unjustified, it's destabilizing, and it's dangerous, \" says nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg. He says russia's increasing aggressions, especially in ukraine, explain why nato is beefing up its eastern european defenses. But russian deputy defense chief anatoly antonov, citing the us plan, says \" our colleagues from nato countries are pushing us into an arms race. \"",

Soon, police also recovered two notebooks, the pages of which discussed spirituality, salvation, the ritual and mentioned a few dates. The recoveries of the notes, the signs of a 'hawan ' ( a ritual involving burning of offerings such as ghee and grains ) in the house and the manner in which the bodies were found have given police enough reasons to suspect that the family might have died in a religious ritual gone wrong. \"almost every step mentioned in the note seems to be have been religiously followed by the family, \" said a police officer. The steps for \"obtaining salvation \" were written point wise in hindi, each marked with an arrow. One important rule was that the family was to avoid using mobile phones and not disclose the rituals to anyone else. It took the police"

However, it does not apply retroactively so the 89-year-old mugabe could technically extend his three decades in office by another 10 years. A beaming mugabe, flanked by prime minister morgan tsvangirai, his main political rival, and deputy president joice mujuru signed multiple copies of the charter at state house in the capital to cheers and applause from aides.

However, many obstacles remain, not least finding the estimated $ 130 million needed to pay for the election and reaching agreement on outside monitors.

In reality, those signs held a much more innocent message. The station reports that several residents contacted the sheriff's office out of concern over the handwritten signs. After some investigation, the sheriff determined the signs were \" not in anyway affiliated with isis \" and actually contained a \" welcome home \" message written in hebrew. Specifically, the signs read, \" welcome home, yamit \" in what the times of israel describes as a \" boxy hebrew scrawl \" likely done by a child or a non-native israeli. The lowering the bar blog has a few pieces of advice for people to keep in mind to avoid similar sign-induced panic in the future. First: \" you are not necessarily in danger just because you see something you don't recognize. \" second, gardner is \" not known to be high on the list of isis targets. \" finally, terrorists aren't likely to communicate with each other via conspicuous signage, and if the signs were meant to terrorize residents, they would probably be written in english.",

        "summary": "Researchers at stanford university have discovered what a press release calls a \" fast and efficient \" way to stop jet lag before it starts: repeatedly flashing light into your eyes while you sleep. \" if you are flying to new york tomorrow, tonight you use the light therapy, \" dr. Jamie zeitzer says. \" if you normally wake up at 8am, you set the flashing light to go off at 5am. When you get to new york, your biological system is already in the process of shifting to east coast time. \" a flash every 10 seconds for one hour, used toward the end of the night, will push the body's circadian rhythm forward by about two hours, the wall street journal explains. Using the flashes of light at the beginning of the night, on the other hand, will delay the circadian clock and could be helpful when the aforementioned traveler heads back to the west coast. Current in-advance methods for dealing with jet lag and sleep-cycle issues involve continuous light administered while awake. Not only did the study find flashing lights to be more effective — they change the body's circadian rhythm up to three times faster than a steady light — they don't interrupt a person's life. \" most people can sleep through the flashing light just fine, \" zeitzer says in the press release. Researchers are hoping to have a light-flashing sleep mask available for consumers later this year. This same method could be used to help people who work the night shift or have seasonal affective disorder. And researchers are currently testing it on a group of teens to improve school performance. \" we're basically looking to intentionally jet lag teens so that they can go to bed at a reasonable time, \" zeitzer tells the journal.

An israeli defense unit says that \" credible intelligence \" shows avraham mangisto, said by israeli media to be a 28-year-old ethiopian-israeli, is being held \" against his will \" by hamas and that \" israel has appealed [ to ] international and regional interlocutors to demand his immediate release and verify his well-being, \" reports fox news. Mangisto reportedly entered gaza of his own accord from an israeli beach on sept. 7 last year, just a couple of weeks after a ceasefire was declared to end last summer's gaza war. Israeli defense officials say an arab-israeli citizen is also being held, though details are scarce, the new york times notes. The cases are drawing comparison to that of gilad shalit, an israeli soldier who was held for five years by hamas until his release in 2011 in exchange for more than 1,000 palestinian prisoners. The news of the reported captives was made public only after israeli military officials lifted a gag order this morning, though it wasn't clear why the order was suddenly lifted, nbc news reports. Mangisto's brother ilan spoke at a press conference this morning about what he's calling \" a difficult humanitarian matter, \" revealing that his brother isn't doing well healthwise, reports the new york times. \" i ' m asking the international community to engage and use their power to free my brother, \" he said, per nbc. \" i ask ( hamas ) to take into consideration his health and to release him immediately. \" meanwhile, their father told israel's channel 2 that avraham often went missing for days on end and had been depressed after another brother killed himself. A hamas spokesman says, per fox news, \" we don't have any information about it. Even if is true, we don't have instructions to talk about it. \" ( israeli officials said they foiled a major hamas terror plot in november. )",

        "summary": "Identical twins share an identical dna profile, and when you're an investigator examining dna evidence, that can be a problem. The cases may be rare, but they exist, legal expert jennifer mnookin told the new york times last year amid a rape case involving a suspect with a twin: \" there certainly have been instances where identical twins have laid blame on the other, or each denied responsibility, and for a lack of persuasive evidence they've both gotten off. \" but new research could help prosecutors get past that hurdle, science daily reports. British scientists have found that by heating dna to its \" melting temperature, \" they can distinguish between twins. In what the researchers call \" high resolution melt curve analysis, \" heat is applied to dna; the melting temperature refers to the temperature at which the hydrogen bonds in our dna break. Environmental factors can alter the number of hydrogen bonds in a dna sequence: one twin could be a smoker, for instance, or be exposed to more sunlight. More bonds lead to a higher melting temperature. To arrive at their findings, published in analytical biochemistry, researchers had five sets of identical twins supply their dna via a cheek swab; using hrma and looking at two genetic markers, the researchers were able to distinguish between all five sets in one case, and four of the five in the case of the second marker. But some issues remain, lead researcher dr. Graham williams notes. One is that the process requires \" a high sample quantity \" of dna that might not be available at a crime scene. ( this week, a man's charges were dropped — in part thanks to dna evidence — after he had spent 36 years in prison. )",

The probability of a dna match between two unrelated individuals is about one in a billion. For two full siblings, the probability drops to one-in-10,000. But identical twins present exactly the same dna profile as each other and this has created legal conundrums when it was not possible to tell which of the pair was guilty or innocent of a crime.

Using a technique called morphometrics to analyze photos of 400 \" mata ' a \" for shape variability, they found that the tools simply weren't designed to deal damage in the way that weapons must. \" when you look at the shape of these things, they just don't look like weapons at all, \" the lead researcher says in a press release. \" when there are actually objects used for warfare, they're very systematic in their shape.

Divorce rumors concerning the couple are now all over the internet and interestingly, there have been no denials from either kim or kanye! kanye is beyond angry about his wife's nude cover, and not because it showed all her lady bits, reports naughty gossip. Kanye west is fuming over the fact that kris and kim arranged the cover to highlight two things … her ample assets and her maiden name. Kim has been aching to separate from kanye and is begging kris jenner to help her with damage control over the split as she figures out how to divorce her third husband.

But on jordan thiering's list, this odd item: go to court to secure her right to her placenta. The mississippi woman had determined she wanted to eat the placenta that was sustaining her unborn son after his birth. It's an age-old practice called placentophagy that webmd points out is practiced in the animal kingdom and among tribal women — and a trendier set, with the atlantic noting that celebs like kourtney kardashian and january jones have extolled the practice. And while a 2015 analysis of 10 studies on the subject found it provided no \" protection against postpartum depression \" and had no positive effect on lactation, energy, or maternal bonding, thiering didn't care. \" if it does nothing, it does nothing, but it's the whole perspective of being able to kind of have what i want, rightfully so, \" she tells the clarion-ledger. But when the brandon woman told her doctor about her plan to encapsulate the organ, which typically weighs about a pound by the baby's birth, her doctor suggested she check with the hospital. It gave her some surprising news — she needed a court order. A memo provided to the newspaper by state epidemiologist dr. Thomas dobbs explains the state's view: that no hospital \" may release non-infectious medical waste ( including placental tissue ) without there first having been obtained by a court order... Which will assure proper disposal by the release. \" her petition was granted by the court on may 17, and her attorney hopes thiering has \" paved the way \" for other women.

Per rolling stone, taylor swift made use in may of a special kiosk at her california rose bowl show that secretly scanned concertgoers ' faces, then shot those pictures back to a \" command post \" in nashville, tenn. There, the faces were compared with those of \" hundreds \" of swift's known stalkers. Intel on the surreptitious spying kiosk, which was showing clips of the pop star rehearsing to lure spectators so their faces could then be photographed, comes via a security expert who says he was invited to watch a demo of the system at the rose bowl show by the kiosk manufacturer; swift's own reps are keeping tight-lipped about it. Mashable calls it a \" creepy \" yet \" understandable \" use of the technology, considering the trouble swift has had with alleged stalkers in the past.

        "summary": "Joe howlett had just tapped into his extensive knowledge of knots to free yet another whale off the coast of new brunswick on monday, part of his job with canada's campobello whale rescue team, and then: \" some kind of freak thing happened and the whale made a big flip, \" says mackie green, who co-founded the rescue group with howlett, per the canadian press. The guardian reports that howlett, a lobster fisherman who died as a result of the incident, had rescued another north atlantic right whale just days before, bringing his total over the past 15 years or so to about 24. The region has been dealing with an alarming influx of whale deaths, with seven north atlantic right whale carcasses being found in the gulf of st. Lawrence in the past month alone — what some estimate to be about 1 % of the total worldwide population. An expert from the canadian whale institute tells the canadian press and the cbc that the 59-year-old howlett likely wouldn't have been immersed in the water himself, as rescuers typically do their release work from inflatable rubber boats. He adds that the giant mammals can't move that much while they're tangled up in ropes, but that once a whale is freed, the rescue boat usually backs off to avoid the wrath of a possibly irate animal. Canada's fisheries department notes in a statement that it takes \" immense bravery \" to deal with trapped whales. And green says his group will continue to do just that, because that's what howlett would've wanted. \" there's no better feeling than getting a whale untangled, \" green says, describing howlett to the canadian press as \" the life of the party. \" ( in alaska, orcas are making off with fishermen's catch. )",

While audiences give batman v superman a 74 % approval rating on rotten tomatoes, critics are hovering at the 30 % mark, calling the film, well, a disaster. Here's what they're saying: \" the film might be pretty to look at \" — some scenes even come \" close to high art \" — but it's \" a shambolic, ill-advised, white-hot mess of a movie, \" writes barry hertz in a 1.5-star review at the globe and mail. \" there are so many baffling elements to bvs that singling out any one is to be paralyzed by choice. \" one example: director zack snyder's \" complete mishandling \" of superman as \" kind of a jerk, \" hertz says. Snyder also \" diminishes every female character. \" \" this is what happens when you give a bad director a quarter-billion or so dollars, \" writes chris klimek at npr. He calls the film a \" ponderous, smothering, over-pixelated zeppelin crash of a movie \" that is \" confusing before it gets boring, and boring before it gets bruising. \" about 23 % of the film he liked. The rest, not so much. Andrew o ' hehir is a bit more forgiving, saying he was mostly entertained for all 151 minutes. \" snyder's ocd-level attention to the visual details, \" jesse eisenberg's portrayal of lex luthor, and gal gadot's wonder woman, \" who brings in a badly needed dose of dragon tattoo-style female energy, \" rescue the film from being awful, he writes at salon. Yet the film \" is kind of dopey and plays out some laborious plot twists in the dc narrative at unnecessary length. \" matthew lickona at the san diego reader keeps his review short and not-so-sweet. The flick is \" in a word, exhausting. In a few more, overblown, overstuffed, repetitive, bombastic, and sometimes just dumb. ( never mind dreary to look at and punishing to hear. ) \" too bad there's \" a bunch of sequel-bait, \" to boot. ( but ben affleck says the movie is for fans, not critics. )",
