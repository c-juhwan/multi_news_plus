        "summary": "A new ruling from the california supreme court might mean big trouble for the business model of companies such as uber and lyft. The upshot is that monday's decision makes it harder for companies to classify employees as independent contractors, reports the los angeles times. \" this could ruin the gig economy as we know it, \" is one quote from an attorney not involved in the case cited in a report at law.com. \" it's a massive thing — definitely a game-changer that will force everyone to take a fresh look at the whole issue, \" is another collected by the new york times. The court applied what's known as the \" abc test \" to determine who qualifies as an independent contractor. This cornell law blog post has details on the criteria, but it boils down to this: if the worker performs a task that is part of the \" usual course \" of the company's business, he is an employee, not a contractor. The court provided examples: if a store hires a plumber to fix a leak, the plumber is an independent contractor. But if a clothing company provides material and patterns to a seamstress who sews dresses in her home, the seamstress is an employee. In its ruling, the california court followed the lead of the top court in new jersey, but the california decision is expected to have a far greater impact because companies such uber and lyft are headquartered there. As law.com notes, similar cases in other state courts were on hold waiting for the california decision. \" a huge number of businesses will be calling their lawyers saying ' what should i do? ' \" a professor at the usc gould school of law tells the la times. The ruling came in a lawsuit against a package and document delivery company called dynamex that was accused of misclassifying drivers as contractors.",

The two were detained after other visitors at the auschwitz-birkenau concentration camp spotted the pair loading bricks from the ruins of a crematorium into a bag, polish police said monday. Security officers were alerted and police were called to the scene. \" the man and woman were charged with theft of a cultural asset. They both admitted to wrongdoing, \" regional police press officer mateusz drwal told polish news agency pap. The 30-year-old woman and 36-year-old man were each fined $ 405 and handed a one-year prison sentence on probation. \" they explained that they had wanted to bring back a souvenir and didn't realize the consequences of their actions, \" drwal said. Auschwitz-birkenau is one of several death camps built and operated by nazi germany in occupied poland during the second world war. The nazis murdered an estimated 1 million jews there between 1940 and 1945. More than 100,000 others, including non-jewish poles, roma"

        "summary": "Recently released court documents suggest that traders at barclays, the royal bank of scotland, and ubs were most central to the libor-rigging scandal, reports reuters. Those three banks — much of the blame has fallen on just barclay's up to now — employed more than a dozen traders who tried influencing dollar, euro, and yen rates. As several of those traders under investigation worked at a variety of banks over the years and still have senior jobs on wall street, investigators believe they made rate-fixing more systematic over the years. According to prosecutors'documents, euro and dollar rate-rigging appears to have begun in 2005, spreading into the yen rate market by 2007 by rbs and usb. Traders at jpmorgan chase and deutsche bank are also reportedly under investigation. On the other hand, one former morgan stanley trader writes in the financial times that he warned of libor-rigging going on way back in 1991. \" libor misreporting has been going on for decades, \" writes douglas keenan. \" why have investigations only recently begun? \"",

Until now, most of the attention has involved traders at barclays, which last month reached a $ 453 million settlement with u.s. And uk authorities for its role in the manipulation of rates. Now, it is becoming clear that traders from at least two other banks - uk-based royal bank of scotland group plc and switzerland's ubs ag - played a central role. Among them, the three banks employed more than a dozen traders who sought to influence rates in either dollar, euro or yen rates. Some of the traders who are being probed have worked for several banks under scrutiny, raising the possibility that the rate fixing became more ingrained as traders changed jobs. The documents reviewed by reuters in analyzing the traders ' involvement included court filings by canadian regulators who have been investigating potential antitrust issues; settlement documents with barclays filed by the u.s.

Maybe the height of her fame came in the 1980s with hollywood wives, which sold 15 million copies — while her sister was starring on dynasty, notes ap. Her book spawned a tv miniseries of the same name. Some quotes collected from the various obituaries, including reuters and the los angeles times: \" a lot of people say to me, ' oh, i read your books under a cover with a flashlight when i was really young and i learned everything i know about sex from you.

White tells new jersey 101.5 that parker, who carried his possessions in a plastic bag, had a job interview on monday and thought the new-looking backpack he saw in the garbage was exactly what he needed — until he saw what was inside. Norma bowe, director of the be the change nj activist group, says the group found parker and put him in touch with the homeless charity after hearing his story. \" he literally moved that bomb, was there all night with the police, and then slept in an abandoned building, \" she says. \" we can do better than that. \" nj.com reports that well-wishers have given parker clothes and food — and a new backpack.",

The former mayor of pitcairn island has been convicted of possessing more than 1,000 images and videos showing the sexual abuse of children, reports vice, which notes that michael warren is the eighth man of the island's male population of about 12 to be accused of sex crimes against children. The island's total population is about 50. Prosecutors say warren, mayor between 2008 and 2013, began downloading the images more than a decade ago, the guardian reports. Warren's possession of the images was first discovered when he mistakenly sent an email to a diplomatic staff member from an email address linked to a chat site containing explicit images. Warren downloaded the images during a period in which he was working in child protection on the island. Initially, he defended himself by saying he did so to understand child pornography after the 2004 scandal, in which seven of the island's men were accused of 55 sex crimes. Defendants in that trial argued that sex between men and young girls was a cultural tradition on pitcairn. Those men received sentences ranging from community service to six years in prison, while warren was sentenced to 20 months. It is unclear if he will serve the sentence in new zealand, where the island's legal proceedings are conducted, or as the sole inmate of pitcairn's prison, which was constructed by islanders convicted of sex crimes. The island desperately needs new immigrants to survive, and warren's case surely won't help. ( in the us, some former vets are now going after child predators. )",

Michael warren, who served as mayor of the tiny south pacific island from 2008 to 2013, could become the only inmate in the island's prison, after being handed a 20-month sentence by a court in new zealand for charges stemming back as far as 2004.

The exact cost of the trip is unknown, but based on the military's most recent estimate that air force one costs $ 181,757 per hour to operate, the paper estimates the cost of the flight alone at $ 3,271,622, plus another $ 100,000 or so for michelle obama's early flight down. The trip will be more expensive than past vacations, the paper said, because obama extended it by three days, and because the price of running air force one has jumped. The piece has garnered criticism on conservative sites, and even prompted one reporter to ask jay carney if michelle obama's early trip \"isn't quite an extravagance, \" according to politico. Carney said she was traveling alone via military aircraft \"as previous first ladies have done. \"",

But by claiming only a single victory in the state he once represented in congress, gingrich's viability -- even as a regional candidate -- is in doubt. Gingrich took a blowout win in georgia, called by television networks as polls closed to a round of cheers in a cobb county hotel ballroom, but it would be his only super tuesday triumph: pennsylvania sen. Rick santorum bested gingrich in tennessee and oklahoma, where gingrich had attempted to compete.

And the 35 number is likely an underreporting, as propublica searched only court cases, media accounts, and government inspection reports. One da suspects other similar incidents have gone unreported because the victims often suffer from dementia and don't realize what took place; in most cases, the photos or videos were discovered only because someone who saw the postings alerted authorities or officials.

Whether it was \" evil \" remains up in the air. New research out of uc berkeley and harvard suggests every sun in the universe is born with a fraternal twin. In fact, earth's closest neighbor, alpha centauri, is a triplet system. Astronomers have long puzzled over binary and triplet solar systems and what becomes of sidekick suns, which are actually stars. And in one of space's most tantalizing mysteries, researchers have long theorized that a dwarf star dubbed nemesis once rattled our solar system so fiercely that it unleashed killer comets toward earth, obliterating the dinosaurs. \" we are saying, yes, there probably was a nemesis, a long time ago, \" says study co-author steven stahler. The study does not, however, address whether nemesis had any role in the dinosaurs ' fate. Researchers say the wayward sun likely broke free and ambled off into the milky way billions of years ago, never to be heard from again, reports space.com. The website thinks this exonerates nemesis in regard to dinosaurs: it would have been long gone by the time the dinosaurs arrived. But a post at science alert isn't so sure: it notes that one theory holds that nemesis still swings by our solar system periodically and thus could cause trouble. In the study, scientists used data from giant telescopes in new mexico and hawaii, along with a mathematical model they designed, to focus on the star-studded perseus constellation about 600 light-years away.

        "summary": "There's a literal casualty of venezuela's ongoing economic woes: those with kidney problems. Reuters dives into the dire situation that both kidney transplant recipients and those hoping to join their ranks face in the midst of the country's inability to buy enough drugs from abroad or make enough domestically. Usa today cites the pharmaceutical federation of venezuela in saying the country was experiencing an 85 % shortage of medicine — and that was as of june 2017. There are some 16,000 people who require dialysis, but the country's ability to clean their blood is waning, with an opposition lawmaker and oncologist saying only about half of the country's dialysis units are operational. Codevida, a health-related ngo, logged seven deaths in the first few weeks of february due to a lack of dialysis. But dialysis patients, many hopeful for a future transplant, aren't the only ones dying. About 3,500 venezuelans have had kidney transplants, and that number is slowly being chipped away at as they find themselves unable to obtain the anti-organ rejection drugs they need to take for the rest of their lives. A 40-year-old woman lost the transplanted kidney she's had for nearly 20 years and is now on dialysis, though she's encountering issues there, too; a 45-year-old man is trying to hang onto his by taking immunosuppressants made for animals. In the case of two brothers who received transplants, one died in november after going a month without medicine. Says his brother, \" if you lose your kidney, you go to dialysis, but there are no materials. So you go straight to the cemetery. \" deutsche welle reports hiv patients there are trapped in a similar situation.",

Her immune system had attacked the foreign organ and she lost her kidney shortly afterwards. Now, castano needs dialysis three times a week to filter her blood.

        "summary": "Several us states, including georgia, utah, and idaho, have enacted laws or are considering bills allowing for \" abortion reversals. \" per the concept driven by california doctor george delgado, if a woman takes only the first of two pills in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and regrets her decision, he ' ll pump her full of progesterone to try to counteract the first pill. Medical community members, however, say delgado is \" experimenting on women \" and using a highly flawed clinical trial of just six pregnant women to spread his agenda, reports marie claire. Still, state governments are using it as the basis of bills requiring women who seek abortions to receive info about abortion reversals, with a disclaimer the procedure isn't scientifically vetted. \" we're just saying you have the right to try. We're not saying it's going to work, \" gop rep. Ben smaltz of indiana said earlier this year. Critics argue high levels of progesterone have yet to be tested for either safety or efficacy. The four women he wrote about who went on to carry to term ( two didn't make it that far ) had only taken the first pill, mifepristone, which is less than 50 % effective on its own. ( abortion success rates shoot up to 97 % when the second pill, misoprostol, is taken. ) \" just as we have laws protecting babies who have already been born from being killed, we should have laws protecting unborn people from being killed, \" delgado, a practicing catholic, argues. He's also on the record calling contraception \" evil, \" saying hiv-positive men shouldn't wear condoms when having sex with their wives because it's a \" barrier \" to the \" conjugal embrace. \" his abortion-reversal hotline has received more than 1,800 calls since 2012, 600 of them in 2016 alone, with women paying $ 200 to $ 1,500 for out-of-pocket treatment.",

That never entered my mind to flee. \" the final witness was a homicide detective who investigated the shooting, and jurors asked him a long series of questions. \" this officer felt he was in danger of being beaten to death sitting in his car, you could almost say there was a weapon involved at that point, that's where i ' m confused a little bit, \" one juror said. \" i understand no weapon in the form of",

Cnnmoney reports that the european court of justice decided businesses not wanting to give an appearance of having any political, philosophical, or religious leanings can ask employees to keep to a dress code that doesn't include any such representative symbols or signs. Not allowing the two muslim plaintiffs, as well as any other women, to wear the headscarf isn't discriminatory, the court notes, as long as symbols from other affiliations are similarly nixed. Nbc news notes the ecj's ruling applies to all 28 countries in the eu. One thing the new ruling doesn't allow: a worker forced to stop sporting a religious or political symbol just because a customer requests it — though if the company already has a ban in place, it wouldn't be discriminatory to make that request. Per the guardian, this case revolved around an ex-receptionist for security firm g4s, pink-slipped in 2006 for not taking off her headscarf when asked, as well as a former design engineer for it consultancy company micropole, which fired her after a client said her headscarf \" embarrassed \" company staff during a visit. Francois fillon, a conservative running for french president, hailed the decision as an \" immense relief, \" per the independent, noting it would bring \" social peace, \" but the policy officer for the open society justice initiative says the decision could \" exclude many muslim women from the workplace. \" ( nike has a new hijab for athletes. )",

Jalopnik reports the driver was on the autobahn near munich when he saw an out-of-control volkswagen passat swerve across the road and repeatedly hit a guardrail. The tesla driver caught up with the passat and realized the driver was near unconsciousness, according to the local. The tesla driver first called fire services, then did something officials would later say \" showed incredible courage \": he purposefully crashed his tesla. Electrek notes that tesla owners are typically super careful about their cars because dings to the lightweight aluminum bodies can be expensive to repair. Regardless, the driver of the tesla got in front of the passat and hit the brakes. The passat crashed into the back of the tesla, and both cars slowed to a stop. The tesla driver's actions allowed the passat driver, who was likely having a stroke, to get medical help more quickly and prevented a potentially more dangerous accident. While waiting for fire services to arrive, the tesla driver administered first aid to the passat driver, who is now in stable condition. Damage to the vehicles was estimated at more than $ 10,000, not that the tesla driver will have to worry about that. After hearing about what happened, tesla ceo elon musk said tesla will cover the repairs, according to inside evs. ( a tesla owner got stranded in the desert — and not for the reason you might think. )",

It's an encouraging idea, as the researchers put it, \" that a person can, by assuming two simple one-minute poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful. \" ( see some of the poses here. ) but new findings are casting doubt on the original us study, ars technica reports. A university of zurich researcher led an effort to replicate the findings, but it didn't work out the same way. Both studies involved participants giving saliva samples and engaging in various poses, either \" open \" or more closed-in. But the new study involved 200 participants, compared to the original study's 42. And in the new study, participants got their instructions through a computer rather than a person, thus theoretically preventing the possibility that an experimenter was creating some kind of bias with her instructions. After performing their poses, subjects participated in games along the lines of gambling, which involved deciding what level of risk to take or how competitive to be. While the subjects who'd performed power poses said they felt more powerful, they didn't actually behave differently in the games, ars technica reports, nor did saliva samples indicate a difference in hormones between the two groups. Still, there are a number of complicating factors, including the fact that the two studies were performed in different countries.

            "In 2010, researchers at harvard business school claimed to have found ( pdf ) that striking powerful poses caused hormonal and behavioral changes. \" power poses \" seemed to raise testosterone, lower cortisol, and increase risk-taking behavior. As with all research, replication was needed to check the validity of the results. An attempt at replication using additional controls, published recently in psychological science, found no behavioral or hormonal effects of \"power poses, \" although they did result in a boost in subjective perception of power. In other words, the original research did not hold up. The idea that powerful poses could have hormonal effects ties in with a prominent idea in behavioral science: the hypothesis that physical interaction with the environment affects cognitive behavior. It would make sense that there should be a physiological vehicle ( such as hormonal changes ) for this effect. A team of researchers led by eva ranehill at the university of zurich tried to replicate the original harvard business school study with some important tweaks. First, they used a bigger sample size. The original study used 42 participants; the replication used 200. Secondly, they controlled for experimenter's bias, which is the",

More specifically, powerful leaders tend to have higher levels of testosterone and lower levels of cortisol. Higher levels of testosterone ( in both men and women ) lead to increased feelings of confidence. Meanwhile, lower levels of cortisol lead to decreased anxiety and an improved ability to deal with stress. Here's what that means: if you enjoy these hormone levels, then you are biologically primed to be more assertive"

            "In 2010, researchers at harvard business school claimed to have found ( pdf ) that striking powerful poses caused hormonal and behavioral changes. \" power poses \" seemed to raise testosterone, lower cortisol, and increase risk-taking behavior. As with all research, replication was needed to check the validity of the results. An attempt at replication using additional controls, published recently in psychological science, found no behavioral or hormonal effects of \"power poses, \" although they did result in a boost in subjective perception of power. In other words, the original research did not hold up. The idea that powerful poses could have hormonal effects ties in with a prominent idea in behavioral science: the hypothesis that physical interaction with the environment affects cognitive behavior. It would make sense that there should be a physiological vehicle ( such as hormonal changes ) for this effect. A team of researchers led by eva ranehill at the university of zurich tried to replicate the original harvard business school study with some important tweaks. First, they used a bigger sample size. The original study used 42 participants; the replication used 200. Secondly, they controlled for experimenter's bias, which is the",

Even many conservative pundits praised her performance, while some of the giddier democrats are now hoping she plans her own run for office. She \" knocked it out of the park \" by delivering \" a series of devastating contrasts with the romney family and policy agenda, cloaked in the bromides of wifely love, \" writes garance franke-rute at the atlantic. Michelle \" reminded that she hasn't just been growing vegetables in the white house garden — she's been sharpening her political skills, too. \" michelle \" turned in a masterful showing, delivering a subtly yet distinctly political speech without seeming to do so, \" writes guy benson at townhall.com. \" it remains to be seen whether her uber-personal reintroduction of ' barack ' will sway too many viewers, but i think she did everything she could on her husband's behalf. \" \" in a cloyingly theatrical modern tradition, first ladies attend the national conventions to testify about biography, not policy, \" writes irin carmon at salon. But michelle \" managed to effortlessly marshal both to tell a story about change in america — with the promise of more to come — and to deliver her speech transcendently. \" michelle \" largely avoided the treacly pitfalls of the spouse's speech, in favor of crystal clear, passionate advocacy for her husband's work, and the values that guide it, \" writes tommy christopher at mediaite. His favorite line was: \" success isn't about how much money you make, it's about the difference you make in people's lives, \" though \" it's a tossup as to whether the sentiment, lovely on the lips, gets any traction on the ground. \"",

Anecdotal evidence seems to support the timeline, with one fda analyst recalling the time around her new daughter's conception as \" all kind of hazy, \" while a pentagon worker cops to \" celebrating congressional action \" with his wife. Similar booms have been positively correlated with other major events — including the 1995 oklahoma city bombing and a series of east coast hurricane warnings, notes the post. But not everyone's convinced: at least three other dc-area hospitals tell the post they haven't seen any \" significant \" increase, and a sociologist who spoke with mcclatchy dc says that seemingly burgeoning birth rates after such events are \" usually … just romantic hypotheses with nothing to support them. \" ( read about a massive native american baby boom that reportedly took place 1,500 years ago. )",

It just celebrated its 112th birthday, and it's the oldest cured ham in the world you could conceivably still eat, the museum says, per the wall street journal. The ham is one of three kept side-by-side in cases that block out bugs and mold while silica trays keep things dry. An expert lends support to the edibility idea: \" from a microbiological standpoint, it's got an indefinite shelf life once you remove enough of the water, \" says a food microbiologist. Still, he notes, that doesn't mean it would taste good. Meanwhile, a food standards official isn't so sure it would be safe to eat: \" after such a long time, and without knowing how the ham was processed, it's difficult to know, \" he says.

            "A ham in the us said to be the oldest in the world has celebrated its 112th birthday. Can it really be edible after all this time, asks tom de castella. It was first cured by the gwaltney meat company in 1902, forgotten about at the back of a storage room, and eventually donated to the isle of wight county museum in smithfield, virginia. Today it looks like a piece of old leather. A special case protects it from bugs and mould, and it is billed the world's oldest edible cured ham. \" it would be dry, dry tasting, but it's not molded, \" curator tracey neikirk told the wall street journal. The answer it might not be dangerous, but the ham would not taste pleasant it would be extremely dry and have a rancid flavour dry curing - salting the meat and draining the blood - allows ham to last and develop a richer flavour. But most hams are only aged for a year or two. Not 112. \" after such a long time and without knowing how the ham was processed it's difficult to know whether it would be safe, \" a food standards agency spokesman says. To most people \" edible \" means more than the ability to eat something without it killing you. \" jamon iberico of four to five years is amazing, \" says jose pizarro, owner of pizarro, a spanish restaurant in london. \" the oldest edible ham he's heard of is eight years old. After that the fat starts to oxidise and the flavour disappears from the meat. A rancid taste develops as the yellow fat diffuses, and as the decades pass it will become as hard as a stone and incredibly ugly, he says. And then there's the question of whether the virginia museum's really is the oldest. In 1993, michael feller, a butcher in oxford, bought a ham at auction that was 101 years old. It looked \" rather yukky \" but was edible, although he wasn't going to cut into it. Today it hangs in the shop window, unnibbled at the ripe old age of 122.

Today it looks like a piece of old leather. A special case protects it from bugs and mould, and it is billed the world's oldest edible cured ham. \" it would be dry, dry tasting, but it's not molded, \" curator tracey neikirk told the wall street journal. The answer it might not be dangerous, but the ham would not taste pleasant it would be extremely dry and have a rancid flavour dry curing - salting the meat and draining the blood - allows ham to last and develop a richer flavour. But most hams are only aged for a year or two. Not 112. \" after such a long time and without knowing how the ham was processed it's difficult to know whether it would be safe, \" a food standards agency spokesman says. To most people \" edible \" means more than the ability to eat something without it killing you. \" jamon iberico of four to five years is amazing, \" says jose pizarro, owner of pizarro, a spanish restaurant in london. \" the oldest edible ham he's heard of is eight years old. After that the fat starts to oxidise and the flavour disappears from the meat. A rancid taste develops as the yellow fat diffuses, and as the decades pass it will become as hard as a stone and incredibly ugly, he says. And then there's the question of whether the virginia museum's really is the oldest. In 1993, michael feller, a butcher in oxford, bought a ham at auction that was 101 years old. It looked \" rather yukky \" but was edible, although he wasn't going to cut into it. Today it hangs in the shop window, unnibbled at the ripe old age of 122. Food writer jay rayner is unmoved by the battle for the title of oldest ham. \" i'd be"

Then the 36-year-old woman hanged herself in the basement of her home in fairfield, conn., police say. Sometime later, however, krekhtyak's daughter, anna — who had only lost consciousness — woke up. After finding her mother's body, the girl ran to a neighbor for help, reports the connecticut post. Authorities, who responded around 10: 30am saturday, are now trying to piece together the tragedy as anna has \" some memory issues with regard to exactly what occurred, \" fairfield police chief gary macnamara tells nbc connecticut. Despite that, he says \" strangulation marks \" suggest \" strangulation was meant to kill her. \" anna — who was listed in stable condition at a hospital monday, per people — had previously contacted police at least once over fears her mother was suicidal, and she wasn't the only one to do so. However, police say they never felt krekhtyak's daughter was in danger over the course of several visits to the home. During one visit, krekhtyak told police she was depressed, but not suicidal, over her husband's suicide in july 2015. Police say vasyl krekhtyak, 38, had been working in florida but returned to connecticut to visit a doctor. Shortly after, he was found hanged in a wooded area near fairfield university. His wife told authorities he had mental health issues and had been hearing voices, per the fairfield daily voice. ( a man was accused of trying to kill his son in a car crash. )",

        "summary": "Six of the contestants who lost the miss corpus christi latina pageant not only think the pageant crowned the wrong winner, they're suing over it. Their lawsuit makes the case that caitlin cifuentes, 25, should not have received the crown on june 11 because of her criminal record and a past marriage, reports the houston chronicle. Specifically, the suit argues that cifuentes should have been disqualified because she is on deferred adjudicated probation for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, along with probation for misdemeanor dui. Those charges stem from a 2013 car crash that injured four people, reports courthouse news service. The lawsuit is seeking $ 100,000 from pageant director kayla alvarez, who stands by the decision to crown cifuentes. \" just because you have a bad background... Doesn't mean that should hold you back from accomplishing your goals, \" alvarez tells the corpus christi caller-times. \" she's worked very hard and the judges saw that and she won fair and square. \" alvarez says cifuentes ' probationary status means she was never technically convicted and was therefore still eligible to compete. While the suit cites a clause in the agreement all contestants signed that begins \" i have never been married, \" alvarez says the rule against no marriages applies only to the teen competition, with divorced adults eligible for the \" miss \" title. The suit also argues that due to cifuentes ' probation, her travel outside of nueces county is dependent on the nueces county probation department's approval. As of now, cifuentes is still on track to compete for the state latina title in august. ( want to win miss universe? this yale law grad can help. )",

He remembered telling trump that \" we take care of our forests, \" but couldn't recall raking coming up. Trump's comment generated amusement on social media in finland, which manages its vast forests with scientific seriousness.

Sources tell the wall street journal that the inert missile was clearly marked as sensitive cargo when lockheed martin sent it to europe from florida in 2014, but after it was used in a training exercise in spain, it ended up among other cargo on an air france flight from paris to havana when it was supposed to be on a flight from frankfurt, germany, to the us. Cuban officials seized the missile when it arrived and they realized what it was, the journal's sources say. A us official tells the ap that while authorities aren't too worried about cuba reverse-engineering the hellfire to create its own drone-based missile program, they suspect havana may have shared the unexpected find with other countries. According to the journal, american authorities have been asking cuba, without success, to return the dummy missile and have been examining the paper trail in europe to try to determine how it went so badly astray. A federal official says lockheed martin and other companies have been cited for export-control violations in the past. \" this is a complicated business, mistakes are inherent in complicated businesses, \" the official says. \" mistakes are a part of any human endeavor.

        "summary": "Workers constructing a sewer line in east jerusalem last month discovered a 2,000-year-old water-supply system that — think about this — worked fairly well until the last century, livescience reports. The 13-mile long lower aqueduct, which was fed by a spring south of bethlehem and runs through four modern-day jerusalem neighborhoods, was built by kings governing judea and environs from roughly 140 bc to 37 bc. City rulers kept it up over the years, covering the open channel with terra cotta pipe about 500 years ago. It remained a major water-supply source until an electrical water distribution system replaced it roughly 100 years ago, according to the israel antiquities authority. The iaa says it will cover part of the aqueduct \" for the sake of future generations \" and expose parts for access by the general public, discovery reports. Meanwhile, archaeologists are marveling: \" the aqueduct begins at the 'en 'eitam spring, near solomon's pools south of bethlehem, \" says iaa director ya ' akov billig. \" despite its length, it flows along a very gentle downward slope whereby the water level falls just one meter per kilometer of distance. \" the original designers look pretty smart, too, having built the aqueduct in uninhabited areas where jerusalem neighborhoods now exist, the times of israel notes.

Measuring 55 feet long and 16 feet wide, the small trade vessel was stocked with 600 amphorae, or vases, packed with sardines and other fish. Further study of the shipwreck revealed that the ancient roman engineers also had built in a hydraulic system that allowed the ship to carry an aquarium with live fish. Over the years, metal detector enthusiasts, particularly those in the united kingdom, have uncovered archaeological treasures buried beneath the earth. In 2009, 30-year-old nick davies hauled in 10,000 ancient roman coins that he had found inside a clay pot buried in shropshire, u.k.

Quoting from the gospel of st luke in the new testament, he said: \"jesus says ' it would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he be thrown into the sea ', \" because \" where there is deceit, the spirit of god cannot be \". Without directly mentioning corruption within the catholic church, in his sermon he described those involved in corrupt practices as \"whitewashed tombs \", explaining that \"they appear beautiful from the outside, but inside they are full of dead bones and putrefaction. \" he said: \" a life based on corruption is varnished putrefaction. \" his sermon came during his daily morning mass inside casa santa marta, the guest house he has lived in since being elected pontiff in march. On friday, he also condemned corruption, asserting parents who earned through bribes or corrupt practices had \" lost their dignity \", and fed their children \" unclean bread \". He said: \" some of you might say:",

Here are five of the more unusual details of his visit: the visit has spurred one of the largest security operations in us history: the pope's five-day visit has received the rare designation of \" national special security event, \" the washington post reports, and the secret service-led security operation also involves the fbi, coast guard, pentagon, and other agencies. Adding to the challenge: the pontiff's \" proclivity to wade into public crowds, \" and the doubling-up of events. The 70th un general assembly and chinese president xi jinping's state visit are also on the docket. President obama will meet him at the airport: when he arrives at joint base andrews just outside dc, obama will be there to greet him. This is actually a big deal. \" it is a gesture the president has extended to virtually no other foreign visitor, \" observes the new york times. No congressional handshakes: the pope's attendance at thursday's joint session of congress is a \" sold-out \" event, and those members who will be attending have received a \" please behave yourself \" notice co-signed by john boehner, mitch mcconnell, nancy pelosi, and harry reid, the post reports. \" out of respect for the pope's schedule and the expectation of a timely address, we respectfully request that you assist us by refraining from handshakes and conversations along and down the center aisle, \" the memo reads. There's a saintly sticking point: according to social media ( and vocativ ), there's one major sticking point about francis ' visit to dc that's causing a ruckus: his expected canonization tomorrow of junipero serra, a controversial 18th-century missionary who's accused of enslaving and wiping out indigenous native americans and forcing conversions in california. More than 10,000 signatures have already been gathered on a moveon.org petition asking the pope to ditch his sainthood plans. There's a rookie at the social wheel: deesha dyer is the \" rookie \" planning what the new york times calls \" the'super bowl ' of social planning. \" the new white house social secretary, 37, is an ex-hip-hop reporter tasked with organizing not only every detail of obama's visit with pope francis tomorrow, but also the meeting and state dinner with xi later in the week, followed by a presidential appearance at the un in new york.",

The oct. 17 icy bay landslide into taan fiord, which took about a minute, was north america's biggest since the 1980 collapse of mount st. Helens, according to adn. It caused a local tsunami ( up to 100 feet high ) that could have been dangerous if people had actually been around. Alaska's southeast is the \" world's hotspot for these huge rockslides, \" geology and geophysics professor colin stark told a meeting of the american geophysical union earlier this month. Scientists discovered the slide, which had a magnitude of 4.9, via its \" seismic signature, \" the ap reports. The monitoring network includes hundreds of seismographs and atmospheric sensors. \" we're reading the data … in a way that lets us detect the landslides and figure out where they are, \" stark says. Also in october, there was a 45 million ton slide at mount steele in the yukon; and in february 2014, 68 million tons of debris tumbled down alaska's mount la perouse, adn reports. Scientists say fragile rock from developing mountains and retreating glaciers in the region result in a faster erosion rate and more slides, per abc. Some are concerned that the retreating columbia glacier along alaska's south coast may cause a destructive slide closer to towns. ( after ground ice gave way, a canadian lake fell off a cliff. )",

            "Scientists say they've discovered a massive landslide in an uninhabited area of eastern alaska that's the largest detected in north america since the 1980 eruption of mount st. Helens. The oct. 17 slider unleashed 200 million tons of rock down the taan fiord valley onto tyndall glacier in icy bay, according to columbia university's lamont-doherty earth observatory. No one witnessed it, but scientists picked up its \" seismic signature \" with a method of reading patterns they've been honing for six years. \" we're reading the data, processing the data, in a way that lets us detect the landslides and figure out where they are, \" lamont geomorphologist colin stark said tuesday. The landslide had a magnitude of 4.9 and was confirmed by satellite images taken a week later, according to stark. Scientists say the images appear to show tsunami damage along the sides of the fiord. As large as it was, however, the slide was a distant second from the mount st. Helens eruption in washington state that accounted for a 2.5 billion-ton landslide from a flank collapse, he said tuesday. Because of the difference in size, the two debris dumps are not really comparable, but the washington event was included as a frame of reference, stark said. \" this landslide in alaska, in tyndall, was a pretty normal landslide, \" he said. \" but the mount st. Helens was pretty freakish. \" the alaska landslide, whose discovery was announced friday in san francisco at the american geophysical union meeting, occurred in a section of the state that's considered one of the world's most seismically active areas. Lamont scientists say mountains are still developing there and the fragile nature of the rock accounts for a faster erosion rate. Also contributing to the instability at the landslide site, the tyndall glacier has retreated more than 10 miles since the early 1960s, the scientists said. As a result, the weak rock on the valley wall is prone to collapse, they said. Stark was hesitant to link the landslide to climate change, but considers the glacier retreat a factor, saying it would be like removing scaffolding from a building under construction. Despite its magnitude, the landslide went unfelt at the closest inhabited location about 20 miles to the south at the icy bay lodge, a hunting and fishing business.

The recruits — who seem to be getting younger — see the militants as \" the true jihad \" because they have seized territory and are trying to establish an islamic state, a senior official tells the new york times: \" they're saying: ' look at what we are doing, what we're accomplishing. We're the new face. We're not just talking about it. We're doing it. ' \" officials say more than 100 americans have fought with assorted groups in syria in the last three years and they have been identified through intelligence, including social media postings — but authorities often don't become aware of their presence until well after they've arrived in the country. That was the case with douglas mccain, a former minneapolis-area resident who died over the weekend while fighting for isis. A second american from the area has now been identified as having died in the same battle, according to kmsp.

The bbc reports that's code for something much more fascinating than it sounds: succession. Not of the crown, which prince charles will inherit upon his mother's death, but of the role as head of the commonwealth. It has 53 member states — many of them formerly part of the british empire, reports the telegraph, with rwanda most recently joining in 2009 — that are home to 2.4 billion people, but only 15 of them will eventually have charles as their head of state. The commonwealth position is not hereditary, leaving open the possibility that someone else could fill the role, and that's reportedly what a \" high-level group \" will be discussing before appearing at the commonwealth heads of government meeting in april. Queen elizabeth became head of the commonwealth when she was crowned in 1953, but the commonwealth has only been in existence since 1931, and there is no formal process for deciding on a successor. There have been some murmurings in the past about electing what the bbc calls \" a ceremonial leader to improve the organization's democratic credentials. \" the telegraph reports a 2009 diplomatic cable leaked by wikileaks allegedly voiced the concerns of the commonwealth's secretariat director of political affairs with charles assuming the role, saying he \" does not command the same respect \" as his mother. She has been quietly lobbying for her son, whose website expresses his support for the commonwealth and notes he has been to 41 of its countries.

            "George zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot florida teenager trayvon martin 46 days ago, was charged with second-degree murder wednesday, marking a turning point in a case that has provoked nationwide debate over racial profiling. Florida special prosecutor angela b. Corey, who announced the charge in jacksonville, said that \"the search for justice has brought us to this moment. \" zimmerman turned himself in and was brought wednesday evening to the seminole county jail. Criminal justice lawyers said corey faces an uphill battle in persuading a jury to convict zimmerman of second-degree murder.

Archaeologists theorize that the nomadic population of the day then took the larger bones with them — \" portable ancestors for a mobile population, \" as one of the researchers from franklin &amp; marshall college tells the newspaper. The find suggests that \" the dead still played an active and important role in the lives of the living. \" the ritual of the boiling may have been significant in itself, notes io9, citing this passage from the study: \" the reaction produced by adding quicklime to water is a violent one, where heat is produced and gas is released, \" write the researchers. \" this would have been quite an impressive sensory experience, \" and one that may have invoked an \" otherworldly realm. \" those who lived in this region of the andes mountains back then were on the move much of the time, but it appears that the site of the \" mortuary, \" called khonkho wankane, gradually became more and more important because of this end-of-life ritual.

            "Archaeologists working in the titicaca basin have discovered a mortuary used by ancient bolivians to strip the skin from the remains of the dead. It appears they used calcium oxide – a substance more commonly known as quicklime – to to dissolve these bodies down to the bone. The mortuary site, a religious complex known as khonkho wankane, was a space used by ritual specialists to process human remains. Corpses were cut into pieces and then cleaned and curated using the quicklime, which was procured by heating limestone. The quicklime, when exposed to air, covered the bones in calcium carbonate, or lime plaster. By boiling body parts in pots of quicklime, the flesh and fat became easier to remove from the bones. This would have been quite dramatic, and an indelible part of the mortuary ritual itself.

            "Archaeologists working in the titicaca basin have discovered a mortuary used by ancient bolivians to strip the skin from the remains of the dead. It appears they used calcium oxide – a substance more commonly known as quicklime – to to dissolve these bodies down to the bone. The mortuary site, a religious complex known as khonkho wankane, was a space used by ritual specialists to process human remains. Corpses were cut into pieces and then cleaned and curated using the quicklime, which was procured by heating limestone. The quicklime, when exposed to air, covered the bones in calcium carbonate, or lime plaster. By boiling body parts in pots of quicklime, the flesh and fat became easier to remove from the bones. This would have been quite dramatic, and an indelible part of the mortuary ritual itself. As the researchers write in their study: advertisement the reaction produced by adding quicklime to water is a violent one, where heat is produced and gas is released.

They even dug up his yard, but no trace of the woman was ever found. That is, until johnson's daughter, linda evans, who was seven or eight when her mom vanished, decided on a whim to place ads in northern bc newspapers last month asking for information on her long-lost mom, who had links to the north, the surrey leader reports. Not expecting to hear much news about the 52-year-old mystery, she was amazed to find an entirely new family instead. \" the original daughter of lucy johnson, who went above and beyond to promote and try to generate tips all over bc, actually somehow connected with a stepsister, who she did not know she had at the time, \" a police rep explains to the cbc. It turns out johnson, now 77 with another family — including three sons and a daughter — was alive and well in yukon. \" the police phoned me and said ' we found your mom ' and i said ' no, i found my mom, ' \" says evans, who hopes to visit her mom to get some answers.

Bassist jackie fuchs, aka jackie fox, says male band manager kim fowley raped her at a motel party in 1975 when she was just 16. Now 55 and a lawyer, fuchs says an apparent roadie told her to take a quaalude \" no questions asked \" after the runaways performed a new year's eve show in orange county, calif., reports the huffington post in a lengthy profile of the band. Witnesses share their recollection of the moment with huffpo: as fuchs lay unconscious on a bed in a crowded room, fowley took off her clothes, raped her with the handle of a hairbrush, and then had sex with her. \" i remember opening my eyes, kim fowley was raping me, \" fuchs says. She recalls seeing bandmates joan jett and cherie currie watching. \" jackie was dead, dead, dead drunk — like corpse drunk. She was just laying down on her back, sound asleep, out of it, \" says runaways co-founder kari krome, who was 14 at the time, adding fowley sexually assaulted her several times when she was a young, aspiring songwriter. Fowley, who died of cancer in january, maintained he had no inappropriate sexual dealings with the bandmates, reports the guardian. A rep for jett says she denies \" witnessing the event as it has been described. \" however, a witness says jett told him he \" needed to deny being in the motel room that night \" in case fuchs tried to sue when she left the band in 1977.

Ronald gasser, the driver, answered the phone, got into an argument with the man, and followed him to a gas station, where he allegedly attacked him. Assault charges against gasser were dismissed, and according to nbc sports, the sheriff's office isn't sure why. This time, gasser may not even be charged. Police say gasser shot 28-year-old joe mcknight three times thursday without ever getting out of his car. A witness tells the times-picayune that mcknight was trying to apologize when he was shot; she says the shooter shot mcknight again while he was on the ground. Gasser was taken into custody but released without charges. It's unclear if any are coming. Louisiana law makes it legal to kill if you feel threatened, and gasser is claiming self defense.

            "Advertisement continue reading the main story washington — the treasury department is preparing to answer a question that it has dodged and rebuffed for months: if there's not enough money for everyone, who is left empty-handed? officials said wednesday that the department would address the issue later this week unless it became clear that congress would vote by aug. 2 to let the government borrow more money. The outlines of the answer, however, already are clear. Officials have said repeatedly that treasury does not have the legal authority to pay bills based on political, moral or economic considerations. It cannot, for instance, set aside invoices from weapons companies to preserve money for children's programs. The implication is that the government will need to pay bills in the order that they come due. President obama has warned as a result that the government \"cannot guarantee \" payments of social security benefits or other popular programs. Officials also have disputed the assertion of some republicans that the government could prioritize interest payments. Several independent analysts estimate there is enough money on hand to pay the bills until aug. 10. Treasury has declined to provide its own estimate. \"you're basically running on fumes from midnight aug. 2 forward, \" the white house spokesman, jay carney, told reporters wednesday.

As the game ended, the roar from inside the bars and the throng of fans on the streets was deafening. The crowds inside and out sang \" go cubs go \" at the top of their lungs. As the celebration progressed, thousands of fans poured into the streets leading away from wrigley, many of them singing \" we are the champions. \" fans hugged each other, many of them crying. They took each other's picture and pictures of themselves, and took turns writing their names and words of congratulations in chalk on wrigley's brick walls. Some got on friends'shoulders to find spots high up on the walls that were not yet covered with names. An hour after the game ended there were still thousands of people in the ballpark neighborhood, known as wrigleyville, and there were still fireworks exploding every few minutes. \" this was torture, \" said mike delmanowski, a lifelong cubs fan who flew to chicago from california just to be surrounded by other cubs fans. \" i would not have missed it for anything. \" \" i am so proud to be a part of it, \" said his wife, sue, who was crying off and on from the fifth inning. Mike dillon said all he could think about was his father, who died without ever seeing what dillon witnessed. \" i came here by myself, but i ' m not alone at all, \" said mike dillon, 57. Craig and april likhite drove to chicago with their 10-year-old son, cade, because they wanted to see history made with other fans as close to wrigley as possible. \" to finally see this in my lifetime with my son here with us, it means everything, \" craig likhite said. \"",

        "summary": "Omar mateen used facebook before — and even during — the orlando mass shooting, ranting against the west and searching for posts on the massacre, according to a lawmaker's letter to mark zuckerberg. Sen. Ron johnson, gop chair of the homeland security committee, quotes posts including: \" the real muslims will never accept the filthy ways of the west \" and \" you kill innocent women and children by doing us airstrikes... Now taste the islamic state vengeance \" in a letter asking zuckerberg for his assistance investigating the attack, the ap reports. According to johnson, mateen searched facebook for \" pulse orlando \" and \" shooting \" on sunday morning, apparently when the mass shooting was already underway. In other developments: mateen was kicked out of high school in the ninth grade for fighting, according to records seen by the washington post. The records also state that he used marijuana and steroids and had been convicted of a crime, though records do not specify the offense. A student at indian river state college tells nbc news that mateen was rejected from a six-month law enforcement training program last year. Mateen's father, seddique mateen, says he \" worked very hard to put him in the police academy. \" news 13 reports that mateen called the station during the rampage, telling producer matthew gentili, \" i ' m the shooter. It's me. I am the shooter. \" gentili says the caller said he \" did it for isis. \" it's too early to say whether mateen's wife, noor salman, will face charges, the us attorney for the middle district of florida tells the orlando sentinel. Lee bentley promises that \" no stone will be left unturned \" and that \" you will not find a more exhaustive or thorough investigation anywhere else in the united states. \" insiders say salman told federal agents that she tried to talk mateen out of the shooting. The miami herald reports that orlando has opened a center at the citrus bowl stadium to deal with bereaved family members. The city is also bracing for the arrival of anti-gay protesters from the westboro baptist church. The new york times spoke to joshua stephany, orlando's chief medical examiner, who lost count of how many autopsies he performed this week. \" take a typical homicide scene, multiply it by 50, even that just won't prepare you for what you see, \" he says. Stephany says that out of respect for the victims, mateen's body is being kept in a separate area of the morgue that is normally used for decomposing bodies. ( a pulse survivor says mateen",

Instead, breivik went on for 65 minutes and was interrupted four times by a judge who asked him to shorten his 13-page statement. Breivik ranted against liberalism, immigration, and multiculturalism, and compared the norwegian labour party's youth camp that he attacked to the hitler youth, but claimed that he \" lowered the rhetoric out of consideration for the victims. \" excerpts, per the telegraph and the bbc: \" i have done the most sophisticated and spectacular political attack seen in europe since the second world war. \" on the us mccarthy witch hunts: \" mccarthy was far too moderate.

These were not innocent, non-political children, but these were people who actively worked to uphold multicultural values. \" \" i cannot plead guilty.
