        "summary": "The senate judiciary committee has scheduled a hearing thursday for supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh and christine blasey ford, the woman who says he sexually assaulted her as a teenager, as a claim of sexual misconduct emerged from another woman. The new yorker magazine reported sunday night that senate democrats were investigating a second woman's accusation of sexual misconduct by kavanaugh dating to the 1983-84 academic year, kavanaugh's first at yale university. The new yorker said 53-year-old deborah ramirez described the incident in an interview after being contacted by the magazine. Ramirez recalled that kavanaugh exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away, the magazine reported, per the ap. In a statement provided by the white house, kavanaugh said the event \" did not happen \" and that the allegation was \" a smear, plain and simple. \" a white house spokeswoman added in a second statement that the allegation was \" designed to tear down a good man. \" the new information came hours after the senate committee agreed to a date and time for a hearing after nearly a week of uncertainty over whether ford would appear to tell her story. The new yorker reports it reached out to ramirez after learning of the alleged incident, and that she responded after six days of inventorying her memories and speaking with her lawyer. An excerpt from the piece: \" brett was laughing, \" she said. \" i can still see his face, and his hips coming forward, like when you pull up your pants. \" she recalled another male student shouting about the incident. \" somebody yelled down the hall, ' brett kavanaugh just put his penis in debbie's face, ' \" she said. \" it was his full name. I don't think it was just ' brett. ' and i remember hearing and being mortified that this was out there. \"",

( see some of the spelling jokes that ensued here. ) the tweet suggests the president blames the lack of probe on sessions, who last year recused himself from any investigations into russian interference.

The decision upholds the ruling of judge james robart made last friday, which first blocked trump's travel ban. The court bought into the arguments of washington state and minnesota that the ban — even a temporary reinstatement of it — would cause harm to the states, specifically their universities, according to the ap. Reuters reports it was a unanimous ruling of all three judges on the court of appeals. In its ruling, the court found the trump administration failed to show the us would be harmed if the travel ban weren't reinstated. It also didn't completely buy the administration's arguments for why the ban is needed, and ruled that comments by trump and his advisers could be used to determine the intent of the ban, cbs news reports. The court didn't rule on the constitutionality or legality of trump's executive order, only that the suspension of it could be kept in place. Trump responded in a tweet following the ruling: \" see you in court, the security of our nation is at stake! \" the executive order will likely now head to the supreme court, where a 4-4 split is probable.

U.s. District judge stephen friot denied a request for a preliminary injunction that was requested by a group of 21 oklahoma death row inmates who argued the use of the sedative midazolam as the first drug in a three-drug combination the state administers risks subjecting them to unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment.

Lockett's execution was the first in oklahoma using midazolam, which also has been used in problematic executions in ohio and arizona. Arizona meanwhile is scrapping its lethal injection protocol, used in the execution of joseph wood, which lasted nearly two hours and took 15 doses. Officials announced the change monday after a state-commissioned review of the troubling july execution, even as they insisted it was \" handled appropriately. \" the three-drug protocol that arizona now plans to use — midazolam, the paralytic vecuronium bromide and the heart-stopper potassium chloride — is the same combination that oklahoma used in the botched execution of lockett.

According to the chronicle, the median monthly rent in the neighborhood has soared to $ 6,850.

The 12-year-old from williamsburg, va., got to put that advice to good use on saturday when a man tried to carjack the van she and her younger sister were in as their mom tried to assist at the scene of a car accident, wset reports. Maddie's mom was taking her and 7-year-old mollie to busch gardens when they saw a car accident take place. Their mom jumped out to see if she could help, and that's when maddie said a man came out of nowhere, stuck his hand through one of the vehicle's windows to unlock the door, and slipped inside. Maddie says she could think of nothing else \" except he's a psycho and he needs to get out of the car, \" so she leaped into action. First she took advantage of one of the van's safety features: she put the vehicle in drive so the man couldn't start the engine, then started yelling and punching him as mollie fled. Cops intervened and nabbed the suspect, identified as 21-year-old paul salsman. A james city county police department rep says salsman admitted to cops he'd taken lsd and smoked crack cocaine, wydaily.com reports. Police say salsman, who had to be hit with a stun gun twice before being taken into custody, was charged with felony carjacking ( he's accused of trying to steal three vehicles at the scene ), felony hit-and-run, and driving under the influence of drugs. Maddie did break a growth plate in her wrist during her ordeal, but mollie is thankful her big sister took charge. \" it was amazing, \" mollie tells wset.

But the problem may arise from the fda's vague way of dividing synthetic from natural chemicals, says popular science. Lacroix does include those ingredients, but pubchem — a database of chemical compounds by the national institute of health — says they're \" naturally occurring \" from sources like citrus peels, flowers, and plants. What's more, the arguments against them being toxic and cancer-causing appear pretty thin ( yes, there's evidence of limonene causing cancer in rats, but other studies show it inhibits cancer cells in humans ). The fda lists all three ingredients as \" synthetic, \" saying \" natural \" ingredients must be derived from animal or plant sources, yet the three relevant chemicals can be derived naturally. Meanwhile, national beverage — which saw sales spike nearly 13 % in the quarter ending july 28 — says lacroix's flavors \" are derived from the natural essence oils from the named fruit used in each of the flavors. \"",

            "The monoterpene d-limonene is a naturally occurring chemical which is the major component in oil of orange. Currently, d-limonene is widely used as a flavor and fragrance and is listed to be generally recognized as safe ( gras ) in food by the food and drug administration ( 21 cfr 182.60 in the code of federal regulations ). Recently, however, d-limonene has been shown to cause a male rat-specific kidney toxicity referred to as hyaline droplet nephropathy. Furthermore, chronic exposure to d-limonene causes a significant incidence of renal tubular tumors exclusively in male rats. Although d-limonene is not carcinogenic in female rats or male and female mice given much higher dosages, the male rat-specific nephrocarcinogenicity of d-limonene may raise some concern regarding the safety of d-limonene for human consumption. A considerable body of scientific data has indicated that the renal toxicity of d-limonene results from the accumulation of a protein, alpha 2u-globulin, in male rat kidney proximal tuble lysosomes. This protein is synthesized exclusively by adult male rats. Other species, including humans, synthesize proteins that share significant homology with alpha 2u-globulin. However, none of these proteins, including the mouse equivalent of alpha 2u-globulin, can produce this toxicity, indicating a unique specificity for alpha 2u-globulin. With chronic exposure to d-limonene, the hyaline droplet nephropathy progresses and the kidney shows tubular cell necrosis, granular cast formation at the",

        "summary": "Angie samota was raped and murdered in texas in 1984, when she was 20 years old. Twenty years later, her case was still unsolved when her former college roommate, sheila wysocki, saw a vision of samota standing at the edge of her bed. \" i know it sounds crazy, \" wysocki, now 53, tells people in a new interview. The vision prompted the mom of two to take it upon herself to figure out what happened to samota, but it took more than 750 phone calls over four years before the dallas police department found the crime scene evidence it had supposedly lost. That evidence included dna from serial rapist donald bess, who was ultimately convicted of her murder and received a death sentence in 2010. Police initially brushed wysocki off, the washington post reports. So wysocki became a private investigator in the hopes that police would take her more seriously. She assumed she'd retire after samota's murder was solved, but she ended up hearing from so many other people looking for answers in cold cases that she started her own company, without warning private investigation, and has taken on dozens of cases. In the process of helping to solve samota's murder, wysocki helped to clear the names of two men: samota's friend russell buchanan, with whom she had gone out dancing on her last night alive, and samota's boyfriend, at whose home samota stopped by before heading back to her own apartment that night. Police say bess knocked on her door asking to use her restroom and her phone after she got home, and she let him in. She was on the phone with her boyfriend when the line went dead, prompting him to rush to her place and, ultimately, call police when she didn't answer the door. Her body was found inside.

Researchers came upon a copy of the magna carta when seeking a companion document in local archives, the magna carta project reports. Hidden in a scrapbook from the 19th century, the newly discovered document has suffered damage over the centuries and has lost about a third of its text, researchers say. Some 24 editions of the document currently exist, the bbc reports. But this one has special importance: both the magna carta and the partner document, the forest charter, have survived, making them one of only two existing pairs. It could be worth up to $ 15 million. The find comes months ahead of the 800th anniversary of 1215 sealing of the magna carta, which limited the king's power. The sandwich discovery is from 1300, under the reign of edward i, researchers say. There are seven existing copies of the 1300 magna carta, which \" was apparently the last drawn up by the royal chancery and distributed under the king's seal, \" the experts write. The new find sheds further light on the document's distribution: \" it must have been much more widely distributed than previously thought because if sandwich had one... The chances are it went out to a lot of other towns, \" professor nicholas vincent tells the huffington post. \" and it is very likely that there are one or two out there somewhere that no one has spotted yet. \" the find comes as the four surviving original copies of the document are brought together for the first time.",

A giant city floating in the sky? well, according to chinese tv news channels, china recently had a massive metropolis hovering over the clouds that was spotted by thousands of people, the daily express reports. In fact, a similar floating city was seen in jiangxi province just days after one appeared above foshan in the guangdong province. And comparable china sightings go back to 2011, the inquisitr reports. Video of a recent sighting ( available here ) is being interpreted differently by meteorologists, conspiracy theorists, believers in other dimensions, and believers in the power of photoshop. According to meteorologists, such phenomena are caused by a mirage known as fata morgana. These are actually far-off objects like boats that appear as big as buildings when light rays bend while moving through various air temperatures. But some on the internet are pointing to the conspiracy theory that nasa, using \" project blue beam \" technology, will eventually simulate an alien attack or return of jesus christ, the independent reports. \" interesting, \" reads one comment. \" what if it really is a city from a parallel universe? or maybe a glimpse into the future. \" others, however, say the video is a photoshopped hoax.",

Trump described the 1994 agreement that formed the wto as \" the single worst trade deal ever made \" and issued his threat: \" if they don't shape up, i would withdraw from the wto. \" the body sets rules for global trade and serves as a forum for handling trade disputes, and trump complained about the historical outcome of those complaints. He had this to say: \" we rarely won a lawsuit except for last year. In the last year, we're starting to win a lot. You know why? because they know if we don't, i ' m out of there. \" the bbc cites a study that shows the reality is more like 90/90: we win about 90 % of the cases we bring, and lose just shy of 90 % of those filed against us. As for the cases filed against us, ones from china have made recent headlines. The ap reports beijing on monday formally sought \" dispute consultations \" over the latest round of tariffs — $ 16 billion of them — imposed last week on chinese goods. China is a thorn, per us trade representative robert lighthizer, who views china's 2001 entry into the body as a mistake. Bloomberg's take: \" a us withdrawal from the wto potentially would be far more significant for the global economy than even trump's growing trade war with china. \" in the meantime, the us has been blocking the appointment of new judges, which could ultimately put the wto's ability to issue judgments on ice.

        "summary": "Veganism is on the rise in italy, and while it's been shown to be the best diet for weight loss, a few babies who are also on a strict no-animal-products diet appear to be paying a price. A 14-month-old was rushed to a milan hospital this month by his grandparents and found to be so severely malnourished that he weighed what most babies weigh at 3 months, reports the san francisco chronicle. His calcium and iron levels were extremely low, which in turn exacerbated a congenital heart condition for which he had to undergo emergency surgery. And while the surgery was successful and the boy is recovering, a milan court ruled that his parents, who refused to give the baby animal products or dietary supplements, would not be given custody of the child while an investigation is underway. The extraordinary case appears to be growing more common as a 2-year-old was hospitalized in genoa in june for malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies, while an 11-month-old was treated for similar problems in florence last june, reports the washington post. These cases are forcing doctors \" to reflect on uncommon feeding regimes, \" luca bernardo, director of pediatrics at the milan hospital, tells the telegraph. \" it is not a problem to choose different or unusual kinds of nutrition... But since birth, the baby should have had support in this case with calcium and iron. \" media reports estimate that nearly 3 % of italy is now vegan.

It seems that tate's sister, debra tate, who controls her likeness, doesn't think lawrence could pull it off, an opinion that has outraged j-law fans. In a follow-up video at tmz, debra tate explains that while she likes and admires lawrence, \" there's two different kinds of pretty \" and lawrence is apparently the wrong kind in this case. Debra tate says her sister was a \" bombshell \" who was considered to be \" one of the most beautiful women that ever walked the earth, \" and suggests that lawrence isn't in the same league. Tarantino is reportedly also considering margot robbie for the role, and debra tate prefers her, while acknowledging \" it's not my call. \" a post at the revelist thinks debra tate should back off. Her comments are \" mean and unnecessary, \" writes karen nissim. Choosing between lawrence and robbie would be understandably difficult, \" but that doesn't mean the decision should come down to a subjective assessment of their physical beauty. \" at harper's bazaar, amy de klerk finds debra tate's criticism \" puzzling and extremely misguided. \"",

        "summary": "In assam, india, an island is dissolving like a cube of sugar in a cup of the tea for which the region is famous, and a river is to blame. The new york times reports on the fate of majuli, one of the world's largest \" inland islands, \" which is surrounded by the brahmaputra river. Climate change is fueling destructive changes, among them more devastating flooding, but the river itself bears much of the blame: its unique braided shape creates a natural instability, according to some scientists. It also sits in an earthquake-prone area, and was rocked by a massive 1950 quake that rerouted some channels such that they now batter majuli. Says one resident who lost a stand of banana trees to the rising water this month: \" we are afraid. We see it in front of our eyes. Ten years ago, this land stretched out another two kilometers. \" according to one study, that's likely true: it found the island, which is home to 170,000 people, shrunk from 290 square miles in 1917 to 163 square miles in 2001. Once home to 64 monasteries, only 36 remain. Officials have responded to the destruction by building embankments, but a local environmental expert says that might not be enough. \" we need a more holistic and integrated approach, \" he says. Further downstream, scientists worry that the river could displace millions of people in bangladesh within the next few decades. Indian express last month reported that 82 % of the nearly 3,000 miles of embankments and dykes that line brahmaputra and its tributaries in assam are currently beyond their recommended lifespan.",

        "summary": "In the wake of the pulse orlando massacre, many in the lgbt community want to do something to help victims and to remember the dozens of lives lost at the lgbt nightclub — but for many of those looking to help, donating blood is not an option. Though the fda recently lifted the lifetime ban on blood donations from gay and bisexual men, those men must still go a full year without having sex with another man in order to be eligible to donate. This is still, effectively, a \" ban on gay blood, \" and an \" unjustified \" one at that, writes john paul brammer in the guardian. The ban was originally put in place in response to the hiv/aids epidemic, but today, hiv-positive donors can easily be screened out. Other countries have already done away with their own bans, and the american medical association called the us ban discriminatory in 2013. \" it is an outrage that our blood can be spilled but not donated. It is an outrage that, despite the facts and despite calls to lift the ban from experts across the country, homophobia and gay panic keeps it in place, \" brammer writes. He's far from the only one speaking out: cnn and time note the \" outraged \" responses on twitter, with people calling for an end to the ban. The washington post notes that critics of the ban say a waiting period for gay men should be no longer than 30 days, since hiv testing can detect the virus soon after infection. On slate, mark joseph stern writes, \" heterosexual people who have unprotected sex with multiple anonymous partners are permitted to donate at any time. The de facto ban on gay blood donation is utterly unsupported by science and has been abolished by other countries — but the fda remains extraordinarily hesitant to loosen rules on gay blood donation. \"",

The washington post reports that the sinkhole was first spotted last week on the north lawn, yards away from the white house press briefing office and the office of deputy press secretary hogan gidley. Over the last few days, the sinkhole, which groundskeepers have surrounded with caution tape, has expanded and a second one is apparently opening up next to it. The sinkhole could be the result of a leaking old water line eroding space underground, and it doesn't help that much of washington, dc, is built on swampland, forbes notes. Some experts believe the sinkhole could be the result of debris settling from obama-era construction projects. National parks service spokeswoman jenny anzelmo-sarles says the service is keeping a close eye on the situation and is bringing in outside experts to help \" remedy the situation, \" cnn reports. \" sinkholes, like this one, are common occurrences in the washington area following heavy rain like the dc metro area has experienced in the last week, \" she says. \" we do not believe it poses any risk to the white house or is representative of a larger problem. \" ( a year ago, a sinkhole opened up in front of trump's mar-a-lago estate. )",

        "summary": "A new british study offers a stark picture of the future of the country's health: about half the population, researchers find, will develop cancer during their lifetimes. \" cancer is primarily a disease of old age, with more than 60 % of all cases diagnosed in people aged over 65, \" study author peter sasieni says in a press release. \" if people live long enough, then most will get cancer at some point. \" the figure applies to people born after 1960. But sasieni offers an even bleaker assessment for younger people: he informally estimates in the telegraph that \" probably we would be talking about two in three … of today's children getting cancer if we don't do anything. \" still, there's good news. For one thing, the rate of survival of the disease has doubled in the uk in the past four decades; about one in two who develop cancer survive it for at least 10 years, the press release notes. What's more, \" there's a lot we can do to make ( developing the illness ) less likely — like giving up smoking, being more active, drinking less alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight, \" sasieni says. Adds another expert: \" growing older is the biggest risk factor for most cancers, and it's something we can't avoid. But more than four in 10 cancers diagnosed each year in the uk could be prevented by changes in lifestyle — that's something we can all aim for personally so that we can stack the odds in our favor. \" ( in more upbeat news, another recent study suggests that within decades, cancer will kill hardly anyone under age 80. )",

            "Two in three of those born today are likely to develop cancer, experts have warned, after drawing up stark new scientific forecasts. The estimates from cancer research uk suggest over half of adults born since 1960 can expect to suffer the disease in their lifetime, with study authors warning that the figure will rise in future generations. Experts said the new statistic – replacing previous estimates of one in three - is the most accurate forecast to date. Much of the rise is explained by increasing life expectancy, and the fact that cancer is much more common in old age. However, researchers warned that around one third of the increase is fuelled by lifestyle factors such as alcohol, smoking, rising obesity and changes in child-bearing patterns. The forecasts, published in the british journal of cancer, say that men born after 1960 have a 53.5 per cent lifetime risk of cancer, compared to a risk of 38.5 per cent among those born three decades before. For women, the risk has risen from 36.7 per cent to 47.5 per cent, the figures show, with an overall risk of 50.5 per cent across both genders. Researchers said that if life expectancy continues to increase, but lifestyle habits do not improve, the vast majority of children can expect to develop cancer in their lifetimes.

Prevention must also play an important role in the concerted effort required to reduce the impact of the disease in coming decades. Thanks to research, the uk's cancer survival has doubled over the last 40 years and around half of patients now survive the disease for more than 10 years. But, as more people benefit from improved healthcare and longer life expectancy, the number of cancer cases is expected to rise. This new research estimating lifetime risk finds that, from now on*, 1 in 2 people will be diagnosed with the disease. This new estimate replaces the previous figure, calculated using a different method, which predicted that more than 1 in 3 people would develop cancer at some point in their lives. Age is the biggest risk factor for most cancers, and the increase in lifetime risk is primarily because more people are surviving into old age, when cancer is more common. Study author"

In the agency's latest findings, there were nearly 20,000 syphilis cases in 2014 ( a 15 % rise from 2013, and the highest rate since 1994 ), including 458 cases in newborns — a 27.5 % increase from the year before. On the gonorrhea front, 350,000 cases were reported in 2014 ( a 5 % increase ), while chlamydia racked up 1.4 million cases in 2014, which is the highest number of cases of any disease ever reported to the cdc. But while young people and women usually end up being most affected, there's another group that doctors are now keeping an eye on. \" we are concerned that most of the surging rates are among men, \" says the director of the cdc's std prevention division, per healthday news. \" men are driving these increases. \" so what's the root of this surge? slashed budgets for state and local std initiatives, for one, meaning clinic closings or reduced hours and increased fees and copays, nbc notes. Another contributor is a change in sexual behavior, especially among gay and bisexual men, based on advances in hiv treatment: because drugs for the virus are so effective, people have let down their guard and stopped wearing condoms as much — but condoms are still needed to prevent stds like syphilis and gonorrhea. \" america's worsening std epidemic is a clear call for better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, \" a cdc doctor tells the ap. For policymakers wary of prevention programs ' costs, an american sexual health association rep makes another crucial point, per healthday news: stds run up a $ 16 billion bill each year.

Today, the girls'remains are the oldest in the north american arctic, smithsonian reports. Archaeologists recently discovered their grave in a hearth — the girls were wrapped and covered in red ochre — at the upward sun river site, which has opened what one archaeologist calls \" new windows \" into the life and burial practices of people at the end of the ice age. That's because the girls were found underneath a later burial — the cremated remains of a 3-year-old girl. The difference in treatment may suggest the people at upward sun river had complex funerary practices, perhaps burying their dead differently based on age or time of year. In the newly excavated grave, archaeologists also found a \" hunter's toolkit \" of antler foreshafts and sharpened stones — the first evidence of their use together, adds livescience — and critical materials for the nomadic hunters. That they were left in the grave \" bespeaks of the deep sense of loss and sorrow these people must have felt at the loss of their children, \" one researcher tells smithsonian. And the deaths of three children, so close together and likely to the same mother, suggests a hard life for ice age people. \" they suffered losses along the way in their quest to colonize the americas, \" says an archaeologist not involved with the dig. Scientists will now study the girls'dna to unearth a link between similar graves in montana and siberia, on the other side of the land bridge.

        "summary": "At least 82 dolphins, including juveniles and calves, have died in a mysterious incident in a remote section of florida's everglades national park. Officials say 95 dolphins — a particular species known as false killer whales, which typically swim at depths of 3,000 feet — were seen stranded in the area beginning saturday, and at least 72 died on their own. Another 10 were euthanized, reports reuters. Officials are still trying to determine what happened to another 13 dolphins, but \" i wouldn't be overly optimistic that they're still alive at this point, \" erin fougeres, an noaa marine biologist, tells popular science. \" they were high and dry on very wide mudflats and trapped in mangroves, \" she adds, per nbc miami. A response team tried to herd the dolphins to deep water but were unsuccessful, an official says. It isn't clear what led to the stranding, but the animals are known to strand in large groups. Two such strandings were reported in florida in the 1980s, but never involving more than 40 dolphins, per nbc miami. This case is \" the largest mass stranding we've had of this species in the us, \" fougeres says, though 835 false killer whales were stranded in argentina in 1946. Necropsies are being conducted in the hope that they ' ll provide clues, but a coast guard captain presents one theory: \" i think they were just cruising along, the tide dropped out, and they found themselves on the beach, \" he tells wbbh.",

After receiving the tip, the fbi interviewed tsarnaev and searched its databases before quickly closing the case; tsarnaev returned to dagestan for an extended trip the following year — a trip that has become a \" key thread \" in the bombing investigation. The fbi's 2011 moves are now being heavily scrutinized, but the fbi shouldn't be expected to aggressively pursue every tip from russia's fsb security service, current and former security officials tell the daily beast. The service has been criticized for being used as a tool to attack the russian regime's political opponents, and there doesn't seem to have been any indication that tsarnaev posed a threat to the us. \" the fsb is mad at a lot of chechens, \" says former cia director michael hayden. \" not all of them are terrorists, and even fewer of them are dangerous to the united states. \"",

The doomed la belle was france's last hope to settle texas and the american southwest, and explorer robert la salle the man hired for the job. In 1685, he arrived with four ships and 300 colonists to settle the mouth of the mississippi — which he overshot by about 400 miles. One ship was lost to pirates, another sank, and a third went home, the bullock museum's curator jim bruseth tells the battalion. The la belle remained, docked with a new colony at fort st. Louis on the texas coast while la salle searched for the elusive river. The frigate sunk in a storm, the colony crumbled, and la salle was killed. Though it failed, fort st. Louis lured the spanish, who swiped the region from the french. \" history oftentimes turns on seemingly small events, \" bruseth tells the ap. La belle was found in 1995, shipped in pieces to texas a&m, stored in a freezer, and taken piece by piece to the austin museum. Archaeologists will now reassemble the frigate inside the museum for visitors, then encase it in glass. \" once we get the framing up it's going to look like a big beached whale, a bone carcass, \" says one archaeologist.

Gerow, then about 20 years old, left nashua for arizona with john kalhauser, who had already been convicted of manslaughter nine years earlier in a man's shooting death, the lowell sun reports. And the year before he moved to arizona with gerow, he was also indicted for armed assault with intent to murder in connection to another shooting, this one of his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend. Kalhauser was out on bail when he left for arizona. \" we think she ran off, we don't know, \" gerow's father tells the ap. \" my daughter was just gone and we have no idea why. I don't know what happened. Thirty-three years and still no reason why. \" gerow's brother tells the new hampshire union leader his sister was a free spirit who met kalhauser at a nightclub. In 1995, kalhauser's ex-wife disappeared from arizona and kalhauser ( who had been using an alias ) was arrested in connection with the 1979 incident. In 1996, he was convicted of armed assault with intent to murder in that incident; in 1999, he was convicted of second-degree murder in connection with his ex-wife's disappearance, though her body was never found. When kalhauser was picked up in 1995, he had a photograph of a woman with him; in 2012, when investigators decided to exhume the body they found in arizona in 1981 and reconstruct her face so that they could test evidence with new technology, wmur reports, they matched her face up with the photo kalhauser had been carrying. In 2014, they posted both images on social media, and tips ultimately led them to identify the woman as gerow. Kalhauser is now considered a person of interest in her death, and the investigation continues.",

The plane was on the offense against japanese installations at hansa bay when it was hit, and a service member in another plane said he saw five parachutes open and drop to the ground, where \" we could see two of the men moving about. \" they couldn't find their comrades, though, and natives later told the australian military that four of the men had survived, then been taken away by the japanese and either died from their injuries or were brutally murdered. Long gave up thinking her father would be found, but a nonprofit group joined up with the army and started searching for cold-case wwii crashes. Near where her dad's plane had gone down, search teams found coins, ammo, belt buckles — and soldier remains, some of which had dna that matched young's sister.

Kara tippetts, 38, a pastor's wife and mother of four in colorado springs, colo., was admitted in december to hospice care, the washington post had earlier reported. \" i grieve as i watch her fade, \" wrote her husband jason. \" the peace that is in our house is amazing, peace in the midst of tears, peace in the midst of impending loss, but it is peace. \" diagnosed with stage four breast cancer two years ago, tippetts made a stir with her open letter to brittany maynard, the 29-year-old who took her own life rather than suffer what she called \" a terrible \" death by stage four glioblastoma. In her letter, tippets wrote: \" dear heart, we simply disagree. Suffering is not the absence of goodness, it is not the absence of beauty, but perhaps it can be the place where true beauty can be known. In your choosing your own death, you are robbing those that love you with... Such tenderness, the opportunity of meeting you in your last moments and extending you love in your last breaths. \" in a blog post titled \" homecoming, \" tippetts is recalled as \" an extrovert with a big, warm personality... [ who ] never hesitated to share a smile and a kind word. Her personality was magnetic, attracting people of all kinds, and she treated each friend as though they were her very favorite. \" she is survived by husband jason; her children eleanor grace, harper joy, lake edward, and story jane; and \" countless other \" family members and friends. One of those friends, a producer, has raised more than $ 15,000 to make a documentary about her ordeal. See the trailer here, or why the \" right to die \" debate is personal for an npr host.",

And giving homeless people legal strikes against them can make it harder for them to find jobs or housing in the future.

A compromise version of legislation allowing it to do so cleared the senate foreign relations committee with support from both parties this afternoon. In fact, it passed 19-0, and it's expected to easily pass in the full senate. President obama previously had threatened a veto, but the white house said just prior to the bill's passage in committee that he would sign the measure because of changes that were made, reports the hill.

        "summary": "Rebel wilson told a courtroom wednesday that she's not a \" glamorous actress \" like other australian exports such as nicole kidman or cate blanchett, and thus had to work harder to make her name in hollywood. She's now alleging that all her hard work was nearly thrown away when a magazine falsely suggested she'd invented much of her life story, reports 9news. During the third day of a defamation trial in a melbourne court, wilson said the publisher of women's day, bauer media, printed stories in 2015 suggesting she'd lied about everything from her real name to a malaria diagnosis. Wilson, 37, says she lost a role in kung fu panda 3 and had her role reduced in 2016's how to be single after the magazine printed easily disprovable lies told by a \" jealous \" and \" obsessed \" former classmate, reports the sydney morning herald. Wilson broke into sobs at times, though she declined the judge's offer of a break to compose herself. Emails between the anonymous source and magazine writer shari nementzik were read in court, including some in which nementzik expresses doubts about her source's claims. The magazine opted not to go with the story in 2013 on the advice of lawyers, but ran it in 2015 as wilson's pitch perfect 2 was being released. Wilson said she developed a stress sore on her face that meant several of her scenes had to be cut from how to be single. Stress related to the articles — discussed on shows like entertainment tonight, per the guardian — led to other health problems as well, she told the court. Bauer media contends the articles were not defamatory. The trial is expected to last three weeks. ( check out wilson's april fool's prank on set. )",

        "summary": "The archbishop of canterbury just found out that, rather than being conceived in marriage, he is the product of a \" liaison \" his mother had with winston churchill's private secretary. But the revelation hasn't been too much of a shake-up for the most reverend justin welby. \" there is no existential crisis. My identity is founded in who i am in christ, \" he tells the telegraph, which had collected evidence that put welby's father as the late anthony montague browne and not, as believed, gavin welby. The 60-year-old archbishop agreed to end the speculation by providing an oral swab for a dna test. Dna for montague browne, who died in 2013, came from hair taken from a brush kept by his widow. The result: there is a 99.98 % probability that montague browne and welby are father and son. In a statement, per the guardian, welby's mom, 86-year-old lady williams of elvel ( formerly jane welby ) confirmed the affair with montague browne, but she said the news that he fathered her son was a surprise, saying neither she nor gavin welby \" ever doubted that we were the parents of our son justin. \" justin welby, who has gained a half-sister, characterizes the circumstances as \" a story of redemption and hope. \" his mother has been a recovering alcoholic since 1968. She says she began boozing to cope with stress during her tumultuous marriage to the heavy-drinking senior welby. \" i know that i find who i am in jesus christ, not in genetics, and my identity in him never changes, \" the archbishop tells the telegraph. The news raised a momentary question as to whether he could retain his position, as for centuries, men born illegitimately could not be archbishops in the church of england. That prohibition, however, was reversed in the 1950s.",

According to an email he wrote to the class, excerpted at gawker via inside higher ed, he \" will no longer be teaching the course, and all are being awarded a failing grade. \" he writes that he is \" frankly and completely disgusted. You all lack the honor and maturity to live up to the standards that texas a&m holds, and the competence and/or desire to do the quality work necessary to pass the course. \" the department head is taking over teaching the course, click2houston notes, and a university official says the fs are far from a settled matter. \" none of them have failed until the end of the class, meaning the only reason a student would fail [ is ] because he or she has not performed the expectations for that particular class. \" ( this professor was accused of teaching the wrong course for an entire semester. )",

As expected, obama also named sylvia mathews burwell, currently the white house budget director, as his nominee to replace sebelius. \" when the government was forced to shut down last october, and even as her own team was barred from reporting to work, sylvia was a rock, a steady hand on the wheel who helped navigate the country through a very challenging time, \" obama said. He made a joking reference to her 96-0 confirmation last year to her current post, while mitch mcconnell suggested things wouldn't be as easy this time around, reports the wall street journal. She \" will be nominated to lead one of the most important jobs in government, \" mcconnell said. \" and i hope this is the start of a candid conversation about obamacare's shortcomings and the need to protect medicare for today's seniors, their children, and their grandchildren. \"",

The teen's tweet had racked up some 30,000 retweets before she shuttered the account. Some people on facebook even posted to the cvs pharmacy page wondering why the company employed her, reports the san antonio express-news. \" are you aware that you have an illegal alien working for you and bragging on twitter about being undocumented! \" wrote one woman.

Poster added that carlson's death was even more devastating because he was the first newport beach lifeguard to die in the line of duty — over a span of time stretching some 100 years. \" it's a brotherhood that's very difficult to describe, \" poster said. Carlson \" will be given all the honor and respect that comes with losing a member of that brotherhood. \" ( also in california, a swimmer was bit by a great white on saturday. )",

Graves was implicated in the crime by robert carter, who was also charged and ultimately convicted and put to death in 2000. But two weeks before his death, carter recanted, with the houston chronicle noting that he reiterated graves ' innocence while in the execution chamber, saying \" i lied on him in court. \" after fighting for nearly two decades ( during which he spent 12 years on death row and had two execution dates scheduled ), graves was finally exonerated and set free in 2010 — and now, the 48-year-old has filed a complaint with the state bar of texas against the prosecutor who convicted him, the los angeles times reports. Former district attorney charles sebesta, 73, faces disbarment if he is found to have committed misconduct, the texas tribune reports. Graves ' conviction was initially overturned by an appeals court in 2006, after the court found that sebesta withheld evidence that would have benefited graves and pushed witnesses to commit perjury. The new da ( sebesta retired in 2000 ) dismissed graves ' charges and let him go, and two years ago, the texas district and county attorneys association issued a report declaring that errors in the case raised \" serious questions about prosecutor misconduct. \" graves first filed a grievance against sebesta in 2007, but it was dismissed because the statute of limitations had run out; after state lawmakers extended the deadline for filing this year, graves was able to file again.",

According to pew research, millennials officially overtook baby boomers to become the biggest generation in the us this month. Numbers released by the us census bureau show there are now 75.4 million millennials ( born 1981 to 1997 ) and 74.9 million baby boomers ( born 1946 to 1964 ) in the country. The millennial generation is receiving a major boost from young immigrants arriving in the us. A 2014 white house report found 15 % of us residents between the ages of 20 and 34 were born someplace else, the washington post reports. The millennial generation is projected to peak in 2036 with 81.1 million members — 2.3 million more than the baby boomer generation had at its peak in 1999. The post reports millennials, who were already the largest workforce in the us, could soon start having an even bigger impact on the us politically and economically. So let's get to know them a bit: millennials are too lazy to eat cereal, and they may be responsible for a shortage in chefs. They've also been known to rent mothers hourly. And any baby boomers feeling blue about suddenly being outnumbered can take some solace in the fact that they've had sex with more people. Meanwhile, the flannel-clad grunge-heads of generation x aren't projected to surpass the baby boomer population for another dozen years.",

This can be lifesaving, and similarly, the researchers saw in the lab that sample uterine tissue reacts to the repetitive dip in oxygen and blood supply of preceding contractions by triggering what the liverpool researchers are calling \" hypoxia-induced force increase ( hifi ), \" they report in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. And once the hifi mechanism is triggered, it can last for hours, which may seem like cruel torture to the women in labor but could be protective. \" this uterine trigger could be key to resolving issues of prolonged labor, as well as the increasing number of births that result in emergency caesarean, \" wray says.

            "This week, the city of allahabad in northern india kicks off the kumbh mela, a 48-day hindu festival that is expected to be the largest human gathering in history. In addition to the more-than 30 million pilgrims descending upon the flood plain of the yamuna and ganges rivers, the kumbh will host a team of harvard researchers in what is likely the school's more inter-disciplinary project ever. I will be traveling among them, assisting a team of emergency physicians and praying against stampedes. The kumbh mela, which historically has received little press in the west, takes place every four years, and gains special significance every 12. This year, 2013, will be that 12th year — called the purna ( \"complete \" ) kumbh and officials expect somewhere between 30 million and 60 million ascetics and pilgrims to travel to holy sites to bathe. It is believed that during this auspicious astrological moment, the waters of the ganges have the ability to wash away layer upon layer of karmic debt. Some will splash and play in the water like ecstatic children, living on the river bank for a month, while others will perform the perfunctory dip and be on their way.

After acknowledging that it might have been \" prudent \" for the trio to \" head off any overreactions by letting people know what you're doing, \" salon columnist and pilot patrick smith was left with one question: \"what the heck is the matter with us? \" the crew's reaction wasn't one of caution; it looks like \" full-blown hysteria. \" don't believe him? here's a partial list of ridiculous freakouts since the 9/11 attacks: in january, a passenger was detained over a \"suspicious \" carry-on bag that contained … a bagel. In 2006, a delta plane made an emergency landing because a passenger spent too long in the bathroom. In 2004, a united airlines 747 jettisoned thousands of gallons of fuel and reversed course because a barf bag was found in the bathroom with the letters \"bob \" scribbled on it — which for some bizarre reason united concluded meant \"bomb on board. \" in 2002, the military scrambled fighter jets when some karaoke singers on an air-india flight chatted excitedly and pointed out their window at new york. \"passengers are notorious for losing their minds in and around airplanes, \" smith writes. But crews \"have less of an excuse, and there is nothing in our books or protocols that says we have to respond foolishly to every mildly peculiar situation. \" click to read his full list.",

Passengers described scenes of terror inside the cabin as the plane briefly became airborne before hitting the runway again and grinding to a halt, with plumes of smoke visible through the windows. \" the flight kind of shot up and then bounced down, \" one passenger tells the philadelphia inquirer. \" bounced real hard, \" he says. \" shot up again, and then nose-dived. \" but the worst part of the ordeal, he says, was waiting 30 to 40 minutes in the cold for a bus to take passengers back to the terminal.",

        "summary": "If a patent secured by boeing this week is any indication, the company is eyeing a major change in the way travelers fly. The seattle times reports the patent details a passenger plane that takes off and lands vertically like a helicopter via tilting rotors. The rotors — horizontal for takeoff and landing — rotate to become propellers during flight. Boeing was one of two developers behind the military's similar v-22 osprey, which went into service in 2007. However, the osprey can only carry up to 24 soldiers. And a prototype for a commercial plane that takes off and lands vertically from bell — the other developer of the osprey — can only carry nine passengers, according to business insider. Boeing's patent calls for a plane that carries 100 passengers. There are other major differences between the osprey and the plane shown in boeing's patent. Boeing's plane would have four engines housed in its wings instead of two engines housed in the tilt-rotors themselves. This means less structural reinforcement is necessary. The wings are also positioned lower than the osprey's, closer to a traditional commercial plane's, in order to make maintenance and fueling easier. A passenger plane that takes off and lands like a helicopter could allow for more regional commercial flights to leave from small airfields, new atlas reports. But it's unclear if boeing actually plans to build the new plane. \" boeing files tons of patents, so this might not even come to fruition, \" a boeing spokesperson tells business insider. \" i ' m not saying it won't. \" ( the design could have saved mike pence a scare last week. )",

        "summary": "A baby dolphin that beached itself on the shores of mojacar in southeastern spain was quickly surrounded by a mob of curious beachgoers, many out for a good selfie, reports newsweek. The calf was likely sick or had become separated from its mother, and someone called the local emergency number. But by the time equinac — a local nonprofit dedicated to helping stranded marine wildlife — arrived 15 minutes later, the dolphin was dead, reports people. Equinac posted an emotional plea on facebook imploring onlookers to never forcefully touch an already stressed animal, noting that the baby dolphin was touched by many, had its blowhole covered repeatedly, and quickly died of heart failure. \" once again we note that the human being is the most irrational species that exists, \" the post reads. \" there are many [ who are ] incapable of empathy for a living being that is alone, scared, starved, without his mother and terrified.... All you want to do is to photograph and poke, even if the animal suffers from stress. \" another baby dolphin suffered a similar fate in argentina last year after being passed around for selfies, reports the washington post, triggering a round of public shaming. But \" hundreds \" of people surrounded the dolphin in spain, and equinac warned that people disturbing and harming these highly protected animals may be a criminal offense. ( dolphins appear to chat much like humans. )",

            "A dead baby dolphin displayed by a member of equinac in mojacar, southern spain. ( courtesy equinac via afp/getty images ) a baby dolphin died last week after \"hundreds \" of beachgoers in southern spain surrounded the animal to touch and take pictures with it, sparking condemnation from a local animal rescue group. The incident took place last friday in mojácar, on the country's southeastern coast, according to equinac, a spanish nonprofit organization that advocates for marine wildlife. According to several posts on the group's facebook page, a baby dolphin that was stranded on the beach was quickly surrounded by numerous \"curious \" people, including children, who wanted to touch and photograph it. Some accidentally covered the dolphin's spiracle, the blowhole the animals use to breathe, the group said. One concerned person reported the stranded animal to 112, the country's emergency services number, but by the time equinac rescuers arrived at the beach, the dolphin was dead, the group said. \"once again we note that the human being is the most irrational species that exists, \" equinac wrote on facebook aug. 11, the day of the incident, blasting the \"selfishness \" of those that had swarmed the animal. \"there are many [ who are ] incapable of empathy for a living being that is alone, scared,",
            "A baby dolphin has died on a beach in southern spain after a crowd of enthusiastic onlookers touched and photographed it, according to an animal rescue group. According to a series of posts on the facebook page of animal charity equinac, the young dolphin became stranded on the beach in mojácar in the far south-east of the country, and was quickly surrounded by \"hundreds \" of excitable people. A concerned citizen called spain's animal emergency services number 112, who notified equinac. But the dolphin had died by the time rescuers arrived 15 minutes later. The animal charity's post warns that dolphins are \"very susceptible to stress, \" and that touching or taking pictures of the animals will cause a \"strong shock \" that can exacerbate an already dangerous situation for a cub that has lost its mother. Hitting out at those who crowded the terrified animal, equinac's post says: \"the human being is the most irrational species that exists. \"there are many [ people who are ] incapable of empathy for a living being alone, scared, starved, without his mother and terrified. Many of you, in your selfishness, all you want is to photograph and poke, even if the animal suffers from stress. \" the charity says anyone who encounters an animal in such a situation should call 112 rather than disturbing it."
