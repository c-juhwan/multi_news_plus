        "summary": "A non-profit grocery store opened in boston yesterday with an interesting premise: collect food that would otherwise go to waste because it was near its sell-by date and sell it to people at low prices. Daily table, the brainchild of former trader joe's chief doug rauch, opened its doors in the dorchester neighborhood, specializing mostly in food donated by wholesalers and markets, npr reports. While the food isn't as fresh as the stuff you might find at other grocery stores and might have blemishes, it's safe to eat and is sold at cost or with a small mark-up to cover the costs of labor, rent, food, trucking, and storage. A sample of the bargains: a dozen eggs cost $ 1.19, potatoes are 49 cents a pound, a block of cheese runs $ 1.99, and a box of cereal could sell as low as 79 cents, per the boston globe. And you won't find any soda or candy, reports supermarket news. One customer, who appeared to buy enough food for his family for a week, paid just $ 30.46, notes npr. Daily table also puts out healthy meals prepared in the supermarket's kitchen, with entrees like chili and pasta starting at $ 1.79 and side dishes from 50 cents, to compete with fast-food prices, per time. \" the recipes have to change every day because the donations change every day, \" says head chef ismail samad, who previously worked at the michelin-starred restaurant aureole. \" the top of the kale might be getting a little light green. We cut that off and sauté it up. \" if this location is successful, racuh plans to expand to cities across the country, including detroit, los angeles, new york, and san francisco. ( the nation's no. 1 organic grocer is a new surprise. )",

            "On thursday, june 4, a new not-for-profit grocery store called the daily table opened in dorchester, mass. The new store is notable for two main reasons: 1 ) it's the baby of doug rauch, the former president of trader joe's, which was recently named among america's favorite supermarkets; and 2 ) the prices of many items are incredibly affordable.

It's the working poor who are out buying food, but who can't afford the food they should be eating. \" the goal is not only to offer affordable groceries in poor communities like dorchester, but also to sell healthy ready-to-cook meals and hot grab-and-go items at prices that",

But unlike whole foods and star market, the new business isn't built on profit margins or sales growth. Daily table bills itself as the first not-for-profit grocery store in the country with a mission to provide nutritious and affordable meals for low-income families. The store is expected to open soon, pending final permits. Advertisement the current planned prices — $ 1.19 for a dozen eggs, $ 1.99 for a block of cheddar cheese and 55 cents for a can of tuna — are considerably lower than the cheapest alternatives at traditional supermarkets. The store can offer lower prices because it sources surplus foods or goods nearing their \"sell-by \" dates from farmers, supermarkets, manufacturers, and food distributors, who would rather donate or sell their products at steep discounts than toss them in the trash.

Then the kickoff of the awards, with jennifer lopez presenting the first honor of the night for best new artist, awarded to chance the rapper. Lopez offered a statement about the current political climate, quoting toni morrison and noting, \" this is precisely the time when artists get to work. \" the rest of the awards: daft punk helped out with the night's first song by the weeknd, performing the electronica-infused, laser-lit \" i feel it coming. \" a blinged-out john travolta revealed he couldn't read the teleprompter from where he was standing, whipping out his personal cue cards instead to introduce a spunky keith urban and carrie underwood dueting on \" the fighter. \" nick jonas handed out the best pop duo/group performance to twenty one pilots — who took off their pants before taking to the stage to fulfill a promise made long ago — for their hit \" stressed out. \" which, of course, led to corden stripping to his skivvies from the bottom down before introducing ed sheeran, who performed a sexy, stripped-down \" shape of you. \" best rock song went next to the late david bowie for \" blackstar. \" ryan seacrest introduced nominees lukas graham and kelsea ballerini performing a seamless mashup of their songs \" 7 years \" and \" peter pan, \" respectively. Tina knowles, beyonce's mom, welcomed her daughter to the stage with \" a mother's pride, \" where the gold-adorned star — who recently announced she's pregnant with twins with husband jay z — flaunted her baby-bearing belly as she offered quietly powerful renditions of \" love drought \" and \" sandcastles \" from lemonade. Her husband and daughter, blue ivy, beamed from the audience. Maren morris took home the gilded gramophone for best country solo performance for \" my church. \" corden couldn't resist slipping in some of his carpool karaoke schtick, pulling j. Lo, faith hill, tim mcgraw, john legend, keith urban, and neil diamond, among others, into a fake car to sing diamond's \" sweet caroline. \" even blue ivy snuck into the car at the end.

Magritte's the enchanted pose was part of a 1927 exhibition, but no one purchased it, and it was returned to magritte. Since 1932, its whereabouts have been unknown, leaving behind only a single black-and-white photograph as evidence. In 2013, two pieces of the enchanted pose — which shows two nude women standing next to each other — were discovered hidden beneath other magritte paintings in the us and sweden. The discovery of the third piece, the lower right corner, was announced thursday. The new piece of the enchanted pose was discovered by art conservator alice tavares da silva, who was inspecting a magritte painting called the human condition before it was loaned out to another museum. She discovered paint on the side of the canvas under the frame that didn't match the painting itself. Artnet news reports it's rare for a magritte work to have paint on the edges. An x-ray of the human condition revealed it was painted over a piece of the enchanted pose. Tavares da silva calls it a \" hugely exciting discovery. \" according to the norfolk eastern daily press, it now appears magritte cut the enchanted pose into four equal pieces for unknown reasons, then painted over them.

Hirsh, who had been national editor of politico magazine, wrote a facebook post on tuesday that read, \" stop whining about richard b. Spencer, nazi, and exercise your rights as decent americans. Here are his two addresses.... \" spencer is a leader of the white nationalist movement and president of the national policy institute, a white nationalist think-tank. He organized a conference of white supremacists last weekend in washington, d.c., that drew national attention after a video showed people in attendance celebrating president-elect donald trump with nazi salutes. In a statement, politico editor-in-chief john harris and editor carrie budoff brown called hirsh's post indefensible. His actions \" were clearly outside the bounds of acceptable discourse, and politico editors regard them as a serious lapse of newsroom standards, \" they said. \" they crossed a line in ways that the publication will not defend, and editors are taking steps to ensure that such a lapse does not occur again. \" hirsh resigned on tuesday afternoon, within hours of posting the addresses. His post and resignation were first reported by the daily caller. Hirsh is not the only journalist who has posted the address of a private citizen in a way that might lead to problems for that person, though different news organizations have taken different approaches to such breaches of conduct.

Hirsh, who had been national editor of politico magazine, wrote a facebook post on tuesday that read, \" stop whining about richard b. Spencer, nazi, and exercise your rights as decent americans. Here are his two addresses.... \" spencer is a leader of the white nationalist movement and president of the national policy institute, a white nationalist think-tank. He organized a conference of white supremacists last weekend in washington, d.c., that drew national attention after a video showed people in attendance celebrating president-elect donald trump with nazi salutes. In a statement, politico editor-in-chief john harris and editor carrie budoff brown called hirsh's post indefensible. His actions \" were clearly outside the bounds of acceptable discourse, and politico editors regard them as a serious lapse of newsroom standards, \" they said. \" they crossed a line in ways that the publication will not defend, and editors are taking steps to ensure that such a lapse does not occur again. \" hirsh resigned on tuesday afternoon, within hours of posting the addresses. His post and resignation were first reported by the daily caller. Hirsh is not the only journalist who has posted the address of a private citizen in a way that might lead to problems for that person, though different news organizations have taken different approaches to such breaches of conduct.

( photo: women on $ 20s ) washington — women's rights groups, internet activists and members of congress wanted a woman to replace andrew jackson on the $ 20 bill — preferably by harriet tubman. What they got was not quite what they wanted, but no less historic: a yet-to-be-named woman will appear on the $ 10 bill — not in place of alexander hamilton but perhaps beside him. That's progress, said the women on 20s campaign, an online activist group that sprung up last year. But it's \" not perfect. \" \" we would love to see a woman not have to share her glory, and her opportunity to be recognized and honored, \" said susan ades stone, the executive director of the campaign. \" and alexander hamilton is not someone that people",
            "On wednesday afternoon, barbara ortiz howard, who owns an exterior-restoration business in mount vernon, new york, and susan ades stone, a journalist and howard's friend, were asked to join a call with some government officials. In march, howard and ades stone had started a campaign to demand that the u.s. Government replace andrew jackson's image on the twenty-dollar bill with a woman from history. Their goal was to have this happen by 2020, the centennial anniversary of women getting the right to vote. They invited people to vote for their favorite candidates on a web site they set up, womenon20s.org, and the campaign went viral. I wrote about it, as did many others, including gail collins of the times ( \"finally, we've got a current event that's not depressing \" ). Susan sarandon and other celebrities lent their support,",

As we have closely followed recent statements from treasury secretary steven mnuchin indicating he has yet to focus his attention on the design, we also have kept our eyes and ears on what the bureau of engraving and printing is saying about the process. We are encouraged that all indications are that the directives from previous treasury secretary, jack lew, are still being followed. But we, like senator shaheen, are concerned that the agency may not hit the target of revealing the actual bill designs in time to honor the centennial of women's suffrage in 2020, and rollout of the bills into circulation a"

Researchers compiled data from roughly 4,000 people of varying body weights, then created a computer model that estimates the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease and assesses how weight affects life expectancy. They found that severely obese men between 20 and 39 years of age lost 8.4 years of life compared to their healthy-weight counterparts. Women lost 6.1 years, the bbc reports. Further, those men experienced 18.8 more years of ill heath; the figure for women was 19.1. Obese people could lose up to six years and people who are overweight could lose up to three years, per findings published in the lancet diabetes and endocrinology. The younger the individual the worse the potential impact: those in their 60s and 70s who are severely obese were found to have lost one year, but dealt with 7 more years of ill health. \" in terms of life-expectancy, we feel being overweight is as bad as cigarette smoking, \" says lead author dr. Steven grover in a press release. He next wants to personalize the findings: \" what may be interesting for patients are the ' what if? ' questions. What if they lose 10 to 15 pounds? or, what if they are more active? how will this change the numbers? \" ( read why you ' ll probably weigh less today than on monday. )",

His struggle with drugs included six prior overdoses. A gofundme page set up to cover bossie's funeral expenses noted the investment the family made in trying to get help for bossie, there described as someone who \" purposely confronted life, always trying to please the people he loved while balancing personal demons. \" bossie died a day after a 26-year-old ohio man whose obituary was even more explicit about his heroin overdose. \" all of the wonderful blessings that he had: talent, friendships, positive outlook on life, and, most importantly, family were sidelined by a wrong decision to do drugs, \" wrote alex hesse's family. They similarly expressed a hope that hesse's story might \" help one person not make the same mistakes that alex did, save one family from losing a loved one far too young. \" ( for more unusual obituaries, read this, this, or this. )",

Ruled a homicide by the medical examiner, her death was reclassified a \" noncriminal death \" by police. Millicent brown-johnson, 28, and her son, jovan perkins, 8, died of smoke inhalation in a fire deemed arson, but police refused to investigate them as homicides. Chicago magazine's unnamed sources call this a \" travesty \" and a \" numbers game, \" while the police department is using phrases like \" fewest murders since 1965 \" and \" lowest overall crime rate since 1972. \" the city's inspector general has jumped into the fray with an audit of 2012 crime rates, finding a modest 3.1 % error rate by police, chicago tonight reports. Then there are people like austin perkins, whose son jovan died in the fire: \" i just don't understand how police can categorize it the way they are categorizing it, \" he says. \" i just want answers.

She tried to lure them back into the office with perks, meetings, and stricter performance reviews before resorting to this new policy. ( an informal survey by allthingsd finds that most other tech companies support telecommuting. ) as does virgin. Airline chief richard branson weighs in on the controversy, calling the move \" perplexing \" and \" a backwards step. \" he writes, \" working life isn't 9-5 any more. The world is connected. Companies that do not embrace this are missing a trick. \" but, though studies have found work-at-home employees to be more productive, they are also less innovative, one expert explains to the new york times. \" if you want innovation, then you need interaction. If you want productivity, then you want people working from home. \" and other big companies, including bank of america and zappos, have recently made their telecommuting policies stricter. And at zdnet, andrew nusca supports the move. After all, it \" befits a chief executive hired with explicit orders to disrupt a company's stagnating culture, \" he writes. \" like many mature internet companies, [ yahoo ] has seen malaise set in as it maintains existing businesses, rather than pursuing new ones. \" this is a way to make the company, once again, \" a place where the brightest minds on the internet [ convene ] to create and innovate. \"",

            "Measles was declared eliminated from the united states in 2000, but anti-vaccination beliefs may be playing a role in bringing the disease back, a new government report suggests. The centers for disease control and prevention investigated more than a decade's worth of data on measles cases ( including 2013 cases through the end of august ) and found that most patients had not been vaccinated. Measles is a respiratory disease caused by a virus, that spreads through breathing, coughing and sneezing and causes a serious rash and fever. While measles is harder to come by in the united states, the cdc notes it's still a worldwide public health problem that can be brought over to the country and spread to americans. Measles can also result in serious complications including ear infections, pneumonia, and brain swelling -- or encephalitis, which occurs in about one out of every 1,000 cases and may",

To do so, they surveyed more than 1,000 quebec residents. According to medical daily, they found four of those sexual interests are actually statistically normal. Approximately 35 % of respondents were interested in or had experienced voyeurism. It was 26 % in regards to fetishism and frotteurism ( rubbing oneself against a non-consenting stranger ), and 19 % for masochism. Overall, nearly half of people surveyed were interested in doing something in one of those eight categories, and one-third already had. Researchers believe those numbers would be similar across north america and europe, inverse reports. While four of the sexual activities considered abnormal — voyeurism, exhibitionism, frotteurism, and pedophilia — are illegal because they involve non-consensual partners, study co-author christian joyal believes the others should no longer be considered as such. \"if people are happy, if everybody is consenting, i don't know why it should be abnormal, especially in 2016, \" he tells the globe and mail.

The high volume suggests that tough new rules put in place by the trump administration — including the separation of migrant children from their parents — are not having an \" immediate deterrent effect, \" per the washington post. The newspaper adds that president trump is pressuring department of homeland security chief kirstjen nielsen to quickly improve the arrest stats, used as a gauge for immigration flows, before the november midterms. However, a dhs statement argues that \" no one expects to reverse years of political inaction overnight or in a month. \" similarly, nbc news quotes a dhs official who points out that migrants reaching the border now set out months ago, before knowing about the tougher rules. Among other things, attorney general jeff sessions announced a \" zero tolerance \" policy in april and vowed to prosecute everyone caught trying to cross the border illegally, reports npr. Some specifics from the may numbers: border patrol agents made 40,344 arrests, and customs officers made another 11,568. The latter typically occur at official ports of entry, when migrants are deemed inadmissible. Dhs says 6,405 unaccompanied children were detained, up more than 2,000 from april. Many of those were youths trying to reach a parent already in the us. About 11,000 immigrant minors were in us custody as of late last month, up 20 % from april, per the post. The year-over-year comparisons were greater: \" the number of illegal family units trying to cross the border increased by 435 % in comparison to may 2017 — and the number of unaccompanied alien children apprehended illegally crossing the border increased by 329 % in may 2018 in comparison to may 2017, \" says the dhs statement.

        "summary": "How did oj simpson slip out of a nevada prison unseen in the dead of night? fearing another ford bronco-style chase, nevada corrections officials hoodwinked media eagerly awaiting the disgraced football great's release, the los angeles times reports. Simpson, 70, wasn't transferred to the usual prison preceding parole, though reporters were led to believe he would be. Instead, simpson walked out of lovelock correction center, where he has spent the last nine years. Believing assurances that inmates aren't sprung on weekends, no press were there to record the moment when simpson was released at 12: 08am on sunday. A corrections spokeswoman says the sneaky strategy was hatched after the department was \" inundated \" with media requests and \" aggressive \" messages that raised concerns about simpson's safety. But one reporter tracked down the celebrity parolee about five hours later on the road some 75 miles northwest of las vegas, per espn. Sitting in the back of a white car, simpson spots the video camera and says, \" man, how in the... Have y ' all been... Y ' all stalking me? \" asked how it feels to be out, he says, \" i ' m in a car for the last five hours, so how do i know how it feels to be out? … look, i've been in nowhere usa … doing nothing. Nothing has changed in my life. What do you expect? \" as to where he was headed, simpson says, \" it's none of your business. … can i have a break here? \" while his reps were silent about his future, a parole official tells the ap simpson will settle at an undisclosed home in the vegas area. He cannot leave the state without permission, where he will be monitored during the maximum five years he is on parole.",

        "summary": "British pm theresa may is coming down hard against calls for a second brexit referendum, even as ex-foreign secretary boris johnson slams her stance — setting up speculation that the two are on a collision course, reports the bbc. May wrote in the sunday telegraph that it would be a \" gross betrayal of our democracy \" to have another vote, adding that \" millions came out to have their say \" in the june 2016 vote that set brexit in motion. Her embattled government has faced increasingly strident calls for another vote once the terms of britain's future relations with the eu are known, the ap reports. In a competing piece in the daily telegraph on monday, johnson wrote that may's so-called chequers plan for continued ties with the european union after brexit will leave britain in a weakened position. He said that may is giving eu leaders a \" victory \" without even trying to forge a brexit plan that would strengthen britain's hand after it leaves the eu in march, reports the ap. He said that britain has \" gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank. \" the prime minister used her column to defend her chequers proposal, and said she won't be pushed around by eu negotiators. ( president trump has advised may to sue the eu instead of negotiating. )",

        "summary": "One of the biggest holders of private student loans appears to have flunked bookkeeping 101 — and that could be very good news for a lot of borrowers. The national collegiate student loan trust, a group of 15 trusts holding 800,000 student loans worth around $ 12 billion, has been pursuing borrowers in court, but case after case is being tossed out because the trusts have been unable to produce paperwork proving they actually own the loans, the new york times reports. Lawyers say that since the loans generally passed through many hands before reaching national collegiate, the paperwork involved is so shoddy that it could affect most of the $ 5 billion of its debt that is in default. Some borrowers say the company has sued them trying to collect on high-interest loans that they never even took out. National collegiate has been going after old debts so aggressively that bloomberg dubs it a \" lawsuit machine, \" though lawyers say that since most debtors who are sued either pay up or ignore the summons, resulting in a default judgment, the company tends to back off in the relatively rare cases when debtors go to court. But such cases may become more common: \" as news of the servicing issues and the trusts ' inability to produce the documents needed to foreclose on loans spreads, the likelihood of more defaults rises, \" the company's lawyers warned in a recent filing.",

Investigators yesterday revealed they were spoken after one of the plane's communications systems had already been deliberately switched off, but malaysian officials backpedaled on that timeline today. The ap reports that malaysia airlines ' ceo today said it's thought the co-pilot uttered the words, which experts say went against standard radio procedures and will likely be examined for signs of psychological stress, reports reuters. The latest chronology, per the guardian and the crikey blog: the last acars transmission came at 1: 07am. The system is designed to transmit every 30 minutes, meaning it was turned off sometime before 1: 37am. The words were said at 1: 19am. At 1: 22am, the plane's transponder last communicated with radar, and is believed to have been turned off shortly thereafter. More: but investigators are looking beyond the cockpit as well, notes reuters, and are in the process of carrying out background checks on the plane's 227 passengers. One name being specifically mentioned: that of a 29-year-old malaysian aviation engineer. Experts say mohd khairul amri selamat would have had the knowledge needed to fly the plane, and a police official confirms \" we are looking into mohd khairul as well as the other passengers and crew. \" some 26 countries have now been asked to evaluate radar and satellite data in the search for the missing plane, which is now believed to have flown on either a northern or southern arc from its last known location, the bbc reports.

The fictional couple rides a similar skull-sporting motorbike, as noticed by cultural critic suede on instagram. Quartz points out the similarities between the visually compelling style of both mambety's filmmaking and beyonce and jay-z's music videos, as well as beyonce's constant looks toward african culture for inspiration for her work.

The objects spotted in satellite images could be jet debris, but they could just as easily be some of the large quantities of the trash ( think \" ghost \" fishing ships 50 feet long ) found in even the most remote parts of the oceans, a marine debris specialist with the ocean conservancy tells the new york times. This as a fourth set of satellite images — these from a french firm and revealed today by malaysia's defense minister — show 122 \" potential objects, \" reports nbc news. More: weather conditions have improved today and the search has resumed with ships and planes from six countries — australia, new zealand, the us, japan, china, and south korea — now taking part, reports the bbc. As for those 122 objects, they were captured via satellite sunday and are located in a 154-square-mile patch of the southern indian ocean. Australia has been tasked with checking out the new lead, but it's unclear if that can happen before dark or will instead happen tomorrow, reports the new york times. \" some of the objects appeared to be bright, possibly indicating solid materials, \" and measure as long as 75 feet, says hishammuddin hussein. He called the new images \" the most credible lead that we have. \" cnn notes planes on the hunt for debris today did spot three objects, but none were clearly from a plane. Charles moore, an expert on marine debris, says that large amounts of debris from the japanese tsunami in 2011 and even the 2004 indian ocean tsunami are still floating around, much of it concentrated in ocean gyres. The search area is on the edge of one gyre and the storm that halted the search yesterday \" could act as a highway, pushing the stuff in or out, \" moore says. Meanwhile, bloomberg reports that \" the opening salvo \" may have been fired \" in what may become a barrage of litigation. \" a law firm hired by the father of passenger januari siregar has asked malaysian airline system and boeing for 26 different kinds of information ranging from possible defects to the plane's cargo. \" we believe that both defendants named are responsible for the disaster of flight mh370, \" says a partner with the firm.",

        "summary": "You may hear that nuts and peanuts are fattening, constipating, and allergy-inducing, but don't worry: they're good for you after all, the new york times reports. Several large studies — at least two with tens of thousands of participants — found that more nut consumption led to less chance of dying, particularly of heart disease or cancer. While those studies looked at the fairly well-off, a new study of the less affluent published in jama internal medicine found similar results among 200,000 people. As for nut allergies, which are more common these days, a study shows that women can reduce the chance of having a child with the allergy by eating nuts or peanuts during pregnancy. Feeding peanuts to infants can also lower their risk of becoming allergic. Then there's fat content: yes, nuts and peanuts are relatively fatty, but a review of studies found that nut-eaters are generally slimmer than those who avoid nuts. Even people who added nuts to their diet lost weight better than those who didn't, probably because nuts ' high protein and fat kept them from snacking on sweets. What's more, a british study last year found that adding peanuts or peanut butter to breakfast kept people satisfied with a stable blood sugar for as long as 12 hours. And two more recent studies found reasons particular groups of people should indulge in nut-eating: teens who ate about half an ounce of nuts each day were much less likely to develop metabolic syndrome, which ups one's risk of early heart disease and type 2 diabetes, according to a press release. And post-menopausal women with high cholesterol who ate 1.5 ounces of walnuts a day experienced better vascular function, the dallas news reports.

They performed both tactile and heat sensitivity tests on each participant at four different locations of the penis: per the new york times, \" the midline shaft, the area next to the midline, the glans and, for the uncircumcised, the foreskin. \" the researchers tested the inside of the forearm to serve as the control. Turns out the men didn't differ in sensitivity to either touch or heat at any place tested, and for both groups the forearm was less sensitive than any part of the penis. \" we can conclude that there are no significant differences in sensitivity between the circumcised and uncircumcised groups, \" says a study co-author. \" one researcher who only used fine touch to measure penile sensitivity claimed the foreskin is the most sensitive part of the penis, so removing it via circumcision is detrimental to men's sex lives, \" the lead researcher says in a queen's university statement. \" we found that while the foreskin was more sensitive to fine touch, it was not more sensitive to the other stimuli we used, and those stimuli are likely more important in sexual pleasure. \" one-third of males in the world are circumcised, per the release, a number that could climb with both the us in favor of neonatal circumcision and a push for it in african countries to reduce hiv transmission.

            "Wednesday, april 13, 2016 kingston - new research conducted at queen's university has found the penises of men who were circumcised as newborns are no less sensitive than intact ( uncircumcised ) penises. Jenn bossio, a clinical psychology phd candidate, studied 62 men between the ages of 18 and 37. A total of 30 were circumcised and 32 were not.

        "summary": "The third democratic presidential debate is being held saturday night in new hampshire. And while the dem debates have been less dramatic than their republican counterparts, a number of experts think that could change saturday. Here are six things to watch when the prospective nominees ( and martin o ' malley ) take the stage: bernie sanders ' \" nuclear option \": slate thinks it's time for sanders to really attack hillary clinton, if only for the headlines. \" doing that would break his campaign promise and go against his policy-above-politics mission statement — but it would also end his coverage drought. \" can clinton stay cool?: everything is breaking clinton's way, reuters reports. All she needs to do is avoid being drawn into a fight with sanders. \" she ' ll be fine, \" a former new hampshire democratic party chair says. \" she's just going to deliver her message and stay on point. \" lessons from trump: sanders could look to the gop in his search for a much-needed \" big moment, \" according to the los angeles times. \" he will be under pressure to transform what has proved to be a staid platform this election season into something more akin to what the republican debates have been: unpredictable, attention-grabbing. \" \" controversy-free \" clinton: fox news reports clinton should tread carefully since the majority of viewers for a pre-christmas saturday night debate are likely to be republican operatives taking notes for the general election. \" is there an opening, a vulnerability, or a faux pas that... Comes back to haunt her next year? \" sanders against the establishment: the debate could be colored by friday's squabble between sanders and the dnc, according to the orange county register. \" sanders and o ' malley have accused the dnc for months of eagerly, if quietly, trying to make it easier for clinton to secure the nomination. The senator will have to determine how far he's willing to go in his criticism of clinton now. \" o ' malley who?: the wall street journal reports the low-polling o ' malley just needs to remind viewers why he's taking up their time. \" mr. O ' malley's key challenge will be to justify his continued presence in the democratic presidential race. \"",

        "summary": "The netflix series 13 reasons why has been controversial from the start: it deals frankly with a teenage girl's suicide, including a tough-to-watch 3-minute scene of the suicide itself. Debate has been split between one camp saying it serves an important function by raising awareness and another arguing that it could encourage copycats. Now, a study published monday in the journal of american medicine has its authors clearly taking sides: they want netflix to pull the show. The details: the searches: the study found that online searches about suicide increased in the three weeks after the show premiered on march 31. Such queries were up 19 % over a 19-day span, \"reflecting 900,000 to 1.5 million more searches than expected, \" per the researchers. Ideation: some of the increased searches were related to prevention, with \" suicide hotline number \" up 21 %, for example. But researchers were vexed by the increase in searches related to what they term suicidal ideation; specifically, \" how to commit suicide \" searches rose 26 %, \" commit suicide \" rose 18 %, and \" how to kill yourself \" rose 9 %, per nbc news. Tough talk: \" our worst fears were confirmed, \" says lead author john ayers of san diego state university, per cnn. \" that is, thousands of people, thousands more, are searching online about ways to kill themselves. \" he called for netflix to pull the show and stop filming on season 2. Netflix response: \" we always believed this show would increase discussion around this tough subject matter. This is an interesting quasi experimental study that confirms this. We are looking forward to more research and taking everything we learn to heart as we prepare for season 2. \" in april, one of the show's writers defended the premise and the frank treatment in vanity fair. Real world: child psychiatrists say their patients are bringing up the show, reports the washington post. One at cincinnati children's hospital recalls a 12-year-old girl: \"she said to me, 'i saw that show and it really convinced me that suicide was a normal thing to do, ' \" he says. \"i've never heard that. In 30 years, i've never heard a child say this thing made me think suicide is normal. That really got my attention. \" one big criticism: the study faulted the show for not following media guidelines from the world health organization, which discourage the use of detailed scenes of suicides. No definitive link: the study doesn't show that the spike in searches led to any suicides, but previous studies of such searches have shown",

        "summary": "As mourning continues for the tragic death of miami marlins pitcher jose fernandez, investigators are starting to unravel the circumstances behind his passing early sunday morning. Lorenzo veloz, a spokesman with the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission, tells usa today sports that the 32-foot boat fernandez was on appeared to be traveling at \" full speed \" when it slammed into a jetty off of miami, that alcohol and drugs aren't believed to be factors in the crash ( though toxicology reports are still pending ), and that the 24-year-old died from the impact of the crash, not from drowning. Veloz says he had stopped the boat, owned by one of the other two men who died in the accident, before for safety checks, and while fernandez was a frequent passenger, along with other marlins players, \" jose was never known to drive it. \" more from around the web on fernandez's untimely death: josh levin pens a poignant tribute for slate on fernandez, \" the future of baseball \" who \" changed what it meant to play the game the right way. \" mike downey, meanwhile, calls fernandez \" one of baseball's brightest stars \" for cnn. Usa today explores how fernandez's death has devastated florida's cuban community. Don mattingly, manager of the marlins, wept at a press conference sunday afternoon, per abc news, comparing fernandez's joy of playing to that of unjaded little leaguers. Along those lines, mashable points out a \" victorious photo \" from fernandez's high school days posted on facebook by the florida high school athletic association — an image that shows fernandez basking in that pure love of the game. Espn's dave szymborski tweeted out \" what remains my favorite jose fernandez gif, \" which has already been retweeted more than 8,000 times. It's pretty amazing — and smile-inducing.",

        "summary": "And suddenly, there's a hot rumor about a presidential ticket for 2020 — featuring a democrat and a republican, no less. The potential pairing is gop gov. John kasich of ohio and democratic gov. John hickenlooper of colorado, reports mike allen at axios. The two ( nicknamed \" the johns \" ) have been making the rounds of late talking about health care, and things are going so well that they're reportedly toying with the idea of an independent bid in 2020, with kasich as the presidential contender. Coverage: nothing formal: cnn has a source familiar with the discussions who confirms all of the above, while stressing that it's all informal at this point. \" the idea of a joint ticket has been discussed, but not at an organizational or planning level. \" expanding platform: both axios and cnn say that while the two have been focusing on health care for now, they ' ll be expanding their platform in the near future. Job creation and immigration will be two main topics, with a particular focus on helping those losing jobs to automation. A podcast or perhaps a cable show also may be in the works. Health care: the pair plan to release their ideas for stabilizing the nation's insurance markets next month, and they aim to get other governors to sign on, reports npr. They wrote about the broad strokes and the need for a bipartisan approach in the washington post in june. One specific idea: they don't like the obamacare rule requiring businesses with 50 or more employees to provide insurance; the number should be higher, they say, as it currently hurts small businesses. Worry for democrats: at the national review, jim geraghty argues that it would be bad news for democrats if such a ticket comes to be. ( he's skeptical it will. ) \" if you're a vehement trump foe, you want the anti-trump vote split in as few ways as possible, \" and kasich-hickenlooper could steal needed electoral votes from democrats ( including a total of 27 in the governors ' home states ). Not quite a denial: hickenlooper was asked about the possibility of a joint ticket in early august and said, \"i don't think kasich would ever do that, \" per politico. But he didn't exactly rule it out: \" you never know. You never say.... I do like the idea of working with him in some context at some point. \" 503 days: on thursday, hickenlooper said on msnbc that he wouldn't even think about a presidential run until his gubernatorial term ends",

Meanwhile, protesters — on their eighth day of demonstrations — chanted \"resign! resign! \" walker will address his constituents tonight during a live 6pm \"fireside chat, \" reports the ap via weau. The protests have actually helped the budget in one unforeseen way: after being bombarded with hundreds of calls per hour, wisconsin's toll-free legislative hotline has been shut down for the first time in more than 20 years. Since each call to the hotline costs the state 10 cents, sources tell talking points memo that disconnecting it will save a lot of money. Today, republican senators plan to return to business as usual, voting on non-budget issues that would not require a quorum of 20 members. In an attempt to draw the democrats back to the state, they may bring a bill to the floor requiring voters to show identification at polling places — a bill opposed by the democrats. One nonbudgetary issue the republicans will consider? a resolution commending the green bay packers for their super bowl win.

The white house statement said the us has \" identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack \" that would \" likely result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children, \" cnn reports. The statement said the preparations resemble those before april's attack and although the us is in syria to fight isis, assad and his military will pay the price if they conduct \" another mass murder attack using chemical weapons. \" the us fired dozens of cruise missiles at a syrian airbase after the april attack. The white house warning is \" unprecedented over the course of the conflict, \" valerie szybala of the syria institute research group tells the bbc. \" we've never had this sort of pre-warning from us intelligence about a potential attack, \" she says, adding that the warning is \" quite plausible \" because us intelligence apparently saw early signs of previous attacks. After the warning, us ambassador to the united nations nikki haley tweeted that any more attacks on the people of syria will be blamed not just on assad, but on russia and iran, \" who support him killing his own people. \" but the ap frames other officials as being \" caught completely off guard \" by the warning. The ap reports the state department, pentagon, and us intelligence agencies would typically all be informed and have a say before a move like this, and that may not have been the case here.

It seems that hawaii has about 88,000 such cesspools, and the seeping sewage is posing a genuine threat to beaches, coral reefs, and drinking water, reports the wall street journal. Specifically, health authorities are worried about rising nitrate levels in groundwater, which are approaching or already exceeding the legal limit in parts of the state. \"additionally, cesspool effluent contains nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorous, that can disrupt the sensitive ecosystems of hawaii, \" per a state health department report cited by news.com.au. So why the cesspools? much of hawaii is mountainous, making it difficult and expensive to lay sewer lines. As a result, many homes have long pumped their sewage into cesspools, a solution becoming increasingly troublesome as the population grows. The state has outlawed the creation of new cesspools, but replacing those already in existence would cost an estimated $ 1.75 billion, per state health officials. Lawmakers are reaching out to engineers for help, as the problem takes an ever more tangible toll. Around kahaluu bay, for instance, \"skin infections consistent with sewage-contaminated surface waters have been documented in this area, \" says the health department.

Surfers and snorkellers have fallen victim to skin infections and the state's drinking water, its coral reefs and famous beaches are all under threat because of a cesspool crisis. Cesspools are holes in the ground where untreated human waste is deposited and this waste is entering the drinking water in part of the state — pushing nitrate levels close to the legal limit. According to the state health department, the state now has 88,000 cesspools across its eight major islands, more than any other state in the us. As the state's politicians scramble to find a solution, the report states that the cost of replacing each cesspool could reach around us$ 1.75 billion. Worryingly, more that 90 per cent of the state's drinking water comes from groundwater wells, but these cesspools deposit 53 million gallons of raw sewage into the ground every day. \"cesspools also present a risk of illness to island residents and a significant harm to streams and coastal resources, including coral reefs, \" a new report from the department stated. \"cesspool effluent ( liquid waste ) poses significant threats to human health and sensitive ecosystems. Cesspool wastewater is untreated and contains pathogens, bacteria and viruses that may spread disease. \"additionally, cesspool effluent contains nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorous, that can disrupt the sensitive ecosystems of hawaii. \" the report states that the replacement of cesspools would take years. \"replacement of each existing cesspool with an improved treatment method could cost $ 20,000 or more per system, for a total cost around $ 1.75 billion for the 87,900 currently inventoried cesspools, \" it reads. The report states that cesspools can affect humans by either overflowing and exposing us to waste directly or the leaching of liquid waste into the groundwater — which can transport cesspool contamination over \"significant distances \".

Here's a taste of what people are saying: \" you know there is something seriously wrong with anna karenina when you start rooting for the train, \" writes mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle.

            "Bad literary adaptations are all alike, but every successful literary adaptation succeeds in its own way. The bad ones — or let's just say the average ones, to spare the feelings of hard-working wig makers and dialect coaches — are undone by humility, by anxious obeisance to the cultural prestige of literature. The good ones succeed through hubris, through the arrogant assumption that a great novel is not a sacred artifact but rather a lump of interesting material to be shaped according to the filmmaker's will. The british director joe wright has seemed to me — up to now — to belong to the dreary party of humility. His screen versions of jane austen's \"pride and prejudice \" and ian mcewan's \"atonement \" are not terrible, just cautious and responsible. For all their technical polish and the admirable discipline of their casts, those films remain trapped in literariness. Instead of strong, risky interpretations, they offer crib notes and the pale flattery of imitation. The proof of their mediocrity is that admirers of austen or mr. Mcewan will find no reason for complaint. Mr. Wright's \"anna karenina \" is different. It is risky and ambitious enough to count as an act of artistic hubris, and confident enough to triumph on its own slightly — wonderfully — crazy terms. Pious tolstoyans may knit"

            "Bad literary adaptations are all alike, but every successful literary adaptation succeeds in its own way. The bad ones — or let's just say the average ones, to spare the feelings of hard-working wig makers and dialect coaches — are undone by humility, by anxious obeisance to the cultural prestige of literature. The good ones succeed through hubris, through the arrogant assumption that a great novel is not a sacred artifact but rather a lump of interesting material to be shaped according to the filmmaker's will. The british director joe wright has seemed to me — up to now — to belong to the dreary party of humility. His screen versions of jane austen's \"pride and prejudice \" and ian mcewan's \"atonement \" are not terrible, just cautious and responsible. For all their technical polish and the admirable discipline of their casts, those films remain trapped in literariness. Instead of strong, risky interpretations, they offer crib notes and the pale flattery of imitation. The proof of their mediocrity is that admirers of austen or mr. Mcewan will find no reason for complaint. Mr. Wright's \"anna karenina \" is different. It is risky and ambitious enough to count as an act of artistic hubris, and confident enough to triumph on its own slightly — wonderfully — crazy terms. Pious tolstoyans may knit"

        "summary": "That coke bottle you were proud to throw in the recycling bin so it could be repurposed into another coke bottle may actually be … part of a carpet sample in mumbai. It turns out that a very small percentage of the world's plastic beverage bottles are made out of recycled plastic, with an ibisworld analyst breaking it down into stark numbers for buzzfeed: less than a third of the world's plastic bottles ( around 6 billion pounds per year ) are recycled, and of that sample, only about 20 % is transformed into new plastic bottles. Instead, most of the bottles are sent off to plastics factories in emerging markets, where they're used in textiles such as clothing, bags, and carpeting, and the reason appears to come down to cost. Because new plastic is often crafted out of petroleum, the current low price of oil makes it cheaper to just start from scratch than use recycled materials. A recent greenpeace report points the finger at the world's top six soft-drink companies ( not counting coca-cola, which wouldn't give up its numbers ) for using a combined average of just 6.6 % recycled pet in their bottles. ( a greenpeace blog post takes the soft drink industry to task for saying consumers don't recycle enough. ) retailers are trying to capitalize on the bottles-to-attire trend: target, for example, has started carrying clothing lines from companies that make their attire out of recycled plastic, wcco reports. But textiles aren't usually recycled themselves, often because they're blended with non-recyclable materials. \" fifty years from now … people will be digging landfills and thinking we were crazy... How could we create landfills rather than recycle? \" leon farahnik, founder of the carbonlite recycling company, tells buzzfeed. ( more plastic-devouring bacteria may be needed. )",

        "summary": "With crowds the size of those on the hajj pilgrimage, normality can turn to chaos and horror in a matter of minutes, according to experts who say yesterday's stampede near mecca followed a grimly familiar pattern. A big part of the problem is \" fluid dynamics — except people are the fluid, \" writes adam rogers at wired, explaining what happened yesterday appears to have been a \" turbulent \" stampede caused when two enormous crowds of pilgrims coming down different streets met at a bottle-necked intersection and normal crowd dynamics collapsed. As people continued to pour in, the crowd density quickly became lethal. \" people don't die because they panic. They panic because they are dying, \" professor of crowd science keith still tells the ap. Experts say that crowds can turn deadly so easily because unlike some other animals, humans evolved living in small groups and moving in large numbers doesn't come instinctively. \" we don't know how to behave in these scenarios, \" princeton biologist iain couzin tells wired. \" these situations do not allow us to naturally feel that we can understand what's going on. \" psychologists tell the new york times that the nature of the hajj itself may have played a role. The crowd of pilgrims — many of them elderly — came from all over the world and had no shared language or culture, making communication difficult and probably increasing the sense of panic. In other developments: the death toll has now reached 717, and saudi arabia's king salman has promised that there will be an investigation \" to improve the level of organization and management of movement \" of pilgrims, the bbc reports. An adviser to a hajj tour operator in the uk says that while the saudis blame such disasters on \" god's will, \" the real cause is \" man's incompetence, \" reports the guardian. He says that pilgrims have told him the deadly movement of people happened because the king was meeting dignitaries at his nearby palace, causing the closure of two entrances to the \" stoning of satan \" ritual.",

        "summary": "Iraq's top shiite cleric issued a statement during friday prayers today, calling on everyone — shiite and sunni alike — to fight back against the islamic state of iraq and syria, the new york times reports. It is \" the legal and national responsibility of whoever can hold a weapon, to hold it to defend the country, \" a representative of grand ayatollah ali al-sistani said in the holy city of karbala, eliciting cheers of \" it will be done! \" the representative said these volunteers \" must fill the gaps in the security forces, \" and that those who died in the fight would be martyrs, but stopped short of calling for a general armed response. In other developments: iran has deployed two revolutionary guard units to iraq, with the goal of protecting baghdad, karbala, and fellow holy city najaf, security officials tell the wall street journal. Iran has also positioned troops along its border, and given its air force the go ahead to bomb isis rebels within 60 miles of it. Isis rebels briefly seized two towns near the iranian border, saadiyah and jalawla, but they were beaten back by government troops and kurdish forces. But kurdish forces have also seized the opportunity to take over the long-disputed oil city of kirkuk, meaning nouri al-maliki now has essentially two foes to contend with. The chaos has sent oil prices to their highest level this year — they touched $ 114.20 per barrel in morning trading today before settling back to $ 113.35. Analysts say that so far there's little direct threat to iraq's top oil fields, but that the instability has markets nervous. A un human rights official says there have been verified reports of 17 civilians killed, and unverified reports of as many as 30. Four women have also killed themselves after being raped. But he also chided iraq's government for shelling civilian areas, the bbc reports. If isis can keep its hold on mosul, bbc analyst jeremy bowen believes it will be \" the most significant act by a jihadist group since al-qaeda attacked the us on 11 september 2001, \" and potentially force a redrawing of the middle east's borders — including breaking up iraq along sectarian lines. The conflict is already having implications in syria, as isis brings weapons seized from iraq across the border, reuters reports.",

Military scientists from the us and australia teamed up on the project, called hypersonic international flight research experimentation, or hifire.

To put the feat in more concrete terms, the scientists say such an engine could make a trip from sydney to london possible in a mind-boggling two hours. ( today's travelers can figure on closer to 24 hours, factoring in connecting flights. ) in fact, it would make any trip in the world much more manageable and make it far easier to put satellites in space. But popular science also takes note of the military applications: \" with that much speed, it would be impossible for an enemy [ to have enough time ] to move anything on the ground after radar detected [ a ] plane, letting it either capture pictures immediately or drop bombs almost unimpeded. \" the next test, in which the engine would separate from the booster rocket, is scheduled for 2017.

        "summary": "Jeb bush this week unveiled his proposal to repeal and replace obamacare, one that would include an unspecified \" transition plan \" of roughly 18 months for the 17 million people currently covered under the affordable care act, reports ap. Bush laid out some of the particulars of the overall plan in a speech and in an op-ed in the union-leader of new hampshire, decrying the \" skyrocketing health insurance premiums \" he says have been caused by the new law. The new york times thinks bush's plan would indeed lower individuals ' costs but probably wouldn't cover as many as obamacare does. Some highlights: people would get tax credits to buy catastrophic plans. Individual and employee mandates would be eliminated, reports forbes. People could contribute a maximum of $ 6,650 to their health savings accounts, up from $ 3,350. In general, bush wants to make plans more \" portable, \" reports nbc news. Control on regulating insurance would shift from the federal government to the states, and states would get what npr describes as a \" block grant-like medicaid program \" to cover low-income people. Bush wants to overhaul the fda to spur innovation and get drugs on the market more quickly. \" his reliance on low-cost catastrophic health plans could reduce premiums for some consumers, \" observes the times, \" but could also leave them with fewer health benefits, and he would also loosen the affordable care act's popular guarantee of coverage, regardless of a person's pre-existing medical conditions. \" bush also has \" a controversial proposal to limit the tax breaks on high-end health insurance that americans receive through their employers which in some ways resembles obamacare's unpopular cadillac tax on expensive health plans, slated to take effect in 2018, \" reports politico.",

But that was before satellites combed the region. Archaeologists at the university of exeter who surveyed satellite images in areas of deforestation have uncovered 81 previously unknown amazon settlements — some covering hectares, others as small as 100 feet wide — marked by fortification ditches, sunken roads, ceramic fragments, and earth platforms on which wooden houses would've stood between 1250 and 1500, reports the guardian. \" we filled the last piece of a puzzle in amazonian archaeology, \" study author jonas gregorio de souza tells live science, describing a network of settlements believed to have covered 154,000 square miles of the amazon's southern rim, perhaps supporting a population in the millions in the pre-columbian era. Archaeologists couldn't get access to all 81 sites in the upper tapajós basin, but examined 24 in person and believe hundreds more exist. In addition to upending the idea that the amazon was mostly untouched, their study in nature communications \" definitively discredits early low estimates of 1.5-2 million inhabitants for the whole basin, \" they say, per usa today, and shows settlements next to small streams and springs may have hosted large populations. Though linked to other settlements, the sites each have \" a different local expression of … architectural traditions, \" says de souza. \" there are different kinds of site layouts and artifacts that are found in each of the regions. \" de souza adds many questions remain, but \" the big debate is how populations were distributed. \" scientists expect to learn more as additional sites are discovered and examined.

The aggressive changes to us tax laws announced this week helped kill the deal, handing what reuters calls a \" major victory \" to president obama in his efforts to go after corporate mergers set up to get companies out of paying taxes. The merger would have moved pfizer's address — but not its operations or headquarters — to ireland, where allergan is registered and where it would pay far less in corporate taxes. The two companies weren't specifically named on monday when the treasury announced its new rules, but one of the provisions went after a feature that allergan is known for: scooping up lots of other companies in acquisitions. The new rules don't permit stock accumulated through a foreign company's us deals over the last three years to count toward the book value required to meet the inversion threshold. This affected allergan since, in this time period, it had carried out a $ 66 billion merger with actavis, a $ 25 billion purchase of forest laboratories, and a $ 5 billion takeover of warner chilcott. Obama noted tuesday that tax avoidance was a \" huge problem \" worldwide. \" while the treasury department's actions will make it more difficult... To exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole, only congress can close it for good, \" he said, per reuters.

            "New york ( reuters ) - u.s. Drug maker pfizer inc agreed on tuesday to terminate its $ 160 billion agreement to acquire botox maker allergan plc, in a major victory to u.s. President barack obama's drive to stop tax-dodging corporate mergers. A company logo is seen through branches at a pfizer office in dublin, ireland november 24, 2015. Reuters/cathal mcnaughton the decision to end the biggest tax \"inversion \" ever attempted, which would have seen pfizer slash its tax bill by redomiciling to ireland where allergan is registered, came a day after the u.s. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions. While these new rules did not name pfizer and allergan, one of their provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger; allergan's previous history as a major acquirer of other companies. The subsequent demise of the deal allows obama to claim a big win during his last year in office. Earlier on tuesday, obama called global tax avoidance a \"huge problem \" and urged congress to take action to stop u.s. Companies from tax-avoiding corporate \"inversions \", which lower companies tax bills by redomiciling overseas. \"while the treasury department's actions will make it more difficult... To exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole, only congress can close it for good, \" obama said. Pfizer and allergan will announce the termination of their deal on wednesday, a source familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified ahead of any official statement. Pfizer and allergan declined to comment. Pfizer was concerned that any tweaks to salvage the inversion might have provoked new rules by the u.s. Treasury, and so was leaning earlier on tuesday to end the deal, a source had earlier told reuters. Pfizer will have to pay allergan up to $ 400 million for its expenses as a result of terminating the deal, according to their merger agreement. Pfizer shares had ended trading in new york on tuesday up 2 percent on hopes the company would walk away or renegotiate the deal in its favor.

In the first of seven episodes, the british comedian of borat fame meets assorted americans while posing as conspiracy-obsessed billy wayne ruddick jr., israeli terrorism expert col. Erran morad, ultra-liberal dr. Nira cain-n'degeocello, and ex-con artist rick sherman. Here's what reviewers are saying: hit and miss. The only effective segment of the four was the one involving morad, who managed to persuade gun enthusiast philip van cleave to take part in a video for \" kinderguardians, \" which advocates arming 4-year-olds and features guns disguised as stuffed animals, writes linda holmes at npr. Segments like the one where ruddick meets bernie sanders don't work as well because the subjects aren't in agreement with the baron cohen character, instead considering him a crackpot. \" aims high but goes low. \" charles bramesco at the guardian found it frustrating that the gun segment worked so well, while others, including one in which sherman \" pitches his bodily-secretion artworks to a laguna beach dealer, \" flopped. \" in a fractious and chaotic nation beset by families torn asunder, militarized forces suppressing protests, and lives lost, he sets the bar extremely high for himself, \" he writes. \" when he manages to clear it, the results are dazzling... But anything less feels like a waste of time. \" the great divide. Baron cohen also mocks liberals, but for them, the \" show serves as a kind of horror-comedy comfort food, a cathartic validation of the feelings brought on by the current news, \" writes steven zeitchek at the washington post. But at the same time, \" it is likely to reinforce the beliefs of the conservatives who view hollywood as, essentially, a place of knee-jerk scorn that will stop at nothing to mock its audiences, particularly in middle america. \" \" no moments of truth. \" the show \" offers no moments of truth when the hunted, led to the extremes by a stranger with funny facial hair, finally realize that they are in a logical pretzel and suddenly comprehend the consequences of their thinking, \" writes mark kennedy at the ap. \" no, baron cohen isn't interested in confronting his subjects head-on or breaking them like 60 minutes, only mining the absurdist humor of those who are absolutely certain they are right. \" he adds, however, that the upcoming second episode is better than the first.",

But such denials will only become harder to sustain with the cries of infants taking over refugee camps in neighboring bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of rohingya have sought refuge since august of last year, reports the guardian. Aid agencies there are preparing for a wave of births as a result of systematic rape by the myanmar army, described in a un report as \" integral to their strategy [ of ] humiliating, terrorizing, and collectively punishing the rohingya community and serving as a calculated tool to force them to flee their homelands and prevent their return, \" per irin. One activist says he knows of 15 women impregnated, though that's likely only a fraction of the true number. That's because most of the myanmar sexual assaults — estimates suggest up to two-thirds — go unreported, including for fear of social stigma. One woman who's already given birth to a son tells the guardian that some refugees disapprove of him, and her own daughters believe he should be turned over to an orphanage. As a result, some rape survivors may hide their pregnancies, give birth in secret, and abandon their babies. Aid groups are prepared to shelter mothers and aid infants left uncared for, but identifying them in time is a challenge. As a rep for save the children puts it, \" there is a child protection crisis on the doorstep that urgently needs to be addressed. \" urgently indeed, as may typically marks the start of the monsoon season.

And in case of a biochemical attack, well, the car is sealed to protect against those, too. Its doors weigh as much as those on a 757 jet, and its has run-flat tires inside its almost bus-sized wheel wells. It also includes a night vision system, door handles that can be electrified to shock anyone trying to get inside, and the ability to fire tear gas, lay down an oil slick, or deploy a smokescreen. Among its communications technologies? the ability to dispatch the nuclear codes. Oh, and in addition to the seven seats it has inside to make sure secret service members can surround the president, it also contains a bunch of medical supplies — including a refrigerator full of blood matching trump's blood type. Commissioned by the secret service in 2014 and going by the same nickname as the last presidential limo, which debuted in 2009 — \" the beast \" — it's one of a dozen making up what was initially estimated to be a $ 15.8 million contract. Cadillac won't comment on the car, but the secret service has confirmed the new limo, as well as a twin version traveling in trump's motorcade, posting a photo of the two together on twitter.",

And, if the president is injured, the beast has an extensive range of medical supplies on board, including a refrigerator full of the president's own blood type. Protecting a president is never easy, especially in a modern era when potus could face any manner of threat, from handguns to rocket-propelled grenades. The latest version of the beast, which was commissioned by the secret service in 2014, is believed to combine a variety of different technologies, starting out with a heavily modified platform from a chevrolet kodiak, a heavy-duty general motors truck.
