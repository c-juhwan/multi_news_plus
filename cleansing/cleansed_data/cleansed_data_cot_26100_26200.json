        "summary": "Elon musk, the founder of tesla motors and commercial space company spacex, has finally unveiled the \" hyperloop, \" his much-hyped new transportation system idea. And it's pretty far out there. It's a bit like a human shotgun, explains businessweek: people would sit inside aluminum pods, which would shoot through steel tubes at up to 800 miles per hour. It could also potentially hold cars. The pods would be mounted on skis above an air cushion, launched by an electromagnetic pulse and magnets, then propelled along the route by motors. \" the pod can go just below the speed of sound relative to the air, \" says musk. Musk's vision is for a hyperloop from la to san francisco, fueled by disappointment in the planned $ 70 billion california high-speed train, which he thinks will be too slow and expensive. Musk estimates a hyperloop following the i-5 would cost $ 6 billion to build with pods just for people, or $ 10 billion for pods that could hold people and cars. Beyond that, he says, the system would work best for trips under 1,000 miles, like new york to dc or boston. However, sci-fi fans and californian commuters may be disappointed to learn that musk has no plans to commercialize the hyperloop yet. \" i ' m just putting this out there as an open source design, \" he says. \" i still have to run spacex and tesla. \" but if no one else takes his idea and runs with it, he may find time \" down the road. \" you can read musk's blog post on the hyperloop here.",

For instance: \" a president who would all but call sen. Kirsten gillibrand a whore is not fit to clean the toilets in the barack obama presidential library or to shine the shoes of george w. Bush. \" as that line suggests, the editorial goes after trump for his tuesday tweet saying that gillibrand \" would do anything \" for campaign contributions. But it goes far beyond that. Details and reaction: other lines: by \" clearly implying that a united states senator would trade sexual favors for campaign cash, president trump has shown he is not fit for office, \" reads the editorial, headlined, \" will trump's lows ever hit rock bottom? \" at another point, it complains that \" trump's utter lack of morality, ethics and simple humanity has been underscored during his 11 months in office, \" before ticking off examples. And another: trump is \" uniquely awful. His sickening behavior is corrosive to the enterprise of a shared governance based on common values and the consent of the governed. \"",

        "summary": "A national poll showed donald trump slightly ahead of hillary clinton on tuesday, though, as nate silver points out at fivethirtyeight, cherry-picking polls isn't necessarily indicative of an overall trend: per the fivethirtyeight model that analyzed a whole slew of surveys, clinton appears to still be in the lead by about 3 or 4 percentage points nationwide — a slicing in half of the lead she enjoyed in mid-october. But it's the electoral college numbers that have silver declaring trump as \" no longer really a long shot, \" though he remains the \" underdog. \" in the site's polls-only model, trump has a 30 % chance ( as of this posting ) of emerging the electoral vote victor, or 31 % if you go by the polls-plus model, which includes economic and historical data. And silver notes even though some are skeptical trump can nab the needed 270 electoral votes, there are ways in which he could win. Although a trump victory is unlikely if clinton wins the popular vote by 3 to 5 points, a popular-vote win of 2 points or less by either clinton or trump opens up various options for trump to emerge victorious — mainly because it would prove harder for clinton to hold onto her so-called \" firewall \" states, and because she wouldn't have a lot of backup options available to compensate for the numbers she may lose in other competitive states. In fact, silver says clinton would \" probably lose \" the electoral college if the popular vote was precariously close. Still, heavy.com presents its own electoral map and says trump would basically need to garner every undecided state to pull off a win — a \" tough row to hoe. \" ( check out fivethirtyeight and heavy.com for a more careful look. )",

            "A new case of mad cow disease has surfaced in a dairy cow in california, but the animal was not bound for the nation's food supply and posed no danger, the agriculture department said tuesday. John clifford, the department's chief veterinary officer, said the cow from central california did not enter the human food chain and that u.s. Meat and dairy supplies are safe. It's the fourth such cow discovered in the united states since the government began inspecting for the disease to keep the food supply safe. \" there is really no cause for alarm here with regard to this animal, \" clifford told reporters at a hastily convened press conference. Clifford did not say when the disease was discovered or exactly where the cow was raised. He said the cow was at a rendering plant in central california when the case was discovered through regular usda sample testing. Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ), can be fatal to humans who eat tainted beef. The world health organization has said that tests show that humans cannot be infected by drinking milk from bse-infected animals. The disease is always fatal in cattle, however.

They said no meat from the animal had entered the food chain, and that people aren't at risk of contracting the disease through consumption of milk from an infected cow. But the discovery of the sick cow's carcass at a rendering plant revived a top safety concern for the beef industry that had receded after six years without any appearance by the illness in the u.s. It is the fourth case of mad-cow disease detected in the u.s. Since the first was discovered at a processor in washington state in 2003. The finding comes as the beef industry struggles with softer demand as consumers have pushed back against rising beef prices. Recent publicity about a two-decade-old ground beef additive known as lean finely textured beef — dubbed \" pink slime \" by critics — has further curbed beef demand though the product poses no known safety risks. \" it's the last thing we need, \" said cattle rancher daniel mushrush, part-owner of mushrush ranches in strong city, kan. \" it's not going to help demand at a time when we need demand. \" the u.s."

According to a 47-page us military dossier, a physician filled the fuhrer with barbiturate tranquilizers, morphine, bulls'semen, a pill that contained crystal meth, and other drugs, depending on hitler's momentary needs, the daily mail reports. By this account, hitler downed crystal meth before a 1943 meeting with mussolini in which the fuhrer ranted for two hours, and took nine shots of methamphetamine while living out his last days in his bunker. The dossier's allegations will be considered in a british tv documentary this weekend called hitler's hidden drug habit, the times of israel reports. Just who was hitler's dealer? named theodor morell, he succeeded as a berlin doctor despite his unconventional methods and controversial past. Revelations that he had treated jews hurt his business in 1933, and many thought he appeared jewish; hitler's inner circle disliked both his appearance and his practices, according to the times. A us collector who found the dossier also criticized morell, calling him \" a quack and a fraud and a snake oil salesman. \" yet hitler trusted him until the nazis fell in 1945. Hitler's alleged use of other drugs, like cocaine and amphetamines, has already been documented — the international business times mentions two documentaries that cover it — but his apparent reliance on 74 drugs, including crystal meth, adds to the portrait of a hypochondriac ruling nazi germany while high.

Per the ap, the evidence includes recent dna tests conducted by the fbi that show that hair found in a car linked to the slaying could have come from sheila keen warren. According to the sun-sentinel, that dna evidence led to keen warren's sept. 26 arrest. At the time, she reportedly asked police \" is my husband under arrest, \" in addition to her pleas to know why she'd been arrested. When police told her she was accused of marlene warren's murder, they say she put her head down and refused to say anything further. Prosecutors released the evidence without comment. Her attorney, richard lubin, did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment. Michael warren, reached by phone, declined comment. Detectives have declined to rule him out as a possible suspect. Keen warren, now 54, remains jailed without bond. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. According to the documents, she became a suspect shortly after the slaying when marlene warren, 40, opened her door on a saturday morning to find a clown in an orange wig, a red nose but normal high-top shoes holding two foil balloons and carnations. Her then 20-year-old son and his friends, who were in the house, say the clown handed her the gifts. The clown without saying a word then shot her in the face, walked slowly to a chrysler lebaron convertible and drove away.",

Back at the sheriff's headquarters, she sat in an interview room making small talk about her nickname \"debbie \" and where she lived. But then the conversation turned serious when she was told she's the accused shooter in south florida's killer clown case from 27 years earlier. Authorities had come to hold her accountable for the may 26, 1990, slaying of marlene warren, 40, in wellington. Keen warren placed her head down on a desk and declined to say another word. This glimpse of keen warren's sept. 26 capture, and the renewed investigation that led to it after all these years, is detailed in files released thursday by the palm beach county state attorney's office, in response to public records requests.

            "One moment sheila keen warren was on a trip to see her mom in vermont. The next, she was handcuffed and placed in the back of a virginia sheriff's cruiser. \"where are we going? \" \"am i under arrest and what for? \" \"is my husband under arrest? \" the 54-year-old blond-haired woman in the bright aqua tank top, capri jeans and flip-flops asked. Back at the sheriff's headquarters, she sat in an interview room making small talk about her nickname \"debbie \" and where she lived. But then the conversation turned serious when she was told she's the accused shooter in south florida's killer clown case from 27 years earlier. Authorities had come to hold her accountable for the may 26, 1990, slaying of marlene warren, 40, in wellington. Keen warren placed her head down on a desk and declined to say another word. This glimpse of keen warren's sept. 26 capture, and the renewed investigation that led to it after all these years, is detailed in files released thursday by the palm beach county state attorney's office, in response to public records requests. The records explain how recent testing of dna evidence was the key to cracking a high-profile case that had long gone cold but is now the center of a death penalty prosecution",
            "West palm beach, fla. ( ap ) — two nights before a clown fatally shot a woman at her front door, a customer showed up at a nearby costume shop and begged to be let in at closing. On this night 28 years ago, the woman urgently told two clerks she needed a clown suit, an orange wig, white gloves, a red nose and enough white makeup to cover her face completely. She passed on the floppy shoes. One of the clerks in a photo lineup identified the customer as sheila keen, who was rumored in may 1990 to be having an affair with victim marlene warren's husband.

        "summary": "People are increasingly taking uber instead of ambulances to get to the hospital, new research suggests. For a ( non-peer-reviewed ) research paper released wednesday, economics professor david slusky and dr. Leon moskatel looked at ambulance usage in 766 us cities upon the arrival of uber from 2013 to 2015. Slusky tells the mercury news that when uber came to a city ambulance usage dropped \" at least \" 7 % using the \" most conservative \" numbers.

For people who aren't having a medical emergency, uber is a much more cost-effective option than an ambulance. \" we don't all need to fly first-class all the time, \" slusky says. It could also save insurance companies money to the point they might want to consider advocating for ride-sharing apps, phys.org reports. And using an uber instead of an ambulance would allow passengers to choose their hospital instead of being driven to the nearest one, according to mashable. However, the president of the american college of emergency physicians says patients can't always be trusted to judge if their situation is an emergency or not. \"a paramedic has the training and the ability to deliver life-saving care en route, \" he tells the news. \"where i really have a hard time believing an uber driver is going to attend to you. \"",

Another says she wants a wall if trump becomes president, though the cbc notes that trump says he \" loves canada \" and doesn't want a northern border wall.

The girl was reportedly given water and immediately rushed to a nearby clinic after a pulse confirmed she was alive, the local police chief told the star.

An aurora city official tells the sun-star that a doctor was sent to the girl's home after health officials heard that relatives wouldn't bury her because she was alive. According to news.com.au, the doctor used a cardiac monitor to confirm her death, then advised her parents to bury the body soon to prevent the spread of disease — and the aurora city official confirms to the sun-star that she was laid to rest yesterday.

( she made her name by taking an \" abortion ship \" to ireland to skirt irish abortion laws. ) but gomperts has problems: since last year, when the us began investigating indian companies'delivery of generic drugs, her tracking numbers have been getting lost in the mail. And some countries will hold up the shipments at customs. \" the anxiety level of the women goes up, \" says her indian supplier. \" it's painful. \" and gomperts refuses to ship to the us, where abortion is legal, even though some states ( like texas ) are cracking down on access to abortion clinics. Meanwhile, activists in texas are advising women on how to use abortion drugs at home, or training \" abortion doulas \" to help women through the experience of taking mifepristone and misoprostol. How bad is that experience? it can be painful and has a death rate of 0.5 out of 100,000, most studies show, but lydia kae writes at daily life that she only had mild cramps, bleeding, and morning sickness. \" although i hope i never have to, if i found myself unexpectedly pregnant again, i would choose another medical abortion, \" she writes.

The zoo also emphasized that it took care to eliminate risk: the bear was on a chain, and the scene was shot before dairy queen opened ( the shop's owner was the one doing the feeding ). The zoo is charged with taking the 1-year-old bear from its facility without notifying provincial officials, and bos says he plans to plead guilty. \" we were busy.

Less well known is that, while an average of 47 kids under the age of 20 died each week from firearm-related incidents in 2013, \" in many states, physicians face legal restrictions \" when it comes to even discussing guns with families. So says one of the authors of a washington university study published in the journal of pediatrics; the study notes that even in places where such conversations are legal, physicians are \" concerned about offending and losing patients \" and tend to avoid discussing firearm safety. Indeed, the researchers found just 13 % of parents had discussed guns with their pediatrician. After surveying 1,246 parents in missouri and illinois pediatricians ' waiting rooms in 2015, researchers found that 36 % of parents reported having firearms in the child's home and another 14 % reported that their child regularly visits the homes of people with guns. Of those with guns, 20 % said they keep their guns and ammunition in the same place and 3.5 % said loaded firearms are accessible to children. In states where discussing guns with doctors is illegal, such as florida, doctors who break the ban risk losing their medical licenses, reports the christian science monitor. Researchers call for treating firearm safety like other safety issues, such as locking up medicine and household cleaners; 71 % of surveyed parents who own guns were in favor of pediatricians advising about the safe storage of firearms.

        "summary": "More than 13 years after his wife vanished on sept. 11, 2001, wealthy upstate new york car dealer calvin harris will sit through his third trial for her murder. Though he was twice convicted of killing michele harris, who disappeared after leaving her waitressing job amid a bitter divorce, both convictions were overturned. Now, prosecutors will aim for one that sticks, despite having neither a body nor a murder weapon, the ap reports. In opening remarks thursday, tioga county district attorney kirk martin told jurors that harris, now 53, \" exercised the ultimate act of control \" in murdering his wife, then 35, who could have taken half of his $ 4 million fortune. Small amounts of michele's blood found in the kitchen and garage of the couple's 200-acre estate suggest harris killed his wife with a blunt object either late on sept. 11 or in the early hours of sept. 12, prosecutors say. The defense argues the age of the blood stains was never determined. Harris maintains he is innocent. Harris ' lawyers also reportedly question how harris could have killed his wife in the home the pair shared with their then-young children and disposed of the body within the prosecution's time frame. Harris ' four kids — now ranging in age from 15 to 20, the daily mail reports — chatted with their dad and sat behind him in court yesterday. \" the prosecution ignores the real evidence of who actually committed this crime, \" says harris ' lawyer bruce barket, who will make his opening statement on monday. Harris ' first conviction was overturned after a farmhand said he saw michele and a man in his mid-20s early at 5: 30am on sept. 12 at the end of the couple's quarter-mile driveway in spencer, ny, where her minivan was found at 7am. His second conviction was thrown out due to trial errors. The latest trial should run six to eight weeks, the daily review reports.

        "summary": "Wednesday was such a strange day at the office of government ethics that some observers thought it had been hacked — or driven over the edge by the challenges of the trump transition. After donald trump tweeted that he would be \" leaving \" his businesses, the agency fired off a series of tweets heartily congratulating him on the \" total divestiture \" — though trump hadn't said anything about selling. In messages the washington post describes as \" deeply out of character for a federal ethics agency that is famously quiet and unadventurous, \" the oge said: \" bravo! only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest. Good call! \" and \" brilliant! divestiture is good for you, very good for america! \" the nine tweets were deleted an hour after they appeared wednesday morning, but they reappeared in the afternoon. It wasn't clear whether the oge was being sarcastic or was referring to trump plans that had not been made public, npr notes. Trump has spoken of handing his businesses to his children instead of selling them and putting the proceeds in a blind trust, which ethics experts say isn't enough to avoid conflicts of interest. Another oge tweet mentioned that the agency had discussed divestiture with trump's lawyers. Politico reports that oge spokesman seth jaffe said the non-partisan agency was responding to trump's announcement, not to any undisclosed information. He made it clear that the office views divestiture as the only ethical choice. \" divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not, \" he said. \" we don't know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it. \"",

Fbi spokesman greg comcowich said the tipster called the fbi after she saw the recent commercials that ask people, particularly women, to be on the lookout for bulger's girlfriend, catherine greig. The commercial said that greig had several plastic surgeries before going on the lam and was known to frequent beauty salons. The 30-second ad ran this week in 14 television markets. Comcowich said the fbi won't disclose the tipster's identity or say where the tipster called from. The fbi was offering a reward of up to $ 2 million for information leading to bulger's capture _ the largest ever offered for a top ten domestic fugitive _ and up to $ 100,000 for grieg's capture. The 81-year-old bulger is wanted for numerous crimes, including 19 murders. He appeared in a boston federal court friday."

        "summary": "Jpmorgan is considering paying a record $ 500 million settlement over allegations that california and other states paid its power plants to not produce electricity, the wall street journal reports. The alleged scheme is simple: the states promise to give energy providers \" make whole \" payments whenever they lose money firing up their plants. So jpmorgan would allegedly post low day-ahead prices to trick states into telling them to turn their plants on, but then come back the next day with drastically higher prices. When states balked, the bank would pocket a profit on the make whole payment. Initially, regulators had wanted a $ 1 billion fine, but that number has fallen in settlement negotiations. The $ 500 million would still represent a record for the federal energy regulatory commission, though the new york times points out that it would mean little to jpmorgan, which last week announced a $ 6.5 billion quarterly profit. Still the settlement is being hotly debated within the bank. Commodities chief blythe masters believes the bank did nothing wrong, but others want to strike a deal quickly. Masters herself could ( but, sources say, probably won't ) face individual charges as well.",

The nation's largest bank, which has previously clashed with its regulators, is seeking to settle with the federal agency that oversees the energy markets, according to people briefed on the matter. The regulator, the federal energy regulatory commission, found that jpmorgan devised \"manipulative schemes \" that transformed \"money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers, \" a commission document said. The potential deal, the people said, is expected to cost the bank about $ 500 million, a record for the commission, which has adopted a harder line with wall street over the last year. For jpmorgan, which reported a record $ 6.5 billion quarterly profit last week, the fine will hardly dent the bottom line. The accusations against jpmorgan surfaced this spring in the confidential commission document, reviewed by the new york times, that outlined a pattern of illegal trading in the california and michigan electric markets. The document, a warning that investigators would recommend that the agency pursue civil charges, also claimed that a senior jpmorgan executive, blythe masters, gave \"false and misleading statements \" under oath. It is unclear whether ms. Masters would be included in the potential settlement, but people close to her said that the regulator was unlikely to file a separate action against her.

The three stars who experienced the largest dip in popularity: in science versus dr. Mehmet oz, it looks like science won — at least in terms of what the public thinks about him. Oz saw a 16-point increase in his negative q score, helped along by repudiation from the medical community on what they call his \" quack \" advice. Ariana grande's 26-point increase in neg q was probably boosted by her penchant for \" maliciously \" licking doughnuts and saying she hates america, even though she's since apologized. The person who once held one of the highest q scores is now the person on the list with the largest dip in popularity ever. One of the company's executive vps says it's a \" complete reversal \" for bill cosby, who saw an unprecedented 43-point increase in his negative q score, due to things like this and this. As for celebrities who had the highest and lowest q scores overall: tom hanks and morgan freeman tied for the most popular stars, with a q score of 48 points each, while kim kardashian nabbed the highest negative q score at 71 points — a fact that probably doesn't hurt her much because people love to hate her, the company vp notes.

Maher told wolf blitzer that he felt no need to \"apologize for being a proud westerner, \" or for being worried that \"muslim people in these [ western ] societies are having babies \" at a faster clip than non-muslims. He clarified: and when i say westerner, i mean someone who believes in the values that western people believe in that a lot of the muslim world does not. Like separation of church and state. Like equality of the sexes. Like respect for minorities, free elections, free speech, freedom to gather. These things are not just different from cultures that don't have them. … it's better. … i would like to keep those values here. Maher feared that \"we can project ahead \" to the possibility of england \"losing those values. \" while he and blitzer didn't discuss the sharia law issue that arose friday night, they did discuss another topic that had come up during the same conversation: whether maher would've been fired from npr, as juan williams had been, if he worked there. \"probably, \" maher said. Here, the two seemed to agree. Watch the clip from cnn below: video of his 'mohammed remark ' from friday's real time with bill maher: via hbo have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",
            "\" it's a tricky thing politically to jump on that bandwagon [ and vote for the legalization of pot ] because i think that maybe people still see it as taboo, \" said the ' hangover'star. Pulling a joint and lighter from his sportcoat, the funnyman proceeded to puff away -- pausing to allow conservative reporter and fellow guest margaret hoover to sniff his prop and confirm it was the real thing. Fire up this clip and see the outrageous moment for yourself: zach galifianakis lit up late-night tv, literally, when he decided to smoke some weed on hbo's'real time with bill maher. ' maher -- a longtime opponent of legislation outlawing marijuana -- welcomed galifianakis ( currently promoting his new buddy movie'due date, ' co-starring robert downey jr. ) to the set of his current-events talk show, where a live panel discussion ensued about california's upcoming vote on whether to decriminalize the drug."

And that matters because, according to the bbc, abnormally large babies are at risk of injury during delivery and can have a higher chance of obesity and diabetes later in life. Researchers from the university of cambridge looked at more than 4,000 first-time mothers, publishing their findings thursday in diabetes care. Obese women were 63 % more likely to have an abnormally large fetus by 28 weeks. Women with diabetes were 200 % more likely. Women who were both obese and diabetic were 500 % more likely to be carrying an abnormally large fetus. More than 4 % of the women researchers studied were diagnosed with gestational diabetes, which women develop during pregnancy, but experts say it can affect up to 18 % of pregnancies. Screenings for gestational diabetes often take place as late as the 28th week of pregnancy. Researchers now say that's too late; they should be done by the 24th week and maybe even earlier. Experts say gestational diabetes can increase the risk of stillbirth and is largely preventable. \" it is important to emphasize that immediate changes to lifestyle, including a healthy diet and moderate levels of exercise, can have significantly positive effects on a woman and her baby's health, \" the bbc quotes a doctor from the royal college of obstetricians and gynecologists as saying.

Well, now the new yorker has weighed in, and its report has allegations that are even more damning. Ronan farrow writes that during his 10-month investigation, he spoke to 13 women who accused weinstein of sexually assaulting or harassing them. The alleged incidents took place from the 1990s through 2015: \" three women — among them ( italian actress and director asia ) argento and a former aspiring actress named lucia evans — told me that weinstein raped them, allegations that include weinstein forcibly performing or receiving oral sex and forcing vaginal sex. Four women said that they experienced unwanted touching that could be classified as an assault, \" writes farrow. Four of the women say weinstein masturbated in front of them or exposed himself. The story also includes an audio recording from an nypd sting operation in which weinstein admits groping the breast of model ambra battilana gutierrez and says he's \" used to \" that kind of behavior. Actresses mira sorvino and rosanna arquette tell of encounters with weinstein in which he propositioned them sexually. Both say their careers suffered when they rebuffed him.

Gwyneth paltrow recounts being asked for a massage from weinstein as a 22-year-old who had been hired to star in the weinstein-produced emma. She says she told then-boyfriend brad pitt about the incident, and pitt spoke to weinstein, who then threatened her to keep quiet. Angelina jolie had this to say to the times via email, spurred by an incident in the late 1990s: \" i had a bad experience with harvey weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did. \" another noteworthy name to weigh in: hillary clinton.

A new study of the bird unlocks some of its mysteries. As a press release explains, there is but a single complete dodo skeleton in existence, one that was found on the island of mauritius between 1899 and 1917. Other skeletons of the birds are composites, meaning they're formed from the bones of various dodos, making etienne thirioux's find remarkable — but one that hadn't been studied. Using it, researchers were able to use 3d lasers to scan the surface of the fragile skeleton and \" reconstruct how the dodo walked, moved, and lived to a level of detail that has never been possible before, \" per lead researcher leon claessens. Claessens notes that the thirioux skeleton was an even richer source of information than anticipated, as it contains \" even the smallest bones, such as the kneecaps, that are usually lost when an animal disintegrates. Several of those bones were previously unknown and have never been described scientifically. \" what they learned: the dodos weighed as much as 42 pounds, which bird watching daily reports rival today's king penguin in size. Thanks to the newly found knee and ankle bones, claessens tells livescience the researchers will be able to better determine how the dodo moved by calculating its potential muscle force. They also intend to study the jaw muscles to determine what its diet may have been. Says claessens, \" my best guess is that it was eating tremendously hard seeds, but who knows, maybe it was eating crabs. \" ( scientists are also trying to \" resurrect \" the wine king david drank. )",

        "summary": "Anders behring breivik says even he is \" shocked by many of the things i have written \" over the nearly six years he's spent in skien prison for his 2011 massacre of 77 people. The norwegian neo-nazi says he's become \" stranger \" and \" a lot more radical \" since his crimes, but that's no reason to keep him isolated. In fact, breivik says solitary confinement is to blame, per reuters. \" i've sat in a cell 23 hours a day \" with no one to criticize or correct his ideas, breivik said thursday during a state appeal of a 2016 ruling that deemed breivik's isolation \" inhuman. \" but attorney general fredrik sejersted told a judge — who earlier received a nazi salute from breivik, per the independent — that breivik only hopes to spread his ideology to other inmates. Solitary confinement keeps breivik from doing just that. And though he's also subject to frequent strip searches, brevik — described as norway's most expensive prisoner — is still treated better than many other criminals, sejersted says. He's kept in a three-room cell with a personal gym, tv, playstation, computer ( but no internet access ), books and newspapers \" to compensate for the fact that he cannot make contact with other inmates, \" says sejersted. \" that is far from violating human rights. \" breivik's lawyer, however, says his client's isolated treatment not only violates the european convention on human rights but has also made brevik \" mentally vulnerable, \" per the local. A decision is expected next month.",

Both devices found on cargo craft traveled for a time in the holds of passenger jets, and were likely part of a plot to bring down a major airliner like the lockerbie bombing that killed 270 people in 1988. The devices exposed a troubling blind spot in international aviation security. One of the devices inside a computer printer discovered in britain en route from yemen to chicago, was \" one of the most sophisticated we've seen, \" a source told the guardian. \" the naked eye won't pick it up, experienced bomb officers did not see it, x-ray screening is highly unlikely to catch it, \" he added. An informant tipped off saudi arabian intelligence about the device. Asiri once booby-trapped his own brother in a failed assassination attempt on a saudi prince, reports the new york daily news. He's also believed to be man who created the explosive worn by wanna-be \" underwear bomber \" uman farouk abdulmautalla, who was nabbed on a detroit-bound northwest airlines flight last christmas.",

Ryan's budget claims balance by 2024, but relies on $ 74 billion in savings in that year from the macroeconomic effects of cutting deficits, which cbo says would have a long-term positive effect because it would free up savings and investment capital. Democrats are sure to seize on the maneuver as phony math; without these projections, however, ryan's budget plan would fall almost $ 70 billion short of balance. The new york times writes that ryan's plan \" will serve more as a 2014 republican campaign manifesto than a legislative agenda. \" and the washington post says it \" amounts to personal manifesto on government austerity from a man who has emerged as the gop's leading light on fiscal policy. \" the post also notes that ryan wants to replace the outgoing dave camp as the next chair of the ways and means panel while still keeping his options open for a 2016 run for the white house.

( andrew harrer/bloomberg ) the 99-page plan is ryan's last budget as head of the budget committee and amounts to a personal manifesto on government austerity from a man who has emerged as the gop's leading light on fiscal policy. Term-limited as head of the budget panel, ryan is vying to become chairman of the powerful tax-writing ways and means committee next year, while still mulling a bid for president in 2016. Ryan uses his final budget to distance himself from a tax overhaul advocated by the outgoing ways",

Paul ryan ( r-wis. ) on tuesday unveiled a budget that proposes to cut $ 5.1 trillion over a decade in a bid to erase the federal deficit, while calling once again for dramatic changes to medicare, medicaid and the tax code. Ryan fiscal year 2015 budget resolution read more from the hill: ryan's final $ 5.1t cut",
            "Washington — the unveiling tuesday of representative paul d. Ryan's newest republican budget may have redrawn the battle lines for the 2014 election, detailing what his party could do with complete control of congress and allowing democrats to broaden the political terrain beyond health care and the narrower issues of the minimum wage and unemployment benefits. Mr. Ryan, the house budget committee chairman and a possible white house contender in 2016, laid out a budget plan that cuts $ 5 trillion in spending over the next decade. He said it would bring federal spending and taxes into balance by 2024, through steep cuts to medicaid and food stamps, and the total repeal of the affordable care act just as millions are reaping the benefits of the law. Defense spending would increase. Domestic programs would be reduced to the lowest levels since modern government accounting. And medicare would be converted into a \"premium support \" system, where people 65 and older could buy private insurance with federal subsidies",

        "summary": "Two life-size bronze horses commissioned to stand outside adolf hitler's chancellery disappeared from their last known location in germany in 1989. Some 25 years later, the masterpieces have been discovered in an illegal art bust, the local reports. After a year-long investigation, authorities conducting 10 raids across germany yesterday found the \" walking horses \" by josef thorak in a warehouse in bad duerkheim, along with other thorak works and a 33-foot granite relief by arno breker, the ap reports. They are now investigating eight people, aged 64 to 79, for art trafficking and handling stolen goods. Triumphant russian forces reportedly moved the horses in 1945 before they appeared on the sports grounds of a red army barracks in eberswalde of the german democratic republic in 1950. They remained there for 38 years until a newspaper article by an art historian turned the spotlight back on the illustrious works. They soon disappeared. The art historian says an acquaintance of a gdp financier recently offered her information about the sculptures, which were rumored to have been sold by the cash-strapped gdr. Police say the works belong to the government as they were commissioned by hitler's architect, albert speer, and therefore by the state, the wall street journal and washington post report. The bronze horses lost some of their grandeur over the years as children played on them and their tails were broken and poorly reattached. They were also marred by bullet holes and painted gold at one point. Police haven't described their current condition, but they were reportedly offered on the black market for as much as $ 5.6 million, per the post. A police rep says the granite relief found in the warehouse was also to find a home at hitler's chancellery but was never installed. He says it depicts shirtless fighters holding swords \" in typical nazi style. \" ( hitler wasn't just fond of art, he also made it. )",

            "Lou garou is the laziest, crappiest cop in the made-up canadian town of woodhaven. One night, after investigating a disturbance on the edge of town, he wakes up with a pentagram on his chest and a heightened sense of smell. He later transforms into a werewolf, has weird sex in a clearly fake jail cell, and finds himself the target of an occult jig where werewolvesare sacrificed to strengthen the powers of magical lizard people. But this is not a midnight skinemax throwaway. Actually, it's a cult hit on netflix. The great screenwriter william goldman once said that in hollywood, nobody knows anything about what works and what doesn't. And on paper, wolfcop sounds like a dud. But director-writer lowell dean came up with an unlikely batch of elements that clicks. First, there's the movie's tone, which combines 1980s throwback nostalgia with absurdity and horror splashes. Like in teen wolf, characters live in a relatable, working-class town; their allegiances are separated in a simple, good guys vs. Punky gangs structure. Fantastic punch lines abound. Horror films today take themselves too seriously, says dean. He aimed to subvert that. Some will say that, in classic terms, the film isn't good. No shit. Cut to the scenes when the werewolf goes in search of pig-mask-wearing thugs robbing a supermarket. He puts on his cop outfit over his fur, wields his gun as he barges inside, and when a shocked goon asks him what he is, he answers perfectly: \"the fuzz! \" after he wastes the seedy group, the wolfcop mauls/tricks out his own police car into the wolf cruiser, all while wearing welding goggles. Then he races off to a meth lab. Seriousness, subverted. As for gore, there's plenty. The flick's practical effects evoke an era of genre-specific moviemaking. The moment the wolfcop rips off a henchman's face during a fight is a true scene of horror — also, really icky — and was shot in stages with the help of practical effects guy emersen ziffle.

        "summary": "This might be the worst date in tinder history. Or the worst date in history, period. Two brits were on a first date when the woman reportedly went to use her date's bathroom, only to soon find herself in that most terrifying situation: her poo wouldn't flush. So she allegedly went with plan b: removing the poop, wrapping it in toilet paper, tossing it out the window, and, perhaps less explicitly, telling date liam smith what she just did. As smith explains in a gofundme campaign ( more on that in just a minute ), \" i was understandably concerned, \" but suggested they go outside, retrieve it, put it in the trash, and \" pretend the whole sorry affair had never happened. \" but the plan was thwarted by a \" design quirk \" in which the bathroom window was made up of two non-opening windows — and the feces was stuck in there. And, soon, so was she. Smith's date decided to climb in head-first from the top of the window and reach to the bottom to retrieve the poo. Which, amazingly, she reportedly did. But then she found herself stuck — and ultimately had to be rescued by firefighters, who broke the window in the process. Smith took to gofundme in a quest to raise some of the funds needed for what he says is about a $ 400 replacement cost. He has nearly raised $ 2,500, and says the excess will be split between a charity that brings toilets to the developing world and a firefighters charity. For the skeptical, avon fire and rescue service did confirm to the bbc that it rescued a woman trapped between two windows, with the telegraph confirming the call was made regarding smith's address at 10: 41pm on aug. 7. Smith posted photos documenting the ordeal on what gizmodo has christened \" the world's best gofundme. \" ( or is this the worst first date ever? )",

A study by swedish experts found that, over a 12-year period, middle-aged men who used whole milk, cream, and butter had a lower risk of becoming obese than did peers who avoided fattier dairy products. Meanwhile, a european review of 16 studies found most of them showed a lower risk of obesity among people consuming dairy products high in fat. What's more, a study last year pointed to more weight gain in kids who drank low-fat milk. \" we continue to see more and more data coming out ( suggesting ) consumption of whole-milk dairy products is associated with reduced body fat, \" a national dairy council executive tells npr. Why? it could be because we feel full more quickly after consuming whole-milk products, resulting in less eating. The phenomenon could also be tied to \" bioactive substances in the milk fat, \" says the exec; those substances may help us burn off the fat. But you may not want to reach for the richer stuff just yet: the saturated fat in whole milk could boost heart risk, a particular concern for those with high cholesterol.

        "summary": "It shouldn't be surprising that a survivor of a school shooting might want to demonstrate against gun violence in schools — but maybe a little bit surprising that his school would punish him for it. That's the plight of cooper caffrey, a sophomore at madison high school in ohio, where he took part in a student walkout that transpired at schools across the nation on march 14. The cincinnati enquirer reports that 16-year-old caffrey, who was shot in the stomach in 2016 while eating chicken nuggets in the school cafeteria, received detention, along with 42 other students, for the protest earlier this month. Caffrey was one of two boys shot by fellow student james \" austin \" hancock, who'd stolen his great-grandmother's gun; two others were hurt after being struck by shrapnel or while running, per the ap. Cooper originally had no intention of protesting on march 14, especially since the student council had agreed with the administration it wouldn't seem \" unified \" to protest in favor of gun control ( the area is a rural gop stronghold ). But then the principal made an announcement that anyone who disrupted the day would get punished, and cooper got angry at being told how he could react, as he texted his dad — so he and a few dozen others walked out. One person who supports cooper's detention: his dad, marty, who says he gets that the school wants to keep students safe. \" the whole purpose of a walkout is to protest against an establishment, \" he wrote in a facebook post. \" i do not expect the establishment to support the walkout. \" read the 2017 enquirer story on how cooper dug deep after he was shot and forgave the boy who shot him.",

The key difference this time is that the protesters are led by islamists, particularly the muslim brotherhood, instead of the more secular groups that pushed for the ouster of hosni mubarak, notes the new york times. The protesters want the military to back off and let a civilian government run the country. A key factor at play is that the first parliamentary elections since mubarak left begin nov. 28, and the muslim brotherhood is expected to do very well, notes ap. The military, however, clearly wants to retain a big say in running the country — the interim ruling council just proposed the idea of declaring the armed forces to be the guardian of the country's \" constitutional legitimacy. \" ( it was that document that triggered today's protests. ) \" those who fear islamist movements in egypt, i tell them don't be scared of islam in egypt, \" said one leading imam. \" egypt is islamic, like it or not. \"",

        "summary": "The supreme court today struck down longstanding rules capping the total money individuals can donate to politicians, parties, and certain pacs. What does it mean and who does it benefit? here's a taste of the reaction pouring in from pundits, advocates, and leaders: the court \" pressed ahead with the majority's constitutional view that more money flowing into politics is a good thing — even if much of it comes from rich donors, \" writes lyle denniston at scotusblog. While the ruling \" was not as sweeping \" as citizens united, \" the practical result of the new ruling is almost sure to be that wealthy individuals... Will be able to spread their money around among more candidates and political groups. \" the ruling \" appears like a winner for the republican party, \" which has a \" wider base of mega-donors, \" observe mark murray and carrie dann at nbc. But they note that money doesn't always buy victory — barack obama was outspent in 2012 — and that parties typically adapt to these changes, negating any advantage before long. John boehner nonetheless celebrated the decision. \" freedom of speech is being upheld, \" he told reporters, according to politico. \" you all have the freedom to write what you want to write, donors ought to have the freedom to give what they want to give. \" mitch mcconnell agreed, stressing that the ruling \" does not permit one more dime to be given to an individual candidate. \" democrat patrick leahy, meanwhile, said the court's various moves \" have eviscerated our campaign finance laws, while chuck schumer called the ruling \" a small step, but another step on the road to ruination. \" reform advocates are livid, the new york daily news reports. \" the court has reversed nearly 40 years of its own precedents, laid out a welcome mat for corruption, and turned its back on the lessons learned from the watergate scandal, \" complained the president of common cause. John roberts ' opinion makes the interesting argument that this will be good for transparency, since more money that would have flowed to unlimited super pacs will now flow to parties and candidates, david weigel at slate points out. But he has trouble buying it. \" the largest donors in politics have hundreds of millions of dollars to throw around.

The idaho state department of agriculture on friday said that the turtle, who was allegedly fed the puppy by a preston junior high school science teacher as students watched, was euthanized \" humanely, \" per fox13. It reports that idaho classifies snapping turtles as an invasive species, and teacher robert crosland had no permit allowing him to possess one. The statesman reports that in a press release, the isda explained that relocating invasive animals is a thorny undertaking due to the stress it inflicts on the animal and the limited number of appropriate release sites. A fish and game rep added that the turtles can have long lives and \" can be highly predacious on native species. \" the puppy incident reportedly occurred march 7; the turtle was seized tuesday and euthanized the next day. The news has sparked outrage and spurred dueling online petitions supporting crosland and calling for his firing. Fox13 reports the preston school district reported a violent threat it received to the fbi; uniformed officers have been stationed at all preston school district schools. Investigators are looking into whether animal cruelty charges are justified. In a statement, franklin county prosecuting attorney vic pearson said calls were pouring in to law enforcement and his office, which is \" hindering our ability to complete what needs to be done to reach the end goal of justice in this case. \" the ap notes the film napoleon dynamite was set in preston, which is home to about 5,200 people.

With no workable proposal on the table, members won't even try a vote and will likely skip the nov. 23 deadline meeting the debt ceiling accord called for altogether. But a range of issues still need to be addressed within weeks, including the democrats ' push for an extension of unemployment insurance, president obama's call for extended payroll tax cuts, and adjustments to the alternative minimum tax and doctors ' medicare reimbursements. Another potential battle in the coming months: some republicans are hoping to remove the \"trigger \" for automatic cuts built into super committee legislation. The parties did, in fact, come close to a deal on nov. 13, the new york times notes. Democrats held an emergency meeting that sunday evening when they learned that a possible deal, which included a tax hike, had support from at least one republican. But their hopes were quickly dashed. At the heart of disagreements were the bush tax cuts, the times reports. The washington post notes that senior aides last night made a final round of checks to assess whether either side was willing to give a little; they weren't. The announcement is expected to come after the markets close today. Each side has since blamed the other for the failure.",

Its $ 9 billion in annual revenue, from things like ticket sales, merchandise, and tv contracts — that's all subject to taxation. But the league's head office is a 501( c ) 6 trade association.

Through tv deals alone, the nfl has inked nearly $ 30 billion with various television networks. And so often, fans like you and me are asked to foot the bill for new stadiums through our own taxes. Yet despite being the most profitable sports league in the entire world, the nfl does not pay federal taxes. The nfl should pay their fair share towards our economy! just like major league baseball, which gave up its nonprofit status in recent years, as well as the national basketball association, the nfl should not be able to hide under a nonprofit status in order to avoid paying federal taxes. The nfl has methodically worked to shift all the power to their side, leaving players, employees and particularly the fans little say in what goes on with the league.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / updated by bill briggs at nfl headquarters on park avenue in manhattan, the daily business may span game scheduling, referee hiring or media-rights bargaining – an operation financially fueled by all 32 pro teams which collectively pay more than $ 250 million in annual \"membership dues. \" all of that revenue received by the league office — more than a half billion dollars since 2010 — is untouchable to the internal revenue service. Score? no, says the nfl's tax attorney, jeremy spector. He says the league office, according to u.s. Tax code, is a nonprofit trade association, promoting football and serving as an agent and organizer for the 32 clubs. And it's been that way since the 1940s. Out of bounds? yes, says u.s. Sen. Tom coburn- r-okla., who filed a bill in september to revoke the tax exemption, asserting that working folks are subsidizing a special break for a sports league. He's got 275,000 supporters in spirit: americans who have signed a change.org petition that asks congress to strip the nonprofit status. \"this doesn't pass the basic fairness test, \" said the petition's author, lynda woolard. Somewhat ironically, she adores her hometown new",
            "Despite the fact that it is a $ 9billion/year industry, the national football league ( nfl ) continues to enjoy status as a non-profit organization -- meaning it doesn't have to pay federal corporate taxes. The commissioner of the nfl, roger goodell, makes nearly $ 30 million a year -- earning more than the heads of companies like coca-cola and wal-mart. Through tv deals alone, the nfl has inked nearly $ 30 billion with various television networks. And so often, fans like you and me are asked to foot the bill for new stadiums through our own taxes. Yet despite being the most profitable sports league in the entire world, the nfl does not pay federal taxes. The nfl should pay their fair share towards our economy! just like major league baseball, which gave up its nonprofit status in recent years, as well as the national basketball association, the nfl should not be able to hide under a nonprofit status in order to avoid paying federal taxes. The nfl has methodically worked to shift all the power to their side, leaving players, employees and particularly the fans little say in what goes on with the league. We deserve a say, but do not wish to boycott our teams! therefore, we are calling on our elected representatives to revoke the tax-exempt status we bestowed upon the league"

The insiders say that clinton was revived with the help of gatorade after becoming \" overheated \" on sunday. They say she only has a mild case of pneumonia and should be back on the campaign trail later this week. In other coverage: campaign insiders tell the washington post that when she was diagnosed with pneumonia friday, clinton's initial plan was to just \" power through \" the illness. The post notes that if clinton had rested as her doctor advised, she wouldn't have made her controversial \" basket of deplorables \" remark friday, nor would she have been filmed collapsing at a 9/11 memorial event sunday. Bill clinton told cbs ' charlie rose monday that clinton has become \" severely dehydrated \" on more than one occasion over the \" last many, many years, \" but she's now feeling a lot better after getting some rest and there's no sign of more serious underlying health problems. Sources described as \" clinton allies \" tell the hill that they aren't happy about the damage the campaign has inflicted on itself with its failure to be transparent about her health. \" why couldn't the campaign just have been aboveboard about this? \" one ally says. \" she got sick.

Stranger still? \" their answers are thoughtful, reasonable, and in some ways convincing enough to make you at least consider the benefits — environmental and otherwise — of ditching the tp, \" writes lindsay abrams at salon. The logistics are pretty basic. Generally speaking, you keep a supply of cloth wipes near the toilet, put them in a can with a lid when used, and launder the cloths when they pile up. All provide tips on keeping odors in the can to a minimum, and the daring can dig into the specifics in the women's posts at frugallivingnw, becomingpeculiar, and the healthyhoneys. The posts also spell out why they see regular toilet paper as both a waste of money and a detriment to the environment.

        "summary": "Armed teachers may soon become a reality in florida. On tuesday, the state house appropriations committee approved a statewide \" school marshal \" program in which local law enforcement would train teachers to carry guns on campus, the st. Petersburg times reports.the state senate appropriations committee approved a similar bill later in the day. Superintendents or school boards would need to approve of their schools taking part in the marshal program; the goal is for 10 marshals — the name given to the armed teachers — at every school. The house decision came even as residents of parkland, where a school shooting claimed 17 lives at marjory stoneman douglas high school on feb. 14, voiced fervent opposition to it, with classmates and family members of the victims speaking out during an hours-long hearing. The presence of armed teachers at schools \" could easily cause additional chaos and fatalities, \" said linda beigel schulman, whose son, geography teacher scott beigel, died in the parkland shooting. If a school comes under attack from a shooter, \" with the ongoing chaos, law enforcement could unintentionally shoot at a teacher, \" she said, adding that her son became a teacher to teach, \" not to be a law enforcement officer. \" the marshal program was just one part of a house bill that also calls for a school resource officer in every school, improved mental health counseling, safer public school buildings, a three-day waiting period for gun purchases, increased power for police to take guns from those who pose a threat, and an increase in the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21. The house and senate proposals still need approval from the state's full chambers, plus gov. Rick scott, the miami herald reports.",

        "summary": "Friday promises to be a dramatic day on capitol hill, with a house vote that could mark the beginning of the end for obamacare — or for president trump's relationship with congressional republicans. After a vote was called off thursday, the president issued an ultimatum to gop lawmakers in a closed-door meeting, telling them that if they don't pass the american health care act, obamacare will remain and it will be their fault. A roundup of coverage: it would take 22 republican \" no \" votes to doom the american health care act, and there are currently 34 who have publicly said they will oppose it, according to the washington post's list. Another 14 republicans in the house are leaning \" no, \" while another 18 switched from \" no \" to \" yes \" after changes to the bill were promised. Sources tell the new york times that trump has privately expressed regret about pushing so strongly for a health care bill he sees as a \" troublesome stepchild. \" the insiders say trump has told people close to him that he wishes he had focused on tax reform first. The hill reports that the congressional budget office released a report on the revised bill thursday, giving it an even lower score than the first time around. The nonpartisan office found that the revised version would reduce the deficit by more than $ 200 billion less than the original while doing nothing to improve coverage levels or premium increases. The washington post looks at nine changes that have been made to the ahca to win the support of both moderates and hard-line conservatives. Politico looks at what the vote could mean for the future of the conservative house freedom caucus, which has voiced strong opposition to what it calls \" obamacare lite. \" one possibility is that the vote will cause deep rifts in the caucus. House speaker paul ryan, whose reputation hangs in the balance, didn't hang around to discuss the vote with the media thursday night, the ap reports. \" we have been promising the american people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it's collapsing and it's failing families. And tomorrow we're proceeding, \" he said in brief remarks. Financial markets are jittery ahead of the vote, analysts say. \" if this thing gets materially delayed or if we get a ' no ' vote, we're going to see a horrific market reaction. But if they vote in the morning and it passes, we ' ll have a hell of a rally, \" jake dollarhide, ceo of longbow asset management, tells reuters. Vox lists eight things about the ahca",
