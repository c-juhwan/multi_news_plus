Scientists say a \" coffee nap \" — having a cup of coffee and then a 20-minute nap — will allow for maximum alertness when you wake, vox reports. Yes, caffeine and sleep are basically polar opposites, but it takes about 20 minutes for the caffeine in coffee to go to work in your brain. There's more to it than simply killing those 20 minutes, though. It has to do with how sleep and caffeine interact with a molecule in the brain called adenosine, which makes us feel drowsy. Essentially, a nap that ends just as the caffeine kicks in clears the brain of the molecule and has us raring to go. Not sold? a few different studies have suggested a coffee nap is better than either coffee or a nap on its own. In one british case, scientists found that people using a driving simulator after a 15-minute coffee nap drove better than those who had one or the other, a short break or a burst of cold air, slate reports. People who had coffee naps also performed better on memory tests than those who only had a short snooze. Just don't sleep too long or you ' ll reach a deeper level of sleep, experts say.

        "summary": "If you found rep. Todd akin's comments on \" legitimate rape \" positively medieval, you're right — quite literally. As far back as the 13th century, a british legal text notes that \" without a woman's consent, she could not conceive, \" the guardian reports. Centuries later, in 1814, a medical text notes that \" without pleasure in the venereal act, \" conception is essentially impossible, making \" absolute rape \" an unlikely cause of pregnancy. The idea ties to a prevailing notion of the time: that a woman must have an orgasm to conceive. But it's not just our ancestors who would have found akin's claim credible. In the late 1980s, a pennsylvania state representative called the odds of such pregnancies \" one in millions and millions and millions. \" a decade later, a north carolina lawmaker said that when a person was \" truly raped, the juices don't flow, \" reports the washington post, which shares a few other examples. It also shares the results of two studies: one that suggests at least 30,000 pregnancies occur from rape every year, and another that found 6.4 % of rape victims under age 45 become pregnant.",

            "Todd akin, the republican candidate for senate in missouri, said in an interview released this weekend that he did not support abortion for rape victims because: \" if it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. \" the idea that rape victims cannot get pregnant has long roots. The legal position that pregnancy disproved a claim of rape appears to have been instituted in the uk sometime in the 13th century. One of the earliest british legal texts, fleta, has a clause in the first book of the second volume stating that: \" if, however, the woman should have conceived at the time alleged in the appeal, it abates, for without a woman's consent she could not conceive. \" this was a long-lived legal argument. Samuel farr's elements of medical jurisprudence contained the same idea as late as 1814: \" for without an excitation of lust, or the enjoyment of pleasure in the venereal act, no conception can probably take place. So that if an absolute rape were to be perpetrated, it is not likely she would become pregnant. \" this \" absolute rape \" is not quite the same as akin's \" legitimate rape \". Akin seems to be suggesting that the body suppresses conception or causes a miscarriage",

            "Todd akin, the republican candidate for senate in missouri, said in an interview released this weekend that he did not support abortion for rape victims because: \" if it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. \" the idea that rape victims cannot get pregnant has long roots. The legal position that pregnancy disproved a claim of rape appears to have been instituted in the uk sometime in the 13th century. One of the earliest british legal texts, fleta, has a clause in the first book of the second volume stating that: \" if, however, the woman should have conceived at the time alleged in the appeal, it abates, for without a woman's consent she could not conceive. \" this was a long-lived legal argument. Samuel farr's elements of medical jurisprudence contained the same idea as late as 1814: \" for without an excitation of lust, or the enjoyment of pleasure in the venereal act, no conception can probably take place. So that if an absolute rape were to be perpetrated, it is not likely she would become pregnant. \" this \" absolute rape \" is not quite the same as akin's \" legitimate rape \". Akin seems to be suggesting that the body suppresses conception or causes a miscarriage",

        "summary": "Why do so many people in the developed world stop having children after their first? that's the question researchers set out to answer in a study recently published in demography. According to their findings, having a child made the majority of participants more unhappy than the death of a partner, divorce, or unemployment, the washington post reports. The study looked at 2,016 germans from before their first child to at least two years after, asking them to rate their general happiness through major life events on a scale of 1 to 10. About 70 % of respondents saw their happiness decrease in the year after the child's birth, with the average drop measuring 1.4 units — which researchers consider a \" severe \" decline ( a partner's death registered only one unit ). The post reports the biggest reason for new parents ' falling happiness is the \" continuous and intense nature of childbearing, \" which includes sleep deprivation, breast-feeding woes, depression, and relationship troubles. But biological anthropologist helen fisher puts the blame on the social isolation of new parents, reports cbs news. She says that with divorce, death, and unemployment, people trip over themselves to help and support you, but with childbirth \" you get some presents from various friends, and then they just leave you alone because they figure you're too tired and too busy. \" the study concludes that governments fretting over low birth rates — germany's is 1.5 per woman — should see how they can support new parents. ( here's what made us happy in 1938... And 7 decades later. )",

In fact, on average, the effect of a new baby on a person's life in the first year is devastatingly bad — worse than divorce, worse than unemployment and worse even than the death of a partner.

            "A standing puzzle in demography is why fertility in many developed countries is so far below replacement level. Recent answers focus on fecundity impairments brought on by postponement of fertility, the high opportunity cost of childbearing, and partnership dissolution ( bongaarts 2001; morgan and rackin 2010; quesnel-vallée and morgan 2003 ). From the purely demographic perspective, progression to parity 2 is critical because differences in fertility across developed countries are largely driven by differences in the probability of having a second child ( van bavel and różańska-putek 2010 ). Our analysis addresses the crucial question of why those who have one do not go on to have another. We highlight how parents ' experience of a first birth shapes whether they go on to have another child. Analyzing data from germany, a country that has had period total fertility rate below 1.5 since 1983, we find that people whose subjective well-being drops after the",

Along with the pulsing music and images of a fin slicing the ocean surface – from kid pranksters or a real shark – the line is once again being trotted out by officials on both the east and west coasts at the height of beachgoing season because of real-life shark visitations. An 18-foot great white shark buzzsawed through the front end of a kayak about 400 yards from pleasure point off santa cruz july 7. And the town of chatham, a cape cod resort, has barred swimming within 300 feet of seals, known to be a key delectation for hungry sharks. The cape cod shark hunters, which conducts research with scientists from the massachusetts division of marine fisheries and the woods hole oceanographic institute, reported two shark sightings july 3, and three other great whites the week before. The danger, however, is very slight, say a host of researchers, who are using the incidents to remind the public of its fascination with the ocean predator – and to shift the spotlight to mankind's global abuse of the species. \"the public loves to fear the idea of sharks and so the media play",

First, \" pop up from a lying position and stand still for three minutes. \" there's a video floating around of some nasa \" hijinks \" aboard the iss, and it's enough to make scientific american wonder if kelly stayed in outer space \" too long. \" the houston chronicle puts awe-inspiring figures up to match kelly's feats in its \" by the numbers \" gallery. ( don't worry, the picture accompanying the fact that he drank 193 gallons of recycled urine and sweat is pretty tame. ) on saturday, kelly tweeted a photo of what he says was \" one of the best \" sunrises he saw during his whole year in space. Usa today has put together a stunning compilation of what it calls kelly's \" raddest photos. \" ( national geographic features some cool images, too. ) nasa offers a list of the seven ways kelly will have to readjust to being back on earth.

The blind dissident was jailed after exposing forced sterilizations and abortions under china's one-child policy, and though his views on abortion are unclear, anti-abortion groups are among those seeking his support. His allies say that chen — who has also campaigned for the environment and disabled rights — defies american political categories, but will not be shy about saying what he thinks. Chen himself has made it clear that he is focused on his homeland. \" i have come here to study temporarily, not to seek political asylum, \" he writes in a new york times op-ed. \" and while i pursue my studies, i hope that the chinese government and the communist party will conduct a thorough investigation of the lawless punishment inflicted on me and my family over the past seven years. \" china, he writes, needs to restore the rule of law by confronting the communist party political-legal committee that has turned ostensibly independent police, prosecutors, and judges into a \" single, unchallengeable weapon. \" click for his full piece.",

Anthony list, are highlighting chen's work exposing forced abortions and sterilizations in china in hopes that it will help them with their current priority in the united states, passing legislation banning abortions performed because of a child's gender.

        "summary": "After several nights of protests — and clashes with police in riot gear — the mood was a lot lighter in ferguson last night after the missouri highway patrol took over from local police. Armored vehicles were absent, cars honked their horns in celebration, and capt. Ronald johnson, the highway patrol official in charge, walked with a group of peaceful protesters himself. He's a ferguson native. The owner of a pharmacy in the st. Louis suburb tells the new york times there is a simple reason for the change in tone: \" because they're not tear-gassing us tonight. \" more: authorities say they will release the identity of the police officer who shot unarmed teen michael brown today, reports abc news. The man \" unmasked \" by anonymous hackers as the officer who killed brown isn't a cop and never has been, according to police — and his stepmother. The stepmother tells usa today that her stepson works as a police dispatcher in a different city and doesn't live at her address, which the hackers released via a now-suspended twitter account. \" i guess i ' m going to have to sleep with my gun and put cameras on the house, \" she says. \" now i have to defend myself and i didn't do anything wrong. \" but while gov. Jay nixon's decision to strip local police of control was clearly popular in ferguson, st. Louis county prosecuting attorney robert mcculloch slammed the move as \" disgraceful, \" reports the st. Louis post-dispatch. \" it's shameful what he did today, he had no legal authority to do that. To denigrate the men and women of the county police department is shameful, \" mcculloch said, warning that the decision \" may put a lot of people in danger. \" the jarring images of ferguson police in paramilitary gear clashing with protesters has boosted efforts to curb giveaways of surplus military gear to local police forces, the ap finds. Rep. Hank johnson says he plans to bring in legislation this fall to tackle what he says is over-militarization of the police. \" our main streets should be a place for business, families, and relaxation, not tanks and m16s, \" he says. \" militarizing america's main streets won't make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent. \" supporters gathered not only in ferguson yesterday, but in times square and in cities across the nation.

The team failed to nab a spot at the rio olympics during a qualifying \" test event \" on sunday when competitors fell on the uneven bars, beam, floor, and vault, reports the guardian. Nancy armour at usa today calls it \" a shocking downfall for romania. \" the fact that romania had to attend the event at all after finishing 13th at the 2015 world gymnastics championships was \" a stunning embarrassment for a team that has been a gymnastics powerhouse for 40 years, \" she wrote in october, and the one that gave the world nadia comaneci.

During the deposition, cosby told a lawyer that leroy amar gave him seven prescriptions for the drugs, then called \" disco biscuits, \" with the full knowledge that they weren't for him. Amar, who was a part owner of a social club cosby frequented, wrote the prescription for a sore back, but \" i would not doubt in a minute that amar would sign a prescription to give anybody anything they wanted, \" says a former lawyer who once represented him. \" that's just the way he was. \" amar, who died in 2002, moved between clinics in california, new york, and maryland, with disciplinary records describing botched plastic surgeries.

        "summary": "Two women shared extremely personal stories of rape in the uk house of commons on the united nations ' international day for the elimination of violence against women thursday. Their stories left fellow mps in tears, but it was scottish mp michelle thomson, who represents edinburgh west, whose words are being widely reported. In her \" extraordinarily clear-eyed and articulate account, \" as quartz calls it, thomson said that the crime happened 37 years ago in the woods when she was 14, that she knew the attacker, that it happened \" mercifully quick, \" and that she went home and told no one. \" i was crying. I was cold. I was shivering.... I didn't tell my mother. I didn't tell my father. I didn't tell my friends. And i didn't tell the police. I bottled it all up inside me. \" ( see the video here. ) in the end thomson never told her mother, which she says was \" possibly cowardly \" but also \" an act of love \" to protect her, reports the bbc. She did feel a \" duty \" to tell her husband when they got married 12 years later, but she says it wasn't until her 40s that she finally sought help through therapy. She says that while her self-esteem was damaged for years, and that she felt \" spoiled \" and disgusted by herself, she now knows that rape isn't about sex but rather \" it's about power and control, and it is a crime of violence. \" and, she adds, \" i ' m not a victim; i ' m a survivor. \" her colleague, labour mp tracy brabin, said she was raped by a stranger at 20, reports the gazette and herald, but she says she was \" one of the lucky ones \" because he got locked up. ( this rape survivor worked with a man accused of rape. )",

The government will essentially argue that the id law is intentionally attempting to restrict minority access to voting — which, the ap points out, could prove tricky since, unlike other parts of the vra, it's not enough to simply prove that the effect of the law would be discriminatory. The supreme court recently voided the list of locations subject to the vra's oversight. But the justice department is also jumping into a separate lawsuit over texas'redistricting and arguing that it, too, is intentionally discriminatory, and that texas should be subjected to preclearance of its electoral maps once again, the washington post reports. \" we will not allow the supreme court's recent decision to be interpreted as open season for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights, \" eric holder said.",

Unfortunately, the ritual also helped spread kuru prion disease, a form of creutzfeldt-jakob disease ( cjd ) — a rare but fatal brain disease that can lead to dementia and works on a molecular level much like alzheimer's and parkinson's. Reporting in the journal nature, researchers say they've isolated the mutated gene that helped some members of the tribe survive the brain disease that at its height in the 1950s claimed 2 % of the population annually. \" several individuals right at the epicenter of the epidemic, they have this difference that we have not seen anywhere else in the world, \" says a study co-leader. \" this is a striking example of darwinian evolution in humans, the epidemic of prion disease selecting a single genetic change that provided complete protection against an invariably fatal dementia, \" the university college london researcher, who's studied kuru for decades, tells the guardian. To test the prion protein gene he bred mice with it and found they were resistant to all forms of cjd, not just kuru, reports the bbc.

Here we have investigated the protective role of this variant and its interaction with the common, worldwide m129v prp polymorphism. V127 was seen exclusively on a m129 prnp allele. We demonstrate that transgenic mice expressing both variant and wild-type human prp are completely resistant to both kuru and classical creutzfeldt – jakob disease ( cjd ) prions ( which are closely similar ) but can be infected with variant cjd prions, a human prion strain resulting from exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions to which the fore were not exposed.

The psychological thriller starring jennifer lawrence and javier bardem is generating buzz ( though apparently not cash ), with peter bradshaw writing for the guardian that it has officially \" joined the ' bad movie ' club, \" receiving an \" f \" grade from cinemascore. Critics, however, seem to like mother! a whole lot more ( 68 % on rotten tomatoes ) than the general public ( 42 % ). \" how could this extreme disconnect have happened? \" bradshaw asks. One of his theories, among others: \" audiences are shocked and upset in ways they didn't sign up for. Some unspoken, unacknowledged consumer contract has been violated. \" more: in the new york times, melena ryzik calls mother! \" the year's most divisive film, \" noting that aronofsky wrote the script in five days. \" i just pounded through it, kind of like a fever dream, \" he says. Ryzik talks more in depth with the director, as well as lawrence and bardem, for their take on a movie that starts off like a typical thriller and ends in \" flaming nightmare surrealism. \" but even \" if it alienates mass audiences, it could also be the slow-burn conversation piece of the year, \" ryzik writes. Rex reed moves beyond categorizing mother! as worst of the year — writing for the observer, he says it's perhaps the \" worst movie of the … century. \" reed calls aronofsky a \" wack job \" and slams his previous films ( including black swan and requiem for a dream ), but he says even those didn't prep him for this \" delusional freak show, \" an \" exercise in torture and hysteria so over the top that i didn't know whether to scream or laugh out loud. \" the only thing reed concedes: the film is \" indeed original \" and features moments of \" technical brilliance. \" he also advises viewers to ignore all reviews and just make up their own meaning. Not that that's necessary, as steve weintraub actually asked aronofsky what the movie is about for collider.

The std is now popping up in new british cities including london, and doctors are worried it may spread faster just as it becomes untreatable.

The spread is a \" further sign of the very real threat of antibiotic resistance to our ability to treat infections, \" says public health england, which has had only limited success in tracking down sexual partners of those diagnosed with super gonorrhea, reports the independent. \" the spread of high level azithromycin-resistant gonorrhea is a huge concern and it is essential that every effort is made to contain further spread, \" says dr.

Caused by the bacterium neisseria gonorrhoeae, gonorrhea spreads by unprotected sex, but can also pass from mother to child in utero.

Northern ireland has a near-total ban on abortion — it's only allowed when the mother's life or health is in serious danger — but a high court judge in belfast ruled monday that parts of the 19th-century law are \" incompatible \" with the human rights of women and girls, the guardian reports. Under the law, abortion is not allowed even in cases of rape, incest, or fatal fetal abnormalities, and medical professionals who carry it out can face life in prison. With this ruling, the royal college of midwives says, health professionals carrying out abortions in hospitals have been given some legal protection \" and a release from the fear of prosecution. \" \" in the circumstances, given this issue is unlikely to be grasped by the legislature in the foreseeable future, and the entitlement of citizens of northern ireland to have their convention rights protected by the courts, i conclude that the article eight rights of women in northern ireland who are pregnant with fatal fetal abnormalities or who are pregnant as a result of sexual crime are breached by the impugned provisions, \" says the justice in his ruling, noting that the assembly has been reluctant to loosen up the abortion law. The ruling came about as a result of the northern ireland human rights commission taking the department of justice to court, and the doj has six weeks to decide whether to appeal the decision.

The historic judgment, delivered in belfast on monday, could lead to women and girls who are the victims of rape and incest as well those suffering from fatal foetal abnormalities having terminations in northern irish hospitals. The royal college of midwives has welcomed the landmark judgement in belfast high court. Breedagh hughes, the rcm's northern ireland director, said it would give some legal protection for all health professionals faced with the possibility of carrying out terminations in local hospitals hughes said: \"today's ruling is extremely welcome. It now gives midwives and other health professionals legal protection and a release from the fear of prosecution. This will enable midwives to offer women who have a diagnosis of fatal foetal anomaly the appropriate care, support and advice that they also have often been denied because of the assembly's inertia. \" hughes said that the failure of local politicians to legislate in favour of some limited forms of abortion had put her members and other medical staff at risk of arrest and prosecution but northern ireland's attorney general later said he was",
            "London ( ap ) — a belfast high court ruling is expected to ease northern ireland's strict anti-abortion laws to make it easier for women to terminate pregnancies in some cases. Abortions are illegal in northern ireland except in extreme cases when a woman's life is deemed at risk from her pregnancy. Judge mark horner said monday that certain prohibitions violate the provisions of the european convention on human rights — cases where a fetus has fatal abnormalities or when a woman became pregnant as a result of sexual crimes like rape or incest. John larkin, attorney general for northern ireland, said he was \" profoundly disappointed \" by the court's ruling and said he is studying grounds for a possible appeal.

            "Ni attorney general considers appealing against judgment that could see women being allowed terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities, rape and incest a high court judge has ruled that northern ireland's almost outright ban on abortion breaches the human rights of women and girls, including rape victims. The historic judgment, delivered in belfast on monday, could lead to women and girls who are the victims of rape and incest as well those suffering from fatal foetal abnormalities having terminations in northern irish hospitals. The royal college of midwives has welcomed the landmark judgement in belfast high court. Breedagh hughes, the rcm's northern ireland director, said it would give some legal protection for all health professionals faced with the possibility of carrying out terminations in local hospitals hughes said: \"today's ruling is extremely welcome. It now gives midwives and other health professionals legal protection and a release from the fear of prosecution. This will enable midwives to offer women who have a diagnosis of fatal foetal anomaly the appropriate care, support and advice that they also have often been denied because of the assembly's inertia. \" hughes said that the failure of local politicians to legislate in favour of some limited forms of abortion had put her members and other medical staff at risk of arrest and prosecution but northern ireland's attorney general later said he was",
            "London ( ap ) — a belfast high court ruling is expected to ease northern ireland's strict anti-abortion laws to make it easier for women to terminate pregnancies in some cases. Abortions are illegal in northern ireland except in extreme cases when a woman's life is deemed at risk from her pregnancy. Judge mark horner said monday that certain prohibitions violate the provisions of the european convention on human rights — cases where a fetus has fatal abnormalities or when a woman became pregnant as a result of sexual crimes like rape or incest. John larkin, attorney general for northern ireland, said he was \" profoundly disappointed \" by the court's ruling and said he is studying grounds for a possible appeal.

        "summary": "Portland's police chief has been placed on administrative leave amid claims that he accidentally shot his friend, then lied about it, reports the oregonian. When questioned by reporters on friday, larry o'dea, a 29-year bureau veteran and police chief since january 2015, publicly admitted to shooting a 54-year-old man in the lower back during a hunting trip in fields, 380 miles from portland, on april 21. It isn't clear how the accident occurred, though o'dea, 53, says he negligently discharged his rifle. However, dave ward of the harney county sheriff's office, which investigated the incident, tells the oregonian that o'dea and other witnesses — several former police officers were among the hunting party — initially implied that his friend accidentally shot himself; o'dea also didn't reveal that he was a police officer, ward says. A mayoral rep says o'dea told mayor charlie hales that he had shot his friend four days after the accident, but ward says he only learned o'dea was involved last week. During an interview, the victim, who was treated at a hospital and released, \" made it pretty clear he didn't shoot himself. The victim knew who shot him. \" hales has placed o'dea on administrative leave \" pending the outcome of several open internal and external investigations \" from oregon state police, the oregon doj, and portland's independent police review division. The pair agree this \" is in the best interest of the bureau and the city, \" hales says, per the washington post. \" we need our police bureau operating at its best, and our officers can't do that when there's turmoil and confusion surrounding their leader. \"",

The lambda chi alpha fraternity was quickly placed on interim suspension after two photos from the party, both of which can be seen here, surfaced on social media, the new york times reports. The photos caused outrage on the san luis obispo campus, where records show just 166 of the 22,000 students are black, and an emergency town hall meeting monday night was filled to overflowing. The fraternity, which is being investigated both by cal poly and its national organization, has been ordered to cease all events and activities. The chapter apologized for the photographs but insisted they had been misinterpreted, saying they had been playing a game where different teams were represented by different colors and one student painted his face black to show he was on the black team. \" we are extremely sorry and embarrassed for failing to recognize the racial impacts this brought forth, \" the chapter said in a statement. Students said that even if the chapter is telling the truth, the fact that they didn't recognize blackface is offensive shows the college, where a fraternity wasn't punished for a \" colonial bros and nava-hos \" party in 2013, has a long way to go, the washington post reports.",

Still, ethiopia calls the project \" win win, \" and sudan wants the electricity it will be able to buy cheaply when the dam is functional in about 18 months. Egypt's opposition has blocked ethiopia's access to foreign credit, an official says, but ethiopia is plowing ahead, trying to meet the rising energy demands of its rapidly growing economy. \" with even less water, we will die, \" says an egyptian farmer. \" we can't survive. \"",

The president is considering a number of options, including a tax credit for companies hiring new workers, an infrastructure bank, clean-energy tax cuts, and revamping the unemployment system so that it pays companies to hire out-of-work people. Obama will also try to extend existing programs like the payroll tax cut. But no matter what he advocates, he ' ll be hard pressed to put a huge dent in unemployment, bloomberg frets, both because private-sector demand is so low and because he ' ll face opposition from republicans. \"the broad honest answer is that there's a limited amount that he can do that i know of, \" said a clinton-era chairman of the council of economic advisers. \"we've kind of done a lot of the things we know how to do. \"",

            "Obama, standing with krueger in the rose garden on monday, said he intended to reveal the much-anticipated new jobs agenda in a speech next week. That address, coming at the end of a summer of worsening economic news and sagging poll numbers for the president, is shaping up as a pivotal moment as obama tries to resuscitate his presidency with less than 15 months before he stands for reelection. And yet, behind the scenes obama and top aides had yet to reach agreement on the major tenets of that plan, and it remained unclear whether the president was looking for narrower ideas with a realistic chance of passing the republican-led house or more sweeping stimulus proposals that would excite his liberal base and draw contrasts with the gop. \"everyone's trying to read the tea leaves to see what the president is going to put forward, \" said rep. Chris van hollen ( md. ), the senior democrat on the house budget committee. Obama offered few hints monday. \"i will be laying out a series of steps that congress can take immediately to put more money in the pockets of working families and middle-class families, to make it easier for small businesses to hire people, to put construction crews to work rebuilding our nation's roads and railways and airports, and all the other measures that can help to grow this",
            "The ideas president barack obama is considering for his new jobs agenda could put hundreds of thousands of people back to work, and still have a limited impact in an economy that remains 6.8 million jobs behind its pre-recession peak, economists said. Among the options obama is considering is a version of a tax credit for new hires that could spur the creation of 900,000 additional jobs at a cost of $ 30 billion, according to an estimate by michael greenstone, an economics professor at the massachusetts institute of technology and former chief economist for obama's council of economic advisers. \"it allows the private sector to lead the economy toward the areas where the payoffs are greatest, \" greenstone said.

            "Obama, standing with krueger in the rose garden on monday, said he intended to reveal the much-anticipated new jobs agenda in a speech next week. That address, coming at the end of a summer of worsening economic news and sagging poll numbers for the president, is shaping up as a pivotal moment as obama tries to resuscitate his presidency with less than 15 months before he stands for reelection. And yet, behind the scenes obama and top aides had yet to reach agreement on the major tenets of that plan, and it remained unclear whether the president was looking for narrower ideas with a realistic chance of passing the republican-led house or more sweeping stimulus proposals that would excite his liberal base and draw contrasts with the gop. \"everyone's trying to read the tea leaves to see what the president is going to put forward, \" said rep. Chris van hollen ( md. ), the senior democrat on the house budget committee. Obama offered few hints monday. \"i will be laying out a series of steps that congress can take immediately to put more money in the pockets of working families and middle-class families, to make it easier for small businesses to hire people, to put construction crews to work rebuilding our nation's roads and railways and airports, and all the other measures that can help to grow this",
            "The ideas president barack obama is considering for his new jobs agenda could put hundreds of thousands of people back to work, and still have a limited impact in an economy that remains 6.8 million jobs behind its pre-recession peak, economists said. Among the options obama is considering is a version of a tax credit for new hires that could spur the creation of 900,000 additional jobs at a cost of $ 30 billion, according to an estimate by michael greenstone, an economics professor at the massachusetts institute of technology and former chief economist for obama's council of economic advisers. \"it allows the private sector to lead the economy toward the areas where the payoffs are greatest, \" greenstone said. In discussions with the president, obama's economic team has strongly backed a tax incentive for new hires, said a person familiar with the deliberations. Even so, the president's capacity to dramatically improve the economy is limited after an $ 830 billion fiscal stimulus and almost three years of accommodative monetary policy from the federal reserve.

        "summary": "Throngs of protesters rushed to the us base in bagram, afghanistan, this morning, following a report that troops there had allegedly burned a number of korans. Police estimate that more than 3,000 took part in the demonstration, hurling rocks through windows and chanting, \" long live islam \" and \" death to america. \" they also blocked the road to bagram, preventing commuters from kabul from reaching the base, the washington post reports. It was afghan workers inside the base who spread the word about the holy books. Several even managed to smuggle out half-burnt copies, which protesters displayed during the demonstration. An afghan official told the ap that two soldiers transported trash that somehow contained the books to a burn pit last night. Once they realized the books were in the pile, they rushed to recover them, burning their fingers; he added that as many as 70 books, including korans, were recovered from the pit. The top us military officer in afghanistan, gen. John allen, has issued a public apology, saying the books were improperly disposed of unintentionally. \" materials recovered will be properly handled by appropriate religious authorities, \" he promised, and ordered an investigation.",

Thank you, mr president. \" fire and fury: inside the trump white house review – tell-all burns all read more fire and fury: inside the trump white house was due to be released on tuesday. But after extracts were made public by the guardian, the white house was thrown into a frenzy. Claims in the book about trump's mental stability and fitness to serve were dismissed on thursday as \"disgraceful and laughable \" by the white house spokeswoman sarah sanders. Trump tweeted that he had never granted wolff access to the white house and had turned down his requests many times. Describing the book as \"phony \", trump said fire and fury was: \"full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist \". He said he had never spoken to wolff: \"look at this guy's past and watch what happens to him and sloppy steve! \" donald j. Trump ( @realdonaldtrump ) i authorized zero access to white house ( actually turned him down many times ) for author of phony book! i never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist. Look at this guy's past and watch what happens to him and sloppy steve! the president's twitter outburst followed a remarkable personal statement denouncing steve bannon, his one-time confidant, whom he castigated as self-aggrandizing and not a critical figure. \"steve bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency, \" trump said. \"when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. \" sanders said the president was \"furious and disgusted \" at bannon's attacks on his family, which included the claim that donald trump jr's trump tower meeting with a group of russians who promised dirt on hillary clinton was \"treasonous \" and \"unpatriotic \".

The 30 or so students were standing together inside the basketball stadium at georgia's valdosta state university when they were informed they had to go, reports the des moines register. \" they said,'this is trump's property; it's a private event. ' but i paid my tuition to be here, \" says a student who was booted from the premises. The agents told the students that trump wanted them removed, but a trump spokeswoman later denied that the candidate made such a request. \" there's no truth to that whatsover. \" regardless of who placed the order, the removal of the black students \" caused a stir, \" writes jennifer jacobs of the register. After the students were escorted from the building, valdosta police officers ordered them away from the premises. At another trump rally earlier in the day, at radford university in virginia, black students who were chanting \" no more hate! \" also were escorted out. As the roanoke times notes, a recorded message before the rally began informed the crowd that it was a private trump event and that protesters would not be tolerated.

Valdosta, ga. — there are different accounts of who made the decision to eject approximately 30 black students who say they were standing silently at the top of the bleachers at donald trump's rally here monday evening.

A spokesman for the secret service contradicted the students'statements that federal agents led them out of the building, saying trump staff and local law enforcement officials were in charge of handling protesters. However, valdosta police chief brian childress tried to clear up the confusion tuesday morning, telling usa today that he personally went to speak to the trump campaign staff and the local law enforcement officers helping with security to confirm who ordered the students out, and to ask why. \"these folks were told to leave the pe complex by the trump detail, \" childress said.

Phrases like \" possible partial meltdown \" ( from ap ) and \" assuming the possibility of a meltdown \" ( cnn ) are showing up in stories following a news conference by a government official, but interpretations of the risk vary widely. The reactors posing the most trouble are units 1 and 3 at the same plant in northern japan called fukushima dai-icha. Their cooling systems have failed, and authorities have taken steps such as pumping in seawater and venting radioactive vapor into the atmosphere. At unit 3, fuel rods were briefly exposed, which the new york times describes as a \" dangerous state that could lead to meltdown. \" about 200,000 people have now been evacuated from the area, though government officials say the public has not been exposed to dangerous amounts of radioactivity.

Forty-one years later, chun wook-pyo, 68, has made it back home, south korea today confirmed. He's \" the only crewman from those two boats to have escaped, \" says a rep for the seoul-based abductees ' family union, per the daily mail. And he's one of thousands of fishermen believed to have been taken by the north across decades, though pyongyang denies it. Some 450 have never returned home, reports the new york times. The escape, first reported last month, is rare; the times reports that eight fisherman are previously said to have made it back since 2000. And the ordeal doesn't necessarily end upon reaching home: according to the mail, south korean officials are typically suspicious of escapees like chun, fearing they could have been indoctrinated by the north and set free as a spy. They may also be concerned that the person claiming to be chun could in fact be a north korean agent. Chun was reportedly questioned for two weeks upon his arrival in the south before rejoining his family. While very few additional details were given, the rep tells bloomberg that chun worked as a truck driver in north korea.

The story first came to light courtesy of the pittsburgh post-gazette, which reported on a $ 750,000 settlement for chris and stephanie hallowich of pennsylvania. They had sued fracking companies after accusing them of destroying their land and endangering their health. The deal came with a non-disclosure pact, which is typical. Not typical: that gag order also applies to the couple's two children, ages 7 and 10 — and it theoretically bars them from talking about the case for life. Mother jones notes that industry lawyers pressed the point, according to the court transcript, and the post-gazette talks to a host of legal experts who have never heard of such a thing. It's these kind of \" bully tactics \" that are keeping the industry from spreading the word about the potential benefits of drilling for natural gas, writes steffy. This is why people don't trust the energy industry, he adds. \" what can it do about it? well, for starters, it could stop getting gag orders against children. \" click for his full post.",

It happens often in settling such cases. But the insistence that their two minor children, then ages 7 and 10, are also bound by the \" gag order \" is.

            "No, not this kid. This is a stock-photo child. When a property owner reaches a settlement with an oil or gas driller, it's not unusual for the company to demand that the plaintiffs in the case agree to a gag order that bars them from talking about the agreement. But a recent case in pennsylvania is unusual. That's because the gag order prohibited the 7- and 10-year-old children of a couple that sued several gas companies not only from talking about their specific settlement, but from mentioning fracking at all.

On the debate over hydraulic fracturing, in particular, the industry ceded its chance to lead the public discourse because it retreated to its usual posture of denial and opacity rather than transparency. In recent years, some companies have tried to change that, but the seeds of doubt have already been sown in the public's mind. And then, companies do things like this.

Several independent legal scholars and attorneys involved in the hallowich side of the case say they know of no other settlement agreements that gag the children of parents involved in legal settlements, and questioned whether such an agreement is enforceable. Jessie allen, an assistant professor of law at the",
            "No, not this kid. This is a stock-photo child. When a property owner reaches a settlement with an oil or gas driller, it's not unusual for the company to demand that the plaintiffs in the case agree to a gag order that bars them from talking about the agreement. But a recent case in pennsylvania is unusual. That's because the gag order prohibited the 7- and 10-year-old children of a couple that sued several gas companies not only from talking about their specific settlement, but from mentioning fracking at all. Ever. Chris and stephanie hallowich reached a $ 750,000 settlement with range resources corporation, williams gas/laurel mountain midstream, and markwest energy related to health and environmental impacts they say they suffered due to natural gas development operations near their farm in mount pleasant, pa. The family used the money to relocate. But in exchange, they had to agree",
            "When i speak to energy industry groups, i am most frequently asked variations on these two questions: 1 ) why does the oil industry have such a bad reputation with the public and 2 ) what can be done about it? one answer is that the industry needs to stop acting like it has something to hide. On the debate over hydraulic fracturing, in particular, the industry ceded its chance to lead the public discourse because it retreated to its usual posture of denial and opacity rather than transparency. In recent years, some companies have tried to change that, but the seeds of doubt have already been sown in the public's mind. And then, companies do things like this. Mother jones reports that landowners in pennsylvania recently settled a dispute with range resources range resources for $ 750,000 that related to alleged health and environmental damages from fracking on their land."

A federal judge last week ordered ivey and companion player cheng yin sun to return $ 10.1 million to the casino — the baccarat money plus another $ 500,000 won at craps by spending those baccarat winnings. But as the washington post reports, us district court judge noel hillman didn't find ivey and sun had committed fraud as the borgata alleged. What they did do is breach \" their primary obligation to not use marked cards in violation of \" new jersey's casino control act, per hillman. How the duo did so: edge-sorting. The post explains that casinos will give \" accommodations \" to high-rolling players, and ivey requested five. The end result is that he played at a private table with his companion, with a dealer who spoke mandarin chinese and used purple gemaco borgata playing cards that were shuffled with an automatic shuffler. The linchpin was sun's \" impeccable eyesight, \" as northjersey.com reports. A june new york times magazine article that featured sun described how she spent \" around a thousand hours \" studying nearly unrecognizable differences in the patterns of the cards ( this after losing a fortune gambling and spending three weeks in prison over an unpaid debt; read her colorful story here ). She would tell the dealer to turn certain cards 180 degrees, and that rotation would be maintained by the automatic shuffler. What they don't have to repay: the $ 249,199.83 in \" comps \" provided to them by the borgata. ( this poker showdown got a little testy. )",

Make no mistake, \" food babe is a business, just like kraft, and one that is far less grounded in science, \" continues francl.

And in \" almost all instances, \" the couples will get those benefits whether the state they live in recognizes same-sex marriage or not, an official tells the new york times. The changes include: the irs will now recognize same-sex couples immigration law will treat same-sex couples the same as heterosexual ones same-sex spouses of federal employees will get health and life insurance employees of private firms will be able to take leave to tend to same-sex spouses under the family and medical leave act. But the rights train will miss a couple stops; couples in states that don't recognize same-sex marriage still won't be eligible for social security or veterans benefits, the washington post reports. Those programs are governed by state law, though the white house will today call on congress to pass laws changing that. It's been a momentous week for gay rights. News came on monday that obama will sign an executive order banning discrimination against some gay people, and yesterday the presbyterian church's top legislative body voted overwhelmingly in favor of redefining marriage in the church's constitution as between \" two people, \" rather than between \" a man and a woman, \" nbc news reports.

The alarm-clock app sleep cycle gathered stats on one million users across 50 nations over nine months, and found that women aged 16 to 55 are getting more sleep than men, qz.com reports. But in most countries ( ukraine, portugal, and colombia excepted ) they self-report worse morning moods than do men. Why the grumpiness? well, it echoes earlier duke university research that women need more sleep, and will suffer mentally and physically without it, as australia's news network reported in 2013. \" we found that women had more depression, women had more anger, and women had more hostility early in the morning, \" said sleep expert michael breus at the time. Breus'solution: take naps of 25 or 90 minutes to rejuvenate the mind. \" the more of your brain you use during the day, the more of it that needs to recover and, consequently, the more sleep you need, \" said another sleep expert. \" women tend to multi-task... And so they use more of their actual brain than men do. \" a few years back, arianna huffington co-wrote a blog calling sleep \" the next feminist issue \" because overworked women are sleep-deprived. Indeed, the duke research indicates that women's lack of sleep is more likely to cause serious health problems including depression, stroke, and heart disease. According to sleep cycle, japanese women sleep the least ( 5 hours, 56 minutes ) while fins, the dutch, and new zealanders get the most ( 7 hours, 41 minutes ), and american women average just over 7 hours.

It's not uncommon for underground pipes to leak gas that gets trapped under several inches of frost in winter and moves sideways, they say, often into a house or building. Gas travels \" to the foundation and to every opening — water lines and sewer lines, \" said natgas consulting president mark mcdonald. \" if a foundation is porous or cracked, that is how it gets in. \" when trapped, gas only needs a spark to cause an explosion. \" unfortunately explosions are way to common and occur on a regular basis, \" he said. \" it appears to be getting worse. \" in fact, mcdonald spoke while investigating an explosion that killed a woman and destroyed 10 townhouse units last week in ewing, nj. A star-ledger report on that blast notes that aging us pipes — many laid in the 1950s and 60s — are corroding and often need to be repaired or replaced; gas providers can even run robots through the pipes to search for weak spots. \" it's not always how old the system is, \" said an engineering instructor. \" it could be how well they're trying to prevent corrosion in the pipes. \"",

Sadly, given obama's colossal lack of management judgment, that calamity may be the only catalyst that will reform the secret service. \" at talking points memo, josh marshall thinks it's a \" deeply f'd up \" assertion that should have been edited out.

Pierson promised to fix the \" frat-house culture, \" but she seems to have merely replaced it with a \" culture of concealment and coverup. \" the agency's refusal to be forthcoming \" makes it look as if secret service secrecy is not meant to protect the president's life but to protect an arrogant agency from embarrassment and reform. \" new york times editorial: pierson is clearly not up to the job, but even if president obama decides to let her stay, \" he has to insist on an independent, top-to-bottom review of the secret service, not one conducted by officials trying to protect themselves or their agency. \"",

The ministry of civil affairs plans to issue new regulations set of rules to prohibit orphanages from using naming conventions that make it easy for other chinese speakers to guess that an individual is an orphan — leading to lifelong stigma. The article explains that some institutions named children in their care for where they were abandoned.

Researchers found that regardless of caloric intake, people who had more early light exposure were the most likely to have a low body mass index, reports the los angeles times. As the researchers explain in plosone, \" having a majority of the average daily light exposure above 500 lux earlier in the day was associated with a lower bmi, \" and every hour that exposure was delayed coincided with a 1.28 unit increase in bmi. \" light is the most potent agent to synchronize your internal body clock that regulates circadian rhythms, which in turn also regulate energy balance, \" says the lead researcher, who notes that many people fail to get enough natural light in the morning, the telegraph reports. She says the finding suggests that workplaces and schools should have more windows, and employees and students should be encouraged to spend morning breaks outside: bright daylight provides exposure of 10,000 lux, and even an overcast day sees light of 1,000 lux. \" this is something we could institute early on in our schools to prevent obesity on a larger scale, \" she says.

But there are far bigger consequences being discussed as a result of disney's announcement this week. Details: bye-bye bundles? the move \" won't kill off the cable industry \" but it \" could make bloated pay-tv bundles obsolete, \" writes david lazarus at the los angeles times. He calls disney's venture \" the most significant advance for cord-cutting \" since the launch of hbo now, given that disney houses hugely popular brands including pixar, marvel studios, and lucasfilm. Not completely gone: reuters notes, however, that discussions are underway between disney and netflix that could see marvel and star wars films remain on netflix after 2019. New streaming battles: but if pay-tv is doomed, this could be \" the beginning of a new phase of the streaming wars, \" writes erik kain at forbes. He predicts more entertainment companies will launch streaming services to vie for your dollars, which is surely going to be \" annoying \" for consumers trying to juggle them. Netflix is fine: kevin lincoln at vulture writes that netflix should be relatively safe thanks to its seemingly endless store of original content. ( its first-ever acquisition will help, too, notes inc. ) lincoln takes a closer look at how netflix got ahead of the game, though it had no original content five years ago. And he, too, sees a future \" in which every entertainment conglomerate has its own service. \" what savings? what if you want more than netflix or any one streaming service offers? expect to pay for it in coming years. The ap reports \" the future of tv may well be a mishmash of streaming services that could rival the cost of a $ 100 cable bundle — but that are way more difficult to use. \" this could lead to more websites aiming to help viewers navigate their streams. Ditto: a post at tom's guide cautions that your wallet \" could take a beating \" in this brave new world.

That's because a strange old law is finally coming off the books — one that forbids dancing in clubs and most public venues after midnight, reports cnn. It dates back to the end of world war ii when dance halls were fronts for prostitution during the american occupation of japan. For years, police largely turned a blind eye to those in violation, though crackdowns picked up in the last decade after a series of drug scandals and brawls, notes the independent.

Yet, just a few minutes walk down the street, behind a nondescript glass entrance and down a flight of stairs, that same kind of dancing could get you thrown in jail.

            "The ban forbids public dancing unless the venue has a licence, and even licenced premises have to stop all dancing by midnight. The footloose-esque law was put into place after the second world war, in an effort to crack down on dancehalls that were often a hotbed for prostitution. Since then, japan has developed into a thriving and highly developed nation - yet the archaic dancing ban remained on the books for decades. Despite the law, dancing, even after midnight, was tolerated in the second half of the 20th century, with police turning a blind eye to the hard-to-enforce law that was routinely being broken. However, into the 21st century, a string of celebrity drug scandals and nightclub brawls led to a crackdown, with club raids once again becoming common. Fortunately, japan's night owls will soon be able to party without fear. A campaign led by world-famous japanese musician ryuichi sakamoto, calling for the abolition of the ban, gained 150,000 signatures. The new law was finally ratified last week, and will come into force next year. Until then, late-night dancing will remain illegal. The lifting of the ban was partly due to the upcoming 2020 olympics, with the government taking the necessary steps to make sure visitors have as much fun ( and spend as much money ) as they can during their"
