She says her brother is grateful and understands that their mom was just trying to keep him alive. Graham says she thinks the situation on monday would not have been as bad if more mothers had acted like her, but she understands that many may have been busy providing for their families — and there is only so much a mother can do. \" you can talk blue in your face to your children, but at the end of the day they gonna make their own decisions, \" she tells cbs. \" as parents we just have to follow through to make sure that's where they supposed to be at. \"",

His lawsuit claims a disciplinary hearing scheduled to decide his fate violates \" his constitutional right to due process. \" the college fix explains the unnamed student won't be able to call witnesses or cross-examine the alleged victim during the hearing. The school has already recommended he be expelled. The alleged sexual assault took place last march after the student met two women at a house party and went home with them. He had sex with one of the women that night before having sex with the alleged victim in the morning. The lawsuit states the student believed the alleged victim was consenting to sex, in part, because she \" talked about being in a pornographic movie. \" but she later texted her friend that she was still unconscious from heavy drinking the night before and didn't remember having sex with the student. The lawsuit points out the alleged victim never filed a police report ( she did talk to campus police, and her father later complained to the school ) and claims she later told her friend the sex must have been consensual because it sounded \" passionate \" even though she didn't remember it. The university of texas-austin released a report monday detailing how its officers deal with sexual-assault allegations, according to the texas tribune. \"trauma victims often omit, exaggerate, or make up information when trying to make sense of what happened to them or to fill gaps in memory, \" the report states. \"this does not mean the sexual assault did not occur. \"",

So it is with the wall street journal's obsession with attacking and misrepresenting the multiple cases that i brought against both aig and its former chairman and ceo, hank greenberg. At stake is much more than the particular cases at issue.

        "summary": "The tale of the demise of easter island's people may have to be rewritten. The story has long held that infighting as resources ran out was one of the main drivers of the collapse, but a new study published in the journal of pacific archaeology suggests a different scenario. Cnn reports on the \" unlikely method \" of examining the society via of some of the stone tools used to carve the island's famous stone figures: researchers performed a chemical analysis on four of the statues and fragments from 17 of the roughly 1,600 basalt tools, called toki, that had been excavated. The goal was to determine where the basalt had come from. There were three quarries on the island that were potential sources of the volcanic rock; the key discovery is that there was \" near exclusive \" use of a single quarry to make the toki. Here's the jump researchers are making from there, per a press release: lead study author dale simpson jr. Sees that as \" solid evidence that there was cooperation among families and craft groups.... The idea of competition and collapse on easter island might be overstated. \" but jo anne van tilburg, who led the excavations, cautions against coming to an overstated conclusion in this case. She says the findings bolster the view \" of craft specialization based on information exchange, but we can't know at this stage if the interaction was collaborative. It may also have been coercive in some way. Human behavior is complex. \" ( this separate study pushes the same theory but based on different evidence: obsidian. )",

Rickman had hinted at that fact in interviews, mashable reports, but he never revealed exactly what rowling told him — but now rowling finally has, thanks to a fan on twitter who asked her, \" will you tell us the piece of information that you told alan rickman about severus snape? or will that forever be a secret? \" as the independent explains, rickman once said that rowling didn't reveal the entire ending of the series to him, but rather gave him \" one little piece of information, which i always said i would never share with anybody and never have, and never will, \" and that helped him \" travel down that road rather than that one or that one or that one. \" rowling's response to the aforementioned fan explains what that \" one little piece \" was: \" i told alan what lies behind the word ' always, ' \" she wrote.

Yes, nunney's study in the proceedings of the royal society b suggests that taller people are at greater risk for cancer. The surprisingly simple reason? they have more cells, and thus more things go can wrong in those cells, explains the guardian. Specifically, the study found that cancer risk rises by 10 % for every 4 inches people are above average height — 5 feet 4 for women and 5 feet 9 for men, reports cnn. The findings held true for 18 of 23 cancers studied. \" now, you can't do anything about your height, but what you can do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware of this, and if they have any concerns, to get checked, \" says nunney. Cancers of the colon and kidney were among those with the strongest correlation to height. A researcher not involved with the study says it backs up previously seen links between height and cancer, but she said tall people shouldn't worry too much. \" the increased risk is small, and there's plenty you can do to reduce the risk of developing cancer, such as not smoking and keeping a healthy weight, \" says georgina hill of cancer research uk.

Rather, they were neatly boxed up sitting in a cart in broad run high school's shipping area — presumably a place where one would have thought to look before telling students they might face a retake. \" ups did not lose this, and we apologize profoundly to ups, \" says a school rep, per wtop. The rep says some mix-up happened when the exams were moved from the guidance office; the school had claimed it had video of a ups employee carrying the box, but it was actually \" a box that looked like the one containing the tests [ that ] went out the door at 3pm that day, \" the rep says.

Researchers told subjects a normal night of sleep consisted of about 20 % to 25 % rem sleep. Less than 20 %, the subjects heard, meant a worse performance on cognitive tests, while more than 25 % meant scoring well on such tests, the telegraph reports. Researchers duped these subjects into believing that sensors attached to their bodies were tracking their sleep quality. After a night's sleep, some subjects were told they spent 16.2 % of the night in rem sleep, while others were informed they'd spent 28.7 % of the night in rem. That was all made up, the smithsonian reports. Next, the subjects took tests involving adding numbers. Subjects who'd been told they'd slept poorly did worse on the tests, reports blogger eric horowitz. Those who heard they slept well did better, the independent reports. In other words, the subjects experienced a \" placebo sleep \" effect. Indeed, the effect isn't limited to pills: we can get placebo exercise, too, the smithsonian notes.",

            "Just thinking you had a better night sleep creates a placebo effect that can improve your cognitive abilities, a new study has found. Researchers at colorado college found students who were told they had a good night's sleep, even if they did not, performed better on attention and memory skill tests than those who had been informed they had slept badly. Research led by christina draganich and colorado college psychology professor kristi erdal involved 164 students who were told a new technique, which does not actually exist, would be used to measure their sleep pattern from the night before. Researchers randomly split participants into \"above average \" quality sleep and \"below average \" quality sleep groups. Students in both groups were also given a five minute talk on sleep quality and how important it is for cognitive function. They were told the average proportion of rem sleep a night was between 20 and 20 per cent. Participants were then connected to a machine they were told would measure their brainwave frequency and shown spreadsheets and formulas. Those in the \" above average \" sleep quality condition were told by researchers they had spent 28.7 per cent of their total sleep time in rem, whereas those in the \" below average \" sleep quality condition were informed that they had only spent 16.2 per cent of their time in rem sleep. The students who were told they got a good night's sleep performed significantly better in the paced auditory serial addition test, a cognitive exercise which measured their ability to listen and process information. The authors say what the students were told about their sleep is known as \"placebo sleep. \" the effect of that information was a placebo effect, which has to do with the person's mindset regarding his or her treatment. They concluded: \"these findings supported the hypothesis that mindset can influence cognitive states in both positive and negative directions, suggesting a means of controlling one's health and cognition. \" the study placebo sleep affects cognitive functioning is published in the journal of experimental psychology: learning, memory and cognition."

The certain approval of diaz-canel by members of the unfailingly unanimous national assembly will install someone from outside the castro family in the country's highest government office for the first time in nearly six decades, the ap reports. In what the ap initially called an \" unusual two-day process, \" diaz-canel will officially take office thursday; the new national leadership will be officially announced that day, the anniversary of the defeat of us-backed invaders at the bay of pigs in 1961. What to know: more on the process: the cuban national assembly has generally met and selected the president in one day. Its votes are nearly always anonymous and seen as reflecting the will of the country's top leadership. Cuba's constitution allows for any member of the 605-seat legislature to be elected as head of the council of state, but diaz-canel had long been seen as the overwhelming favorite. The new president will take over for the 86-year-old castro, who is stepping down after two five-year terms. The candidacy commission also nominated another six vice presidents of the council of state, cuba's highest government body. The successor: diaz-canel gained prominence in central villa clara province as the top communist party official, a post equivalent to governor. There, people described him as a hard-working, modest-living technocrat dedicated to improving public services. He became higher education minister in 2009 before moving into the vice presidency. Most cubans know their first vice president as an uncharismatic figure who until recently maintained a public profile so low it was virtually nonexistent.",

In response, the academy is attempting to — as the av club puts it — \" add seemingly goddamn everyone it had, for one reason or another, forgotten to invite into its membership. \" the actors, directors, and others invited wednesday include idris elba, eva mendes, oscar isaac, john boyega, ice cube, greta gerqig, michael b. Jordan, vivica a. Fox, the wachowskis, james wan, luis guzmán, kate beckinsale, park chan-wook, james hong, michelle rodriguez, and not one, not two, but three wayans brothers. Of the new invitees, 46 % are women and 41 % are people of color. If all 683 accept their invite, women would account for 27 % of the more than 7,000 academy members ( up from 25 % ) and minorities would total 11 % ( up from 8 % ). \"i ' m especially happy to be part of such a diverse group. I actually want to hang out and watch movies with most of the people on this list, \" arab-german director lexi alexander tells the los angeles times. \"to be honest, i cried a few tears when i started to get congratulation tweets in arabic. \" other invitees took to twitter to share similar sentiments. \"excited to use my vote to nominate talent that reflects the real world we live in — diversity, \" tweets brie larson, who won best actress at this year's oscars.",

        "summary": "For years, the los angeles zoo has been under a court order requiring it to exercise its three elephants on soft ground and not use electric shocks or barbed sticks on them. On thursday, that court order was overturned in a unanimous decision by the california supreme court that animal activists are decrying. A los angeles county superior court judge issued the injunction against the zoo in 2012 in response to a taxpayer lawsuit alleging animal cruelty. But in what the los angeles times calls a \" highly technical ruling \" overturning the injunction, the state's highest court said a taxpayer lawsuit ( which uses civil law rules ) can't be used to address criminal conduct. The taxpayer lawsuit began in 2007 when an la resident sued over what he said was abusive treatment of the elephants, also including the use of chains and drugs, courthouse news service reports. A lawyer who worked on the case, for free, for more than five years says he ' ll attempt to find another way to get a similar injunction against the zoo, or request that the state legislature overturn the ruling. \" i thought we had done something here to move the ball forward and instead the supreme court has allowed the zoo to take a step into the dark ages, \" he says. The supreme court explained in its ruling that by obtaining the injunction in such a way, the court did not allow the zoo to have a jury trial or the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The barbed sticks known as bull hooks have since been banned entirely in california, and for its part, the zoo says that it has never used and will never use them or electric shocks as disciplinary tools for its elephants, and that it will continue to follow the court order despite it being overturned.",

In august 2007, los angeles resident aaron leider sued l.a. Zoo director john lewis and the city of los angeles, challenging the expansion of the zoo's elephant exhibit. Leider claimed the zoo subjected elephants to \"cruel, abusive and illegal treatment \" through use of chains, drugs, bullhooks and electric shocks. In 2012, los angeles county superior court judge john segal stopped short of ruling that the zoo's treatment was inhumane but said officials need to take better care of the elephants.

            "Los angeles ( cn ) — the california supreme court on thursday reversed a ruling that ordered improved conditions for elephants at los angeles zoo, a setback for animal advocates who say the intelligent animals are being mistreated.

As usa today explains, these bridges aren't necessarily dangerous, they just need a lot of work, which has been priced at $ 76 billion by the federal highway administration. That amount will just get larger as the years pass. These bridges are, on average, 65 years old, and in 10 years, the number of \" senior citizen \" bridges will be one in four. \" you're seeing the aging of the system, \" says a co-author of the report. \" it really does parallel the [ aging of ] the baby boomers in a startling way. \" congress recently eliminated a dedicated bridge repair fund, meaning \" bridge repair now must compete with other transportation needs, \" the report states.

        "summary": "Sleeping more than eight hours a night? that may be too much of a good thing, because you're more likely to suffer a stroke, according to a study out of the university of cambridge. Researchers analyzed the sleep patterns of nearly 10,000 people ages 42 to 81 in the uk, and they report in the journal neurology that based on nearly a decade of follow-up and 346 reported strokes, older adults who sleep more than eight hours a night are 46 % more likely to suffer a stroke than adults who slept six to eight hours. That risk is actually four times greater when people went from sleeping for less than six hours at the beginning of the study to more than 8 as the years passed, per a eureka alert press release. The researchers adjusted for several factors, including age and sex, and their findings were strikingly consistent with what they found in a review of the combined data of 11 similar studies spanning 560,000 people in seven countries. But in terms of age and sex, the los angeles times notes the following: the link between the risk and sleep length was a little stronger for women, and the increased stroke risk was only seen in those eight-plus-hours sleepers who were 63 or older. The researchers caution that it remains unclear whether longer sleep duration is a symptom or cause of stroke risk. Says one, \" with further research, we may find that excessive sleep proves to be an early indicator of increased stroke risk. \" ( experts have just revealed how much sleep you should be averaging a night based on your age. )",

According to a july 2016 police report from peoria, reinking told officers he had confronted the singer in a dairy queen parking lot. In his version of events, \" taylor climbed up the side of a building and travis followed. However, when he reached the rooftop, taylor was gone. \" in other incidents the next year, after he moved to nashville, reinking allegedly threatened a man with a semi-automatic rifle and barged into a community pool and jumped in wearing a pink housecoat. Police say reinking's weapons, including the ar-15 used to kill four people at the waffle house, were seized after he was arrested outside the white house last year, the tennessean reports. The weapons were given to reinking's father after he promised to keep them away from his son. Police believe the father later gave the four firearms back to his son.

( ap ) — as an intensive manhunt continues for the suspect in a waffle house restaurant shooting that killed four people, police are warning residents of a nashville neighborhood to beware of the alleged killer. More than 80 nashville police officers continued to search for travis reinking early monday, authorities said. Agents with the fbi, the u.s. Bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives and troopers with the tennessee highway patrol were also assisting in the manhunt as disturbing reports about the wanted man's past behavior came to light. He was also added to the tennessee bureau of investigation's top 10 most wanted list. Reinking was nearly naked, wearing only a green jacket and brandishing an assault-style rifle when he opened fire in the parking lot and then stormed the restaurant, police say. In addition to the four people killed, four others were injured. Police credit a quick-thinking customer who wrestled the gun away from the suspect for preventing more loss of life. Metropolitan nashville police chief steve anderson said at a news conference that reinking, 29, was last seen sunday around a wooded area near an apartment complex where he lived. Authorities said reinking could be armed and weren't ruling out that he had left the area. He was believed to be wearing only pants and no shirt or shoes. Nashville police chief steve anderson said there was no clear motive, though reinking may have \" mental issues. \" he may still be armed, anderson told a mid-afternoon"

This week, however, thousands of viewers watched as the first photos other than sonar scans of the 623-foot aircraft carrier were shown live online, courtesy of the same ocean explorer who discovered the titanic, among other famous shipwrecks — and those pics show the independence is in remarkably good shape in its watery grave. \" there's very little change from when the navy scuttled it, \" robert ballard says of his team's documentation, in conjunction with the navy and the noaa, adding the titanic was similarly well-kept. \" the deep sea is the largest museum on earth. \" viewers saw such wonders as the independence's sponge-covered flight deck, a grumman hellcat fighter plane, and even the ship's name imprinted on its hull, all at the same time as researchers on the nautilus exploration vessel, who sent out two remote-controlled submersibles monday and tuesday to capture the pictures about 30 miles west of half moon bay. What the deep-sea dive didn't find: any evidence of the atomic waste rumored to have been sunk with the ship, per usa today, though a uc berkeley nuclear engineering expert tells the mercury news any danger posed by such waste would've long since dissipated. The 74-year-old ballard says he treated his newest subject with the same respect he does all his shipwrecks, leaving artifacts intact. \" taking things off would be like bringing a shovel to gettysburg, \" he says.

Political analyst sergey mikheyev blamed the attack on \" western subculture, \" cnn reports, which \" builds its matrix on the cult of violence, \" he said on state television. \" the one who has a weapon in his hands is right. This is a purely american approach to the matter. \" the death toll in the kerch attack reached 20 — 15 students and five teachers — after one of the injured died thursday, the ap reports. Health minister veronika skvortsova says most victims died from gunshot wounds, but the shrapnel-packed explosive device caused many horrific injuries, with some victims losing their legs or feet. Few details have been released on attacker vladislav roslyakov, an 18-year-old student at the school.

Discovered in uzbekistan in 2012, timurlengia euotica's large brain and ears used for balancing and hearing low-frequency sounds were \" almost identical to t. Rex, \" which also shared certain bone features, researcher stephen brusatte tells the bbc. Yet timurlengia was only \" the size of a horse \" and weighed less than 500 pounds. \" only after these ancestral tyrannosaurs evolved their clever brains and sharp senses did they grow into the colossal sizes of t. Rex, \" weighing over five tons, brusatte tells the telegraph.timurlengia was \" evolving features that would eventually allow t. Rex to become this super-dominant top-of-the-food-chain animal, \" he adds. \" tyrannosaurs had to get smart before they got big. \" researchers still don't have a full picture of timurlengia after uncovering 25 sections of its skeleton — they don't know the length of its arms, for example — but say the \" nimble pursuit hunter \" had long legs and was a fast runner. Timurlengia also had \" slender, blade-like teeth suitable for slicing through meat \" and \" probably preyed on the various large plant-eaters, especially early duck-billed dinosaurs, \" an expert says. ( one creature alive today has teeth like t. Rex. )",

The national highway traffic safety administration is now investigating two of the fires, both of which occurred after model s undercarriages hit debris on the road ( the other happened during a crash ). In a blog post, ceo elon musk says his company asked for the investigation and writes that \" if something is discovered that would result in a material improvement in occupant fire safety, we will immediately apply that change to new cars and offer it as a free retrofit to all existing cars. \" but the nhtsa tells the lat a different story: \" the agency notified the automaker of its plans to open a formal investigation and requested their cooperation, which is standard agency practice for all investigations. \" musk also says the company will increase the cars ' ground clearance to help prevent them from hitting debris, and warranties will start covering fire damage, even in the event of driver error, \" to reinforce how strongly we feel about the low risk of fire in our cars. \" to that end: \" we believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the model s, \" musk notes. \" since the model s went into production mid last year, there have been more than a quarter million gasoline car fires in the united states alone, resulting in over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries... Compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to tesla fires.

The town is home to fethullah gulen, an influential cleric who leads a popular movement called hizmet, and president recep tayyib erdogan blames his followers for the coup attempt that left at least 161 dead in overnight clashes, the new york times reports. \" i have a message for pennsylvania: you have engaged in enough treason against this nation, \" erdogan said early saturday. \" if you dare, come back to your country. \" gulen, a moderate muslim cleric who has lived in the us since 1999, was erdogan's ally until 2013, when the leader blamed him for corruption allegations. In other coverage: vox has more on the gulenist movement, which runs a large network of schools and supports interfaith dialogue, secular democracy, science, and a progressive stance on social issues. Gulen says he condemns the coup attempt \" in the strongest terms. \" the ap reports that john kerry says the us would consider an extradition request for gulen, though nothing has been received yet and firm evidence would be required. \" we fully anticipate that there will be questions raised about mr. Gulen, \" kerry told reporters. \" and obviously we would invite the government of turkey, as we always do, to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny. \" the new york times looks at how the fallout from the coup will make the region's politics even more complicated for the us and europe, which saw erdogan's government as a stable and reliable ally. \" the danger here is this could spiral out of control and turn into a full-blown civil war, \" says former us ambassador to turkey eric s. Edelman. Cnn reports on how many civilian supporters of erdogan stood up to the coup attempt, in some cases blocking military vehicles with their cars and even lying down in front of tanks. Almost 3,000 military service members have been arrested and almost the same number of judges have been removed from their duties in what appears to be a nationwide purge of gulen supporters, the guardian reports. Reuters reports that erdogan, who had been vacationing on the country's southeast coast, addressed thousands of supporters after flying into ankara's airport early saturday. \" this uprising is a gift from god to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army, \" he said. Turkey's prime minister binali yildirim says 161 people were killed and 1,440 were injured in the coup attempt, but a government source tells the ap that the figures exclude coup",

It's all dollars and cents: thoughtful or offbeat films costing $ 5 million to $ 60 million can make moderate profits at best, while blockbusters with international appeal are able to bring in sick money. Paramount's titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $ 200 million and earning nearly $ 2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like kiss the girls and in &amp; out dominated the paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like transformers: age of extinction, hercules, and teenage mutant ninja turtles rule paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \" you could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range \" at one time, says susan seidelman, director of desperately seeking susan. Now, she says, studios \" have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world. \" and few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$ 2 million films are vying for attention. So spike lee has funded a film via kickstarter, steven soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to tv for creative freedom. This sea-change has been coming for years now, as an old forbes piece shows, but some — including steven spielberg — believe hollywood will over-invest in blockbusters: \" there's going to be an implosion \" where several \" mega-budgeted movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that's going to change the paradigm again, \" he says.",

While cautioning that stories of defectors like lee have to be taken with a grain of salt, the bbc presents an interview with the now 41-year-old about a military experience that she describes as brutal on the body. Lee says she was 17 when she enlisted, and she was initially energized by the experience. That quickly gave way. \" after six months to a year of service, we wouldn't menstruate anymore because of malnutrition and the stressful environment, \" she says. The training was tough — essentially equivalent to what the men underwent, just slightly shorter — and they had to do domestic chores that the men didn't. Conditions were far from comfortable, she says: the women slept on mattresses made of rice hull that soaked up their body odor as they slept and sweated, making for an unpleasant smell. Showers were icy cold and compliments of a hose that pulled water from a mountain stream: \" we would get frogs and snakes through the hose. \" she says rape was common ( a statement she gave more detail about in this 2016 interview with the korea herald ), though it's not something she experienced, and that access to sanitary pads for those who needed them was extremely limited. Lee got out in 2001 and successfully fled to south korea about eight years later. The bbc notes that military service became compulsory for women in 2015; they must now serve from ages 18 to 25.

The cincinnati-based airline's goal is for fliers to fulfill their dream of having sex in the sky. President and ceo david macdonald once owned a large security firm, reports priceonomics. Then one day 20 years ago, he was discussing the mile high club with friends and he got the idea to create an airline to help people have sex. Today, he says thousands of surprisingly \" straight-laced \" couples have paid for private, hour-long \" flights of fancy \" on flamingo — which also offers sightseeing tours and has a flight school — for a $ 495 fee. They've included a couple celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary and a pair with eight kids who simply wanted some time to themselves. No need to maneuver around airplane seats: couples are treated to a pile of cushions where two seats should be, plus chocolates and champagne. As macdonald puts it, \" you've gotta think romance, not sex. \" that's why similar airlines have failed, he says — though the love cloud does offer \" mile high club \" flights in las vegas. \" they all tried to sell sex, not the sizzle. \" that doesn't mean the flight isn't awkward. The space is cramped, there's turbulence to worry about, and the pilot is only hidden behind a curtain, melanie berliet wrote for maxim in 2014. \" i have had a high heel in my ear once, been shot in the back of the head with a champagne cork, \" macdonald, also a pilot, previously admitted, per the new york daily news. \" thank god we wear headsets. \" ( these celebs say they're in the mile high club. )",

Researchers say changyuraptor yangi, a carnivore that lived around 125 million years ago, has the longest feathers ever found outside birds, to which it is very closely related. It's a lot bigger than any other \" four-winged \" dinosaur species known, reports nbc news. Researchers compare the creature, which was around 4 feet long and weighed about 9 pounds, to \" a mid-sized turkey with a very long tail \" and say that while it probably couldn't fly the way modern birds do, it could flap its wings and the feathers would have helped it land safely despite its size. \" so this does raise the possibility they could glide or ' fly ' in a primitive sort of way, \" a paleontologist tells reuters. \" the way i like to think of it is: if you pushed them out of a tree, they'd fall pretty slowly. \" ( another newly discovered dinosaur had bony \" wings \" on its head. )",

        "summary": "More than 40 technology leaders have proposed a radical solution for how volkswagen can fix its emissions-test-cheating vehicles: don't. Instead quartz reports the 44 signers — including tesla's elon musk — of a letter sent to the california air resources board on thursday suggest putting all the money and resources that would have gone toward fixing diesel cars already on the road toward speeding up production of emissions-less electric vehicles. \" cure the air, not the cars, \" they write in the letter. Earlier this year, volkswagen found itself in hot water when it was revealed it had installed software to cheat emissions tests in nearly 500,000 diesel cars sold in the us, the wall street journal reports. Quartz reports regulators have ordered volkswagen to fix all emissions-test-cheating vehicles currently on the road. In their letter, musk and the other signers argue it's no longer worth it from a financial or performance standpoint to keep trying to make diesel cleaner, and many owners won't get the fix anyway. According to the journal, they argue putting that money — as well as money from potential fines — toward electric cars and new zero-emission plants and technologies would reduce pollution 10 times what fixing the individual cars would. They also point out zero-emission cars have no way to cheat emissions tests, quartz reports. Neither volkswagen nor carb have responded directly to the letter, with a carb spokesperson telling the journal only that their \" focus has and will continue to be cleaning the air and advancing the cleanest vehicle and fuel technologies. \"",

Anna thomson and her son kyle thomson who says he was wrongfully suspended for throwing sandwich at prime minister julia gillard.

            "A high school kid in australia was suspended for two weeks for an attempted assault on prime minister julia gillard with a vegemite sandwich. But the kid says he's just a patsy set up to take the fall the second sandwich thrower. The whole thing started wednesday when gillard paid a visit to a brisbane high school for a routine photo op. But the day became anything but routine as she made her way through the excited crowd of pupils, and her security detail let down its guard just enough to allow the half-eaten lunch to be hurled in her direction. Here's the video that shocked a nation: school offiicals immediately named 16-year-old kyle thomson as the lone hurler and suspended him for 15 days. But in a shocking turn of events, thomson denies that he did anything wrong, and in fact claims that he threw himself in front of the real sandwich thrower in order to protect the pm from near-certain breading. Listen to kyle explain to an incredulous reporter how he knocked one sandwich out of the real assailant's hand and then reveals another shocking twist... There was a second sandwich. Naturally, the conflicting stories got conspiracy theorists roiling online, with aussies posting their own thoughts, hypotheses, and jokes to the riveting #sandwichgate hashtag.

About 5,000 of the hate crimes reported were categorized as crimes against persons, such as intimidation or assault. About 3,000 were considered crimes against property, such as vandalism, robbery, or burglary. ( some hate crime incidents are classified as both crimes against persons and crimes against property. ) the fbi is working with law enforcement partners across the country to encourage reporting of hate crime statistics. Next year, fbi personnel will provide training for law enforcement officers on how to identify bias-motivated incidents and report that data to the fbi's ucr program. Additionally, the department of justice launched a new hate crimes webpage, which has information for law enforcement on reporting incidents. Reporting hate crime data to the ucr program allows the public, researchers, community leaders, and local government to raise awareness of the issue and gain a more accurate picture of hate crimes. It also allows law enforcement agencies to develop data-focused strategies and preventative measures. Hate crimes are the highest investigative priority in the fbi's civil rights program."

Now he gets panic attacks, suffers from depression, and fears authority figures. After a disciplinary hearing, his mother tells the times, \" he just broke down and said his life was over. He would never be able to get into college; he would never be able to get a job. \" he's being treated by a psychiatrist, and his parents have launched a federal lawsuit against bedford county schools and the county sheriff's office. But the suit could face a hurdle when it comes to school drug policy: it also bans \" imitation controlled substances, \" defined as a \" pill, capsule, tablet, or other item which is not a controlled substance. \" in the meantime, it remains unclear how the leaf got in rmb's bag. The inquisitr points to concerns about \" zero tolerance \" school policies, noting that this month, a 6-year-old was suspended for shaping his hand like a gun — and it wasn't the first such suspension.",

Sherman says his fox sources have told him that in a murdoch family split similar to the one that preceded the departure of roger ailes last year, fox ceo james murdoch wants o'reilly gone for good, while brother lachlan and father rupert murdoch want him to stay. Sherman says lawyers who looked into ailes ' behavior are now taking a \" deep dive \" into list of allegations against o'reilly. Mediaite notes that sherman's sources have been spot-on about fox developments the past, though a fox spokesperson says o'reilly's vacation was planned before the allegations surfaced and he will be back on the air april 24. O'reilly said the same when he announced the vacation at the end of his show tuesday night, the ap reports. \" we all need r&r, \" said o'reilly, who told viewers he usually takes a break around this time of year and he booked this trip last fall. This year, the o'reilly factor has had its best viewing figures in its 20-year history, though around 60 companies have pulled ads from the show, which now only has about half as much advertising time as it did a few weeks ago, the post reports.",

Witnesses said some of the bombs exploded close to the bodhi tree, thought to be a descendant of the one that the buddha sat under when he achieved enlightenment, according to tradition. Police said there was no damage to the tree. Prime minister manmohan singh strongly condemned the blasts, saying: \" such attacks on religious places will be never be tolerated. \" the bodh gaya complex is one of the oldest buddhist sites in india. It was listed as a world heritage site by the un cultural organisation unesco in 2002. Correspondents say attacks on buddhists are rare in india, but there have been recent muslim-buddhist tensions in nearby burma ( also called myanmar ), sri lanka and bangladesh. The buddha, siddhartha gautama, went on a quest for enlightenment some time in the 5th or 6th century bc. He is said to have achieved it while sitting under the bodhi tree ( tree of awakening ). There are currently some 376 million followers of buddhism worldwide."

The european leadership network says that although reps from both sides may insist these training exercises — including a flurry of activity in march for russia and in june for nato, per the post — are against hypothetical opponents, it's clear there are definite foes in mind, and that alleviative measures need to take place asap to stave off a possible confrontation. \" russia is preparing for a conflict with nato, and nato is preparing for a possible confrontation with russia, \" the report asserts, adding that even though this doesn't make a real conflict unavoidable, it helps perpetuate tension in the region — especially thick since the russia-ukraine conflict. The organization's recommendation: tamp down the size and scale of said exercises, start hammering out a new treaty on limiting the types of weapons used along the borders, and publicly announce beforehand when exercises are being held ( russia is pointed out as a prime offender in this regard ). But a nato rep told bloomberg that the eln report \" misleadingly puts nato and russian exercises on par \" and that \" the scale and scope of russia's exercises are far beyond anything the alliance is doing.

Eyebrows were raised about the veracity of zhang wei's purchase after photos were posted online of zhang posing with the bottle and the manager of the waldhaus am see hotel; the swiss hotel's devil's place whisky bar has a 2,500-bottle collection. The prime condition of the vintage bottle, and the wording on the label didn't add up, said doubters. They were right. The bbc reports a series of lab tests were performed and returned all-around negative results. University of oxford researchers carbon dated the sample and say there's a 95 % probability it was produced between 1970 and 1972. And it's not even a single malt, as testing by alcohol analysts tatlock and thomson found it was a blend of 60 % malt and 40 % grain. Manager sandro bernasconi tells the scotsman, \" the result has been a big shock to the system, and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill. \" the repayment was done in what's likely the most expensive way possible: swissinfo.ch reports bernasconi flew to beijing to apologize and reimburse zhang. The daily meal suspects the bottle is one of a batch of fakes that were so convincing macallan actually purchased 100 such bottles in 2002. As for the story behind the man who felt comfortable paying so much for a nip of scotch, he's a 36-year-old writer of online fantasy novels who reportedly made $ 16.8 million in 2015.

Apparently they didn't, because cnn reports that the twinkies maker is now asking a federal bankruptcy court for permission to go out of business. That will mean 18,500 employees will lose their jobs, but cnn notes that ding dongs and other popular items could still survive under another brand, as hostess will be selling its assets at auction. Slate reminds us that hostess has gone bankrupt before; that time around, mexico's bimbo bakeries tried to nab it. Maybe they ' ll try again — although, writes matthew yglesias, \" the company's various packaged snack cakes are cultural icons, but also pretty unfashionable in the era of artisanal cupcakes. \" wonder bread, too, has suffered as customers gravitate toward healthier options like multigrain bread.

Still, norad sent up two us jets \" basically to let those aircraft know that we see them, and in case of a threat, to let them know we are there to protect our sovereign airspace, \" says a spokesperson. The six russian planes — two fighter jets, two long-range bombers, and two refueling tankers — eventually looped back toward russia. Hours later, canadian fighter jets intercepted two russian long-range bombers over the beaufort sea, near the canadian coast but again in the international zone. While such incidents aren't all that uncommon, one us official tells cnn that moscow was likely expressing its displeasure about a visit by ukraine president petro poroshenko to the us and canada. Elsewhere, two russian military aircraft entered swedish air space without authorization, reports the bbc.

        "summary": "Violence comes naturally to humans, but we are far less murderous than we used to be, a new study shows. Scientists in spain who examined the tendency among more than 1,000 mammal species to kill their own found that humans have been \" particularly violent \" throughout our history, reports the ap. Early humans killed each other at a rate of about 20 in 1,000, but got more violent during the middle ages when the rate shot up to 120 in 1,000. After studying 600 human populations from the stone age to the present day, the researchers concluded that \" lethal violence is part of our evolutionary history but not carved in stone in 'our genes, ' \" lead author jose maria gomez tells the guardian. Levels of violence are influenced by societal pressures and have \" decreased significantly in the contemporary age, \" says gomez. Still, the study published in the journal nature found modern humans to be pretty dangerous, killing each other at a rate of about 13 in 1,000. At least we're not the worst. That title goes to, surprise, the meerkat. \" almost one in five meerkats, mostly youngsters, lose their lives at the paws and jaws of their peers, \" ed yong writes in the atlantic. The meerkats were followed by two types of monkeys and assorted lemurs. The new zealand sea lion, long-tailed marmot, lion, branded mongoose, and grey wolf round out the top 11. Not surprisingly, violence was more common among mammals who share territory than among loners like bats and whales. \" our study suggests that the level of lethal violence is reversible and can increase or decrease as a consequence of some ecological, social, or cultural factors, \" says gomez. ( a study found early humans may have killed off real-life hobbits. )",

His campaign announced just before the wednesday filing deadline that it has received more than a million online donations, making him the first 2016 candidate to pass that milestone and the first ever to pass it so early, reports the wall street journal, which notes that the obama campaigns got there in february 2008 and october 2011. According to the filing, sanders ' fundraising is rapidly catching up with hillary clinton's, with the vermont senator raising $ 25 million in the third quarter of this year, not far off the $ 28 million his rival raised during the same period, although her second-quarter numbers were much higher, cnn reports. Most of clinton's cash in the third quarter came from the 58 fundraising events she headlined that asked donors to pay $ 2,700, cnn reports, while almost all of sanders'take came from the online operation, which had an average donation of $ 24.86. But he has had to spend money to make money: the new york times estimates that the sanders campaign has already spent $ 15 million, mostly on hiring staff and on online fundraising, without spending much on commercials or polling. Politico calls his haul \" eye-popping \" and notes that it undercuts arguments that sanders couldn't compete with a well-funded republican.

Soon, you ' ll be able to tell your amazon personal assistant to heat a mug of water, defrost a chicken, or prepare some popcorn. It's all thanks to the new amazonbasics microwave that connects to amazon's echo device so you can give it voice commands. The microwave was unveiled thursday in seattle, engadget reports. The appliance will sell for $ 59.99 and will ship starting nov. 14th, per the verge, which calls it \" a pretty dead-ahead 700w microwave. \" it features many of the standard microwave buttons, but most of the cooking presets are voice activated ( such as \" alexa, one potato, \" a command used by amazon's david limp a demonstration ). You can also set it up to automatically order products from amazon. \" what this microwave does is keep track of how many times you cook popcorn and make sure you never run out, \" amazon vp daniel rausch tells the wall street journal. Also debuted on thursday were other smart devices, such as an echo for cars and a home security system, as well as improvements to alexa like the abilities to whisper and hold conversations. It all adds up to amazon's push to \" unite a scattered industry, \" the wsj notes. Through products like the new amazonbasics microwave, the company hopes to get big manufacturers to use its alexa-enabled chips affordable household appliances. As the verge puts it: \" the point is to wow gadget makers with how simple, secure, and easy it is to integrate its alexa connection kit. \"",
