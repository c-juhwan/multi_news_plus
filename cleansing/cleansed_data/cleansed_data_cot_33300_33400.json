Once that happens, \" things don't look good for google, \" observes a post at quartz. \" according to data gathered by icomp ( pdf, p.2 ), no company has ever been cleared after a statement of objections has been issued. \" ( in the us, the ftc investigated antitrust allegations against google but opted in 2013 not to bring charges. )",

Forensic scientists have been looking for it since april, and now they've zeroed in on five possible sites, the bbc reports. All of them are underneath the convent of the barefoot trinitarians, a madrid church where cervantes was recorded as being buried — he had strong ties to the trinitarians. But the church has expanded since his death, making it more difficult to locate his remains, afp reports. To identify the possible sites, infrared cameras, 3d scanners, and ground-penetrating radar were used; now, researchers will search the locations, starting with the crypt, which features about 30 alcoves that could store bones. \" it is reasonable to think that if miguel de cervantes'remains were exhumed because of any works that were carried out in the church, they would have been deposited in one of these alcoves, \" explains the lead forensic anthropologist. The team is also seeking permission from the church to dig under the convent if necessary. If bones surface, they ' ll be compared to cervantes ' known characteristics, including three musket ball wounds he sustained during the battle of lepanto in 1571. If the remains are confirmed to be the author's, they will be permanently interred in the convent. ( last year, pablo neruda was exhumed — to solve the mystery of whether the poet was poisoned. )",

Finman's journey to teenage millionaire started with $ 1,000 his grandma gave him when he was 12. He invested the money in bitcoin — which then cost $ 12 each — and by 2013, his bitcoins were worth $ 100,000, cnbc reports. Finman cashed out some of his bitcoins to start online teaching company botangle, for which an investor gave him another 300 bitcoin. Flash forward to 2017, and finman's 403 bitcoins have a value of $ 1.09 million. Finman left school because he thought it was a waste of time and his teachers were too negative. He says they made his poor academic performance \" seem like a bad thing. \" since dropping out of high school, finman has moved to san francisco and interned at various start-ups. Now, with a million dollars to his name, he says he wouldn't advise a formal education. \" it doesn't work for anyone, \" he says. \" i would recommend the internet, which is all free. You can learn a million times more off youtube and wikipedia. \" despite analysts saying bitcoin is nearing its peak value, finman isn't cashing out.

That honor goes to navy doctor ronny jackson's detailing of trump's height and weight, which jackson reports as 6-foot-3 and 239 pounds, with a goal of dropping 10 to 15 pounds. The week reports that rumblings quickly began regarding the veracity of those figures, with msnbc's chris hayes inventing a term to describe the skeptical: \" has anyone coined ' girther ' for those who belive [ sic ] the president weighs more than his doctor reports? \" he tweeted tuesday. At slate, dr. Jeremy samuel faust describes the stats overall as unexceptional, but takes exception with what the height and weight produce: body mass index, or bmi. Trump's is 29.9, which faust notes is a slim 0.1 units — and just one pound — outside the obese category. Faust suggests trump could have fasted prior to weighing in to help keep himself in the overweight zone, but he doesn't have the same plausible theory when it comes to height. He says trump has been saying he's 6 ' 3 \" for decades — but most adults shrink an inch over that span.",

So zealous was his eradication that three of them turned out later to exist after all. Evans's vanished islands represent one of our most persistent responses to the physical world. The words \"fantasy \" and \"island \" have always been natural partners. An isolated piece of land in a watery vastness is an image that resides deep in the collective unconscious. Frailty and isolation, possibility and lotus-eating combine in it to suggest something fundamental about our place on this earth. John donne was wrong when he wrote \"no man is an island \". We '",
            "In the following week, geographers quickly determined that sandy island hadn't disappeared: it had never really existed in the first place. In 1876, a whaling ship called the velocity drew some dotted lines on the map at this point, noting \"heavy breakers \" and \"sandy islets \" in the ship's log. What did they see? there's no way to be sure. It could have been part of a reef, or maybe they were off-course. But their dotted \"sandy island \" was later noticed and enshrined by mapmakers, who probably conflated it with another sandy island that captain cook had noted about 260 miles to the east. The error kept getting propagated on new maps for well over a century, and the island is far enough from established shipping lanes that no one ever noticed it was gone."

Jared overton of utah says he parked his tesla in front of a business, behind a vehicle with a trailer, while running errands in lindon on april 29, per ksl. He paused briefly outside the car to answer questions from a curious employee of the business, went inside, then came out after a few minutes later to find his car had magically migrated into the trailer, per bgr. \"we were trying to figure out how on earth the vehicle started on its own, \" says overton. Tesla looked at the vehicle logs and concluded that overton had activated the car's \" summon \" feature, which it allows it to park without a driver. And the company lays the blame on overton, not on a software glitch. \" the incident occurred as a result of the driver not being properly attentive to the vehicle's surroundings while using the summon feature or maintaining responsibility for safely controlling the vehicle at all times, \" tesla says, adding the summon feature is in beta and drivers who use it agree to monitor the vehicle. Overton doesn't think he activated the feature, and a post at the verge raises the possibility that he did so accidentally while answering questions about the car. Even so, \" under no circumstances should a production vehicle autonomously collide with a parked vehicle mere feet ahead of it, \" writes chris ziegler. Simply put, he adds, the software needs to be smarter than fallible humans. The damage to the car was a relatively scant $ 700, but, says overton, \" i will not feel safe with my little boy playing in the garage or the driveway if there's the potential for a rogue vehicle. \" ( a man died when his tesla went into a pool. )",

Now researchers are reporting in the journal cell systems that different parts of our bodies can age at different rates and in different ways. When looking at the livers and brains of rats, researchers found that — because liver cells divide and are regularly replaced while most brain cells remain in tact for life — more proteins in the brain are affected by aging than in the liver, making it an essentially \" older \" organ over time. \" based on our findings, we would define aging as an organ-specific deterioration of the cellular proteome, \" one study author says in a eureka alert release. In fact they found 468 differences in \" protein abundance \" between young and old animals, and another set of 130 proteins showed age-related changes that may affect the protein's functions or activity levels. The research is important because insights into how organs age can shed light on age-related disease, notes healthline. \" an interesting open question is whether one organ can affect the aging of another organ, \" says the researcher. \" answering this question would give us a more comprehensive understanding of the aging process and how it relates to disease. \" ( odds are your heart is at least five years older than you are. )",

            "Image caption dozens of children have been admitted to hospital at least 22 children have died and dozens more have fallen ill after eating lunch at a school in the eastern indian state of bihar. The poisoning occurred in the village of dharmasati gandaman, 80km ( 50 miles ) north of the state capital, patna. The free mid-day meal scheme aims to tackle hunger and boost attendance in schools, but suffers from poor hygiene. Angry parents joined protests against the deaths, setting at least four police vehicles on fire. An inquiry has begun and 200,000 rupees ( $ 3,370 ) in compensation offered to the families of each of the dead. Twenty-eight sick children were taken to hospitals in the nearby town of chhapra after the incident and later were moved to patna.

        "summary": "Things aren't looking quite as bad for america's honeybees as they were a few years ago, but it is far too early to declare the crisis over, according to the annual survey carried out by the bee informed partnership. The survey found that beekeepers lost 21 % of their hives over the winter, which is the lowest percentage recorded in the survey's 11-year history. That's down from 27 % the previous year, but it's still a long way short of the 15 % or less that the us government has set as a goal, the ap reports. \" it's good news in that the numbers are down, but it's certainly not a good picture, \" says survey director dennis vanengelsdorp. \" it's gone from horrible to bad. \" the summer bee colony loss rate is generally lower than the winter rate, and last summer it was about 18 % according to the survey. That makes the total annual loss between april 2016 and march 2017 33.2 % of colonies, the second-lowest rate recorded in the last seven years, southwest farm press reports. Honey bee health coalition spokeswoman julie shapiro says things appear to be moving in the right direction but there is a lot more work to be done in areas including reducing pesticide exposure. Vanengelsdorp says the biggest factor in the improved bee figures appears to be a reduction in varroa mites, a deadly parasite.

The west australian reports the new rule — which will require consumers to use a check or electronic service such as a debit or credit card if a purchase goes over that amount — will take effect in july 2019. Exempt from the mandate will be transactions with financial institutions and those taking place between consumers for non-business-related purposes. The guardian notes that the measure is part of the government's attempts to tackle the country's so-called \" black economy. \" \" this will be bad news for criminal gangs, terrorists, and those who are just trying to cheat on their tax, \" said treasurer scott morrison, per gizmodo. It may also be bad news for australian small-business owners who rely on larger cash transactions. \" it's going to screw me — 95 % of my business is cash collections, \" paul thomas tells news.com.au. Thomas, who runs a security company specializing in armored cars and cash in transit, says the new rule is unnecessary, as there's a government watchdog already in place to go after money launderers. Others aren't as concerned, telling the australian financial review the $ 7,500 limit actually won't be that hard to circumvent: some say one could simply make a series of smaller payments rather than one big one, while others note the feds won't be able to keep track of such things anyway unless they put a high-tech monitoring system in place.",

        "summary": "A damning investigation by 60 minutes and the washington post on the nation's opioid crisis might mean trouble for president trump's nominee to be the nation's drug czar. The investigation shows how a group of congressional lawmakers, working with big drug distributors, weakened the dea's ability to stem the flow of opioids onto the nation's streets in 2016. The chief architect of the law is rep. Tom marino of pennsylvania, who has been nominated by trump to be the next drug czar. Details and developments: the whistleblower: the linchpin of the investigation is joe rannazzisi, who was once in charge of the dea unit that regulated the pharmaceutical industry. 60 minutes calls him \" one of the most important whistleblowers \" it has ever interviewed. Excerpts here, including: \" this is an industry that allowed millions and millions of drugs to go into bad pharmacies and doctors ' offices, that distributed them out to people who had no legitimate need for those drugs. \" and: \"the drug industry, the manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and chain drugstores, have an influence over congress that has never been seen before. \" trump weighs in: the president said he's looking into the report and promised to pull marino's name if he determines that the congressman did anything to hurt the fight against opioids, reports politico. Trump added that he'd have a \" major announcement, \" probably next week, about his opioid strategy. Trump previously said he'd formally declare the crisis to be a national emergency but hasn't done so yet. The lawmakers: the washington post has the nitty gritty on how the lawmakers, led by marino, crafted a law that \" makes it virtually impossible for the dea to freeze suspicious narcotic shipments from the companies. \" pacs from big pharma gave at least $ 1.5 million to 23 legislators who worked on various versions. Marino got about $ 100,000 and orrin hatch, who negotiated the final version with the dea, got $ 177,000. The story includes responses from lawmakers who crafted the final version. The change: for decades, the dea could stop drug shipments that it deemed an \" imminent danger \" to the public. That broad authority shrank under the new law, which now requires the dea to show \"a substantial likelihood of an immediate threat, \" a higher threshold. One result: a justice department memo shows that 65 doctors, pharmacies, and drug companies received suspension orders in 2011, compared to just six this year, per cbs news. Fallout: democratic sen.

So what could mar this momentous day? observers are still wary after copenhagen's failed summit five years ago, and there are signs of trouble once more. For one, some pretty important players will be no-shows: chinese president xi jinping and indian prime minister narendra modi won't be there. The post notes that together, their countries make up a third of the world's population and rank first and third, respectively, among the biggest carbon-dioxide emissions producers — the us ranks second. Plus, modi has in the past indicated a willingness to bow down and \" live with nature rather than battle it. \" there've also been relatively sparse donations to the green climate fund, a stash designed to help poorer countries fight pollution, the new republic reports. Still, ban is hopeful. \" climate change is a defining issue of our time, and there is no time to lose, \" he tells the post. \" there is no plan b because we do not have planet b. \"",

There are also undeveloped proposals to \"get tough on pharmaceutical companies. \" the president's frustration with the failure of america's longest war, the war on drugs, is understandable.

The evidence has never supported the contention that the death penalty is a greater deterrent to crime than incarceration. And a 2009 report from the colorado criminal justice reform coalition points to a large body of evidence that the incarceration and incapacitation of drug dealers has not deterred drug use or distribution and may, in fact, contribute to an increase in violent crime.

No such count is available for the thera explosion, which is why it doesn't make livescience's list of the 11 deadliest natural disasters \" for which reasonably accurate death tolls exist. \" it includes the 2004 indian ocean quake and tsunami, which hit indonesia hardest and killed as many as a quarter of a million people overall. Here are five disasters that didn't strike so recently: 526 antioch quake: the best estimate comes from john malalas, a greek chronicler from the byzantine city where the quake struck whose writings from the time put the toll at about 250,000. A 2007 paper noted that the temblor's may timing was inopportune as the city's population was swollen with tourists there for ascension day, resulting in an elevated toll. 1556 shaanxi earthquake: as far as earthquakes go, this is pretty much the worst. Believed to have been about a magnitude 8, it is said to have demolished a 621-square-mile region of china's shaanxi province on jan. 23 of that year, killing some 830,000 people. 1839 india cyclone: some 20,000 ships were wiped out by the cyclone and resulting storm surge that struck the port city of coringa on nov. 25, but that number pales in comparison to the estimated death toll: 300,000 people. 1920 haiyuan earthquake: the us geological survey believes that this quake that hit central china on dec. 16 of that year registered as a magnitude 7.8. Landslides were a big contributor to the death toll, which researchers in 2010 estimated as 273,400. 1931 central china floods: pegged by livescience as the deadliest of all natural disasters, this one spanned the months of july and august. The estimated ranges of those killed is a huge one, but the number is big regardless: somewhere between 2 million and 3.7 million were killed when the yangtze river flooded due to strong rains and melting snow, affecting some 70,000 square miles.

            "Credit: danny alvarez/shutterstock if aleppo's death toll is mistaken, the earthquake that hit haiti on jan. 12, 2010, may be a contender for the top 10 deadliest disasters. Even in a modern mass disaster, though, estimating the death toll is a tricky business. In the year after the quake, the government of haiti estimated that the magnitude-7.0 quake and its aftermath killed 230,000 people; in january 2011, officials revised the figure to 316,000. Those figures are highly disputed, however. A 2010 study published in the journal medicine, conflict and survival put the number at around 160,000 deaths. A 2011 u.s. Agency for international development ( usaid ) draft report from 2011 claimed even lower numbers — between 46,000 and 85,000. The disparities reflect the difficulty of counting deaths even in the modern era, not to mention the political wrangling that goes on over \" official \" numbers. Many critics of haiti's estimates argue that the government revised the death toll up in order to secure further international aid. On the other side of the argument, according to the columbia journalism review, were those who accused usaid of leaking the report to discredit the haitian government."

The transfer of 1,300 tons of chemical weapons from the danish vessel ark futura, including mustard gas and the ingredients for sarin nerve gas, will take place in gioia tauro, italy, an impoverished port and hub of the calabrian mafia. According to the ap, the cape ray will destroy the weapons in international waters — an unprecedented but, officials say, safe process that results in no vapor or water runoff. Ap explains the procedure, overseen by the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons: two machines in the cargo hold will mix the chemicals with hot water and other chemicals to make the weapons inert. This will take 60 days, and the resulting industrial waste will be disposed of by specialized companies in germany and finland. But italian locals aren't completely happy — they are concerned about the transfer's effect on the environment and their health, the local reports, noting that albania, norway, belgium, and france all declined to be the site of the transfer. And then there's that mafia connection. The daily beast calls the city italy's most dangerous port and notes that the mafia there, known as ' ndrangheta, has been linked to government corruption and the illegal arms trade; the relatively small city was, at one point, home to more murders than new york city. ' ndrangheta also handles more than 80 % of europe's cocaine — much of it through gioia tauro specifically.

        "summary": "Are women more likely to have better futures if they can terminate unwanted pregnancies? new research suggests this is in fact often the case: \" there is a belief that access to abortion is important for equal opportunities for women and for their financial stability, \" researchers write in a new study in the journal bmc women's health. To study this, the team interviewed 956 women who sought abortions at 30 clinics across the us, 182 of whom were ultimately turned away. Researchers checked in with these women through the so-called turnaway study a week after either receiving an abortion or being denied one, then a year later, and then again five years later ( this latter phase of interviews is underway now. ) some 86 % of turnaways kept their children, and 67 % of them were below the federal poverty line a year later, compared to 56 % of women who had abortions. That finding underscores the reason most cited by the women for seeking to terminate a pregnancy: financial instability. And of the 1,304 one-year plans made by 757 of the study's participants, positive goals ( i.e. I ' ll have a better job ) were found in 85 % of those who received abortions. Meanwhile, negative goals ( i.e. I ' ll be more stressed with another child ) were far more common among turnaways, who also reported having only 53 % aspirational goals, reports ars technica, which calls this \" an opportunity to reframe abortion as a public health issue for women who are suffering in measurable ways. \" per the researchers: \" whether or not a person has aspirational plans is indicative of her hope for the future. Without such plans or hopes, she misses out on opportunities to achieve milestones in life. \" not surprisingly, the study has its share of critics, like so. ( abortion rates are down across the us. )",

Around 41 members of the mawar sharon church were on the plane, and another 10 passengers were related to church members, a pastor tells nbc. The parishioners weren't traveling as a group or to attend a religious function, he says, but many families had been saving up money to celebrate new year's in singapore. He says a pastor has been assigned to each of 14 grieving families, some of which lost several members, including children, on the doomed flight. At a service at the pentecostal church yesterday, the head of the congregation urged mourners to find strength in their faith, the ap reports. \" if god has called your child, allow me to say this: your child is not to be pitied, \" he said. \" your child is already in god's arms. One day, your family will be reunited in heaven. \" more: three bodies were recovered from the java sea yesterday, and another three were found after the search resumed in better weather today, bringing the total to 37, the bbc reports.

        "summary": "The situation at iraq's largest oil refinery is a murky, smoky one: a refinery official on the scene earlier told reuters that militants have \" managed to break in \" and occupy 75 % of the baiji refinery. Though the iraqi army now says it has beaten them back and killed 40 of them, that claim could not be independently verified, the bbc reports, and the new york times says reports from baiji \" sharply contradict \" that assertion. It talks to sources, including a refinery worker and an iraqi army officer who fled the scene, who say fighters with the islamic state in iraq and syria are in control, troops have been taken prisoner, and storage tanks are burning. The refinery sits 130 miles north of baghdad, and there were reports that isis had taken over the town of baiji last week. The ap explains that the refinery exclusively feeds domestic needs, and accounts for a little more than a quarter of the country's entire refining capacity. Any substantial outage there could lengthen gas pump lines and spur electricity shortages, adding to the chaos already facing iraq. The times notes the refinery's seizure would also provide isis with \" a potentially rich source of income. \" ( it's already said to be rich. ) with isis militants in baquba, just 37 miles from baghdad, cnn takes a look at the implications. The city has not yet fallen, but militants have reportedly \" made a great advance \" on it, per officials, and many shiite families are fleeing. As cnn puts it, for prime minister nouri al-maliki, the importance of holding onto the city \" cannot be overstated. \" if it falls, things look \" dire \" for the capital. Where is president obama's head in all this? in the new york times'telling, he's considering selective airstrikes, most likely involving drones, against the militants. That from a senior administration official, who says the campaign would be a targeted one similar to operations in yemen and is days away at the soonest. But the wall street journal says the president has decided not to pursue immediate airstrikes, and will meet with congressional leaders today to discuss his preferred approach: a \" comprehensive strategy \" involving providing intelligence to the iraqi military and getting support from our allies in that part of the world. Iran appears ready to get involved: president hassan rouhani said today that the country will not \" spare any effort \" to protect holy shiite shrines in iraq from \" mercenaries, murderers, and terrorists. \"",

The san francisco international airport was primed for disaster, pilots tell der spiegel, because a landing safety system has been offline for weeks due to renovation. The out-of-commission system projects a plane's glide path, and would have warned the pilot sooner that he was coming in too low. \" a stabilized arrival in san francisco has become practically impossible, \" the pilot says. The faa says the system, which projects a plane's glide path, is \" not necessary for a safe landing, \" but the ntsb has promised to investigate it as a factor. Pilots also complain that san francisco's air traffic controllers instruct planes to perform exceedingly steep descents, in what they assume is a noise-reduction tactic, and that they're forced to land in rapid succession. The airport ranks first in aborted landings, and the asiana pilot tried to abort at the last second as well. Beyond technical considerations, onsite conditions are considered poor — though the ap reports that the weather was actually unusually fair, given the fog that frequently blankets the airport.

        "summary": "The next big thing in lawn-mowing technology could come from the makers of the roomba — but first, they're facing a fight with astronomers. That's because irobot's proposed device would use radio signals to keep the mowers from going rogue and moving off a user's property. Robot lawnmowers already exist, but they generally require users to install ground wire to restrict their movements, ieee spectrum reports. Radio signals could make things easier; the trouble is that those radio signals would be on the same frequency band as the one used by many telescopes, wired reports. The national radio astronomy observatory is taking up the matter with the fcc. The observatory's telescopes \" do a kind of celestial cartography that measures distances to star-forming regions with high precision, charting the course of galactic evolution, \" the group says. It fears that roomba's mowers would wreak havoc on its research. \" what's to stop the guy who spends thousands of dollars on this product from using it in residential areas near our telescopes? \" says a rep. From irobot's official response, via npr: \" as a realistic matter, irobot's proposed operations will have an infinitesimal likelihood of impacting any radio astronomy measurements in the band. \" the fcc will pick the winner in the debate; in the meantime, as the astronomers'rep says: \" it's telescopes against robots. \" ( either way, perhaps robot lawnmowers could cut down on drunken mower driving. )",

Per the washington post, the so-called \" nashville statement, \" a 14-point cheat sheet from the council on biblical manhood and womanhood endorsed friday by more than 150 evangelicals, outlines what churches should \" affirm \" or \" deny \" — including that marriage is a \" procreative, lifelong union \" between one man and one woman only; \" self-conceptions \" such as being gay or transgender aren't in line with god's \" revealed will \"; and the \" lord's arm \" isn't \" too short \" to save \" sinners \" who flout these mandates. One of the co-signers: family research council head tony perkins, who pressured president trump to declare transgenders unfit for the military, per the new york times. It's not enough to \" agree to disagree \" on these topics, the statement argues; the \" faithful \" must reject \" moral indifference \" and take a stand against \" homosexual immorality and transgenderism. \" nashville mayor megan barry, who usa today notes officiated some of her city's first gay marriages, blasted the guidelines on twitter as \" poorly named \" and \" not [ representing ] the inclusive values of the city &amp; people of nashville. \" reaction online to the #nashvillestatement hashtag was similar in tone. Rep. Ted lieu pointed out \" [ jesus ] said the greatest commandment is to love god &amp; 2nd greatest is to love your neighbor. \" the cbmw head has penned an explainer on why nashville's name was used and why the statement was issued — including one \" line in the sand \" article.",

As western culture has become increasingly post-christian, it has embarked upon a massive revision of what it means to be a human being.

            "Share this article: in a scene straight out of the old \"seinfeld \" tv comedy, three consumers are suing chipotle mexican grill inc., alleging the restaurant chain's menu misrepresents the nutritional value of its food products and provides more calories than advertised. The lawsuit cites the company's chorizo burrito that is described as having 300 calories, but an \"excessively full \" plaintiff contends the burrito \"couldn't have been just 300 calories. \" one of the best-remembered episodes of \"seinfeld \" centered around a yogurt shop that sidekick-neighbor kramer invested in because the product tasted so good but was supposedly non-fat and unlikely to add weight. As seinfeld and the other stars began eating copious amounts of the yogurt, they gained unexpected weight, despite the \"non-fat \" label in the",

This is particularly true at the rapidly growing type of restaurants known as fast casual, like chipotle, where you can order a burrito many thousands of ways.

        "summary": "Ask random folks on the street what the symptoms of ebola are, and bleeding from every bodily orifice is the one that's likely to be stuck in their minds — probably because other symptoms ( including fever, muscle pain, weakness, and headache, notes the cdc ) aren't quite as visually graphic and disturbing. The bleeding \" can take on a variety of shapes and forms, with the worst cases being people vomiting blood, having bloody diarrhea, bleeding from their nose and mouth and where the sun don't shine, \" angela rasmussen, a microbiology professor at the university of washington, tells livescience. Yet not everyone who contracts the illness experiences \" hemorrhagic syndrome, \" which typically sets in a day or two before death — only 30 % to 50 % of people afflicted will experience this type of bleeding. And just 18 % of the people affected by the current outbreak in west africa have experienced hemorrhaging, the cdc notes. Doctors understand the basic underlying causes of the bleeding, if not why only some people develop it: ebola can infect the liver, which then produces a blood-clotting protein that can \" go into overdrive \" and create clots that clog blood vessels; eventually the liver can't produce any more of these proteins, and blood vessel cells become inflamed and start to leak. Hemorrhaging symptoms typically show up between five to eight days into the illness, and mice in one of rasmussen's studies that came down with the hemorrhagic syndrome died within seven to 10 days of contracting ebola. She's hoping that further mice studies could offer clues about the possibility of genetic predisposal to the bleeding. Because not as many infected people experienced bleeding in the current west africa outbreak, the virus may have initially escaped detection. \" it was geographically outside of what we previously thought was the range for zaire ebola virus, and since without hemorrhage, it appears similar to malaria or typhoid, \" rasmussen says.

Prosecutors revealed an alleged al-qaeda propaganda video that featured militants describing how they used leaked documents to their advantage. Manning, prosecutors said, \" aided in the publication of those files, knowing that our enemies would use those files. \" defenders called him a naive and emotionally troubled young man who didn't get the support he needed from the military, the new york times reports. Manning's lawyers didn't suggest he was innocent of giving material to wikileaks, but they said prosecutors were \" over-charging \" a young private who hadn't threatened national security. Manning thought of himself as a whistleblower who \" thought he could make a difference, \" they said, adding that he was troubled by having to keep his homosexuality a secret for years. On jan. 16, the officer running the hearing will decide whether to proceed with a court-martial, notes the christian science monitor. A trial is likely on at least some of the charges, according to experts.",

Now a team of scientists in germany has confirmed that five types of olfactory receptors — proteins involved in the detection of odors — exist in keratinocytes, the major kind of cell in the skin's outer layer, or epidermis. ( by comparison, the nose has 350 types of these receptors. ) after cloning one of the receptors, called or2at4, the team exposed it to a synthetic sandalwood odor; sandalwood oil has long been used in eastern asia in the hopes of helping skin heal. Per their study in the journal of investigative dermatology, doing so triggered a higher concentration of calcium in the cells, which led to a higher number and movement of cells, which happens when wounds heal. They also scratched skin tissue samples and confirmed this healing effect, reports the conversation. But they caution that sandalwood should be used with care, as more research is needed to determine if it also triggers negative events. ( the human nose can detect an astounding number of odors. )",

            "Lemnos, greece people have been stigmatizing stink since the days when socrates wore smelly sandals. In the ancient world, the greek island of lemnos had a funk of mythical proportions. According to legend, aphrodite had cursed the women of lemnos with an intensely foul stench because they had neglected her temples. The odor was so bad that their husbands avoided their wives ' beds. Instead the men laid with women stolen from thrace and enslaved to the lemnians. This so enraged the lemnian women that they organized the wholesale slaughter of every man on the island on a single night. The real reason for the smell on lemnos may have had less to do with an angry goddess than with a sea snail. Lemnos was recorded in antiquity as a site where murex, an intense purple dye, was produced. The dye had to be extracted from a sea snail and processed using human urine. Women working in the dye production industry were cursed with a stench likened to garlic, rotting fish and bromine. A washington university archaeologist found she had to wear a mask to stand the stench when she re-created murex. The foul odor and deep purple coloration stayed on her for weeks afterward, even after scrubbing with detergent. Like cattle ranches in hereford, texas and sulfur mines in the ijen volcano, the smell of making money was"

Witnesses tell cbs that when officers responding to a report of a robbery arrived at the scene before noon, the suspect was in a tent arguing with another man and he was shot during a struggle with officers. A taser apparently failed to subdue the man as police tried to take him into custody. In bystander video of the incident, five shots can be heard. An lapd spokesman says two officers and a sergeant fired after \" a struggle over one of the officer's weapons occurred, \" the los angeles times reports. He says audio enhancement software will be used on the \" disturbing \" video of the shooting to determine what the officers said before opening fire. No other weapon was found at the scene, the lapd spokesman says. Witnesses say that during the struggle, two officers broke away to handcuff a woman who had picked up a dropped baton, reports the ap. Area residents tell the times that the man shot by police was known as \" africa \" and had been on the street for around five months, often being told by police to pack up his tent in the daytime. Police commission president steve soboroff tells the times that the incident will be investigated \" very, very carefully \" to determine whether the man really did try to grab an officer's gun, which he says would be the \" only explanation \" for the sudden use of deadly force.",

A defense department review, which calls the yemeni national \" ym-434, \" states that he was initially thought to be an al-qaeda \" facilitator or courier, as well as a trainer, \" but in the 13 years after his capture, it has been determined that \" these activities were carried out by other known extremists with names or aliases similar to ym-434, \" the guardian reports. Shamiri was captured in afghanistan in 2002 and is now thought to be an islamist foot soldier who had fought in various conflicts since he was around 16 years old, reports the miami herald. The army lieutenant colonel who argued shamiri's case before a parole board on tuesday said shamiri has \" remorse for choosing the wrong path early in life \" and \" has attended english and art classes, in addition to acquiring carpentry and cooking skills \" to prepare for life after gitmo, the herald reports. Shamiri, held without charge since 2002, is one of 107 prisoners still at guantanamo bay, but even if he's cleared for release ( as 48 others have been ), the defense department considers his homeland too unstable to release him to, the guardian notes. The wall street journal reports that the white house has rejected the latest plan to close gitmo because the pentagon estimated it would cost $ 600 million, which is considered too expensive.",

Contradicting officials, the wave expert says the water off the coast wasn't exceptionally rough sunday, and it wouldn't have mattered. Sneaker waves are common during winter in the pacific northwest and can be caused by storms on the other side of the ocean. They can appear suddenly even amid apparently calm waters. Ozkan-haller says thomas and his son wouldn't have had \" much space to run away \" due to high tide and may have been weighed down by heavy winter clothing. She says beach-goers need to pay attention and show \" respect for the ocean. \" ( a buoy noticed a wave that was \" remarkable. \" )",

        "summary": "Expectant moms who live close to fracking sites are significantly more likely to give birth to underweight babies, according to a comprehensive new study out of pennsylvania. And the closer they are to the well, the greater the risk, say researchers in the journal science advances. The researchers found that infants born within about a half-mile of a fracking site were 25 % more likely to weigh 5.5 pounds or less, reports science. The study found an increased risk for a radius up to about two miles ( three kilometers, to be exact ) from wells, but not much of a risk beyond that. The study is based on data from 1.1 million babies born in the fracking-heavy state between 2004 and 2013. Low birth weights are linked to later problems ranging from asthma to lower test scores, and the toxic chemicals used in the fracking process have long raised health concerns, notes the la times. \" i think i was surprised by the magnitude of the impact within the half-mile radius, \" co-author michael greenstone of the university of chicago tells the washington post. But, he adds, while fracking opponents may focus on that part of the study, supporters may focus on the lack of a risk for babies outside the three-kilometer radius. Still, given that 30,000 us babies a year are born within a half-mile and 100,000 within two miles of a fracking site, the results are noteworthy, he says. An industry spokesperson countered that the study fails to take into account factors such as smoking and alcohol use, and says \" it's dangerously misleading and inflammatory to suggest that natural gas development has done anything but improve public health. \" ( the epa is looking into fracking's effect on groundwater. )",

Maine's susan collins tells the new yorker that she's not ruling out voting for clinton, and she cites donald trump's remarks concerning judge gonzalo curiel's mexican heritage. They're \" an order of magnitude more serious \" than any of trump's previous controversies, says collins.

House speaker paul ryan said that trump's statement was \"the textbook definition of a racist comment. \" senator lindsey graham, of south carolina, said that it was \"the most un-american thing from a politician since joe mccarthy, \" and that republicans who previously backed trump should rescind their endorsements. One republican senator, mark kirk, of illinois, followed graham's advice and took back his support, on tuesday. Congressman bill flores, of texas, who chairs the republican study committee, a house policy group with a large membership, said that he wasn't prepared to endorse trump. \" i was incredibly angry to see mr. Trump question a judge's motives because of his ethnicity, \" flores said in a statement. But no matter how much they have condemned trump, none of these high-ranking republicans have said that they would consider supporting his democratic opponent, hillary clinton.

House speaker paul ryan said that trump's statement was \"the textbook definition of a racist comment. \" senator lindsey graham, of south carolina, said that it was \"the most un-american thing from a politician since joe mccarthy, \" and that republicans who previously backed trump should rescind their endorsements. One republican senator, mark kirk, of illinois, followed graham's advice and took back his support, on tuesday. Congressman bill flores, of texas, who chairs the republican study committee, a house policy group with a large membership, said that he wasn't prepared to endorse trump. \" i was incredibly angry to see mr. Trump question a judge's motives because of his ethnicity, \" flores said in a statement.

        "summary": "Police have arrested a 25-year-old man in los angeles in connection with a \" swatting \" prank that left a 28-year-old kansas man dead thursday night, kwch reports. Tyler barriss, arrested friday afternoon, is accused of making a false report to police. He was arrested two years ago in connection to a bomb threat to abc studios. On thursday police turned up at a house in wichita after getting a report of someone shooting their father in the head and holding their family hostage. In a recording of the 911 call, the caller says the man was also threatening to set the house on fire, kabc reports. The wichita police department confirmed friday the call was a swatting prank, in which someone calls in a false report to get a large police response to their victim's home. In this case, the victim of the prank — reportedly a response to a $ 1.50 bet on the video game call of duty — provided a fake address that sent police to the home of andrew finch. Police say finch at first followed directions to put his hands in the air when he opened the door. Deputy chief troy livingston says finch then moved his hands toward his waistband, leading an officer to fatally shoot him. \" due to the actions of a prankster, we have an innocent victim, \" livingston says. But finch's mother, lisa finch, says blame also lies with police. \" what gives the cops the right to open fire? \" the ap quotes her as saying. \" that cop murdered my son. \" lisa finch says police didn't give her son any warning before opening fire, and he was unarmed when he was shot. The fbi estimates there are about 400 cases of swatting a year.",

        "summary": "A 19th century painting that was looted by the nazis during world war ii and recovered by the fbi in pennsylvania has returned home to poland, reports the ap. It was publicly unveiled wednesday by members of both the american and polish governments in a ceremony that marked one of the latest recoveries of a cultural object by poland, which saw much of its cultural patrimony destroyed or looted during the country's wartime occupation by nazi germany. Poland's culture minister piotr glinski and the us ambassador to poland, paul jones, presented the small painting by polish artist robert sliwinski in warsaw; it was handed over to a rep from the national museum in wroclaw. The picture, showing a village street scene with the ruins of a castle in the background, was found after being put up for sale at an internet auction. Glinski and jones were joined by fbi agents who helped recover the painting from a town near philadelphia, acting on a tip from poland's government.

        "summary": "Seventeen thousand delegates from 194 countries are meeting in doha, qatar, today for the 18th un climate change conference, and pretty much no one is expecting anything useful to emerge from it. Here's what you need to know: the stakes are especially high this year because the kyoto protocol expires at the end of the year, and a \" meaningful extension \" is considered unlikely, reuters reports. \" ambition is very low, \" a spokesman for the african group of nations said. Russia, japan, and canada have all backed out of the treaty, and the us never signed to begin with, leaving the eu and australia — who together represent just 14 % of world carbon emissions — as its main backers. Even those nations want to \" carry over \" carbon they saved in excess of kyoto's 2012 targets — making new targets essentially meaningless, the telegraph reports. The sticking point for the us and others: kyoto demands nothing from developing nations such as india, or china, the world's top emitter. A deal involving them isn't scheduled until 2015. In 2009, industrialized countries agreed to provide $ 30 billion to help developing ones combat climate change — but they haven't followed through, the economic times reports. A new assessment shows that the us, eu, and iceland have committed half their share, or less. A total of $ 23.6 billion has been committed. Ironically, the talks are being held in the nation with the largest per-capita carbon emissions on the planet; the average qatari uses 44 metric tons of carbon a year. Similarly, delegates traveling to the conference will generate an estimated 25,000 metric tons of carbon. The un encourages countries to purchase offsets for their share of that. One reason for all the pessimism: these talks have a way of devolving into \" bad pantomime, \" the guardian laments. \" adjusting the placement of a comma can take hours. \"",

Oh, and it's family-friendly: kids under 12 get in for the low, low price of $ 250. And though applebee's promotes the fact that \" after 11pm, guests are allowed to make their way to the streets of times square to ring in the new year \" ( with the help of sonia sotomayor ), the head of the times square alliance tells marketwatch that as midnight closes in, patrons streaming out of venues in the \" prime viewing area \" may be instructed by police to move elsewhere.

            "The pitch: sure, you may think of applebee's as an affordable casual-dining chain, famed for its whiskey-flavored steaks and two-for-$ 20 dinner specials ( and also for its memorable part in the will ferrell pic, \"talladega nights \" ). But once a year, applebee's goes high-end. The chain's franchise-owned restaurant in the heart of new york's times square offers a $ 375-a-person new year's eve bash that's billed as \"a night to remember. \" ( those under 12 can get in for $ 250. ) but this isn't your standard applebee's bill of fare, the franchisee notes. The party, which starts at 8 p.m. And wraps up at midnight, features an extensive buffet, a \"premium \" open bar, a house dj, a dance floor, plus party favors galore. And for those eager to see the ball drop, the restaurant lets patrons \"make their way to the streets of times square. \" as for the vittles themselves, be prepared for \"a ton of food \" ( steak and shrimp included ) prepared by \"some fairly sophisticated culinary people, \" says zane tankel, who heads up all 38 applebee's restaurants in the new york metro area. Add in the décor and \"you wouldn't know you were at an applebee's for that one night, \" tankel says. The reality: sure, you can spend $ 375 on an applebee's meal and be close to the center of the new year's eve action. But you can also spend nothing and accomplish the same thing. That's because there's no admission to the times square festivities. \"it is totally free, \" says tim tompkins, president of the times square alliance. Even more to the point: buying a ticket to the applebee's bash — or to many other ticketed events in times square that night — may not even guarantee you a view of the ball drop. As tompkins explains, when it gets close to midnight, patrons who leave restaurants or other party spaces in the prime viewing area may be directed to move elsewhere by members of the new york police department ( nypd ), who are mindful of maintaining order and paying heed to revelers who showed up earlier in the day. \"security is much more tightly controlled and there are so many people, \" says tompkins of the event, which has attracted up to 1 million attendees in recent"

        "summary": "Adjust your trivia answers: the united kingdom has a new highest mountain. A high-tech measurement has concluded that mount hope, located in britain's antarctic territory, is now no. 1, reports the bbc. With the help of satellite data, cartographers with the british antarctic survey concluded that mount hope is 10,626 feet high. That nudges it past mount jackson, located nearby, at 10,446 feet. Researchers conducted the new \" photogrammetry \" measurements as part of an effort to update maps for pilots. It turns out that mount hope is about 1,200 feet higher than thought, the earlier calculation having been made back in the 1930s. \" we've got to bear in mind that this was a pioneering expedition, overland travel with dog teams, \" a bas scientist tells the telegraph of the first measurement. \" they were using relatively lightweight and simple surveying techniques in very, very harsh conditions. \" neither mountain comes close to antarctica's tallest mountain: mount vinson is 16,049 feet high, but it is not located in land claimed by britain. ( earlier this year, the us also found a bit of a surprise in remapping its arctic mountains. )",

Just three days into the $ 85 billion of automatic \" sequester \" cuts, republicans in the house of representatives turned their attention to the next fiscal deadline: the march 27 expiration of funding for government agencies and programs. Should congress fail to pass a new spending measure, the government will have to shut down most agencies and services - from national parks to the federal aviation administration. That would pile even more uncertainty onto the economy just as the worst effects of the sequester cuts begin to take effect in april.

        "summary": "The latest embarrassment for google street view: google has been fined more than $ 2,000 after its mapping feature showed an image of a woman's cleavage. A montreal judge found that maria pia grillo's privacy was invaded in having \" part of her breast exposed, \" gigaom reports, citing local media. The canadian woman looked up her house on street view in 2009 and found the picture, in which she's sitting on her front stoop, leaning forward and displaying her cleavage. Her face was blurred, but not enough to make her unrecognizable. She says she complained to google soon after and got no response, then sent google a letter arguing that she was \" at the mercy of potential predators \" thanks to the picture; the company says it never got the letter, ars technica reports. And so in 2011 grillo filed a complaint against google, demanding it blur the rest of her body and her license plate ( shown in the photo ), as well as pay her $ 45,000 canadian for emotional damage she said she suffered as a result of the photo ( including mockery from colleagues at the bank she worked at; she ultimately quit her job ). Google agreed to alter the photo but not to pay. A judge this month agreed that google didn't bear responsibility for the cruel comments grillo suffered, but ruled \" people do not forfeit their privacy rights simply by being in a location others can see them. \" google was ordered to pay grillo $ 2,250 plus interest, and $ 159 in court costs. ( in 2012, a man sued google over a street view image that showed him peeing. )",
