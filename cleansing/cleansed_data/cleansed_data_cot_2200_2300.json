        "summary": "Nurse nina pham is no longer the only american to contract ebola while caring for thomas duncan. A second health care worker at dallas'texas health presbyterian hospital has tested positive for the virus. The texas department of state health services says the worker reported a fever yesterday and was immediately isolated at the hospital. A preliminary ebola test conducted last night came back positive; confirmatory testing will be conducted at the cdc in atlanta, reports the ap. The dallas morning news adds that the new patient's apartment will soon be dealt with by a hazardous-materials team; it's apparently located in an apartment complex whose residents are being given fliers alerting them to the situation. The news comes as nurses allege the hospital was woefully unprepared to deal with ebola. The latest: texas health presbyterian hospital nurses anonymously released a slew of allegations yesterday by way of oakland-based union national nurses united; the dallas nurses aren't unionized. They took this approach in hopes of safeguarding their jobs while also being critical of their employer. Among their allegations, which the los angeles times notes are unconfirmed: that duncan initially spent hours in an area that contained as many as seven other patients. A nurse supervisor who later insisted he be put in isolation \" faced stiff resistance from other hospital authorities, \" they write. They also allege lab samples were mishandled in that they were processed \" without being specifically sealed and hand-delivered. The result is that the entire tube system … was potentially contaminated. \" the nurses also say that after tending to duncan, they were permitted to \" continue normal patient-care duties. \" they further allege an absence of protocol and say they were instructed to call the infectious disease department with questions — which they say that department couldn't answer. As for protective gear, they say they were given gowns that left their necks exposed. Per the washington post, a cdc official did say the hospital's approach to such gear evolved: \" they had masks first, then face shields, then the positive-pressure respirator. They added a second pair of gloves. \"",

Some skeptics say an hours-long spike in her swimming speed 27 hours into the 53-hour swim is especially questionable, but nyad's team says the only boost she received was from a current that she caught at the ideal time. ( she started and finished her journey at an average speed of 1.7mph, but a swimmer who analyzed her gps data says she nearly hit 4.5mph during the period in question. ) an expert who reviewed the charts says he believes nyad's achievement is genuine. \" many times that current runs west-east and you're constantly fighting the current if you're swimming north, \" he tells the ap. \" in this case, it was in the shape of an s, and the angle was almost exactly from havana to key west. \"",

The breaches -- amounting to about seven a day, or about five per year at every airport -- include everything from people who accidentally leave a bag on a checkpoint conveyor belt to those who purposefully evade security and get onto airplanes without proper screening. A tsa spokesman did not contest the figure, but questioned its significance, saying all breaches are investigated and resolved. The agency said it did not have a breakdown of breaches by severity. With about 25,000 of these incidents over a decade at more than 450 tsa-regulated airports, this amounts to just over five such incidents per airport per year, according to the tsa. The 25,000 breaches include: -- 14,322 breaches into secure entries, passages or other means of access to the secure side of the airport. -- approximately 6,000 breaches involving a tsa screener failing to screen a passenger or a passenger's carry-on property, or doing either improperly. -- 2,616 instances involving an individual getting past the checkpoint or exit lane without submitting to all screening and inspections.

Jason chaffetz, r-utah, reminded the committee that terrorists only need to slip through security once to cause serious damage, while reprimanding the tsa for doing more to appear secure than actually be secure. \" a lot of what we have been participating in here, in my opinion, has been security theater, \" chaffetz said, \" and has not truly done the job to secure the airports to the degree we need to. \" another report from the government accountability office said that only 17 percent of the nation's airports have received joint vulnerability assessments, which chaffetz said was \" not acceptable. \" the tsa has come under heavy criticism in recent months for using pat downs and body scanning machines which some passengers say makes them feel uncomfortable and violates their privacy. \" it's inadequate, \" rep. Paul gosar, r-ariz., said. \" because i can point to you that we can take a grandmother and strip her down, because it must be grimacing that she's going through terminal cancer, and yet we also have",
            "Washington ( cnn ) -- the nation's airports have suffered more than 25,000 security breaches since november 2001, according to a house committee, citing information it says it received from the transportation security administration. The breaches -- amounting to about seven a day, or about five per year at every airport -- include everything from people who accidentally leave a bag on a checkpoint conveyor belt to those who purposefully evade security and get onto airplanes without proper screening. A tsa spokesman did not contest the figure, but questioned its significance, saying all breaches are investigated and resolved. The agency said it did not have a breakdown of breaches by severity. With about 25,000 of these incidents over a decade at more than 450 tsa-regulated airports, this amounts to just over five such incidents per airport per year, according to the tsa. The 25,000 breaches include: -- 14,322 breaches into secure entries, passages or other means of access to the secure side of the airport. -- approximately 6,000 breaches involving a tsa screener failing to screen a passenger or a passenger's carry-on property, or doing either improperly. -- 2,616 instances involving an individual getting past the checkpoint or exit lane without submitting to all screening and inspections. Some 1,388 of these have occurred at the perimeter areas of airports. The information was released by the house oversight"

            "Lee jin-gyu fell for his'dakimakura ' - a kind of large, huggable pillow from japan, often with a picture of a popular anime character printed on the side. In lee's case, his beloved pillow has an image of fate testarossa, from the ' magical girl ' anime series mahou shoujo lyrical nanoha. Now the 28-year-old otaku ( a japanese term that roughly translates to somewhere between ' obsessive ' and ' nerd ' ) has wed the pillow in a special ceremony, after fitting it out with a wedding dress for the service in front of a local priest. Their nuptials were eagerly chronicled by the local media. ' he is completely obsessed with this pillow and takes it everywhere,'said one friend.'they go out to the park or the funfair where it will go on all the rides with him. Then when he goes out to eat he takes it with him and it gets its own seat and its own meal,'they added. The pillow marriage is not the first similarly-themed unusual marriage in recent times - it comes after a japanese otaku married his virtual girlfriend nene anegasaki, a character who only exists in the nintendo ds game love plus, last november.",

Algerian special forces continue to surround the site, a local insider tells reuters, adding that 30 hostages and 11 militants have been killed.

Authorities have called for calm and are \" reluctant to say anything to encourage the idea that there is any kind of pattern behind the three attacks, \" notes hugh schofield at the bbc. \" but many people will be asking themselves if there is not some copycat effect being played out, \" he writes. \" also, even if it is established the car attacks were the work of unbalanced individuals, might not islamist propaganda have played some role in pushing them to the act? \"",

        "summary": "Oscar pistorius broke his radio silence last night by appearing on twitter with quotations about love, religious feeling, and a possible allusion to suicide, the telegraph reports. In his first tweets since killing girlfriend reeva steenkamp last year, pistorius started with a quote from psalms 34: 18: \" the lord is close to the brokenhearted. \" he then posted a collage of photos of himself with disabled children, and followed with a photographed excerpt from man's search for meaning by holocaust survivor victor frankl. It read in part: \" in a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist of ending his sufferings in the right way — an honorable way — in such a position a man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. \" this seeming reference to suicide recalls a court-ordered evaluation he received last month, which warned that pistorius was having suicidal thoughts that could grow serious if left untreated. The daily news reports that in his last tweet yesterday, pistorius posted a photo of a lake with the words: \" lord, today i ask that you bathe those who live in pain in the river of your healing. Amen. \" the telegraph notes that these could be fake tweets — pistorius ' account has been hacked before — but they're in sync with his legal strategy of presenting himself as a religious person who has given to society. Final arguments in his case are due to begin on august 8.",

Researchers looked at 12,665 music industry deaths since 1950 and found that the average male musician lives just into his late 50s, while the average female musician lives only into her early 60s, the wall street journal reports. Compare that to the average age of death for american men ( 75 ) and women ( 80 ) who are not in the industry. The study found that the rates of suicide, homicide, and fatal accidents are all significantly higher among rock stars than among the general population, the lead researcher writes at the conversation. \" across the seven decades studied, popular musicians ' lifespans were up to 25 years shorter than the comparable us population, \" she writes. Why? she thinks it has to do with the lifestyle. \" the industry itself actually supports outrageous behavior. Drugs are very prevalent — young musicians often take uppers to perform and then party all night with alcohol and drugs, \" she tells the journal. Add that to the general stress of touring, and you have a recipe for disaster — particularly because the industry doesn't provide enough emotional support, she says. Rock stars \" dream of being at the peak and that all of their psychological problems will somehow be relieved by adoration and squillions of dollars. What they actually come to is a sense of emptiness and an incredibly demanding lifestyle, where everybody is telling them what to do. \" ( lonely people also may not live as long. )",

            "Art is a cry of distress from those who live out within themselves the destiny of humanity … inside them turns the movement of the world; only an echo of it leaks out – the work of art arnold schoenberg, 1910. Austrian composer arnold schoenberg, like many gifted artists throughout history, suffered for his art. Popular artists of the modern era have kept this tradition alive. For all the superficial glamour of the pop music world, let us not delude ourselves - today's popular music scene is brutal. The \"pop-cultural scrap heap \", to borrow journalist drew magary's term, is piled high with the dead or broken bodies of young musicians whose personal and musical aspirations collided with the aspirations of those occupying the commercial edifices erected around them, which turn them into income-generating commodities whose role is to satisfy capricious and ever-changing consumer demands. Many of those musicians end up feeling suffocated, caged and possessed by their minders, exploiters and fans. And many end up dead. How big a problem is the pop music industry, really? the rock scene is a volatile mix of glamour, instant wealth, risk-taking, rebellion and psychological distress accompanied by taken-for-granted assumptions that pop musicians will live dangerously, abuse substances and die early.

The freestanding marker is expected to be unveiled on juneteenth. \" the slaves of that time and place helped build city hall, \" one city councilman says. \" their lives should be celebrated and their deaths should be mourned. \" new york life and jpmorgan chase are among the many companies that profited from the city's slave trade, which dates back to 1626 — two years after dutch settlers first arrived. When the city's population reached 5,000 in 1700, roughly 750 were slaves, and over the next 50 years thousands of slaves helped build the port, major roads, and even the wall after which wall street is named. One estimate suggests there was a slave in at least 40 % of the city's white households, reports smithsonian. The slave market itself opened in 1711 and ran for 51 years; it's believed that thousands of men, women, and children passed through, with the market able to hold roughly 50 men at a time. It was an \" ugly experience, \" according to one historian: \" some of the male slaves were asked to flex in various ways to show how sturdy they were. And the females were touched in private places. \" the slave market dissolved before the abolition of slavery; by blocking river views it was bringing down local real-estate values.

Sprinter dutee chand, 19, will not be barred from competition following today's interim ruling by a sports appeals court, which found there wasn't sufficient evidence to conclude athletes with her medical condition have a \" significant performance advantage. \" that condition: hyperandrogenism, which results in unusually high levels of testosterone. In chand's case, her level was beyond what the international association of athletics federations set in 2011 as the limit for female athletes; she was last year prohibited from running against women and appealed. Chand had declined to suppress her levels via drugs or surgery; at least four other female olympians have had surgery to remove internal testes, reports the new york times. The court of arbitration for sport in switzerland suspended the iaaf's regulations on the matter, and gave the iaaf until july 24, 2017, to come up with scientific proof that there is a \" quantitative relationship between enhanced testosterone levels and improved athletic performance in hyperandrogenic athletes, \" per the times and the ap. If the iaaf can't, its hyperandrogenism rules will be void.

What they found last week shocked them: a few varieties of fish and crustaceans alive and well in the dark, narrow wedge of cold seawater trapped between ice and a rocky sea floor. But what on earth are they eating? even the sea floor sediment, comprised of mainly quartz, holds little nutritional value, reports scientific american, and life in these conditions is so barren even the water is crystal clear. To reach the previously unreachable place, scientists used the specially-designed and super skinny remotely-operated robotic vehicle called deep-scini, which boasts sapphire-shielded cameras, a grabber arm, water-samplers, and more. Microbiologists are now heading home with water and mud samples to sort out just what drives this unlikely ecosystem. Could methane, ammonium, or some other form of chemical energy actually sustain life down there? either way, this is the closest to the south pole scientists have documented marine life, reports nbc news, and it suggests that complex life really can thrive in the harshest conditions.

As we reported tuesday, ricketts, a republican, vetoed the legislation flanked by law enforcement personnel, murder victims ' family members and state lawmakers who support capital punishment. Opposition to the death penalty in the conservative state came from republicans who were against it for religious or fiscal reasons, as well as from democrats and independents. \" the efforts and arguments of nebraska conservatives are part of an emerging trend in the republican party, evidenced by the involvement of conservative republicans in legislative efforts to repeal the death penalty in other states, such as kansas, kentucky, south dakota, montana, and wyoming, \" robert dunham, executive director of the death penalty information center, said in a statement. Those who opposed capital punishment in nebraska point out that",

Banks, a member of the chippewa tribe who was born on the leech lake indian reservation in minnesota, died of complications from pneumonia 10 days after undergoing open-heart surgery, the star tribune reports. He came to prominence in 1968, with the advent of the american indian movement, a political force that raised awareness about native american issues through the use of marches and sit-ins and sometimes-violent confrontations with authorities. In its heyday the group occupied alcatraz prison and took over the bureau of indian affairs in washington, dc, for six days. Banks and his organization are perhaps most famous for their 1973 standoff with federal agents at the site of the 1890 wounded knee massacre, the new york times reports. On feb. 27, 1973, 200 aim followers and oglala lakota staged an armed occupation of the town of wounded knee, sd, and weathered a 10-week siege by us marshals and fbi agents. Two of the protestors were killed and one federal agent shot and paralyzed. Banks was charged with assault and conspiracy, but a federal judge dismissed the case, citing government misconduct.

I think i am going to be able to stand on that stage and draw a clear contrast with barack obama. \" on jobs: host chris wallace lit into perry for his pledge to create 2.5 million jobs, calling the plan \" terrible. We would roughly need 6 million jobs in the first four years just to stay even with population growth. Jimmy carter created 10.5 million jobs in his first four years. \" responded perry, any job at this particular point in time helps, \" adding that \" the idea that i ' m going to let people talk this plan down for the sake of just having an intellectual discussion is not correct. \" on cutting 18 % of federal spending: perry said he'd \" do away with earmarks \" toward this end, though politico notes bipartisan agreement exists on this point — and it's a small percentage of the overall budget. When pressed by wallace, perry said he could cut $ 25 billion from the education department and kick it back to states. \"there is one of the examples. \"",

Highlights: average speech length has skyrocketed to nearly two minutes. It used to be just 44 seconds for men, 39 seconds for women. And the speeches given with notes are longer ( 2 minutes, 2 seconds on average ) than those given without ( 1 minute, 23 seconds on average ). Just 3 % of directors cry while accepting their awards, while 21 % of actors do. The trend started recently, with 71 % of the tears happening since 1995. As for what to do with the statuette while you're busy talking, 26 % of men hoist it over their heads and 47 % of women clutch it with both hands. Just one person, jack palance, laid his on the podium while speaking. And as for who to thank, 61 % thank production reps; 48 % thank family; and 40 % thank the academy. The most-thanked person ( other than god ) is harvey weinstein, who has a dozen thank-yous to his name. Find out much, much more at rolfe's website.",

Jeff solomon, the president of the union that reps csu police, says the 20-year csumb police veteran feared for the student's safety and had de-escalated the scene so that such force wasn't warranted; the marina officers say he \" froze \" as they tried to restrain the \" non-compliant \" student, who wasn't currently armed, though a bloody knife was on the floor, reports the salinas californian. Marina police chief edmundo rodriguez claims his officers walked into a chaotic scene in february after the csumb officer called for backup. \" we saw blood everywhere, \" he says. ( solomon says the student's cuts were superficial and his officer had everything under control. ) rodriguez says the csumb officer left the room to \" take or make a phone call \"; solomon contends he left to get the distraught student some water and that when he came back, the others were struggling with the student and tasering him. When they requested the csumb officer help by firing his own stun gun, he refused, solomon says. The csumb officer complained to the marina sergeant about what had happened; the marina \" failure to act \" complaint was filed soon after that. \" we have an officer who showed incredible restraint in a very difficult situation, \" solomon says. \" [ he ] did everything right and he's not being supported. \"",

Among those on the list: the u.s. Army, the u.s. Air force and the miami police department. The rest of the list, which anonymous said was a small slice of its 200 gigabytes worth of plunder, included banks, law enforcement agencies, defense contractors and technology firms such as apple and microsoft. \" not so private and secret anymore? \" the group taunted in a message on the microblogging site. Lt. Col. John dorrian, public affairs officer for the air force, said that \" for obvious reasons \" the air force doesn't discuss specific vulnerabilities, threats or responses to them. \" the air force will continue to monitor the situation and, as always, take apporpriate action as necessary to protect air force networks and information, \" he said in an email. Miami police department spokesman sgt. Freddie cruz jr. Said that he could not confirm that the agency was a client of stratfor, and he said he had not received any information about any security breach involving the police department. Anonymous said it was able to get the credit details in part because stratfor didn't bother encrypting them _ an easy-to-avoid blunder which, if true, would be a major embarrassment for any security-related company. Hours after publishing what it claimed was stratfor's client list, anonymous posted images online that it suggested were receipts for charitable donations made by the group manipulating the credit card data it stole. \" thank you! defense intelligence agency, \" read the text above one image that appeared to show a transaction summary indicating that an agency employee's information was used to donate $ 250 to a non-profit. Stratfor said in an email to members that it had suspended its servers and email after learning that its website had been hacked. \" we have reason to believe that the names of our corporate subscribers have been posted on other web sites, \" said the email, passed on to the associated press by"

        "summary": "New white house press secretary sean spicer eased off his confrontational approach with reporters at his first official press briefing monday, following a weekend in which he berated reporters and then took all kinds of flak for his \" alternative facts. \" questioned about his honesty monday, he responded, \" our intention is never to lie to you, \" adding, \" i ' m going to come out here and tell you the facts as i know them, and if we make a mistake, i ' ll do our best to correct it, \" per the washington post. On that front, spicer acknowledged that he gave inaccurate figures saturday about metro ridership on inauguration day, saying they'd been passed along by an \" outside agency. \" but he continued to insist that the inauguration was watched by the most people in history, if you count tv, internet, and those there in person, reports politico. \"and i don't see any numbers that dispute that, \" he said. ( over the weekend, he asserted that trump had the largest attendance \" both in person and around the globe, \" with the \" in person \" part quickly rebutted by crowd estimate experts. ) spicer also pushed back against what he described as relentlessly negative coverage about president trump, going back to the campaign. \" it's demoralizing, \" he said in a plea for fairer coverage. Still, he opened the press conference with a joke seemingly to defuse the tension, saying that he'd told predecessor josh earnest that he won't be overtaking him as the most popular press secretary anytime soon. At the new york times, glenn thrush offers this takeaway after the 90-minute presser: \" on saturday, spicer's attitude signaled that it would be impossible for the press to cover the white house. Those fears were allayed somewhat today. \"",

Officials from the bahamas humane society, however, tell tribune 242 they're not sure how many pigs have actually died ( they think there are only around seven or eight left alive ), or if their deaths were intentional or inadvertent — only that their carcasses were dumped into the sea after they were found. The animals are a much-frequented attraction, even bringing in the likes of amy schumer and donald trump jr. Gray tells the guardian that from now on, visitors won't be able to feed the pigs ( they ' ll be roped off for pictures only ), while nixon notes he, his partner, and their families will continue to work with the government to \" regulate \" access to the pig colony.

        "summary": "If james k. Polk doesn't already hold the record for most burials of a former us president, there's little doubt he soon will. The tennessee senate voted 20-6 monday to allow the remains of the 11th president to be exhumed and reburied — for the third time, the ap reports. Unsurprisingly, the repeated digging up of a president hasn't been without controversy. According to the washington post, polk died of cholera in 1849 and was quickly buried in a mass grave in nashville city cemetery. Laws at the time required people who died of infectious diseases to be buried within 24 hours. A year later, his body was reburied at his home in nashville as specified in his will, the tennessean reports. Polk's remains were moved again in 1891 after a family fight resulted in his home being sold and eventually becoming a hotel. The idea to move polk's remains a third time — from the grounds of the state capitol to his family's home in columbia — comes from tom price, the curator of the james k. Polk home and museum. He says the move will help better preserve polk's legacy and improve awareness of the former president — and maybe even increase visits to the museum, which lag far behind those to andrew jackson's nearby home. But some of polk's descendants are against the move, calling it \" degrading \" and akin to \" grave robbery. \" the resolution to exhume and relocate polk's remains still needs to be approved by a court, the state's house of representatives, and the tennessee historical society.",

        "summary": "Vladimir putin today presided over military exercises that simulated what the ap calls a \" massive retaliatory nuclear strike in response to an enemy attack, \" further stoking tensions simmering in ukraine. Putin said the drills had been planned since november, and the move comes a day after he said he had pulled russian troops back from the ukraine border — though us and nato intel indicates nothing to confirm that actually happened ( more on that below ). And though the bbc reports that putin yesterday struck a seemingly softer tone, calling on pro-russia separatists to delay a referendum on autonomy set for sunday, that request fell on deaf ears. Separatist leaders in donetsk announced today that they're going ahead with the referendum anyway. \" they feel that this is the people's choice — that they respect mr. Putin, but this path of a referendum will lead to the peace that mr. Putin wants, \" reports npr's correspondent in the city. Elsewhere: confusion and disbelief continues among rebels over putin's call for a delay, the guardian finds. One militia member in slovyansk described putin as a coward. \" instead of helping russian people here, he is betraying us, \" he says. \" he will pay for this with a revolution in red square. Russian people will not stand by and watch this happen. \" nato, the pentagon, and the white house say they've seen no sign of putin pulling back troops, reports reuters. \" we would certainly welcome a meaningful and transparent withdrawal, \" a white house spokesman says. \" to date, there has been no evidence that such a withdrawal has taken place. \" western governments are still pretty skeptical about putin's intentions, especially considering what happened in crimea, the new york times reports. Analysts suspect putin wants to avoid chaos — and an expensive, bloody invasion — while still keeping eastern ukraine in moscow's orbit. \" he really promised nothing, \" a political commentator in moscow says. \" he demonstrated that he controls the level of tension in ukraine. He can return the situation to the high levels of violence at any moment. He did not refuse the referendum, but only proposed delaying it. \"",

So how did kotsenburg win? with a trick he had never tried before, of course, not even in practice. Usa today describes it as \" four and a half backwards spins ( 1620 degrees of rotation ), while grabbing the backside of his board. \" prior to the race, kotsenburg said pressure wasn't his thing. \"i really want to medal just as much as the next guy, but my attitude in the run, if i land, that's cool, \" he said.

        "summary": "A prison guard has now been charged in connection with the great escape from a new york prison. The accused is gene palmer, whose name surfaced tuesday in reports that he delivered hacksaw blades hidden inside frozen hamburger meat to escapee richard matt. Palmer, 57, who has been on paid leave since the escape, is charged with promoting dangerous prison contraband, destroying evidence, and misconduct, reports cnn. His lawyer continues to insist that palmer knew nothing of the escape plans or those blades. Authorities say that prison tailor shop worker joyce mitchell hid the blades and drill bits in the meat, froze it, and asked palmer to deliver the hamburger to matt, reports abc news. More: \" before he handed off the meat, he asked if there was anything wrong with it and she said no, \" says attorney andrew brockway. Because of that assurance, palmer didn't put it through a metal detector, says brockway. No matter what, though, the latter lapse is a violation of prison rules, says clinton county da andrew wylie. So why would incarcerated inmates want frozen hamburger anyway? they had a hot plate for cooking. A source tells cnn that palmer allegedly provided a screwdriver and needle-nose pliers that david sweat used to repair electrical breakers in a catwalk behind his cell. The men apparently used the catwalk as part of their escape route. Cnn further cites a document that states matt, who painted celebrity portraits, gave paintings to palmer, which he tried to get rid of by burning and burying them after the men escaped. Abc news has this from a statement palmer made to investigators: \" matt provided me with elaborate paintings and information on the illegal acts that inmates were committing within the facility. In turn, i provided him with benefits such as paint, paintbrushes, movement of inmates, hamburger meat, altering of electrical boxes in the catwalk areas. \"",

        "summary": "Last year in england, the number of gay men diagnosed with hiv was slashed by a third from the previous year. The drop was even more drastic in london, with a 40 % decrease, and, as patrick strudwick reveals for buzzfeed, that major shift was driven by a homeless ex-sex worker named greg owen. Strudwick points out that owen's astonishing work behind the scenes is reminiscent of ron woodroof, the drug-smuggling hiv patient portrayed in dallas buyers club — except where woodroof's real-life narrative was an \" outrageous story that ended in tragedy … owen's is a tragic story that ends in outrageous success, \" with thousands spared from the illness because of his efforts. Those efforts revolve around a drug called truvada, taken as part of a preventive regimen called pre-exposure prophylaxis in which non-infected users take a pill every day to keep the virus at bay. A truvada rx cost around $ 600 a month in august 2015, when owen posted on facebook that he wanted to do the prep regimen. A pal gave him some extra pills — but then he discovered he was hiv-positive. He updated his previous post in what strudwick calls the \" single act... That would change everything. \" people started bombarding him with questions about prep and he set up an informational website to stop \" these f --- ing bastards asking me about [ it ]. \" i want prep now, which launched in october 2015, eventually evolved to also help users buy cheaper, effective generic versions of truvada from overseas. Owen's underground movement became a monster one, and he ended up quitting his two jobs to lobby the uk's nhs to commission the drug — a push that became reality in december. His incredible story at buzzfeed. ( a new tool in the fight against hiv? )",

One of the world's most esteemed hiv doctors, professor sheena mccormack – whose life's work as an epidemiologist has been to track and fight the virus – picked up the phone to deliver a message that would make headline news: in the space of 12 months, the number of gay men in london being diagnosed with hiv had dropped by 40 %. Across england it was down by a third. No british doctor has been able to report a fall this steep in more than 35 years of the virus.

The verdict: the court upheld the federal tax subsidies for the affordable care act, voting 6-3 to preserve health insurance for 8.7 million americans and solidifying president obama's signature domestic achievement, the ap reports. Chief justice john roberts and justice anthony kennedy — who dissented in the 2012 decision upholding the law — sided with their liberal colleagues in the vote. Writing for the majority, roberts stated, \" congress passed the affordable care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. \" further, \" tax credits are available to individuals in states that have a federal exchange, \" per the los angeles times. If the credits were disallowed, he continued, it \" could well push a state's individual market into a death spiral. \" meanwhile, justice antonin scalia calls the majority's decision \" pure applesauce \" and accuses his colleagues of \" interpretive jiggery-pokery \" in a 21-page dissent that nearly reaches walt frazier levels with its colorful language, talking points memo reports. \" you would think the answer would be obvious — so obvious there would hardly be a need for the supreme court to hear a case about it, \" he writes, per mother jones, adding in a comment that's getting lots of twitter reaction as one of the snarkiest comments made about the case yet: \" [ the decision ] rewrites the law to make tax credits available everywhere.

He was shot dead early sunday after firing more than 100 rounds at police responding to a domestic disturbance call at the highlands ranch apartment complex in suburban denver.

At 8: 45, the crowd waiting to watch sugarland perform was warned that the severe weather could arrive and was given instructions on where to find shelter if need be. But the warning itself wasn't severe, says one concertgoer: \" they didn't say anything like a tornado is coming or that we had to leave right away. \" at that same moment, however, a fair official and police commander were making plans to evacuate the grandstand and were planning a follow-up announcement — but it was too late. Four minutes later, at 8: 49pm, a 60mph to 70mph wind gust brought the stage down.

Where's the due process? \" the distinction between ( a ) government accusations and ( b ) proof of guilt is central to every free society, by definition, yet this memo — and those who defend obama's assassination power — willfully ignore it. \" the memo has at its core the \" bush/cheney worldview, \" writes greenwald in his lengthy critique. \" if you believe the president has the power to order us citizens executed far from any battlefield with no charges or trial, then it's truly hard to conceive of any asserted power you would find objectionable. \" read greenwald's full column here.

Since then, senior obama officials including attorney general eric holder and john brennan, obama's top terrorism adviser and his current nominee to lead the cia, have explicitly argued that the president is and should be vested with this power.

When the existence of obama's hit list was first reported several months earlier by the washington post's dana priest, she wrote that the \" list includes three americans \". What has made these actions all the more radical is the absolute secrecy with which obama has draped all of this.

During the same period, median net worth for households headed by an adult younger than 35 shrank 68 percent, to $ 3,662. Seniors built this advantage partly because they had more time to amass equity in their homes. Even the real estate downturn that began in the middle of the last decade has not wiped out the older generation's wealth advantage. In june, when noting changes in americans ' net worth between 2005 and 2010, the census bureau reported that the median elderly-headed households lost 13 percent of their net worth — easily the smallest decrease of any age group.

Now, however, a new study suggests that the guessing game could someday end, and it's all thanks to llamas, reports science. Researchers say their work is a genuine step toward the creation of a universal vaccine, one that would be delivered through a nasal spray and prove far more effective in protecting humans from the ever-changing virus — and potentially from a pandemic, reports the los angeles times. The technique, which the new york times calls \" a sophisticated combination of immunotherapy and gene therapy, \" worked extremely well in mice. The next step is to move on to other animals and ultimately to clinical trials for humans. So why llamas? they have unusually small antibodies that can nimbly fight invading viruses. The researchers vaccinated the llamas against several flu strains, causing their immune systems to produce antibodies that were then harvested. As the lat explains, four of those antibodies were \" uniquely \" tiny and seemed potent against a variety of flu strains. Those four were used to create what the nyt calls a single \" mega-antibody. \" another novel step followed: they injected into it the mice via a harmless virus used in gene therapy, a way of side-stepping the immune system, which the nyt reports would be unable to produce \" this artificial creation. \" when sprayed into the noses of mice, the new defense worked — the virus penetrated cells in the nasal cavity, and they started to pump out the mega-antibody.

Although the strategy must go through more testing before human trials can begin, researchers who have struggled to develop a \" universal \" vaccine against the highly mutable flu virus say it merits serious attention. The nasal spray could prove a boon to the elderly, who typically suffer most from flu and get only weak protection from existing vaccines.

For one thing, its effectiveness fluctuates from year to year. At best, the vaccine may reduce the risk of illness by about 60 percent. Last year, during one of the worst flu epidemics in recent memory, that figure was just 40 percent. And if a new strain of the flu were to strike, it might take months to develop an effective vaccine — plenty of time for the virus to sweep the globe, claiming hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives.",
            "If the dominant strain in a given season were to suddenly change, these antibodies would be ready for the unwelcome guest. If a flu strain came out of nowhere and threatened a population with no immunity to it — the nightmare scenario of pandemic flu — this supercharged defender would recognize that flu and counter it. If health officials guessed wrong about what flu strain was coming and ordered up a vaccine that would be largely ineffective — a scenario that played out last flu season — this package of antibodies could save the day."

The boy was arrested on a murder charge saturday at the valley springs substation of the calaveras county sheriff's department, two weeks after investigators began the manhunt for the killer of 8-year-old leila fowler. No information was available sunday on where the boy was being held. Sheriff's officials did not release the boy's name and said no new details of the investigation would be released at this time. The attack drew national attention because of the boy's statement to investigators that a man had entered the family home in valley springs and killed leila.

Burton lee iii tells politico. And it's not so farfetched to think trump could suffer health issues; if elected, he'd be 70 when he takes office, making him the oldest incoming president ever ( ronald reagan was 69 ). Exhibit a, per politico. \" i love steak and hamburger and pasta and french fries, all of the things that we shouldn't be eating, \" he said in a recent clip from bloomberg's all due respect, admitting a particular penchant for bacon and eggs. And while he cops to playing a little golf and tennis, he told the new york times magazine in september that giving speeches are his form of exercise and that \" all my friends who work out all the time, they're going for knee replacements, hip replacements — they're a disaster. \" hillary clinton, 68, has released her records, politico notes, as have chris christie, 53, and jeb bush, 62.

The star-advertiser indicates that the group knew that might be the outcome: in a release sent to the media yesterday, they urged supporters to call the honolulu pd and \" ask for our release and request vegan meals for those who need them \" in the event of arrests. The ap notes that the group said that in addition to backing the national movement, it stood \" in solidarity \" with the homeless, who it says are being removed from parks as the city preps to host apec meetings this week. And on the other coast, another park-fueled clash: the atlanta journal-constitution reports that about 150 people vowed to stay in woodruff park after closing time. But the group did start to leave the park after 11pm — one protester says they decided to save the city money by staving off arrests — but chaos broke out after an incident involving a policeman on a motorcycle.

Luckily, the security guard who stopped corkins managed to wrestle away his 9mm handgun even after getting shot. Corkins pleaded guilty to interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition, assault with intent to kill while armed, and committing an act of terrorism while armed.",

While carey hart was racing, pink held up a sign saying, \" will you marry me? \" he kept racing, so she flipped the sign over to the side that said, \" i ' m serious. \" at that point, he dropped out of the race and accepted. At the unveiling of his own statue, garth brooks took a knee — onstage, in front of 7,000 people — and asked trisha yearwood to marry him. Alec baldwin took hilaria thomas, who is spanish, to a lighthouse near his new york home. \" this is the closest i could get you to spain, \" he said. Dean mcdermott took tori spelling on a horse-drawn carriage ride through a christmas tree farm, which his sister had decorated with christmas lights. At the end of the tour, he proposed.

        "summary": "People who suffer from depression but are happily in love — perhaps an odd combination — may want to think twice about popping certain antidepressants, livescience reports. In a new study, researchers gave two kinds of antidepressants to 192 people who were depressed but in healthy relationships for at least seven months. \" indeed, our subjects were those who could be properly considered smitten by love, \" says study author hagop akiskal. The participants — 69 men and 123 women, with a mean age of 41 — filled out questionnaires saying how their feelings of attraction, attachment, and love toward their partner changed after taking the drugs. What they found: participants taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ) were more likely to be uncomfortable with \" sharing their partners'thoughts and feelings, \" reports livescience, and less hopeful that their love would endure, than those taking taking the other kind — tricyclic antidepressants. Men taking ssris were less inclined to ask for advice or help from their partners than women taking ssris. Women taking tricyclic antidepressants saw more negative effects on their sex lives than men taking the same drug. \" the good news is that there are a variety of agents for treating depression, \" says akiskal. Meanwhile, antidepressant consumption has been rising worldwide for the past decade, reports the seattle post-intelligencer in an article that looks at who is using the drugs and why. Teenagers in the us, however, are taking fewer antidepressants — perhaps too few — since an fda warning about possible suicide risks in 2004, the minneapolis star tribune reports.

The sample was composed by 192 outpatients ( 123 women and 69 men, mean age ± sd: 41.2 ± 10.2 years ), suffering from mild or moderate depression, according to dsm-iv-tr criteria, that were selected if they were treated with one antidepressant only for at least six months and were involved in a loving relationship.

            "The trend following the 2004 black-box warning about antidepressants and suicide risk was predictable — many adolescents simply stopped taking these drugs. After all, what parent wants to give potent psychiatric meds to kids if it makes them more likely to think about and even attempt suicide? trouble is, the public response to the warning from the u.s. Food and drug administration might have gone too far, leaving depressed teens with less treatment. Now a university of minnesota researcher is among the first to document the effect — not just on symptoms, but on how depressed teens did in school following the warning and whether they were prone to drug use and delinquency. \"those are all things that have lifelong consequences, \" said ezra golberstein, a u assistant professor of public health. In the three years following the fda warning, antidepressant use in adolescents dropped 20 to 30 percent, research has shown.",
            "In 1994, when elizabeth wurtzel wrote \"prozac nation, \" an autobiographical account of her struggles with severe depression, which was later adapted into a feature film under the same title, her story was considered an extreme case of a troubled life. What she described then, however, was already a widespread phenomenon that has now morphed into a national malaise and beyond. Antidepressants and painkillers rank among the most commonly prescribed drugs in the united states today. In 2011, the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) national center for health statistics published a report that identified about 11 percent of the american public as antidepressant users, a 400 percent increase since the 1980s when previous surveys were taken. Worldwide, consumption of antidepressants has been dramatically on the rise over the past decade, and there are no signs of abating. On the contrary, the pharmaceutical industry predicts ever-increasing demands",

        "summary": "Two severed heads in two separate states, but found with striking similarities, have investigators in texas and louisiana trying to see if there's a possible link. Khou reported earlier this month on the first grim find near lake houston on march 24, when volunteers cleaning up litter discovered a woman's head in a black garbage bag. The houston chronicle notes that a few weeks before that, a prison inmate also on cleanup duty stumbled across a severed female head in a plastic grocery bag, left along a highway near calcasieu lake in cameron parish. Those remains were believed to have been outside for about three months, per katc. But although the two discoveries were made 150 miles apart, the parallels between the two have been notable enough for authorities to wonder if there's a connection. In addition to being discarded in a plastic bag near a lake, the description of the head found in louisiana \" sounds real similar \" to that of the one in texas, houston police department homicide investigator michael perez told the chronicle earlier this month, though he said at the time he needed more details. Both women were believed to be white or hispanic and had reddish hair, as well as \" good teeth. \" the condition of the teeth is important, perez notes, as it could weed out drug abusers. Police probing the lake houston case are seeking a man thought to be in his 20s who was seen hurling a garbage bag off a nearby bridge a couple of weeks before the head was found. Perez and his counterpart in cameron parish are sharing information as they continue to each work on their cases in the hopes of seeing if there are any more ties.

In an extensive piece, the new york times traces spears ' journey over the past eight years, noting that today, the 34-year-old has a wildly successful las vegas residency and a new album coming out this year, and is now the kind of person who says things like \" i ' m in a real good place in my life \" in interviews. So, is she ready for the conservatorship to be lifted? spears hasn't said much of anything publicly about the conservatorship since it was first put in place, at which point she compared it to something even worse than a jail sentence. But there are signs it could be time for it to come to an end. For one thing, her conservators ( her father and a lawyer ) used to work hard to protect her from having to testify in lawsuits against her, but on monday, they allowed her to testify against sam lutfi, who says she owes him money after agreeing to let him act as her manager in 2007. The times notes that the experience went \" without incident. \" but the newspaper also looks at all the money that changes hands as part of the conservatorship — her estate has paid $ 6.9 million to the conservators and other lawyers helping to manage her affairs; her court-appointed lawyer has been awarded more than $ 2 million in fees since 2008 for his work with her; her dad takes in more than $ 130,000 per year. \" as long as she is bringing in so much money and as long as the lawyers and conservators are getting paid, there is little incentive to end it, \" notes one expert.

            "Neither the conservators nor her managers or lawyers will discuss her status, and ms. Spears did not respond to multiple requests seeking an interview. While it is not possible to get an accurate sense of someone's mental state from afar, ms. Spears's friends and former associates said in interviews that, for her, the conservatorship has become an accepted fact of life — not a cage but a protective bubble that allows her to worry about her true passions: music and her children. \"if anyone knew the real britney, they would know that she would rather be remembered for being the great mother she is rather than the artist she is, \" said david lucado, a former boyfriend whose relationship with ms.

            "Neither the conservators nor her managers or lawyers will discuss her status, and ms. Spears did not respond to multiple requests seeking an interview. While it is not possible to get an accurate sense of someone's mental state from afar, ms. Spears's friends and former associates said in interviews that, for her, the conservatorship has become an accepted fact of life — not a cage but a protective bubble that allows her to worry about her true passions: music and her children. \"if anyone knew the real britney, they would know that she would rather be remembered for being the great mother she is rather than the artist she is, \" said david lucado, a former boyfriend whose relationship with ms. Spears foundered in 2014 amid charges of infidelity that mr. Lucado denies. \"and if anyone could see her interactions with her kids, they would know that there is no need for a conservatorship over britney's personal life. \" since the conservatorship began, some restrictions have been eased.

Last month, the who suggested that within nine months, the world could see 20,000 cases; now it points to that many cases as soon as early november, barring drastic action against the virus, the new york times reports. The death rate, the report says, is about 70 %; earlier assessments had put it at 50 %, nbc news reports. Instead of a temporary outbreak, the who suggests, west africa could see an endemic one — one that could see the region become a \" reservoir \" of the virus, as the times puts it. The new report, the work of more than 50 scientists, was published alongside an editorial by two experts that warns of \" a very real danger of a complete breakdown in civic society \" in a region whose health system is already beyond capacity. That editorial slams a \" highly inadequate and late global response \" to an \" avoidable crisis. \" the authors, one of whom helped discover ebola, say a \" massive increase \" in that response is needed, \" way beyond what is being planned. \" there have been some 2,803 reported deaths from the outbreak so far, but numbers could be far higher, as graves in sierra leone's capital suggest: while the health ministry has reported 10 deaths in freetown, a local cemetery has seen 110 victims buried in the past eight days, its supervisor tells the times.",
