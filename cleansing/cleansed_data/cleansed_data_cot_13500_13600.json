        "summary": "Another train accident is making headlines: a cargo train derailed near an industrial park just outside baltimore about 2pm, setting off a thunderous explosion, reports the baltimore sun. The train reportedly hit a truck, and the vehicle's driver was in serious condition. So far, no other injuries have been reported. No word on what the train might have been carrying, but a county spokesperson says the smoke wasn't toxic. Authorities evacuated a 20-block area as a precaution. The ap says industrial buildings near the explosion collapsed, though it was unclear whether they were occupied. Hazardous waste teams were on the site. \"it was enough to scare the leaving bejesus out of you, \" says one employee of a seafood shop near the blast.",

        "summary": "Non-runners may look at a runner off in the distance and feel a twinge of envy, because surely that person is in some kind of zen-like zone, ruminating about life's mysteries. A first-of-its kind study that had runners record their thoughts on the go clears that up: some samples of the deep thoughts, as cited in a writeup at the british psychology society: \" my hips are a little tight. I ' m stiff, my feet, my ankles, just killing me this morning. \" and: \" hill, you're a bitch... It's long and hot — god damn it... Mother eff-er. \" and: \" that sucked but it's going to be an awesome run on the way back. \" it turns out that the 10 amateur long-distance runners in the study spent 32 % of their time thinking about the \" pain and discomfort \" they were in, say researchers. ( the runs were at least 7 miles. ) in fairness, they spent 40 % of their time thinking about pace and distance ( \" downhill, don't kill yourself, just cruise \" ) and the rest of the time thinking about their running environment ( \" it's so beautiful, the ocean, the mountains \" and \" hope i don't see any snakes \" ). A post at new york finds the study interesting but notes that the runners'very act of recording their thoughts may have kept them from \" drifting off into daydream land. \" still, the researchers think this study and future similar ones will be interesting to sports psychologists. For one thing, runners tended to complain about discomfort near the start of the run, but those complaints tapered off as the miles went by. ( another study finds that running too much can be as bad as sitting around. )",

You're out there for hours, with only the voices in your head — whether your own or those pumped in through your earbuds — for company. What do runners think about during all those solitary hours on the road? writing for bps research digest, psychologist and science of us pal christian jarrett explains that researchers have tried to study this question before, by asking runners to jot down summaries of their thoughts after they completed their runs. The problem with this, of course, is that by the time the runners sat down to do this, they'd mostly forgotten their thoughts already. So now new research published recently in the international journal of sport and exercise psychology tries a different tactic: the researchers gave the runners recording equipment and asked them to \"think aloud \" their thoughts as they ran. In the end, this gave the researchers more than 18 hours of audio from the ten runners in their study, who ranged in age from 29 to 52. Each of them was training for a long-distance race, either a half-marathon or longer, and they recorded their thoughts on a run that was at least seven miles long. Mostly, their thoughts focused on the here and now, things like their pace or their surroundings. But they also spent a lot of time thinking about how much everything hurt: \"my hips are a little tight.

This might have been influenced by the study setup itself, specifically the use of the recording device.

There are also plenty of long-gone sights, too — we spotted the singer building, demolished in 1968, as well as the very unusual sight of elevated trains riding over the brooklyn bridge. Alas, it's not embeddable, but head on over to moma's website to check out the film in all its glory."

Taylor swift is threatening to sue a celebrity website for posting a topless photo of a skinny blond in blue undies who may or may not be her, huffington post reports. The site, celeb jihad, says it's probably her, considering the pic's wood paneling ( which suggests a \" double-wide trailer \" ) and the strawberry images on her underwear ( \" taylor swift has been known to eat strawberries \" ). Hardly amused, swift's lawyers fired off a letter this weekend accusing celeb jihad of posting \" false pornographic images and false ' news, ' \" tmz reports. Like scarlett johannson, swift hardly takes such things lying down: she once wrote a song and made a video over a single bad review, entertainment weekly reminds us. As for celeb jihad, it posted today that \" we will remove the article if taylor swift simply agrees to convert to islam.... Allahu akbar! \" ( check out who the fbi arrested for allegedly hacking johansson's nude pic. )",

The council in muzaffarabad, a village outside multan, allegedly ordered the victim's teenage brother to rape the assailant's 16-year-old sister as \" punishment, \" per a police official. In the bbc's telling, the rape was carried out in front of both the council and the girls parent's, with the mothers of both the violated girls then going to police, reportedly to file rape charges against the other's son. Reuters backs up the report, and quotes multan police officer ahsan younis as saying, \" a total of 29 people were involved in this ghastly crime, and we have 25 of them in our custody. \" the rapes reportedly took place on july 16 and july 18, per dawn, and the washington post describes the family relationship, reporting the father of one of the young men is the brother of the second's grandfather. It's the family connection that's somewhat atypical, reports the post, which says this was a \" very distinct type of a panchayat \" ( village council ) in that it was composed entirely of men related to one another, rather than elders from various families. It's not the only twist the post sees: while \" honor \" crimes continue to occur in pakistan, \" what made this case different was that somebody spoke up, and authorities took action. \" younis says the young men could face death, but it's the court's call.

Surrounded by steep mountains and barren plains, the dam has also been home to a small combat outpost of marines and afghan soldiers over the years. They would be excused for thinking they had been deposited at the end of the earth. The united states first began construction on the kajaki dam in the early 1950s. Construction on the project was halted after the soviet invasion in 1979. It resumed after the u.s.-led invasion to oust the taliban and rebuild afghanistan. The original planners had a grand vision for the hydrorelectric dam and power plant. It would turn the helmand valley green with crops and bring electricity and economic growth to kandahar. But today, kajaki stands at the center of a debate that goes to the heart of america's role in afghanistan.

            "Report calls kajaki dam either hubris or commitment a marine patrols near the kajaki river. ( photo: david goldman, ap ) there are few locations more desolate – or with more breathtaking scenery. Nestled high in the mountains, the kajaki dam spills emerald green waters from a reservoir into the raging helmand river below. Surrounded by steep mountains and barren plains, the dam has also been home to a small combat outpost of marines and afghan soldiers over the years. They would be excused for thinking they had been deposited at the end of the earth. The united states first began construction on the kajaki dam in the early 1950s. Construction on the project was halted after the soviet invasion in 1979. It resumed after the u.s.-led invasion to oust the taliban and rebuild afghanistan. The original planners had a grand vision for the hydrorelectric dam and power plant. It would turn the helmand valley green with crops and bring electricity and economic growth to kandahar. But today, kajaki stands at the center of a debate that goes to the heart of america's role in afghanistan. The project is seen either as a symbol of american hubris gone awry or america's steadfast commitment to rebuild afghanistan. That debate will likely surface again with the release of a report tuesday. \" unfortunately, after using multiple contractors and sub­contractors,",

        "summary": "Apple is whipping out its proverbial credit card in a huge way. The firm intends to sell $ 17 billion in bonds, in what would be the biggest sale of investment-grade corporate debt in us history, sources tell the wall street journal. Apple wouldn't comment on the sale or confirm specifics, but it did say that it intends to issue debt in order to return $ 100 billion to shareholders by the end of 2015. Expect demand for the bonds to be massive — indeed, henry blodget at business insider writes today that the news has managed to affect the multi-trillion-dollar market for us government debt. Some pundits are even saying that the bonds are as safe as their government counterparts, though blodget thinks such people are \" hallucinating. \" joke about the debt if you want, but uncle sam \" has something that even apple will never have: a money printing press. \"",

Police say the choice meant that it took longer for emergency personnel to reach konwiser, who died after being airlifted to a hospital in critical condition. But zoo spokeswoman naki carter tells nbc news that the ammunition required to kill a tiger \" comes with a series of checks and balances \" and \" based on what we know at this time, \" using a tranquilizer, which can take as long as 10 minutes to take effect, was the right decision. Experts say that while few details on the death have been released, konwiser was in a tiger sleeping enclosure, and the danger of ricochets hurting either the shooter or konwiser may have played a role in the decision. The county medical examiner says the 37-year-old died from a neck injury, though he didn't say whether she was bitten or clawed, cbs news reports. The zoo miami communications director tells nbc that the policy at that zoo would be to shoot the animal in order to rescue the human as quickly as possible — but it would be pointless to euthanize the tiger, one of just 250 of the malayan subspecies left on the planet, now. \" the tiger was being a tiger, \" he says. The palm beach post reports that the zoo issued a statement thursday saying it won't give more details on the death until state and federal investigators conclude their work. \" rumors circulating from disgruntled staff members \" are \" completely inaccurate, \" the statement said.

        "summary": "A multinational team of researchers set out to settle what has oddly been a longstanding dispute in scientific circles: whether, in moby dick-esque fashion, sperm whales could use their heads to bash seagoing vessels. And it seems that herman melville got it right. Writing in the journal peerj, researchers concluded that a part of a sperm whale's head \" evolved to function as a massive battering ram during male-male competition. \" the idea has been \" highly controversial \" because skeptics say such collisions would damage sensitive organs inside the whale's head, but in a press release, the researchers say connective tissue \" may function as a shock absorber. \" the researchers, who hail from australia, the us, england, and japan, didn't determine whether the whales actually butt heads or ram boats, the washington post notes, only that they could — and live to fight another day. Four incidents occurred between 1820 and 1902 in which sperm whales reportedly rammed whaling ships, according to tech times, and one of them inspired melville to write moby dick. The sperm whale's forehead — \" one of the strangest structures in the animal kingdom, \" per the study's lead author — is home to what is called the spermaceti organ ( which is filled with oil ) and something called the junk sac. It has been established that the junk sac helps with echolocation. This new research, based on simulated whale crash tests, concludes that it can also be used as a weapon. The idea is further supported by the fact that the exterior of the junk is often scarred, per the study. \" so there you have it, aspiring whalers, \" the post writes. \" the moby dicks out there are well-prepared to take you on. \" ( an ancient white whale was discovered in the depths of the smithsonian. )",

( the times shares gore's theory: that hannah was kept in an area of dimaggio's property where she wouldn't have observed their murders. ) other details from the press conference: james dimaggio fired at fbi agents — at least once, possibly twice — using his rifle before they killed him. Gore says that hannah made it \" very clear \" in interviews with police that she is \" a victim in every sense of the word. \" gore also said, without elaboration, that the crime was \" not spur of the moment. \" as for what her captivity was like, gore told the times that she was \" under extreme duress \" and that \" extensive threats \" and a weapon were involved. Questions that remain unanswered, per the ap: how hannah's mother and brother died and whether hannah tried to escape. Very bizarre details, from a family friend: dimaggio's father, james everet dimaggio, was arrested after breaking into the home of his ex-girlfriend in 1988, wearing a ski mask and carrying a sawed-off shotgun and handcuffs; she wasn't home, but he held her 16-year-old daughter until she escaped after asking to use the bathroom. Dimaggio's house burned down exactly 15 years after his father disappeared, and saturday's shootout came exactly 15 years after his father committed suicide in 1998 after consuming a large amount of meth intravenously and walking into the desert.",

Which is why a new study published in jama internal medicine may not bring relief to those hoping for a quick demise to the excessively warm, sweaty stage: a 17-year review of 1,449 women from a variety of ethnic, racial, and geographic groups ( said to be the largest such study to date ) found that hot flashes can last up to 14 years for some women — and that the earlier they start, the longer they may last, the new york times reports. \" if you don't have hot flashes until you've stopped menses, then you won't have them as long, \" study co-author dr. Nancy avis tells the times. African-american women had the longest-lasting hot-flash symptoms with a median of 10.1 years, which was nearly double that of asian women; the median number of years for hispanic women was 8.9, while for non-hispanic whites it was 6.5. What causes those differences could be anything from genes and diet to how many kids a woman has had, avis tells the times. Those who have the flashes for longer also tend not to be as well educated, to have more perceived stress, and to experience more depression and anxiety ( though it's not clear if such stress and emotional problems may help expedite hot flashes or if the hot flashes help bring those on ). There are ways to alleviate symptoms, usa today points out: a woman in perimenopause ( before menstruation fully stops ) could take low-dose versions of birth control pills or even certain antidepressants. Additional suggestions from the national institute on aging: not smoking, sipping cool drinks when a flash is coming on, and dressing in layers.

Livescience notes that the culture ministry chief has called the possibility highly unlikely, though he later clarified that because nobody knows where alexander is buried, he wasn't definitively ruling it out. Pending tests on the bones should at least determine the age and gender of the deceased.

        "summary": "Researchers claim to have discovered evidence of life on earth more than 200 million years before the oldest known fossils, the bbc reports. A layer of permanent snow melted away last spring on greenland's isua supracrustal belt, revealing a series of wavy peaks called stromatolites in the 3.7 billion-year-old rock. Researchers say those peaks were created by bacterial colonies. Previously, the oldest evidence of life was 3.48 billion-year-old stromatolites in australia. Researchers published their findings in nature. \"this helps us think about how life developed on earth, how fast that process was, \" professor martin van kranendonk says. \" it pushes everything back a little further, narrows the window between when we know nothing, and when we begin to know something. \" their discovery could also help us know something about life on other planets, science reports. It could guide other scientists on where and how to look for signs of ancient life on mars and elsewhere. But the scientific community at large is far from convinced by the greenland stromatolites. According to the guardian, rocks as old as those in greenland have typically been exposed to extreme heat and pressure, destroying any possible evidence of life, leading some experts to argue the waves and peaks seen by researchers are the result of physical forces, not organic ones. The discovery is nothing more than \" highly deformed rocks, \" one expert tells the bbc. ( meet \" earth's first animal. \" )",

At 87, she's the same age as the youngest of three models standing in the cover photo, where their bare feet and shoulders peek out from behind a banner they hold advertising the barberton facility and the affiliated pleasant view health care center. It reads: \" pleasant view, pleasant pointe. \" another resident in the calendar is covered only by a large exercise ball. Administrator teresa morris told the akron beacon journal ( http://bit.ly/1x0k3x3 ) that the residents were clearly having fun the morning the photos were taken. \" the residents were like 20-year-olds — giggling, and having the time of their lives, \" morris said. \" i do not believe the elderly should just sit around staring at each other. I want a fun environment where i challenge them and they challenge me. \" money from the $ 12 calendars goes toward a fund providing shoes for children in the local schools in the city of barberton. ___ information from: akron beacon journal, http://www.ohio.com",

        "summary": "Howling wolves may sound alike to us humans, but each howl is distinct — and researchers have for the first time developed a system to tell them apart and identify individuals, reports nature world news. British scientists at nottingham trent university developed software that measures pitch and volume so precisely that it correctly identified wolves 100 % of the time in 67 solo howls. Even in group howls, it detected individuals with 97 % accuracy. \" in scientific terms this is really exciting, because it means that if we hear a howl on night one we can tell if it is or isn't the same wolf that you hear on subsequent nights, \" says one of the researchers. That could be a huge help in keeping track of wolf packs because the audio analysis will be cheaper and easier than, say, putting gps collars on the animals, notes the conversation blog. Another intriguing detail: the researchers detected a \" regional accent \" from the howls of wolves in a specific area, reports wired.

Get it over with, \" yelled david fry, 27. \" we're innocent people camping at a public facility, and you're going to murder us. \" nevada state lawmaker michele fiore, a prominent supporter of the occupation, called in to calm the situation down, telling the group that she needed them alive. Along with fry, jeff banta, 46, and married couple sean anderson, 48, and sandy anderson, 47 ( some sources have the husband and wife's ages switched ) are the last remnants of the 40-day occupation of the malheur national wildlife refuge. They had originally insisted that they would only leave if all charges were dropped and they were allowed to keep their guns, but they eventually agreed to surrender at 8am pst thursday, with fiore and the rev. Franklin graham present, reports the guardian, which notes that the fbi has not confirmed the arrangement. \" we are not surrendering, we're turning ourselves in, \" said sean anderson. \" it goes against everything we believe in, but we're going to do it. \" fiore and nevada rancher cliven bundy, father of two jailed occupation leaders, are believed to be on their way to the scene.",

The camp only opened in july 2012, but now houses some 120,000 syrians and is the fourth-largest population center in jordan. \" in za ' atari, the dispossession is absolute, \" writes remnick. \" everyone has lost his country, his home, his equilibrium. \" nevertheless, in a little over a year, the camp has grown into a city of sorts. There are \" shawarma and chicken and pizza joints, \" and \" appliance stores where you can get a fan, a flat-screen tv, an air-conditioner, \" but also brothels, a thriving black market, and various mafias calling the shots. About 2,000 babies have been born in the camp, with 70 more coming every week. There are schools, but only a sixth of the 65,000 kids and teens attend. Many leave because they have to work — often for the mafias. \" one eight-year-old child, i asked why he left school, \" says an aid worker. \" he said his last memory of school was when gunmen came in the classroom and shot the teachers. \" meanwhile, the guardian also visited za ' atari yesterday during obama's announcement.

After a few miles, signs start appearing for the crossings into syria. In the villages here at night, you can sometimes hear the sounds of artillery fire thudding across the frontier; occasionally, a shell lands in jordan. On the side of the road, in a shallow, sandy ravine, there's a small bedouin encampment. You can see a tent bearing the blue, sun-faded letters u.n.h.c.r. — the united nations high commissioner for refugees. A five-hundred-dollar tent goes for around a hundred dollars on the black market. We arrive in za ' atari, a village six miles east of the city of mafraq.

Today we know little more about the blind creatures than our ancestors did. Olms inhabit the cave rivers of the balkans, grow up to a foot long, can live for a century, and only need to eat once a decade, report the bbc and slate. They also lay eggs about as often, which is why the 50 to 60 olm eggs stuck to the underside of a rock in slovenia's postojna cave are so remarkable. The cave hosts a wild olm population alongside an aquarium visited by a million tourists each year. On jan. 30, a female olm chose an area in the aquarium to lay her eggs, three of which are showing promising signs of growth, biologist saso weldt says. It will likely take at least four months for the eggs to hatch. \" it is very significant because there is not a lot of data about anything [ relating to ] the reproduction of this group of animals, \" says a researcher, adding it would be \" something amazing \" if any olms hatched and developed. An olm — which the new york times describes as having a \" long sinuous body, stubby legs, and frilly gills \" — laid eggs in postojna cave in 2013, but all were eaten by other olms or never hatched. This time researchers are allowing only the mother olm access to the eggs, which she monitors with her sense of smell; any that aren't fertilized become food. Scientists are also protecting them from light and are adding extra oxygen to the area because they're vulnerable to changes in water quality and temperature. \" now it's up to them, \" says weldt. \" we are hoping that in a couple of months we can state that we have baby dragons. \" ( this is the world's largest amphibian. )",

        "summary": "Last week's police busts on occupy camps around the united states saw one of the highest-profile deployments yet of high-tech crowd control: sound cannons, reports the week. Designed to keep birds out of the way of planes at airports, the \" long range acoustic device, \" or lrad for short, blasts high-frequency sound waves over a 300-meter range, causing intense pain that can incapacitate people. Military-grade versions on the lrad can fire off sound waves north of 160 decibels, well above the point that can cause hearing loss; the model typically used by police has a maximum of just 149 decibels and is typically used around 110 decibels — akin to the noise at a rock concert. Although several media outlets have reported that police in new york and oakland used the lrads on protesters last week, the nypd denies having used its lrad as a sound cannon — instead, it insists it only used its lrad as a \" megaphone, \" to broadcast instructions to protesters.",

            "The lrad cannon fires a high-decibel, high-frequency noise that can cause extreme pain. Lradx.com riot police have begun deploying a non-lethal weapon called a long range acoustic device — lrad, for short — against occupy movement protesters across the country. A controversial military device, which blasts targets with powerful sound waves capable of causing \" extreme pain, \" the lrad can sometimes even lead to permanent hearing loss. A tamer version of the device has been spotted during the recent evictions at new york's zuccotti park and occupy oakland's encampment. Here's what you should know: how does it work? lrad systems are used by airports \" to sonically deter birds from residing in the paths of aircrafts, \" says roberto baldwin at gizmodo. But in military situations, the lrad is aimed like a beam to debilitate anyone within its 300-meter range with high-pitched frequencies. What happens when the cannon is aimed at a human? you might get a headache, feel extreme pain, or even lose your hearing. Think of it this way — a conversation in a restaurant is roughly 60 decibels. A dishwasher is 80. A live rock concert is 110. And \" human discomfort \" starts when a noise hits 120 decibels — imagine a chainsaw. Permanent damage starts at 130 decibels, and at 140 decibels, targets \" could potentially lose their balance and be unable to move out of the path of the audio, \" says baldwin. While a military-grade lrad 2000x can go north of 160 decibels, baldwin says police generally use a less potent version of the device, the lrad 500x, which has the ability to blast out 110 decibels.

            "The lrad cannon fires a high-decibel, high-frequency noise that can cause extreme pain. Lradx.com riot police have begun deploying a non-lethal weapon called a long range acoustic device — lrad, for short — against occupy movement protesters across the country. A controversial military device, which blasts targets with powerful sound waves capable of causing \" extreme pain, \" the lrad can sometimes even lead to permanent hearing loss. A tamer version of the device has been spotted during the recent evictions at new york's zuccotti park and occupy oakland's encampment. Here's what you should know: how does it work? lrad systems are used by airports \" to sonically deter birds from residing in the paths of aircrafts, \" says roberto baldwin at gizmodo. But in military situations, the lrad is aimed like a beam to debilitate anyone within its 300-meter range with high-pitched frequencies. What happens when the cannon is aimed at a human? you might get a headache, feel extreme pain, or even lose your hearing. Think of it this way — a conversation in a restaurant is roughly 60 decibels. A dishwasher is 80. A live rock concert is 110. And \" human discomfort \" starts when a noise hits 120 decibels — imagine a chainsaw. Permanent damage starts at 130 decibels, and at 140 decibels, targets \" could potentially lose their balance and be unable to move out of the path of the audio, \" says baldwin. While a military-grade lrad 2000x can go north of 160 decibels, baldwin says police generally use a less potent version of the device, the lrad 500x, which has the ability to blast out 110 decibels. And lrads have been used on occupiers? they have. In the clearing of protesters from zuccotti park earlier this week, the \" nypd descended on the park with deafening...

        "summary": "Pity, poor veishnoria. Russia and belarus are conquering the nation with a mighty show of military force that began on thursday. Veishnoria, fortunately, happens to be a fictional nation invented for six days of intense war games. In fact, this year's zapad games ( \" zapad \" means \" west \" ) amount to perhaps the biggest display of military power by russia since the end of the cold war, reports the wall street journal. Vladimir putin even skipped the current un forum to observe. Given moscow's tense relations with the west at the moment, the display is drawing lots of worried attention. Details: how big? russia insists that only 12,700 troops are taking part, conveniently below the threshold of 13,000 that would require allowing international observers, reports abc news. Nato officials estimate the real number is somewhere between 70,000 and 100,000. The real thing: want to know what a russian war with nato would look like? this display is an accurate preview, reports the washington post, which provides details on the ground and air weaponry involved. All of it shows off russia's beefed-up power after a decade of upgrades. Too worried? the games have russia's neighbors and the west worried about a dress rehearsal for an attack, though a piece at new york suggests that putin might be playing mind games as well. It collects a quote from the finnish defense minister, who says the worried reaction is precisely what putin wanted: \" western countries have taken the bait completely, they've plugged the exercises so much. \" then again...: the guardian notes that similar war games in 2013 were followed by russia's annexation of crimea and intervention in ukraine, while games in 2008 were followed by the invasion of georgia. Already, concerns are being raised that russia will leave a large contingent in belarus when the games are over. Government officials in estonia and lithuania have publicly voiced concerns. And sweden launched military exercises of its own on repelling an invasion, reports reuters. Hail veishnoria: russia not only invented veishnoria but lubenia and vesbasriya as imaginary foes for the simulation, and they're thought to be stand-ins for latvia, lithuania, and poland. All three fictional nations now have robust, if satirical, presences online, with fake twitter accounts and histories, notes the new york times.",

        "summary": "The estate of nina simone had some extremely harsh words this week for zoe saldana, the actress playing the late singer and activist in a new film, rollingstone reports. Saldana tweeted a simone quote when the trailer for nina was released tuesday. The official nina simone twitter account responded a day later: \" cool story but please take nina's name out your mouth. For the rest of your life. \" the long-in-development film has been criticized for casting saldana, who looks little like simone, then darkening her skin and giving her a fake nose. In 2012, simone's daughter, lisa simone kelly, said the casting was particularly bad because her mother was put down specifically for her nose and skin color. But time reports simone kelly has softened — at least toward saldana — recently, saying the actress deserves better than the tweet from the nina simone account. \"it's unfortunate that zoe saldana is being attacked so viciously … when she's not responsible for any of the writing or the lies, \" simone kelly says. She says the blame instead should go to director cynthia mort. Aside from saldana's casting, the simone family takes issue with the entire plot of nina, which it says is based on a relationship between simone and her manager that never happened. It's unclear who runs the nina simone twitter account, though it's possibly a family friend put in charge of the facebook page a few years ago. Meanwhile, vulture has a list of seven actresses who should play nina simone.",

        "summary": "With election day less than 100 hours away, hillary clinton and donald trump both plan to spend part of their saturdays in florida, which the bbc describes as the biggest swing state — and, with 29 electoral votes, a must-win for trump. The republican, who has edged ahead in recent florida polls, plans to visit north carolina and nevada later in the day, while clinton plans to appear alongside katy perry at a saturday night rally in pennsylvania. A round-up of election coverage: beyonce was joined by backup dancers in blue pantsuits at a get-out-the-vote concert in cleveland friday night, the ap reports. Husband jay-z also performed at the event, where clinton told the crowd: \" help us win ohio. \" at an event in hershey, pa.the same evening, trump bragged that he had drawn a huge crowd on his own, without having \" to bring j-lo or jay-z. \" according to fivethirtyeight, nationwide polls show that clinton's slide has stopped and she may even be regaining ground. But state polls paint a different picture, with the race now a dead heat in new hampshire and clinton's lead shrinking in michigan and pennsylvania. Politico reports that clinton made a campaign stop in detroit friday night, which hinted at her campaign's worries about winning michigan in the wake of the fbi's announcements. The ap reports that president obama, who campaigned for clinton in north carolina on friday, has been using a slogan that appears to be this election's yes we can: \" c ' mon, man. \" the latest washington post poll finds that clinton has a 4-point lead over trump, at 47 % to 43 %, with gary johnson at 4 % and jill stein at 2 %. Trump supporters, however, are more likely to say they are following the election \" very closely, \" suggesting they are more likely to turn out to vote. The hill reports that two factors appear to be working in trump's favor: johnson voters are deserting the libertarian candidate for him, and republicans previously uncomfortable about voting for trump are \" coming home. \" buzzfeed reports on an unlikely source of fake anti-clinton news: a small town in macedonia, which is home to more than 100 pro-trump websites.

The battle plan against comey, obtained by cnn, calls for branding the nation's former top law enforcement official as \" lyin ' comey \" through a website, digital advertising and talking points to be sent to republicans across the country before his memoir is released next week.

            "( cnn ) former fbi director james comey warned that if president donald trump ever tries to fire special counsel robert mueller, then it would be the president's \" most serious attack yet on the rule of law, \" and said that \" it's possible \" the russians could have information on trump that could be used to compromise him. Comey also said trump is \" morally unfit to be president \" and claimed there is \" certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice \" by trump. The comments came during a wide-ranging, exclusive interview with abc news chief anchor george stephanopoulos. The media appearance is the first time comey has sat for a televised interview since trump fired him last year. It also kicks off a promotional tour that the former fbi director is embarking on to promote the release of his new book, \" a higher loyalty. \" during the interview"

Reuters reports that canadian company cannabix will be the likely winner, given that it has a prototype device now being tested that can detect the presence of thc, the active ingredient in marijuana. Another contender is lifeloc, based in colorado, whose chief executive cautions that the first versions of these devices will be relatively primitive. \" i think the first breathalyzer on the market will be a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' for the presence of thc at the time of the test, and in that sense it won't provide a quantitative evidential measure, \" says barry knott. In other words, the devices will be able to tell a police officer if you've got marijuana in your system, but not if you're actually impaired. Medical daily notes that \" not enough is known yet about exactly how much is needed to impair driving abilities, \" and thus there's much confusion and inconsistency among states trying to impose such laws. ( washington and montana, for instance, have set a 5 nanograms/milliliter limit for drivers; in other states, the limit is zero. ) engadget echoes that, predicting that \" until both the science and policy surrounding cannabis advance beyond their present states, don't expect these devices to be entered into evidence in your dui case anytime soon. \" still, the market is clearly there: lifeloc, for example, thinks it will be able to sell its first models for about $ 3,000, about 10 times the price of its alcohol breathalyzers.

Yael stone, the 33-year-old actress who plays lorna morello on the netflix series, \" is scared \" and not sleeping, she tells bari weiss in the new york times. That's because she's coming forward with accusations against \" one of our national treasures, \" as stone puts it to leigh sales in an interview for the abc's 7.30 show. Stone says when she worked with rush, now 67, on a stage production of the diary of a madman eight years ago, he used a mirror to watch her as she showered, sent her erotic texts, and danced naked in front of her in their shared dressing room, among other things. Stone says she didn't speak up earlier ( though she says she did once write rush a letter that he never responded to ) because she feared offending her \" onetime hero, \" as well as being sued for defamation under australia's strict libel laws. She feels some sympathy for rush, noting that because the very famous are rarely told no, they may engage in behaviors that get incrementally worse. \" we need compassion for that confusion, \" she says. In a statement, rush says he regrets any \" distress \" stone felt from the \" spirited enthusiasm i generally bring to my work, \" adding that her memories \" are incorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context. \" stone told sales she recognizes the possible repercussions, both financial and for her place in the acting world, for speaking out. \" if that happens, i think it's worth it, \" she said.

Thirty-nine people in seven states have been sickened so far, 12 of them petland employees and the other 27 people who had contact with puppies sold in the store, live science reports. Though no deaths have been attributed to the outbreak, nine of those infected have been hospitalized within the last year. The cdc says campylobacter outbreaks are rare, since people usually get the bacteria from their own dogs, generally through contact with feces. The cdc launched its investigation into the outbreak after the first case was reported last september, and the agency has been getting help from state health departments and the usda's animal and plant health inspection service, fox news reports. Petland is also cooperating with the investigation. People who come down with campylobacter generally show symptoms within two to five days of exposure to the bacteria, and people with weakened immune systems, the very young, and the very old are the most vulnerable.

Sulzberger as \"a firm believer in the importance of a free and independent press, one that isn't afraid to seek the truth, hold those in power accountable and tell the stories that need to be told. \" mr. Sulzberger's insistence on independence was shown in his decision in 1971 to publish a secret government history of the vietnam war known as the pentagon papers. It was a defining moment for him and, in the view of many journalists and historians, his finest. In thousands of pages, this highly classified archive detailed washington's legacy of deceit and evasion as it stumbled through an unpopular war. When the pentagon papers were divulged in a series of articles in june 1971, an embarrassed nixon administration demanded that the series be stopped immediately, citing national security considerations. The times refused, on first amendment grounds, and won its case in the united states supreme court in a landmark ruling on press freedom. Mr. Sulzberger reshaped the times. In the mid-1970s, another financially difficult period in which he might have chosen to retrench, he expanded the paper to four sections from two, creating separate sections for metropolitan and business news and introducing new ones oriented toward consumers. They were a gamble, begun in the hope of attracting new readers, especially women,"

Aimee lucido, an uber software engineer, offers an extended take on medium, noting, \" i think this is disgusting and appalling and horrifying and yet i am not surprised at all. \" she also reveals she's one of \" the 60 % \" … of women who've been \" sexually harassed in silicon valley. \" both justin bariso of inc.

Kara swisher agrees kalanick \" has done douche as a tactic very well indeed \" in her post for recode, but it's fowler's anecdote about the leather jackets uber wouldn't order for its female employees that swisher says \" drives it all home to a surreal level. \" uber board member arianna huffington has launched an investigation into what's going on at the company, per the verge, which has posted the short memo she sent out to uber employees.

The suit, filed by state trooper brienne splittgerber, led gov. Pete ricketts to order an investigation into the matter, the omaha world-herald reports. The lawsuit alleges that female recruits were required to be naked from the waist down in order to undergo a vaginal and rectal exam, which splittgerber says she was told was to check for hernias. The suit says male recruits were not made to undergo the same exams, with just one possible exception. A state patrol spokesperson says no recruits have been subjected to the exams since december 2016, per the ap. Splittgerber says after her exam in 2014, her family doctor told her the exam had been medically unnecessary. An ob-gyn explains to the ap that, in order to check for a hernia, there would be no need to undress or to have the \" genital or anal area \" probed. Splittgerber complained to her superiors and was told an investigation was underway, but her lawsuit says nothing was done for three years. It also accuses officials of attempting a cover-up. \" subjecting the plaintiff and other female trooper candidates to a medically unnecessary and sexually invasive procedure is outrageous conduct [ that ] goes beyond all possible bounds of decency and is utterly intolerable in a civilized community, \" says the lawsuit.

It's about exploring something very familiar that has never been available before: staying in touch with past and present friends and acquaintances in a single, potentially infinite, virtual space. The phenomenon challenges us psychologically, creating situations that previously were not possible. Before the rise of social networking, former friends and acquaintances would tend to drift away from us and potentially become consigned to our personal histories. Having a virtual space with ( re ) active people constantly updating their activities is the basic, powerful fascination of the social network. But there's another attraction, based on the elusive sport ( or perhaps urge ) to position ourselves.
