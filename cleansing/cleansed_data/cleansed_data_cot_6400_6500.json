The wife of president donald trump, 70, is gorgeous, and was even a model in the 1990s. Her official portrait in the role of first lady exudes class and sophistication, showing melania, 46, in a smart black suit and a delicate black scarf, with minimal yet impactful makeup. Her peachy lipgloss and french manicure are understated, and appropriate for a political office. She looks fabulous! but … she also looks airbrushed to high heavens. Don't you agree? her face is overly smoothed, and there isn't a flyaway hair to be seen. There's photoshop, and then there's photoshop. While melania looks amazing, she also appears to be the victim of runaway retouching. But, whatever. It's not like melania cares what us mere mortals think; she looks insanely pretty in this photo, and she ' ll continue to be flawless without approval. Melania's official white house portrait is definitely taken in a different light than her husband's. President trump's portrait is hardened and tough, while hers is incredibly soft and warm.

The revelation is the latest twist in the feud between armstrong and 60 minutes, which reported last week that saugy had made such claims. Saugy denied this, saying the us team's samples had been suspicious, but he wasn't sure if armstrong's specific sample was tainted. But that's not what he told us authorities, according to a source with inside knowledge of the investigation. Saugy told them about armstrong's tests on three occasions, and agreed to turn over the results. He never actually produced those results, however, prompting a letter from us authorities in april that asked him to submit his evidence. That letter was obtained by 60 minutes. Armstrong's lawyer has already criticized the ap report, calling it a \" lawless form of character assassination, \" and surmising that the ap source is the same as cbs '. Meanwhile, the hollywood reporter notes that 60 minutes refuses to back down. Instead of uttering the apology armstrong wanted, cbs news chair jeff fager issued the following: \" 60 minutes stands by its story as truthful, accurate, and fair. \"",

Burwell — the case that could decide the fate of the affordable care act — the liberal justices sounded predictably in favor of the law, the conservative justices sounded predictably opposed, and the two wild cards of kennedy and roberts left things a little muddy. Chief justice roberts, who voted previously to uphold the law, \" said almost nothing, \" reports the new york times. As for kennedy, at one point he sounded skeptical of the challenge to obamacare, but then quickly acknowledged that the plaintiffs might be correct, reports usa today. Some specifics on kennedy: washington post: \" if there was a reason for optimism for the obama administration, it came from \" kennedy. He \" questioned whether the challengers'reading of the law — that federal tax subsidies should only be available in the 16 states and district of columbia that have set up their own insurance marketplaces — would cause'serious constitutional problems ' of coercion. \" scotusblog: kennedy was \" very attentive to the consequences of the reading that the petitioners urged. He seemed to realize that state legislators would be in an impossible position under that reading — more or less forced to ' adopt ' or ' endorse'the aca system in order to avoid unmanageable consequences in their states. His plausible conclusion was that congress either did not intend to put them to that choice, or that the statute shouldn't be read to have done so... \" associated press: kennedy \" asked questions of both sides that made it hard to tell where he might come out this time. \"",

The doctor behind the report now says that exclusion \" might've made a difference. \" the hiv rate in gay and bisexual black men in america is higher than that of any country in the world. The new york times, in an eye-opening report, calls it \" one of america's most troubling public-health crises. \" swaziland has the highest hiv rate in the world at 28.8 %. The lifetime risk of hiv diagnosis in the us is about 1 %. But according to the cdc, if current trends hold, the hiv rate for gay and bisexual black men in america will reach 50 %. The problem is worst in the south. Already in jackson, mississippi, the hiv rate among gay and bisexual men is 40 %. In 2003, congress passed a $ 15 billion plan to fight hiv/aids in africa. There was no such funding or plan for black americans fighting the disease. A 2014 study found it would take an extra $ 2.5 billion to make actual progress on the crisis affecting america's gay and bisexual black men. But that's not likely to happen; in fact, the situation will almost assuredly get worse. The trump administration disabled the office of national aids policy website and proposed cutting the cdc's funding for hiv/aids prevention, testing, and support by $ 186 million. There are fears that abolishing obamacare will return the country to a time of an hiv medication waiting list that is thousands of people deep.

Cookies with human remains? that's the snack that at least one california student reportedly brought to da vinci charter academy high school in davis, per the san francisco chronicle, containing the not-appetizing ingredient of a grandparent's ashes. The chronicle says it was her grandmother's remains, fox40 says it was her grandfather's, but either way, lt. Paul doroshov of the davis police department says nine students were reportedly given the cookies on oct. 4 ( it's not clear how many, if any, ate the cookies ), and students are speaking to the media about their experience, per kcra. \" i was kind of horrified, \" andy knox says after a girl offered him a cookie with \" her grandpa's ashes. \" knox says the girl had whipped out an urn, supposedly with those same ashes, in class. Doroshov says one student is believed to have baked the cookies, and a second helped distribute them; kcra suggests they were related. The family of one student tells fox40 they're upset with the school, which had their son sign a statement on the incident and told him to keep quiet. \" the district seems to be a little bit more concerned about protecting themselves than protecting their students, \" the boy's father says. A statement from the principal notes, \" i can say that those who were involved are remorseful and this is now a personal family matter. \" it doesn't appear anyone became ill, doroshov tells abc 7. It's unclear whether anyone will be charged with what doroshov calls an \" unconventional \" crime, per cbs news, as cops say the incident may not be covered even by little-known california rules on human remains.

The tweet in question: trump's retweet of an insulting image of heidi cruz. Kelly's response: \" seriously? \" as the reporter notes, trump's tweet has been criticized as sexist, and it was kelly questioning trump about whether he's sexist that first started the feud between the two. More reactions: wednesday night, trump campaign spokesperson stephen miller defended the retweet on cnn, the daily beast reports. He told anchor kate bolduan that trump simply \" responded as any normal person would \" to a \" vicious, mean-spirited, uncalled-for attack \" on his wife melania. That attack refers to an ad by an anti-trump super pac that mocks melania's nude gq photo shoot, but ted cruz's campaign itself is not responsible for the ad. A clearly incredulous bolduan questioned why trump was keeping the issue alive via his retweet, and added, \" as a woman, it's demeaning to not only ted cruz's wife, it's demeaning to melania trump, because she's got a lot more going for her than just her looks, and you don't see that in this retweet. \" she and miller continued to argue about the issue throughout the 5-and-a-half-minute segment. Salon calls the retweet \" a new low in this grotesque sausage-waving campaign, \" but vox notes that it fits perfectly into trump's campaign strategy: he's stayed on top by dominating the news cycle, even when he has to use personal attacks to do so, but \" this tactic works for trump, and trump only. \" when other presidential contenders have attempted to use the same tactic in response to trump, it has backfired big-time.",

Three years ago, hall of famer junior seau shot himself in the chest with no suicide note after seven years of insomnia left him too depressed to continue. Two years before, he had survived his car's 100-foot fall off a cliff. Five neuroscientists said seau's brain showed signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( cte ) — or concussion-induced depression or dementia. The science says his death was from football. There are now 30 former nfl players who have committed suicide. Many shot themselves in the head. One, jovan belcher, killed his girlfriend, then drove to his team's practice facility to shoot himself. Former steeler terry long drank antifreeze to escape years of clinical depression. Doctors say it was from football.

So what did sony do? they brought the nfl in to basically water down the depictions of the effects of the head injuries on the football players and how the nfl reacted to the controversy around the injuries. I found a bunch of emails relating to this so please don't mind this long post listing much of what was said in this regard... \" but in addition to all that i learned just today that our lawyers have told us that we can't recreate the games and have to use actual footage which should be possible under the fair acts law( which need to to understand better ) butof course the problem there is that the footage can only be obtained through the nfl so before we go off to the races we need to",

Three years ago, hall of famer junior seau shot himself in the chest with no suicide note after seven years of insomnia left him too depressed to continue. Two years before, he had survived his car's 100-foot fall off a cliff. Five neuroscientists said seau's brain showed signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( cte ) — or concussion-induced depression or dementia. The science says his death was from football. There are now 30 former nfl players who have committed suicide. Many shot themselves in the head. One, jovan belcher, killed his girlfriend, then drove to his team's practice facility to shoot himself. Former steeler terry long drank antifreeze to escape years of clinical depression. Doctors say it was from football. America's favorite sport — at the professional level — is being revealed as organized barbarism, and the nfl has been hushing its involvement in incentivizing skull-crushing hits while being aware of their deadly impact for years.

New york city mayor bill de blasio announced friday that rikers island jail will be closed. \" it will take many years, \" cnn quotes de blasio as saying. \" but it will happen. \" last year, the jail at rikers island was home to more than 10,000 inmates — most of them awaiting trial and not convicted of a crime. That same year, there were nearly 12,000 instances of violence there. According to the new york times, rikers has a \" history of brutal violence \" by both inmates and corrections officers. In one of the most notorious cases, a 16-year-old was held at rikers for three years — 800 of those days in solitary confinement — while subjected to horrific abuse. He eventually killed himself. Advocates give a number of reasons to close the 85-year-old rikers island jail: newer and safer jails for both inmates and guards, reduced travel time for inmates, and easier visitation for family, to name a few. While details of the plan to close rikers haven't been laid out, de blasio gives a timeline of 10 years to reduce the prison population to 5,000 prior to closure. He says closing rikers will \" end the era of mass incarceration \" in new york city. Last year, an independent commission recommended moving rikers inmates to smaller jails to be built in each of new york's five boroughs at a cost of $ 10.6 billion. It's unclear if that's the current plan.",

        "summary": "It takes a woman until the following tuesday to earn what a man does in a single week, and more than 15 months to earn what a man does in a year, according to the national committee on pay equity. That's why tuesday is equal pay day, representing how far into 2017 women have had to work to draw even with men in 2016, explains nbc news. The news, however, isn't all bleak in the eyes of facebook's sheryl sandberg. A look at coverage: rallies are being held around the country to raise awareness. But the #20percentcounts retail campaign, in which companies are offering 20 % discounts to women ( and men as well ) in 25 cities, is another way organizers hope to make a splash, per a news release. Karin agness at forbes takes issue with what she calls a \" flawed holiday. \" the stat that women earn 20 % less \" does not factor in many of the choices that women and men make — including education, years of experience and hours worked — that influence earnings. \" emily martin of the national women's law center disagrees, laying out four reasons in us news and world report for the pay inequity. No. 1: studies showing that women get paid less than men for the same work. Unless the gap is closed, a typical 20-year-old woman starting full-time work today will make $ 418,800 less than her male counterpart over a 40-year career. A post at linkedin finds that fewer than 30 % of those employed in the top 100 highest paying jobs in america are women. Many of those jobs are found in male-dominated industries, like tech. Four years after publishing lean in, her book on women in the workforce, sandberg tells usa today that \" we are not better off \" in terms of female leadership. But in the q&a, she also says she's optimistic because of all the growing \" energy \" around the subject. Money describes four victories in the fight for equal pay over the last year, including the usa women's hockey team's successful fight for raises. Nebraska republican sen. Deb fischer hopes to score another win. At cnn, she lays out the goals of two bills she's sponsored, one of which would prevent retaliatory action against employees who ask for salary information.

Customs officials became suspicious when victoria faren, traveling with her daughter in april, kept changing her story when asked how much money she had on her. The $ 200 she initially revealed quickly multiplied as officials discovered $ 8,000 crammed in wallets, $ 4,000 in a cloth sack, nearly $ 1,000 in sealed envelopes, $ 3,000 in faren's shirt, $ 2,000 sewn into her bra strap, and — when authorities noticed a bulge in her backside — a whopping $ 21,000 in her girdle, according to abc news. Why did she do it? court documents say faren had already wired some money ( from her $ 120,000 home sale ) to the philippines, but was afraid to mail the rest and figured she wasn't allowed to fly with it — though us customs makes clear that she only had to fill out a form. Authorities say they don't have to give her the money back because it was a \" currency reporting violation \" that involved \" bulk cash smuggling, \" notes the free press. Her daughter says she had no clue about faren's covert cash, and adds that \" her mother [ is ] old. \" ( at least authorities didn't find any live animals stuffed in her suitcase. )",

        "summary": "The discovery of a mass grave is by its nature a gruesome find, but what researchers uncovered in the ancient maya city of uxul in present-day mexico is that to the extreme. University of bonn archaeologists on tuesday announced that they have found a 1,400-year-old grave containing the dismembered bones of two dozen people, reports nature world news. What those bones reveal is twofold: first, the dead were no lowly individuals, as evidenced by the presence of bits of jade that had been inserted into holes drilled in some of the teeth. Second, they prove a bit of history: \" that the dismemberment of prisoners of war and opponents often represented in maya art was in fact practiced, \" says the dig's lead. Archaeologist nicolaus seefield found the gravesite in an \" artificial cave, \" which he explains to livescience had likely functioned as a water reservoir before the burial \" since the cave's floor was perfectly clean. \" the skeletons found there were not \" in their original anatomical articulation, \" he says. \" the observed hatchet marks on the cervical vertebra are a clear indication of decapitation \"; most had their lower jaw detached, and the \" spatial pattern \" of the bones is consistent with dismemberment. The archaeologists believe the dead were either prisoners of war or uxul nobles; they hope upcoming isotope analysis will reveal whether they were from uxul — which is near what is now the guatemala border — or elsewhere. Neat fact from livescience: \" uxul \" means \" at the end. \" ( it wasn't the only mayan discovery of the summer: a \" lost \" maya city was discovered in june. )",

        "summary": "Burma is continuing to move toward meeting the west's demands with surprising speed. Dozens of its best known political prisoners were freed today in the country's most sweeping prisoner release yet, reports the new york times. Those freed include leaders of 1988's failed pro-democracy uprising, ethnic minority leaders, monks arrested in the 2007 protests, journalists, and former prime minister khin nyunt, who was jailed in 2005 after falling out of favor with the ruling junta. Just yesterday, burma signed a cease-fire with ethnic karen rebels, who had been fighting for greater autonomy for more than 60 years. As many as a thousand political prisoners are still behind bars, however, and economic sanctions are likely to remain in place at least until elections are held in april. \" i think we are close to the removal of western sanctions, \" an analyst tells the ap, but \" there's a sense that there's still more to go before the sanctions will be removed. \"",

The two veteran officers, one male and one female, were gunned down when they arrived at the home of a suspect who was killed in a shootout with police officers half an hour later, reports the santa cruz sentinel, which notes that the police deaths are the first in the line of duty in the history of the city of 60,000. The dead suspect has been identified as jeremy goulet, a 35-year-old barista who was arrested and fired last week after a co-worker in a santa cruz coffee shop told police that he went to her house and made inappropriate sexual advances, the ap reports. Goulet was sentenced to three years of probation in portland, oregon, in 2008 after being convicted of peeping at a woman showering and carrying a concealed weapon without a permit, the oregonian adds.",

Indiana university freshman lukas cavar, 19, was on a beginner's spelunking trip to sullivan cave on sunday when he ended up getting left behind by the 12 other members of iu's caving club. He got separated from the group and reached the cave entrance, only to find that it had been padlocked shut by the departed spelunkers — and he ended up stuck in that cave for 60 hours. Exactly how that happened is somewhat of a mystery, reports the indiana daily student: the caving club says it did a headcount at the beginning and end of the outing, and the cavers were buddied up. It wouldn't further elaborate on the \" sensitive legal matter. \" what cavar had on him: a plastic grocery store bag, his relatively useless iphone ( no signal ), two empty water bottles, two clif bar wrappers, his wallet, and helmet. He estimates he spent six to eight hours yelling for help, and licked moisture from the cave's walls to try to satisfy his thirst. Two club members rescued him late tuesday after a friend told the club's president cavar was missing. Cavar says he's \" really glad to be alive; \" the ap reports he has no upcoming spelunking plans. ( this lost trekker survived on a ledge for 47 days. )",

Kashin was not robbed of his cellphone or wallet, television reports said.mikhail fedotov, the secretary of the russian union of journalists, pointed to the bludgeoning of kashin's hands as particularly sinister. \" what's so utterly disgusting about the case is that the attackers did their utmost if not to kill kashin but to maim him gravely enough to prevent him from ever being physically able to write again, \" fedotov said.fedotov said kashin's beating was the fifth attack on russian journalists in just the last 30 days, adding to a climate of intimidation in a country that has seen growing protests over limits on personal liberties.medvedev wrote on his twitter blog that he had ordered the prosecutor general's office and the interior",

Russian media said oleg kashin was in hospital in an induced coma and police were treating the attack as a case of attempted murder. President dmitry medvedev has said \" the criminals must be found and punished. \" mr kashin's editor said the attack was retribution for articles he wrote. He has recently covered anti-kremlin protests and extremist rallies. Kommersant editor mikhail mikhailin told moscow radio: \" it's clear that the people who did this did not like what he says and writes. \" the russian prosecutor general will personally oversee the case, according to tass news agency. Serious injuries kommersant said in a statement that mr kashin was attacked outside his moscow apartment building in the early hours of saturday. He had a fractured jaw, broken shins and injuries to his fingers and skull. In recent months mr kashin had been reporting on demonstrations against the building of a highway through khimki forest outside moscow which has now been put on hold by the government. Attacks on journalists are not uncommon in russia. Human rights groups say there have been 19 unsolved murders of journalists since 2000 and that investigations into attacks lead nowhere.

The daily mail quotes him as saying \" things were not looking good.

But the ordeal is not entirely over: the guardian reports allen is now receiving no shortage of criticism over his decision to make the trek to hopefully reconnect with the yaifo tribe without any type of tracking device, leading others to suspect it was all a stunt ( \" utterly not true, \" says his agent ). Still others are bothered at the press coverage, with the paper quoting one such criticism, from an ethnomusicologist who spent a decade in papua new guinea: \" why should we care about a lost, unprepared, silly, white privileged male middle-aged fool? all of the stories have been solely focused on his'safety, ' when png faces some real challenges that are genuinely worthy of reporting. \" ( allen once ate his dog to survive. )",

When you look at someone else's shining educational and professional accomplishments, it's easy to feel that the person in question is far more impressive than yourself. But any accomplished résumé – or cv, as non-americans and some in the professional class like to call them – hides secrets. If you could read between the lines of the many successes that are recorded in a résumé, you would probably see far more failures: schools people didn't get into; scholarship essays that were toiled over and rejected; job applications that now seem harebrained.

In fact, his suit failed to cite any of the things the announcers actually did say, none of which the judge found to be defamatory anyway. \"at worst, the announcers ' comments might be considered to be loose, figurative or hyperbolic, \" wrote judge julia rodriguez.

        "summary": "Sure, people become sexually active under countless circumstances for countless reasons and at many different ages, but at least part of the timing appears to come down to our genes, cambridge university researchers report in the journal nature. Studying the genes and life histories of nearly 400,000 people, they conclude \" there is a heritable component to age at first sex, \" reproductive aging expert john perry tells the guardian, \" and the heritability is about 25 %, so one-quarter nature, three-quarters nurture. \" genes also appear to influence the age of the onset of puberty, first birth of a child, and even total number of offspring, reports the telegraph. Perry's example: the genetic variant in cadm2 is associated with higher odds of risk-taking, earlier sex, and a greater number of children. So what accounts for the other 75 %? new scientist reports that previous research has found teens are more likely to become sexually active younger if they are not religious, come from poorer families, and if their parents didn't get involved in their lives. But this study found that the earlier onset of puberty is associated with earlier sexual activity, notes popular science. In the mid-1800s, for instance, girls were getting their period at an average age of 18 — a number that plummeted to age 12 by 1980. Earlier loss of virginity ricochets, adds a clinical epidemiologist, into \" other consequences such as, all things being equal, earlier first birth, having more children, less likely to remain childless, and poorer educational outcomes. \" future studies may look at non-western countries ( this one focused on the uk, iceland, and us ) to account for different cultures and attitudes about sex, one expert tells the verge.

Most parents and health teachers will tell you: don't have sex until you're ready. But according to a new study, that might not all be up to you. After analyzing the genetic data of more than 380,000 people, an international team of researchers has identified 38 genes that may be associated with the age at which people first had sex. The study was published",
            "When you lose your virginity and how many children you will have are partially determined by genetics, cambridge university has found. A study of over 380,000 people has identified gene mutations which influence the age of puberty, sexual intercourse, first birth and number of offspring. Previously researchers thought that such intimate decisions were based purely on social factors such as family upbringing and peer pressure. But it appears that innate traits, linked to personality, play an important role. In the nature versus nurture debate, scientists believe that 25 per cent",
            "The subtle impact of genetics on the age at which people lose their virginity has been teased apart by scientists and shown to have an effect on how well people fare at school. Though mostly driven by upbringing and peer behaviour, a person's age when they first have sex is also shaped by biological factors where genes have a role to play. Researchers found that differences in dna could account for a quarter of the variation in the age at which people lost their virginity, with other factors, among them religious beliefs,",

Most parents and health teachers will tell you: don't have sex until you're ready. But according to a new study, that might not all be up to you.

The study was published",

A study of over 380,000 people has identified gene mutations which influence the age of puberty, sexual intercourse, first birth and number of offspring. Previously researchers thought that such intimate decisions were based purely on social factors such as family upbringing and peer pressure. But it appears that innate traits, linked to personality, play an important role. In the nature versus nurture debate, scientists believe that 25 per cent",

        "summary": "Tesla's autopilot feature may have been involved in a second crash the day after the federal government launched an investigation into the feature following the first such crash, the detroit free press reports. Art gallery owner albert scaglione was driving his 2016 tesla model x on the pennsylvania turnpike with his son-in-law on july 1 when he hit a guardrail, crossed multiple lanes of traffic, hit a concrete median, and rolled over. Both scaglione and his son-in-law survived. A police officer who responded to the scene says scaglione told him he was using the vehicle's autopilot feature at the time of the crash. It's the same feature a man in florida — who may or may not have been distracted by a harry potter dvd — was using during a fatal crash in may. There's no evidence the autopilot feature malfunctioned on the notoriously unforgiving pennsylvania turnpike, and tesla disputes whether scaglione was even using the feature during the crash, the star reports. According to wxyz, the company says it has no evidence the car was in autopilot and the 77-year-old scaglione appears to be ignoring their calls. Authorities are continuing to investigate the crash. Tesla states its autopilot feature is only meant to assist drivers, who still need to keep their hands on or near the steering wheel. But videos posted to youtube feature tesla drivers showing off the feature by driving hands-free, even climbing into their car's backseat.",

Suspects david eisenhauer and natalie keepers planned the crime, they said thursday, deciding together that eisenhauer would cut lovell's throat at a remote location they pre-selected, and going to separate walmart stores to buy a shovel and cleaning supplies. According to the commonwealth prosecutor, keepers, 19, told fbi investigators that she \" was excited to be part of something secretive and special, \" and admitted to going with eisenhauer, 18, to buy the shovel before the alleged murder and the cleaning supplies after, while lovell's body was in the trunk of eisenhauer's lexus. The prosecutor says keepers told police where lovell's body was and where to find the cleaning supplies and a minions blanket of lovell's in keepers'dorm room, abc news reports. Authorities say the duo planned for eisenhauer to \" lure \" lovell away from home \" on the guise of a date, \" according to the roanoke times. But keepers insists she wasn't present at the actual murder, and says she's long struggled with her mental health and self-mutilation. The relationship between her and eisenhauer isn't entirely clear; they went to high schools five miles apart in columbia, maryland, and then both attended virginia tech. Keepers'dad says they just learned about eisenhauer in october, and that he \" dropped everything \" last year to rush keepers to the hospital when she needed an emergency appendectomy. As for lovell, she's said to have used social media to escape the bullying she experienced in seventh grade, including kik messenger, an app on which she apparently met eisenhauer. She told 8-year-old friends she was going to sneak out to meet \" david, \" her 18-year-old \" boyfriend. \" eisenhauer initially denied all involvement, but ultimately admitted he watched lovell climb out her window, gave her a side hug, and brought her to keepers.",

The woman smiles, saunters over, then shoves a capsule of detergent into his mouth and shoves him headfirst into the washing machine. When he finally emerges, he's … a chinese man, with the tag \" change begins with qiaobi \" and the man's original skin color basically \" scrubbed off, \" as quartz puts it. The wall street journal notes the ad, which incited outrage outside of china, initially didn't attract much attention there — perhaps because of continuing racism in china, where quartz notes black people are often referred to by the local term for \" black ghost. \" the los angeles times even links some of china's racist advertising history back to the west, where blacks were \" metaphors for filthiness \" in old american and british soap ads. But after the global hubbub over the qiaobi ad, quartz notes, people in china started attacking it, too, commenting on the weibo social network that it was \" horrible, \" \" disgusting, \" and \" racist. \" a rep for shanghai leishang cosmetics co., the company said to produce the detergent, told the journal he didn't really know about the ad. The promo can't even claim points for creativity: shanghaiist says it's a \" blatant ripoff \" — down to the song playing in the background — of a similarly racist italian ad from nearly a decade ago.

In the largest study of its kind, the researchers looked at up to 20 years of medical records from almost 2 million people, average age 55, and found that people classed as underweight or on the low side of normal were 34 % more likely to develop dementia than people considered to be at a normal weight. Contradictory to earlier — but much smaller — studies, the researchers found that the risk continued to decrease as weight increased, with overweight people 18 % less likely to develop dementia, and obese people 29 % less likely, the bbc reports. \" the reasons for and public health consequences of these findings need further investigation, \" the researchers write in the lancet. \" we haven't been able to find an explanation, \" the lead researcher tells the guardian. \" we are left with this finding which overshadows all the previous studies put together. The question is whether there is another explanation for it. In epidemiology, you are always left with the question of whether there is another factor. \" he stresses that the study should not be used as an excuse for overeating, because even if obesity does have a protective effect, \" you may not live long enough to benefit. \" in a statement, an alzheimer's society spokesman says that while the study shows the need for more research, people are still encouraged to keep their brains healthy by not smoking, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy, balanced diet.

As well as this there was a commitment to continue to integrate health and social care systems and end the practice of ' care cramming ' by care workers. Alzheimer's society's own election manifesto called on the new government to ensure everyone diagnosed with dementia has access to a dementia adviser, demonstrate leadership in creating a dementia-friendly society and ensure that people with dementia receive the same state support as people with comparable conditions. Responding to the liberal democrat manifesto, chief executive of alzheimer's society, jeremy hughes said:'dementia is the biggest health and social care challenge facing the country.

That might not sound like an earth-shattering amount of pep, but wrigley is sensitive to the health concerns and criticisms swirling around the booming energy drink industry. They say that's why they created a new brand for the gum rather than associating it with one of their existing, potentially kid-beloved lines. Wrigley also says it is marketing the gum to adults age 25 or older, and have put a warning label on the packages saying they are \" not recommended for children or persons sensitive to caffeine. \"",

            "Ten passengers filed a lawsuit wednesday against jetblue airways, claiming they feared for their lives when a pilot had to be physically restrained after running through the cabin yelling about jesus and al-qaida during a new york-to-las vegas flight in march. The lawsuit, filed in state supreme court in queens, claims the airline was \" grossly negligent \" in allowing capt. Clayton osbon to fly. A flight attendant's ribs were bruised as passengers tried to restrain osbon, but no one on board was seriously hurt. The march 27 flight was forced to make an emergency landing in amarillo, texas. Osbon faces a hearing friday morning in amarillo to determine if he is mentally competent to stand trial. He faces federal charges of interfering with a flight crew. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison. An airline spokesman did not immediately comment wednesday on the lawsuit according to the lawsuit and a federal indictment, witnesses on flight 191 say osbon ran through the cabin in a wild rant. The first officer locked him out of the cockpit and passengers wrestled osbon to the floor. The lawsuit also claims he was \" yelling about september 11th, iraq, iran, afghanistan, al-qaida and terrorists. \" other comments, according to the suit, included: \" we're all going down \",",

In a study published this month in science of the total environment, researchers say they've found evidence of a polluted river from 7,000 years ago. Sediment from the river — now a dry riverbed — in jordan shows a high level of copper pollution, according to a press release. And there aren't really any explanations for it except early human experimentation with metallurgy. \" these populations were experimenting with fire, experimenting with pottery, and experimenting with copper ores, \" anthropologist russell adams says. Researchers were looking for clues on how humans first started transitioning from stone tools to metal ones, motherboard reports. And while the pollution in the river came before the widespread use of metallurgy, it may have been a precursor to it. It's probable people living near the river were combining charcoal and copper ore then heating it to create beads and other small items. The smelting of copper can produce waste ranging from lead and zinc to arsenic and mercury, which likely led to widespread health problems during the later bronze age.

        "summary": "Russian president vladimir putin emerged from marathon ukraine peace talks with the leaders of ukraine, france, and germany by announcing a new ceasefire deal today, but \" potential pitfalls \" abound, as per the ap. What you need to know: the timeline: putin told reporters that the ceasefire will be effective starting midnight sunday. ( another time-related number: media reports vary, but frame the deal as the result of between 15 and 17 hours of unending talks; one report says a reporter had to be treated for exhaustion. How putin put it: \" it was not the best night in my life, but the morning, i think, is good. \" ) what happens then: as the ap puts it somewhat poetically: \" guns will fall silent, heavy weapons will pull back from the front, and ukraine will trade a broad autonomy for the east to get back control of its russian border by the end of this year. \" about that autonomy: ukraine has agreed to move forward on constitutional reforms that will grant more autonomy to areas the rebels hold, explains the washington post. About those potential pitfalls: here's one: putin and ukrainian president petro poroshenko haven't come to an agreement on debaltseve, a government-held town that the rebels have been after ( it's a significant transport hub between the two main cities under their thumb in the east ). Putin says the rebels consider the ukrainian forces surrounded and expect them to surrender; ukraine disagrees. One more thing you should know: this from npr's corey flintoff: \" the long-term issues are whether ukraine will officially recognize the areas where separatists have declared independence, and give those regions power in the central government. \" deja vu all over again? in september, a ceasefire was agreed to in minsk ( where today's deal was also agreed upon ). But it never came to pass, and ukraine claims that even as the talks were under way, russia directed 50 tanks and more heavy weapons over the border. Who signed the deal? not putin or poroshenko; \" lower-level \" government reps, two rebel honchos, and a rep from a european ceasefire monitoring agency. The possible significance, per the post, of the leaders not signing. \" that suggested they were not willing to commit fully that the deal would be successful. \" the white house's next move: the administration is going to watch and see if the ceasefire takes hold before deciding on whether to send \" lethal aid. \"",

        "summary": "With plans to send humans to mars in the works, one astrobiologist says the time to prevent an interplanetary version of the revolutionary war is now. Jacob haqq-misra, who works for a nonprofit dedicated to promoting international unity in space, lays out his plan for a completely independent mars in new space. \" i propose that we liberate mars from any controlling interests of earth and allow martian settlements to develop into a second independent instance of human civilization, \" haqq-misra writes. Under his plan, colonists on mars would give up their earth citizenship, and only the new martians would be able to own land on mars. Earth governments and corporations would not be allowed to trade with the new martian civilization or interfere with any aspect of its life. Haqq-misra believes his plan would allow mars to develop its own culture, values, and — most importantly — methods of problem-solving, reports popular science. Plus, it would preclude any future war for independence from earth. But it may not be all that feasible. Smithsonian magazine reports it costs approximately $ 450 million just to get a shuttle to the international space station. Without interplanetary commerce, martians would have to rely on massive amounts of donations or completely self-sustaining colonies. And while the outer space treaty signed by 103 countries in 1967 bans nations from owning land in space, a professor of space law tells popular science colonists would still be under their home nation's laws, just like astronauts or sailors.

That's just one of a half-dozen previously undisclosed secret service gaffes since 2013 laid out in a new report labeling the force an \" agency in crisis, \" per the washington post. The report, the result of a bipartisan congressional investigation, notes many problems uncovered last year have yet to be fixed. \" perhaps the greatest threat \" to the agency is a \" staffing crisis, \" it notes. There are now 52 fewer full-time personnel than last year, even though a panel recommended 280 new staffers be added, meaning officials are overworked, per the report released thursday. It also identifies other issues, including budget cuts, \" critically low \" morale, and \" systemic mismanagement. \" the report outlines 143 breaches or attempted breaches of security in the past 10 years, per the ap. \" the agency's recent public failures are not a series of isolated events, but the product of an insular culture that has historically been resistant to change, \" the report states. It adds the dangers to obama and the 2016 presidential candidates will be greater if the secret service doesn't clean up its act. In one incident weeks ago, two people strolled into the white house grounds, past a secret service checkpoint, without being noticed. In another case, an employee wasn't checked for weapons before entering a los angeles hotel where obama was staying. \" the situation is getting worse, not better, \" says the chairman of the house oversight committee. \" the president is in jeopardy. \" a secret service rep says \" we are reviewing the report at this time and will carefully assess any recommendations made by the committee. \"",

        "summary": "With the coming of spring, people will be putting away the extra blankets that kept them warm through a chilly winter. Others in switzerland will be blanketing a glacier. As e&e news reports, huge white blankets of canvas will be used to cover the rhone glacier in the swiss alps this summer, as in the previous eight years, to slow its rapid melt. In the last century and a half, rhone glacier has retreated 4,600 feet, per live science. It's continuing to shrink by as much as 8 inches on a hot day, and has retreated some 20 feet in the last three weeks, swiss glaciologist david volken tells afp. The dirty blankets, easily mistaken for ice from afar, reflect sunlight and may help reduce melting by up to 70 %, per quartz. They allow rhone glacier's ice grotto, a major tourist attraction, to remain open through the summer. But they're only a temporary fix to a larger environmental issue. \" by the end of the century, only about 10 % of the current ice volume will remain, \" volken says. Researchers are working on solutions. According to e&e, a recent proposal on reducing ice melt suggests blowing artificial snow across a glacier to reflect sunlight. Another proposes using large wind-powered pumps to cover arctic ice in seawater that would then freeze and add to ice depth. A third proposal suggests an artificial sill could be built on the ocean floor to block the melting of glaciers from below. However, scientists warn these short-term fixes will only put off the inevitable unless greenhouse gases are largely reduced. ( this glacier recently gave up three roped-together bodies. )",

That's what the first baseman for the chicago white sox testified wednesday in miami at a trial for a baseball agent and a trainer accused of smuggling cuban baseball players, and their families, into the us, the sun sentinel reports. The 30-year-old abreu — who isn't being charged with anything and won't be if he tells the truth in court, prosecutors say — revealed to jurors he was pulling in just $ 20 a month in 2013 playing baseball in his native cuba when he hooked up with bartolo hernandez, the agent, and trainer julio estrada, who said they'd help him get to the us before a late october deadline that year to sign a white sox contract worth $ 68 million. Abreu, who testified with the help of a spanish translator, explains that before leaving cuba for the us, he went to haiti to receive fake residency documents and a phony passport under an alias. Prosecutors explain that under free-agent and immigration rules for cuban players, abreu had to prove he lived in a different foreign country other than cuba to score the lucrative us contract. But once he was on the plane headed to america, a haitian \" fixer \" told him, he'd have to somehow get rid of the fake haitian passport. And so \" i went back to my seat … ordered … a heineken beer, and then, little by little, i swallowed that first page of the passport \" that contained his photo and phony name, he told the court. The ap explains that under the now-rescinded \" wet foot, dry foot \" policy, cuban immigrants back then were permitted to stay in the us even if they had no travel papers. Abreu said the same fixer helped his girlfriend ( now wife ), parents, and other family get to the us over the next few months — and that he paid millions to hernandez and estrada for their efforts.",

Commanders at both bases that were hit contacted nato while the strikes were under way, but though they asked nato to \"get this fire to cease, \" says an army spokesperson, \"somehow it continued. \" nato, which has promised to investigate, called it a \"tragic and unintended \" incident, the ap reports. Pakistan has continued to insist the attack was unprovoked. Meanwhile, pakistan's prime minister warned there will be \"no more business as usual \" with washington, telling cnn today that the country is re-evaluating that relationship. A top adviser to afghan president hamid karzai adds that afghanistan and pakistan could be headed toward military conflict. Also today, pakistan blocked 300 trucks carrying nato supplies to afghanistan; bloomberg notes that pakistani tv has shown traffic jams and stranded supply trucks near two border crossings. The strikes have incensed pakistanis who were already angry at the us, leading one group to chant in a demonstration, \"whoever is a friend of america is a traitor to the land. \" the daily beast notes that american officials are now concerned about increased attacks on us supply routes in retaliation.",

The embattled la clippers owner has hired a prominent antitrust lawyer and informed the nba that he has no intention of paying a $ 2.5 million fine imposed for making racist remarks, sources tell sports illustrated and usa today. \" we reject your demand for payment, \" the lawyer's letter informs the league per the sources; it claims \" no punishment is warranted \" because sterling has done nothing wrong and says his \" due process rights \" have been violated. ( si notes that latter claim is somewhat backed up by the nba's quickie 4-day investigation, but that as a private association it has no obligation to provide due-process rights. ) the deadline for paying the fine actually came and went earlier this week. The letter doesn't mention the potential forced sale of the clippers, sources say, but such letters are generally considered a precursor to a lawsuit and sterling is known for his litigious tactics, reports the new york times. Any lawsuit, however, will be an uphill struggle for sterling, since he is contractually bound to follow the nba's system of justice and his claim he has done nothing wrong is at odds with his admission of a \" terrible, terrible mistake \" in a cnn interview. If he doesn't pay the fine and loses the team, the nba could withhold $ 2.5 million, plus interest, from the sale, si notes.

Flanked by a handful of bodyguards, rochelle sterling, normally a courtside fixture at clippers games, watched from a suite and quickly left the arena with her security detail as soon as the game was over. Rochelle -- or shelly, as she's more commonly known -- sat courtside sunday in oakland for game 4 of the clippers ' first-round series against the warriors in the wake of racist comments made by her husband to girlfriend v. Stiviano that were posted by tmz on friday. The clippers lead the best-of-seven series 3-2. \" it's a tough one for shelly, really, \" rivers said. \" she didn't do anything wrong.

Israel described the attacks as the start of \" an extensive program of direct offensive strikes against hamas \" and islamic jihad, cnn reports. Palestinian leaders characterized the attack as an act of war, saying israel had opened \" the gates to hell on themselves. \" one hamas official tells ynetnews that the gloves have come off, and that hamas might retaliate with suicide bombings in major israeli cities. The precision hit on military chief ahmed al-jabari's car was followed up within minutes by 20 more airstrikes, a hamas health minister said; reuters describes plumes of smoke and debris erupting as civilians ran for cover. Israel's chief military spokesman says israel was hitting targets that included underground rocket and missile caches, and warned that the conflict \" will, in my estimation, prove protracted, \" adding that israel had made preparations for a ground invasion if necessary. In other developments: reports are now coming in that israeli warships are firing on gaza from the mediterranean, the guardian's liveblog reports. Mahmoud abbas called for an emergency meeting of the arab league to discuss the attack, reuters reports. Ban ki-moon called for an \" immediate de-escalation of tensions, \" a un spokesman said. Britain likewise called for restraint. Israel has named the offensive \" pillar of cloud, \" which, gawker points out, is a reference to the form god takes in the biblical account of the israelites ' flight from egypt in order to strike terror into the egyptian army. Benjamin netanyahu defended the strikes, saying the palestinians were \" on purpose hiding behind their own citizens. We don't want to hit the citizens. And that is the difference between them and us. \" ehud barack has reportedly ordered israeli reservists called up for the operation, according to al-jazeera.",

        "summary": "While the senate intelligence committee is busy tuesday hearing testimony from attorney general jeff sessions, a committee of the egyptian parliament is discussing something a little lighter: a proposed ban on \"western \" baby names. The independent reports that mp bedier abdel aziz was set to propose a draft law to the complaints and suggestions committee that would prohibit the use of \"foreign \" names for babies born in egypt. Violators could face fines up to $ 270 or up to six months in prison. \"using such western names and abandoning arabic ones will lead to an undesired and radical change in our society and culture, \" abdel aziz told the egypt independent. He also claimed foreign names, like lara and mark, are difficult for arabs to pronounce. The draft law has inspired backlash on social media, with many condemning the proposal as a \"waste of time \" and an attack on \"personal freedom. \" according to newsweek, some commentators have also argued that the law would disproportionately affect the minority christian population in the country. If it is passed, egypt would join a few other countries that have laws related to baby names, including saudi arabia, which has banned 51 names, plus new zealand and at least five countries in western europe. Swedes, for example, are not allowed to name their children ikea. As for egypt, the name ban is only one strange piece of legislation up for debate at today's parliamentary session. Others would force facebook users to get licenses and fine couples who break off wedding engagements without good reason.",

New scientist explains his thinking, focusing on what's known in physics as the \" firewall paradox, \" which deals with a black hole's event horizon. That's an \" invisible boundary \" that prevents anything that crosses it from escaping, nature explains. The theory of general relativity suggests that an astronaut passing through an event horizon wouldn't even notice it. Quantum theory, however, says that an event horizon would be packed with energy — something an astronaut would definitely notice, since she'd be burned alive. The conflict is known as the \" firewall paradox, \" and hawking's new theory addresses it. The theory favors \" apparent horizons \" over event horizons. Apparent horizons hold matter and energy but later release them \" in a more garbled form, \" as nature puts it. Per hawking: \" the absence of event horizons means that there are no black holes — in the sense of regimes from which light can't escape to infinity. \"",

But when the call to redefine these cosmic crunchers comes from stephen hawking, it's worth taking notice. In a paper posted online, the physicist, based at the university of cambridge, uk, and one of the creators of modern black-hole theory, does away with the notion of an event horizon, the invisible boundary thought to shroud every black hole, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. Peter van den berg/photoshot \"there is no escape from a black hole in classical theory, but quantum theory enables energy and information to escape. \" in its stead, hawking's radical proposal is a much more benign \"apparent horizon \", which only temporarily holds matter and energy prisoner before eventually releasing them, albeit in a more garbled form. \"there is no escape from a black hole in classical theory, \" hawking told nature. Quantum theory, however, \"enables energy and information to escape from a black hole \". A full explanation of the process, the physicist admits, would require a theory that successfully merges gravity with the other fundamental forces of nature. But that is a",

Rather than getting sucked into a singularity of confusion, read our explainer what exactly is a black hole? good question. According to theoretical physicists, they used to be regions of space-time – the fabric that makes up the universe – that have become so dense that their huge gravity generates an event horizon, from inside which nothing, not even light, can escape. Then in 1974, hawking added quantum mechanics to the black hole picture and sparked a row that has raged on until the present day ( see timeline ).

            "Artist's impression victor habbick visions/spl/getty most physicists foolhardy enough to write a paper claiming that \"there are no black holes \" — at least not in the sense we usually imagine — would probably be dismissed as cranks. But when the call to redefine these cosmic crunchers comes from stephen hawking, it's worth taking notice. In a paper posted online, the physicist, based at the university of cambridge, uk, and one of the creators of modern black-hole theory, does away with the notion of an event horizon, the invisible boundary thought to shroud every black hole, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. Peter van den berg/photoshot \"there is no escape from a black hole in classical theory, but quantum theory enables energy and information to escape. \" in its stead, hawking's radical proposal is a much more benign \"apparent horizon \", which only temporarily holds matter and energy prisoner before eventually releasing them, albeit in a more garbled form. \"there is no escape from a black hole in classical theory, \" hawking told nature. Quantum theory, however, \"enables energy and information to escape from a black hole \". A full explanation of the process, the physicist admits, would require a theory that successfully merges gravity with the other fundamental forces of nature. But that is a",

Rather than getting sucked into a singularity of confusion, read our explainer what exactly is a black hole? good question. According to theoretical physicists, they used to be regions of space-time – the fabric that makes up the universe – that have become so dense that their huge gravity generates an event horizon, from inside which nothing, not even light, can escape. Then in 1974, hawking added quantum mechanics to the black hole picture and sparked a row that has raged on until the present day ( see timeline ).

Though the extent of the problem is still unknown, locals have been photographing oil and gas wells, chemical stores, and wastewater facilities all submerged in water, reports the colorado springs gazette. Many of the state's 50,000 oil and gas wells employ fracking, which utilizes toxic water, and anti-fracking activists have been particularly active in posting photos online of flooded wells and apparently leaking tanks, reports onearth. Indeed, the state's richest oil field is underwater. \" the scale is unprecedented, \" says the head of colorado's department of natural resources. \" you have 100, if not thousands, of wells underwater right now and we have no idea what those wells are leaking, \" one activist tells think progress. \" it's very clear they are leaking into the floodwaters though. \" other potential pollutants include open-air wastewater pits — also associated with fracking — and ruptured oil and gas pipelines. The state's health department has warned people to stay out of the water. \" many contaminants, such as raw sewage, as well as potential releases of chemicals from homes, businesses, and industry, may be contained in the floodwaters, \" says a spokesperson. \" people are encouraged to stay out of the water as much as possible. \"",
