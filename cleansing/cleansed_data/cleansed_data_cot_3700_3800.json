        "summary": "Randi zuckerberg, ceo of zuckerberg media and sister of mark, was flying from los angeles to mexico recently when she says the man seated next to her started rating the bodies of female passengers, talking to her about touching himself, and telling her \" millennial women just aren't willing to give some booty to get a job anymore, \" cnn reports. According to nbc news, zuckerberg says the man continued to make \" explicit, lewd, and highly offensive \" remarks to her for the rest of the alaska airlines flight. But when she complained to flight attendants, she says they \" told me he was a frequent flier, brushed off his behavior, and kept giving him drinks. \" zuckerberg says the best flight attendants could offer was to move her out of first class to a seat at the back of the plane. Zuckerberg says the whole experience left her feeling \" disgusted and degraded, \" bloomberg reports. And while alaska airlines has \" launched a thorough investigation \" into the male passenger and suspended his travel privileges, experts say this is far from an isolated incident. Sara nelson, international president of the association of flight attendants-cwa union, says sexual misconduct during flights is a \" silent epidemic. \" last year, a union survey found 20 % of crew members had been contacted by a passenger reporting sexual assault. But law enforcement was called or met the flight upon landing in fewer than half of those incidents. \" it is a critical time for the airline industry to examine the steps necessary to take this on, \" nelson says.",

Cherif kouachi, now 32, appears as a \" lanky young man \" who, according to the narrator, was happier to spend time with girls than at the mosque, reports ap. \" he appears relaxed and smiling as he pals around with friends, \" and at one point is shown rapping while wearing a backward baseball cap. About a year after it aired, he was arrested for trying to join fighters in iraq, though he was depicted during the trial as having fallen in with the wrong crowd. A former lawyer says the 18 months he spent in prison seemed to have hardened him. In 2011, charif traveled to yemen and underwent terrorist training with the al-qaeda affiliate there, reports the new york times. The training lasted a \" few months \" and covered small-arms combat and marksmanship. Less is known about his brother said, 34, though both men have been on the us no-fly list for years, reports nbc news. Us officials still don't know whether the brothers, who remain at large, acted on their own or received orders from an al-qaeda leader. A third suspect, mourad hamyd, 18, turned himself in after hearing his name on the news but says he had nothing to do with the murders.

Most of those people — 40.3 million — were displaced but still living within their own countries, per a new report by the un refugee agency. The rest had fled their native countries, with that figure broken down into 22.5 million refugees and 2.8 million people \" seeking asylum. \" of the total 65.6 million people displaced, 10.3 million of them became so in 2016. The statistics reflect dire situations in countries such as syria, which has been ravaged by a six-year civil war, and south sudan, which, the un report states, has suffered from a \"disastrous breakdown of peace efforts. \" the new york times reports that syria produced the most refugees last year, with 5.5 million, while nearly 750,000 fled south sudan. Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees ( 2.9 million ), with lebanon taking in the most displaced persons relative to the size of its population ( one in six ), reports thomson reuters. One glimmer of good news in the un report is that there has been a slowing in the growth of displacement worldwide. The number of people uprooted within their own countries was down slightly last year, as was the number of asylum seekers. Those numbers were offset, however, by an increase in the number of refugees to 22.5 million, the highest number reported since the united nations high commissioner for refugees office was formed in 1950.",

According to one hypothesis, the emergence of large, active organisms was restrained by the limited supply of large food particles such as algae. Through the discovery of molecular fossils of the photopigment chlorophyll in 1.1-billion-year-old marine sedimentary rocks, we were able to quantify the abundance of different phototrophs. The nitrogen isotopic values of the fossil pigments showed that the oceans were dominated by cyanobacteria, while larger planktonic algae were scarce. This supports the hypothesis that small cells at the base of the food chain limited the flow of energy to higher trophic levels, potentially retarding",

In that instant, \" i broke two of my most important marital promises, \" he writes. \" i started acting like my wife's doctor, and i lied to her. \" he did the latter because he knew the bad news immediately — her breast cancer had spread. He knew what was in store for her, even if she wouldn't for a little while longer, until her oncologist broke the news. Bach's essay recounts in eloquent fashion the next eight months leading up to ruth's death — the increasingly desperate treatments, the black humor, the moment when his wife had to tell their young son that the doctors couldn't make her better, his struggles to balance his roles as husband and doctor. He concludes with the observation that hollywood gets grief wrong. It's not, for instance, the big events like anniversaries that hit you. \" it's in the grocery aisle passing the romaine lettuce and recalling how your spouse learned to make caesar salad, with garlic-soaked croutons, because it was the only salad you'd agree to eat.... It's not sobbing, collapsing, moaning grief. It's phantom-limb pain. It aches, it throbs, there's nothing there, and yet you never want it to go away. \" the full essay is well worth the read.",

William mason — who was inside the bar and whose pickup also housed cash and firearms — and four others have been charged with the murder, and police are now investigating mason for possible involvement in the kidnapping of a man and his wife two months ago.

They only know that mason is only one of the names he goes by. He's known in guyana as rajesh ouellet and his nicknames include ted, teddy, rajesh, ramesh, danny, and raj; vice uncovered what seemed to be fake and abandoned medical companies attached to him. Some reports have him as being born in canada ( though officials there couldn't confirm to vice he was a citizen ), while breaking belize news reports that the man has claimed to be born in belize as well as guyana, and that he \" moves carefully and creatively, ensuring that police are unable to stop him. \" or perhaps not: the guardian belize alleges a smoking-gun video exists that shows a kidnapped lucas, along with two other victims who were later released, at mason's home in the capital city of belmopan on july 15.

Netanyahu is now scrambling to keep his job, but that will require winning the support of the newly-formed secularist yesh atid party, which defied predictions with its second-place finish. Yesh atid demands to resume palestinian peace talks and end military service exemptions for ultra-orthodox seminary students, a change strongly opposed by the religious parties in netanyahu's coalition, the bbc reports. President shimon peres is expected to give netanyahu the first shot at forming a new government. Netanyahu seems to be betting he ' ll succeed; he gave a victory speech last night in which he thanked israel for \" giving me another chance \" to be prime minister, the jerusalem post reports. \" we must form the broadest coalition possible, \" he said. \" i started working on this tonight. \" but yesh atid seems to have set the agenda for the new government, having firmly moved its \" equal share of the burden \" policy front and center, ynet news reports. The new york times has a full profile on yesh atid's founder, charismatic journalist yair lapid. Though little known in the us, lapid is a celebrity in israel. He built his platform around the middle class, building off 2011 populist social justice protests. The results represent a rebuke for netanyahu, and that's a good thing for president obama, observes peter beinart at the daily beast. Bibi will either have a small, unpopular coalition without lapid, or a quarrelsome one with him.",

In an earlier post, he said his house was flooded and he was at the \" complete mercy of the hurricane. \" the national hurricane center says maria, which hit dominica with winds of up to 160mph, was downgraded to a category 4 early tuesday before regaining strength as a category 5 again, reports reuters. The nhc says the storm will remain an \" extremely dangerous category 4 or 5 hurricane while it approaches the virgin islands and puerto rico. \" a state of emergency has been declared in puerto rico, where the storm is expected to hit wednesday, cnn reports. Gov. Ricardo rosselló tells usa today that if the storms hits as forecast, it \" will essentially devastate most of the island, \" causing far more damage than hurricane irma, which did not directly hit the island. Puerto ricans in flimsy homes \" have to evacuate. Otherwise, you're going to die, \" says hector pesquera, the island's public safety commissioner, per the ap. A state of emergency has also been declared in the us virgin islands, where maria will be closest to st. Croix, the island that suffered the least damage from irma.",

First, the six elements as laid out by ohio state university researchers are: expressing regret explaining what went wrong acknowledging responsibility declaring repentance offering to repair asking forgiveness if you've got the time ( and lack of ego ) to squeeze in all six, the greater your chances of being forgiven, according to several hundred adults and undergrads asked to evaluate a hypothetical apology, reports the telegraph. If you have to leave out one element, asking to be forgiven is the one to go. But owning up to your misstep and offering to fix it are by far the most effective of the remaining five. \" our findings showed that the most important component is an acknowledgement of responsibility — say it is your fault, that you made a mistake, \" the lead researcher says. But that's not all. \" one concern about apologies is that talk is cheap. But by saying, ' i ' ll fix what is wrong, ' you're committing to take action to undo the damage. \" ( check how these top five political apologies stack up. )",

Compared to white women, african-american women noted a significantly smaller decline, while women of japanese descent noted a much greater decline. \" this study highlights the need for health-care providers to have open conversations with their patients about their sexual issues, because there are many options for women to help maintain or improve their sexual lives as they transition to and beyond menopause, \" one expert tells healthday.

Morgan stanley and the other underwriters have made an estimated $ 100 million from stabilizing the buffeted stock, in addition to their regular ipo fees, reports the wall street journal. Underwriters typically oversell an ipo by 15 % in order to help them stabilize the price — they reportedly bought up some of those extra shares twice on friday to prevent the shares turning into a loss. But on monday, the facebook share price fell below the ipo opening value, allowing the underwriters to buy shares at the new, lower price and pocket the difference, which worked out to about $ 100 million. Of course, if you missed the memo that the facebook ipo price was overvalued, you are not alone. Since reports surfaced that facebook's underwriters told only a select group of large investors that the social media giant was overpriced, the journal has dug up the names of some of those lucky insiders, including capital research &amp; management and fidelity investments. The \" lackluster \" facebook deal \" has illustrated that pockets of the financial world remain firmly stacked in favor of the market's biggest players, \" according to the journal's analysis.",

            "Geneva ( 22 september 2015 ) – a group of united nations human rights experts* today urged the government of saudi arabia to halt the execution of ali mohammed al-nimr, who was convicted for a crime reportedly committed as a child. He may be executed at any time. \"saudi arabia may so far this year have executed at least 134 people, which already represents 44 more than the total for the whole of last year, \" they noted. \"such a surge in executions in the country makes saudi arabia a sad exception in a world where states are increasingly moving away from the death penalty. \" ali mohammed al-nimr, a high school student, was arrested in 2012",
            "Dubai ( afp ) - the father of a shiite youth facing execution for taking part in pro-reform protests appealed to saudi arabia's king salman on wednesday to spare his life. The sentence against ali al-nimr, only 17 when he was arrested in february 2012, has drawn international condemnation over his young age at the time and allegations that he was tortured into making a confession. It is the latest case to highlight use of the death penalty and human rights in the islamic kingdom, which amnesty international says is one of the world's most prolific executioners. In an interview with afp, mohammed al-nimr said he hoped the king would save his son."

It's something of a tale: per the kansas city star, the 80-year-old is accused of shooting and killing attorney tom pickert a week after pickert won a $ 5.75 million judgment against jungerman in october 2017. Jungerman had been accused of shooting pickert's client, a homeless man jungerman said was trying to steal copper from his business. Jungerman was also accused of shooting three others for the same reason within the same month's time in 2012, though he claimed self-defense and wasn't charged. In march, jungerman was charged with shooting at yet another man, who he said was trying to steal metal pipes from his company. Pickert's family has now filed a wrongful death lawsuit against jungerman, and a jackson county judge has placed his $ 33 million in assets under the care of attorney leland shurin, who sits on the kansas city board of police commissioners. Jungerman's attorney, nicole forsythe, calls that \" as un-american as you can get, \" per the star. Forsythe argues shurin's post is a conflict of interest, but shurin says he works solely in a legal capacity and had nothing to do with charging or investigating jungerman. The star notes shurin's duties on the board do include overseeing police department operations, including personnel matters. The paper also reports that while the $ 5.75 million judgment against him was in the works, jungerman allegedly tried to move assets around, including transferring property into his daughter's name, as well as making bank withdrawals and transfers worth $ 10 million or so.",

Full details of the new diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders — known as dsm — will emerge in may, but time reports on the biggest changes: asperger's syndrome will lose its independent status and become part of the autistic spectrum. The controversy: asperger's is less severe than autism, and parents fear the loss of diagnosis will mean children with asperger's won't qualify for special services, reports cbs. Binge-eating disorder will be labeled a full-blown illness. This will create a new market for professionals to treat the ailment and receive insurance reimbursement. It also raises the question of whether downing a pint of haagen-dazs is a sign of depression or a distinct disorder. Bereavement can be considered depression. Skeptics have long complained that the apa's definition of depression is too expansive; now psychiatrists will be allowed to consider grief over a lost loved one as a form of depression. Children who frequently flip out may have dmdd — disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Critics say it's only normal for kids to have outbursts, but the apa contends that dmdd will help avoid over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children. Not in the new dsm: sex addiction. Many apa members wanted it, but \" there evidence just wasn't there, \" says an apa board member. Click for two more dsm additions: skin-picking disorder and hoarding.",

The guardian spotlights a most unusual prosthetics market that's seemingly been supplied by one woman for two decades: japanese gangsters looking to leave the yakuza, but marked by self-amputation. A vice news article on the topic explains that yubitsume, or finger-shortening, is a centuries-old practice the yakuza adopted as a way for members to atone for breaching the honor code. Those who do will slice off the portion of their left pinkie above the top joint, and it's apparently common practice: a 1993 governmental survey found 45 % of modern-day yakuza members have a severed finger joint. Enter yukako fukushima. As an employee of prosthetics company kawamura gishi, fukushima makes the digits, complete with fingerprints, from silicone and a blend of red, blue, yellow, and brown paint. Kyodo reports the 44-year-old can spin some 1,800 skin colors out of the hues, and that when worn, \" it is hard to see where the artificial pinkie begins. \" and its presence helps the former yakuza members achieve things that otherwise might be out of reach, like a job or wife. But in order to produce one, fukushima first needs proof said member is out, which kyodo reports she gains in part by having an osaka prefectural police officer interview the would-be buyer. The tips last up to a decade, reports the guardian, which talks to fukushima about why she's been at the job even longer. \" i was about to look for another job when someone told me that i was the only person in japan doing this kind of work. \"",

Everything hurts from my head down to my toes. \" in a youtube video she created earlier this year, she said she is 5 ' 7 \" and \" 40-some \" pounds, and farrokh and husband rod edmondson now outline her many health issues: she can no longer walk on her own; she speaks slowly and loses her train of thought; she has osteoporosis; she's experienced heart, liver, and kidney failure. She's been in treatment before, but currently doesn't reach the minimum weight that most facilities require, she says. As two eating disorder doctors explain, the \" refeeding \" process can be life-threatening if calories are increased too quickly, and most hospitals aren't equipped to do it safely. But farrokh and edmondson, who quit his job to act as her primary caretaker, have so far raised nearly $ 180,000 on gofundme for medical expenses, and because of that cnn reports that she will be able to begin treatment. \" there is only one hospital in the country that specializes in refeeding patients at such a low body weight and it's my mission to get her there, \" the gofundme page explains. That would be the acute center for eating disorders at the denver health medical center. But the california woman says she's currently too weak to travel there, so the plan is for the treatment to be brought to her at first — she ' ll see her calories increased by as little as 25 each day — until it's safe for her to travel. As for her struggle with the disease, farrokh — whose husband says she has always been \" a perfectionist \" — attributes it to \" the perfect storm \" of losing her job while \" also going through trauma from my past.... I just felt out of control, \" she says. ( strangers at a gym intervened to save an anorexic woman's life. )",

The girl, now 4, tested positive last week and is back on antiretroviral drugs. The case made international headlines last year: after the baby was born to a mother with hiv, doctors put her on aggressive drug treatment just 30 hours after birth. The mother, however, stopped giving her daughter the drugs at 18 months. The baby missed several months of treatment, and when doctors finally saw her again, they were stunned to discover that she had barely detectable levels of hiv. In effect, she was \" functionally cured, \" recounts cnn. That remained the case until last week. \"it felt very much like a punch to the gut, \" says dr. Hannah b. Gay, who treats the girl. \"it was disappointing from the scientific standpoint because we had been hopeful it would lead to bigger and better things, but mainly for the sake of the child who is back on medicine and expected to remain on medicine for a very long time. \" hiv hides in reservoirs of the body, and antiretroviral drugs keep it in check there, explains the boston globe. Its reemergence in this case shows that doctors have much to learn about those reservoirs, says anthony fauci, chief of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases.

        "summary": "Next time you're annoyed by a tenacious mosquito, you can take solace in the fact that it, too, has to deal with parasites who want to suck its blood. And, as jennifer frazer points out in scientific american, the mosquito has no way of slapping the tiny creature known as a culicoid midge. And while a mosquito bite doesn't last too long, the flying midges have been known to lock onto mosquitoes for days at a time: one bit its host for 56 hours. \" the midge's mouthparts seem designed to keep it securely harpooned to their new bestest friend whether they're feeding, flying, or silently cursing evolution's ironies, \" writes frazer. As many as three have been seen on one host, reports parasite of the day. Worse yet: scaled to human size, they're about the size of a dinner plate. The midges were noted in 1922, but they haven't been studied much since then. Recently, however, some chinese scientists caught one and filmed it, apparently through a microscope; viewers can see the creature hang onto a mosquito for three minutes before letting go. They live in a vast area including india, china, and southeast asia, frazer notes. But just because they torment our tormentors doesn't mean they're good news for humans. The midges also bite cattle directly, and they can carry a number of viruses, as can the mosquitoes they bite.

What made the midge was remarkable was the thing it bit: mosquitoes. Yet in the years since, relatively little work has been done on these potentially important blood-sucking midges, even though their geographic range encompasses the mosquito hotbeds of india, china, and southeast asia. Recently, however, a team of scientists in china managed to capture one of them on film. Using a tasty cow as bait, the chinese scientists trapped mosquitoes and took them back to the laboratory. Among their catch was a single mosquito with a midge clinging tenaciously to its backside. The next day, they repeated the procedure and again netted a midge-bearing skeeter. This time they chloroformed the pair \"lightly \" and placed them under a dissecting microscope and appear to have recorded a video by sticking a camera up to the lens. After about three minutes, the midge decided it had had enough and attempted to de-deploy — with somewhat comical results — at about 1: 30. In order to uncork itself, it has to do a 180 and pull like hell, bracing itself against its victim for leverage. After nearly a minute of struggle, it finally pops free.

The 22-year-old shiffrin finished fourth in the women's olympic slalom on friday, failing to win her second medal in as many days. She won gold in the giant slalom on thursday. The fourth-place showing on friday was a surprise considering the american standout won the olympic slalom title four years ago in sochi when she was only 18. Shiffrin struggled to describe what happened and why she wasn't attacking the course more. \" i've been skiing aggressively in slalom all season long. I've been confident, comfortable, \" shiffrin said. \" coming here and skiing the way i did, really conservative, was a huge disappointment.... That's how life goes. \" frida hansdotter of sweden won gold with a combined time of 1 minute, 38.63 seconds. In figure skating, chen was anything but spot-on in the men's figure skating short program. The two-time u.s.

        "summary": "A convoluted cold case that has fascinated france for decades may have taken a big step toward resolution. Authorities say three family members have been detained for questioning in the 32-year-old murder of 4-year-old gregory villemin. Gregory's body was found tied up in the vologne river in eastern france in october of 1984, and from the start, the case was full of twists. Hours before gregory was found dead, the boy's uncle said he'd received a call from a person claiming to be his kidnapper, reports the bbc. A day later, gregory's parents said they received a letter reading, \" your son is dead, i have been avenged. \" a month after that, bernard laroche, a cousin of gregory's dad, was arrested when his sister-in-law told police she'd seen lorache with gregory on the banks of the vologne, reports le parisien. When the 15-year-old retracted her statement months later, laroche was released. But gregory's father, jean-marie villemin, then killed laroche. While villemin was in jail, his wife, christine villemin, was imprisoned for gregory's killing after cords similar to those used to tie him up were found in the family home, but she, too, was later cleared, per the local in a 2013 story. On wednesday, however, authorities announced they'd detained three people on suspicion of complicity in the murder, failing to report a crime, and failing to helping a person at risk. All three are members of the villemin family, per le parisien and le monde. The bbc describes them only as a couple in their 70s, along with a woman. Gregory's grandmother was reportedly brought in as a witness. ( this 47-year-old cold case may be solved. )",

For example, the guideline makers used data from studies in the 1990s to determine how various risk factors like cholesterol levels and blood pressure led to actual heart attacks and strokes over a decade of observation.

        "summary": "A tiny california town that the new york times calls \" more necropolis than metropolis \" isn't far from where the super bowl will be played in the san francisco bay area on sunday. But any traffic in colma ( aka \" the city of souls \" ) over the weekend is more likely to be from a funeral procession. The town boasts 1.5 million dead residents — and about 1,600 living ones — in 17 graveyards across 2 square miles or so, supplemented by a significant number of florists, per kqed. Why such an abundance? mainly because being in san francisco is just as exorbitant for the erstwhile as it is for the alive and kicking. Burials were halted in san francisco in 1900 for a number of reasons, the main one being that cemeteries \" sat on prime real estate, \" as the times puts it. Cemeteries fell into disrepair and became vandalism targets after the ban. \" entire skeletons were carried away to be used as halloween decorations, \" and skulls were reportedly used for soccer games, a local historian tells kqed. So the city went even further in 1912: it uprooted 150,000 already-buried bodies and moved them to colma graveyards. Some of the disinterred were put back into private plots in colma if their families ponied up a small fee; others were simply placed in mass graves, including one that reportedly holds nearly 40,000 catholics at the holy cross cemetery. \" we are are the city of souls, but we are really protecting the cemeteries, \" the town's vice mayor says. \" there is an emotional attachment to them. \" ( moscow cemeteries are going high-tech. )",

            "Colma, calif. — while the super bowl will be played at levi's stadium, and thousands of news media members who descended on the bay area this week were based at the moscone center, levi strauss lay inside a marble crypt in one of this tiny town's 17 cemeteries, and george moscone lay under the grass in another. In a broad valley devoted largely to the dead, the history museum in colma — nicknamed the city of souls — sells t-shirts that read, \"it's great to be alive in colma! \" it is a town of 1,600 living residents and about 1.5 million dead ones — many of whom, like the 49ers, uprooted and left san francisco for greener pastures to the south. The road to sunday's super bowl stretches about 50 miles, from san francisco, the epicenter of festivities this week, to santa clara, site of the actual game. The corridor, mostly along highway 101, is a time capsule of the bay area's history and its quirks — and a modern-day testament to its traffic problems."

Speculation swirled in the immediate aftermath, fueled in part by videos that sprung up on social media. But the cook county medical examiner's office determined she succumbed to hypothermia as evidenced in part by a type of lesion called mucosal erosions that is tied to the condition, reports the chicago tribune. Her blood alcohol level was 0.112, and she had also consumed caffeine and topiramate, a drug used to treat epilepsy and migraines. Her family said the latter was not a drug she had been prescribed. The medical examiner specifically tested for date-rape drugs and found none in the 19-year-old's system. She did have a bruise on her right leg, but there were no significant signs of trauma or any indication of assault. Per the report, the alcohol and topiramate could have caused \" poor coordination, confusion, and impaired judgement \"; it noted that \" central nervous system depression combined with cold exposure can hasten the onset of hypothermia and death. \" the tribune reports the freezer jenkins was found in at the crowne plaza in rosemont was in an unused kitchen that had its cooking appliances removed but for \" an unknown reason \" had an operational but empty freezer. There was a circular release mechanism on the door inside the freezer, but the light was not on when jenkins was found.",

The 19-year old was found inside the freezer on sept. 10 after she disappeared from a room at the crowne plaza in suburban rosemont. She had attended a party with as many as 30 other people on the ninth floor and wasn't found until nearly 24 hours after her disappearance, after repeated pleas to the hotel and police by the family.

The initial lack of information released by authorities drew activists and sparked online conspiracy theories that she was attacked and killed.

Almost 90 % of the 2,689 inmates in the state's largest prison are serving time for violent crimes. Fights and racial tension are common, inmates say, and while there hasn't been an escape from the maximum-security part of the prison since it opened in 1845, at least 23 inmates committed suicide between 2000 and 2014. In other developments: federal arrest warrants have been issued for sweat and matt, which clears the way for federal resources to be used in the search, cnn reports. Law enforcement officials say they're following up 150 leads. Gov. Andrew cuomo — who says the taunting note the men left will be returned to them when they're recaptured — has offered a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to their arrest, or $ 50,000 for either of them, reports the new york daily news. Cuomo says the men, last seen during a friday night count, could \" be anywhere in the state \" by now, or across the border in canada, which is about 20 miles north of the prison, the wall street journal reports. Sweat, reported to be 34 or 35 in various media, killed a sheriff's deputy in 2002, but matt, 48 or 49, may be the more dangerous of the pair. He kidnapped, murdered, and dismembered his former boss in 1997, and officers who worked on his case tell the new york times that he is the most vicious, evil, and cunning criminal they have ever encountered. \" i've seen him inflict wounds on himself, cut himself; break his collarbone and not seek any treatment, \" a retired city of tonawanda detective says. \" he's just totally, totally fearless, and doesn't respond to pain. \"",

The police department was not able to release further information as of press time, partially because most of the city government was closed monday in observation of columbus day, leaving officials including chief tom pyle and capt. Ralph harvey unavailable. As of monday evening, officials from apd had not contacted ohio university's office of community standards and student responsibility, a branch of ou's division of student affairs, said martha compton, the office's director. Compton couldn't confirm nor deny whether ou students were involved in the incident.

The police department was not able to release further information as of press time, partially because most of the city government was closed monday in observation of columbus day, leaving officials including chief tom pyle and capt. Ralph harvey unavailable. As of monday evening, officials from apd had not contacted ohio university's office of community standards and student responsibility, a branch of ou's division of student affairs, said martha compton, the office's director.

On wednesday, during the texas department of health services'second public hearing on the proposed rules, women came forward to share their stories of miscarriages or abortions and to tell officials that putting the rules into effect would make an already painful experience much worse. Officials say they're trying to ensure all fetal remains are put to rest in a \" dignified \" fashion, but opponents say the proposal is just another way to restrict access to abortion in the state, courthouse news reports. Officials have also said the rules would protect the public from communicable diseases, the austin american-statesman reports. There are potential privacy concerns — it's not clear how the rules would be implemented, such as whether a death certificate will be required to inter fetal remains — as well as concerns about costs. The funeral consumers alliance of texas estimates $ 2,000 could be added to the cost of each abortion, per the austin chronicle. \" you're monkeying around with people's lives here, \" said a tearful ashley blinkhorn, who testified about having two miscarriages. The rules would affect \" so many people in so many ways that people aren't considering. \" the department of health services could make changes to the proposed rules based on public comments. At that point, they would need to be approved by the health and human services commission executive commissioner and posted in the texas register 20 days before taking effect.",

In the case of the european particle physics organization, that means considering an even bigger collider — one housed in a tunnel 62 miles long. Four times the size of the lhc, the new collider could surround geneva, though it might be built elsewhere, the bbc reports. Like its predecessor, the new system could smash protons together. Researchers are looking to conduct experiments at energies eight times higher than those achieved in the lhc. Another option would be colliding electrons, whose activities are easier to read, the bbc explains.

The kansas city star reports on the 39-year-old's indictment for second-degree murder, almost seven months after his 20-year-old son dominick j. Pittsenbarger passed away. Per the new york post, the clay county jury that handed down the indictment tuesday believes injuries from the february 1998 attack on baby dominick — in which tannery is said to have squeezed, shaken, and thrown the month-old infant to the ground in an effort to stop his crying — ultimately led to dominick's death in april. Doctors didn't initially think the baby would survive the attack, but he did, although he was left with broken ribs, a fractured vertebra, bleeding on the brain, and other head injuries. He was left severely brain damaged and used a wheelchair for his entire life. Tannery pleaded guilty to a first-degree assault charge in 1999 and was sentenced to 13 years in prison; he was released in 2007. Meanwhile, pittsenbarger, who graduated from high school in 2017, was adopted by his mom's husband, wendell pittsenbarger, and spent his time watching sesame street, shooting baskets, and hanging out with friends; his mother died before he did. \" i love that boy and still miss him dearly, \" wendell pittsenbarger tells the star. \" i think about him all of the time. \" tannery, due in court friday, is being held on a $ 500,000 bond.

The \" designer coffee and tea alarm clock \" will gently rouse you from your slumber with the sounds and aroma of coffee ( or loose-leaf tea ) being brewed, reports eater. The goal of the gadget is to \" stimulate the senses, leading to awakening, \" designer joshua renouf says, per trusted reviews. But it's not on the market yet. A kickstarter campaign to fund the production of the barisieur had, as of this writing, raised more than $ 230,000 toward a $ 500,000 goal. The concept ( a \" pet project \" for renouf ) has been around since at least 2014, engadget reports. And, if all goes well ( the crowdfunding campaign still has 23 days to go ), the coffeemaker will ship next year. Eater likens the barisieur to another sensory alarm clock that uses the aromas of coffee, bacon, or even cash to stir users. But where that unit may leave you uncaffeinated, the barisieur actually delivers … a cup of coffee. Here are the specs: an induction hob heats the water to 94 degrees. There's a reusable steel mesh filter. A storage tank keeps milk cool overnight. There's storage for sugar and other condiments. There's a usb port for phone charging. According to the makers, even prepping the barisieur each night carries a benefit: \" it encourages a ritual in order to establish a routine before going to sleep, signaling to the body and mind that it is time to unwind and relax. \" but eater warns users to \" try not to spill boiling-hot coffee all over themselves when they absent-mindedly hit the snooze button. \" ( this alarm-clock app gathered stats on 1 million users; here's what it found. )",

Isis has been known to use drones of the kind easily bought online for surveillance, but this is thought to be among the first times the group has successfully used them to attack its enemies. \" we should have been ready for this, and we weren't, \" a robotic weaponry expert at the new america think tank tells the new york times.

The pentagon is working on ways to combat attacks from small drones and has developed devices to disarm them, though these are not generally available to iraqi or kurdish fighters on the front lines.

        "summary": "What was predicted has come to pass: a major earthquake hit a remote mountainous region of nepal today, killing at least 36 people and injuring another 1,117, triggering landslides, and toppling buildings less than three weeks after the country was ravaged by its worst quake in decades. Information was slow to reach the capital of kathmandu, but officials and aid workers say they expect the death toll will almost certainly rise. Rescue helicopters were sent to districts northeast of the capital of kathmandu, where landslides and buildings collapsed by the magnitude-7.3 quake may have left people buried; a government official named the sindhupalchowk and dolkha districts as the hardest hit. Today's quake was deeper than the 7.8-magnitude quake that rocked the country on april 25, coming from a depth of 11.5 miles versus the earlier one at 9.3 miles. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage. The guardian explains by way of a british seismologist that in terms of the \" amplitude \" of the quake ( meaning \" the distance the ground moves \" ), the 7.8-magnitude quake was about five times more powerful than today's. As for today's quake, it was followed closely by at least six strong aftershocks, according to the us geological survey. At least four people were killed in sindhulpalchowk's town of chautara, according to a rep with the international organization for migration; that's the town where nasa managed to help find four survivors after the april 25 temblor.",
