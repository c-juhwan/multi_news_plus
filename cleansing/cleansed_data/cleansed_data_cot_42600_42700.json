Officials are asking theodore wafer, 54, to turn himself in, and they expect to arraign him today, the detroit free press reports. \" we do not believe he acted in lawful self defense, \" worthy said, explaining that such a claim requires a reasonable belief of imminent death or grave bodily harm. Worthy said there were no signs that renisha mcbride tried to force her way into wafer's home. According to prosecutors, she knocked on a locked front screen door. Wafer then allegedly opened the inner door, and shot her through the screen door. A toxicology report released yesterday indicates that mcbride was drunk at the time, with a blood alcohol level of.218, and that there's a \" strong possibility \" she had marijuana in her system, cbs reports. A lawyer for her family says that shouldn't matter, and that wafer should have called 911. \" maybe she would have been arrested because she was drunk — but she'd be alive. \"",

Science reports that though cousins of the tyrannosaurus rex likely sported feathers, a new study examining skin fossils of the t. Rex suggests the king of beasts had scaly skin. The paper, published in the journal biology letters, details the findings of scientists who studied the fossilized skin of a t. Rex named wyrex, which has been stored in the houston museum of natural science since 2006. Samples from the neck, pelvis, chest, abdomen, and tail of wyrex and other tyrannosaurid dinosaurs ( albertosaurus, daspletosaurus, gorgosaurus and tarbosaurus ) indicated scaly skin, not feathers. \" with all the hype about feathered theropods, it's easy to forget that actually most dinosaurs had scaly, reptilian-like skin, \" study author phil r. Bell tells the washington post. If t. Rex did have feathers, the study says they'd be isolated to the dino's back and spine, areas that were not examined since no known samples exist. Fossilized skin samples of the t. Rex are rare because the methods paleontologists previously favored to get to the dinosaur's bones involved a lot of smashing, reports the post. The study suggests that since t. Rex's earlier relatives had feathers, the dinosaur likely lost them for evolutionary reasons. \" big animals have trouble shedding excess heat, \" bell says, \" so being covered in feathers is not a good idea unless you live somewhere cold. \" ( feathered or not, dinos apparently danced. )",

Also believed to be in custody, per ahram: a woman who's said to have known the couple online and helped bring together the two with the camel driver. Hvid has since spoken with a danish newspaper and says this was his third try at climbing the pyramid — and first successful attempt, in just 25 minutes — though he stresses that he and the woman didn't engage in any sexual activity while they were up there. He says they simply posed for a risque photo. Hvid also says he wasn't trying to insult or offend anyone, and he adds that because of the outrage, he won't be returning to egypt anytime soon for fear of being arrested himself.

        "summary": "Private thomas hurdis'death in october 1917 was a grisly one. The australian soldier was shot in the face with lead bullets during the battle of passchendaele in france, blinding the 27-year-old and destroying parts of his jaw and sinuses. Philadelphia ophthalmologist wt shoemaker tended to the soldier, who bled to death five days after sustaining the injuries after he tore out the bandages that were packed into his cheek. His body was interred in a military cemetery in le tréport, france; his skull wasn't, until now. The guardian reports the skull had for nearly a century been in the possession of the mutter museum of the college of physicians of philadelphia, which says the british government donated it two years after hurdis'death \" for study by military doctors conducting reconstructive surgery on soldiers. \" while australia acknowledged the museum obtained the skull in a manner \" entirely consistent with the applicable laws and protocols, \" it requested that it be repatriated, and the museum announced tuesday it will oblige. Philly.com reports us and british armies have permitted skulls of dead soldiers to be used for medical education so long as the soldier wasn't identified. But once the guardian in late september raised the question of the soldier's identity, a british military forum used details regarding the location, timing, and position of the soldier's wounds to conclude the skull likely belonged to hurdis. The ap reports the museum was founded in 1863 and displays such oddities as the body of a woman \" who essentially turned to soap \" and a tumor removed from president grover cleveland. ( the remains of 23 wwi soldiers may be slumbering here. )",

And the reason why is something the grocery chain has been in trouble for before: overcharging customers based on overstated weights, reports the consumerist. And today, the company's co-ceos put out a video apology — filmed in the store's sliced-fruit section, cnn notes — admitting to the overcharging. \" straight up, we made some mistakes, \" walter robb says in the video. \" we wanna own that and tell you what we're doing about it. \" those \" mistakes \" were released in a report last week by nyc's department of consumer affairs, which revealed that tests on 80 different types of prepackaged products at the stores showed all of them were marked with the wrong weight and, therefore, the wrong price; overcharges ranged from $ 0.80 for the panko to $ 14.84 for a container of coconut shrimp. The probe suggests that packages are either inaccurately weighed or not ever weighed — the department's press release notes that different packages consistently weighing the same amount should serve as a warning sign that's happening. But john mackey weighs in in the video, saying \" a very, very small percentage \" of foods such as freshly prepared sandwiches and juices were affected by the misweighing; robb adds the errors were \" unintentional because the mistakes are both in the customers ' favor and sometimes not in the customers ' favor. \" either way, they're pledging to boost employee training and put an independent auditing system in place, with progress reports to start in a little over a month.

But the circumstances surrounding the murder trial of david dearlove in england are drawing even more attention. The alleged murder of 19-month-old paul booth took place in 1968, and the witness who has come forward to police was just 3 years old at the time, reports the telegraph. That witness is the victim's brother, peter booth, who came forward after a relative posted a faded family photo on facebook of dearlove, now 71, and paul booth, taken just weeks before the boy's death. The photo angered peter booth, who confided in a cousin about what he had seen on the night of the boy's death nearly 50 years ago. She went to police, and the subsequent investigation has led to the trial now underway. Peter booth told the court that he snuck down from his room the night of oct. 1, 1968, to get a drink and saw dearlove deliberately swing paul booth by his ankles into the fireplace, head-first. He said he fled back to his room in fear, because dearlove was regularly abusive, and kept what he saw a secret. Dearlove and the boys ' now-deceased mother told police that the boy's fractured skull came after he fell out of bed, and no charges were filed, reports gazettelive. Peter booth had twice before gone to police as an adult to request an investigation, to no avail, but he never shared the details of the incident until now, per the washington post. Experts including a neurosurgeon have testified that it's unlikely that the blunt-force trauma suffered by the young victim came from a tumble out of bed.",

A young sei whale — a member of an endangered species — was found in a chesapeake bay tributary, seeming confused. Within days, it was found dead: it had been unable to eat after swallowing a sharp piece of a dvd case, which ripped its stomach. Already weak, it was also wounded by a collision with a ship, the national geographic reports. \" it was a very long and painful decline, \" says a researcher, noting that the whale probably ingested the case during surface feeding. The incident is not an isolated one. Some 56 % of cetacean species have been found to have consumed debris, a study last year found, and scientists offer all kinds of disturbing stories. One describes a dead sperm whale with 400 pounds of debris in its belly. A dead gray whale had 20 plastic bags, surgical gloves, towels, a golf ball, and even a pair of sweatpants inside it. Seabirds and sea turtles are among other animals suffering. \" we often find cigarette lighters, bucket handles, toothbrushes, syringes, toy soldiers — anything made out of plastic, \" a researcher told the los angeles times in 2006.

        "summary": "It is, in the words of wired, a \" rodent mind meld. \" a duke neuroscientist planted electrodes in the brains of two rats and discovered that signals from one could control the actions of the other, reports the new york times. In one experiment, the rats were trained to press a specific lever upon seeing a red light in order to get a drink of water as reward. The first rat saw the light and pressed the correct lever. The second rat wasn't shown the light but pressed the correct lever anyway, most of the time, after receiving the signals from the first rat's brain. What's more, the rats got their reward only if both rodents responded correctly. Researchers say the first rat apparently figured this out and started sending clearer signals to his pal, which boosted the success rate even more. Ultimately, duke's miguel nicolelis hopes his work leads to an exoskeleton that can be controlled by a paralyzed person. On this particular experiment, however, reuters quotes an anonymous neuroscientist a little leery about the precedent, fearful of a slippery slope worthy of a sci-fi blockbuster. He sees the possibility of \" battalions of animal soldiers — or even human soldiers — whose brains are remotely controlled by others. \"",

According to a new study, black widows and house spiders have comparable toxic compounds in their venom — but black widows evolved faster and became far more dangerous. The common compounds are called latrotoxins; the black widow, however, produces alpha-latrotoxin, which takes over an unlucky victim's nervous system. \" if you got bitten by a black widow, \" says study co-author jessica garb, \" alpha-latrotoxin would travel to the pre-synaptic regions of your neurons... And it inserts itself into the membrane. \" \" this causes all of the neuron's vesicles to dump out their neurotransmitters, \" she adds. \" and that's really what's painful. \" put another way, alpha-latrotoxin makes nerve cells unleash all of their chemical signals together, swamping the nervous system and inflicting massive pain, phys.org reports. The study, presented at the society of integrative and comparative biology, also says black widows may have evolved to spin stronger webs that can hold larger victims like reptiles and small mammals. Researchers add that black-widow venom holds extra chemicals that help its neurotoxins hit targets in the human system — so scientists are \" only just beginning to appreciate the complexity and evolution of spider venom, \" says phys.org.

Usually they're only witnessed dead after washing up on a beach or sick and swimming near the shore.

        "summary": "The tribes of the great sioux nation are scrambling to raise enough funds to buy back sacred land seized from them by congress 135 years ago. The 2,000-acre site, known as pe'sla, is located in the black hills of south dakota and is going up for auction this week. The property has been owned since 1877 by a local family, who has allowed the sioux to perform healing ceremonies there, reports nbc. But now members of the reynolds family have divided the property into five parcels to be auctioned off. The lakota, dakota, and nakota tribes are desperately trying to raise $ 1 million on the internet, but time is running out, and they only had $ 156,000 yesterday. The property has been assessed by the county at $ 342,000, but word is out that the parcels could go for as high as $ 10 million. \"there's no telling what's going to happen, what sort of development is going to come along, \" said chase iron eyes, a member of the standing rock and oglala tribes. The sioux believe they were created at the black hills site, notes ap. According to their creation belief, the morning star fell to earth there, killing seven women whose souls formed the \" seven sisters, \" or pleiades constellation. Congress broke a treaty and passed a law seizing the land from the sioux in 1877 after gold was found in western dakota. A court ordered the federal government in 1980 to pay the sioux $ 102 million for the land, but they have refused to take the money, which is now worth close to $ 1 billion, reports the atlantic. The sioux are reluctant to use the money to buy the up-for-auction land, fearing that would imply the land seizure was legitimate to begin with.",

What she learned: drinking water: it's from a municipal source, it's safe, and it has no added ingredients beyond what you need ( like fluoride ). Distilled water: a filtration process has removed both contaminants and natural minerals from purified water. It's best for hand-held appliances like steam irons, which won't build up minerals. But the lack of healthy minerals is a negative if you want drinking water. Purified water: it's been stripped of chemicals and contaminants, but like distilled water, that comes with pluses and minuses. Spring water: despite the label, it may be more \" glorified tap water \" than natural aqua from \" a tall snow-capped mountain, \" writes kirschner. Some studies found it can even contain contaminants like arsenic and coliform. So kirschner ultimately picked drinking water, because that's what it's meant for: drinking. But in case that solution makes you nervous, you can confirm the quality of your local tap water at the epa's website. Or you can look up the quality of your preferred bottled water at the environmental working group's site.",

        "summary": "Apple users are no longer immune to the \" ransomware \" that has attacked pc users in recent years, locking their files or freezing their computers and demanding payment. Security researchers say a tainted version of a torrenting program called transmission appears to have spread the \" keranger \" malware to mac users over the weekend. \" this is the first one in the wild that is definitely functional, encrypts your files, and seeks a ransom, \" the threat intelligence director at palo alto networks tells reuters. Researchers say that keranger is silent for the first few days that a computer is infected and then encrypts files, demanding one bitcoin — around $ 400 — to retrieve them, cnet reports. Palo alto networks, which first spotted the problem, says on its website that users who downloaded the transmission installer from the official website between 11: 00am pst on march 4 and 7: 00pm pst on march 5 are definitely at risk of keranger infection, while those who downloaded the program earlier from third-party websites may also be at risk. The group notes that keranger appears to be a work still in progress, with functions still under development, including the capacity to stop victims from using time machine to recover files attacked by the malware. ( a hollywood hospital coughed up $ 17,000 when its systems were infected by ransomware. )",

            "( reuters ) - the first known ransomware attack on apple inc's ( aapl.o ) mac computers, which was discovered over the weekend, was downloaded more than 6,000 times before the threat was contained, according to a developer whose product was tainted with the malicious software. Hackers infected macs with the \"keranger \" ransomware through a tainted copy of transmission, a popular program for transferring data through the bittorrent peer-to-peer file sharing network. So-called ransomware is a type of malicious software that restricts access to a computer system in some way and demands the user pay a ransom to the malware operators to remove the restriction. Keranger, which locks data on macs so users cannot access it, was downloaded about 6,500 times before apple and developers were able to thwart the threat, said john clay, a representative for the open-source transmission project. That is small compared to the number of ransomware attacks",

Ibm will today announce a plan to make a more powerful version of its famous watson supercomputer available online at a sliver of what access to the system has cost, the new york times reports. Of course, the goal isn't really to help you hustle the guys at jim's pub, or give ken jennings a nervous twitch. Jeopardy is just a hobby for watson, a powerful learning system with applications ranging from medicine to computational linguistics. One sample usage case, from the times: watson can compare one patient's data to thousands of textbooks, clinical trials, and journal articles and deliver to his doctor suggested tests, patient questions, and treatments. The announcement comes the same week amazon held a conference touting its own cloud-based supercomputing offering, amazon web service — and in an impressive bit of trolling, ibm hired buses to circle the conference bearing watson ads. But the events serve to highlight the growing field's potential. One conference participant boasted that it had used aws to complete in 18 hours a project that would have taken 264 years using one server. \" this is the start of a shift in the way people interact with computers, \" an ibm vp says.",

This turned out to be news to the candidate herself, who was doing no such thing. Now a 28-year-old man has admitted to what he calls the \" prank \" against 19-year-old republican yvonne dean-bailey. The state attorney general, however, has another word for it: felony. Carl gibson has been charged with voter suppression, reports the union leader, an offense that carries a seven-year sentence. Before the charges were filed, gibson told the concord monitor that he \" probably had one too many beers \" before sending out the email. Technicians were easily able to trace it back to him. \"when you're trying to trick someone and fraudulently issuing out information in an effort to get people to forgo a fundamental right, i think that's a big deal, \" says an assistant attorney general. Gibson had previously worked for the democratic candidate in the race as a volunteer, but he got the boot about a month before his email stunt over a disagreement about tweets he was sending out. The all-important final detail: dean-bailey, the candidate he tried to defeat, easily won tuesday's election. ( sometimes it's the voters themselves caught in shady election behavior. )",

After that fatal scene, two protesters brought the show to a halt for what artistic director oskar eustis says was \" less than a minute \" in a statement. Laura loomer, 24, rushed the stage and cried out the former line, along with, \" stop the normalization of political violence against the right. \" the new york times reports she calls herself \" a right-wing investigative journalist and activist \" and has connections to james o ' keefe. A man the times frames as her \" collaborator, \" jack posobiec, went with a wwii reference, calling out, \" you are all goebbels. \" the pair were removed by security to applause. Loomer was ultimately charged with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct after refusing orders to back away from the theater. Posobiec explained their motivation to fox news, first echoing loomer, \" we were protesting what we saw was the normalization of violence. I couldn't believe they were going on with the play in light of what happened with the attack on congressman scalise. \" a tweet from the public theater described the two as \" paid protesters. \"",

The bbc explains the phenomenon in terms of an odometer that only goes up to 99,999 miles. Drive another mile, and it would roll to zero again, and start counting from there. What is known as \" integer overflow \" can, in some cases, prompt disaster, the bbc notes. Case in point: a european space agency rocket that exploded shortly after it launched because velocity readings were beyond its capacity. In other cases, the result is comical. Take, for instance, the 105-year-old woman who got an invitation to preschool because she was born in ' 07 — though not 2007, as the software involved expected. One number in particular is a problem for many of today's systems: 2,147,483,647, a number with its own wikipedia page. It's the highest number that a \" 32-bit signed register, \" as many systems run, can handle; the limit exists thanks to a need for digital efficiency, an expert tells the bbc. Youtube saw the problem firsthand: \" we never thought a video would be watched in numbers greater than a 32-bit integer ( =2,147,483,647 views ), but that was before we met psy, \" the site noted, referring to the musician whose \" gangnam style \" video \" broke \" the counter. ( as wired explained in 2014, youtube figured out a fix by going from 32-bit integers to 64-bit, so the view limit is now in the quintillions. ) more worryingly, the boeing 787 dreamliner may encounter a problem if its equipment has been left running for 2,147,483,647 hundredths of a second, or 248 days. And there are fears comparable to those surrounding the y2k bug centered on the year 2038. Fortunately, experts are on the lookout for such issues.

Research out of the albert einstein college of medicine found that females were five times more likely than men to suffer damage to the brain, reports scientific american. The study in radiology compared 49 female and 49 male soccer players who used headers, and it discovered noticeably more deterioration in the white-matter regions of the women's brains. This kind of damage wouldn't necessarily translate into concussions on the field, but to more low-grade problems that could accumulate over time and possibly lead to cognitive issues, reports npr. \" the most important finding here is that we see that in women's brains, actually looking at brain tissue, there seems to be a greater sensitivity to repetitive, very low-level injury relative to men, \" says lead author michael lipton. The researchers didn't look into why the disparity exists, but they note that men generally have more muscles in the neck area, which could limit whiplash.

For their leap into premium programming, youtube isn't attempting to imitate netflix, hulu, or amazon, which offer films and shows rivaling traditional hollywood content. While its first crop of movies and series don't look like they were filmed with a webcam in someone's basement, youtube originals also don't have the scope of a marvel movie or an episode of game of thrones either. For the reality show, the site enlisted kjellberg, who normally plays horror games, to swap playing scary video games on his channel to instead be dropped into frightening scenarios conceived by the walking dead creator skybound entertainment. Youtube currently has dozens of original programming projects in development for youtube red, and daniels said they plan to roll out between 15 and 20 shows and films in 2016.

Less than 24 hours after voting to gut the office of congressional ethics in a secret meeting monday, house republicans passed a motion during an emergency meeting tuesday to restore the independent office's old rules following a \" firestorm of criticism, \" the los angeles times reports. The new york times calls it an \" embarrassing \" start to a new republican-controlled congress, and politico says the reversal was a \" self-inflicted public relations debacle \" on what \" was supposed to be a jubilant day for the right. \" republican leaders in the house had warned against monday's vote, and criticisms of changes to the oce came from both parties, as well as constituents, watchdog groups, and the president-elect. Hours before the vote to reinstate the old oce rules, donald trump — in a series of tweets — agreed with house republicans that the oce is \" unfair \" but questioned their timing on gutting it, saying they should focus on tax reform and healthcare first. The oce was created after a series of 2008 scandals that put three members of congress in jail. On monday, house republicans — a number of them the onetime subjects of oce investigations — voted to prohibit the oce from accepting anonymous tips about lawmakers and investigating criminal activity, which is most of what the office does. The rule change would have given control of the oce to the very same lawmakers it's supposed to be investigating.",

Kelly's guidelines also call for customs and border protection to \" immediately begin planning, design, construction, and maintenance of a wall, \" the ap reports.

        "summary": "Exactly one month ago, 42-year-old barry massey walked out of a washington state prison. It's a day that may very well have never come. At age 14, massey became the youngest american at the time to be sentenced to life without parole; as a 13-year-old, he and a teen two years older shot and stabbed a store owner in the course of a robbery. But things took a turn in 2012, when the supreme court found sentences such as massey's to be cruel and unusual punishment in the case of juveniles. The ap reports that washington state law was subsequently altered to permit juvenile lifers to petition for release once they had served 25 years; massey's case was reviewed first, and conditional release was approved. The seattle times takes a look at what awaited him after 28 years behind bars. Massey took a trip to walmart, a place he had only heard about, on his first day out. It was one of a slew of things that are new to him: he has never driven a car, or even taken public transportation outside of a school bus. He's never tried alcohol ( and can't, per his release stipulations, notes kiro 7 ). He has forgotten how to swim but remembers how to ride a bike. Kiro 7 reports massey had to submit a release plan during his petitioning process, and that plan included moving in with a woman he married in a 2009 prison ceremony — a woman he met when she worked as a corrections officer at monroe corrections center, where he served his time. Rhonda massey quit her job to be with him and is now an investigator with the snohomish county office of public defense; the times has more on their controversial relationship.

People moved by the generosity of josh dall-leighton have contributed more than $ 48,000 so far on gofundme to cover his unpaid time spent away from work. The initial goal was $ 6,000, and the maine hospital scheduled to perform the transplant is worried that any excess money he'd get is tantamount to him selling his kidney, which is illegal. The tale began when christine royles, a single mom, wrote a message on her car window seeking a donor. Dall-leighton saw it and immediately texted her. When tests confirmed he was a match, the maine medical center began preparing for the operation, and a friend of dall-leighton's set up the online fundraising page for him. As for making a profit, \" obviously that wasn't our intention in any way, \" dall-leighton's wife tells wmtw. Royles, meanwhile, says she's \" just kind of in shock \" now that the operation is in limbo. The hospital says it is \" working through the donor process as we do with all patients of the maine transplant program. \" an official added yesterday that the hospital hopes \" to find a way to move forward. \" ( this woman's kidney donation triggered a chain reaction. )",

Since harmon was shot in the side, and since a knife police claim harmon was holding was found at the scene, gill determined the officers feared for their safety. Members of harmon's family say they see things differently, especially after viewing the footage thursday. They say harmon, who had been pulled over by the officers after riding his bicycle across six lanes of traffic without a red tail light on aug. 13, was bipolar and schizophrenic. One of harmon's nieces, alisha shaw, told the guardian, \" they just murdered him flat-out. \" the salt lake city police department had received praise before the shooting for its implementation of de-escalation training, which had resulted in more than two-and-a-half years without a fatal officer-involved shooting in the city.

It was again replaced, and again taken down, reports politico.

Agent thomas mcdonald took on the hopeless-looking case following another agent's promotion; seeking \" some measure of peace \" for patz's family, mcdonald contacted old witnesses and developed a 50-page \" patzifesto \" containing his findings. In the course of mcdonald's work, doubts were raised about the previous top suspect, jose ramos, who tended to develop close relationships with the children he abused; no such link between ramos and patz was uncovered. New suspect othniel miller's name popped up as part of mcdonald's search. When asked about a basement burial in one interview, he asked agents, \" what if the body was moved? \" meanwhile, the basement search is due to resume today, following a sudden halt yesterday, amid rain. At that point, reporters spotted something being loaded into a van, cnn notes. Yesterday, investigators reportedly found what may be a blood stain on a cinder block.",

The news organization, which is working on an investigative piece about how the fbi handled the clinton emails, says abedin forwarded maybe a \" handful \" of emails to weiner, none of which had been designated as classified at the time.

Neither abedin nor weiner responded to requests for comments for the story, but last fall abedin's lawyer said she had no idea how the emails had gotten there. The fbi is now trying to figure out how to resolve comey's inaccuracies, says propublica.

        "summary": "\" the detonation of status-6 in any [ large us port city ] would essentially wipe out their population into the far suburbs, \" says a senior analyst with the national institute for public policy. Status-6 — a mysterious russian nuclear weapon described in the nuclear posture review released friday by the trump administration — is what npr calls \" a doomsday machine. Or at least a doomsday-ish machine. \" the report describes status-6 as \" a new intercontinental, nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered, undersea autonomous torpedo. \" the underwater drone could travel for years underwater and carry a nuclear payload larger than any current us or russian weapon. While russian state tv leaked an image of status-6 in 2015, friday's report is the first time the us has publicly acknowledged it, according to cnn. Russia would likely use status-6 as a \" third-strike \" weapon if it's attacked by the us and unable to use its other nuclear missiles. However, it's also possible status-6 doesn't exist. Edward geist of the rand corp. Says russia may have simply enlarged a drawing of a normal torpedo \" to get our attention. \" the trump administration could have included it in the report to drum up support for its plan to strengthen the us nuclear arsenal. \" there is no indication from public information that russia is actively developing the system, but it is alarming to see it in a pentagon document, \" says adam mount at the federation of american scientists. Elsewhere in the report, the us discusses plans to make new, smaller atomic bombs as a deterrent against russia. The russian foreign minister calls the plan \" confrontational \" and \" anti-russian, \" the bbc reports.",

Sheikh hamad bin khalifa al-thani, 61, announced the news on national tv yesterday, though he didn't say when sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani would take over. The younger sheikh, however, is set to give a speech tomorrow and select a government afterward, the new york times reports. \" i am fully certain that he is up to the responsibility, deserving the confidence, capable of shouldering the responsibility and fulfilling the mission, \" sheikh hamad said. He took over from his own father in 1995, though in a decidedly less friendly manner: he launched a bloodless coup. Indeed, this kind of willing handover of power is extremely unusual in gulf arab dynasties, the ap notes. There are unconfirmed murmurs that it's related to sheikh hamad's health, but he's likely to continue to play a role in government. Though the country's prime minister is also likely to depart, politics in qatar — whose influence is growing — aren't likely to change much. Sheikh tamim \" has been involved very closely with qatari policy, both domestic and foreign... For some considerable time, \" says an al jazeera editor. Qatar has a sovereign wealth fund of some $ 100 billion, one of the biggest in the world, and it's been building its political resume as a mediator of international conflicts, including darfur; the taliban also recently opened a political office in the country.",

Unbeknownst to tyma, that person had since stopped paying the mortgage; the bank foreclosed on her and booted tyma from the home when an investment company bought it at auction — padlocking the door and leaving tyma's belongings in the streets. That was nov. 16, and her neighbors went into action, making sure her belongings were stored and her two dogs had a place to stay, the tampa bay times reports. But one neighbor went even further. Tyma approached danielle calder, 65, and asked calder to buy the house and rent it to her — and calder agreed.

Antonio zambrano-montes, 35, was allegedly throwing rocks at passing cars and then at police officers, but video of the incident appears to show him running away from officers before being shot. Now a spokesman for the task force investigating the shooting says the three officers involved fired at zambrano-montes a total of 17 times, five or six of those shots hit him, and none of them hit him in the back, nbc news reports. The spokesman also says that before the shootings a taser was used at least twice. The spokesman also confirmed that though a rock was found near zambrano-montes ' body, no gun or knife was found, the ap reports. The mexican government has criticized the use of deadly force in the case, the aclu has asked the justice department to get involved in the investigation, and residents of pasco — where the population is more than 50 % latino — are protesting. A local latino group also wants a federal investigation of the incident. The aclu notes that this was the fourth fatal shooting by pasco police in six months, nbc reports, but the ap notes that similar investigations into the first three incidents resulted in the officers involved being exonerated.",

There was one notably unexpected and tragic outcome: ibarra had arranged for a horse race during the celebration, with a nearly $ 500 prize, and the owner of one of the horses was killed when he got too close to the galloping action.",

Authorities then helped evacuate the motel's 75 guests, per q13 fox. Thirty minutes later, an explosion rocked the building. No one was killed, though a gas employee suffered a broken back, neck, and severe burns, reports king 5. Two firefighters were also injured, one with bruised ribs, the other with a concussion.

Twenty percent favor an approach that relies only on spending cuts and 4 % favor an approach that uses tax increases alone. These results are based on a july 7-10 gallup poll, conducted as government leaders from both parties continued negotiating an agreement to raise the federal debt limit. Both republicans and democrats appear willing to raise the debt limit, provided the government outlines plans to significantly reduce federal deficits in the future. The parties generally agree on making deep spending cuts, but do not agree on whether tax increases should be included to help reach their target goals for deficit reduction. Many republicans in congress oppose any such tax increases; thus, the legislation may not pass if tax hikes are included. Americans do not necessarily share this view, with 20 % saying deficit reduction should come only through spending cuts. That percentage is a little higher, 26 %, among those who identify as republicans. Republicans do, however, tilt heavily in favor of reducing the deficit primarily if not exclusively with spending cuts ( 67 % ) as opposed to tax increases ( 3 % ).

Us and south korean officials believe the missile, like one fired in february, was a kn-15 medium-range missile, a type of missile more mobile, easier to launch, and harder to detect than other missiles in pyongyang's arsenal, the ap reports. The one fired in february traveled 310 miles, but this one only flew around 37 miles, suggesting the test may not have been a complete success. North korea's missile and nuclear weapons program was already expected to be a main focus of the talks between xi and trump, who recently said the us can deal with the problem alone if china is unwilling to help. \" the launch took place possibly in consideration of the us-china summit, while at the same time it was to check its missile capability, \" a south korean official tells reuters. Japan condemned the latest launch as \" extremely problematic, \" while secretary of state rex tillerson said: \" the united states has spoken enough about north korea. We have no further comment. \" ( this week, a north korean defector had an ominous warning about kim jong un's state of mind. )",

They were familiar with the store's layout and planned to ambush more officers, gillespie said, and they nearly succeeded when one officer followed jerad around a corner, where amanda surprised him and fired at him. The officer shot amanda in the shoulder and left, giving his information to the tactical unit that ultimately took jerad down after a 15-minute gunfight, during which jerad tried to safeguard amanda, who was on the ground, by stacking items around her. Jerad briefly spoke to her after he was shot in the chest; she fatally shot herself.

' \" yes, i did say that word however i was saying it in the context of art history; i wasn't being vulgar, \" she said. The substitute art teacher claims she said it to a room full of 8th graders trying to explain historical interpretations of georgia o ' keefe's paintings. But to school officials, wint crossed the line -- and violated school policy. \" i did not know about this policy, they were entirely within their right to remove me, however i was not aware of this policy beforehand; if i had known about this policy, i would have never done it without approval, \" wint said. But her explanation wasn't enough; harper creek community schools released a quote from their school handbook, indicating teachers are required to get advanced approval when discussing any form of reproductive health. Wint says"

All day kenyan security officials had claimed to have the situation under control, but just hours before he spoke, al-shabab said it was still holding hostages, and that there were \" countless dead bodies \" in the mall.",

The structures are also crude attempts at circles, indicating that an architect marked the shapes by walking a rope from the center, but messed up the circle where the ground was uneven. What's more, one circle has three rock piles ( or \" cairns \" ) on its edge that might have functioned as burial sites.
