        "summary": "Jacqueline gomez was already acting \" different \" shortly before she left aldine isd's prom friday night, says close friend justice gonzalez. \" she was stuttering, not talking clear. Her eyes were low, like she was dizzy. \" the next morning, her date found the 17-year-old dead in their houston motel room. Seven hours later, \" he was posting pictures of himself crying on instagram, \" gonzalez tells the houston chronicle. So she texted him to ask what happened to gomez; gonzalez let the newspaper see the messages. They read in part: \" they [ likely law enforcement officials ] said she overdosed. I woke up. I tried waking her but she wouldn't. I was screaming and crying telling her to wake up. But she didn't. She didn't. \" the texts, interspersed with frowning and crying emoticons, add that gomez was \" perfectly fine and happy \" when they left the prom and \" happy \" when they went to sleep, but that they drank alcohol — and gomez also took hydrocodone. \" i shoulda took them away and flushed em, \" he texted, adding that he didn't know where she had gotten the painkiller or how many pills she had taken. But gomez's friends and family insist she was no \" party girl, \" and gonzalez says she never saw her take drugs or talk about taking them. She adds that gomez's date \" was a couple of years older... I remember telling her to be careful when she started to leave. \" meanwhile, gomez's mother tells khou her daughter was not supposed to go to the hotel after prom. Gomez's date's mom picked them up from the dance and asked gomez's mom, via phone, if gomez could spend the night at their house. \" i said no, bring her back home, \" says gomez's mom. But her daughter never arrived — and police say it was gomez's date's mother who booked the hotel room for her son. The results of the autopsy are likely weeks out.",

Farenthold's office has not officially announced the move, but news is dribbling out to local party officials. Politico and abc affiliate crossroads today confirm the development. Farenthold has come under fire in the #metoo movement, with former staffers complaining that he runs an office where lewd comments and behavior are the norm. The house ethics panel previously announced an investigation, and cnn added to the stockpile on wednesday with an interview of former senior aide michael rekola. The aide says he finally quit after farenthold made lewd jokes in front of everyone about rekola's future sex life as rekola was getting set to leave town to get married. Farenthold denies it. Rekola maintains that it's just one small example of an atmosphere that eventually made him physically ill. ( farenthold reportedly used public funds to settle a sexual harassment complaint made by a former female staffer. )",

Zuckerberg defended the paypal founder, facebook's first investor, saying the social network supports differing political views, even tough ones. \" we can't create a culture that says it cares about diversity and then excludes almost half the country because they back a political candidate, \" zuckerberg wrote. \" there are many reasons a person might support trump that do not involve racism, sexism, xenophobia, or accepting sexual assault. \" usa today notes that the thiel brouhaha comes as the tech industry is under fire for its lack of diversity. Nearly seven out of 10 facebook employees are men, with a scant percentage of african-americans. Not everyone agrees. Ellen pao, co-founder of project include, said her diversity initiative would cut ties to y combinator, an incubator in which thiel is a partner. \" this isn't a disagreement on tax policy, \" pao posted on medium. \" giving more power to someone whose ascension and behavior strike fear into so many people is unacceptable. \" ( thiel bankrolled hulk hogan's lawsuit against gawker. )",

Well, that show exists in the czech republic — and some people aren't too thrilled to see the nazis turned into casual entertainment, the guardian reports. Called holiday in the protectorate, the show follows three generations of a family trying to survive in a re-creation of the nazi-ruled protectorate of bohemia and moravia. They cope with paltry rations, german soldiers, gestapo interrogations, blackmailers, and allied bombing raids, but $ 40,000 awaits if they can last for two months, variety reports. \" when starting the project, we knew that it may provoke a discussion on how far such a genre may go, \" says director zora cejnkova. Indeed: \" fortunately for the family, they will not be treated like the 82,309 jews who lived in the protectorate and were deported by the nazis to concentration and death camps, or were killed by czech collaborators, \" writes renee ghert-zand in the times of israel. The telegraph reports that a critic on an internet forum quipped, \" what are they going to do next? big brother auschwitz? \" yet cejnkova swears that the show — which hired historians and a psychologist for authenticity's sake — is a serious endeavor: \" i tried to show that period with utter seriousness and with respect for its tragic character, \" he says. About 71,000 of the protectorate's jews were killed in the holocaust. ( recently found: hitler's long-lost bronze horses. )",

Further, madonna herself even joked her concert could be \" cut off \" due to scotland's gun laws — which came about after a 1996 massacre. Apparently she thought shock value was more important than good taste and brandished the guns anyway — but she won't face punishment, just a lot of backlash, the daily record reports.

        "summary": "The virginia home of president trump's former campaign chairman was raided by fbi agents late last month, sources tell the washington post. Paul manafort had voluntarily met with investigators for the senate intelligence committee on july 25, and the pre-dawn raid — which came with no advance warning — was carried out the following day by agents working with special counsel robert mueller, who's overseeing the investigation into russian tampering with the 2016 election. The agents, operating under a search warrant, took documents and other materials. A source also spoke to the new york times about the raid and said agents were looking for tax documents and foreign banking records. The times notes that those types of records are usually sought when there's an investigation into violations of a law requiring americans to report their foreign banking accounts. Sources say mueller is probing allegations related to manafort's work for the ukrainian government and his role in the the june 2016 meeting between donald trump jr. And a russian lawyer, in which russians allegedly promised to share info that could hurt hillary clinton. Manafort has been voluntarily handing over documents to congressional committees probing the election meddling, including his notes from the aforementioned meeting, but the raid suggests mueller's investigators may not believe he's turning over everything. Sources say mueller may be focusing on manafort in an effort to build a separate case against him, with the goal of getting manafort to turn on others in trump's inner circle in an attempt to lessen the legal ramifications against himself. Abc news notes that manafort resigned from trump's campaign team amid questions about his foreign business connections.",

That organic compound is the main culprit in the stench that often results after a garlic-infused meal, explains a new video by the american chemical society and the compound interest chemistry blog. Three other compounds also play a role, but allyl methyl sulfide takes longer to break down in the body and thus takes most of the blame. None of the compounds are present in whole garlic but are instead created when the garlic is chopped or crushed, notes a summary of the video by nbc news. And it's not as if the odor arises because you've got some garlic stuck in your teeth — it's way more pernicious than that, explains time. The offending compound enters the bloodstream and leaves the body through urine, sweat, and, yes, breath. What to do? the video suggests eating parsley or drinking milk. ( which might be necessary, because garlic is considered an aphrodisiac by some. )",

But when his coffin was removed from the swedish city's cathedral, scientists were amazed to discover a tiny body, that of a fetus five to six months old, had been concealed at his feet, tucked away in a layer of herbs, the guardian reports. Dna tests will be performed to see if the premature baby is related to the bishop, but researchers suspect that it may have been born illegitimately to a member of his household, who placed it in the coffin to ensure it had a better resting place than the unsanctified ground such babies were buried in. The director of lund's history museum tells radio sweden that researchers were almost as surprised to find that the bishop, who was buried on a mattress stuffed with juniper berries and other herbs, still had his internal organs, making him a \" time capsule \" from 1679 and \" one of the best-preserved human bodies from the 1600s, \" per lund university. \" everyone thought the bishop was embalmed, in which case, there are no internal organs left in the body, \" says the museum director. But he apparently \" dried out naturally, \" according to the university, the result of a winter burial, constant airflow, the plants in his coffin, and his lean body, among other factors. Even the bishop's clothes are in pretty good shape, researchers say. After more tests are carried out on the two bodies, they will be reburied together, the guardian reports.

Per the new york times, parents allege teachers at ryb kindergarten in xintiandi in eastern beijing made kids take their clothes off, poked them with needles, gave them pills that made them sleepy, and locked them in a dark room, though local cops and education officials haven't confirmed the allegations. The rumors have erupted into what the times calls a \" cacophony of fury, \" with some parents telling the media they fear their children may even have been molested. Underlying the outcry is chinese citizens ' overall distrust of the government and of institutions their kids attend — especially in a country where, until recently, parents doted on just one child. Parents say the kids may have been scared into silence by \" devil teachers. \" \" the teacher told the kids, ' i've got a long, long telescope that can see right into your home, and i ' ll know just what you've been saying and doing, \" one woman told reporters. And it's not just this facility where concerns have cropped up. Other ryb sites — the company is involved with more than 250 facilities across china — and non-ryb child care centers have also faced abuse accusations. Cops say they're looking into allegations against the kindergarten, one of the more competitive and expensive options around: quartz notes the monthly tuition of $ 750 or so is about half of an average beijing resident's monthly salary. Per the south china morning post, cops have their hands on surveillance video. Meanwhile, the guardian reports ryb has issued a statement saying it's \" deeply sorry \" for the commotion.",

Brooke crews testified in court that she lied to her then-boyfriend william hoehn about being pregnant, emailing him a fake pregnancy test and fake sonogram, and that in august 2017 he told her he didn't believe she was really pregnant and that she'd better \" produce a baby. \" crews said her relationship with hoehn was rocky and violent, and that she came up with the pregnancy scheme after one of their breakups, to keep from losing him, the ap reports. She described pushing 22-year-old savanna greywind, whom she'd lured to her apartment, the bismarck tribune reports; greywind hit her head on the bathroom sink and lost consciousness. Crews said she then cut the baby out of greywind's body using a box cutter. Crews, testifying in hoehn's trial on conspiracy to commit murder charges, said she never \" explicitly \" told hoehn she planned to kill greywind and take her baby, and that hoehn appeared surprised when he walked into the bathroom. She said he then got a rope, tightened it around greywind's neck, and said, \" if she wasn't dead before, she is now. \" she said authorities searched the apartment three times but didn't find her body or the baby, and that hoehn ultimately disposed of the body. The baby was found days after greywind was reported missing. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy testified monday, asserting greywind had no evidence of head injuries, but that he couldn't be sure whether it was blood loss or strangulation that killed her. Hoehn has admitted to helping crews cover up the murder but says he had no advance knowledge of the plan. Crews pleaded guilty and is serving a life sentence.

        "summary": "Margaret howe lovatt's relationship with a dolphin in the 1960s became fodder for hustler in the ' 70s — and ended in tragedy. Lovatt was working with scientist john lilly, on the caribbean island of st. Thomas, to better understand dolphins, and she hoped to teach one of them to speak english. To that end, she began living with a dolphin named peter for 24 hours a day, six days a week, writes christopher riley, who recently filmed a documentary about lovatt's story, in the guardian. The young peter had sexual urges: \" he was very, very interested in my anatomy, \" lovatt says. Getting him to other dolphins was a cumbersome effort, so she relieved his urges manually. \" it would just become part of what was going on, like an itch — just get rid of it, scratch it, and move on, \" she recalls. \" it wasn't sexual on my part. Sensuous perhaps. \" after six months, the experiment ended, and peter was shipped to another facility. Shortly afterward, he committed what experts say was a suicide; dolphins are known to intentionally stop breathing. The cause, says a vet who was involved in the project, was lost love. Riley's documentary, the girl who talked to dolphins, airs on the bbc this month. The story, it seems, isn't unique: a man tells britain's mirror about his own sexual relationship with a dolphin; he believes her death afterward was a suicide, too.

        "summary": "A cdc study of almost 28,000 women has shown links between use of the antidepressants paxil and prozac and birth defects, reuters reports. The study, published in the british medical journal, sought to answer long-debated questions about the effect of taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or ssris, during pregnancy, and whether the entire class of drugs or only certain ssris presented a risk, the news agency notes. Off the hook ( at least according to this study ): zoloft, celexa, and lexapro. In a survey, researchers asked the participants if they had taken any of those five antidepressants from one month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, then looked at women who ended up having children with birth defects. Only women who took prozac ( generic name fluoxetine ) and paxil ( paroxetine ) showed increased risk, with birth defects occurring 2 to 3.5 times more frequently than women who didn't take those drugs. Prozac was linked to a defect in which children's skulls were misshapen, while paxil was associated with a defect in which the intestines poke outside the body, as well as missing parts of the brain and skull, the study notes; both were also tied to a heart defect. But the study's lead author tells npr that the overall risk is still not huge ( e.g., the risk for brain and skull malformation crept up from 2 to 7 out of 10,000 births when paroxetine was used ), and she stresses the study only shows a link — it doesn't prove the meds actually caused the defects. Eli lilly, which distributes prozac, tells abc news that it puts its drugs through rigorous evaluations and that prozac is \" considered as having a positive benefit-risk profile for patients by regulatory authorities and physicians around the world. \" glaxosmithkline, which makes paxil, says its warning labels tell doctors to warn patients about risks and \" that for some the benefits of therapy may continue to outweigh the potential risk. \"",

This month, virginia's supreme court will rule on whether yelp has to give up those names, thanks to a lawsuit from the owner of a carpet cleaning service, who says his annual sales fell $ 2.5 million after a spate of bad yelp reviews that he couldn't match to actual customers.

It's actually the less gruesome seventh edition, which came in 1857, that's best known, the guardian reports. As for the tales in the first edition, \" some of them are extremely dark and harrowing, \" zipes tells npr in an interview. \" many are somewhat erotic and deal with incest.

One brother kills the other, and their mother, who's bathing a baby, sees the brutality through a window. So she goes and kills the still-living brother. That leaves time for the baby to die in the bath, and all this prompts the mother to kill herself. Not exactly something you'd be likely to read to your 3-year-old. Zipes, however, sees some \" hope \" in the tales. \" for the most part, there is social justice in these tales, and...

Get push notifications with news, features and more. \"i had a dream and then i turned on the lights and she's dead on the floor, \" he says in a 911 call obtained by people. \"i have blood all over me and there's a bloody knife on the bed and i think i did it. I can't believe this. \" he told the dispatcher through tears that his wife wasn't breathing and that he was afraid to get close to her — \"i ' m so scared, \" he said. Phelps is charged with murder and is being held at wake county detention center without bail, a jail spokesperson tells people. As police work to determine the circumstances around lauren's death, phelps suggested during the 911 call that cold medicine he took the night before might have led to his alleged actions.

            "A new beginning after a year of their relationship blossoming, the couple has a date night in the works. A nice, little outing every once in awhile was a nice break in their busy schedules. But a sudden illness fell upon lauren, and so matthew suggested they stay home and he order a pizza, which was proper medicine to any ailment they encountered. Lauren instead made the point that because of the holidays there would not be another time for them to have a night out. Matthew then insisted on going to panera bread which sounded both healthy and yummy. Lauren agreed and so they got in the car and started driving to their destination. There was a panera bread located only 2 minutes from their house but matthew took a different route which confused lauren, making her say, \" umm isn't panera that way? \" to which matthew, responded, \" trust me. I've got something planned. \" so the two arrived and the whole time matthew is checking his watch; this does not go unnoticed. Lauren investigated, \" uh, do we have somewhere to be? are we late for something, matthew? \" \" no, no take your time, \" matthew resolved. They finished up their eating then headed out somewhere that to lauren looked very curious. As"

An oxford philosophers are considering how future technology could, for instance, make a jail sentence feel as though it lasted 1,000 years, they tell aeon magazine. After all, there are already \" a number of psychoactive drugs that distort people's sense of time, \" and existing interrogation scenarios tinker with lighting to prevent subjects from knowing the time, says rebecca roache. In a blog post, roache advances an even more mind-bending idea: some point to a future in which brain scans allow us to upload the human brain onto a computer ( there's even a wikipedia page about it ). If that happens, we could perhaps \" speed up \" a prisoner's mind. \" uploading the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight-and-a-half hours, \" roache writes. That would, she notes, \" be much cheaper for the taxpayer. \" but, she points out, \" the goal isn't simply to imagine a bunch of futuristic punishments — the goal is to look at today's punishments through the lens of the future. \"",

            "Even in my most religious moments, i have never been able to take the idea of hell seriously. Prevailing christian theology asks us to believe that an all-powerful, all-knowing being would do what no human parent could ever do: create tens of billions of flawed and fragile creatures, pluck out a few favourites to shower in transcendent love, and send the rest to an eternity of unrelenting torment. That story has always seemed like an intellectual relic to me, a holdover from barbarism, or worse, a myth meant to coerce belief. But stripped of the religious particulars, i can see the appeal of hell as an instrument of justice, a way of righting wrongs beyond the grave. Especially in unusual circumstances.

According to the review on antimicrobial resistance, deaths caused by drug resistance will rise from 700,000 in 2015 to an estimated 10 million per year in 2050. The problem: people around the world are taking more antibiotics, rendering them less effective, while global food production uses at least as many, the guardian reports. Meanwhile, fewer new antibiotics are being made. In time, the study says, we may no longer be able to treat diseases that are now curable. \" the problem is straightforward, \" writes jim o ' neill, who chairs the review, in the guardian. \" as valuable as scientific breakthroughs may be, it takes a lot of work to turn them into marketable drugs. And... Antibiotics generally produce low — and sometimes even negative — returns on investment for the pharmaceutical makers that develop them. \" so he's calling on philanthropists and governments to create an r&d fund to create new antimicrobial drugs. He estimates a cost of less than 0.1 % of global gdp, far less than the alternative: \" $ 100 trillion in lost production by 2050 and 10 million lives lost every year. \" ( here's the latest food chain to go antibiotics-free. )",

She teamed the trousers, that retail for close to $ 1700, with a pair of $ 236 burberry sneakers – another proud british fashion house.

Now emswiler is part of a commission studying the possibility of moving massachusetts from the eastern time zone to the atlantic time zone, currently home to puerto rico and a number of eastern canadian provinces, the wall street journal reports. The change would add a fifth time zone to the contiguous us. Advocates say the switch, which would also do away with the twice-a-year daylight saving time switch, could boost the economy by keeping sunlight lovers in state and out shopping later, have public health benefits, and reduce crime. Even supporters of the plan admit massachusetts wouldn't be able to go it alone. To succeed, most of new england — and potentially new york — would have to make the switch, too, to lessen confusion for financial markets, tv schedules, and travelers. Maine, at least, appears to be on board. A bill recently passed the state legislature that would allow residents to vote on joining the atlantic time zone and do away with daylight saving time, as long as massachusetts and new hampshire did the same, quartz reports. \" why do we keep doing this to ourselves? \" asks state rep. Donna bailey, who introduced the bill, regarding another dark winter in new england. There are, of course, potential drawbacks besides increased time-zone confusion. For one, schools would likely have to push start times back to keep kids who aren't \" fully awake \" from walking to school in the dark.",

            "\"why do we keep doing this to ourselves? \" donna bailey, a democratic state representative in maine and crusader against anachronistic and dangerous institutions, asked the wall street journal ( paywall ). It's an excellent question. Earlier this year, bailey sponsored a bill that would move maine to the atlantic time zone, an hour ahead of its current position in the eastern time zone, and no longer observe daylight saving time. The bill passed both chambers of the maine state legislature. But the senate added a provision that maine voters must approve the change in a referendum, and the referendum could only be triggered by neighboring massachusetts and new hampshire changing their time, too. Since neither of those states had immediate plans to change their time zones, the move seemed doomed. But now there is hope. Massachusetts is considering a permanent change in its time zone. A commission is studying the issue was prompted by public health advocate tom emswiler. He argues that a shift to atlantic time would boost the economy by encouraging college students to stay in massachusetts, instead of moving to sunnier places like new york city."

Fluoridation passed a vote in 1978, but the decision was overturned two years later before any fluoride was added to the water, the ap reports.

        "summary": "Pro-democracy protesters continued to block key roads in hong kong today, and while the mood has remained peaceful, some expect a showdown with police is looming ahead of tomorrow's chinese national day holiday. Workers have the day off, which could make for larger gatherings. Hong kong chief executive leung chun-ying — whose resignation protesters are demanding — has called for the protests to end immediately and warned activists that beijing will never give in to their demands. Ahead of a rumored effort to clear the streets, protesters have stockpiled supplies and built barricades, reports reuters. More: the \" occupy central \" movement had earlier hinted that tomorrow would mark the start of its protest, but it was launched early after a student rally over the weekend. The national day fireworks have already been canceled. Analysts believe tomorrow could be a \" tipping point \" in the protests, and one that could result in a harsh beijing-ordered crackdown, reports the atlantic. \" there's a sequence of points where things can turn one way or the other, \" says political scientist jay ulfelder. \" will people show up? once they show up, will more people show up in response? then you start getting into the state reacting. \" ulfelder is the director of the early warning project, which analyzes the risks of mass atrocities. Leung says that despite the city's worst unrest in decades, hong kong's police will be able to control the situation without needing to call in china's people's liberation army soldiers. \" when a problem arises in hong kong, our police force should be able to solve it. We don't need to ask to deploy the pla, \" he told reporters. Developments in hong kong's \" umbrella revolution \" are being watched very closely in taiwan. Chinese president xi jinping has said the island should reunite with the rest of china under the same \" one country, two systems \" deal as hong kong, but taiwan president ma ying-jeou has rejected the deal and says he supports hong kong's demands for \" universal suffrage, \" reports the bbc. In mainland china, meanwhile, censorship has been stepped up and state media have reported only that police have acted to curtail an illegal gathering in hong kong, the ap reports.",

Despite their proximity, the two sides previously worked little together. Taiwan has enjoyed full universal suffrage since 1996; but a year later, hong kong returned to chinese rule.

Born jean-baptiste ndahindurwa, he was a member of the country's tutsi ethic minority group, but when he ascended to the throne in 1959, tensions were already boiling over between the tutsis and the belgian-supported hutus. In july 1960, king kigeli fled to what is now tanzania, and in 1961, the hutus abolished the monarchy altogether and elected a president of their choosing instead. From that point, king kigeli lived elsewhere — first in tanzania, then in uganda thanks to idi amin's asylum offering, and then in kenya after amin suffered his own coup in 1979. Ndahindurwa was granted us asylum in 1992, and he continued to harbor hopes of one day returning to rwanda as its rightful king, despite continuing bloodshed there. He set up a charity here in the us to help rwandan refugees and orphans, but he spent much of his time in america living in what foreign policy describes as \" impoverished obscurity. \" a 2013 washingtonian profile found the \" tottering \" 7-foot-2-inch king living outside of dc, surviving on food stamps and a section 8 housing subsidy. \" they call me the king of africa, \" he said of his neighbors, relaying how local kids would often show up at his doorstep for chocolates and other treats.

At least four civilians awaiting evacuation were killed in the attack, but the convoy ultimately managed to get 611 people out, while sustaining no un casualties. Accusations flew afterward. The un didn't officially blame anyone, but some un employees tell the wall street journal that regime loyalists were responsible. Many alawites, the sect to which bashar al-assad belongs, had opposed the convoy, arguing that it would help the rebels escape. The regime blames the rebels, saying they didn't want civilians to leave — though the un says there's no evidence backing regime claims that the rebels are using human shields. Once the convoy was out, a dispute broke out because 130 fighting-age men were among the evacuees. The government seized the men for interrogations — the original deal allowing the convoy had stipulated that men aged 16 to 54 would face a \" judicial process \" if they left, the la times reports. The government tells the bbc that 103 \" militants \" were detained, and then released.",

            "Bienvenidos a racial dialogue, friends. Next month, disney will formally introduce its newest proponent of absolute monarchy: princess sofia. When the coming of sofia was first announced in late 2011, the character immediately drew criticism from people who believe that exposing young girls to princesses will make them grow up to be desperate sluts who hate science and only want to be princesses. But decrying poor feminine role models can grow wearisome after a while. The one subject people never tire of discussing is race. Luckily, disney has just surprised everyone by announcing that, not only is sofia a baby ( her movies and tv show are geared toward children aged 2-7 ) — she's a spicy latina baby. This came up during a recent press tour of the sofia production offices, when a blogger noticed that sofia's mother miranda was depicted with a darker complexion than the other characters. That's when executive producer jamie mitchell confirmed the big news. \" she's latina. \" however, according to vice president of disney junior original programming joe d ' ambrosia, sofia is a special brand of latina — a latina secreta — whose latinality will never be acknowledged in her storyline. \" we never actually call it out. \" in other words, she is latina only in the sense that disney has just"

But another name is being increasingly mentioned along with kushner's, that of national economic council director gary cohn. In a profile of cohn, the washington post says he and \" like minded moderates \" are on a roll, having persuaded president trump to shift course toward more mainstream economic policies such as easing up on china. For those unfamiliar with cohn, two big details are pertinent about his resume: he's a former president of goldman sachs ( and thus is very, very rich, per cnn ) and he's a registered democrat. Now, his star is rising so fast in the white house that the post says he's being mentioned as a possible chief of staff if reince priebus goes. As dealbreaker puts it, \" cohn has finally learned how to operate donald trump. \" but cohn's apparent influence has raised concerns among hardline conservatives. Rush limbaugh, for example, has called him \" a very ideological liberal democrat. \" at vox, however, matthew yglesias pushes back against the notion that cohn is some kind of left-leaning moderate, and david dayen at the nation echoes the point. Yes, cohn is \" honorary president \" now, but that should alarm \" any american outside of an executive suite, \" dayen writes. \" if you liked goldman sachs pulling the strings in washington, you're going to love it when they're actually running the show directly. \" ( another name that appears to be on the rise within the white house: dina powell. )",

About 70 % of the world's forested areas are situated within a half-mile of the actual forest edge, per the monitor. The result of so many fragmented habitats is \" ruinous, \" notes the new yorker. This study found that broken-up areas on average lose half their plant and animal species within two decades, the monitor reports. \" once a forest disappears, the resulting area is more exposed and experiences greater extremes of temperature, humidity, and wind, \" co-author douglas levey tells the monitor. To make things worse, levey adds, intruding species find their way into the disrupted habitat as well. All is not doomed, though: because fragmentation often happens very slowly, it's possible to reconnect forest \" clumps \" by planting linking trees, levey says: \" it's never too late to preserve what we already have. \" ( the amazon's biggest alleged \" deforester \" was recently arrested. )",

            "The first paved highway across the brazilian amazon began, in the nineteen-seventies, as a narrow, hard-won cut through dense rainforest. The road, which connects the northern port city of belém with the country's capital, brasília, twelve hundred miles away, was hailed as a huge step in the region's development, and so it was: it quickly spawned a network of smaller roads and new towns, drawing industry to the brazilian interior. But the ecological price was high. Today, much of the belém-brasília highway is flanked by cattle pastures — a swath of deforestation some two hundred and fifty miles wide, stretching from horizon to horizon. Across the planet, road construction has similarly destroyed or splintered natural habitats. In equatorial africa's congo basin, logging roads have attracted a new wave of elephant poachers; in siberia, road expansion has caused an outbreak of wildfires; in suriname, roads invite illegal gold mining; and in finland, so many reindeer are killed by cars that herders have considered marking the animals with reflective paint. \"roads scare the hell out of ecologists, \" william laurance, a professor at james cook university, in australia, said. \"you can't be in my line of business and not be struck by their transformative power. \" laurance has spent most of his career"

The new york times reports that, before he left his post at president trump's request, sessions signed off on strict new guidelines around consent decrees, court-mandated contracts between the department of justice and local governments to revamp police departments hit with allegations regarding abuse and civil rights violations. Such agreements are already in place in cities such as ferguson, mo., as well as chicago and baltimore, with the latter previously drawing the ire of sessions, who said the city was \" one of the most tragic examples \" of how these decrees hamstring cops, per the baltimore sun. Among the new dictates surrounding the decrees: they need to get the green light from top doj officials ( not lawyers ), they generally can't be in place for more than three years, and they have to include a \" sunset \" provision that nixes the decree as soon as the state or local government can show they've complied with federal law. The new guidelines are in line with sessions'strong advocacy for law enforcement, and in contrast to the efforts of the obama administration, which entered into more than a dozen of these decrees to help solidify relationships between police and their communities. \" this memo will make the justice department much less effective in enforcing civil rights laws, \" a former doj civil rights attorney tells the times.

        "summary": "President trump made a foreign policy move thursday almost as surprising as alienating australians: he appeared to shift policy on israel, taking a line closer to that of the obama administration and warning the country that announcing new or expanded settlements is \" undermining \" peace efforts, the jerusalem post reports. Israel approved thousands of new settler homes on the west bank just days after trump's inauguration. A white house official tells the post that the trump administration supports a two-state solution and \" remains committed to advancing a comprehensive final-status agreement between israel and the palestinians. \" in other coverage: in what was seen as an attempt to dial back the statements made to the post a little, the white house issued a statement later in the day saying it has no \" official position on settlement activity, \" the washington post reports. But though the administration doesn't believe settlements are \" an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal, \" the statement said. The new york times describes the new attitude to settlements as an \" abrupt turnaround \" and notes that the shift came after trump briefly met jordan's king abdullah ii at the national prayer breakfast. Trump will meet israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on feb. 15. Haaretz looks at what's new and what isn't in the white house statements, concluding that the trump administration is taking much the same line as us administrations have done for decades, though his policies appears to have more in common with george w. Bush's approach than barack obama's. The guardian reports that israeli deputy foreign minister tzipi hotovely slammed the white house for criticizing settlement policy. \" the current israeli government was elected to act on the jewish people's right to build in all parts of our land and we must respect the will of the people who elected us for this purpose, \" she said in a statement. The ap reports that a spokesman for a group representing israeli settlers brushed off the white house statements, which came hours after netanyahu vowed that the first new settlements in the west bank, as opposed to expansions, since 1992 would be built as soon as possible. \" nothing is more natural and morally just than jews building in judea, \" said a rep from the yesha settlers ' council. \" we look forward to working closely with our friends in the new trump administration to build a brighter future. \"",

Expect to see more attacks from the others on stage, particularly rick santorum and possibly perry. The heat is on mitt romney: when perry was the frontrunner, attacks focused on him. Now that romney is in first place, he ' ll likely find himself in that position. Jon huntsman, perry, santorum, and cain will all likely take romney on; his healthcare plan is a certain target. This may be the first debate from which he does not emerge unscathed. What will perry focus on? some say he must address texas ' controversial bill giving illegal immigrants in-state tuition, but perry's camp indicates they'd rather focus on jobs and the economy. Off-topic questions about his racist camp name and his backer's denunciation of mormonism will surely come up as well. Perhaps the most important question of all: which candidate will inspire a saturday night live skit? the washington post/bloomberg debate begins at 8pm edt.",

Divers, helicopters, and dozens of boats scrambled to pluck people from the water after the boat sent a distress call and sank while on its way to the island of jeju, reports the ap, in what it calls a \" frantic, hours-long rescue by dozens of ships and helicopters. \" yonhap reports that fears are now mounting that many of the missing are trapped inside; it took divers hours to get into the ship, but the first three areas they searched were free of bodies. The water temp is reportedly about 54 degrees fahrenheit, cold enough for hypothermia to start to set in within about 90 minutes. Survivors described terrifying scenes inside the ferry after it apparently hit something and began to tilt severely, trapping people inside as water rushed in. One surviving passenger tells cnn that he tried to save others but there were some he couldn't get to in time. \" i stayed till the last to rescue people at the hall, \" he says. \" but the water was coming in so fast ( that ) some didn't make it out. \" rescue teams were able to pull some survivors through windows before it submerged.

        "summary": "\" the holy grail of shipwrecks \" has finally been found off the coast of colombia, mashable reports. \" great news! we have found the san jose galleon, \" colombian president juan manuel santos tweeted friday. The gold, silver, gems, and jewelry carried by the spanish galleon — which was sunk by the british in 1708 — are thought to be worth anywhere from $ 1.5 billion to $ 17 billion. That would make it one of the largest treasures ever lost at sea, according to the bbc. The galleon was carrying its booty — much of which the financial times notes likely originated in peru — from spain's colonies in south america back home when it was attacked, sinking in 1,000 feet of water 16 miles off the coast of the city of cartagena. According to the financial times, the shipwreck was commemorated in gabriel garcía márquez's love in the time of cholera. A us company called sea search armada first located the area of the wreck in 1981, mashable reports. But the company claimed colombia went back on a deal to split the treasure, leading to decades of lawsuits. An american court eventually ruled the wreck and its treasure belonged to colombia in 2011. According to the financial times, santos credited the find to the colombian institute of anthropology and history, the national navy, and \" foreign scientists. \" the head of the institute calls the discovery a \" major triumph. \" and the bbc reports that santos plans to build a museum in cartagena to house the treasure — the wreck was discovered near the port city, though colombia won't say exactly where. ( the san jose may be the holy grail of shipwrecks, but this is the \" shipwreck capital of the world. \" )",

        "summary": "As the world comes to terms with the sudden and incredibly unusual resignation of the papacy by pope benedict xvi, the general consensus appears to be that joseph ratzinger was a scholarly, introverted conservative who will ultimately be remembered most for the controversies that surrounded him. Among the opinions: despite trying twice, benedict was never able to tame the wild and byzantine vatican bureaucracy. \" the pope's failure to establish a grip on the curia was to cost him dear, all the more because he showed a marked reluctance to consult others, \" writes john hooper in the guardian, noting the church bureaucracy is actually larger and more complex than it was at the start of his tenure. Another failed goal: \" to launch the re-evangelization of europe \"; instead, sex-abuse scandals overtook the continent. After the charismatic, 26-year reign of john paul ii, benedict \" never had a chance, \" writes john moody for fox news. In contrast to john paul ii's popular brilliance and willingness to show off, \" benedict's meek initial outings were public relations meltdowns. \" other goals for the church — to \" expand its foothold in asia, cement its dominance in latin america, or make serious inroads in africa \" — went unachieved. But moody adds that benedict's willingness to resign shows both bravery and humility. \" for that he should be remembered. \" actually, benedict could end up with a legacy of dealing with the secular world in \" a remarkably liberal, if agonizingly slow, way, \" writes martin baccardax for the international business times. He notes that benedict made the first, tentative steps toward changing the church's views of contraception and criticized the church's response to its global child abuse scandal. ( hooper agrees that benedict's remarks on condoms \" could yet turn out to have been the most significant initiative of [ his ] papacy. \" ) but others aren't so willing to give benedict credit in those areas. The resignation presents a chance for the church to \" deal with sex-abuse victims more honestly, and to wake up and listen to the parishioners who have been widely ignoring church teaching for decades, \" writes michael tomasky in the daily beast. \" but i would imagine it's an opportunity the church won't take. \" click to see a list of five names being floated as the potential next pope.",

Under the code, fans are not allowed to be unruly, disruptive or perform illegal activities. They are also not allowed to get so drunk that they start causing problems for other fans. Foul, abusive language and obscene gestures are also prohibited. Fans are not allowed to interfere with the progress of the game. Fans are also not allowed to verbally or physically harass opposing team fans, stadium guests or staff members. Seahawks fans caught breaking the code will be required to complete a four hour online educational course centered on fan behavior before being allowed back to centurylink field. Fans will also have to pay the $ 75 cost of the course. \" we have great fans, \" seahawks president peter mcloughlin said in a statement. \" our goal is to ensure a safe environment for all in attendance, including visiting team fans. \" sports fans across the world seem to have trouble controlling themselves especially when you bring",
            "The san francisco 49ers take on the seahawks sunday at centurylink field by graham johnson undercover seattle police officers will wear san francisco 49ers jerseys at centurylink field for sunday's seahawks game to deter fan-on-fan violence. Taiwanese animators friday released a spoof of the new tactic ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lv-jwg9qpk&feature; =youtu.be ) which aims to deter unruly seahawks fans from assaulting san francisco fans. A kiro 7 investigation last winter revealed the problem of fan fights and assaults inside nfl stadiums. Greg skahill's face was bashed in when he was attacked on a stadium walkway while wearing a packers jersey. \" my eye i couldn't open the first night, my nose had to be rebroken the following week at harborview, \" skahill told kiro 7. The seahawks will use off-duty undercover officers inside the stadium. The seattle police department will do the same outside. \" the goal here is to get people to be on their best behavior, \" said seattle olice sgt. Sean whitcomb. The seahawks say any fans kicked out of the game will have to take a four-hour online behavior course at their own expense before being allowed back in the stadium. A team spokeswoman says since that program began, 50 fans have taken the course."

Bush administration, officials said that the embassy was being moved for security reasons. Officials say the new embassy was funded out of the sale of other properties in london, including the old embassy. Hours before trump's tweet, the guardian reported that trump had called off his visit to the uk out of fear of mass protests. Activists had vowed to protest trump's trip to london, and british politicians urged prime minister theresa may's government to call it off after trump tweeted anti-muslim videos from a british far-right group late last year. Cbs news reports that shortly before trump's thursday night tweet, white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders denied reports that the visit had been scrapped. \" the invitation was made and we accepted, \" she said. \" we are still finalizing dates for the state visit. \"",

Now, after months of what the washington post terms \" soul-searching at the private ivy league college, \" philip j. Hanlon today announced that students, even those who are 21, are barred from possessing or consuming hard alcohol on campus. The crackdown affects beverages that are 30 proof or above ( that's 15 %, notes the new york times, roughly the upper limit of most wine ). As for alcohol-related health problems, \" it is hard alcohol — rather than just beer or wine — that lands students on a hospital gurney, \" he said in a speech today. The post frames the new policy as tougher than the university of virginia's, which bans mixed punches and kegs. The wall street journal calls out two other universities to have made recent changes: brown has banned alcohol at frat parties, and swarthmore college's new policy includes a ban on both hard alcohol and drinking games. For now, hanlon sees no need to do away with frats and sororities, though he warns he wants to see \" meaningful, lasting reform \" in the next three to five years or he ' ll reconsider that position.

To avoid a chaotic greek default, european finance ministers have agreed to a $ 172 billion loan package. In return, the greek government has agreed to measures to cut its debt to 120.5 % of gdp by 2020, and to accept the \" enhanced and permanent \" presence of eu monitors overseeing its economy, reports the bbc. Greece's debt currently amounts to some 160 % of its gdp. Banks holding greek bonds have agreed to take an overall loss of close to 70 % of loaned money. The deal will save the eurozone from the knock-on effects of a greek default, and keep greece in the foreign currency. But the cuts in public spending involved are expected to worsen the country's recession, now in its fifth year, and reuters shares a glass-half-empty perspective: according to a \" deeply pessimistic \" report it obtained, international experts believe the deal will only assist with the country's most immediate debt problems. They paint a picture of an \" accident prone \" greece for years to come, and say more assistance will be needed if the country is expected to really cut its debt to the levels set by the bailout. And the financial times speaks to experts who insist that a eurozone exit is still likely for greece in 2012.",

The actor later blamed ex-wife kim basinger for releasing the voice recording to the public. According to radaronline, the rapper disowned son marquise and wrote him out of his will after the 16-year-old rejected a visit from him.

Jennifer aniston and her mother, nancy dow, had been estranged for more than a decade after dow gave an interview about their relationship in 1996.

But the secessionist sentiment that drove that petition is alive and well in texas, and it's kicking up something of a brouhaha. The new york times takes a look at the republic of texas — which is to say not the nation that existed for 10 years in the mid-1800s where the 28th state is now, but a group of \" harmless, clueless, and interesting... Generally nice older guys with too much time on their hands, \" in the words of a former land commissioner who's been on the receiving end of the group's \" amusing letters \" demanding he leave office. Group members are fond of minting their own currency, debating legislation, warning about foreign ( think: oklahoma ) intervention, and the like. Then came the group's valentine's day meeting, and things got a little hairy. The republic of texas had no sooner handed out roses to the ladies in attendance at the vfw in bryan when, as the houston chronicle reported at the time, in swept local cops, sheriff's officers, agents with the state da, texas rangers, and fbi.

Among those accusing authorities of overkill is the republic member who signed the summons: \" they came in looking like john dillinger and the gang were hiding out. \" feathers are decidedly ruffled, the group's profile has risen, and one member is demanding $ 3 million in money order or gold from a sheriff's investigator for \" trespass upon liberty. \" as for secession, says the group's president, \" we in the republic do not need to secede, because we never ceded it to them to start with. \"",

But that didn't stop carmen and shannon wampler-collins from obtaining their rowan county license this morning, making them the first same-sex couple to nab one since davis showed back up at the county clerk's office, cnn reports. As the couple filled out their paperwork, they were heckled by davis supporters who criticized them for their \" sin, \" the washington post reports. But when brian mason, the deputy clerk who agreed to issue the licenses, handed them their finished papers, gay rights supporters proclaimed, \" thank you, brian! \" a legal analyst tells cnn that the deputy's signature on the license may be valid without davis ' consent, per kentucky law, but that if the license was altered to remove her name and title, a court may have to rule on whether the document legally stands. ( maybe she passed this billboard on her way to work this morning. )",

            "New york ( cbsnewyork ) — a suspect was shot multiple times after an off-duty nypd detective was attacked with a meat cleaver in midtown on thursday afternoon and it all stemmed over a booted car. Nypd chief of department james o ' neill said two uniformed officers responded to a call to a possible crime in progress at 31st street and broadway around 5 p.m. When the officers arrived, they found the suspect — identified as 32-year-old akram joudeh of queens — trying to remove the boot from his car, officials said. Police said the man pulled out an 11-inch meat cleaver and fled the scene. According to o ' neill, officers pursued the suspect. Several other officers joined in the foot pursuit as joudeh ran toward 32nd street and seventh avenue. Nypd commissioner bill bratton said an off-duty police officer who was on his way home from court to penn station joined the pursuit and suffered a \"significant injury to his face \" after getting attacked with a meat cleaver. Police tried to corral the suspect, and even used a taser that had no effect on him. When the off-duty detective intervened and tried to grab him, he was struck in the head with the weapon. O ' neill said the detective suffered a six-inch gash from his temple to his jaw and was in serious condition at bellevue hospital center. Officers then fired 18 shots at the suspect.
