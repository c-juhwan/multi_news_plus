        "summary": "At least three people in florida have now died from a nasty warm-water bacteria called vibrio vulnificus this year, but the latest case should put people outside of florida on alert, too. That's because the victim contracted it while on vacation in mississippi, reports tampa's fox 13. Florida officials have warned people not to go swimming in the ocean with open wounds, even small cuts, and they also note that eating raw shellfish can trigger an infection. Those unfortunate enough to get one — florida saw 32 cases last year — can expect swelling, redness, and skin ulcers, but a florida health official notes that vibrio is \" not a flesh-eating bacteria, \" reports nwf daily news. Meanwhile, wtsp talks to the mother of an apparent fourth victim, a 26-year-old man who she says got vibrio after swimming near hernando county's pine island beach. \" i ' m not telling anyone don't go into the water, just do your due diligence and make sure that you're not going to harm yourself, \" says karen yeager.

        "summary": "The only thing more mysterious than the identity of the couple who stumbled upon an estimated $ 10 million in us gold coins while walking their dog on their california property: where did the gold come from? the san francisco chronicle floats a theory with all the intrigue and illegality you could hope for: historian/coin collector/fishing guide jack trout provided the paper with a passage from the bulletin of american iron and steel association that references a $ 30,000 turn-of-the-century gold heist from the san francisco mint that he believes is linked to the coins. Lending credence to the theory: the unearthed 1,427 gold coins, dated 1847 to 1894, were mostly uncirculated and in chronological order, suggesting they hadn't entered the public realm. And though they are worth millions today, their face value is $ 27,000, which roughly syncs with what was taken from the mint. Trout also points to the buried stash's 1866 liberty $ 20 gold piece not emblazoned with \" in god we trust \"; he suspects it was a private coin created by a mint manager that never left the mint. \" for it to show up as part of the treasure find links it directly \" to the mint heist, he says. But the couple's coin broker is no fan of the mint robbery theory, telling the chronicle he'd expect the haul would have included coins dated closer to the heist date. But a former sf mint detective sees it as plausible: \" downstairs, we had vaults where we kept old coins that hadn't been put into circulation. \" pjmedia further digs up a 1906 congressional report that indicates mint clerk w.n. Dimmick was convicted of the mint theft, but the document doesn't state whether dimmick revealed the coins ' location, or if they had been recovered. Abc news notes that if the coins are indeed purloined government property, the couple may owe uncle sam more than a heck of a lot in taxes: they may have to turn over the entire haul, and get a finder's fee in return.",

The details of the 1899 heist — $ 30,000 face value of uncirculated gold coins stolen from the san francisco mint in 1899 — matches every known fact about the gold coins found recently in the sierra foothills, which were nearly $ 30,000 in face value of uncirculated mint condition coins mostly made at the san francisco mint in the late 1800s. If, as is almost certainly the case, this explains the origin of the found coins, then the couple who found them will not merely have to pay taxes on them — they ' ll have to turn them over entirely back to the federal government, since the coins'status has changed from \"treasure trove \"",
            "A california couple who found a stash of buried gold coins valued at $ 10 million may not be so lucky after all. The coins may have been stolen from the u.s. Mint in 1900 and thus be the property of the government, according to a published report. The san francisco chronicle's website reported that a search of the haithi trust digital library provided by northern california fishing guide jack trout, who is also a historian and collector of rare coins, turned up the news of the theft. Watch: $ 10m gold coins may be linked to heist play the california couple, who have not been identified, spotted the edge of an old can on a path they had hiked many times before several months ago. Poking at the can was the first step in uncovering a buried treasure of rare coins estimated to be worth $ 10 million. \" it was like finding a hot potato, \" the couple told coin expert don kagin from kagin's, inc. The couple hired the president of kagin's, inc. And holabird-kagin americana, a western americana dealer and auctioneer, to represent them. The coins are mostly uncirculated and in mint condition, and they add up in face value to $ 27,000. \" those two facts are a match of the gold heist in 1900 from the san francisco mint"

Over the course of the president's first term, he has generally maintained the tiered approach as to which outlets ask the questions ( with the big 3 and associated press usually getting the green light ), although the president has departed from tradition on occasion - famously calling on a digital-only media outlet's reporter ( huffington post's sam stein ) during his first news conference in february 2009. But as for fox, these have been relatively lean years in terms of getting the presidential nod at news conferences, particularly in light of the news outlet's reach vis-à-vis some of the other media organizations which have received more questions. How lean? a smart politics analysis finds that abc reporters have been called on the most frequently during barack obama's solo news conferences followed by cbs, the",

Abc reporters have been called on 29 times, followed by cbs with 28, the ap with 27, nbc with 26, bloomberg with 20, reuters with 17, and the new york times and cnn tied with 16. Fox news ranks ninth with the president selecting the outlet 14 times for questions, according to the blog post titled \" fox still shunned at obama press conferences. \" still, fox news ranks higher than many other major publications. The president called on reporters from the washington post 11 times, usa today got 9 questions and the wall street journal got 8. Politico, meanwhile, was called on twice. As for individual reporters, the study found that obama called on nbc's chuck todd and former abc white house correspondent jake tapper the most — 23"

        "summary": "By 20 months of age, many infants are capable of a wide range of skills, from throwing a ball and using a toilet to stringing words together and finding objects. But researchers report in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that they now have evidence of babies doing more than gathering skills and knowledge — they're capable of something called metacognition, or as donald rumsfeld famously put it, they're aware that there are \" known unknowns. \" what's more, they turn to caregivers when they realize they don't have an answer for something — as the researchers write, \" they consciously experience their own uncertainty. \" to study this, researchers at the ecole normal superieure in paris developed a non-verbal memory test to get around the fact that most infants aren't yet verbalizing the inner workings of their minds. Gathering 80 parisian parents and their 20-month-olds, the researchers prompted the babies to remember the location of a toy hidden beneath one of two boxes after a three- to 12-second delay, reports the atlantic. Turns out they turned to their parents for help as the problem got harder — e.g., after a longer delay, or if hidden behind a curtain. And in doing so, they guessed correctly more often. \" children are capable of learning and questioning from an extremely young age, \" reports time. \" this means engaging the child, not just plonking him in front of a screen. It means that even when you're playing with your baby, he or she is learning about learning. \" ( check out why babies smile. )",

A disturbing nsfw clip recorded by a customer at a detroit mickey d's shows an employee working the drive-thru window, luring a homeless man he calls willie over by holding up a sandwich and saying, \" i ' m about to help you, \" then dousing him with a cup of water when willie approaches and reaches for the food. \" why'd you do that? \" a stunned willie asks before walking away.

Residents are outraged, with a local bishop telling the free press that the worker's actions were \" cruel, \" while the ceo of a nearby homeless center calls it \" unconscionable, \" adding, \" to me, it comes from a place of ignorance, not really having compassion for other people's plight. \" the director of the homeless action network of detroit agrees. \" i like to tell my staff that we're one missed paycheck away from homelessness, \" she tells the free press.

He was so scared, like a little frightened puppy, and he kept saying the obama phrase over and over, \" referring to rubio's reaction of christie's criticism during an earlier debate. Rubio: \" a tough guy? this guy inherited $ 200 million, he's never faced any struggle. \" christie: \" part of his talking points now is to be entertaining and smile a lot now, \" he said of rubio. \"listen, it's one act after another. \" rubio: he mocked trump for misspelling \" choker \" as \" chocker \" in an anti-rubio tweet. One problem? rubio said this: \" he spelled choker c-h-o-k-e-r. Chocker, \" accidentally spelling it correctly.

Researchers of the \"exoplanet-hunting \" group red dots have detected a planet — some 3.2 times the earth's mass and very cold — orbiting the star, smithsonian reports. Their findings were published in nature on wednesday. \"we firmly believe the object is there, \" says lead researcher ignasi ribas. \"we always have to remain a bit cautious … but we were sure enough that we were willing to go forward with publication. \" the planet, barnard's star b, is the second-closest exoplanet ( a planet outside of our solar system ) to earth, per usa today. Researchers looked at two decades worth of data from seven different telescopes to pick up the planet, according to forbes. As for the possibility of life on bernard's star b, the planet is \" way too cold \" to sustain liquid water, ribas says, and whether life may be frozen beneath an ocean is just speculation at this point. During the course of their study, smithsonian notes, researchers found faint evidence of another planet, which would be barnard's star c. Several decades ago, scientists believed that they had detected planets around the star. However, those ended up being the result of an instrument problem.

In his victory speech, poroshenko also said he would push for early parliamentary elections this year, a concession to yanukovych critics who said that replacing the president wasn't enough. But moscow doesn't hate the guy; poroshenko has business interests in russia, and has served in pro-russian governments before. Russia's foreign minister says russia is \" ready for dialogue \" with poroshenko, and that vladimir putin would respect the election results as the \" will of the ukrainian people, \" the bbc reports. Yet us senator kelly ayotte, who was in ukraine to observe the elections, accused russia of breaking its pledge not to interfere with the vote — separatists in the east largely prevented voting there. \" we know this was russia, \" ayotte said, calling for more sanctions.

( naturally, he didn't mention the us ' role in those attacks. ) rouhani, meanwhile, has been eschewing mahmoud ahmadinejad's anti-western bluster and holocaust denials — he even sent a tweet wishing jews a happy rosh hashanah.

Vienna &#124; vienna ( reuters ) - iran will cooperate with the u.n. Nuclear agency to find ways to \" overcome existing issues once and for all \", tehran's new envoy said on thursday, hinting at a more flexible approach under relatively moderate president hassan rouhani. But ambassador reza najafi, at his first board meeting of the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ), also repeated iran's stance that it would not cede what it calls its legitimate right to a peaceful nuclear energy program. \" based on its rights and obligations recognized under the npt ( non-proliferation treaty ), iran is ready to faithfully engage and remove any ambiguity on its nuclear activities, \" najafi told the 35-nation governing board of the iaea. Iran is at odds in particular with western powers, which fear its nuclear program is covertly directed at giving it the means to build nuclear bombs. Tehran denies this and rejects any limits on its enrichment of uranium or a more intrusive iaea inspection regime, sought in several u.n. Resolutions. Separately from big power diplomacy to resolve a decade-old dispute that could yet trigger a middle east war, the iaea has held"

We used heritrix ( 3.1.1-snapshot ) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives. The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites. However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed urls to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the urls for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl ( and therefore we never got to them ). We also included repeated crawls of some argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed. We have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available \"warts and all \" for people to experiment with. We have also done some further analysis of the content.

But the studies also lend credence to a broader idea: that our traditional way of defining cancer by the organ in which it originates is outdated, reports the new york times. Instead, it might be time to start thinking of cancer in terms of genetic mutations. In the latest studies, for example, researchers were surprised to discover that the worst endometrial tumors of the uterine were remarkably similar to the worst forms of breast and ovarian cancer. That raises \" the tantalizing possibility that the three deadly cancers might respond to the same drugs, \" writes the times ' gina kolata. This emerging approach is called \" precision medicine, \" notes the wall street journal.

The two studies of samples taken from hundreds of patients suggest new possible drug targets and ways to divide cancers into subtypes that might respond differently to treatment. The new data are the latest fruits of a major national effort to create an atlas of the dna blueprints of at least 20 types of cancer. Genomic data have been churned out in the past few years for five other cancers, and more are expected over the next year. While the results are being hailed as major technological and scientific feats that provide powerful insights into diseases in dire need of progress, they are just first steps toward the goals most patients and physicians care about: lengthening lives or curing cancer. Dana-farber cancer institute adult leukemia specialist dr. David steensma welcomed the new data, but also provided a bit of a reality check on how far the knowledge is from changing patient care, in an essay published in the new england journal of medicine called \"the beginning of the end of the beginning in cancer genomics. \" steensma argues that data-rich genome studies of cancer are a crucial",

Douglas levine of memorial sloan kettering cancer center, the principal investigator on the endometrial cancer study, said the group scoured the country for samples of this cancer. The cancer has long been evaluated by pathologists who examine thin slices of endometrial tumors under a microscope and put them in one of two broad categories. But the method is not ideal. In general, one category predicts a good prognosis and tumors that could be treated with surgery and radiation, while the other holds a poorer prognosis and requires chemotherapy after surgery. But pathologists often disagree about how to classify the tumors and can find it difficult to distinguish between the two types, dr. Levine said.

Dana-farber cancer institute adult leukemia specialist dr. David steensma welcomed the new data, but also provided a bit of a reality check on how far the knowledge is from changing patient care, in an essay published in the new england journal of medicine called \"the beginning of the end of the beginning in cancer genomics. \" steensma argues that data-rich genome studies of cancer are a crucial",
            "\"this is exploring the landscape of cancer genomics, \" said dr. David p. Steensma, a leukemia researcher at the dana-farber cancer institute who was not involved with the studies. \"many developments in medicine are about treatments or tests that are only useful for a certain period of time until something better comes by. But this is something that will be useful 200 years from now. This is a landmark that will stand the test of time. \" advertisement continue reading the main story dr. Douglas levine of memorial sloan kettering cancer center, the principal investigator on the endometrial cancer study, said the group scoured the country for samples of this cancer. The cancer has long been evaluated by pathologists who examine thin slices of endometrial tumors under a microscope and put them in one of two broad categories. But the method is not ideal. In general, one category predicts a good prognosis and tumors that could be treated with surgery and radiation, while the other holds a poorer prognosis and requires chemotherapy after surgery. But pathologists often disagree about how to classify the tumors and can find it difficult to distinguish between the two types, dr. Levine said. The new genetic analysis of hundreds of tumors found patterns of genetic aberrations that more"

More than 3,000 people watched thursday as mike parr, 73, descended a ladder into a 25-foot-square box under a road in hobart, australia, for a performance piece called \" underneath the bitumen the artist, \" the new york times reports. The confinement was billed as a memorial to victims of totalitarian violence and british colonialism in australia, notes abc news australia, but many assumed it was about local aboriginal tasmanian history being buried — particularly the 19th-century black war in which british settlers nearly wiped out indigenous tasmanians. And that sparked a few fighting words. \" it is a bit insulting, really, \" says tasmanian aboriginal center ceo heather sculthorpe, per pedestrian. \" if they have any interest in telling the aboriginal story then they should have put it out there for aboriginal people to do it. \" but an aboriginal activist called parr \" courageous \" and said that \" we support this bloke. \" meanwhile, parr sits below hobart traffic with his thermos and a microphone that lets his team monitor his breathing. The apparent risk is old hat for parr, who in past works has nailed his arm to a wall, sewn his mouth shut, and stayed in a glass cage for 10 days with only water to survive. But what if he never emerges from this one? \" i haven't thought of that, \" he says. \" no, no, no, i ' m coming out definitely. I have all sorts of performance plans. \" ( national geographic admits its past coverage of australian aboriginals and others has been racist. )",

        "summary": "Scientists at the university of virginia were able to control the brains of living mice using magnetic fields, essentially harnessing the power of mind control, according to a study published this week in nature neuroscience. Researchers created a synthetic gene — dubbed magneto, obviously — that is sensitive to magnetic fields and put it into a handful of mice, a university press release explains. Ars technica reports scientists then created a magnetic field to simulate a dopamine-like response in the genetically altered mice — basically the mice felt as happy as if they had just been given a treat. \"this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of bona fide magnetic control of the nervous system, \" ars technica quotes the researchers as saying. Until this newfound power is hijacked by a super villain, scientists hope to use it to study how the brain works and test out \" magneto-genetic \" therapies for people with brain disorders. Ali deniz güler, the study's lead author, called their results a \" dream tool. \" in the immediate future, researchers can use it to figure out what pathways in the brain do what in terms of feelings and behaviors, ieee spectrum reports. In the future, it could be used to control neural networks that aren't functioning properly, potentially treating conditions like schizophrenia and parkinson's disease. ( dogs apparently mastered magnetic fields long ago, using the one created by earth for pooping. )",

            "Photo: getty images advertisement matching the brain's machinery to behaviors and emotions was risky business throughout much of medical history. It was achievable, more or less, only through clumsy techniques such as lobotomies. Examiners who removed chunks of the brain could observe the surgery's effects, but patients had to live with the results. The rise of optogenetics, in which light in the form of lasers is used to manipulate individual neurons, has improved the situation slightly. But this technique still works only in regions of the brain where it's easy to shine light. Neuroscientists must physically insert a fiber optic cable to study anything that isn't easily accessible. Now a team from the university of virginia has shown that it's possible to use a magnet to control neurons embedded deep in the brains of mice. This technique could offer a non-invasive alternative to",

The generation of younger fans are glued to their cell phones, making it silly that mlb cracks down so hard on gifs and vines that make their product seem more appealing to a generation viewing everything through a smartphone screen. No one leaves home without their cell phone these days, and those phones are used to instantly create memories with a camera at sporting events and around everyday life. The older generation seems to think this is somehow detracting from the natural enjoyment of life and take the time to criticize the practice at seemingly every opportunity. It's a generational divide that comes across as bitter and superior. Couple that generational divide with a stereotype that young women are at games to be seen for instagram, or because their boyfriends dragged them there against their will instead of \" being a good fan \" by hanging on every pitch and you have the fuel for a mean-spirited rant.

            "Major league baseball has been extremely tone deaf when it comes to how its audience consumes its product. The generation of younger fans are glued to their cell phones, making it silly that mlb cracks down so hard on gifs and vines that make their product seem more appealing to a generation viewing everything through a smartphone screen. No one leaves home without their cell phone these days, and those phones are used to instantly create memories with a camera at sporting events and around everyday life. The older generation seems to think this is somehow detracting from the natural enjoyment of life and take the time to criticize the practice at seemingly every opportunity. It's a generational divide that comes across as bitter and superior. Couple that generational divide with a stereotype that young women are at games to be seen for instagram, or because their boyfriends dragged them there against their will instead of \" being a good fan \" by hanging on every pitch and you have the fuel for a mean-spirited rant.

Others knew him as \" the smoothest con man that ever lived \" and a \" top man in the modern world of crime. \" after all, he did sell the eiffel tower. And his counterfeit us banknotes were so authentic that authorities were concerned they could \" wobble international confidence in the dollar. \" but the true identity of lustig, who died of pneumonia in 1947 after a stint in alcatraz, may never be known, writes jeff maysh in his book handsome devil, an excerpt of which is in smithsonian. In 2015, a historian from lustig's purported hometown of hostinné ( in what is now the czech republic ) failed to find any evidence that \" the world's most flamboyant con man \" was ever born. Lustig, maysh writes, became a criminal early on, \" progressing from panhandler to pickpocket, to burglar, to street hustler. \" later, he moved to the us and graduated to bigger scams, making himself a millionaire in the process. Some highlights: lustig dressed well, was charming, and spoke five languages. He was no over-the-top \" bogus count, \" the new york times once wrote. After reading a newspaper article about the eiffel tower needing repairs in 1925, lustig passed himself off as a government official and convinced scrap metal dealers to bid on buying it. ( lustig got one payday off the scam and nearly pulled it off twice, notes todayifoundout. ) lustig, who traveled with a trunk of disguises, wrote the 10 commandments of the con, which included: \" never look bored, \" \" never boast, \" and \" never get drunk. \" it all came to an end in 1935 when lustig was arrested ( or re-arrested after escaping the \" inescapable \" federal detention center in manhattan ) on charges related to counterfeiting.

So adept was he at his craft, he even swindled al capone out of several thousand dollars during the roaring 20s and lived to tell about it. Lustig was born in czechoslovakia in 1890 when it was part of austria-hungary. Throughout his lifetime he had more than 45 aliases, and he spoke five languages fluently. Early in lustig's career he made his money by scamming wealthy tourists during trans-atlantic sailings between europe and the united states.

        "summary": "The navajo nation has been shaken by the nightmarish murder of an 11-year-old girl who was kidnapped along with her 9-year-old brother. Authorities say the body of ashlynne mike was found in a remote area near the shiprock monument in northwest new mexico on tuesday, the day after a stranger lured her and her brother into his van after school, the arizona republic reports. Her brother told authorities monday evening that the man walked into the hills with his sister and returned alone. He ran toward a highway when he saw the man coming back and was eventually picked up by somebody who took him to police. A frantic search for ashlynne followed. \" he was so tired and just crying and crying for his sister. It was really hard for the fbi to get any information from him, \" the boy's aunt tells the ap. On tuesday night, hours after the girl's body was found, the fbi announced that tom begaye, 27, had been arrested in connection with the murder. Relatives say the family did not know begaye, who allegedly tried to get other children into his van, saying he wanted to take them to a movie. Shawn mike, father of a boy who refused to get into the suspect's van, tells the albuquerque journal that the siblings lived with their father, gary. \" i just can't imagine what the individual said or did to lure them into the vehicle, \" he says. \" i know gary, he's a good father and taught his kids well. \" he says the horrific killing should teach the community two things: \" i think it's really important to remind our children everywhere not to talk to strangers, \" he says. \" and most importantly to tell them that we love them. \"",

Loudspeakers have been used by both sides as propaganda producers along the border, although the south's are said to be much louder and more powerful than the north's. Using the speakers to tamp down the cult of personality around north korean leader kim jong un has been a main goal of the south; one tactic both sides engage in is to use the speakers to try to cajole soldiers to cross over to the other side. Although the speakers were muffled after the first summit in 2000, they were plugged back in as the relationship between the two nations worsened, a deterioration exacerbated by the north's nuclear tests. South korean officials say the north is expected to also turn off its loudspeakers as a gesture of goodwill this time around.

Google said that social circle in fact allows gmail users to make social connections based on public information and private connections across its products in ways that don't skirt privacy.

Confronted with evidence, a facebook spokesman last night confirmed that facebook hired burson, citing two reasons: first, it believes google is doing some things in social networking",
            "Google deflects pr firm's attack of gmail privacy it's not as if google lacks privacy controversies to quell. Yet burson-marsteller, a top-five public relations firm, is attempting to pile more on. Burson last week stepped up a whisper campaign to get top-tier media outlets, including usa today, to run news stories and editorials about how an obscure google gmail feature — social circle — ostensibly tramples the privacy of millions of americans and violates federal fair trade rules. Google said that social circle in fact allows gmail users to make social connections based on public information and private connections across its products in ways that don't skirt privacy.

But there was no \" antwan \" in a white toyota camry with dreadlocks and gold teeth, according to police, who arrested 21-year-old stinson on first-degree murder charges tuesday, reports the new york times. Hours after stinson told spectrum news she was \" a damn good mom, \" the body of jordan belliveau was discovered in a wooded area behind a baseball field in largo, fla., and police say his pregnant mother admitted to putting him there, per the tampa bay times. Stinson said she struck the boy in the face, causing his head to hit a wall, \" during a moment of frustration \" after an \" unexplained, serious injury \" to his right leg, per an arrest affidavit. After the boy suffered repeated seizures, stinson brought him to the wooded area sunday and departed without him, police say. Describing stinson as a \" struggling single mother, \" police on monday had noted that bloody items in her apartment might've been from an accident that required jordan to get stitches. Despite that, \" we honestly knew it was her because of her past with us, \" an uncle of the boy tells fox 13. Per spectrum news, jordan was put in foster care at 3 months old but returned to stinson in may. An autopsy of the boy is scheduled for wednesday.",

At least, that is, according to a study that finds we should take 17-minute breaks after every 52 minutes of work. The idea, the muse reports, is to treat those 52-minute work periods \" as sprints, \" while during the breaks, \" we're talking completely dedicating yourself to not working, \" julia gifford writes. Her team used an app called desktime, which keeps track of what workers are doing, to determine the habits of the highest-achieving 10 % of employees studied. Researchers have long said that the human brain isn't designed for eight straight hours of focusing, fast company reports. And sitting for eight hours isn't good for us either, the muse notes. Instead, we should take breaks — and actually get away from our computers, perhaps taking a walk, talking with coworkers, or getting a healthy snack. If your boss isn't cool with 17-minute breaks, 5- or 10-minute breaks could be helpful, too, gifford writes. ( speaking of all that sitting, here's how to walk back the damage it's doing. )",

Putin signed a pardon that allowed for khodorkovsky's release today on the basis of \" the principles of humanity, \" reports the bbc, which confirms khodorkovsky left prison after eating lunch. Putin's foes have long held up khodorkovsky's prosecution and imprisonment as examples of his abuse of power. ( the bbc has a profile of khodorkovsky here. ) yesterday, putin said he'd never freed him because until now, he hadn't asked, the bbc reports. \" he has already been in detention more than 10 years, this is a serious punishment, \" putin pointed out. \" he is referring to humanitarian circumstances as his mother is ill. \" but khodorkovsky, his mother, and his lawyers all denied that he'd requested the pardon, reuters reports, and he had previously said that such a request would essentially be an admission of guilt. The initial news came a day after russia's lower house passed an amnesty bill that could free as many as 25,000 prisoners — possibly including the jailed pussy rioters and greenpeace protesters, the new york times reports. Both moves are widely seen as attempts to deflect international criticism ahead of the sochi olympics. Khodorkovsky's release is also \" good for the investor perception of russia, \" one analyst told bloomberg, and indeed russian stocks rose 1.3 % on the initial news.",

But what's obscured by the thick foliage, revealed for the first time, is evidence of a sprawling civilization to rival ancient greece or china. Using lidar technology ( light detection and ranging ), which measures wavelengths from laser pulses aimed at the ground, scientists digitally removed the jungle to reveal more than 60,000 previously unknown mayan structures like palaces, fortifications, farms, irrigation systems, and raised highways connecting nearly all ancient cities across 800 square miles in northern guatemala, report live science and national geographic. \" we ' ll need 100 years to go through all [ the data ] and really understand what we're seeing, \" says researcher francisco estrada-belli. But already it's apparent that the civilization has been \" grossly underestimated, \" says archaeologist thomas garrison. The new data show a civilization twice the size of medieval england at its peak 1,200 years ago. And though population estimates previously hovered around 5 million, expansive irrigation and terracing systems and wide highways indicate there might've been \" 10 to 15 million people there — including many living in low-lying, swampy areas that many of us had thought uninhabitable, \" estrada-belli says. Walls, fortresses, and ramparts also suggest war was \" large-scale and systematic \" and \" endured over many years \" not just \" toward the end of the civilization, \" says garrison. One of the coolest discoveries, however, was a 100-foot pyramid in the heart of the city of tikal, which was previously assumed to be a small mountain, reports reuters.

Vice president jorge glas later that at least 235 were confirmed dead, with another 1,557 injured, reports the ap. He said there were deaths in the cities of manta, portoviejo, and guayaquil — all several hundred miles from where the quake struck shortly after nightfall.

He said looting had broken out but authorities were too busy trying to save lives to re-establish order, reports the ap. \" this wasn't just a house that collapsed, it was an entire town, \" he said. President rafael correa declared a national emergency and rushed home from a visit to rome. Ecuador's risk management agency said 10,000 armed forces had been deployed. The usgs originally put the quake at a magnitude of 7.4 then raised it to 7.8. It had a depth of 12 miles. At least 36 aftershocks followed, one as strong as 6 on the richter scale, and authorities urged residents to brace for even stronger ones in the coming hours and days.",

The note stated there were bombs in four buildings on campus, and, per necn, a senior vp at the school says the message made reference to the school custodial staff.

Among them: despite former top afghanistan adviser richard holbrooke's expertise on ending wars — he played a role in peace deals for vietnam and yugoslavia — other aides couldn't stand to have him around, in large part thanks to a personality that included a \" thirst for the spotlight, \" chandrasekaran writes in an excerpt printed in the washington post. Other top advisers went out of their way to sideline him — even attempting to fire him, a move halted by hillary clinton — as he pushed for a negotiated solution to the conflict. The \" staggering cost, \" according to the author: \" the obama white house failed to aggressively explore negotiations to end the war when it had the most boots on the battlefield. \" elsewhere, the book takes issue with obama's troop surge, revealing that the president intentionally skipped over a cia memo suggesting the 30,000 extra troops hadn't provided much improvement on the ground, according to the ap.

On wednesday, with tens of thousands of votes still uncounted, gillum tweeted, \"i ' m looking forward to seeing every vote counted, \" per the tallahassee democrat. Although, as nbc notes, he has not explicitly requested a recount, gillum did say thursday that his campaign is prepared for one. As of late afternoon local time, republican ron desantis held a lead of 38,613 votes, per the ap, which is a margin of 0.47 %. If desantis ' lead remains below 0.5 percentage points when the first unofficial count is verified on saturday, a mandatory recount will be triggered. And state officials appear to be preparing for that possibility ( a recount in a florida senate race also is anticipated ). \"the recounts will be nationally watched, \" secretary of state ken detzner reportedly told election supervisors during a morning conference call, adding that florida will be \"under a microscope. \" speaking via facebook live on thursday, gillum said, \"this is extremely hard. But, you know what, the fight for progress, the fight for change, the fight for what it is we want, it's hard. \" as for desantis, he told reporters, per the tampa bay times, that he is \"looking forward to serving, \" adding, \"we ' ll let the lawyers do what they got to do, but we're good.

That ring was the only belonging bulger fought with authorities to keep. But the auction also included more mundane items, reuters reports. A punching bag, a floor safe, books on wwii with bulger's handwritten notes, and a collection of sneakers ( \" you can walk in whitey's shoes, \" says the auctioneer ). A \" lumpy old couch \" was bought for $ 35. Left out of the auction were bulger's toiletries, underwear, and nazi memorabilia.

University of central missouri mathematician curtis cooper has discovered the biggest prime number yet, a 17 million-digit behemoth, as part of gimps. The project uses a huge network of volunteer computers as part of the search for mersenne primes, a rare type of prime number first noted in the 17th century. The number — 2 raised to the power of 57,885,161 minus 1 — is more than 4 million digits longer than the previous record holder, which was found in 2008, livescience adds. So what is the giant number good for? large primes can be used for online encryption, but mathematicians say it's mostly about the thrill of the hunt. \" people enjoy it for the challenge of the discovery of finding something that's never been known before, \" the computer scientist who created gimps says. Cooper also wins $ 3,000 for the discovery, but a bigger payday looms.

Over the past couple of weeks, he's likened ted cruz to lucifer and bragged about the house gop's victory against obamacare, and now he's moved on to his next target: hillary clinton. Speaking thursday at the salt investment conference in las vegas, boehner touched on the fbi's probe into clinton's private email server and made mention of a possible alternative for the democrats if clinton has to drop out of the presidential race, the hill reports. \" boehner says he ' would not be surprised at all ' if clinton ' has to withdraw ' and [ joe ] biden ' parachutes in, ' \" tweeted cnn correspondent phil mattingly, whose twitter timeline was filled with plenty of other juicy boehner quotes from the salt speech. Boehner was on a rip-roaring roll, dissing bernie sanders ( \" he's an old curmudgeon \" ), elizabeth warren ( \" i don't need a nightmare while i ' m awake \" ), and, naturally, ted cruz ( \" thank god the guy from texas didn't win \" ). He also begrudgingly threw his support behind donald trump, noting trump is the presumptive gop nominee \" whether people like [ it ] or not, \" even though he conceded he doesn't agree with trump on much policy-wise. \" anybody who doesn't think donald trump can win, just watch, \" he warned, shortly after he took a long, awkward pause when asked why current speaker paul ryan would want trump as the nominee. But despite his loquaciousness, boehner is still glad he's out of the fray. \" every day i read the news, i ' m [ reminded ] of how happy i am that i ' m not in the chaos, \" he said.",

        "summary": "In what some are calling one sign of an improving economy, if at the expense of newlyweds, a new survey by the knot finds that the average cost of a us wedding jumped to $ 31,213 last year, marking a five-year high when adjusted for inflation. In its eighth report, the wedding site reveals in a press release that when it came to the 16,000 brides and grooms married in 2014 and then surveyed, most couples split that bill evenly with the bride's parents: on average, each footed 43 % of the bill, with the groom's parents chipping in 12 %. In fact, only 12 % of couples paid for their weddings themselves. And sticking to the budget is apparently tough: 45 % of couples didn't manage to do so ( another 23 % didn't even make a budget ). As for the dress, brides spent an average $ 1,357. The survey also found that the most expensive place to wed was manhattan, where the average price tag was $ 76,328 ( which is actually down almost $ 10,000 from the previous year ), while the least expensive was utah, where weddings cost less than half the national average at $ 15,257. Couples are spending more per head, too, as the average guest list shrunk from 149 in 2009 to 136 in 2014. On the subject of marriage and money, according to a february redfin survey, 38 % of millennials say they have or intend to put off marrying so they can afford to buy a home, reports bloomberg business. Marketwatch notes the average wedding price happens to be $ 92 less than a 15 % down payment on a $ 208,700 home — the country's median price last quarter.

His first swing at the 300-pound-plus beast hit it in the teeth, and the bear retaliated with scratches across nelson's chest and face. Nelson, who the guardian says is a former featherweight boxer and bear hunter, combined both skill sets to anticipate the bear's next move. \" i knew it would swing first with its left, but it would really come with its right, because most bears are right-handed, \" he tells the cbc. And nelson's second punch was spot-on, nailing the bear right in the snout. It was at that point the cub let out another sound and, either bored of the fight or frightened, started leaving the scene. As nelson held his breath, the bloodied mother bear decided to follow her baby instead of bringing nelson back to the mat. His wife, sheryl, tells the sudbury star that when nelson — who's since been nicknamed \" kung fu panda \" by his co-workers — and the bear both retreated, \" it was like two warriors backing away from the battle. \" nelson, meanwhile, concedes, \" i really lucked out there, \" adding that black bears really aren't that dangerous unless you mess with their cubs.

After several swings from mr nelson, the bear walked away from the fight with a bloody nose. Mr nelson said: \" it just turned back around and walked away like nothing ever happened and followed the cub. So i really lucked out there. \" despite his encounter, mr nelson told a canadian broadcaster that he did not want people to fear black bears. The government of ontario says black bears usually avoid contact with humans."

For example, socially contingent media ( ie, with appropriate content, timing, and intensity ) such as videophone apps are just as effective as real-life encounters in teaching language to 24 month olds,3 but otherwise, published research on whether infants and toddlers can learn from interactive screens is scant.

        "summary": "The ebola outbreak that's claimed at least 500 lives in west africa may have been lurking a while before going on its killing spree, nbc news reports. Researchers figured this by studying blood samples from old cases of viral illnesses in liberia, sierra leone, and guinea, and finding possible signs of ebola. The results aren't 100 % — the samples were old, after all — but evidence suggests that an ebola outbreak could be spotted ahead of time. \" it makes us realize that you don't have to see an outbreak \" to know it's there, said randal schoepp, a us army researcher. \" in africa, it is easy for a disease to smolder because there is so much disease. \" this is ebola's first outbreak in west africa, but other dangerous diseases like dengue, malaria, and particularly lassa fever are common there. Lassa fever also comes with ebola-like symptoms such as internal and external bleeding, vomiting, and high fever. Analyzing 253 blood samples from 2006 to 2008, schoepp's crew found that almost 9 % of samples cleared of other ailments tested positive for ebola antibodies.

Now a new study suggests walking into a mall while hungry is just as bad — at least for your wallet. The study's title sums up the finding: \" hunger promotes acquisition of nonfood objects. \" reporting in the journal pnas, researchers at the university of minnesota say they conducted five experiments whose results consistently showed an increase in the desire to acquire things when people reported being hungry. In one experiment where the items ( in this case, binder clips ) were free, the hungry cohort left with 70 % more than satiated participants. And even when people had to pay ( this time for department store items ), the hungry ones spent 64 % more. \" it's probably better to feed yourself before any type of shopping, whether you're going on an actual shopping trip or shopping online, \" researcher alison jing xu tells smithsonian. \" and if you're really hungry, you'd better think twice before purchasing any items at all or you might regret those purchases later. \" ( the study notes that \" hunger does not influence how much they like nonfood objects. \" ) new scientist reports xu was inspired by a shopping trip of her own, during which she bought 10 pairs of tights on an empty stomach, \" not just the two i needed. \" she says ghrelin, a hormone released by the stomach that makes people seek out food, may also affect other behaviors.

Peinovich, who often discussed killing jewish people, denied the report to salon before confirming it on the trs forum. He then resigned. As several others involved in trs were outed recently, mic reports its future is now unclear, though national policy institute head richard spencer says peinovich \" will continue to be a force on the alt-right in the future, \" per the guardian. The revelation came less than a month after a former alt-right vlogger described a major alt-right player as \" married to a jewish woman, \" without naming names. Peinovich's wife appeared on the daily shoah podcast numerous times. In one 2015 episode, she read a neo-nazi parody of the night before christmas of which she was \" very proud, \" peinovich said at the time. If her jewish heritage \" makes you want to leave the movement, or to have nothing to do with trs, then i understand, \" peinovich wrote on the trs forum this week. The response from the movement was less than understanding, with one user suggesting the pair were \" actors in the same play being orchestrated by the jews, \" while other memes showed peinovich and his wife in gas chambers.",

Now that they're in their 70s and trying to sell it, however, \" it stresses everyone out, \" brian tells the ap. Their home is known by locals as the old stone store and was built by a merchant who wanted to sell to farmers in vermont and quebec. There are entrances on both sides of the border, and a small granite border marker just outside the front door. Derby, vermont, is on one side; stanstead, quebec, on the other. The house comes with granite walls, 1950s decor, and a whopping 7,000 square feet of living space divided into five currently vacant apartments, and is listed for a relatively low $ 109,000, per zillow. The ap cites a renovation estimate of $ 600,000, though it doesn't provide specifics. Of note: the new owners will have to be ok with border security agents keeping track of their whereabouts. Mashable goes so far as to call this a \" bonus \" considering it results in \" armed 24-hour security from two powerful nations! \" dumoulin admits that there is a certain \" awkwardness \" to the house's location, because \" you can't just go this way or that way. \" that said, if it's always been a dream to live in two countries simultaneously, this house has exactly what you want.

        "summary": "\" this is really momentous, bigger than recovering the bald eagle, \" an environmental writer tells the christian science monitor after the us fish and wildlife service on thursday proposed removing grizzly bears in and around yellowstone from the endangered species list. When grizzlies were added to the list in 1975, there were just 136 bears remaining in the greater yellowstone ecosystem ( which includes both the park and surrounding lands ) as a result of hunting. Today, there are an estimated 700 to 1,000 bears. \" there is robust agreement that this population has recovered, \" service director dan ashe says. \" it's now our obligation to delist the population and return management to the state. \" a final decision is expected later this year, reports reuters. Grizzlies have also doubled their range to occupy more than 22,500 square miles of the yellowstone region, but wildlife advocates fear they're still at risk. A record 59 yellowstone grizzlies died last year as food sources, including white bark pine and cutthroat trout, dwindled. The proposal comes \" a couple years too early, \" says one advocate, who fears that wyoming, idaho, and montana will resume grizzly hunts, not held since 1974, on bears who stray beyond the park's boundaries. A scientist with the national resources defense council tells cnn that the bears could see genetic problems if they don't interact with bears outside the greater yellowstone ecosystem. Ashe says a five-year plan will be put in place to \" ensure healthy grizzly populations persist across the yellowstone ecosystem long into the future. \"",

President obama and german chancellor angela merkel held a joint press conference this morning at the white house, declaring that russian aggression against ukraine has only strengthened the resolve of europe and the us to work toward a resolution, the ap reports. \" we are in absolute agreement that the 21st century cannot have us stand idle and allow the borders of europe to be redrawn by the barrel of a gun, \" obama said, per usa today. The sticking point between the two countries lies in what obama calls \" tactical disagreements \": whether or not to send lethal aid to ukraine. The us has so far only provided ukraine with non-lethal assistance. Merkel — who, along with french president francois hollande, met with vladimir putin and ukrainian president petro poroshenko last week and is scheduled to meet with them again wednesday — doesn't believe arming ukraine is wise. Although obama noted that putin has \" violated just about every commitment \" in striving for a peaceful solution, merkel said the \" progress that ukraine needs cannot be achieved with more weapons, \" per cnn; she added she fears russia could increase military action if that happens.

        "summary": "To conceive identical triplets with fertility drugs, or to spontaneously conceive fraternal triplets, is not necessarily headline-worthy. But \" to have a patient with spontaneous identical triplets is incredibly rare, \" says a doctor who recently delivered a set of such triplets — and puts the odds at about one in a million. Jody and jase kinsey of miles city, mont., knew that multiples were a possibility — jase's dad was a twin — but they weren't expecting to hear, from the tech at their first ultrasound, that there appeared to be three babies in there. They soon ended up under the care of the aforementioned specialist, dr. Dana damron, and jody gave birth to sons cade, ian, and milo on dec. 5, the billings gazette reports. Jody, 30, and jase, 29, were already parents to son jax, 6. \" with them being identical, they all shared the same placenta so there could be possible complications, \" jody explains; damron kept a close watch to make sure all the babies were growing equally. Jody stopped working in september and was admitted to the clinic with early signs of labor in november, but ultimately the babies waited until 32 weeks — about the average gestational age for triplets, according to damron. They were born via c-section between 3 pounds, 11 ounces and 4 pounds, 1 ounce, and all were \" in excellent condition, \" he adds. Cade has been released from the hospital, but doctors want milo and ian to get a little better at eating first. Interestingly, another set of spontaneous identical triplets was born on new year's eve in minnesota to terri and peter pazdernik, people reports. These three are girls, named hannah, natalie, and elise. ( more identical triplets here and here. Even crazier? this story of identical quadruplets conceived naturally. )",

The result: the group has basically disowned him. Though joined by tinder's communications vp — who cut him off at one point, noting \" that's it! we're going to be fired \" — the 29-year-old delivered some uncomfortable lines, including when trying to describe himself as sapiosexual, or someone who finds intelligence the most attractive quality. Rad accidentally threw out the word \" sodomy, \" then had to google what it meant. \" what? no, not that. That's definitely not me. Oh, my god, \" he then clarified. Rad went on to say he doesn't approve of penis pictures and has slept with 20 women, per re/code. That led him to brag that a \" really, really famous \" supermodel has been \" begging \" him for sex. \" she's one of the most beautiful women i've ever seen but it doesn't mean that i want to rip her clothes off and have sex with her, \" he said. It wasn't just rad that seemed odd. The interview itself was surprising since most companies keep quiet ahead of an ipo. Match group's statement on the interview, however, explains all: \" mr. Rad is not a director or executive officer of the company, \" it states in a new filing. \" the article was not approved or condoned by, and the content of the article was not reviewed by, the company or any of its affiliates. \" rad's comments aside, reuters notes that match group's shares were up as much as 12.5 % in their ipo wednesday morning.",

        "summary": "The way you don't expect a wedding reception to be described: \" i ' m telling you, there was blood everywhere. There was holes punched in the walls. \" but that's exactly what transpired at a saturday reception outside buffalo, ny, according to an unidentified worker at the orchard park country club. The buffalo news reports that seven police agencies were called to the scene after a massive fight broke out just after 11pm, as the reception ended and guests were readying to go home. \" things were said that can never be taken back, \" says one witness; the paper reports that family members were yelling of their hatred for each other. The worker says about 200 people attended the reception, and wivb reports that an arriving officer saw at least 100 people fighting. The bride and groom reportedly weren't among them: she was taken to a back patio, while her new husband stayed inside and attempted to get his guests to exit. One man received stitches for a head injury, and a few others were treated on the scene. No arrests were made, and while the state liquor authority has opened an investigation into what transpired, police tell the news that criminal charges are unlikely. As for what caused the fracas, the police chief doesn't seem to know: \" it could be someone was touched inappropriately. It could be a family issue. It could be an emotional issue. \" and someone actually was touched inappropriately, allegedly by a member of the wedding party who was then punched; police were previously called at 10: 18pm to deal with that. ( this fight seems small compared to one that happened this summer at a nj wedding. )",
