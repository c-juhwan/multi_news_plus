        "summary": "Yesterday marked the 69th anniversary of auschwitz's liberation, and the new york times marks the solemn occasion with a look at a less widely known fact about the holocaust: at least 2 million of the 6 million jews who were killed died not at auschwitz or any other concentration camp. Instead, they perished in what some call a \" holocaust by bullets \" — executions that occurred at thousands of eastern european killing sites as mundane as forests, fields, and homes, the bodies deposited into unmarked mass graves. It's a side to the holocaust that only started to emerge after the fall of the soviet union, as records and witness accounts slowly became available. The bulk of the killing — in places like belarus, ukraine, and russia — began after the june 1941 nazi invasion of the soviet union. \" the further east the wehrmacht went, the greater the killing, \" says an austrian history professor who calls the executions \" in a sense, invisible. \" the rare survivors were \" terrorized and silenced \" and in many cases \" left behind the iron curtain, \" writes alison smale for the times. To wit, a french priest who has spent a dozen years searching for witnesses, now with the help of 23 employees, says 90 % of those interviewed have never discussed their experience before. In a 2009 interview with the ap, rev. Patrick desbois said his work had led him to more than 800 mass extermination sites, the bulk of which had been unidentified. He also uncovered horror upon horror: local children who were forced to bury the dead, and sadistic killings that went beyond firing squads, like throwing jews alive onto bonfires or into wells.

The desert sun reports riverside county judge emma smith has barred the parents from any attempts at communication with their children, including electronically or by phone, per the washington post, until january 2021. They're also prohibited from coming within 100 yards of any of their children — whom they're accused of shackling, starving, and abusing — except in the course of a court hearing. The only contact that's permitted is via their lawyer. A separate desert sun piece highlights the recollections of taha muntajibuddin, who attended third grade in forth worth, texas, with one of the eldest turpin girls — and now feels \" an overwhelming sense of guilt and shame. \" in a facebook post, muntajibuddin writes the girl was the butt of ceaseless jokes and mockery for smelling like mud and worse. She was the \" cootie kid, \" and he recalls the day the whole class teased her after the teacher made her throw out a hair tie she had fashioned out of the \" discarded tin foil wrapper from an old hershey's bar. \" he says that years later, he searched for her online, imagining that \" somewhere, somehow, [ she ] was probably living her best life...

When the 24-year-old died last week — his sister posted the news on his now-defunct daveonwheels blog — the obituary got picked up around the nation and even the world. And now it all turns out to be a hoax, reports the huffington post. This skeptical blogger first exposed the ruse, and thechive and betabeat have more details on the rise and fall of the fictional david rose. His still-anonymous creator has apologized, saying he didn't intend to profit from the blog and never dreamed it would get the attention it did. \" david was just a character, a part of my psyche, \" he writes, and the intent was to inspire people to live better lives. He also apologized to virginia's hunter dunn, the real paraplegic whose photos he stole and passed off as david rose. \" there is no conspiracy here, just a guy with a twisted psyche who realizes he's caused a lot of damage and now needs to try to figure out how he's going to live with himself. \" click for more.",

Bizarrely, julia biryukova and the father of 2-year-old sky were cited just over a year ago for also leaving the boy alone in the family car. This time, biryukova told investigators she suddenly ran out of gas on a bellevue street close to a highway. So she took her 4-year-old daughter to walk to a gas station, leaving sky in her unlocked silver acura. She called a friend for a ride back to the car from the gas station, and sky was gone, biryukova told investigators. A gas can wasn't found in biryukova's car, a detail that \" could mean a lot of things, \" a police spokeswoman told abc. Police have searched the woods near the car, and are now hunting for the boy near his mother's home. Biryukova and sky's dad, solomon metalwala, pleaded guilty last year to leaving the boy alone in the family car when he was just 3 months old as the parents shopped. The baby was alone for 55 minutes on a 27-degree day, and the parents only returned when police located them after a call from a concerned passer-by. The parents are currently in the midst of a bitter custody battle. Biryukova filed for an order of protection against her husband for herself and her two children last year, reports ap. He dragged and kicked her in an incident she recounted in her court documents. \" i live in constant fear for my life and my children's life, \" she said in the documents. Metalwala has claimed biryukova has mental health issues.",

            "Pools of water on the floor and old, hard-to-clean equipment at a colorado farm's cantaloupe-packing facility were probably to blame for the deadliest outbreak of foodborne illness in 25 years, the food and drug administration said wednesday. Government investigators found positive samples of listeria bacteria on equipment in the jensen farms packing facility and on fruit that had been held there. In a six-page assessment of the conditions at the farm based on investigators ' visits in september, the fda said jensen farms had recently purchased used equipment that was corroded, dirty and hard to clean. The packing facility floors were also constructed so they were hard to clean, so pools of water potentially harboring the bacteria formed close to the packing equipment. The dirty equipment _ purchased in july, the same month the outbreak started _ was previously used to wash and dry potatoes, the agency said, and the listeria \" could have been introduced as a result of past use of the equipment, \" according to the report. Fda officials said that they are not concerned about similar listeria contamination in the potatoes that were previously processed on the equipment because those vegetables are rarely eaten raw. Cooking can kill the bacteria. A warning letter from the agency to jensen farms said that a third of 39 swabs taken throughout the facility tested positive for listeria. \" this significant",
            "Federal health officials say they found listeria throughout the packing facility of the colorado farm whose cantaloupe have so far caused 25 deaths and more than 125 illnesses. In a report released wednesday, the food and drug administration cited multiple problems at the jensen farms facility in holly, colo., some of which could suggest how listeria came to enter the farm's packing shed. For instance, fda officials said, a truck used to take waste cantaloupes to a nearby cattle farm was parked next to the open-air packing shed. Because cattle are known carriers of the listeria bacteria, manure carried on the truck's wheels could have contaminated the area around the packing facility. Other problems found included: •equipment used to wash and dry the cantaloupe was impossible to clean thoroughly and had built-up dirt on it. •a refrigerator drain line allowed water to pool on the floor next to the packing equipment. •the floor of the packing shed was constructed such that it was very difficult to clean. •the company had purchased a used potato-washing machine to clean its cantaloupes, which may have been another way that listeria was introduced to the facility. •the cantaloupe, which typically come in from the fields at 80 degrees, were not pre-cooled to inhibit bacteria growth before being placed in cold storage.

Trump's response on monday was essentially: bring it on. \" i hope john brennan, the worst cia director in our country's history, brings a lawsuit, \" the president tweeted. \" it will then be very easy to get all of his records, texts, emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did, but how he was involved with the mueller rigged witch hunt. He won't sue! \" rudy giuliani had earlier expressed a similar sentiment, saying he'd love to get brennan under oath so that everyone can find out \" what a terrible job he did. \" trump posted a second tweet on the subject of brennan: \" everybody wants to keep their security clearance, it's worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect brennan. It certainly isn't because of the good job he did! he is a political ' hack. ' \" the hill reports it's likely that a suit would expose trump, not brennan, to risk, and quotes national security lawyer mark zaid's tweet to back that up: \" you, or whomever occasionally [ sic ] tweeting for you, have zero clue how this legal process works. First, you have @johnbrennan govt info already.... Second, likely discovery, if any, only against you. Third, he'd win on process. I'd rep him in heartbeat. \"",

        "summary": "President obama will want to keep the latest issue of rolling stone handy to counter reports of his down-in-the-dumps approval ratings. The cover story is by economist and new york times pundit paul krugman, and its headline of \" in defense of obama \" might understate things. Consider this line: \"despite bitter opposition, despite having come close to self-inflicted disaster, obama has emerged as one of the most consequential and, yes, successful presidents in american history, \" krugman writes. The nobel winner runs through obama's accomplishments, declaring, for example, that obamacare is flawed \" but still a huge step forward — and it's working better than anyone expected. \" he thinks that financial reform out of the obama white hasn't been aggressive enough, \" but it's much more effective than you'd think. \" and his \" environmental policy is starting to look like it could be a major legacy. \" it's not all praise — krugman criticizes the president on his \" surveillance state \" policies, for example — but he thinks obama has accomplished the ultimate goal of any president: he's changed the country for the better, and he's done so despite inheriting a mess and facing entrenched opposition. \" i don't care about the fact that obama hasn't lived up to the golden dreams of 2008, and i care even less about his approval rating, \" writes krugman. \" i do care that he has, when all is said and done, achieved a lot. That is, as joe biden didn't quite say, a big deal. \" click to read his full piece. Or see critiques of it as \" a little perfunctory \" and \" light on details \" at slate or \" embarrassingly fawning \" at the washington post. Either way, it makes a notable turnaround for krugman, who was arguably once the president's strongest liberal critic, writes arit john at bloomberg.",

Campaign manager jeff weaver tells cnn that around 200 staffers are being laid off, bringing the team down to between 325 to 350, though he says there were once more than 1,000 people on staff and that downsizing is part of the \" natural evolution of every campaign \" as the primary process nears its end.

Now a pilot study out of the london school of hygiene &amp; tropical medicine suggests that our genes dictate whether mosquitoes are attracted to us, researchers report in the journal plos one. It's already thought that the scent of our skin is behind the attraction or aversion, but this small study suggests that genes control this. \" if we could work out which genes are involved, we could develop new repellents, \" the lead researcher tells npr. The researchers had 18 sets of identical female twins ( they are genetically identical ) and 19 sets of non-identical female twins ( they are no more genetically similar than ordinary siblings ) stick their hands in a y-shaped plexiglass tube filled with 20 mosquitoes. \" twins that were identical were very similar in their level of attractiveness to mosquitoes, and twins that were [ not identical ] were very different in their level of attractiveness, \" says the lead researcher. \" so it suggests that the trait for being attractive or unattractive to mosquitoes is genetically controlled. \" it's an important step, adds a harvard public health expert: \" the more we learn about what causes a mosquito to find a person, the better we ' ll be able to design better strategies to protect people. \" ( check out how many chemicals involved in the scent of our hands can attract mosquitoes. )",

The still image shows the people of springfield, with marge holding an \" unido \" sign in one hand and a corner of the puerto rican flag in the other, assisted by homer and bart. Lisa sheds a tear, and a tweeted image of the scene is captioned \" how you can help. \" more on the situation: cnn's latest report is teeming with numbers: as of sunday morning, some 12 days after hurricane maria hit puerto rico, 95 % of the island remains without power. Students missed two weeks of school due to hurricane irma, and the current target has them missing at least two more, with a target return date of oct. 16 now set. While landlines are now operational, only about 10 % of cell towers are working. Nearly 65 % of gas stations were up and running on saturday, though lines remain long. Almost 60 % of the island lacked potable water. A second cnn piece describes a sea of lines amid the devastation: dozens waited in line on sunday for two hours in order to draw the maximum the atm would allow — $ 40. It's not uncommon for people to sleep in cars overnight in order to maintain their place in line at a gas station. Lines are one big issue; roads are another. Pbs newshour spoke with lt. Gen.

Brianna benlolo, 21, and tyler johnson, 25, worked at a store called zumiez, the washington post reports. Five others were injured in the attack, which a police spokesman says \" seems to have been very contained to that store and the area just outside. \" the body of the suspect was found in the store near a shotgun and a large quantity of ammunition, cnn reports. That prompted concerns he might have had explosives. The gunman at the mall in columbia shot benlolo after coming from a back changing room, wjla reports. After shooting both workers, he reportedly killed himself. The motive is still uncertain, though a federal official suggested a possible link to a domestic dispute, cnn notes.

The police chief in sparks, nevada, said 7th-grader jose reyes left one note directed at teachers and students where he \" clearly expressed anger \" at them for his being \" embarrassed and mistreated at school \" and indicated a desire for revenge, but another to his parents where he said the incident \" was not a result of shooting games or bullying \" and \" indicated he wished he could change the past, be a better kid, and a better son, \" the reno gazette-journal reports. In both notes, the suspect indicated \" that his life would end in the process, \" the police chief said. Investigators say reyes, who had recently been prescribed an antidepressant, had images of the columbine shooters on his phone and told a therapist three days before the attack that he had been teased, but there was not enough evidence to merit bullying charges against other students, the ap reports. The boy used a handgun that belonged to his parents, but the police chief said they will not be charged because there is no evidence that they were aware he knew where they kept it. The chief's press conference included a message for students: \" be nice. Be kind. Treat your fellow students with respect. We're all a little different. It matters. \"",

        "summary": "When catrina mcghaw signed a lease on a house in ferguson, mo., she didn't think to ask whether she'd be living in a former torture chamber. But when a family member told her to watch a documentary about serial killers on a&e, there was her house — including the basement where many killings took place, the beam women were tied to, and even the dining room table — given to her by the landlord — found in crime scene photos. That landlord, the mother of alleged serial killer maury travis, claims she told mcghaw about the home's dark history, but mcghaw tells kmov she'd remember the bit about multiple murders in the basement. It turns out missouri is one of 47 states that doesn't require the disclosure of a \" psychologically impacted property \" involving murder, suicide, or violent crimes when selling a house; in 15 states, a would-be buyer or renter must be told if they specifically ask. Ever since mcghaw found out she was living in travis ' home, though, she has been haunted, and the st. Louis housing authority has helped her break the lease early, reports abc news. Travis, who boasted about 17 victims in a letter and made a map of where one of the bodies was buried, was never actually charged with murder; he killed himself in his cell a few weeks after being arrested for kidnapping. Abc news in 2003 reported that police found a nightmarish video in the home, labeled \" your wedding day, \" that showed some of the torture. ( meanwhile, it took 33 years to find this man and charge him with murder. )",

            "Two los angeles firefighters, including a man who played a role in the 1993 baseball film \" the sandlot \" have been charged with allegedly assaulting a man handing out candy to kids on halloween, officials said tuesday. Mike vitar, a firefighter who played the role of benny \" the jet \" rodriguez in the film, and fellow firefighter eric carpenter and another man, thomas molnar, are charged with assault, according to a felony complaint. The incident occurred near a halloween party on oct. 31 in northwest los angeles hosted by carpenter, 38, the los angeles county district attorney's office said. The trio allegedly became angry after the victim, 22, who was visiting the neighborhood where he grew up, was walking down the street handing out candy to children, and they chased him down the street and attacked him, police and prosecutors said. Carpenter also allegedly choked the victim after he was forced to the ground, the district attorney's office said. In addition to assault, carpenter is charged with personally inflicting great bodily injury, prosecutors said. The investigation was conducted by the los angeles police department's robbery/homicide division. Attorney arthur avazian, who represents molnar, said he was still reviewing the case but said his client and the firefighters tried to restrain a man who would not leave and was trespassing. \" they believed he posed a danger to children in the area by trying to pass out candy against the consent of the adults,"

Nielsen's \"extensive professional experience in the areas of homeland security policy and strategy, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure and emergency management. \" she is the first nominee for the homeland security post who had served in the department, according to the statement. If confirmed, ms. Nielsen would replace john f. Kelly, who was homeland security secretary until he left in july to serve as the white house chief of staff and bring discipline and direction to a west wing plagued by disorganization and infighting. Mr. Kelly had drafted ms. Nielsen to be his chief of staff at the homeland security department, and when the president plucked him for the white house, he brought her as his no. 2. Known as a no-nonsense player and policy wonk, ms. Nielsen appears unlikely to land at the center of the type of controversies that have engulfed mr. Trump's presidency. But her regimented style in a freewheeling and often dysfunctional west wing frustrated some senior officials and people close to the president"

            "Ryan gosling and eva mendes were joined by their costar bradley cooper when they screened their new film, the place beyond the pines, in nyc yesterday. Ryan wore a green velvet gucci suit while his girlfriend, eva, donned an orange prada frock. Bradley made the trip to the big apple from boston, where he is currently filming a still-untitled david o. Russell film alongside amy adams and his silver linings playbook costar jennifer lawrence. He was spotted earlier this month wearing pink curlers on set, but at the premiere he showed no signs of a wavier'do, instead opting to slick his long hair back off his face. Katie holmes was also in attendance after returning to the big apple from a spring break trip to disney world with suri. Fans of ryan gosling may want to catch this film, which opens in theaters today, as the actor recently announced that he might be taking a break from acting. Don't forget to check out our review of the place beyond the pines to see if ryan's latest project is for you."

            "For the past week, mr. Trump has demanded changes in the united states ' immigration laws and encouraged congress to act with urgency. But on friday morning, he appeared to give up hope that the republican-controlled congress could succeed in passing an immigration bill this year, urging lawmakers in a tweet to stop \"wasting their time. \" the president said a vote on immigration legislation should be postponed until after the midterm elections in november, when he expects republicans to pick up more seats and create a stronger majority — a prediction that is far from guaranteed. But house republicans are moving forward as planned with efforts to pass immigration legislation, said representative steve scalise of louisiana, the majority whip. \"i think the president's expressing his frustration that democrats don't want to solve the problem while we do, \" mr. Scalise said. \"we're going to keep working to try to get it done. \" he acknowledged that passing the bill would be an \"uphill fight. \" on thursday, the house voted against a hard-line immigration measure, and republican leaders delayed a vote on a more moderate proposal, punting a decision on the bill to next week to give themselves more time to pick up support. The proposal, the product of weeks of negotiations between house republican moderates and conservatives, would provide a citizenship path for the young",

        "summary": "Highlighting just how unusual this election has become, the new hampshire primary was not only won by two anti-establishment outsiders, it was won by two outsiders who crushed the opposition by huge, possibly record-breaking margins. With donald trump almost 20 points ahead with around 90 % of results in, his victory is the biggest win in the state's gop primary since john mccain defeated george w. Bush in 2000, and possibly the biggest since ronald reagan defeated bush's father in 1980, the washington post reports. Bernie sanders ' lead of more than 20 points over hillary clinton, meanwhile, is the \" biggest margin of victory in a contested democratic primary in history, \" a sanders staffer tells politico. More: bernie sanders has become the first jewish candidate — and the first non-christian — ever to win a primary, reports the week, which notes that the iowa caucuses delivered the first-ever female winner with hillary clinton, and the first latino with ted cruz. This was a massive victory for trump, who \" proved tonight he can win, \" writes chris cillizza at the washington post, while sanders also showed he's capable of winning — if he can win over minority voters. Politico highlights some key numbers that explain how sanders and trump won. Two big ones: trump scored 65 % among voters who rated \" tells it like it is \" as a candidate's most important quality, while sanders had an amazing 91 % among voters who rated honesty as most important. Sanders also won decisively among men, women, independents, and voters under 45, the ap reports, while clinton came out on top among voters over 65. Another winner, according to cillizza, is michael bloomberg, who will be more likely to launch a third-party bid if either trump or sanders becomes their party's nominee. The new york times notes that trump's win has left new hampshire gop leaders \" perplexed and appalled, \" not least because he defied tradition by spending relatively little time in the state, with only ben carson holding fewer events.",

            "The chinese tech tycoon who bought gay dating app grindr is paying his wife an eye-watering $ 1.1 billion in a massive divorce settlement. Zhou yahui, the chairman of online gaming firm beijing kunlun tech, has agreed to transfer hundreds of millions of shares in the firm to his wife, li qiong, according to a stock exchange filing this week. The huge settlement has made headlines in chinese state media, which have described it as one of the costliest splits in the country's history. Earlier this year, the couple were ranked 11th in a global list of self-made billionaires under 40. Compiled by the hurun report, their combined wealth was estimated at $ 3.5 billion. Related: chinese tech firm buys gay dating app grindr but under a civil mediation agreement issued by a beijing court, zhou will hand over 278 million kunlun shares to li. The company's stock in shenzhen closed wednesday at 26.44 yuan, putting the value of the settlement at 7.35 billion yuan ( $ 1.1 billion ). Zhou will remain the largest shareholder of kunlun, which bought a majority stake in grindr earlier this year. Kunlun declined to comment further on the settlement. It's unlikely to be the last megabucks split in china."

        "summary": "\" marital privilege \" sounds more pleasant than what it actually refers to: exemptions written into state laws that treat marital rape differently than the rape of someone other than the perpetrator's spouse. And while rainn notes that marital rape has technically been illegal in all 50 states and dc since 1993, these marital privilege clauses still remain on the books in certain states, leading to different standards that critics say minimize victims in this category, as laid out in a daily beast report. The website points to a 2014 aequitas report that indicates eight states ( alaska, arizona, idaho, maryland, minnesota, mississippi, south carolina, and washington ) still contain marital exemptions for certain offenses — and that doesn't even take into account states that don't have such explicit exemptions but still treat marital rape differently in the way it's prosecuted. South carolina's exemption, for example, requires only evidence of \" force or coercion, \" \" aggravated coercion, \" or \" aggravated force \" to prove \" criminal sexual misconduct \" against someone who's not the perpetrator's spouse ( or separated spouse ). But if the victim is indeed the perpetrator's spouse, a higher bar must be reached for there to be a crime: simple coercion doesn't fly; instead, there must be proof of \" the threat of use of a weapon \" or \" physical violence of a high and aggravated nature \" to prosecute \" spousal sexual battery, \" the daily beast notes. The continued presence of these inconsistent standards keeps marital rape legitimized on some level, the site notes, and feeds attitudes like those expressed in a recent post on a christian blog, which notes that, according to the bible, \" a wife does not have the right over her own body, but her husband does. \" ( australia's highest court put an elderly man on trial for allegedly raping his then-wife more than 50 years ago. )",

        "summary": "In discussing michael cohen on thursday, president trump complained about people who wind up striking deals with prosecutors. Now it appears that another of his allies has done just that: vanity fair reports that david pecker, who is the ceo of the parent company of the national enquirer, was granted immunity in exchange for his cooperation in the cohen investigation. Pecker, a longtime friend of both cohen and trump, met with federal prosecutors to provide details about the payments to stormy daniels and karen mcdougal in exchange for their silence about alleged affairs with trump, reports the wall street journal. Prosecutors say pecker's company, american media, played a role in both payments. The company's role in the mcdougal story has been previously reported. At cohen's urging, american media purchased the rights to her story for $ 150,000, then did not publish it, a practice known in the tabloid business as \" catch and kill. \" the question is whether pecker and his company might have violated any campaign finance laws along the way, but his immunity deal will shield him ( and another american media exec ) from prosecution. The vanity fair post by gabriel sherman says the enquirer \" operated as a de-facto arm \" of the trump campaign leading up to the election, but it adds that trump and pecker, once close, have not spoken in about eight months.",

On tuesday, michael cohen completed his operatic turn against his former boss when he stood in federal court and pleaded guilty to eight felonies that included making hush-money payments at trump's direction to women trump allegedly had sex with. The admission effectively made trump an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal crime. Cohen's stunning admission came just days after the new york times reported that white house counsel don mcgahn provided 30 hours of testimony to mueller's investigators. Mcgahn's extensive cooperation with mueller rattled the west wing to the core at a time when aides were struggling to contain the fallout from former apprentice star omarosa manigault newman's scathing white house memoir. And now trump's most powerful media ally next to fox news has broken with him. According to two sources briefed on the cohen investigation, prosecutors granted immunity to david pecker, chairman of the national enquirer publisher, american media inc., and a.m.i.'s chief content officer, dylan howard, so they would describe trump's involvement in cohen's payments to porn star stormy daniels and playboy playmate karen mcdougal during the 2016 campaign.

That's the month when their unvested shares would have fully vested, write kirsten grind and deepa seetharaman in the lengthy piece based on interviews with people close to the situation. Facebook acquired whatsapp for $ 22 billion in 2014, a price nearly 10 times greater than that of its second biggest acquisition, and there has been a culture clash ever since. Founders jan koum and brian acton remained fiercely focused on privacy and eschewing ads as mark zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg \" grew impatient \" for a return on that meaty investment — though facebook had initially promised to keep its hands off the messaging app. Per grind and seetharaman's sources, when acton exited in september he left $ 900 million in unvested shares on the table; koum, who on april 30 said he was going, too, is expected to give up $ 400 million worth of shares. Acton originally tried to fight that, say sources, by pointing to an atypical clause in his and koum's contract that said that if facebook pushed \" additional monetization initiatives, \" the two could bow out with \" good reason \" and see all their shares vest — so long as they were employed by facebook when the monetization effort went into effect. Acton, who is said to be worth $ 3 billion, reportedly backed down after facebook indicated it would fight him on it. Read the full article, which also gets into quibbles over office chairs, here.

The infant in spain had scurvy, caused by insufficient vitamin c, and it resulted from the baby consuming only an almond milk-based formula since he was about 3 months old, live science reports. The case, documented in the journal pediatrics, reported that he suffered bone loss, thigh bone fractures, and very low levels of vitamin c. \" this case demonstrates that scurvy is a new and severe complication of improper use of almond drinks in the first year of life, \" the researchers write. \" plant-based beverages are not a complete food and they may not replace breastfeeding or infant formula, \" they add. A skin reaction when the baby was around 2.5 months old led a doctor to recommend the switch from a cow-milk formula to another diet. The infant's new staple: the almond formula, which live science describes as \" almond milk, almond flour, sesame powder, and a creamy cereal mixture. \" the new formula didn't offer vitamin c, which infants need in doses of about 50mg a day — and which is found in breast milk, most baby formulas, and fruits and veggies. Once the baby was 6 months, the mom tried to rotate pureed fruits and veggies into his diet, but he wasn't interested, live science notes. Once he was diagnosed, he was pumped full of vitamins c and d — and his symptoms improved and he began to walk. \" before you change [ a ] child's diet, it needs to be changed to a nutritionally adequate diet, \" a pediatrician at the albert einstein college of medicine tells abc news. \" this is too critical a period.

Researchers twice evaluated 240 preschoolers and kindergartners at four sites across the western us, analyzing their levels of three types of aggression at both points: physical ( hitting, kicking ), relational ( hurting others ' feelings through behaviors like ignoring ), and verbal ( name-calling ). Parents reported on their kids ' favorite superheroes and just how big of a fan their kids were — how often they watched movies or shows featuring superheroes, for example, and how strongly the kids identified with their favorite hero. The children also answered questions. In the end, researchers found that kids who were more engaged with superheroes were more likely to be physically and relationally aggressive at their second evaluation.

They also speculate that exposure to superheroes may be more problematic for children than exposure to other types of aggression in media because parents tend to \" endorse and support \" a child's love of superheroes, in the hopes that their kids might learn to help others, psych central reports.

The house was also \" unkempt, \" as the milwaukee journal sentinel puts it, and there were almost two dozen dead chinchillas in it as well. The fire department determined the home was uninhabitable after assessing the ammonia levels, and the 331 living chinchillas were taken in by the humane animal welfare society of waukesha county. The adult residents of the home confessed to breeding the small rodents for sale; they planned to get a hotel while the home was aired out. A child living in the home is staying elsewhere, wisn reports. An investigation is underway and city health and building inspectors will probably get involved, but it's not clear if a criminal investigation will factor into the situation. As for the humane society, the influx of rodents — plus two cats that were also removed from the home — has required it to call in extra help. ( even worse: this january 2014 story about a house full of dead and dying snakes. )",

United passions, an account of the international governing body over the decades, was released in just 10 us theaters, the hollywood reporter notes, and took in a grand total of $ 607 over friday and saturday — a dismal amount by any measure, but especially considering fifa threw about $ 29 million into it, the los angeles times reports. Obviously fifa had hoped to get more roi on the film, starring gerard depardieu, sam neill, and tim roth as former president sepp blatter, but it was not to be: one theater in phoenix where the movie debuted brought in just $ 9, which translates into a single ticket sale, the hollywood reporter notes. A sample review from the new york times: \" united passions is one of the most unwatchable films in recent memory, a dishonest bit of corporate-suite sanitizing that's no good even for laughs. \" ( nope, this movie's disastrous debut is not from an onion article like other supposed fifa allegations. )",

One of the officers returned fire, but it isn't clear if a suspect was hit. A video shows the officers, who had followed a suspicious vehicle into the parking lot prior to the shooting, being rushed to a hospital by police in the back of a pickup truck. White, a 26-year veteran of the force, was treated and released while woods, an 11-year veteran, remains in stable condition, per local 10. \" i can tell you from looking at the crime scene that these officers are lucky to be alive, \" says miami-dade police director juan perez. \" it's been a while since i've seen a car hit with so many bullets. \" witnesses say officers remained at the apartment complex overnight, but no suspects were arrested.",

        "summary": "Wednesday was another eventful day at the university of missouri, where the newest controversy involves a professor who told his students to ignore threats of violence and come in for an exam. \" if you give in to bullies, they win, \" wrote associate professor of nutrition and exercise physiology dale brigham in an email to students, per nbc. \" the only way bullies are defeated is by standing up to them. If we cancel the exam, they win; if we go through with it, they lose. \" this approach angered some students, especially since brigham is white and one of the threats, for which a 19-year-old man was arrested on wednesday, warns: \" i ' m going to stand my ground tomorrow and shoot every black person i see. \" brigham resigned his position as the controversy grew, but university chiefs decided not to accept his resignation. \" i am just trying to do what i think is best for our students and the university as an institution, \" the professor told komu 8. \" if my leaders think that my leaving would help, i am all for it. I made a mistake, and i do not want to cause further harm. \" in other developments: black students accused the university of downplaying the threats, and one of brigham's students tells the washington post he is an \" amazing person \" and she is surprised he didn't seem to take the threats of violence seriously enough. \" i know we are in the south, and i know that we are the minority and racial tensions are really high, \" she says. A university employee seen ordering a journalist to get away from student activists has been suspended, reports the columbia daily tribune. Janna basler, director of greek life, is on leave pending an investigation, university officials say. Another employee, communications professor melissa click, who called for \" muscle \" to remove journalists, has apologized and quit a courtesy appointment. Tim tai, the journalist basler confronted, tells the st. Louis post-dispatch that he's not sure if the suspension should happen. \" i ' m disappointed that there was shoving going on and that professors and students responded in the way that was recorded in the video, \" he says, but \" as a journalist, i didn't think twice about that encounter or trying to get some kind of punishment out of that. \" on fox wednesday night, ben carson told megyn kelly that colleges should talk to students but not accept \" infantile behavior, \" mediaite reports. He blamed campus unrest on \" outside forces who wish to create disturbances \"",

        "summary": "At least two ex-members of president trump's campaign team have been burned so far by the mueller russia investigation. Now, more rumblings about an ex-administration member. The wall street journal friday detailed an alleged plot that robert mueller is probing — one that involves flynn and his son, michael g. Flynn, receiving up to $ 15 million if they could arrange for the \" forcible removal \" of muslim cleric fethullah gulen from the us and deliver him to turkey, where president recep tayyip erdogan has long been trying to extradite him. People who say they're familiar with the probe say the fbi has already cornered at least four people about a december meeting at nyc's 21 club, where flynn and reps of the turkish government were said to be in attendance. One source said flynn was even ready to use his influence in the white house to try to send gulen back to turkey legally, via extradition. The journal's sources didn't have further details on the meeting or the alleged plot, and there's no evidence suggesting money ever came into play. But flynn was already known to have been a lobbyist for turkish interests before he joined trump's administration, though he didn't disclose that until after he'd been driven out for not coming clean about conversing with a russian operative. And ex-cia director james woolsey was at a previous meeting in september with flynn, turkish government officials, and erdogan's son-in-law and told the journal he found the subject of removing gulen from the us \" startling and the actions being discussed possibly illegal. \" what investigators are now reportedly looking into on flynn: whether he violated the foreign agents registration act, which \" requires persons acting as agents of foreign principals in the us \" to disclose such dealings.

        "summary": "It probably seemed like a wise idea to the irs at the time, but it's becoming clear that the strategy of planting a question in the apparent hope of spinning its recent scandal has, as the headline in usa today puts it, backfired. If you missed it, outgoing chief steven miller confirmed in his testimony yesterday the unusual way in which the irs first acknowledged that it targeted conservative groups: before irs official lois lerner appeared at a may 10 conference, she called washington tax attorney celia roady and gave her a question to ask during the q&a format. Roady did so, and lerner, in her response, admitted that the irs had inappropriately targeted tea party groups and apologized. The ap quickly picked up on it, and a scandal was born. The irs apparently thought it would help if the story became public in this fashion rather than in the inspector general's report due out in days. Congress is ticked because lerner had testified two days prior and didn't mention it. Even if she wasn't aware at the time, lawmakers say she or someone at the irs should have followed up with them. Miller got grilled about it: rep. Devin nunes: \" was ms. Roady's question to ms. Lerner about targeting conservative groups planned in advance? miller: \" i believe that we talked about that, yes. \" miller later said the original plan was to tell congress and the public simultaneously, but he had to admit under questioning that \" it did not happen. \" read the related transcript at the wall street journal. And business insider has roady's statement about her role, in which she says she didn't know what lerner was going to say. What a mess, writes william jacobson at legal insurrection. \" it was rotten of the irs to have roady ask the question. But, roady knew that she was asking a planted question and when the bombshell answer dropped, she could have told people that it was a set-up question. \"",

Russell george, treasury inspector general for tax administration, as they testify during a hearing at the house ways and means committee on the internal revenue service. One of the more interesting moments at the house ways and means hearing friday was when several congressmen tried to unravel how the news of the irs targeting of conservative groups came to be announced – and why lawmakers didn't find out first. The news had been announced last friday by lois lerner, head of the irs tax-exempt organizations division, in the answer to a question in an appearance at a tax conference sponsored by the american bar association. Here's a look at the exchange during the hearing, from the transcript by federal news service ( www.fednews.com ). First, rep. Devin nunes ( r., calif. ) zeroed in on this curious disclosure in questioning the hearing's irs witness, outgoing acting irs commissioner steven miller. Rep. Nunes: did you know that ms. Lerner was going to appear last friday, may 10th, on a panel called \"news from the irs and treasury \" at the american bar association conference? mr. Miller: i knew she was appearing; i did not know the topic. Rep. Nunes: did you or any of your subordinates",

            "Associated press rep. Devin nunes ( r., calif. ) questions ousted irs chief steve miller and j. Russell george, treasury inspector general for tax administration, as they testify during a hearing at the house ways and means committee on the internal revenue service. One of the more interesting moments at the house ways and means hearing friday was when several congressmen tried to unravel how the news of the irs targeting of conservative groups came to be announced – and why lawmakers didn't find out first. The news had been announced last friday by lois lerner, head of the irs tax-exempt organizations division, in the answer to a question in an appearance at a tax conference sponsored by the american bar association. Here's a look at the exchange during the hearing, from the transcript by federal news service ( www.fednews.com ). First, rep. Devin nunes ( r., calif. ) zeroed in on this curious disclosure in questioning the hearing's irs witness, outgoing acting irs commissioner steven miller. Rep. Nunes: did you know that ms. Lerner was going to appear last friday, may 10th, on a panel called \"news from the irs and treasury \" at the american bar association conference? mr. Miller: i knew she was appearing; i did not know the topic. Rep. Nunes: did you or any of your subordinates",

Texas equusearch, the volunteer organization that assists in searches for missing persons, revealed sonar pictures from portions of three of the city's bayous showing those cars, the houston chronicle reports. Now group founder tim miller is speaking out in favor of recovering those vehicles and claiming the houston police department tried to silence the group. He says that two years ago, \" i went to the detective and said, we got a problem. We've found all these cars. He said, ' you need to shut up, the city doesn't have the money and the public will go crazy about this, ' \" miller tells the chronicle. Equusearch points out on its website that the sunken vehicles pose an environmental threat, a threat to sportsmen, and may contain dead bodies, perhaps of accident or murder victims. Houston police deny any coverup, with click2houston.com quoting a rep as saying, \" we knew about most of them and did follow up and investigated two of these vehicles. Keep in mind, most of them would break apart if you tried to get them out. \" equusearch, for its part, says it could get the cars out in one piece; barring that, it would like to at least have its divers record all the cars ' license plate numbers. The cars came to light after the hpd asked equusearch to use its sonar to search a bayou for an elderly woman who went missing in october 2011; her car and body were found in a pond the next year.

        "summary": "Handedness ( the preference for using one hand over the other for nearly all tasks ) likely emerged in humans soon after we began to walk upright. And for years scientists have thought this trait belongs almost exclusively to bipedal primates, given it's never before been observed in quadruped creatures. Now they've found that red and eastern gray kangaroos appear to exhibit even truer handedness than humans — and they prefer the left to the right, researchers from russia report this week in the journal current biology. As the study observes, \" this result challenges the notion that in mammals the emergence of strong'true ' handedness is a unique feature of primate evolution. \" the lead researcher speculates that handedness also emerged in these marsupials when they began to walk on two instead of four legs. Not all marsupials exhibit a preference for one hand over the other, reports discovery. For example, red-necked wallabies tend to use their left hands for some tasks and their right for others. The team also observed that tree kangaroos, which use all four limbs to climb, also display no preference for one hand over the other, reports national geographic. Red and gray kangaroos, however, were the exception, preferring their left hands for tasks such as grooming and eating regardless of whether they were standing on two or four legs. The findings especially surprised the scientists because kangaroo brains are not connected across hemispheres the way other mammalian brains are, so studying their brains more closely could provide some clues about neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism.
