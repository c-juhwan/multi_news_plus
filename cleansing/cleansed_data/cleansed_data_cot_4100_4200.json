        "summary": "There aren't many people who reminisce fondly about their days with adolf hitler, and the world just lost one of the last of them. Rochus misch, hitler's bodyguard and the last surviving witness to his final days in the bunker, died yesterday at age 96, surrounded by his family, his literary agent announced today. His death comes just a month ahead of the english-language publication of his book the last witness, the ap reports. The ap and reuters have both spoken with misch in the past. Here are some highlights from those interviews: misch called hitler \" the boss, \" and was fiercely loyal to him, staying in the bunker long after hitler let others leave. He was the only one allowed to have a weapon inside the bunker. Misch cited his time with hitler in the bavarian alps as the happiest of his life, showing off pictures of the fuehrer surrounded by children. \" it was wonderful, like a holiday. The boss was very relaxed when he was there. \" in addition to his duties as bodyguard, misch acted as a sort of assistant, secretary, and courier for hitler. \" no matter who wanted to see hitler, no matter if it was goebbels, goering, or anyone else, they had to get past me. \" \" life in the bunker was pretty normal. Hitler was mostly very calm, \" misch once said. \" it was much less dramatic than shown by many historians. \" but there was one disconcerting element: the silence. \" everybody was whispering, and nobody knew why. That's why it felt like the bunker of death. \" misch never really condemned hitler. \" he was no brute. He was no monster. He was no superman, \" he said. He also said the dictator never mentioned the final solution around him. \" that was never a topic. Never. \" misch said he signed up for the leibstandarte ss adolf hitler unit because the movement \" was anti-communist, against stalin â€” to protect europe. \" i signed up in the war against bolshevism, not for adolf hitler. \" \" he was a wonderful boss, \" misch said of hitler. He said he and fellow ss member johannes hentschel \" were the closest people who worked with him... We were always there. Hitler was never without us day and night. \"",

        "summary": "Israeli archaeologists have hit on a stunning site in the judean hills: a 1,500 year-old byzantine basilica, which sits on top of an even older structure, which sits on top of a series of tunnels, which lead to a small cave that they believe might be the legendary burial place of the old testament prophet zechariah. What do they intend to do with this marvel of antiquities? they're going to rebury it, the ap reports. It's taken two months to unearth the site, which was discovered after tomb raiders made off with the church lintel, the afp reports. But archaeologists don't have the funds to maintain the church as a tourist destination, so they've decided to cover it back over with soil for its own protection. Curious observers have just one week left to check out the site, which boasts stunningly well-preserved mosaics dating back to the roman era.",

Color genomics says it could \" democratize access to genetic testing \" for breast cancer risk genes brca1 and brca2 with a saliva test costing just $ 249, which was made available tuesday, reports the new york times. Other tests, typically reserved for cancer patients or those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, can cost up to $ 4,000, techcrunch reports. The test will also screen for 17 other cancer-risk genes, says ceo elad gil, a google and twitter alum with a phd in genetics. He notes many women can afford the test without insurance. A geneticist and unpaid adviser for the company says the test could benefit many, as half of women with mutations don't qualify for genetic testing. Genetic counseling is also available for buyers, who will receive a kit by mail. Test results, reviewed by a doctor, will be available four to eight weeks after a saliva sample is returned, bloomberg reports. Color genomics â€” which has raised about $ 15 million from investors, including steve jobs ' widow â€” is also planning to make the test available for free to women in low-income areas. But critics say the test could do more harm than good. Another company, myriad genetics, found it could not determine if a gene increased a person's risk of cancer 2 % of the time. The rate for other genes could be as high as 30 % percent, a geneticist says, meaning tests may leave women confused about their cancer risk. Experts also say many women who aren't at risk may get tested, which would boost \" the overall cost of testing per cancer case prevented, \" the times reports.

One insider tells motherboard that the lawsuit might sound far-fetched to anyone unfamiliar with the work, but provides an example: \"someone could be being graphically beaten in a video, and you could have to watch it a dozen times, sometimes with others present, while you decide whether the victim's actions would count as self-defense or not, or whether the aggressor is the same person who posted the video. \" then it's on to the next video.",

        "summary": "The man who shot three people dead at fort hood military base before killing himself has been identified as army spec. Ivan lopez, a military truck driver who was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder. The texas base's commander says the 34-year-old, who served in iraq for four months in 2011, \" had behavioral health and mental health issues \" and had self-reported a traumatic brain injury after returning from iraq, the washington post reports. Specifically, cnn reports that he suffered from depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric issues. \" there is no indication that this incident is related to terrorism, although we are not ruling anything out, \" the commander says. Authorities say the shooting spree began when lopez entered a building and began firing a.45-caliber semi-automatic pistol that he wasn't authorized to have on base, the ap reports. It was a privately-owned weapon he'd recently bought locally and had not registered at the base. He then drove to another building and opened fire there. After he was confronted in a parking lot by a military policewoman who was about 20 feet away, he put his hands on his head before reaching into his jacket. He shot himself in the head when she drew her weapon, nbc news reports. It was \" clearly heroic, what she did at that moment in time, \" the commander says, adding, \" she did exactly what we expect of a united states soldier. \" authorities are investigating what sparked the rampage; officials believe it started with an argument in the base's motor pool. \" there are initial reports there may have been an argument in one of the unit areas, \" the commander says. At least 16 people were injured in the rampage, including three who are in critical condition, cnn reports. Lopez is married and has a toddler daughter; a neighbor says lopez's wife was \" hysterical \" when tv reports identified her husband as the shooter.",

Doctors have since discovered sam, who sometimes speaks with an australian or english accent, suffers from stage-three ovarian cancer. She says they told her a \" volleyball-sized tumor \" on her ovary may have caused her amnesia, per the sydney morning herald. \" i just feel like there's a thick fog over my mind, my memory, over my brain, \" she tells nbc san diego. \" i can't remember anything, \" she adds, though she says she feels a connection to australia and hawaii, mashable reports. She also dreams of a man who might be her husband. After months of uncertainty for sam, who's living in a retirement community, tips are now flooding in, due in part to a facebook group set up by nurses to help her out. One woman in carlsbad tells nbc san diego she knows the mysterious woman from a bible study at a catholic church on the same corner on which sam was found. \" she went by samantha to us, \" the woman says, noting she thought she was homeless. \" she was here from australia.

        "summary": "Something very weird has been spotted in space, and a quote from an astronomer at penn state gets to the heart of why it's so intriguing: \" aliens should always be the very last hypothesis you consider, but this looked like something you would expect an alien civilization to build, \" jason wright tells the atlantic. The \" this \" he's referring to involves an unusual star in the northern hemisphere's sky named kic 8462852, one that the kepler telescope first began looking at in 2009. Based on the weird light pattern it's emitting, the star appears to have a \" big mess of matter \" around it, writes ross anderson. The problem is that, based on the star's age and other factors, scientists can't explain why that \" mess of matter \" is there. In a new paper, they float a number of scientific explanations â€” \" occultation by circumstellar dust clumps, \" for instance, or comets â€” but none mesh well with current scientific understanding. \"we'd never seen anything like this star, \" says lead author tabetha boyajian of yale. \"we thought it might be bad data or movement on the spacecraft, but everything checked out. \" enter penn state's wright, who floats a doozy of a less scientific theory: the light pattern could be explained by some kind of massive structures built by aliens. No, wright \" isn't some wild-eyed crackpot, \" writes phil plait at slate, and, in fact, wright tells plait the idea should be approached \" skeptically. \" ( plait agrees, calling it, \" um, unlikely. \" ) indeed, it \" may sound like science fiction, \" notes a post at discovery, \" but our galaxy has existed for over 13 billion years, ( and ) it's not such a stretch of the imagination to think that an alien civilization may be out there and evolved to the point where they can build megastructures around stars. \" wright is working on a proposal with seti to investigate further by pointing a radio telescope at the star. The idea is to \" listen in for a sort of buzz that indicates not alien radio signals, but a sort of hum of alien technology, \" explains popular mechanics. Who knows, it adds, this could be the \" smoking gun that we're not alone. \" ( this billionaire is using his money to boost the search for alien life. )",

As for \" all those affected \" by the eighth-largest bankruptcy in us history, he is sorry, saying, \" their plight weighs on my mind every day â€” every hour. \" beyond the lengthy prepared remarks, he likely won't share much more. The new york post yesterday reported that he plans to take the fifth, and the ap reports that corzine himself said many people, if in his shoes, would go that route. But as a former senator, he says he recognizes that \" it is appropriate \" for him to respond to any questions he is asked today, and will try to. But don't hold your breath: he also noted that since leaving the firm he hasn't had access to certain documents he might need to \" reconstruct the events that occurred during the chaotic days and the last hours leading up to the bankruptcy filing. \" he adds, \" even when i was at mf global, my involvement in the firm's clearing, settlement, and payment mechanisms and accounting was limited. \" the ap notes that anything he says today could be used against him, should he ever face charges in the case.",

Scientists from aarhus university in denmark say the loss of a partner boosts a person's risk of an irregular heartbeat â€” itself a risk factor for stroke, heart failure, and death â€” by 41 %. The researchers, who reviewed medical data from nearly a million danes, found the risk was the same regardless of gender or whether partners lived together or separately, though those whose partners died unexpectedly were 57 % more at risk of atrial fibrillation, reports afp. The risk also doubled for people under 60. Scientists say it was highest eight to 14 days after a death and continued, slowly declining, for a year. In other words, \" just as time can heal an emotionally broken heart, it can also reduce the chances of developing a physically challenged one, \" reports the los angeles times. \" stress has long been linked to arrhythmia in the heart, and the acute stress of losing your partner in life constitutes one of the biggest impacts of psychological stress one would experience, \" says a researcher. \" we wanted to examine that association. \" medical records gathered from 1995 to 2014 showed 17,478 of 88,612 people diagnosed with atrial fibrillation for the first time had lost a partner within the previous year. \" the risk of developing an irregular heartbeat for the first time was 41 % higher among those who had been bereaved than it was among those who had not experienced such a loss, \" researchers say.

        "summary": "\" there's a saying, when it's too good to be true, it usually is, \" a brooklyn judge said yesterday, blasting the methods of retired nypd detective louis scarcella and freeing a man scarcella sent to prison for a 1991 murder. She overturned the conviction of rosean hargrave, which is one of dozens of scarcella cases that came under review since the detective known as a \" legend \" for his conviction rate was accused of framing an innocent man, the new york times reports. Hargrave, who was 17 when he was convicted of killing an off-duty correction officer, is now 40, and he was surrounded by family and friends as he walked out of state supreme court in brooklyn yesterday, the times reports. Another teen convicted in the case was freed in 2009. The judge ordered a new trial, saying scarcella, \" at the time of the investigation, engaged in false and misleading practices \" that \" manifested disregard to the rules, law and the truth [ and ] undermine our judicial system, \" the new york daily news reports. Six other scarcella murder convictions have been tossed by prosecutors over the last two years, but this is the first one overturned by a judge, reports the daily news. A times report on the hargrave case last fall found a long series of \" missteps, errors, and questionable decisions, \" including reliance on a single eyewitness, an apparent failure to test blood samples from the crime scene, vanished forensic evidence, and a decision to prosecute even when fingerprints at the scene didn't match those of either defendant.",

Four former kaupthing bank bosses have been sentenced to between three and five years for market abuses relating to a deal where a qatari sheikh bought a confidence-boosting stake in the bank with money that had been provided by the bank itself, the bbc reports.

In making the case that the nsa's phone-tracking program is an essential tool against terrorism, judge william pauley cited the example of 9/11 hijacker khalid al-mihdhar. If the current system had been in place back then, the nsa would have realized that al-mihdhar had been making calls from the us before the attack, the judge suggested. Instead, the agency assumed he was overseas. Bottom line: the nsa's surveillance program might have helped prevent 9/11, according to the argument. Pauley's footnote on the incident says, \" see generally, the 9/11 commission report. \" the problem with that, writes justin elliott, is that the 9/11 report \" doesn't actually include the account he gives in the ruling. \" what's more, a previous article by elliott on al-mihdhar concluded that us intelligence agencies knew of him long before 9/11 \" and had the ability to find him, but they failed to do so. \" click for the full piece, which includes the original al-mihdhar article.",

        "summary": "\" mix-up \" is a word best left out of sentences involving another word: pregnancy. But the two are making headlines together following yesterday's report that a woman in rome became pregnant with twins after undergoing fertility treatment â€” except the embryos she was implanted with weren't those of her and her partner. The woman wasn't alerted to the issue until she was three months along. The afp reports the switch somehow happened on dec. 4 at the sandro pertini hospital in rome. Four couples received treatment that day, and it's unclear whether any other improper pregnancies resulted. There's also no word on how the mix-up came to light, though rome's health authority said it learned there was \" genetic incompatibility \" between the parents and embryos on march 27. The country's health ministry is now investigating, and no further implantations are being done at the clinic. It's far from the first time this has happened: in 2009 an ohio woman implanted with the wrong embryos gave birth to a baby boy then handed him over to his biological parents; a 2000 in-vitro mix-up saw a san francisco woman implanted with another couple's embryos as well. The chronicle reports that the doctor immediately realized his mistake but didn't reveal it; susan buchweitz learned of this mistake 10 months after birth after a whistleblower tipped off the medical board of california. The biological father of her son sued for custody, and was granted shared custody in 2005. ( it's not the only alarming pregnancy story in the news this week. )",

        "summary": "Puerto rico is still struggling weeks after two powerful hurricanes last month â€” the territory's electric power authority said wednesday morning that power service was at 25 % â€” but, thanks to tesla, electricity has been restored at a san juan children's hospital. The company used its solar panels and batteries to create a solar array in a parking lot next to hospital del niÃ±o that generates all the energy the hospital needs, reports npr, citing local media. Tesla tweeted pictures of the array this week, calling the project the \" first of many solar+storage projects going live \" in puerto rico. For now, the head of the hospital says, the setup is a donation, but a deal could eventually make it permanent after the crisis has passed. Rebuilding puerto rico's power grid could take months and cost as much as $ 5 billion, but other companies are similarly stepping in to help; google's parent company, for example, has helped to restore internet service. Last week, the electric power authority signed a contract with a small and somewhat new company to restore the power grid, causing some concern; on wednesday, it was announced that retired air force col. Noel zamot has been appointed to oversee the grid's restoration, the ap reports. \" we are deeply concerned both about why and how a small, inexperienced firm was tasked with the massive job of rebuilding puerto rico's devastated electrical grid, \" nancy pelosi said in a statement, praising zamot's appointment and ability to provide additional scrutiny of the process.",

        "summary": "Way before humans, sharks, or dinosaurs, the sea sponge was very likely the first animal on earth. That's according to a pnas study out of mit concluding that a molecule in 640 million-year-old rocks came from the simple creature. Assuming the researchers are right, that means the multi-celled organisms were around at least 100 million years before most animal groups blossomed during what's known as the cambrian explosion, reports mit news. The few fossils from the pre-cambrian era are difficult for paleontologists to evaluate, so researchers looked to molecule traces left behind in rocks by decaying creatures. One molecule in particular, a modified version of cholesterol called 24-isopropylcholestane, kept cropping up, the same one produced by some sea sponges and algae today. Using what discovery calls \" evolutionary-tree detective work, \" the researchers were able to rule out algae as the source. \"we brought together paleontological and genetic evidence to make a pretty strong case that this really is a molecular fossil of sponges, \" says one of the scientists. \"this is some of the oldest evidence for animal life. \" the find isn't so much a bombshell as further confirmation of a widely held theory that life originated with sea sponges. And it opens the door to yet more questions about this earliest stage of animal life, including precisely what the organisms looked like and what kind of environment allowed them to thrive. Another biggie as stated by the mit researcher: \" why is there this big gap in the fossil record? \" ( sea sponges may have helped create other animals. )",

Distributor: lionsgate subtitles: none sometimes, movies aren't about plot and character. Art films can be more about how they look and feel than whether they tell a coherent or engaging story. Musicals can be all about song and dance. And action films can be gauged by how well they mix the adrenaline and testosterone cocktail that movie-goers are expected to imbibe. Such is the case with from paris with love, a production that views exposition as a necessary evil and dispenses it as quickly as possible so it can get back to shooting people and blowing things up. The movie is intellectually flat but viscerally involving and keeps the pace at such a consistently high level that it can become exhausting. With its wink-and-a-nod approach, it recalls some of the campier action epics of the 1980s, when icons like stallone, schwarzenegger, and willis strode across the cinematic landscape sowing death and destruction.

        "summary": "The us has just about cinched a deal with afghanistan regarding the us military presence in the country after next year's big withdrawal â€” and it hinges on president obama writing a letter acknowledging us \" mistakes \" in the war, reports the wall street journal. ( the new york times has the story, too, and it says that hamid karzai demands what the newspaper terms a \" contrite \" letter from his american counterpart. ) the letter likely won't be characterized as an official apology by either side, but it will \" mention that there were mistakes made in the conduct of military operations in the past, in the conduct of military operations by united states forces in the last decade, and that afghans have suffered, and that we understand the pain and therefore we give assurances and make sure those mistakes are not repeated, \" says a karzai spokesman. In exchange, karzai would allow us troops who remain in the country to conduct raids on afghan houses in the hunt for terror suspects. Whatever deal is reached will need eventual approval by an approximately 2,500-member council of village elders, and the stories suggest that the obama letter would go a long way toward winning that approval. The war might soon be over in the eyes of the public, but the deal \" has the potential to commit thousands of american troops to afghanistan \" for years to come at a cost of billions to us taxpayers, writes richard engel at nbc news.",

He has left sheremetyevo airport and will remain in an \" undisclosed location \" for at least a day, according his lawyer anatoly kucherena. Russian news agencies showed pictures of someone who might have been mr. Snowden climbing into a car at sheremetyevo airport thursday afternoon, though no western reporters witnessed any part of his passage through passport control and departure from the airport â€“ where he has spend almost 7 weeks apparently cooped up in a \" capsule hotel \" in the legal limbo of the vast transit zone. On snowden's immediate agenda is a phone call from his father, which mr. Kucherena said would be set up today, and some rather heavy contemplation about his future. Kucherena told journalists that the passport-like temporary asylum document he's been issued will enable him to travel freely"

        "summary": "The concern that cellphones may lead to cancer has been bounced around for years â€” and partial results from a $ 25 million government study purport to have found such a link, though with major caveats, the wall street journal reports. Per the so-far results of the multiyear national toxicology program study ( which the journal says has been peer reviewed, but the washington post says has not ), \" low incidences \" of two types of tumors â€” brain \" gliomas \" and heart \" schwannomas \" â€” developed in rats exposed to high doses of radiofrequency radiation, or rfr, like that emitted from mobile phones. \" even a very small increase in the incidence of disease resulting from exposure to [ rfr ] could have broad implications for public health, \" the report released thursday said. But, adds associate ntp chief john bucher, \"the results from our studies are far from definitive at this point, \" per usa today. For humans, \"this may have relevance. This may have no relevance. \" to conduct the study, scientists directed rfr signals into the cages of pregnant rats, then into the cages of the babies for a total of nine hours every day for two years. In the end, 2 % to 3 % of dosed males contracted gliomas, and 6 % to 7 % contracted schwannomas. But \" there was no significant cancer uptick in the female rats dosed with radiation, \" per the post â€” and the radiation rodents actually lived longer than the control rats. That, in addition to other factors, has left some experts skeptical, noting that the study has only been partially completed and that rats are prone to what nbc news calls their \" own unpredictable vulnerabilities to cancer, \" meaning humans may not face the same risks. All of this has led the post to suggest a better headline for this report may be \" research that hasn't been vetted yet shows possible link between cellphones and cancer in male rats. \" still, a former head of the ntp tells scientific american, \" it actually has me concerned, and i ' m an expert. \" the full report is set to be released next year.",

        "summary": "The pedestrian, the human backup operator, and the vehicle were all taken by surprise in what is believed to be the first pedestrian death in an accident involving a self-driving car, video released by police in arizona shows. The video shared by police in tempe on tuesday shows 49-year-old elaine herzberg walking her bike from a darkened area across a street outside a crosswalk, and cuts off right before impact, the arizona republic reports. The video also includes footage from inside the self-driving volvo, where the backup operator can be seen looking down until the final moments before looking up, apparently shocked. The vehicle was going 40mph, and there's no sign that it slowed down. The video \" is disturbing and heartbreaking to watch, and our thoughts continue to be with elaine's loved ones, \" says uber spokesman andrew hasbun. \" our cars remain grounded, and we're assisting local, state, and federal authorities in any way we can. \" uber suspended road testing of its self-driving car program in several cities after the accident, though tempe police chief sylvia moir tells the san francisco chronicle that looking at how herzberg \" came from the shadows right into the roadway, \" it appears that the collision would have been hard to avoid in any mode, human-driven or autonomous. Local media identified the driver as 44-year-old rafaela vasquez, though police say the driver was named rafael.

The caller said an adult male and a young female had been staying in the cabin for about a week. Police set up a perimeter around the cabin after the call and arrested cummins after he emerged around 9: 30am thursday, the tennessean reports. Siskiyou sheriff jon lopey says two loaded handguns were found inside. Cummins is being held without bond on a federal charge of knowingly transporting a minor with the intent to engage in sexual activity and will be arraigned on friday. Police say thomas, who came out of the cabin as cummins was being arrested, has been transferred to fbi custody and is being treated as a crime victim, the siskiyou daily news reports. Tbi chief mark gwyn says cummins was caught because they \" mobilized a nation \" to be on the lookout, and \" you can't hide from millions of people. \"",

Owing what the us government claims is some $ 560,000 in child support, joseph stroup fled arrest in 1998, at some point arriving in alberta, canada. Known there as joop cousteau, he got to know staff at a now-closed bar called the bears den, outside of calgary, which is where the cherry pit enters the story, reports the cbc. One day in november, stroup, 64, ordered an odd drink â€” a cherry coke topped with eight maraschino cherries â€” then complained a cherry pit, which he held in his hand, had caused damage to his teeth, says bar co-owner scott winograd. Maraschino cherries, winograd knew, have their pits removed. When stroup later brought in handwritten forms he claimed were from a dental office, winograd did \" maybe an hour's worth of googling \" and arrived at the justice department's website, which listed stroup as america's most wanted deadbeat parent, per the calgary herald. The picture was \" a spitting image. It was absolutely him, \" winograd tells the cbc. He alerted us authorities and \" within an hour i had the fbi, us marshals and the office of the inspector general calling, \" he says. \" they really wanted this guy. \" arrested by the canada border services agency on feb. 1, stroup was arraigned in federal court in chicago on feb. 16, reports mlive.

Cubitat is a 10-by-10-by-10-foot cube, and it's got practically everything you need built in, treehugger reports. One side has a whole kitchen, with a sink, dishwasher, fridge, and more, all in a single wall. Another side features a pullout bed from which you can watch a tv mounted in a nook. Need a bathroom? the cube's got a built-in toilet. It even features a laundry machine and storage space. You ' ll have to hook it up to plumbing and electricity, but the makers â€” a toronto firm called urban capital and a designer named luca nichetto â€” say the idea of cubitat is a \" plug and play \" space, slate reports. They call it, per ctv, \" the most adaptable home imagined. \" \" cubitat is about a more intelligent, holistic way to design and construct our living environments, taking cues from the prefab world and modern production methods, \" says an urban capital developer. \" as a builder we look at the automotive, consumer product, and tech industries and ask why we can't operate with that much rapidity and flexibility. \" among the minor kinks to be worked out: how do you fit a 10-foot cube through your door? well, maybe you won't have to: \" the idea is to hoist and slide cubitat onto a condo floor mid-construction, \" says a project description, per slate. And when you're feeling less urban, you can \" ship cubitat from the city to the country so you retire in your own home. \" ( perhaps the designers could give some tips to the eu parliament, whose building is so confusing it's nearly left some in tears. )",

When all participants were quizzed about the scenario 24 hours later, then again four months later, those who had been drinking said \" i don't know \" more often â€” but when they did answer, their descriptions were just as accurate as those of the tonic-tippling group.

Prosecutors alleged munoz had put up a marker designed to confuse pilgrims and reroute them toward his small farm in asturias near the trail, which the ap reports leads to a cathedral believed to house the remains of st. James the apostle. The new york times reports that while munoz was also found guilty of robbing thiem of $ 1,100, he provided no information as to motive. Munoz's defense tried to make the case he was suffering from severe psychiatric issues at the time, reports reuters. He had been arrested five months after thiem vanished on april 5, and her body was found partly buried on his property. Reuters cites a summary of the jury's decision that finds munoz \" ambushed \" thiem, giving her no opportunity to defend herself. Per the coroner's report, cause of death was serious brain injuries caused by repeated beatings. A judge will issue a sentence in the coming days; prosecutors want 27 years for the murder.

The festive lights use around 6.6 billion kilowatt-hours a year, according to the cgd â€” more than the total annual electricity consumption of countries like el salvador, cambodia, or ethiopia, which has a population of around 97 million. The researchers, who used data from the world bank and a 2008 us energy department study, say christmas lights only account for 0.2 % of america's electricity usage, but the power is still enough to run 14 million refrigerators. Todd moss, the coo of cgd, stresses he isn't a grinch who wants to get rid of festive lights. \" i think christmas lights are a good thing, \" he tells npr. \" a beautiful thing! i ' m not trying to be anti-christmas at all. \" he says the point of the research is to highlight the huge differences in energy consumption worldwide â€” and the hypocrisy of wealthy countries telling nations like ethiopia that they should only develop renewable energy sources. In colombia, meanwhile, a severe drought has hit hydropower generation hard, causing widespread electricity rationing and forcing many cities to scale back christmas lights, the ap reports.

Pitaro, who was hired march 5 following the abrupt departure of john skipper, told reporters at a media event on espn's campus in bristol, conn., that the network has not previously shown the national anthem during its monday night football broadcasts and does not have plans to change â€” at least, not in the immediate future.

            "The reason we look forward to the met ball above all other star-studded events ( yes, including the oscars ) is simple: it's the only night that celebrities feel brave enough to turn their sartorial efforts up to eleven, either because of the high-fashion guest list, the gala's often evocatively nutty themes, or both. But this year's exhibit â€” american woman: fashioning a national identity â€” while surely worthwhile, didn't seem likely to inspire the same crazy get-ups as, say, the year they decided to focus on superheroes. Would something so vague quash the urge to don a brave, outlandish, or downright insane outfit, we wondered? we're thrilled to tell you it didn't, and in fact, if these are contenders for our national identities, then you better get cracking on outfitting your clothes with their own electrical plugs. Yes, you read that right. Please click through to see who lit up the room â€” literally â€” and find out if your favorite made our list of the ten most wonderfully weird ensembles.

This time, the ad in question showed a black woman pulling off her brown shirt to reveal a white woman in a pale shirt, who then pulled off her shirt to reveal a non-caucasian, but still light-skinned, woman wearing a slightly darker shirt. The images went viral after makeup artist naomi blake posted them to facebook on friday, jezebel reports. Many called the image of a black woman appearing to turn into a white woman racist, pointing out that soap companies used to advertise their products with images of black people using soap to clean themselves and reveal white skin. On saturday, dove responded with an apologetic statement posted to social media: \" dove is committed to representing the beauty of diversity. In an image we posted this week, we missed the mark in thoughtfully representing women of color and we deeply regret the offense that it has caused. The feedback that has been shared is important to us and we ' ll use it to guide us in the future. \" in a further statement to the guardian, the company described its original post, which has since been deleted, as a \" three-second video clip. \" as npr notes, this isn't the first time a dove ad has been called racist; in 2011, a body wash ad appeared to depict a darker-skinned woman as \" before \" and a lighter-skinned woman as \" after, \" though the company later said all the women in the ad were meant to \" demonstrate the ' after ' product benefit. \"",

        "summary": "When professional cyclist and tattoo artist kayle leogrande was busted for doping, he never imagined it would lead to the downfall of one of the most celebrated bikers of all time. But that's pretty much what happened, explains the new york times. The heavily tatted biker was an aspiring cyclist as a teen, but took a break â€” until he was inspired by armstrong in the 2004 tour de france. He signed on with a pro team and soon discovered that doping was ubiquitous in the sport. He joined in. Leogrande got suspended ( thanks to his own confession, not a failed test ), in 2008. When he left behind drugs in the freezer of an old apartment, his landlord called the feds, who questioned leogrande about the sport in general and armstrong in particular. Asked if he thought armstrong doped, he recalls responding, \" if you were a rider at that level, what would you do? \" it wasn't long before the fda started interviewing armstrong's teammates.

' \" but whether armstrong remembered this tattooed guy or not, their fates would soon become intertwined. Four years ago, the united states anti-doping agency suspended leogrande for using a blood-boosting hormone known as epo. His case grew into the lengthy investigation that culminated in armstrong's lifetime ban from the sport. \"when i see what's going on with lance now, i have to laugh to myself a little bit, \" leogrande said as he sat in his shop this week, still dumbfounded that he played a pivotal role in the fall of one of the most accomplished cyclists in history.

Beyond that they're split, though the majority aren't enthusiastic: the movie, about a teen who loses his brother in a car accident, \"tries to capture the crushing weight of loss, but between the insipid pop tunes and the repetitive shots cutting away to a lighthouse on a scenic outcropping, it feels more like a film version of a condolence card, \" writes claudia puig in usa today. \"zac efron can act, \" declares rex reed in the new york observer, but the script \"is so sappy you want to laugh. \" efron \"deserves better movies than charlie st. Cloud. \" it's \"a delicate film, \" mick lasalle writes for the san francisco chronicle, \" that holds together on the strength of efron's physical presence and performance. \" the film is inconsistent, writes james berardinelli for reelviews.

At issue is its \" five spice \" donkey meat, which was sold to customers in china. Officials in eastern shandong province last month said that the product actually contained fox meat, and walmart today announced it would recall the product after dna testing identified the presence of other animals. Those who bought it will be paid out the equivalent of $ 8.25. Walmart, for its part, says it will take some action: it's digging into the donkey meat manufacturer, and reuters reports that a senior employee of the meat supplier has been detained. Upping the ick factor: the christian science monitor reports that while donkey is a delicacy in china, fox meat... Smells \" rank, \" and comes cheap, with fur-farmers looking to unload the otherwise unusable carcasses. Grosser still, the monitor points to a quartz article that notes meat manufacturers try to get away with using fox by also using chinese products like \" fish-smell removal king, \" whose website proclaims that \" getting rid of the fishy smell of fox meat is one of the hardest tasks in the world! \" the wall street journal and reuters point out that this isn't walmart's first food flap in the country: in 2011, it was fined for selling duck meat beyond its expiration date; last year, officials claimed it was making baked goods using expired eggs. The latest development is no doubt an unwelcome one for walmart, which intends to open 110 more stores on top of its current 359 in what is the world's no. 1 grocery market.

        "summary": "People who eat fast food may have higher levels of potentially infertility-causing industrial chemicals in their body, according to a new study. Bloomberg reports researchers were looking specifically at dehp and dinp, two types of phthalates found in everything from cosmetics to window blinds. They studied nutrition data from nearly 9,000 people and found those who got more than 35 % of their total energy intake from fast food in the previous 24 hours had dehp and dinp levels 24 % and 39 % higher respectively. Phthalates may be entering fast food products through packaging, gloves worn by workers, or machinery used to process the food. Meat and grain products from fast-food restaurants were shown to be the most associated with higher phthalate levels in diners, according to a press release. \" our findings raise concerns because phthalates have been linked to a number of serious health problems in children and adults, \" researcher ami zota says in the press release. Previous studies show those problems include possible damage to the male reproductive system. While the american chemistry council says phthalates aren't harmful, the epa is concerned about them, japan has banned them in food-prep gloves, the eu has limited their use in food, and a 2008 us law restricted them in children's toys. Further studies are needed to see if phthalates in fast food are responsible for any health problems. But zota has some solid advice either way: \" people concerned about this issue can't go wrong by eating more fruits and vegetables and less fast food. \" ( phthalates in mom's nail polish could lower baby's iq. )",

The chemicals, which don't occur in nature, are common in cosmetics, soap, food packaging, flooring, window blinds, and other consumer products. The centers for disease control says \" phthalate exposure is widespread in the u.s.

The poem, \" what must be said, \" criticizes what grass considers western hypocrisy over israel's nuclear program, and says the state represents a threat to \" fragile world peace, \" reports the guardian. Though israeli officials ' fury is sparked by the poem, authorities are officially banning grass based on a law allowing them to bar any ex-nazi. Grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999, and is perhaps best know for his critical fictional work on the rise of nazism in germany, the tin drum. He admitted in an autobiography in 2006, however, that he himself was drafted into a waffen ss nazi paramilitary unit when he was 17. Israeli holocaust historian tom segev called grass ' allegations \" absurd, \" but also criticized israel's chilling lack of tolerance for criticism, notes ap. \" the need to delegitimize criticism is a very dangerous, autocratic tendency which has increased in recent years, \" said segev. Grass said he only intended to criticize the government of benjamin netanyahu. \" i have often supported israel, \" he said. \" i want the country to exist and at last find peace with its neighbors. \" check out a translated copy of the poem here.",

        "summary": "The size of many people's bellies may be determined by some of the billions of bacteria living in their guts, according to new research. Scientists took pairs of human twins â€” one twin obese, the other thin â€” and transplanted some of their gut bacteria into young mice that had been raised microbe-free, the bbc reports. When they were fed the same diet, the mice with the obese twin's bacteria grew fat while those with the lean twin's bacteria did not. And when the mice were exposed to each other's bacteria in a \" battle of the microbes, \" the obese mice grew lean but the thin mice did not gain weight. Much more research remains to be done, but experts say the \" weird and wonderful \" finding that gut bacteria can cause obesity could lead to new therapies in the not-too-distant future, reports the new york times. Since people, unlike mice, don't tend to eat each other's droppings, a fecal transplant would be the simplest way of transferring thin people's bacteria to obese people. Such transplants are already used to treat a persistent gut infection, cbs notes, but the lead researcher says there is a less nauseating alternative: tailoring combinations of bacteria to suit patients, then growing them in a lab and turning them into pills. And getting the right combination of bacteria could be very important â€” another group of researchers working with microbes in mice guts found that transplants could result in major personality changes.",
