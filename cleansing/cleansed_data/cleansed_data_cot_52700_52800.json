        "summary": "Heavy shelling was reported today in aleppo and damascus, as government forces and rebels both gear up for a major showdown, reports reuters. The syrian military is sending convoys of tanks, troop carriers, and other hardware to the vital central cities, leaving rebels in control of much of the countryside. Activists claimed that rebels controlled about half of aleppo, and, outgunned by the military, they doubt rebels can hold the city, reported the new york times. Other developments: rebels are rushing to stockpile munitions in aleppo, reports the bbc, and setting up checkpoints and snipers even as thousands of residents flee the city. One resident in a palestinian refugee camp in southern damascus reported heavy shelling in the south of the city, beginning around 7am and continuing for three hours. As government forces pull out of the kurdish parts of syria to prepare for the large offensive against the rebels in aleppo and damascus, kurds are using the withdrawal to fly the kurdish flag, asserting their independence, reports the guardian.",

The mlk estate has successfully sued usa today, cbs news, and the emmy-winning documentary series eyes on the prize, keeping it out of circulation for years. The kings also raked in $ 700,000 over the mlk memorial in washington, dc, and have licensed king's speeches for ads by apple, mercedes, chevrolet, and alcatel. \" we never even asked \" for the rights, selma director ava duvernay tells the washington post. She knew dreamworksskg owns them for a future steven spielberg film, and that \" with those rights came a certain collaboration \" — ie, estate influence over king's portrayal. Why is it legal? because king was a private citizen, not a government official, so his speeches and writings were his and passed onto his estate. What's more, congress has extended copyright protection to the author's life plus 70 years ( matching international standards ), so mlk's work will become public domain on jan. 1, 2039. The family has mostly kept quiet about all this, usa today reports, but one of king's sons, dexter, has written that \" people don't want us, as the heirs, the estate, to benefit... Or for my family to be in any way comfortable. \" yet the estate does have limits: it initially demanded $ 20,000 from clarence jones, king's personal attorney and speechwriter, for including the \" i have a dream \" speech in a book — but jones published anyway, and the estate backed off, the national review reports.",

In florida, once the margin dips below that benchmark, a recount is automatically triggered. State officials will reportedly order the recount on saturday. Scott, currently the governor of florida, reacted via his spokesman, per politico: \" this race is over. It's a sad way for bill nelson to end his career. He is desperately trying to hold onto something that no longer exists. \"",

The bbc explains that two-headed animals like lucky — a condition called craniofacial duplication, or diprosopus — can be produced in a variety of ways: they can come from a single fertilized egg that never fully separates, be the result of a developmental anomaly in which the head keeps growing until it breaks into two new ones, or emerge when cells that set off head development somehow get moved to the wrong part of an animal's body. Lucky's two middle eyes don't work, she can only walk in circles, and she tends to fall down a lot. She also needs assistance when chowing down — and both her mouths move when she's chewing — but she seems healthy otherwise. \" it's something i've never seen before, and i think it's amazing, \" stan tells wdrb.

            "It was a blood-chilling sight. The multi-headed lernaean hydra, a fearsome, serpent-like creature, emerged from its lair and bore down on a waiting heracles, the son of the greek god zeus. But heracles had a plan. Earlier, he had realised that the hydra would regrow any head that was chopped off, so he had enlisted the help of his nephew iolaus. I ' m absolutely convinced that they noticed these naturally occurring abnormalities around them this time, when heracles struck at the creature, iolaus swooped in and burnt the stump of its necks with a firebrand, preventing the diabolical beast's heads from growing back. All the while the hydra hissed and writhed, its poisonous blood and breath threatening to exterminate greece's greatest hero. But he prevailed. The monster's final head was at last amputated and a victorious heracles was able to progress to the third of his twelve labours. A multi-headed beast with poisonous innards and the ability to regrow body parts – it was certainly some feat of imagination. In one telling, the hydra has as many as 50 heads, though several depictions show it with far fewer. But where did this extraordinary idea come from? could the greeks have got their idea for a multi-headed serpentine ogre from nature itself? scientists have documented rare cases of two-headed specimens for many years. One, l e cable, wrote during the 1940s about a two-headed pipefish embryo. He called it a \" tiny monstrosity \". More recently, developmental biologist arkhat abzhanov at imperial college, london, has seen many examples of two-headed creatures in his lab. With the help of a modern understanding of genetics, he has observed mutations and cellular displacements that could allow for this phenomenon. Such cases could well have inspired ancient writers of myths. Two egotisms in the place of one \" i ' m absolutely convinced that they noticed these naturally occurring abnormalities around them, and tried to explain them in some way or incorporate them into their culture, \" says abzhanov. It's true that, from time to time, two and even three-headed animals are found in the wild or in captivity. Interestingly, this phenomenon – known as polycephaly – does not seem restricted to any one class of animals. Take fish, for starters. In 2013, a two-headed bull shark foetus was discovered in the gulf of mexico. The",

According to financial records reviewed by the new york times and nbc news, a company linked to a russian oligarch targeted by us sanctions deposited around $ 500,000 into an account controlled by essential consultants, the shell company cohen used to pay hush money to daniels before the 2016 election. Michael avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch viktor vekselberg may have \" replenished the account \" in a series of payments in 2017 after the daniels settlement, though columbus nova, a us affiliate of a vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to trump's personal lawyer, the washington post reports. The purpose of the company's payments is unclear. Sources tell cnn that robert mueller's investigators have already quizzed vekselberg about the payments to cohen's company. Records reviewed by the times show that around $ 4.4 million flowed through the essential consultants account between its creation weeks before the 2016 election and january this year, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical firm novartis, at&t, and korea aerospace. At&t confirmed the payments late tuesday, saying cohen's firm was among those it \" engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration, \" the ap reports. Cohen isn't a registered lobbyist, and while the unusual payments may not have broken any laws, trump and his attorney \" have a lot of explaining to do, \" avenatti said in a tweet tuesday.",

The video is earning praise, with one prominent emirati commentator calling it \" a beautiful ad on counter violence and extremism \" on twitter. Yet others were rankled by the fact that terrorism victims were featured ( some say it's exploitative ) and that an actor played the part of omran daqneesh, the child in a now-famous photo out of syria after his home was hit in an airstrike. \" part of justice for any victim is to expose his killer, \" one writer notes, pointing out the real omran wasn't attacked by extremists but by the syrian regime.

        "summary": "The washington post takes a look at the country's surging heroin epidemic by zeroing in on pennsylvania's washington county, a place one local detective refers to as \" ground zero \" for heroin in the area. Last sunday, in less than 70 minutes, eight heroin overdoses were recorded in the county of about 200,000 people. By a day later, that number had jumped to 16; by two days later, 25 — three of which were fatal. As the post notes, this period of time wasn't an isolated case but rather \" an extreme example of what communities in parts of the country are enduring. \" in a florida community earlier this month, 11 people overdosed on heroin in a 24-hour span, wkmg reported; this year, cedar rapids, iowa, had seen 44 heroin overdoses by june 5, the gazette reported; new jersey saw 781 overdose deaths related to heroin last year, 101.5 reported. Just yesterday, npr ran a story on marion, ohio, a small town whose police chief says that his team sometimes responds to as many as three overdoses in just one hour. One of the reasons heroin is booming: it's cheap — cheaper than the prescription drugs that, for some, start them down the road of addiction. And one of the reasons there are so many overdoses? nowadays, the drug is even more potent. The us attorney for western pennsylvania is one of a growing number of prosecutors who aren't interested in jailing users, the post reports: \" if they're using and trafficking, i prosecute them. If they're just using, they need help, \" he says. But finding dealers — including any linked to fatal overdoses, who will be charged with homicide — is no easy task, as these days drugs are sold via cellphone or even, with more middle-class people addicted now, in unlikely locations like homes. The county's supervising detective sums up the \" out of control \" heroin problem: \" i'd be glad to have the crack epidemic back. \" click for the full post article.",

What's truly behind the trend of childhood obesity are the sodas, frozen pizzas, and cookies consumed at home, school, and whenever kids aren't in a mcdonald's or burger king booth — a \" western diet \" high in saturated fats and added sugars, according to a new study. Researchers looked at the eating habits of 4,466 american kids, aged 2 to 18, and grouped them based on what they ate when they weren't eating fast food. What they found: those with the highest rates of being overweight or obese ate a western diet — even if they ate no fast food; on the flip side, those who were high fast-food consumers but otherwise ate a \" prudent \" diet were much less likely to be overweight or obese, the los angeles times reports. The more often a child ate at fast food spots, however, the more likely he or she was to follow a similar diet at home. But \" just because children who eat more fast food are the most likely to become obese does not prove that calories from fast foods bear the brunt of the blame, \" one author says, per red orbit. In fact, health campaigns targeting fast-food restaurants may be \" overestimated \" in that they are \" not sufficient to reduce child obesity if the remainder of the diet is not addressed. \"",

        "summary": "The tax overhaul in the works has drawn controversy over possible changes to 401( k ) plans and deductions for homeowners, but another, lower-profile topic has emerged as a sore point. The house plan unveiled last week would eliminate a one-time tax break for families that adopt children. The break can be a substantial one — it's $ 13,570 in 2017, which can take the sting out of adoption costs that can approach $ 40,000 if done through an agency, per the hill. The issue has become a flash point on the right because conservatives equate the credit with supporting pro-life, pro-family values. \" being pro-life means being pro-adoption, \" tweeted gop sen. Ben sasse. \" congress must remember this as we work through the details of tax reform. \" now the washington post highlights a different wrinkle: the house's top tax writer has two adopted sons. Rep. Kevin brady, chair of the house ways and means panel, has called his adoptive kids the \" biggest blessing, \" but he defends the credit's elimination. It's \" not working, \" he tells the post, saying that some families can't claim it because they don't pay enough in taxes or don't itemize. A piece at vox notes that the credit is indeed \" nonrefundable, \" meaning that parents who don't make enough to owe federal taxes aren't eligible. Those in the middle or upper-middle class, making between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000, claim the credit the most. Brady argues that tax overhaul will help all families in a more general sense by, say, increasing the child tax credit. Still, expect the issue to remain contentious. Congress \" may end up funding planned parenthood while abolishing the adoption tax credit, \" writes david french in the conservative national review. \" that's intolerable. \"",

            "Suspended \" nbc nightly news \" anchor brian williams \" has the chance to earn back everyone's trust, \" his boss at nbc news said thursday, as the network confirmed that williams will return to television later this summer, but in a reduced role. Nbc also confirmed that lester holt, williams ' fill-in since february, will become the permanent anchor of the \" nightly news. \" the appointment makes holt the first african-american solo anchor of a weekday network nightly newscast. In a press release, nbc news chairman andy lack credited holt with performing \" remarkably well over the last few months under very tough circumstances. \" related: lester holt gets anchor chair in historic moment as for williams, lack said the anchorman's \" excellent work \" in the past had earned him a second chance. Williams quickly embarked on what was dubbed an \" apology tour, \" meeting with nbc staffers in both new york and washington d.c., where he was \" deeply apologetic. \" after williams'suspension ends in august, he will have two main jobs: he ' ll be an \" anchor of breaking news and special reports \" on nbc's ratings-starved msnbc cable news channel, and he ' ll \" serve as a breaking news anchor for nbc news live special reports when holt is not available. \" here"

        "summary": "Love actually fans went nuts when it was announced that a 12-minute sequel would air during the uk's red nose day as part of its comic relief special last friday. The spot doesn't officially air in the us until may, but this being 2017 and all, video snippets and recaps abound. And, well, bad news for those aforementioned fans — many people say the love actually bit was not so great. Spoilers ahead: on cracked, amanda mannen writes that the sequel \" destroys \" the original movie. You find out that mark apparently hasn't seen his one-time best friend peter at all in the 13 years since he declared his love for peter's new bride in the film, then-little-boy sam never did move on from joanna and may in fact have creepily followed her to the united states, and jamie and aurelia still don't speak one another's languages. Bottom line? \" love actually is more complicated than a slightly overlong christmas movie, and that's kind of terrifying. \" at the mirror, adam postans describes the sequel bit as \" a poor man's four weddings and a funeral that ­delivered precisely nothing. \" at the guardian, barbara ellen suggests the sequel should have been named guff actually. \" it was all lousy jokes and texted-in performances and looked as though it had been cobbled together by fourth formers as an end-of-term project, \" she writes. Another guardian reviewer, peter bradshaw, calls the spot \" bafflingly weak. \" he does note that, as to the inevitable question of who aged the best, it's clearly martine mccutcheon, who played the prime minister's wife — \" she genuinely doesn't look any different from 2003. \" the sequel has taught us that \" if you get together in christmas 2003, you will stay together forever. It's just science, \" writes anna leszkiewicz at the new statesman. \" even if you've spent nearly 14 years clinging onto public office. Even if you were a literal child when you met. Even if you hate your wife so much you refuse to learn her first language. \" but not everyone was disappointed. Radio times calls the sketch \" funny \" and \" poignant, \" the telegraph calls it \" winningly nostalgic and a triumphant return, \" and vanity fair and rte round up tweets from satisfied viewers ( who especially loved hugh grant dancing again ).",

But some are cautioning that looks can be deceiving. In interviews with pro-government outlets — including reporter kinana allouche, who once shared a selfie with the bodies of rebel fighters — omran daqneesh is seen next to his father as the older man accuses rebels of using omran as a propaganda tool. \" they wanted to trade in his blood and published his photos, \" he says, per the bbc. Mohamad daqneesh, who lost an older son in the airstrike, adds he refused rebel offers to leave aleppo because the rebels only seek to hurt the reputation of the syrian army, per mashable. Allouche notes \" those who tried to shed syrian blood mislead the news that he was hit by the syrian arab army. Here he now lives in the syrian state with its army, its leader and its people. \" the interview marks a decided turn for the regime of bashar al-assad, who last year said the photo of omran in an ambulance was \" forged. \" but a rep for the syria institute suspects a propaganda campaign has only just begun and says the family was \" probably \" coerced. Since rebels withdrew from aleppo in december, \" they are under government control now and this is a government that we know arrests and tortures anyone that speaks out against it, \" the rep tells reuters. The assad regime is known to offer incentives to those who speak out against rebels, reports the guardian.",

Those familiar with the inside baseball of libertarianism know that paul is referring to two thinkers, ludwig von mises and murray rothbard, whose idea of capitalism \" is even more libertarian and anarchic than that espoused by many libertarians, \" writes yglesias. \" austrian economics \" rejects all government regulation and intervention to help the poor, and considers the tweaking of short-term interest rates a mistake that lures investors into doomed enterprises. Yglesias mounts a counter-argument, noting that the \" austrian \" view doesn't explain the effectiveness of post-great depression fixes or the spending habits that fuel recessions. Yglesias sees an economic recovery around the corner, but if there isn't one, \" these faddish views may gain more steam and perhaps we really all will be austrians someday soon.

Nicole dugraye even started a facebook group for all the women called \" nicole from last night, \" thereby turning zetina's email into a way to make new friends. Ironically, the intended recipient nicole reportedly didn't receive the email and only learned of it through social media. Lucky for zetina, she wasn't pulling a fast one with a fake phone number and believes he just got a digit wrong. She not only wants to meet up with zetina, but intends to hang out with all her fellow nicoles, too.",

        "summary": "The fbi hopes new surveillance footage released today will aid in the recovery of 13 priceless artworks stolen 25 years ago and help put to rest one of boston's greatest mysteries. In the early hours of march 18, 1990, two men dressed as cops were let into the gardner museum, where they tied up two security guards and absconded with the artwork and the museum's security footage, the boston globe reports. But the thieves, who have never been identified, may have missed one key thing. According to the fbi, surveillance footage from the day before the robbery shows a security guard letting a man into the museum — against protocol — through the same door later used in the robbery. The globe reports it's unclear why this footage wasn't viewed by law enforcement earlier, but it could show a \" dry run \" of the heist. The newspaper identifies richard abath as the security guard in the footage, and the fbi is hoping the public can help identify the mystery man he lets in. Abath, a rock musician at the time who now lives in vermont, has claimed he had no part in the robbery, but this new footage appears to contradict a number of his statements. No one has ever been charged with stealing the art — for which there is a $ 5 million reward — and no one ever will, as the statute of limitations has expired. Someone in possession of the paintings, however, could face charges. Their total value exceeds $ 500 million, reports ap.",

Ibm's sequoia system knocked japan's k computer into second place after clocking in at a staggering 16.32 \" petaflops \" — that's 16 quadrillion calculations per second, reports the wall street journal. The supercomputer — which takes up 96 racks, each bigger than a fridge, at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california — can compute in one hour what it would take everybody in the world 320 years working non-stop using hand calculators to compute, the bbc notes. This is the first time an american computer has taken top spot since 2009, and sequoia also won praise for energy efficiency: it consumes 7.9 megawatts compared to the k computer's 12.6 megawatts. The department of energy will use sequoia to run simulations designed to help extend the life of aging nuclear weapons, eliminating the need in these cases to run underground nuclear tests. Quips engadget's sean buckley, \" more computers, less explosions.

Authorities say retired army officer richard ojeda, a democrat running in tuesday's primary, was brutally beaten by a man wearing brass knuckles at a political cookout on sunday, the ap reports. Per the washington post, jonathan porter, 41, was arrested and charged with malicious assault for the attack, which left ojeda — who's known porter since they were kids — with multiple head and face fractures and a concussion. And while officials aren't sure what the motive was, ojeda thinks he knows. \" this was premeditated and there was a reason the guy did this, \" he wrote sunday on his campaign's facebook page. Ojeda, who has been campaigning against the region's corruption and poverty, adds, per nbc news, that \" the moment you start asking questions, you become public enemy number one. \" per the state journal, ojeda says porter approached him at the cookout, asked for a bumper sticker, then attacked. \" as i ' m kneeling down putting the bumper sticker on [ porter's truck ], that's the last thing i remember, other than … coming to where my head's on a tree stump and i ' m spitting blood, \" ojeda says. Witnesses say after the beating, porter hopped in his truck and tried to run ojeda over before bystanders stopped him; porter then fled, surrendering a few hours later. Ojeda, 45, tells the state journal he'd received menacing phone calls recently, including one that said, \" you're going to wind up dead floating in the guyandotte river. \" but the man described in a facebook post as \" tough as woodpecker lips \" says he's dealt with al-qaeda and the taliban and writes he's \" now even more dedicated to the cause.

Until now in the us, those who've used this legal tactic have been human. But a new york judge yesterday ruled that the writ may be used by two lab chimpanzees at stony brook university, science magazine reports. Ny supreme court justice barbara jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the nonhuman rights project by appearing in court may 6 to argue why the college is holding hercules and leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the save the chimps sanctuary in fort pierce, fla., per the nhrp's website. \" this is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals, \" natalie prosin, the project's executive director, tells science. The case kicked off in december 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the nhrp down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A pepperdine university law professor tells science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \" it would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons \" without doing so, he notes. Prosin, meanwhile, says her group isn't stopping with the chimps and will also target the release of other animals. ( click to read about what chimps talk to each other about. )",

            "Habeas corpus, or the great writ, is the legal procedure that keeps the government from holding you indefinitely without showing cause. When you challenge your detention by filing a habeas corpus petition, the executive branch must explain to a neutral judge its justification for holding you. Habeas corpus prevents the king from simply locking up subjects in secret dungeons and throwing away the key. It's been a pillar of western law since the signing of the magna carta in england in 1215. The founders of our nation believed habeas corpus was so essential to preserving liberty, justice, and democracy that they enshrined it in the very first article of the united states constitution. What happened to habeas corpus? in its waning days, the last congress passed the military commissions act ( mca ) of 2006.

But the tunnel remains controversial, with stonehenge fans weighing in on both sides. One supporter says tourists will \" once again be able to hear the sounds of skylarks \" instead of traffic. And unesco, which lists stonehenge as a world heritage site, is in favor of the tunnel. But the council for british archaeology is against it, the guardian reports. The council's president says the area around stonehenge is the \" world's most significant and best-preserved stone-age landscape. \" that's why the stonehenge alliance also opposes the current tunnel plan. The group wants the tunnel length increased to at least 2.7 miles to reduce disruption to the immediate area. Officials are accepting public comment on the tunnel through the beginning of march.",

Barack obama followed him, demanding a private explanation for the shutdown. \" john, what happened? \" he asked. \" i got overrun, that's what happened, \" boehner replied. That anecdote kicks off politico's behind-the-scenes look at the crisis. The wall street journal has one too — with different bits of insider gossip. Here are the most interesting tidbits from both: obama and harry reid decided on their no-negotiation strategy over the summer, believing that boehner could never unite his fractured caucus behind anything. Republicans never believed the pair would stick to it. Boehner and reid initially struck a deal in which boehner would pass a sequester-level budget with an obamacare-defunding rider that the senate could simply strip out. Boehner assumed — incorrectly — that his caucus only wanted a show vote. Boehner's former chief of staff was feeding the white house intelligence, telling it that boehner would have to fight up until the debt ceiling deadline. Reid also took to monitoring twitter for hints on the gop's next move — a sign of how badly communication was flowing. Many republicans turned to joe biden, hoping he would intervene. Biden told them he'd been \" sidelined … at the direction of the president, \" one rep says. Reid, bitter about the fiscal cliff deal biden negotiated, had wanted him out. At one point, boehner brought up the idea of a \" grand bargain \" at a white house meeting; reid laughed in his face. When paul ryan joined the fray at an oct. 10 meeting, he told obama that he would \" miss his moment \" and derail his whole term if he didn't strike a deal. But he also made what white house aides called a \" freudian slip, \" saying, \" we're going to have six weeks to negotiate the debt limit. \" that night, aides to boehner, cantor, and obama began talking about a broader budget deal, and agreed to talk more in the morning. The white house never called. When mitch mcconnell finally decided he had to broker the deal, he partnered with lamar alexander — angering susan collins, who had worked far harder on the process, only to see her own deal torpedoed. Mcconnell picked alexander because he had better conservative credentials, and was pals with reid confidante chuck schumer. Alexander and schumer brokered the deal behind the scenes, then passed it off to reid and mcconnell. Mcconnell tells the washington post that he saw himself as a backup quarterback",

The three-month project, which wiped out two tons of arms using what the times calls a \" giant, high-tech oven, \" ended last week. \" it's a big breakthrough, \" says an expert, noting that the process — a basis for the much larger effort in syria — \" was very difficult because of weather, geography, and because it's a dangerous area with warring tribes, increasing the risks of theft and diversion. \" in 2004, gadhafi had provided some 24.7 metric tons of chemical weapons to the west for destruction, but only half were gone by the time civil war began in 2011. The post-gadhafi libyan government sought to rid itself of the remainder, as well as almost two tons of additional material it had found — agents already installed in bombs and artillery, the times notes. The destruction effort, which used funds from the pentagon as well as canada, saw the weapons vaporized in an oven created by swedish firm dynasafe. Meanwhile, the bbc is airing old gadhafi secrets in a special tonight; among them, a former ally who says the strongman ordered a plane shot down near tripoli in 1992, killing 157 passengers in a demonstration against sanctions.",

For libya's fragile transitional government, such collaboration with the west on security matters is a delicate issue.

( see video here. ) kelly is hosting the 9am slot of the today show on nbc, and monday's show included the cast of the rebooted will &amp; grace and a feature on a nun fighting gun violence in chicago. So how did show no. 1 go? a sampling of reviews: warm and fuzzy: episode no. 1 \" felt like something of a coming-out party for the new, warmer kelly, \" writes jeremy barr at the hollywood reporter.

Better balance? at usa today, kelly lawler writes that the episode was a \" bit awkward \" as kelly, who displayed \" some stiffness \" at times, transitioned into her new role. \" there's a difference between choosing to focus on lifestyle and entertainment over political news, and ignoring the fact that politics exist in everyday issues, \" she writes. \" megyn kelly today would do well to strike a better balance. \" questionable strategy: brian lowry at cnn also found the debut a little awkward. He cautions that it's too early to draw conclusions, but writes that it seems nbc landed kelly without a clear sense of how to make use of her talents. What's more, \" it's at best questionable to introduce a show that so consciously seeks to create space between itself and serious news at a moment when there's such an abundance of it. \" harsh take: at the washington post, hank steuver delivers a particularly negative review. \" the debut was like watching a network try to assemble its own bride of frankenstein, using parts of ellen degeneres, kelly ripa and whatever else it can find, \" he writes.

        "summary": "He who pays the piper calls the tune, and it looks like the military-industrial complex is going to be dancing to donald trump's tune for years to come. Trump shook up the defense industry once again on thursday when he tweeted about negotiations for fighter jets, pitting boeing and lockheed martin against each other, reports reuters. \" based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the lockheed martin f-35, i have asked boeing to price-out a comparable f-18 super hornet! \" tweeted trump, who has been holding meetings with aerospace execs at his mar-a-lago estate. Lockheed shares, which went down 4 % after an earlier trump tweet, dived 2 % in after-hours trading, while boeing was up 0.7 %. A roundup of coverage: politico takes a close look at the implications of trump involving himself so closely in the federal procurement process and turning it into a \" $ 440 billion weapon. \" presidents including obama have used the process to advance their agendas, but experts say it's unprecedented for one to target individual companies and contracts the way trump is doing — and his approach is likely to create great uncertainty for defense companies. Business insider looks at the f-35's capabilities — and the $ 379 billion contract for lockheed to supply 2,443 of them to the military. Pentagon officials involved with the f-35 says the fifth-generation jet is far ahead of the boeing plane, meaning it would take years of redesigning and testing for the super hornet to have the same capabilities. The ap reports that boeing spokesman todd blecher said: \" we have committed to working with the president-elect and his administration to provide the best capability, deliverability, and affordability, \" while lockheed declined to comment. Bloomberg reports that trump's action \" sidelined decades of policy and practice in how the government spends billions of dollars annually on military hardware. \" a teal group military aircraft analyst tells bloomberg that trump's tweet was \" bizarre, \" especially since only the navy uses the super hornet, while the marines are \" completely dependent \" on f-35bs and the air force is sticking with the f-35a. \" thus, trump's tweet is both late to the game and completely irrelevant. \" retired rear adm. Dave oliver tells politico that trump's attempt to bring the tactics of the new york real estate market to military procurement will probably just drive prices up. \" he will scare the bejesus out of some fifth-level auditor who is going to say, ' goodness gracious, maybe i ought to look at whoever he is attacking at the moment,'says oliver, who was a top pentagon acquisition official in the 1990s. \"",

        "summary": "The cia's inspector general is calling for the justice department to look into allegations that the agency illegally spied on aides to the senate intelligence committee as they gathered information for a potentially contentious report on the cia's torture program, mcclatchy reports. The cia had insisted that the intelligence committee staffers use computers at agency headquarters to review millions of documents related to its interrogation program. The committee believes the cia monitored those computers, despite a specific agreement not to, according to mcclatchy sources. The 6,000-page report remains classified, but the new york times notes that it is a \" withering indictment \" of cia tactics and results. Mark udall yesterday sent president obama a letter saying that, \" as you are aware, the cia has recently taken unprecedented action against the committee, \" without specifying what that action was. Committee chair dianne feinstein would confirm only that \" there is an ig investigation. \" the committee has been battling to release its unflattering report, which the agency wants to keep classified. Udall accused the agency in december of withholding an internal review from the committee — and that apparently led the cia to accuse the committee of gaining unauthorized access to agency databases, leading to this current dispute.",

But he made everyone forget about hooves with 12 minutes of the superior hoofing that first made him america's song-and-dance sweetheart. It ended better than it started. Timberlake spent the first couple of valuable minutes under the stage, in a recreation of a sleazy nightclub where you can't see the artist and everyone is holding cell phones over their heads — a vision of hell, for some of us.

            "It wasn't a super bowl halftime show to die 4. But justin timberlake's only minimally prince-augmented performance proved to be the fumble-free affair he needed this weekend. Yes, he wore a weird shirt emblazoned with lovingly photographed elk, proving that, no, he hasn't been reading the comments about his much-snickered-about \"man of the woods \" album rollout. But he made everyone forget about hooves with 12 minutes of the superior hoofing that first made him america's song-and-dance sweetheart. It ended better than it started. Timberlake spent the first couple of valuable minutes under the stage, in a recreation of a sleazy nightclub where you can't see the artist and everyone is holding cell phones over their heads — a vision of hell, for some of us. But he brought himself out of that \"filthy \" milieu and out into the stadium open, where he was joined by what seemed like hundreds of dancers on what seemed like thousands of stages. Haters will continue to say it",

Prince, who died in april 2016, wasn't just minneapolis ' own king of pop, he also gave the super bowl its best-ever halftime show performance in 2007. Yet, it's unlikely that prince and his deservedly-large ego would've been satisfied with the treatment he received: a tribute from justin timberlake, an artist with whom prince had a historically fraught relationship, during a show that fell woefully short of the purple one's legendary 2007 set.

The huffington post first revealed the romney-stericycle connection, but bain kept it from blowing up into a controversy by claiming that romney left the firm in february 1999, before the deal was made. But sec documents obtained by mother jones list romney as \" sole shareholder, chairman, ceo, and president \" of bain and as a definite participant in the deal — a deal that made him and his partners millions; one document even includes his signature. The documents are relevant not only because of the abortion controversy, but because of romney's departure from bain. He has used the official account of the timing of his exit to defend himself — not just with regard to the stericycle deal, but also with regard to the recent article about bain's connections to major job outsourcing. In that case, the romney campaign noted that his february 1999 exit came at least a month before bain acquired two of the companies that outsourced jobs. But these documents indicate romney was still playing a role at the company until the end of that year. Mother jones has a detailed look at the documents — as well as stericycle's troubled safety record.",

For the first time, the olympics featured a team made up of refugees from the world's conflict zones. \" you have inspired us with your talent and human spirit, \" ioc president thomas bach said in his closing address.

She won a record-tying fourth gold in one of the greatest olympics a gymnast ever had, displaying what penelope blackmore at the guardian calls \" jaw-dropping power, laser precision, and pure dynamism. \" almaz ayana's record-breaking run. Some 27 world records were broken in rio. The first to fall inside the olympic stadium was the women's 10,000-meter record, which the ethiopian runner beat by more than 14 seconds. Liina, lily, and leila luik. The estonian women set a different kind of olympic record by becoming the first triplets ever to compete in the marathon. Helping hands. America's abbey d ' agostino and new zealand's nikki hamblin showed true olympic spirit — and won fair play awards — by helping each other after a tumble in the women's 5,000 meters. The brits who are being called the best couple. Kate and helen richardson-walsh not only became the first same-sex married couple to compete in the olympics, they won the field hockey gold. Changing of the guard. Phelps had an olympic swimming career that might never be matched unless dolphins start competing — though he was beaten in the 100-meter butterfly by 21-year-old singaporean joseph schooling, who grew up idolizing phelps. Soccer gold. Brazilians breathe soccer, and they got what the ap calls a \" perfect finish to an imperfect olympics \" when their team beat germany to take the gold.",

When it was first displayed in paris a century ago, in modigliani's first and only solo show, police immediately shut the exhibition down, the ap reports. The artist died three years later at the age of 35. ( another modigliani nude sold for $ 170 million in 2015. )",

Scientists say they've identified a molecule that \" reverses \" the effects of down syndrome in mice. The molecule is called sonic hedgehog pathway agonist, and it was administered to mice who were genetically altered to have characteristics akin to those of down syndrome. The molecule, which is not approved as safe for humans, spurs a gene to make a protein tied to development. \" most people with down syndrome have a cerebellum that's about 60 % of the normal size, \" says one of the johns hopkins researchers. Science world report notes that the mice were injected on the day they were born, at which point their cerebellums hadn't fully developed. The single injection appeared to normalize the cerebellum's growth. In an added surprise, memory and learning, \" which are generally controlled by the hippocampus, not the cerebellum, \" were also positively affected. But the researcher explains that applying the treatment to humans is a tricky proposition, and could have unintended consequences, like raising cancer risk.",

        "summary": "Humans were thought to be unique as a species in that we use both halves of our brains to \" distinguish different aspects of sound, \" as georgetown neuroscientist stuart washington puts it. Turns out we're not as special as we thought. A type of bat also displays this hemispheric specialization when it comes to sound processing, washington has discovered. In both humans and parnell's mustached bats — a species that lives in an area ranging from mexico to brazil, redorbit reports — the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports. For humans, the right hemisphere \" may allow us to identify who is speaking, to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice, and to tease out pitch in music, \" washington notes. As for the left hemisphere, \" men largely use just the left hemisphere \" to process language, while women use both hemispheres to do so, washington says. In mustached bats — named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts, animal diversity web explains — the right hemisphere's slower processing is used for sonar, \" which relies on detecting small changes in frequency, \" says washington, senior author of the study in frontiers in neuroscience. The left is used \" to distinguish communication sounds from each other, because ( the bats ' ) communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency. \" all this is more than just a matter of interest: the findings could help study human language disorders, especially since some study techniques \" can only be permitted in animals, \" washington adds. ( researchers are also learning more about how porpoises use sound — a lot like a flashlight. )",

            "Parnell's mustached bat ( pteronotus parnellii ) is native to north, south, and central america. Its range stretches from southern sonora, mexico to brazil. It prefers a habitat within moist areas, but it will live in arid deciduous forests. Parnell's mustached bat can have a wingspan of up to 1.9 feet and bears squat, pointed ears. Although it does not have a nose leaf, its lips are pointed upwards creating a funnel shaped mouth. It prefers to roost in caves and tunnels, and it will occasionally roost with other bat species.

He's now expected to repeat conspiracy allegations, though sources tell the post and the times that clinton and dnc officials were unaware of the role of fusion gps. The ap reports the fbi has corroborated parts of the dossier, which alleges russia worked to help the trump campaign and amassed compromising information on him. Former clinton spokesman brian fallon tweeted that if he'd known about steele's role, he would \" have volunteered to go to europe and try to help him. \" he added that if the information compiled by steele helps robert mueller's investigation, anything paid to him and fusion gps would be \" money well spent. \"",

Now, scientists have decoded the endangered species ' genome, and they say they've found some clues as to how today's land animals evolved from a fish ancestor, reports the new york times. First, some fascinating backstory: the times explains that the coelacanth and lung fish — both \" lobe-finned fish \" — have been duking it out for the title of the closet relative to that first ancestral fish that used its fins to walk on land. Post-decoding, the lungfish emerges as the closer relative, but in the times'telling, the \" coelacanth may have the last laugh \" — that's because the lungfish genome is too long to decode using current technology. What scientists learned from the coelacanths'dna: even though coelacanths don't have a placenta, they have a gene related to one that allows land animals to grow a placenta. A dna sequence found in coelacanths, but not ordinary fish, bolsters the genes that helps an embryo grow limbs. Researchers actually injected the coelacanth's sequence into mice; \" it lit up right away and made an almost normal limb, \" says one. You can check out the original article at nature.",

            "As the species with a sequenced genome closest to our most recent aquatic ancestor, the coelacanth provides a unique opportunity to identify genomic changes that were associated with the successful adaptation of vertebrates to the land environment. Over the 400 myr that vertebrates have lived on land, some genes that are unnecessary for existence in their new environment have been eliminated. To understand this aspect of the water-to-land transition, we surveyed the latimeria genome annotations to identify genes that were present in the last common ancestor of all bony fish ( including the coelacanth ) but that are missing from tetrapod genomes. More than 50 such genes, including components of fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) signalling, tgf-β and bone morphogenic protein ( bmp ) signalling, and wnt signalling pathways, as well as many transcription factor genes, were inferred to be lost based on the coelacanth data ( supplementary data 7 and supplementary fig. 9 ). Previous studies of genes that were lost in this transition could only compare teleost fish to tetrapods, meaning that differences in gene content could have been due to loss in the tetrapod or in the lobe-finned fish lineages. We were able to confirm that four genes that were shown previously to be absent in tetrapods ( and1 and and2 ( ref. 29 ), fgf24 ( ref. 30 ) and asip2 ( ref. 31 ) )",

The coelacanth and the lungfish have long been battling for the honor of which is closer to the ancestral fish that first used fins to walk on land and give rise to the tetrapods, meaning all the original vertebrates and their descendants, from reptiles and birds to mammals. The decoding of the coelacanth genome, reported online wednesday in the journal nature, is a victory for the lungfish as the closer relative to the first tetrapod.

        "summary": "The new york times has a deep dive on how walmart bet big on its business by investing in its employees. In 2015 the retailer quietly implemented a new focus on employee welfare, increasing pay across the board and developing programs to make the management track more accessible to employees. Although the program hasn't helped walmart's struggling stock price, it has allowed walmart to increase sales, increase employee satisfaction, and claw back some trust and loyalty from consumers. According to its official fact sheet, walmart pledged $ 2.7 billion over two years to increasing employee pay and benefits. The nyt reports that so far, the initiative has raised the average pay for a full-time non-managerial employee to $ 13.69 an hour, a 16 % increase since 2014 and above average pay for retail employees. However, some business leaders and analysts remain skeptical. Writing for bloomberg, columnist megan mcardle notes that for a large, publicly held company like walmart, profitability looms above all. If the company's renewed focus on worker welfare doesn't start paying real, quantifiable dividends, shareholders will push for it to return to a cheaper business model, even if that means relying on fewer workers.",

Women will be allowed to undergo the procedure in cases where the mother's life is at risk, including through potential suicide. Abortions due to rape, however, remain banned. The country's parliament voted 127 to 31 to support the new law, which was pushed by prime minister enda kenny amid excommunication threats from catholic leaders. Kenny kicked 74 lawmakers out of his fine gael parliamentary group after they voted against the measure, the ap reports. But with some 4,000 irish women traveling to britain last year for abortions, critics say the move isn't nearly enough. \" women pregnant as result of rape, women with fatal fetal anomalies, couples who simply can't afford to care for a ( or in most cases, another ) child, will still be left behind, \" says an activist.

            "Irish parliamentarians passed a groundbreaking law early on thursday allowing limited abortion rights in the republic. Enda kenny and his coalition government pushed through the protection of life in pregnancy bill, which will allow for abortions only when a woman's life is under threat if her pregnancy continues or if she is suicidal. Despite threats of excommunication from cardinals and bishops, the privately devout catholic prime minister eventually won the vote after a marathon two-day debate in the dáil. Members voted by 127 to 31 to legalise abortion in cases of medical emergencies as well as the risk of suicide. However, pro-choice and anti-abortion groups have already threatened court cases to challenge the new law. The legislation which passed through the dáil after 24 hours of tortuous debate will not stop the annual abortion trail from ireland to britain. According to irish department of health figures released on thursday, about 4,000 irish women travelled to british hospitals and clinics to terminate their pregnancies last year. They included 124 who were under 18. The new law also does not include women who were raped, meaning grim traffic across the irish sea for abortions will continue.

            "Irish parliamentarians passed a groundbreaking law early on thursday allowing limited abortion rights in the republic. Enda kenny and his coalition government pushed through the protection of life in pregnancy bill, which will allow for abortions only when a woman's life is under threat if her pregnancy continues or if she is suicidal. Despite threats of excommunication from cardinals and bishops, the privately devout catholic prime minister eventually won the vote after a marathon two-day debate in the dáil. Members voted by 127 to 31 to legalise abortion in cases of medical emergencies as well as the risk of suicide. However, pro-choice and anti-abortion groups have already threatened court cases to challenge the new law. The legislation which passed through the dáil after 24 hours of tortuous debate will not stop the annual abortion trail from ireland to britain. According to irish department of health figures released on thursday, about 4,000 irish women travelled to british hospitals and clinics to terminate their pregnancies last year. They included 124 who were under 18. The new law also does not include women who were raped, meaning grim traffic across the irish sea for abortions will continue. Mara clarke, director of the london-based abortion support network, a charity that raises money to help women afford the £ 400-£ 2,000 it costs to travel and pay privately for an abortion in england, condemned the restriction on",

Scientists who came across the bone of one of the earliest modern humans in europe in a cave known as pestera cu oase noticed it had both modern human and neanderthal traits. Now, a study of the bone's dna — made possible by recent technological advances — explains why. \" the sample is more closely related to neanderthals than any other modern human we've ever looked at before, \" harvard researcher david reich explains in a press release. \" we estimate that 6 % to 9 % of its genome is from neanderthals. This is an unprecedented amount. \" in comparison, all people except sub-saharan africans share 1 % to 4 % of their dna with neanderthals today. Dna in the fossil, which is 37,000 to 42,000 years old, suggests the oase individual had a neanderthal ancestor four to six generations back, reports reuters. In other words, a great-great-grandparent might've been a neanderthal, notes livescience. That shows interbreeding occurred far more recently than scientists had guessed; they initially thought interbreeding took place only in the middle east between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago. \" it's an incredibly unexpected thing, \" reich says. \" in the last few years, we've documented interbreeding between neanderthals and modern humans, but we never thought we'd be so lucky to find someone so close to that event. \" you aren't likely to share any dna with the jawbone's owner, however. Reich says the hunter-gatherer was from a \" pioneer population \" that entered europe but \" didn't give rise to the later population. \" ( the oldest neanderthal dna is some 150,000 years old. )",

        "summary": "Florida authorities have let the imagined voice of an 8-year-old girl who went missing on memorial day weekend in 1984 take over the palm beach county sheriff's department twitter account. Through a series of tweets with the hashtag #justice4luna, they led a social media campaign that included the tweets \" help!!! \" and \" why are you taking me? why are you doing this? nothing will ever be the same after this. \" the washington post calls it \" an eerily unorthodox campaign to resurrect the girl's story — by resurrecting the girl. \" and while many seem to agree that the tweets are disturbing, the social media response has been largely positive, with people thanking the department for trying to revive interest in the 33-year-old case. The last time anyone saw her, marjorie \" christy \" luna had slipped out of her house in a turquoise swimsuit and walked to belk's general store to buy cat food while her mother napped, reports the new york daily news. The post reports that authorities suspect one victor wonyetye is responsible. He was at a party in her neighborhood the day she went missing and soon moved to new hampshire, where an 8-year-old girl went missing while walking to school. He died in 2012 after being released from prison for indecent exposure and burglary, and inmates claim he admitted to killing both girls. Canadian authorities used a similar social media campaign in the hopes of finding a girl who went missing in 1986, and say it brought information that made it \" absolutely worthwhile. \" ( this cold case has had numerous twists. )",

Pugh and her mom apparently followed them via gps on her godsister's phone, and found the pair watching a movie at a drive-in. \" he let her drive, \" says pugh, \" so she drove him to the drive-in. He didn't even have any money. She actually paid their way to get in the drive-in just so i could get my car back. \" griffin was soon arrested by memphis police and charged with property theft, per lex 18. Police say he's been arrested before, for robbing a restaurant with two other men in 2016.

After two decades of what the fda calls \" exhaustive and rigorous scientific review \" the aquadvantage salmon will be hitting supermarket seafood cases. According to abc news, the aquadvantage is an atlantic salmon with a chinook salmon growth hormone that allows it to grow all year and a gene from the eel-like ocean pout to activate that growth hormone. Basically this means the aquadvantage will be big enough to eat in a year and a half instead of the three years required for a normal atlantic salmon. The aquadvantage is a \" game changer \" — nutritious food that's environmentally responsible, says ron stotish, ceo of aquabounty, which makes the genetically altered salmon. The post reports the approval of the aquadvantage was opposed by everyone from food-safety activists to the salmon fishing industry. \" i think it is a grave mistake we will come to regret, \" says one environmental group representative. Opponents call the aquadvantage a \" frankenfish \" ( though technically it would be a \" frankenfish's monster, \" but that's neither here nor there ) and worry it could get loose and destroy the wild atlantic salmon population. Aquabounty assures opponents that all its salmon are bred female and sterile, making their survival in the wild impossible ( which sounds ominously familiar ). According to abc, laws don't require stores to label the aquadvantage, and it's likely consumers won't even know they're eating it. Whole foods, trader joe's, target, and others have already vowed not to sell the genetically altered salmon, the post reports.",
