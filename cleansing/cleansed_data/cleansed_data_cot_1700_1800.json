        "summary": "Detroit water and sewerage has been shutting off water to thousands of residents who are behind on paying their bills — and now a coalition of activists is asking the un to get involved. As of march, nearly half of the city's 323,900 dwsd accounts were delinquent, the detroit free press reported at the time. Since april, nearly 7,000 clients have lost water service, and some say they were never warned their water would be shut off, thinkprogress reports. In a report last week to the un special rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, activists say some families have abandoned their homes after more than a year without water. \" this is the worst violation of the human right to water i have ever seen outside of the worst slums, \" one of the activists says, per fox 25. Water rates have jumped 119 % over the past decade — and will be raised by 8.7 % july 1, a challenge for residents of a city with a 40 % poverty rate. The activists'report cites a city rep who confirms that the shut-offs were to get more aggressive, targeting 3,000 delinquent customers per week, as of june 2. The activists also allege that dwsd is treating business clients — roughly half of which are also delinquent — differently, though a dwsd rep insists any account, either residential or commercial, gets shut down if it is $ 150 delinquent or 60 days in arrears. The activists say dwsd is trying to get rid of lower-income customers so the department will be more attractive to private investors for a potential takeover, al jazeera america reports, another charge dwsd denies. But privatization of the department is possible, detroit has said, as the city works to lower its debt — $ 5 billion of which is tied to dwsd. ( in slightly better news, last week detroit got a $ 195 million life raft. )",

According to the christian science monitor, hawking says it's a \" near certainty \" that disaster will strike the human race within a thousand years if it stays on earth, which he calls \" fragile. \" there are some challenges on earth, such as the depletion of its natural resources, humanity won't be able to overcome, he argues. Fortunately, the rate of space exploration is speeding up again, with private companies like boeing and spacex picking up the slack from nasa and other government agencies. Nasa is continuing its search for \" goldilocks \" planets, and elon musk recently outlined his plan for colonizing mars. Hawking himself sounded optimistic, the independent reports. \"remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet, \" he said monday. \" however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.

Three more of the nepalese guides remain missing, reports ap, and another three remain hospitalized. The avalanche struck yesterday morning as the guides were slowly hauling equipment up a narrow, perilous pass called \" popcorn field \" in some accounts, or \" golden gate \" and \" khumbu icefall \" in others. A member of the nepal national mountain guide association tells the new york times that the pass is so dangerous, guides generally leave before sunrise to prep the route — before the day's heat can cause ice to shift. \" our friends started a little late, \" he says. \"they arrived at quarter to seven. \" at another point, he sums up the sherpa-climber relationship this way: the guides do nearly all the work, while the foreign climbers get the glory. Tim rippel, a mountaineer leading an expedition with his company peak freaks writes in a blog post that \" there is a lot of soul searching going on right now \" on everest. \"everyone is shaken here at base camp.

The real estate mogul and \"celebrity apprentice \" host has made more than $ 1.3 million in donations over the years to candidates nationwide, with 54 percent of the money going to democrats, according to a washington post analysis of state and federal disclosure records. Recipients include senate majority leader harry m. Reid ( nev. ), former pennsylvania governor edward g. Rendell, and rahm emanuel, a former aide to president obama who received $ 50,000 from trump during his recent run to become chicago's mayor, records show. Many of the contributions have been concentrated in new york, florida and other states where trump has substantial real estate and casino interests. The donations provide another view into the odd political spectacle surrounding trump, who may be the most unlikely of possible gop presidential hopefuls in an already eclectic field. Although candidates such as mitt romney and tim pawlenty have spent years carefully crafting and plotting a white house run, the tycoon and fixture of the new york tabloids has leapt onto the scene with loud proclamations and surprisingly strong poll numbers among likely republican voters. The iconoclastic developer and television personality is attempting to appeal",
            "Hannity: recently, you said that if you don't get the nomination that you would run as an independent. You are asking republicans -- trump: i didn't say that. I said i would certainly think about that. Because the question is what happens if you don't get the nomination? and this was also before the new polls came out that showed me leading. But they said, what happens if you don't get? would you consider running? i said yes, i would consider running as an independent. Hannity: all right. But if you do that, that would be the greatest gift to barack obama and -- trump: unless i won. No, no, unless i won. Hannity: in reality though, if you are a conservative and you didn't get the nomination you are running against another conservative, you split the vote, barack obama sails into the presidency. Trump: unless i thought i could win as an independent. I wouldn't do that, because if i lost, i get a tremendous amount of votes and i would take them all from the republican party, which would be terrible. So, unless i thought i could win, really win as an independent, i would not do that. Because i"

Former lindenwood university wrestling star michael l. Johnson was originally arrested back in october, after one of his partners told police that he'd become infected, according to the indianapolis star. Four more men soon came forward. Police believe johnson knew he had hiv, but didn't tell his partners, and didn't use a condom. But last week, police revealed that they'd found a laptop with 32 videos of johnson having unprotected sex with different people — only one of whom they'd previously identified, the st. Louis post-dispatch and kmov report. Based on the furniture, they believe the videos were shot in his dorm room. Police don't think any of the victims knew either that they were being recorded or that johnson had hiv. They're urging those people, or anyone with information on the case, to come forward. Johnson has been charged with recklessly infecting another with hiv, and recklessly exposing others to infection, and faces up to life in prison.",

That's precisely what police say happened late last month in austin, texas. According to police documents, turney and free awoke to the sound of a gunshot and breaking glass around 3: 40am on jan. 26. As they hid in a bedroom closet and called 911, an armed man described by police as \" single, lonely, and disturbed \" searched the house for them, reports the albuquerque journal. Coming up empty-handed, he left and got into his car, only to be confronted by police. After hearing a gunshot come from inside the car, an officer returned fire. Christopher giles, a 23-year-old who'd made the 11-hour journey from new mexico, was pronounced dead at the scene. Noting giles may have died from a self-inflicted gunshot, authorities say they later found notes on giles ' phone suggesting he'd \" developed a fondness \" for 30-year-old turney, who shares video blogs with 341,000 subscribers on youtube, and a dislike for her 29-year-old boyfriend, co-host of \" the slow mo guys \" channel, which has more than 10 million subscribers. \" i want gavin free to die alone, with no children, \" he said in one of the notations mentioning the couple, police say. Giles \" resented free for his lifestyle and success \" and his \" sole intent was to cause harm to someone who resides \" at the home, a detective wrote in a complaint. \" it's been a rough time for meg and myself the last few weeks but we are doing ok, \" free said in a monday tweet, per the austin american-statesman. Both he and turney praised the police response. ( a youtube record was just almost broken. )",

The groundbreaking bones, about 2 million years old and unearthed in kenya, prove that there were at least two homo species — in addition to homo erectus — living simultaneously with each other before the dawn of modern homo sapiens, reports the new york times. \"human evolution is not this straight line it was once thought to be, \" says one paleoanthropologist, and east africa \"was quite a crowded place, with multiple species. \" the fossils were found between 2007 and 2009 ( by the mother-daughter leakey team ) and appear to hold the key to a mystery dating back to 1972, when a peculiar, unidentifiable skull, dubbed 1470, was located in the same area. The new fossils, which are remarkably similar to 1470, provide strong evidence that 1470 was not merely an odd-looking ancient human but a different offshoot of the homo genus.

Typically living alone or in pairs, a group of 10 to 15 is considered big, but research crews have now spotted super-groups as large as 200 on three occasions, they report in the journal plos one. Not only was it \" novel \" to spot so many humpbacks in one place, but the sightings took place in 2011, 2014, and 2015 off the southwestern tip of south africa in the fall, which is when they're typically hunting further south in antarctic waters, reports the smithsonian. \" i've never seen anything like this, \" lead author ken findlay tells new scientist. The team has posited some theories about what's going on, but it's still anyone's guess. The simplest one is that the practice isn't as rare as humans might think. \" it's possible that the behavior was occurring but just not where it was visible, \" says findlay. A variation of that suggests that this is an age-old practice of the whales, but it hasn't been visible because the humpback population was previously decimated by humans — that is, we saw them as loners merely because so few of them existed. Now that their numbers are bouncing back, that might be changing. Similarly, the increase in numbers might be forcing the whales to change up their usual hunting locales.

        "summary": "Don't have a lot of vacation days stockpiled but need to get away? consider taking a \" workcation \" — what the wall street journal describes as a growing trend in which workers head to a destination and pay for their own travel and lodgings, but don't get docked vacation days because they're actually doing work while sprawled on the beach or holed up in a remote mountain cabin. An employer may agree to an employee's workcation if she simply does some basic work tasks ( e.g., checking email, calling in for conference calls ) from the road. Or, if that's not enough, the employee could still put in regular workdays, then venture off to check out her destination in her off-hours. Besides, the journal notes, many american workers already feel compelled to check in with the office while on vacation, so why not make it official? but it turns out while it may work for some ( said pto-strapped employees ), some fear this alternative could come back to bite everyone in the sunburned bum. First, it won't be a viable option for every worker ( think salesmen who need to be in a specific territory to work ). Plus, there may be time zone differences to contend with, one worker pointed out to cbs miami after recently traveling the world with her portable workstation. And by perpetuating our constant need to check in, it may condition us to never fully log off from work, leading to burnout. \" it's not a good thing for employees who are vacationing to feel like they are always on an electronic leash, \" the president of a time-off advocacy group tells the paper.

        "summary": "Just how foul-mouthed was anthony scaramucci's tirade against his west wing enemies? the guardian is running a who-said-it quiz pitting his quotes against those of the comically foul-mouthed staff from veep. In the immediate aftermath of the story going public on thursday, scaramucci tweeted a mea culpa of sorts, promising to refrain from such \" colorful language \" in the future. And two hours after that, he suggested that he thought he was off the record. \" i made a mistake in trusting in a reporter, \" he tweeted. \" it won't happen again. \" fox news'sean hannity backed up the latter point: \" he told me he thought it was off the record, \" hannity said on his thursday night show, per the washington examiner. However, both the reporter involved and his publication, the new yorker, dispute that. \" scaramucci, who initiated the call, did not ask for the conversation to be off the record or on background, \" ryan lizza wrote in the original story. And a spokesperson for the magazine tells axios that \" scaramucci was clear and agreed that the conversation was on the record. \" neither of scaramucci's main targets, reince priebus and steve bannon, have responded publicly. But bannon's former publication, breitbart, offers a theory: \" there is absolutely no way that scaramucci could be stupid enough to make those comments on the record, so scaramucci, in a fit of rage about leaks about him, may have temporarily forgotten he was on the record. \" either that, or he figured lizza wouldn't run the volatile stuff. The piece also warns that scaramucci will be in trouble with president trump if the president thinks he ' ll damage the trump brand.",

South korea's defense ministry says a teenager reached a south korean guard post today in hwacheon and was taken into custody, per cnn. The dmz is among the world's most heavily militarized borders, guarded by tens of thousands of soldiers on either side, and strewn with land mines, electric fences, and barbed wire, reports the bbc. Most defectors leave north korea via china before making their way to south korea to avoid crossing the zone. Afp reports the defection \" sparked a tense stand-off between north and south korean border guards, \" but there was no exchange of fire. \" we've confirmed his will to defect after he reached our guard post, \" a ministry rep says. The unification ministry of south korea says 535 north koreans have defected to the south this year, but their number has fallen dramatically since kim jong un came to power; the new york times reports 1,397 defected last year, down from 2,706 in 2011. Though north korea hasn't addressed the defection, it did announce today that it would release two south korean citizens it said illegally entered north korea on may 11, reports cnn. South korea believes the pair, a male and a female, went missing while traveling near the north korean border in china. ( the last defector to cross the dmz said he killed two superiors. )",

With days that long, they can pack in a full year's worth of work in just six months — which is what many federal firefighters tend to work. And that makes them temporary employees, which causes a health-insurance catch-22. Per federal regulations, temporary employees of the forest service don't get health insurance. And they typically earn between $ 25,000 and $ 35,000 a year, the president of the national federal of federal employees explains, meaning that for many, \" the only way they can afford insurance is if they have a spouse that might be able to get coverage under an employer. \" the post talks to the 27-year-old member of a \" hotshot \" crew ( a sort of elite team ) who started a change.org petition clamoring for insurance.

The uk team is working with french, israeli, and uk experts in the search for the missing girls but nigerian forces seem to be giving up hope. \" we are tired of this whole thing because we are being killed every day and we don't get the required support and care from our superiors, \" a soldier tells reuters. A security source adds, \" it is time we removed the thought of a very happy ending to this situation. \"",

Nine big names have signed up to start, including the new york times, national geographic, and buzzfeed. They can sell ads on the articles themselves and keep all the revenue or have facebook sell the ads and split the money; the articles are hosted on facebook's servers. The feature, available only on iphones for now, \" is something more than a new user experience for opening the links you find on facebook, \" writes casey newton at the verge. \" it's a new publishing format. And it's one that publishers are going to take very seriously. \" some other reaction: lara o'reilly, business insider: \" this could be the future of news on the web, making news articles even easier to publish and share among facebook's vast audience. Or it could further hurt news publishers by stealing the business they have developed on the web and transferring it into an arena controlled by facebook. \" danny sullivan, marketing land: \" the bigger concern to me is that having a giant like facebook suck so much content effectively within its walled garden gives license for that other giant, google, to do the same.... My gut says if we eventually have both facebook and google offering to host everything in the name of speed and user experience, that's not a good thing. \" gabriel sherman, new york: this is a \" tectonic shift in the publishing industry, \" he writes, framing it mostly as a deal between facebook and the new york times. \" as much as anything, the facebook deal is a concession by times publisher arthur sulzberger jr.

This wasn't just auto-filling an online form — according to various recordings tweeted from the conference, this was a phone call between google's ai assistant and a human working at a salon. But more immediately, it might be able to make calls and book your appointments in a very-natural-sounding human voice, if a recent demo is to be believed. Google '",
            "Google ceo sundar pichai detailed a number of new google assistant features during his annual i/o keynote, the creepiest of which was an announcement that the voice assistant will be able to call up businesses on your behalf in the very near future. The reasoning behind the new feature is pretty sound. 60 % of small businesses in the us don't offer any form of online booking, so you have to call if you want to book a haircut at a hairdresser, or a table at a restaurant. But that's where it gets a little bit",
            "Onstage at i/o 2018, google showed off a jaw-dropping new capability of google assistant: in the not too distant future, it's going to make phone calls on your behalf. Ceo sundar pichai played back a phone call recording that he said was placed by the assistant to a hair salon. The voice sounded incredibly natural; the person on the other end had no idea they were talking to a digital ai helper. Google assistant even dropped in a super casual \"mmhmmm \" early in the conversation. Pichai reiterated that this was a real call using assistant",

Trump reportedly made the comment while meeting with senators about a bipartisan deal on immigration. It was suggested by republican sen. Lindsay graham and democratic sen. Richard durbin that protections for immigrants from africa, haiti, and el salvador could be restored in exchange for $ 1.5 billion for the border wall and eliminating the visa lottery system. Trump rejected that idea, saying the us should focus on getting immigrants from places like norway. The white house didn't deny trump made the reported remarks, instead issuing a statement that he would \" always fight for the american people. \" cnn reporter kaitlain collins tweets that white house staff aren't concerned about the \" shithole \" comment, as they believe trump's base will approve of it. Meanwhile, democrats are condemning the remarks. \" this is racism, plain and simple, and we need to call it that, \" democratic rep. Tim walz tweets. \" my republican colleagues need to call it that too. \" the times reports the incident shows how hard it will be to secure a deal for dreamers. Aides say trump seemed interested in a deal earlier thursday but had lost that interest by the time of the meeting. And a legislative aide to the president said afterward that a deal is far off.",

Santorum has taken to wearing the sleeveless v-necks while campaigning in iowa; the sartorial choice apparently first garnered attention at a des moines forum a few weeks ago during which most other candidates wore suits. \" it sort of took on a life of its own \" after that, he explains. \" so i started wearing more and more. My staff bought me a bunch more. \" they even, the new york times notes, had vests embroidered with his campaign logo. The vests have a twitter feed, facebook page, and music video ( watch at left ). Why does he wear them? in order to look older, he told laura ingraham yesterday, according to politico. Pointing out that he, at age 53, was mistaken for 32 while in iowa, santorum said, \" i ' m thinking the sweater vest makes me look a little older and that might be a good thing. \" but it's not all light news for santorum today: dana milbank wrote a particularly scathing piece on the candidate for the washington post, pointing out a number of santorum's errors and inconsistencies. Predicts milbank, \" he won't last long as a top-tier presidential candidate if he doesn't improve his game. \" click to read milbank's piece.",

The robot, which suffered some scratches, was the clear loser in the fight, though it was a rather one-sided affair since k5 doesn't have any arms. The droid got its revenge, however, by sounding its alarms, reports cnet. Knightscope rep stacy dean stephens says sylvain tried to flee when the alarms sounded, but was restrained until police arrived. A police rep says he was charged with prowling and public intoxication after officers noted he \"appeared confused, had red, glassy eyes and a strong odor of alcohol emitted from him. \" according to stephens, \" the robot did exactly as it was supposed to do — the ' assault ' was detected and immediately reported. \" the fact that sylvain was arrested is \" a testament to the technology, \" the company adds, per abc 7.

Jóhannesson — a history professor in a former life — last week stopped at a school in the northern town of akureyri and, during a q&a period, was asked about what iceland magazine frames as \" one of the more contentious debates of our times \": whether pineapple is an appropriate pizza topping. He not only replied in the negative but quipped that if he could unilaterally pass a law, he'd ban the fruit as a pizza topping altogether. Feathers were ruffled, leading the magazine to ask whether his stance could chip away at his sky-high approval ratings; in january a pollster found only 3.8 % of citizens view jóhannesson negatively, down from 6.4 % when he took office in august. On tuesday, jóhannesson took to facebook with a revised stance that clarifies he is no tropical fruit hater: \" i like pineapples, just not on pizza. I do not have the power to make laws which forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza. I am glad that i do not hold such power. Presidents should not have unlimited power. I would not want to hold this position if i could pass laws forbidding that which i don't like. I would not want to live in such a country. \" as for the kind of country he does want to live in, the guardian reports the 47-year-old's first moves in the position — turning down a 20 % pay bump; donating 10 % of his salary; and in a world first, marching in a gay pride parade as president — have been well regarded.

But one new study, published yesterday in plos medicine, puts the figure at 461,000. Researchers polled 2,000 households around the country to arrive at the figure, asking people to recall family deaths between 2003 and 2011. This data gave them an estimated 405,000 deaths; they projected that another 55,800 would have been reported by families who fled the country, al jazeera america reports. Of those who died, 60 % were estimated to have been killed in violence, with the remaining 40 % victims of things like damaged infrastructure and inaccessible medical care. \" i hope that one of the takeaways from this paper will be that when we invade a country, there are many health consequences that aren't directly related to violence, \" says one of the study authors, who predicts half of that 40 % was due to lack of treatment for heart disease. Another figure that might surprise: only 12 % of violent deaths were linked to bombings ( gunfire was the leading cause, at 63 % ). Of course, the study methodology is imperfect, though it has been regarded by many as better than the last attempt, which put the figure at 655,000. \" i think that the period of contention is over, and the focus now should not be on putting the blame on anyone, \" says the editor of the study, \"but on how do we figure out rebuilding the health structure in this environment. \"",

The notes and images — often showing the pontiff, who was made a saint in 2014, in casual wear — reveal a friendship between himself and american philosopher anna-teresa tymieniecka that included holidays spent together and an intimate relationship that historians are trying to figure out. \" here is one of the handful of transcendentally great figures in public life in the 20th century, the head of the catholic church, in an intense relationship with an attractive woman, \" a christianity history professor at cambridge university tells the bbc, which notes there's never a \" suggestion [ he ] broke his vow of celibacy. \" \" i would say they were more than friends but less than lovers, \" edward stourton, the documentary maker, tells afp, via deutsche welle. Tymieniecka, who was born in poland, first wrote to karol wojtyla in 1973 when he was still a cardinal, and their friendship deepened over the years. Stourton writes for the bbc that he believes tymieniecka first told wojtyla she was in love with him in 1975 and that it appeared the cardinal struggled with their relationship, writing that she was \" a gift from god \" and that \" if i did not have this conviction, some moral certainty of grace … i would not dare act like this. \" he also gave her a scapular — a piece of devotional clothing — that his own father had given him at his first holy communion. \" i was looking for an answer to these words, ' i belong to you, ' and finally, before leaving poland, i found a way — a scapular, \" he writes in a september 1976 letter. \" the dimension in which i accept and feel you everywhere in all kinds of situations, when you are close, and when you are far away. \" tymieniecka, who the bbc says visited the pope the day before he died in 2005, sold her letters to the polish library in 2008 and died in 2014, per the independent.

In the 80 years of records on such things, the previous season's high was five, reports ap. And the total doesn't count two other attacks in south carolina. In today's attack, the victim survived after a shark estimated to be 7 feet long dragged him under in waist-deep water and bit him repeatedly. He was able to swim to shore, reports wsoc, though there was no immediate word on his condition. Experts are floating several theories on what might be going on. One is that an especially hot june has caused fish to begin migrating north earlier than usual. Combine that with a general increase in beach attendance. \" so when you have more marine life in general in the water and then more people heading to the beach than usual, then you've got a potential recipe for accidents to happen, \" says a shark researcher at east carolina university.

Wgn counts at least 10 cars and suvs. Though none of the videos show the actual shooting, van dyke's squad car is seen following mcdonald through a burger king parking lot, jumping a curb to pursue him, and pulling up beside him in the center of the road where he was shot, per the tribune and cnn. Another view shows mcdonald shifting slightly on the ground as blood streams from his body. Just as with the first video, the new footage contains little to no sound. In-car video and audio is supposed to be activated when a vehicle's emergency lights are turned on. But there's no audio of officers talking inside the vehicles or on police radios. \" i don't think that audio does exist, \" chicago police superintendent garry mccarthy said tuesday. \" sometimes we have technical difficulties.

        "summary": "There are plenty of online resources for those looking to pour a perfect pint of guinness this st. Patrick's day, but it doesn't appear anyone behind the bar at vancouver's railtown cafe did their due diligence. Per the cbc, the canadian pub decided to advertise its celebrations for the irish-themed holiday, posting a pic on facebook of a guinness glass filled to the brim and literally losing its head, with foam leaking over the sides and onto the table — a move the irish independent called \" sacrilegious. \" \" @guinnessireland please do not supply anymore guinness to @railtowncafe just for this alone, \" read one incensed tweet. Pub owner dan olson concedes that the beer, which had been poured out of a can, looked like \" a budweiser in a tailgate commercial. \" olson notes the complaints came flowing in as fast, with one person even using good old-fashioned catholic guilt against them. \" ' [ the commenter ] actually said that jesus wept when he saw our pint of guinness, \" olson says, adding, \" we really annoyed an entire country. \" after taking their lumps, the folks at railtown have since shown that they listened to the masses, noting that staff does indeed know how to do a proper pour and posting a new photo on facebook with a much better-looking guinness glass to make up for the original \" blasphemous \" one. \" we're not all a bunch of maple-syrup drinking snow farmers, \" the post reads. In response to at least one comment that the new pour \" is not great either, \" the pub says it's looking into getting a guinness tap installed.

That means 100 % of blue tang bought by and for dory-loving children will come from the wild, and conservationists have no way of replacing them. \"i really think disney would not intend for their films to harm the actual animals their characters are based off, and adding a psa at the beginning of the movie would be such an easy way to help prevent that, \" kelsey bourgeois, who created the online petition, tells fox news.

        "summary": "In mid-september, rylea taylor and her two children survived a 70mph head-on collision in australia. But when rylea pulled 16-month-old jaxon out of the wreckage, she didn't need to be an expert to see her son's neck was broken. Indeed, his top two vertebrae were fractured, and both they and the boy's head were completely detached from jaxon's spinal column. Still, he was alive and somehow not paralyzed — though the slightest wrong movement could have permanently damaged nerves — so the doctor known as australia's \" godfather \" of spinal surgery, geoffrey askin, pulled off a six-hour operation at the lady cilento children's hospital in brisbane to reattach jaxon's skull to his spine. The story made headlines earlier this month — the brisbane times called it \" somewhat of a miracle, \" while a reuters story refers to the \" miracle baby \" — and now scientific american has new details on how askin's team managed it. Most people die from this \" internal decapitation \" because the brain signals that instruct the lungs to breathe don't reach their destination. With 68 % of victims dying before they are even diagnosed, and another 22 % in the hospital, jaxon was among the 10 % who survive. In children, high-speed car accidents cause 80 % of these upper spinal dislocations, askin says, with the secured child's head flung forward. Among the survivors, paralysis is the norm, but somehow the nerves in jaxon's spinal cord were intact. During surgery, a light, custom-made halo brace was screwed into his skull and the fragmented bones were carefully realigned. With surgical screws proving too large for jaxon's bones, surgeons used the \" primitive \" approach of rejoining the bones with wire. They also had to use a piece of one of the boy's ribs to fuse two vertebrae together. Now jaxon is able to walk, and, because he's still growing, he could recover fully. \" he's just really, really lucky, \" askin says.

        "summary": "Tesla wants to put its car and energy storage businesses under one solar-powered roof. Tesla said monday it will buy solar panel maker solarcity corp. In an all-stock deal worth $ 2.6 billion, the ap reports. The deal must still be approved by the government and shareholders at both companies. It's expected to close in the fourth quarter if it goes through. Thirteen-year-old tesla currently makes two luxury vehicles — the model s sedan and model x su — as well as powerwall and powerpack energy storage units for homes and businesses. Musk owns a 26 % stake in tesla motors inc., based in palo alto, california, and a 22.5 % stake in solarcity corp., which is based in nearby san mateo, california. Musk's cousins, lyndon rive and peter rive, run solarcity, which musk helped to found. Tesla said monday that a tie-up with solarcity would create a one-stop shop for cleaner energy. With one service call, customers could get their solar panels installed and connected to a powerwall, which preserves energy for later use. Users could also get the system hooked up to chargers for one of tesla's vehicles. \" this is really all part of solving the sustainable energy problem, \" said elon musk, the chairman and biggest shareholder of both companies, during a conference call. Vanity fair is painting the deal as \" a major step toward completing [ musk's ] master plan, \" while the los angeles times lays out the basics of that master plan: the merger \" aims to create a vertically integrated company with a nationwide network of retail stores that sell electric automobiles, rooftop solar systems, wall-mounted storage units for backup power in the home and electric charging stations that channel energy from the sun to the car — most of it manufactured by tesla itself. \"",

Ask their mexican lawyer ( and others ), however, and the response is: \" there are no problems. \" it's an odd case, with the same-sex couple saying they lost four years ' worth of savings not only on the process, but also through fraud: they claim their agent skipped out with money they paid for medical costs, which skyrocketed when one baby was born prematurely in what they say was a cockroach-infested hospital, per the yucatan times. The beards, who first ided themselves on stuff, also said they had to fund dna tests and travel to get the babies ' passports, gaynz.com notes. But leon altamirano, the beards'surrogacy lawyer, is skeptical of what they're saying. Although he admits that the couple seems to be out of funds to bring their sons and daughter home, he says they're exaggerating their story to play on people's sympathies and that all that's left to pay is document notarization, which would cost around $ 1,100 ( far less than the $ 19,000-plus donated on a fundraising page set up by a friend ). \" the truth isn't all there, \" altamirano tells the guardian. And their cancun surrogacy coordinator says the men knew that a premature birth wasn't covered by their contract. Meanwhile, another dad who went through a surrogate there says he met the couple and they raved about mexico and expressed fears about the costs of raising three kids. Both an official from the new zealand embassy and a rep for mexico's welfare agency tell the guardian the beards haven't approached them for assistance.

        "summary": "\" she was the last survivor of a story that gripped great britain and the world more than 50 years ago. \" so says the attorney for christine keeler to the guardian upon news of the 75-year-old's monday night death. She had been living under the last name sloane in an attempt to put more distance between herself and the profumo affair that she was so infamously and indelibly attached to. In 1961 keeler, then a young cabaret dancer working in london, met tory cabinet minister and rising political star john profumo — as well as russian military attache yevgeny ivanov. She began affairs with both men, and when the triangle came to light in 1963, it gripped britain, played upon cold war fears, and triggered events that led to the undoing of the harold macmillan government. The bbc reports keeler caught profumo's eye while \" splashing \" in a swimming pool at a party in buckinghamshire; she was 19, reports the washington post, and he was 46 and married. Their brief affair surfaced in a convoluted way: two other men fought over keeler, and one of them fired shots into a home where she was hiding. Police investigated, and keeler's connection to profumo ultimately became publicized. The ivanov angle led to fears of a security issue; when profumo was questioned by parliament, he characterized his relationship with keeler as platonic. Profumo ended up resigning after admitting he lied. An interesting note from the bbc: \" keeler later claimed she had been sleeping with ivanov at the same time as she was having an affair with profumo, but many commentators have since dismissed her account. \"",

Blogger ed morrissey at hot air sums up the democratic viewpoint toward sanders as \" keep campaigning... But for hillary. \" and he thinks that party leaders are probably on the mark with the strategy. \" perhaps hillary will offer sanders a cabinet post, such as hhs, where he can indulge all of his single-payer healthcare fantasies if hillary wins the election, \" he writes. \" but it may take a couple of more major-state blowouts to get the message through to bernie that it's over … and it's been over for a while. \" sanders, though, clearly disagrees.

A rep for developer millennium partners, which faces multiple lawsuits, adds the retrofit would make the tower \" one of the safest buildings in california. \" original developer mission street development has agreed to perform the work, with the funds coming out of an eventual settlement.

Before his stint with schweich, jackson had been in the employ of former gov.

That's after andy lafrate presented his pot-themed paper, which had three standout ( but not particularly worrisome ) findings: retail pot is way more potent, potentially less medically beneficial, and a little dirty. Lafrate runs charas scientific; it's one of eight labs certified to test recreational pot in the state, and what it found after examining 600 strains of marijuana from legally certified growers and sellers is that thc — the compound behind pot's \" high \" — is present in levels as high as 30 %, though nbc news reports the average is 18.7 %. In the ' 80s, it was usually below 10 %. As smithsonian explains, that isn't an accidental occurrence: growers have been crossbreeding strains in a bid to up the potency. Lafrate tells healthday it's not really a big deal, at least in terms of smoking, as smokers can just smoke less. But in that cross-breeding, cannabidiol — that's cbd, a compound that may benefit those suffering from everything from depression to alzheimer's — has nearly been bred-out. \" a lot of the time it's below the detection level of our equipment, \" says lafrate. The director of a nonprofit that tracks state marijuana laws isn't wowed by the finding, saying he expects retail pot would be heavy on the thc and light on the cbd. But lafrate noted that his lab has seen \" very little difference between recreational and medical in terms of the thc-to-cbd ratio, at least at the aggregate level. \" as for it being \" really dirty, \" his lab found fungus ( up to 1 million spores, in some cases ) on buds, and butane in some pot concentrates. \" there's going to be microbial growth on it no matter what you do, \" he notes. But \" what's a safe threshold? \" ( would you ever put your pet on pot? )",

So nate silver of the new york times decided to do the math and see just how much that would help santorum's cause. Based on public policy polling data, he estimates that 57 % of gingrich's supporters would back santorum, with 27 % backing romney. The number seems plausible but realistic, given that romney's opponents surged in the essentially one-on-one contests in missouri and virginia. But using that math, silver calculates that even if gingrich hadn't been in the race at all, santorum would still trail romney 264 delegates to 404. Gingrich dropping out and throwing his delegates to santorum would result in a similar total, and it would certainly help. \" but that would be just the first step, \" silver says.

But in recent months, two of the biggest casino owners in vegas launched systems to regulate the free alcohol being handed out to video poker players in their bars. And according to vital vegas, that means it's only a matter of time until similar systems are put in place at bars all over vegas before being rolled out to slot machines and beyond. Currently, the changes mean gamblers can no longer milk video poker games for cheap in order to drink for free, wgba reports. Mgm resorts started things off by deploying video poker machines in bars at the mgm grand and the mirage that print out drink vouchers when gamblers have been playing for long enough. It says the new machines take the pressure off bartenders to figure out who deserves to have their drinks comped. But the major sea change appears to be happening at caesars entertainment, which installed colored lights on the backs of video poker machines in the bars at all nine of its vegas-area casinos. If you bet the max — usually $ 1.25 or so — for four or five hands, the green light goes on and a free drink is headed your way. The red light will cut off the flow of gratis booze if you slow down your playing pace. \" you've got be willing to invest a little to get that free drink, \" roeben tells ktnv.

Trump, who says univision has no right to terminate the miss usa contract, tells politico that he believes the network is kowtowing to the mexican government. \" the government of mexico and the lobbyists and the special interests have put tremendous pressure on univision, a company that is very subservient to mexico, to get trump to stop exposing the terrible situation at the border and the terrible trade deals that are being made by the united states to the benefit of mexico, \" he says, referring to himself in the third person.

The first claimed the life of a man whose bedroom was above the sinkhole. That one was located less than two miles from sinkhole no. 3, which sits between two homes and was spotted by kids on saturday. Myfox tampa bay reports that the hole is 10 feet deep and 8.5 feet wide. The owner of one of the homes flanking the hole tells bay news 9 she panicked upon learning about it. \" i said, ' oh my god! ' i was thinking about the neighbors down the street... It's just very, very scary. \" of course, as bay 9 news notes, it wasn't scary enough to get her out of her own bedroom: she was issued a voluntary evacuation warning, and while she's \" kinda packing up stuff just in case we do need to leave \" she hasn't done so yet. The owner of the home across from her apparently had the property inspected for sinkholes in recent weeks. See a photo here.",

In the study titled \" selfies: a boon or bane? \" researchers published findings in the journal of family medicine and primary care that estimate some 259 people worldwide perished between october 2011 to november 2017 while attempting to take photos. The study came up with the number by looking at english-language news reports from across the globe. The data was broken down in some surprising ways. For instance, when countries were tallied separately, the data revealed that incidents in india accounted for 50 % of all reported selfie deaths, followed in prevalence by russia, the us, and pakistan, in that order. Drowning was found to be the most common cause. One such drowning occurred just last month when a selfie-taker plunged 200 feet off a cliff into lake superior. In july, a 19-year-old mormon missionary from utah suffered a similar fate in australia. About 72.5 % of victims were found to be males and half of all victims were between the ages of 20 and 29. Per fox news, such tragedies led study authors to conclude there's a need for \" no selfie zones \" around problem areas including \" water bodies, mountain peaks, and over tall buildings \" in order to warn prospective self-takers of the inherent dangers. \" selfies are themselves not harmful, but the human behavior that accompanies selfies is dangerous, \" wrote lead author agam bansal. \" individuals need to be educated regarding certain risky behaviors and risky places where selfies should not be taken. \"",
