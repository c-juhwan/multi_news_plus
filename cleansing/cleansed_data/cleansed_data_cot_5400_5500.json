        "summary": "A stanford study finds that kids from low-income families begin falling behind their richer peers in language development earlier than thought, reports the new york times. The study found clear differences at 18 months, with kids in the higher-income families able to identify simple words a lot faster. ( a previous study decades ago spotted differences at age 3. ) one new yardstick: it wasn't until the lower-income kids were 2 years old that they could match the speed of the richer 18-month-olds. That's presumably because the richer parents were more often talking to their children. \" these disparities are equivalent to a six-month gap between infants from rich and poor families in both language processing skills and vocabulary knowledge, \" the lead researcher told the standford report when the study surfaced last month. \" what we're seeing here is the beginning of a developmental cascade, a growing disparity between kids that has enormous implications for their later educational success and career opportunities. \" the results will likely come into play in the dc debate over the funding of prekindergarten programs, notes the times.",

            "\"that gap just gets bigger and bigger, \" said kris perry, executive director of the first five years fund, an advocate of early education for low-income children. \"that gap is very real and very hard to undo. \" video president obama has called for the federal government to match state money to provide preschool for all 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families, a proposal in the budget that congress voted to postpone negotiating until later this year. The administration is also offering state grants through its race to the top program to support early childhood education. Critics argue, however, that with so few programs offering high-quality instruction, expanding the system will prove a waste of money and that the limited funds should be reserved for elementary and secondary education. But at a time when a majority of public schoolchildren in about a third of the states come from low-income families, according to the southern education foundation, those who are pushing for higher preschool enrollment say that investing in the youngest children could save public spending later on.

The tampa bay times reports that kristen yaldor remains in intensive care in a south african hospital after she was attacked on the river by a hippopotamus, considered one of the most dangerous creatures in the world. Yaldor and her husband, ryan, were in zimbabwe to celebrate her 37th birthday, but as they floated down the river, their vessel apparently spooked a mother hippo, whose calf was hunkered down under the water's surface with her. The protective mama sent the yaldors ' canoe flying, and while ryan was able to make it to shore, kristen was dragged underneath the water by the upset animal, which clamped down on her leg and broke her femur. She finally got away, but it took at least an hour for a medical chopper to arrive, then 13 more to get to a hospital in neighboring south africa. Kristen is being painted by some local media as being a reckless us tourist who didn't heed instructions, with the sunday news quoting a witness as saying the yaldors got \" too close \" to the hippo ( it also misidentified her as \" christine \" yaldor ). But ryan says no one informed them a baby hippo may have been nearby or that they may have been in danger. He also notes their guide's cellphone and radio weren't functioning, which delayed help after the attack. His mom also disputes that he and his wife were to blame for what happened. \" the facts here are so distorted and misstated, \" martine yaldor tells the times, adding the two didn't do \" anything frivolous. \" ( a hippo killed a chinese tourist in kenya over the summer. )",

That was at least part of the nazi plan to destroy britain during world war ii, according to drawings of german weapons recently seen for the first time, the smithsonian reports. Among the drawings: a bomb hidden in a motor-oil can and a mess tin of bangers and mash that also held a bomb, per the bbc. Then there's the chocolate bar ( viewable in this tweet ), which was designed to detonate seven seconds after the chocolate was broken. The nazis reportedly hoped to assassinate winston churchill with such a bar by placing it amid items going into the war cabinet's dining room, according to a letter discovered in 2009, the telegraph reported three years ago. That 1943 letter was written by lord rothschild to artist laurence fish, who also made the drawings of various nazi booby-traps. Rothschild — \" a larger-than-life character, a scientist and self-appointed expert on many things, \" the bbc says — was also one third of mi5's counter-espionage unit, along with his secretary ( and future wife ) and police inspector donald fish. Rothschild wanted someone to draw the devices he was finding — in order to create a sort of manual for any brits who might encounter them — and fish recommended his son, laurence, a self-taught draughtsman, the gloucestershire echo reports. Long thought lost, the drawings turned up in the home of rothschild's daughter a few weeks ago. ( this author claims nazi soldiers were high on crystal meth. )",

        "summary": "Photos, mementoes, an urn on the mantel — there are many ways to remember a loved one who has died. Now a french company is offering a new one: the bottled scent of the recently departed, fusion reports. The product created by the firm kalain offers \" olfactory comfort \" in a time of mourning, the woman who started the company with her son tells afp. For katia apalategui, the quest to capture the scent of the dead began after her father died several years ago. \" i had a need, a special need — i wanted to keep his scent, \" she tells marketplace.org. Her mother had held on to a pillowcase with that scent, a unique one on account of factors such as his diabetic condition and even his dog, and the pillowcase gave apalategui the idea of bottling a person's odor. She partnered with a lab at the university of le harve to handle the science end of the undertaking. \"we take the person's clothing and extract the odor … and we reconstruct it in the form of a perfume in four days, \" says one of the researchers at the university. The details of the process are under wraps, but it involves extracting molecules from the fabric and turning them into the alcohol-based perfume, explains fusion. The theory behind it is that sensory cues can trigger memories and emotions, a process that psychology today attributes to our brain's anatomy. A bottle containing 10 milliliters of what fusion dubs \" eau de dead person \" comes in a box that has a spot for a photo of the deceased, a pocket scent diffuser, and a silk scarf bearing the initials of the loved one. The kit costs $ 609. Another kit is available for separations of a less extreme nature — think long-distance relationships. ( this perfume will make you smell better as you sweat. )",

        "summary": "Pummeling grains for up to five hours a day gave prehistoric women the kind of muscular arms a girl only dreams of today. That's according to researchers at cambridge university, who used ct scans to compare the upper arm and shinbones of 83 modern women with those of 94 women who lived in europe 7,400 to 1,200 years ago, during the neolithic period, bronze age, and iron age. The research is now highlighting a hidden history of \" rigorous \" but \" underestimated \" labor performed by women over thousands of years, researcher alison macintosh tells the guardian. According to her study in science advances, neolithic women had similar leg bone strength as modern women, but their arm bones were 30 % stronger than those of modern non-athletic women and 11 % to 16 % stronger than those of cambridge's champion female rowers. It's no wonder why: ancient women farmed before the invention of the plow. Their duties likely included planting and harvesting crops, grinding grains into flour, making pottery, tending livestock, \" processing milk and meat, and converting hides and wool into textiles, \" macintosh says, per the bbc, explaining in a release that bones evolve over time \" to accommodate repeated strain. \" strength for women eventually declined, likely as new technologies were introduced. During the bronze age, women's arm bones were 9 % to 13 % stronger than those of the rowers. By the middle ages, a woman's upper arm bone was about as strong as that of a modern woman, says macintosh, whose previous research identified a similar trend in the leg bones of men over time.

            "The intensification of agriculture is often associated with declining mobility and bone strength through time, although women often exhibit less pronounced trends than men. For example, previous studies of prehistoric central european agriculturalists ( ~5300 calibrated years bc to 850 ad ) demonstrated a significant reduction in tibial rigidity among men, whereas women were characterized by low tibial rigidity, little temporal change, and high variability. Because of the potential for sex-specific skeletal responses to mechanical loading and a lack of modern comparative data, women's activity in prehistory remains difficult to interpret. This study compares humeral and tibial cross-sectional rigidity, shape, and interlimb loading among prehistoric central european women agriculturalists and living european women of known behavior ( athletes and controls ). Prehistoric female tibial rigidity at all time periods was highly variable, but differed little from living sedentary women on average, and was significantly lower than that of living runners",

            "Durango biathlete tracy barnes did what she needed to do over the weekend to make the u.s. Olympic team. And then she made a huge sacrifice. With her twin sister, lanny, next in line, tracy turned down her olympic spot. \"in honor of friendship, cooperation and sacrifice, i declined my spot on the olympic team, \" tracy barnes wrote in an email to family and friends monday morning. So now lanny barnes, 31, will make her third trip to the winter olympics. She was officially named to the u.s. Biathlon team late sunday, along with four other women and five other men. In 2010 at the vancouver olympics, lanny placed 23rd in the 15-kilometer individual event – the best showing for a u.s. Woman biathlete since 1994. \"i can't even begin to describe what it means to me that tracy made such a huge sacrifice for me, \" lanny barnes said in an email to the herald monday afternoon from italy. \"we have been training together every day for the past 15 years and i know how hard she has worked to make this team. \" tracy and lanny both competed at the 2006 winter olympics in turin, italy. The twins have always worked as a team, whether it was training or setting goals. Both obviously had an eye on the olympics, but tracy made",

It shows true olympic spirit. The olympics are not always about gold medals, she showed that with her decision. \" tracy flew home to durango, colo. On tuesday.

        "summary": "It's been a busy weekend on the robert mueller front thanks to the firing of andrew mccabe, and both politico and the ap are taking note of a potentially big development: president trump is now going after mueller directly in tweets. The president has previously complained about the investigation but generally avoided direct shots at the special counsel. That changed this weekend. \" why does the mueller team have 13 hardened democrats, some big crooked hillary supporters, and zero republicans? \" he tweeted sunday. On saturday, he complained, \" the mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. \" and that same day, trump attorney john dowd urged the justice department's rod rosenstein to shut down the mueller investigation, though he later clarified that he was speaking for himself. Might all this suggest that trump is moving closer to firing mueller himself? \" it seems to be building toward that, \" said gop sen. Jeff flake on cnn, per the hill. \" i just hope it doesn't go there, because it can't. \" fellow gop sen. Lindsey graham echoed the sentiment, warning that firing mueller \" would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we're a rule-of-law nation. \" democratic rep. Adam schiff, meanwhile, pushed back on trump's allegation of \" hardened democrats \" on mueller's team. After all, he said, mueller himself is a republican, while his boss, rosenstein, and rosenstein's boss, jeff sessions, were appointed by republican presidents. ( there may be an unusual way for mccabe to qualify for his full pension benefits despite being fired. )",

More >> sometimes, it's good to be king — or in this case: just someone in the royal family. Clarence house recently released its annual review detailing the expenditures of prince charles and wife duchess camilla in the past year. According to the report, the future king doled out approximately $ 4.6 million to sons prince william and prince harry and daughter-in-law kate middleton as their allowance towards \"official activities. \" while the palace did not give out specifics as to how these funds were spent, it is said that the money were put towards paying staff, travel costs and the official wardrobe of the royals. As for charles, the 66-year-old paid for his expenses by drawing an income from the duchy of cornwall, an estate given to the heir to the throne to fund their official and private livelihoods. Per the report, charles received $ 31.1 million, which was a 1.7 percent rise from the previous income year. Both william, 33, and harry, 30, also received salaries for their respective jobs in the army. William and kate, 33, reportedly paid for the refurbishments and upkeep of their private home, anmer hall, privately.

This according to gallup, which has polled residents in 150 countries since 2009 in a quest to gauge how emotional each country is. It went about doing so by asking a series of yes-and-no questions designed to suss out whether a person had experienced positive or negative emotions ( sample: \" did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday? \" ). More \" yes \" answers translated into a more emotional country. In the case of singapore, only 36 % reported feeling emotions of any kind. The world leader in feeling emotions? the philippines, which had a 60 % emotional rating. The washington post analyzed the data by creating a color-coded map of the results, with max fisher calling the results \" as fascinating as they are indecipherable. \" among his conclusions: post-soviet countries are far from emotional: aside from singapore, madagascar, and nepal, the top 10 least emotional countries was comprised of ex-soviet union countries. On the flipside, the americas dominate: the only countries in the top 15 most emotional countries not from north or south america are the philippines, oman, and bahrain. There are odd anomalies: haiti is far more emotionless than its neighbors; the reverse is true for angola. Gallup also looked at the positive/negative breakdown: panama, paraguay, and venezuela lead in positive emotions, while iraq, bahrain, and the palestinian territories were at the bottom of the list.",

That means retailers may be forced to increase prices or shipping fees, though they might also promote a ship-to-store option since the new fees only apply to residential deliveries. From nov. 19 to dec. 2, ups will add a 27-cent charge to ground packages for residential deliveries. That's an increase of about 3.4 % over last year, per bloomberg. That fee will also apply from dec. 17 to dec. 23, along with an extra 81-cent charge for next-day air delivery and a 97-cent charge for two- or three-day delivery, per the journal. Ups says the fees will offset the costs of thousands of seasonal workers, plus the extra planes and trucks needed to deliver more than 30 million packages a day, almost double its average for the rest of the year, per npr.

The remains of us-made, laser-guided bombs have been found in the wreckage of multiple deadly airstrikes — including an attack on a funeral last month, which killed 140 people. A saudi-led arab military coalition intervened to support yemen's government after houthi rebels backed by iran took over the capital city of sanaa and drove the government into exile in 2014. With the iranian military supporting the houthis, and the saudi-led coalition supporting the government, the conflict quickly ground to a stalemate. As the fight rages on, the nyt reports, the saudi coalition has taken to targeting bridges, ports, and other infrastructure targets — often with american-made bombs. Saudi arabia purchased almost $ 4 billion of military equipment and construction services from the us in 2014, according to factcheck.org. And in august of this year, the us state department approved a new sale of $ 1.15 billion in military equipment to saudi arabia, reuters reports. The us defense security cooperation agency said the sale \" conveys us commitment to saudi arabia's security and armed forces modernization. \" the sale occurred right around the time saudi arabia was intensifying its air campaign within yemen. Despite concerns from human-rights groups, the us state department refused to address the concern that the weapons would be used against civilians in yemen, the guardian reports. A state department spokesperson would only say: \" we regularly talk to our partners and our allies around the world. You know, civilian casualties are obviously of grave concern to us. \"",

The shooter has been identified as ronald anderson, and police say the woman he kidnapped was his girlfriend. Two months ago, anderson was charged with assault for allegedly beating her, and he had been due in court today — his 48th birthday — for a hearing on the case. Yesterday afternoon, however, authorities say he forced her into his car at gunpoint, then drove to the census bureau for unknown reasons, reports the washington post. Security guard lawrence buckner, 59, heard them arguing, approached the car, and was fatally shot. Anderson then dropped off his girlfriend unharmed at some point before leading police on a chase that included an exchange of gunfire and anderson crashing his vehicle. He remains hospitalized with multiple gunshot wounds, reports wusa9. A police officer is recuperating from a gunshot wound to the leg. The ap, meanwhile, has details from the assault charges in february, citing the responding officer's report: \" the victim was shaking, crying and was whispering while speaking because she was afraid of the suspect hearing her. \" anderson's girlfriend told the officer that he had hit her several times after accusing her of looking at another man.

        "summary": "Are superbugs about to meet their match? there hasn't been a major new antibiotic discovered in 25 years, but researchers say a drug called teixobactin that has been extracted from dirt in maine could be the biggest breakthrough in a generation, fast company reports. The experimental drug has so far only been tested on mice, but the tests have showed it to be stunningly effective. \" teixobactin kills exceptionally well. It has the ability to rapidly clear infections, \" says the lead author of a study published in nature. The drug not only cured mice of staph infections, it attacked multiple targets in a way that will make it tough for bacteria to develop resistance, meaning it could remain effective for decades. Producing new antibiotics is a slow process: researchers hope to begin human trials within two years, and if the drug passes all the tests, it could be available in five or six years, reports the new york times. With antibiotic-resistant superbugs killing hundreds of thousands of people a year worldwide, experts say the breakthrough was desperately needed — and they believe the process used to screen 10,000 soil bacteria for new compounds could yield more discoveries. \" what most excites me is the tantalizing prospect that this discovery is just the tip of the iceberg, \" a professor of infectious diseases at the university of edinburgh tells the guardian. \" it may be that we will find more, perhaps many more, antibiotics using these latest techniques. \"",

Federal prosecutors accused shkreli, 32, of perpetuating a ponzi-like scheme on investors in former hedge funds he led, as well as at retrophin ( rtrx ), a pharmaceutical company he founded and previously headed. Authorities said shkreli misappropriated funds, lied about investment returns and conspired to defraud retrophin by secretly issuing company stock to settle disputes with burned investors. The criminal indictment handed up in brooklyn, new york accused evan greebel, 42, a new york lawyer who served as retrophin's outside counsel, of aiding the alleged scheme. The securities and exchange commission on thursday filed parallel civil charges against shkreli. Glad to be home. Thanks for the support. — martin shkreli ( @martinshkreli ) december 18, 2015 after pleading not guilty at a thursday arraignment, shkreli denied all of the allegations and issued a statement saying he expects to be vindicated. \" it is no coincidence that these charges, the result of investigations which have been languishing for considerable time, have been filed at the same time of shkreli's high-profile, controversial and yet unrelated activities, \" shkreli spokesman craig stevens said in the statement.

        "summary": "President trump formally goes before the nation at 9pm edt monday — his first such forum since addressing a joint session of congress in february — to lay out his strategy for the war in afghanistan. The big expected takeaway: an announcement of an increase in troops with the goal of reversing recent gains by the taliban — the los angeles times puts the figure at about 4,000. In return, the afghan government will be asked to clamp down on corruption, among other things. Trump also is expected to make clear that this is not an open-ended war, without providing specifics for a us drawdown. Related coverage: significance: putting forth his own strategy is a \" turning point \" for trump because it means he takes ownership of the us involvement in the conflict, notes the wall street journal. In 2013, as he was pondering a run for president, trump tweeted that the us should pull out quickly and use the money to \" rebuild the u.s.! \" generals happy: after a monthslong assessment, trump seems to have sided with his military commanders, with defense chief james mattis pronouncing himself satisfied with the \" rigorous \" review, reports the new york times. Opponents in the steve bannon camp had argued that the us should pull out and perhaps let private contractors fight the battle. Riches: trump has his eye on valuable minerals under the afghan soil, perhaps as much as $ 1 trillion worth of copper, iron, and other metals, reports foreign policy. He recently met personally with michael silver, ceo of american elements, and heard the mining pitch. \" trump wants to be repaid, \" says one source, referring to the billions that the us has spent in the nation. \" he's trying to see where the business deal is. \" key quote: axios reports that mattis has been using this line in meetings: \" mr. President, we haven't fought a 16-year war so much as we have fought a one-year war, 16 times. \" that is, he thinks the us has been lacking a coherent, big-picture strategy. Pakistan: part of the broad new strategy is expected to involve a tougher new policy toward pakistan, seen as supporters of the taliban, perhaps in the form of less us funding to the country. One reason the decision has taken so long has been the need to convince trump of this shift toward pakistan, reports reuters. Current numbers: the us now has 8,400 troops in afghanistan, and nato has an additional 5,000. Their main duty is to train and advise the afghan army, along with providing artillery and air support.

So says former gourmet editor ruth reichl to the new york times about a growing culinary niche: cooking with cannabis. Adventurous chefs are excited to create novel dining experiences, as are culinary scientists toiling to make pot more palatable and control its mood-changing effects — two of the biggest challenges in cooking with it. Cooking with cannabis won't be totally mainstream until \" you can give it to someone and not make them a complete idiot, \" cookbook author michael ruhlman tells the times. But into the mainstream is where it's coming: once the domain of the high times kitchen and insider instructionals like the stoner's cookbook, there's now a weed-butter recipe on gizmodo, a vice marijuana cooking show, a buzzfeed recipe listicle, and even a vogue editor who's cooked with pot. The movement is growing like a weed, with \" major new york publishing houses \" considering cannabis-themed cookbooks, and underground pot-infused meals served up by chefs here and abroad, the times notes. \" it really won't be long until it becomes part of haute cuisine and... Respectable culinary culture, instead of just an illegal doobie in the backyard, \" the director of the food studies program at the university of the pacific tells the times. And by appealing to those discriminating diners \" to appreciate dishes with marijuana the way one appreciates good bourbon, \" the times notes, chefs can capture a lucrative market: the chief executive of the stoner's cookbook predicts that $ 10.2 billion is what the legal pot industry will be worth in five years; edible marijuana could command 40 % of that share.

That's the idea behind clemson university's \" indigo pine \" design — one of 14 houses presented at this year's us department of energy solar decathlon in irvine, calif. More than 100 students worked for two years on the project, which touts itself as a home that's stronger than most ( though it's held together with tab-and-slot connections and some screws and stainless steel zip ties ) and can be built in just days, according to a release. Inhabitat explains how the process of building the 970-square-foot, 3-bedroom, 1.5-bath home would work for consumers: digital files \" are sent to a local cnc machine which mills over 500 pieces of standardized-sheets of plywood into smaller interlocking pieces. \" once shipped to the construction site, the numbered pieces can be assembled like a \" 3d puzzle. \" wall cavities leave room for insulation, while the exterior is clad in a reflective coating that helps beat the heat. The house also sits on a \" concrete lung \" foundation of concrete masonry units so air can circulate underneath. The whole thing is powered by photovoltaic panels and a solar hot water system. \" our team has invented an energy-efficient, strong, simple system called simply — the construction of which is faster, safer, easier, and more energy-efficient than traditional construction with power tools, \" the director of clemson's school of architecture says, calling the zero-energy home the \" beta version of what could be a market-rate, flat-packed house that could be ordered online, custom-cut, and then constructed by do-it-yourselfers. \"",

That works out to nearly $ 275 a year, or just over $ 3,000 over the course of the experiment.

As with the dispute over his end-of-life care between his kids and kasem's, wife, jean, the story is a little convoluted. Daughter kerri got a temporary restraining order this week to prevent jean from having his remains cremated, but when her lawyer delivered it to the funeral home in tacoma that was supposed to have kasem's body, the home informed the lawyer that the body was no longer there, reports ap.

The problem is that funeral home says it has no record of that happening. \" pure insanity, \" kerri kasem's lawyer tells the la times.

A team is looking at opportunities in tourism, construction, energy and agriculture, among other industries, and will make recommendations to the palestinians, he added. Experts believe the plan could increase the palestinian gdp by as much s 50 % over three years and cut unemployment to 8 % from 21 %, kerry said. The initiative is supported by both israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and palestinian president mahmoud abbas. \" now, is this fantasy? i don't think so, because there are already great examples of investment and entrepreneurship that are working in the west bank, \" kerry told the crowd, which included abbas and israeli president shimon peres. \" so we know it can be done, but",

        "summary": "Washington may not have \" boots on the ground \" in iraq, but it still recorded the first death of a serviceman in the fight against isis — 19-year-old marine lance cpl. Sean neal, the washington post reports. The california native reportedly died in baghdad in what the pentagon is calling a noncombat incident. The military divulged no further details but says it is investigating neal's death, the marine corps times reports. Neal was on his first deployment as part of a new crisis-response group under us central command; most of the group's 2,300-strong force are stationed in kuwait, but neal was one of the 150 assigned to guard us facilities in iraq, the la times reports. Neal's death is officially the first among servicemen fighting isis, although another marine — cpl. Jordan spears — was lost at sea in the persian gulf earlier this month. Spears was in a marine unit that also played a part in battling the islamic state. Meanwhile, british forces pulled out of afghanistan today as they and us marines gave the afghans two huge military bases, reuters reports. \" we gave them the maps to the place, \" says a marine commander. \" we gave them the keys. \" about 12,500 troops will stay behind — 9,800 of whom are american — mostly to advise and train afghans in their ongoing fight against the taliban.",

Marines handed over two huge adjacent bases to the afghan military, 13 years after a u.s.-led invasion launched the long and costly war against the taliban. Their coming departure leaves afghanistan and its newly installed president, ashraf ghani, to deal almost unaided with an emboldened taliban insurgency after the last foreign combat troops withdraw by year-end. At the u.s. Camp leatherneck and britain's camp bastion, which lie next to each other in the southwestern province of helmand, troops lowered the american and british flags for the final time on sunday and folded them away. The timing of their withdrawal has not been announced for security reasons. Camp leatherneck, the largest u.s. Base to be handed over to afghan control, and camp bastion together formed the international coalition's regional headquarters for the southwest of afghanistan, housing up to 40,000 military personnel and civilian contractors. But on sunday, the base resembled a dust-swept ghost town of concrete blast walls, empty barracks and razor wire.

The philadelphia couple that helped crowdfund more than $ 400,000 to help a homeless man is now being accused by that man of using the money as their \" personal piggy bank, \" with johnny bobbitt jr.'s legal team saying that all of the money raised by kate mcclure and mark d ' amico for bobbitt is now gone. But gofundme, the site via which the crowdfunding took place, says that bobbitt will be \" made whole \" and that he ' ll receive the full amount of what was raised, nj.com reports. \" we're committing that he ' ll get the balance of the funds that he has not yet received or benefitted from, \" gofundme said in a joint statement with the law firm repping bobbitt. That balance is still being debated. A lawyer for mcclure and d ' amico, who say they withheld some of the cash from d ' amico because they feared he'd spend it on drugs, claims bobbitt has already received $ 200,000, while bobbitt's lawyer says his client has only seen $ 75,000 of it, per the philadelphia inquirer. A gofundme rep says bobbitt will get what he's due because of the gofundme guarantee, \" which means that in the rare case that gofundme, law enforcement, or a user finds campaigns are misused, donors and beneficiaries are protected. \" the inquirer gets into the nitty-gritty of the site's donations protocol, noting the site is also making the rare exception of allowing people who donated to ask for refunds, even though the normal 30-day deadline has expired.

Of course, there's a catch: you have to chug a 12-ounce beer every lap ( for a total of four ) without vomiting; if you lose your lager on the track, you have to do a penalty lap or be disqualified, the new york times explains. More than 150 runners were competing today in the first world championship devoted to this imbibing endeavor in austin, texas, with competitors vying to beat the current beer-mile world record of 4: 57 set by james \" the beast \" nielsen. Contenders can quaff any beer, as long as it contains at least 5 % alcohol ( according to beermile.com, the most popular running brews are bud, pbr, and miller high life ). Jim finlayson, a 42-year-old runner from british columbia, tells the times he trains for the sport — which is believed to have been started in either canada, indonesia, or us colleges in the ' 80s, beermile.com notes — by setting an alarm for the middle of the night, then gulping down a bedside container of carbonated water as fast as he can when it goes off; he ' ll also hold his breath for 60 seconds, then drink a pint before gasping for oxygen. The races are often held in the dark to flout local open-container rules and also — inexplicably, the times notes — in cold weather. Don't feel bad if this all sounds dreadfully horrible to you: lance armstrong dropped out after just one lap in a qualifying run, saying, \" that was not what i expected, \" as per the times.

Other days, gallagher, a 27-year-old mailman in winnipeg, manitoba, turns his treadmill to top speed for a mile and downs four bottles of beer — one per quarter-mile — each in less than eight seconds.

Delaney, 54, made the announcement with an op-ed in the washington post. \" it is time for us to rise above our broken politics and renew the spirit that enabled us to achieve the seemingly impossible, \" he writes. He says he believes he has an \" original approach to governing \" that will work for the american people and touts his \" blue-collar family \" and his past as a \" successful entrepreneur \" and job creator. The baltimore sun reports delaney started a company that loaned money to nursing homes and doctors and founded a commercial and retail bank. At 32, he became the youngest ceo in the history of the new york stock exchange. Delaney will have an uphill battle to the presidency for multiple reasons. For one, the democratic party may be moving leftward too quickly for delaney to keep up. Despite describing himself as progressive, his reputation in the house is as a bipartisan centrist. He opposes the $ 15 minimum wage and supported the trans-pacific partnership, cnn reports. He also isn't well-known nationally — though being able to spend millions of his own fortune on his campaign could help with that. Delaney's early announcement for president is a sign of two things: pretty much every democrat in elected office thinks they can beat trump, and the race for the democratic nomination could be wide open with joe biden, bernie sanders, and elizabeth warren all potentially sitting out.",

Authorities say albert wong, 36, a decorated army rifleman, crept into the veterans home of california-yountville with a high-powered rifle and held three mental health workers hostage for hours before killing them and himself, the press democrat reports. The victims were christine loeber, 48; jennifer golick, 42; and jennifer gonzales, 29, who worked at a post-traumatic stress disorder program that had recently expelled wong. \" three innocent souls gave their all and are no longer with us, \" says vito imbasciani, secretary of the california department of veterans affairs. Wong slipped onto facility grounds at around 10am, exchanged fire with a sheriff's deputy, and then quiet — despite the swarm of law enforcement officers that lay siege and tried contacting him, the ap reports. The bodies were found about eight hours later. As for wong, he had served three years in the infantry and garnered four medals, including a campaign medal in afghanistan with two campaign stars. \" like many of our young men ( in the military ), he did see some rough times, \" says a woman who became wong's legal guardian. Now authorities are trying to digest what happened. \" i feel sick to my stomach. I feel sick to my heart, \" says rep. Mike thompson of st.

But reuters takes note of a column by kirill martynov in the independent newspaper novaya gazeta in which he chastises people for thinking that if putin dies, democratic reform would follow without any effort on their part. \" it's not putin that has died, \" he wrote. \" it's you, if you think that his death will make you more free. \" at vox, amanda taub says all the goofy rumors don't deserve attention, but something else does: the lack of a clear succession plan. It's not about who would take his office, but who would take his power. \" it is easy to mistake putin's personal control over the levers of power in russia for a sign of strength, \" she writes.

But this isn't the first time rumors of this kind have caught on — and the fact that he can't cancel a couple of meetings without causing a frenzy of speculation hints at a deeper truth about russia and the state of putin's regime. These rumors stem from fear and uncertainty about what happens after putin. No one knows who would assume power if he died, got sick, or otherwise left office.

In fact, henry suffered at least three documented blows to the head, twice in his 30s and then again in his 40s when a horse fell on him during a jousting match. He apparently lost consciousness for two hours in the latter case, and \" historians agree his behavior changed after [ the horse fell on him in ] 1536, \" says salardini, who adds that henry was often portrayed as smart and even-tempered in his youth. It wasn't until his 40s that he became \" cruel, petty, and tyrannical, \" the study reads, per the washington post. An example of his erratic behavior: in 1546 he verbally berated the soldiers who came to arrest his sixth wife, catherine parr; he had forgotten he ordered them to do so the previous day. \" this brings into perspective that traumatic brain injury isn't a fringe sort of condition, and that it isn't new or invented, \" salardini tells the connecticut post. \" it has incapacitated people throughout all of history. \"",

While training faculty members back in march on what to do should a gunman come into their classroom, police chief mark gordon advised them to be ready to throw something at the shooter if they couldn't run away or hide, since the school has a no-weapons policy. As a last resort, throw something, anything, he said — even a hockey puck.

A professor led a union effort to purchase 2,500 of the pucks at 94 cents apiece, and the school started handing them out earlier this month. Some students tell wxyz the idea of puck-as-defense is \" absurd, \" but they serve another purpose: they're imprinted with a number that can be entered on the university's website to donate money toward a campaign to install interior locks on classroom doors; the student body vp says the pucks are raising awareness about that need. As for the pucks themselves, \" it's just the idea of having something, a reminder that you're not powerless and you're not helpless in the classroom, \" says the professor who led the effort. Gordon says \" anything that has weight \" would work in a similar way, including staplers and laptops, noting that if 20 or 30 people in a classroom were to all throw their pucks simultaneously, \" it would be quite the distraction. \" ( a pennsylvania district handed out baseball bats. )",

Before the report from the labor department was released on friday, goldman sachs had estimated the weather could drag down payroll gains by 30,000 to 60,000. Some economists also have said the outsize job gains early this year defied a low unemployment rate, which means businesses face a shrinking pool of available workers. Many analysts",
            "Stocks appear to be taking their queue from falling benchmark rates in early going friday after the release of the jobs report. While financials are the worst-performing s&p 500 sector, telecom, real estate, and utilities are up the most. Those sectors typically rise when yields fall because they pay high dividends that look more attractive in low-rate environments. The s&p and dow are both up 0.1 % as the session kicks off. The mixed jobs report sent treasury yields lower, but hasn't weighed on the stock market at all.",
            "Washington ( ap ) — u.s. Employers added just 98,000 jobs last month, the fewest in a year, though the unemployment rate fell to an almost seven-year low of 4.5 percent. The labor department says the unemployment rate fell because nearly a half-million more americans found jobs. The number of people working and the new job count are done by separate surveys. Economists had expected a fall-off in hiring after job gains in january and february had averaged a robust 237,000. Those increases had been fueled partly by strong hiring in construction, which occurred because of unseasonably warm weather. Construction firms added 6,000 jobs in march, the fewest in seven months. Retailers, suffering from the ongoing shift to online shopping, slashed 30,000 jobs. Education and health care services added the fewest jobs in 15 months."

        "summary": "We are a country awash in juice — the fancy, unpasteurized, kale-filled version, that is. Writing for slate, katy waldman points out that \" juice \" is both a verb and a $ 5 billion industry, fueled by celebs who swear by the health trend, which finds its apex in that most admirable of all consumption options: the juice cleanse. Those on these programs eschew all solids for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks and drink juice roughly six times a day, with goals ranging from flushed toxins to hydrated cells to shinier hair to ( though few will admit it ) weight loss. Except juice cleanses achieve no such objectives, per waldman. \" they fetishize a weird, obsessive relationship with food, and they are part of a social shift that reduces health to a sign of status. \" also, \" they're annoying as hell. \" a quick recap of waldman's debunking, via the mouths of nutritionists: we need protein. We need fat. Out kidneys and livers were designed to rid the bodies of toxins. And juicing strips fiber from fruits and vegetables, and fiber is what feeds the gut's microflora. \" lol! let's obsess over how immaculate we can make our insides even though our intestines host trillions of bacteria, \" waldman scoffs. She goes on to explore juicing as a gateway to — or cover for — eating disorders. Writing in new york, vanessa grigoriadis referenced \" a lightheaded superiority to mortals, \" and that, writes waldman, \" is a huge part of what makes some eating disorders so hard to shake, because it becomes part of your identity. \" waldman points out \" one final piece of odiousness in juice cleanses: \" with juices costing $ 10 a bottle, the cleanse's \" purity and excellence is inevitably tied to wealth... Only available to the well-heeled. \" click for her full column.",

The plan follows a surprise deal on greenhouse-gas emissions announced during obama's visit to beijing last year, and the new york times notes that it will undercut republican arguments that there is little point in the us trying to combat climate change when china refuses to take action.

The vote was 4-3, per the new york times, as the late antonin scalia's seat remains empty and justice elena kagan had recused herself because she'd previously been involved with the case as us solicitor general. \" it remains an enduring challenge to our nation's education system to reconcile the pursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity, \" justice anthony kennedy wrote for the majority. \" in striking this sensitive balance, public universities … can serve as ' laboratories for experimentation, ' \" he added, though noting that \" it is the university's ongoing obligation to engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies. \" this was the second time the case, brought by abigail fisher after she was denied admission in 2008 to the school's austin campus, was seen by the high court: it made its way before the supreme court bench in 2013, but it was bumped back to a lower appeals court to review the lawsuit once more ( that court once more backed up the university ). Many experts didn't expect the case to go the way of the affirmative action camp. \" the decision itself is written quite narrowly, and tailored to the ut program specifically, \" a law professor at the american university washington college of law tells cnn. \" but it's safe to assume that public universities across the country will now look at this ruling as a roadmap for how to constitutionally take race into account. \" chief justice john roberts was joined in his dissent by justices clarence thomas and samuel alito, who wrote the decision seemed \" strange \" and that the court was acting \" inexplicably \" in its ruling.",

Shawn and caid sellers and their cousin michael mahalitc became dinosaur hunters — in a sense. While walking through a plowed area on their family's property in bovina, the boys uncovered a relic from earth's ancient history; the lower left jawbone of a mastodon. \"i just saw it in the dirt, \" caid said. \"i thought it was a log, then i turned it over and saw the teeth. It was heavy. I tried to lift it.

The \" wayward \" younger brother of the country's king philippe claims his human rights are being violated, and the guardian reports the mess apparently relates to his purported penchant for making announced visits with foreign officials — in the democratic republic of the congo, libya, and sri lanka, previously — and a proposed punishment related to that. The recent issue dates to july, when laurent attended the 90th anniversary of the red army at the chinese embassy in brussels in full naval dress, in defiance of a ban on him meeting with foreign dignitaries without the government's ok. The telegraph reported the 53-year-old himself publicized his presence there by tweeting photos of the event to his roughly 5,000 followers. Prime minister charles michel set up a meeting with laurent to discuss it, and the media reported laurent's annual government endowment, which is currently about $ 375,000, could be slashed up to 15 % as a penalty. Laurent was a no-show for the meeting, instead sending a 7-page letter that claimed the ban on such meetings was in violation of the european convention on human rights as it would cause forced \" social isolation. \" the letter alleged that publicizing the potential punishment was illegal, and \" that the court of human rights would make short work of such violations of the right to a fair trial. \" cutting his endowment would \" deprive him and his family of all livelihoods, \" he argued.

Which is all rather neat, except for a couple of things: first, it sounds somewhat emotionless — or as vocativ puts it, \" a bit like the beatles on anti-depressants \" ( and honestly, the harmonies hover close to beach boys territory, too ). Digital trends also points out that it muddles what's considered original music and what's not, meaning the technology \" could either be seen as a threat to musicians \" or prove to be a viable tool that supplements human creativity.

Who might have sct? think kids prone to daydreaming or staring off into space, according to an earlier article in medscape. Other characteristic symptoms include being \" mentally foggy \" or \" easily confused, \" along with lethargy and \" slow mental processing. \" leading sct researchers think 2 million kids could be affected, though that figure includes 1 million kids currently diagnosed with adhd, notes the times. Those numbers, of course, could mean big business for big pharma, which could theoretically tweak existing adhd drugs to treat sct. And, yes, plenty of skepticism abounds. \"we're seeing a fad in evolution: just as adhd has been the diagnosis du jour for 15 years or so, this is the beginning of another, \" complains a psychiatry professor at duke. \"this is a public health experiment on millions of kids. \" a ucla professor similarly urges restraint in the medical community because some parents will be sure to embrace the diagnosis and demand meds. At this point, lots more research is needed before sct could be officially recognized as a distinct disorder of its own, but a doctor at the medical university of south carolina who co-authored a study calls it an \" exciting new frontier in psychiatry. \" she hopes, however, that a \" less pejorative \" name than \" sluggish cognitive tempo \" eventually emerges.

That figure is outrageous for a reason other than that you might think. As nbc news reports, penis pumps, more properly known as vacuum erection systems, are actually one of the \" few viable treatment courses \" for men with erectile dysfunction, per the national institutes of health. So it's not the coverage of the item for some 474,000 men over those six years that's the problem, but the amount that was spent: each claim cost medicare an average $ 361 — more than double what the pump would have cost if the user just bought it online. ( and oig verified this by... Googling. It reports that \" research on 22 different web sites yielded pricing information for 105 ves... The average internet price... Was $ 164.74. \" ) and if medicare had adjusted its \" grossly excessive \" coverage amount to be in line with what a non-medicare consumer pays ( and, the report noted, what the department of veterans affairs pays ), the government would have spent an average of $ 14.4 million less per year for each of the years under review, reports reuters. And the savings wouldn't end there. Beneficiaries are responsible for 20 % of the cost of the pump, plus any unmet deductible, which worked out to an average $ 90; a medicare fee adjustment would have saved them roughly $ 3.6 million a year. It could have come to pass, had the issue been dealt with when it previously came up — in 1999, when the centers for medicare and medicaid services suggested changing the ves fee schedule, reports the washington free beacon.

In a series of tests, the magazine found new products containing chemically synthesized compounds similar to or derived from natural ingredients performed better than repellants containing deet that, in the past, have always topped all other competitors. Researchers tested 15 pump sprays and aerosol repellants on the forearms of participants ( dubbed the \" swat team \" ), then watched as they either stuck their arms in a box with 200 hungry, disease-free mosquitoes or had deer ticks unleashed on them. The highest-scoring products were made of 20 % picaridin — which resembles a compound in black pepper plants — or 30 % oil of lemon eucalyptus, and repelled bugs for a minimum of six hours. Though both ingredients can cause minor injury or irritation, \" those problems are much less severe than ( with ) deet, \" which can cause rashes or even seizures, an expert says. Sawyer fisherman's formula made with picaridin scored highest, protecting against mosquitoes and ticks for eight hours, while repel lemon eucalyptus stopped ticks for eight hours and mosquitoes for seven hours, time reports. Researchers note concentration is key as a repellant containing 5 % picaridin performed rather poorly. The tests showed deet products are also effective, though a 15 % deet spray performed better than a 25 % product, perhaps due to other ingredients. If you do choose a deet spray, researchers say it should contain no more than 30 % deet.

        "summary": "The ( potentially ) former prime minister of lebanon's mysterious two-week stay in saudi arabia has come to an end, as saad hariri arrived in france on saturday morning and met with french president emmanuel macron, the new york times reports. Hariri was in saudi arabia on nov. 4 when he suddenly and shockingly resigned as prime minister. Since then, lebanese president michel aoun has refused to accept his resignation among widespread speculation hariri was being held in saudi arabia against his will, according to the ap. Early saturday, hariri tweeted that it was a \" lie \" that saudi arabia was detaining him. However, speculation of saudi leverage continues as hariri was joined by his wife and eldest son in france while his younger children — attending school in saudi arabia — were notably absent. Aoun says hariri will return to lebanon in time for its independence day holiday on wednesday, and it's unclear if hariri will go ahead with his resignation or take it back upon his return. Hariri told reporters in france that he will \" declare my political stance \" after meeting with aoun. He has not publicly discussed what happened during his time in saudi arabia. Hariri's resignation and lengthy absence started a political crisis in lebanon that goes beyond the organization of the government. There is speculation that saudi arabia forced him to resign as part of a power struggle with iran, which hariri denounced during his resignation, the bbc reports. There is fear of a looming war between iran and saudi arabia, which only increased saturday when saudi arabia asked its citizens to leave lebanon for the second time in two weeks.",

The creationist theme park in the works since 2010 has been denied $ 18 million in kentucky tax incentives based on concerns that it will violate the separation of church and state. Though the state initially gave its approval of the park in july, answers in genesis, the group in charge of the project, has since indicated it will hire employees based on religion, the courier-journal reports. Kentucky's tourism, arts and heritage cabinet also worries the park will advance the group's ministry activities, and \" state tourism tax incentives cannot be used to fund religious indoctrination or otherwise be used to advance religion, \" a tourism rep says. He adds officials will \" take no further action. \" but a lawyer for answers in genesis — which also runs the creation museum — says that amounts to \" unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination \" as the group is an \" overtly religious entity \" that is \" clearly allowed \" to consider religion when hiring. He says the group is considering legal action. Reuters reports employees may be asked to declare their belief in creationism. Gov. Steve beshear reiterated the state's concerns yesterday, but noted the park can still go ahead as planned. \" ark encounter has said publicly that the project will be built regardless of availability of state incentives, \" he said.
