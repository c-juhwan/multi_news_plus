        "summary": "Hindus revere cows as a symbol of life, including the liquid nourishment they provide — and not just the milk. Distilled urine from female cows has become a hot commodity in india, bloomberg reports, said to bring in at least as much cash as the other kind of cow juice. And it's created a booming business helped along by the efforts of prime minister narendra modi, who's funneled $ 87 million into protecting his country's bovines by beefing up cow shelters and prohibiting the eating of cow meat, among other measures. Holistic practitioners say the urine ( they call it the \" gomutra \" ) can bestow health benefits, and a research team last month said they had found gold in the urine of the country's gir cattle, lending even more mystique and reverence to the creatures, the indian express notes. A liter of cow urine can sell for up to $ 1.50, an employee of a company called patanjali ayurveda tells bloomberg, and it's even available on e-commerce sites like amazon. There are various ways you can prep the golden \" elixir, \" a coordinator at an indian cow research group says, noting more than two dozen home \" remedies \" can easily be whipped up. One of the most challenging parts of being a cow urine collector: knowing exactly when nature's call is about to strike. \" the attendants take clues from the animals ' movements and try to identify patterns in urination, \" a cow urine business owner tells bloomberg. Some of these local urin-preneurs are even trying to take on business giants like unilever and nestle sa with their consumer goods, and urine-based products are part of their portfolio. \" we prepare 20 tons … a day and still can't meet demand, \" the patanjali director says of his company's urine-based floor cleaner. A university of sydney epidemiologist, however, warns raw urine could harbor a number of diseases, and a farmer notes there may not be a cost benefit to keeping cows past their milking prime for the urine.

        "summary": "The role of the female orgasm has been a head-scratcher for centuries. Case-in-point: aristotle himself noted that the fact that human females don't need it to conceive clouded the quest for explanation. The statistics that show it's an \" uncommon \" occurrence during heterosexual intercourse and the lack of correlation between orgasm and number of offspring deepen the mystery — which scientists at yale and the cincinnati children's hospital may have \" solved, \" reports the guardian. Science reports there are about a dozen theories out there ( read a few here ); here's the upshot of this one, published in the journal of experimental zoology: the human female orgasm is rooted in an ancestral kind of ovulation present in some mammals ( cats, rabbits ) today, in which sex triggers a surge of hormones which then triggers the egg's release. Gunter wagner and mihaela pavlicev explain that with male-induced ovulation, the surge of oxytocin and prolactin triggers eggs to be released. Human females obviously don't ovulate that way: our spontaneous ovulation has no dependence on sexual activity. But the human female orgasm is still accompanied by that surge of oxytocin and prolactin, explains a press release. That suggests it's a remnant of that ancestral kind of ovulation, which the guardian reports was replaced with spontaneous ovulation in the ancestor of primates 75 million years ago. As science puts it, \" because those hormonal surges no longer confer a biological advantage, orgasms during intercourse may be lost in some women. \" wagner tells stat the female orgasm isn't going anywhere though, because one body of tissue becomes either the penis or clitoris in the human fetus. \" if the clitoris went away through evolution, so may the penis. \" ( sweden is trying to find out just how good sex is in sweden. )",

Geological historian jan zalasiewicz notes that some of his colleagues fear the planet could be headed for its next mass extinction in the next several centuries, thanks to humans'detrimental effects on the environment, livescience reports. If such an extinction occurs, zalasiewicz and his team say, rats may be the best-equipped to take over afterward. After all, even as we've tried to limit rat populations, they've remained hardy, with a presence on most of the earth's big landmasses and islands. They can handle all kinds of environments, suggesting their species could have the best odds of surviving a mass extinction. Historically, animals get bigger as they take over, so think 20-pounders or even much larger, says zalasiewicz in the daily mail. It wouldn't happen for three to 10 million years, he helpfully notes. Of course, \" it's a guess; it's a thought experiment, \" he says. \" but it is based on the way that geology has operated in the past and the types of creatures that have been successful. \" in an email to the guardian, zalasiewicz adds that \" cats, rabbits, \" and \" feral pigs \" are also candidates to outlast us.

Police in north yorkshire say the 67-year-old drove by a camera set up to catch speeders in december and flipped off authorities with his middle finger. Then he did the same thing twice more within a week, reports the bbc. The problem for hill is that police noticed more than the gesture in the photos — they spotted an illegal radar jammer and launched an investigation. At that point, police say hill first lied about the whereabouts of the range rover and then tried to destroy the jammer before admitting to using it. He pleaded guilty to \" perverting the course of justice \" and got an eight-month sentence, with the judge declaring that his actions \" strike at the heart of justice. \" a traffic constable had a different take in a police news release: \" if you want to attract our attention, repeatedly gesturing at police camera vans with your middle finger while you're driving a distinctive car fitted with a laser jammer is an excellent way to do it. \"",

In front of a global tv audience of millions, last year's winner, paulina vega, took the crown away from her fellow colombian and placed it on wurtzbach's head, reports the ap. Twitter users dubbed the mistake the \" fail of the decade \" and mercilessly mocked family feud host harvey, with one user tweeting: \" we asked one hundred americans what's the worst thing you could possibly do at a beauty pageant, \" usa today reports. After the pageant, wurtzbach said she wished arevalo well, the guardian reports, while former pageant co-owner donald trump gloated, retweeting the comment: \" donaldtrump must be overjoyed that as soon as he sells the pageant it goes off the rails. \" steve harvey tweeted apologies for his \" huge mistake, \" though nbc news reports that a now-deleted initial tweet did not go down well because he misspelled the names of both countries involved, apologizing to \" miss philippians and miss columbia. \" ( here's what else trump had to say after the mess. )",

        "summary": "The justice department is out to make sure that apple never again fixes the price of e-books — or anything else for that matter. It's asked a judge to ban apple \" from entering into agreements with suppliers of e-books, music, movies, television shows, or other content \" on itunes that could raise prices, according to pc mag. It also wants to require apple to allow competitors to sell books through ios apps, and it's demanding an external monitor to ensure apple abides by these rules. The plan spills out of apple's price-fixing conviction, and the wall street journal thinks it \" underscores the risks apple took when it gambled with a trial \" instead of settling. Apple also still faces a separate trial to determine what punitive damages it might have to pay. The company has said, however, that it intends to appeal the ruling.",

        "summary": "Who won thursday night: donald trump or fox news? the early word seems to be that there's \" no clear winner, \" as the baltimore sun puts it. Trump, of course, skipped the fox news gop debate, and other networks including cnn and msnbc ran portions of trump's alternate event, a fundraiser for veterans. Cnnmoney crunches a bunch of numbers: the debate got 12.5 million viewers, while cnn and msnbc got a combined total of about 2.7 million viewers. According to ratings experts, that means trump did likely take a \" chunk \" of viewers who otherwise would have watched fox. That 12.5 million number is half of the 25 million viewers who tuned in for the first debate of the season, which was attended by trump and was also on fox news. That's a comparison that seems \" disappointing, \" per cnnmoney. The other debates this cycle have gotten between 11 million and 25 million viewers, and cnnmoney thinks the best debate for comparison is the cnn dec. 15 debate, which drew 18 million viewers. So, again, a disappointing comparison for fox. Ultimately, we ' ll never know the true total for trump's event since it was covered so many places, nor will we know how many of those viewers would have watched fox instead had trump been at the debate. What we do know: trump won twitter, grabbing 36 % of the #gopdebate candidate mentions. In second place: ted cruz with 16 %. But he lost google, with \" debate live stream \" searches beating \" trump live stream \" searches by 170 %. And trump is still winning the drudge report's informal poll with 58.73 % of the vote as of this writing. \" those who might argue — or hope — that the trump fever will break because of the fight with fox might want to take notice of those, yes, unscientific results, \" writes jimmy lasalvia at salon. \" as a measure of fervor within a primary, it captures something real about the passion and the intensity of trump's support among the base. \"",

            "Move over nate silver. There's a new predictor in town, and his name is matt drudge. Silver, the statistician extraordinaire who has quite a reputation for using hard data to accurately predict the winners of political campaigns, declared last year that donald trump only had about a 5 percent chance of winning the republican presidential nomination. He could, of course, still end up being right. Silver, of course, is not the only one who thought that trump had virtually no chance of winning the gop race. Pollsters, strategists, and commentators from left to right have dismissed trump's chances of winning the nomination based on the conventional criteria for predicting it, such as polling, endorsements, political resume, and other traditional indicators of winning a party's nomination. One indicator that none of the experts have been looking to in their predictions or analysis is something that's relatively new. It's existed in previous campaigns, but it has distinguished itself significantly this year by being perhaps the most consistent indicator of how determined trump's supporters are to stick with him. It's the unscientific online poll of readers on the drudge report. Trump has dominated the drudge online poll that has been taken after every televised debate, and, naturally, he loves boasting about it."

Prosecutors have revealed that the women kept diaries documenting the extreme physical, mental, and sexual abuse they suffered at the hands of castro, who pleaded guilty to 937 counts in a deal that spares him the death penalty but gives him life in prison without parole — plus 1,000 years. Michelle knight, the first to be kidnapped, suffered \" the longest and most severely, \" according to a pre-sentencing report prepared by a psychiatrist. Knight is expected to give a victim statement; it's not clear whether amanda berry and gina dejesus will also testify. ( in a recent thank-you note to police, knight wrote that \" life is tough, but i ' m tougher! \" ) prosecutors say the report and today's testimony will serve as a record in case castro's sentence is ever reviewed, reports the cleveland plain dealer. Castro's sister says he will deliver a lengthy statement to the court that will let people see \" the other side of ariel castro \" and show he is \" not the monster that everyone thinks he is. \"",

Whitman, former ceo of ebay and current chief of hewlett-packard, met with some board members individually in recent weeks, but her candidacy never got as far as a vote because she withdrew from consideration, apparently put off by the amount of infighting within the board, the new york times reports. \" we have a lot of work still to do at hpe and i am not going anywhere, \" she tweeted thursday. \" uber's ceo will not be meg whitman. \" according to the times'sources, the board faction hoping to install whitman or somebody similar as ceo includes venture capitalist matt cohler and uber co-founder garrett camp, among others. Kalanick is \" plotting a comeback, \" the sources say, and the alliances of other board members, particularly arianna huffington, are unclear. Kalanick stepped down under shareholder pressure more than a month ago. Sources tell recode that after returning from sailing in tahiti, he has been meddling in the company's day-to-day affairs. The sources say he has told multiple people, including at least one ceo candidate, that he is \" steve jobs-ing it, \" planning a return similar to that of the apple founder.",

Things didn't work out so well for samsung the first time around; in this round, apple is seeking $ 2 billion in damages — double its first payout — over accusations samsung infringed on five of its patents on newer devices. It wants $ 40 for each device sold with features like \" slide-to-unlock, \" universal search, and the ability to tap a number inside a text message to dial it. On the flip side, samsung is accusing apple of infringing on two of its patents. But the tech giant drawing a heavy portion of the case's attention is actually google, the new york times reports. To wit, the wall street journal reports \" the docket might as well read apple inc. V. Google inc. \" that's because four of the features in the crosshairs are part of the android os, reports the journal, which points out that \" the stakes are higher \" than they were in 2012, because the targeted patents relate to the iphone 5 and galaxy s3, which saw heavy sales. The guardian notes that apple can't attack google directly because infringement only arises when the android code is put into hardware, but google engineers will likely take the stand in an effort to help samsung defend itself. A boston university law lecturer seems to think google is fairly safe, noting that by the time the trial ( pegged at lasting about a month ) and appeals wrap up, newer devices will already have flooded the market. \" to kill android with a half-dozen patents just seems like a long shot. \"",

The trial will mark the latest round in a long-running series of lawsuits between the two tech giants that underscore a much larger concern about what is allowed to be patented. Like the previous trial, held in summer 2012, the new one will be overseen by judge lucy koh in the california district court in san jose. Samsung is appealing against that verdict, where a jury found in apple's favour on every count, though reducing its damages claim. In the new trial apple is seeking damages of $ 2bn, claiming infringement of five patents by samsung devices sold in the us between 2010 and 2012, including galaxy smartphones and tablets. Samsung is claiming infringement of two of its patents by the iphone and ipad. Jury selection begins on monday relating to data transmission and the use of video, audio and photos. \" there's a widespread suspicion that lots of the kinds of software patents at issue are written in ways that cover more ground than what apple or any other tech firm actually invented, \" notre dame law professor mark mckenna said. \" overly broad patents allow companies to block competition. \" if apple is successful, it could bring similar lawsuits against other android handset makers, because the patents at issue are part of google's android software, rather than being particular to samsung's touchwiz software. Apple cannot sue google directly because it is only when the android code is implemented in hardware that infringement arises. However the slow pace of lawsuits has raised the question of how effective such lawsuits are. Apple began the lawsuits when steve jobs expressed frustration at what he saw as \" copying \" by android of iphone features, and vowed to go \" thermonuclear \" in his attempts to stamp them out.

In the new trial apple is seeking damages of $ 2bn, claiming infringement of five patents by samsung devices sold in the us between 2010 and 2012, including galaxy smartphones and tablets. Samsung is claiming infringement of two of its patents by the iphone and ipad. Jury selection begins on monday relating to data transmission and the use of video, audio and photos. \" there's a widespread suspicion that lots of the kinds of software patents at issue are written in ways that cover more ground than what apple or any other tech firm actually invented, \" notre dame law professor mark mckenna said. \" overly broad patents allow companies to block competition. \" if apple is successful, it could bring similar lawsuits against other android handset makers, because the patents at issue are part of google's android software, rather than being particular to samsung's touchwiz software. Apple cannot sue google directly because it is only when the android code is implemented in hardware that infringement arises. However the slow pace of lawsuits has raised the question of how effective such lawsuits are. Apple began the lawsuits when steve jobs expressed frustration at what he saw as \" copying \" by android of iphone features, and vowed to go \" thermonuclear \" in his attempts to stamp them out. But apple has had very few concrete successes in courts, despite a number of successful cases, with google's software now powering about a billion devices worldwide. Apple filed the suit against the south"

        "summary": "Ariel castro wasn't on suicide watch when he hanged himself on tuesday, but he had been previously. Much of the media — as well as ohio's prison system — is still asking why and how, with much of the focus zeroing in on why he wasn't on suicide watch. Castro lawyer craig weintraub yesterday said his request for a psychological evaluation of castro was denied just two weeks before the suicide, and he tells cleveland.com why he made the request — because castro had previously been on suicide prevention at cuyahoga county jail. The ap reports that lasted until early june, and was apparently spurred by a 2004 letter that mentioned suicide. The daily beast notes that castro's watch ended after officials assessing his situation found he wasn't displaying enough risk factors, and explains prison officials may have had good reason to keep him off it. It spoke with an expert on suicide prevention in prisons, who says that castro's risk factors ( among them, the fact that he was never getting out of jail ) were never going to change; perpetual suicide watch isn't the answer. Meanwhile, ohio's prison system is making an attempt to get to the bottom of it: the state's prison director yesterday ordered a customary review of the suicide, but also ordered a second review into castro and his care. As for what castro's victims think about his death, cnn reports they plan to keep silent.",

It's clear that john boehner has shifted strategy and now wants to negotiate one big deal to solve both problems at once — before the oct. 17 default deadline, report the los angeles times and the wall street journal. In other words, republicans have put aside their single-minded focus to defund obamacare and now want to forge a deal — a \" grand bargain, \" to use a familiar dc phrase — to reduce the size of government. \" obamacare's just part of it, \" says gop rep. Charles boustany. \" we're going to try to get what we can, but we understand that's the president's legacy. The bigger problem facing the country, in my mind, is the debt, and the fact that we have entitlement programs that are still growing without end in sight. And we need tax reform. \" the big hitch, of course, is that republicans want to negotiate all this before the debt ceiling deadline, while the white house and democrats insist that they ' ll negotiate only after republicans raise the ceiling without conditions. ( reports surfaced yesterday that boehner wants to avoid a default at all costs, even if it means striking a deal with democrats. ) so what next? house republicans meet today, though \" honestly, i don't know what we're going to do, \" rep.

The group says the bears are believed to have been the last two dancing bears in nepal, which officially banned the practice 40 years ago. Police confiscated the bears after the owners were tracked down in a remote village. The animals are now at a national park in nepal and will be given a permanent home at a wildlife sanctuary next year. The rescued sloth bears, 15 and 17 years old, showed signs of trauma including cowering and paw-sucking, wildlife officials say. Mary hutton, founder of the free the bears group, tells the australian broadcasting corporation that dancing bears are generally kept in \" appalling \" conditions, often by owners who can't afford to feed them more than a few pieces of bread a day. The group says it has helped end the practice in several other countries, including india, where more than 600 bears were freed during a 15-year campaign. Wildlife protection groups say a major part of the effort is finding new employment for the owners of dancing bears, which is why two of the owners in nepal were given temporary jobs helping to look after the animals instead of being charged or fined.",

After three years of scouring official documents and grand jury files, british author piu eatwell puts forth a new theory that aspiring actress elizabeth short was killed in 1947 by a man with links to organized crime who threatened to expose other los angeles murders if police arrested him, reports opposing views. According to eatwell's black dahlia, red rose, short had a falling out with danish businessman and nightclub owner mark hansen, who then used his mob connections to ask accused pimp leslie dillon to get rid of her, reports the sun. Hansen, one of several suspects in short's murder, may not have realized that dillon was a sadistic psychopath who would use his experience as a mortician's assistant to torture and kill short before cutting her body in two and draining it of blood, eatwell writes. She believes the murder took place at the aster motel, whose owner hid a blood-stained room and a bundle of bloodied clothes found on the same day as short's body for fear he'd become a suspect. Eatwell says police later questioned dillon, who knew details of the murder even police did not, per people. But he was never arrested because he threatened to embarrass police by exposing the extent of organized crime in la, says eatwell, adding she's \" confident \" she's solved the case.

He soon learned that base jumping from a 13,000-foot mountain peak, gliding and hitting a target little bigger than a body is the opposite of easy. After two months of training, however, that's exactly what reffet and fellow wingsuit jumper fred fugen pulled off over the bernese alps in western switzerland. A video by sponsor red bull shows the french duo known as the soul flyers leaping from jungfrau mountain and hitting speeds of 85mph, before hurtling through the open door of a pilatus porter aircraft flying at roughly 10,000 feet. The feat — inspired by french base jumper patrick de gayardon, who jumped and returned to a plane while wearing a wingsuit in 1997, per red bull — has been viewed more than 1.7 million times in two days. Yet the two-minute video doesn't give any indication of the amount of practice the accomplishment required. \" when we started to train, we thought it would be easier to be honest, \" reffet tells red bull. \" then we realized that it was quite a technical and mental challenge. We had to be focused … it takes all your energy. \" the pair actually made 100 attempts, at least 20 of which were successful, before the main event, in which they used \" a push-to-talk system \" to communicate with each other and the plane's pilot, philippe bouvier, reports the telegraph. Together, they \" redefined the idea of catching a flight, \" per cbs news. \" you're falling down and all of a sudden there's no air anymore. The feeling is quite strange, \" says reffet. \" when you're in the plane and you see your friend flying closer and closer, it's incredible. \" ( a legendary base jumper recently died. )",

In a survey of 870 adults between the ages of 18 and 82, a whopping 88 % of respondents reported that they've engaged in sexting — for purposes of the study defined as sending or receiving sexually explicit material via text — while 82 % said they had sexted in the past year. Nearly 75 % of people reported sexting within the bounds of a committed relationship, and npr reports there were similar levels of sexting between men and women. The research was released at the american psychological association's annual convention this week. \" given the possible implications, both positive and negative, for sexual health, it is important to continue investigating the role sexting plays in current romantic and sexual relationships, \" says a co-author, per a press release. For example, the study shows greater levels of sexting corresponded with greater overall sexual satisfaction and greater relationship satisfaction for couples. While researchers aren't sure whether more sexting results in better sex lives or better sex lives result in more sexting, they are hopeful sexting — with further research — could become a part of helping couples in therapy, npr notes.

It was there that the would-be artist found himself staring quite heartbroken at the big-eyed homeless children fighting over scraps of food in the street. Keane would later write: \"as if goaded by a kind of frantic despair, i sketched these dirty, ragged little victims of the war with their bruised, lacerated minds and bodies, their matted hair and runny noses. Here my life as a painter began in earnest \". By the early 1960s, the artist's prints and postcards were selling in the many millions; with the great and the good, including natalie wood, joan crawford, dean martin, jerry lewis and kim novak buying up",
            "There's a sweet, small suburban house in the vineyards of napa, northern california. Inside, a family of devout jehovah's witnesses bustles around, offering me a cheese plate. A siamese cat weaves in and out of my legs. Everything is lovely. Sitting unobtrusively in the corner is 87-year-old margaret keane. \"would you like some macadamia nuts? \" she asks. She hands me jehovah's witness pamphlets too. \"jehovah looks after me every day, \" she says. \"i really feel it. \" she is the last person you'd expect to be a participant in one of the great art frauds of the 20th century. This story begins in berlin in 1946. A young american named walter keane was in europe to learn how to be a painter. And there he was, staring heartbroken at the big-eyed children fighting over scraps of food in the rubbish. As he would later write:",
            "In san francisco in the 1950s, margaret was a woman trying to make it on her own after leaving her husband with only her daughter and her paintings. She meets gregarious ladies ' man and fellow painter walter keane in a park while she was struggling to make an impact with her drawings of children with big eyes. The two quickly become a pair with outgoing walter selling their paintings and quiet margaret holed up at home painting even more children with big eyes. But walter's actually selling her paintings as his own. A clash of financial success and critical failure soon sends margaret reeling in her life of lies. With walter still living the high life, margaret's going to have to try making it on her own again and re-claiming her name and her paintings. Written by anne campbell"

Ahead of the hearing, the obama administration declassified and released documents outlining the rules for accessing information from the surveillance program and listing multiple violations of those rules, reports the wall street journal. Key parts of the files including terms used to search phone data were blacked out, the bbc notes. Sen. Patrick leahy, the committee's chairman, accused the administration of exaggerating the program's success. \" if this program is not effective, it has to end. So far, i ' m not convinced by what i've seen, \" he said, noting that information provided to congress didn't back up the administration's claim that the program foiled 54 terrorist plots, the washington post reports. Under questioning from leahy, deputy nsa director john inglis admitted that the phone-snooping had \" made a contribution \" in foiling 12 domestic plots, but had been the critical factor in just one. As the hearing was in progress, edward snowden released information on another far-reaching nsa surveillance program.",

The clause, which calls for all 28 states to offer \" aid and assistance by all means in their power \" after \" armed aggression \" on a member's territory, has never been used before, the bbc reports. Hollande is seeking to amend france's laws and constitution to make anti-terror operations easier to conduct, the new york times reports.

He also plans to extend the current state of emergency for three months and make it possible to strip dual nationals convicted of terror offenses of their french passports. Authorities in france and belgium are still hunting salah abdeslam, a belgian national believed to have helped the paris attackers. Abdelhamid abaaoud, another belgian national, is suspected of masterminding the attack.

Police in serbia have arrested a man carrying a passport with the same details, and they believe both passports are fake. The attacker is believed to have entered greece last month posing as a refugee, and more than 20 states now say they will refuse syrian refugees because they fear there could be terrorists among them.

        "summary": "During hibernation, animals like bears and mice lose as much as 30 % of their synapses as the creatures cool; but those brain connections are recreated when they wake back up however many weeks or months later. Synapses are similarly lost ( but, of course, not reformed ) in the brains of alzheimer's patients, and that loss correlates with memory loss. Now a team out of the uk is reporting in the journal nature on the role a \" cold-shock \" protein called rbm3 may play. The team found then when both young and old mice ( in this case, a non-hibernating version ) with alzheimer's disease were chilled and then warmed up, only the young ones were able to reform their connections. And in those young mice, rbm3 levels jumped as they cooled; the same wasn't true for their elderly counterparts, reports the bbc. But by boosting rbm3 levels, the team found they could prevent \" synapse and brain cell depletion. \" \" this gives us a target to develop a drug in the same way paracetamol is used for a fever rather than a cold bath, \" one of the lead researchers says. And though it's too early to say whether such an effect will be similar in humans, the lab behind this discovery — the medical research council's toxicology unit in leicester — is the one that first prevented the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease. \" while we don't think body cooling is a feasible treatment for long-term, progressive conditions like alzheimer's disease, this research opens up the possibility of finding drugs that can have the same effect, \" an outside researcher says.

Both labyrinth of lies by giulio ricciarelli and the people vs. Fritz bauer by lars kraume portray the state prosecutor from stuttgart as a controversial figure in the post-war years — he was jewish, atheist, and gay, and he wanted those who worked in death camps brought to justice at a time when many germans wanted to forget or ignore the horrors of the nazi regime, reports afp. And though his 1968 death looked like suicide, it remains a topic of debate to this day. \" my guess is that until now the germans did not want to honor a person who pointed so openly to their incompetence in dealing with their nazi past, \" says the author of a bauer book. Bauer tipped off israel that adolf eichmann was hiding in argentina; the mossad swooped in and kidnapped him in 1960 and he was executed in israel in 1962. A year later he brought the nazis who ran auschwitz to court for the first time in germany, fueled in part by the nine months he spent in a concentration camp in 1933 just a few years after becoming germany's youngest judge at 27, reports the independent. He received hate mail and death threats and is said to have once told a colleague: \" as soon as i leave the confines of my office, i am on enemy territory. \" the independent calls it a \" belated triumph \" that half a century later reunited germany is trying to track down the remaining holocaust perpetrators, using bauer's own logic that working in death camps equates complicity in murder.

What you need to know: bad timing? the senator is the first in what's expected to be a crowded field, but although time is on his side, history isn't: a bloomberg analysis of records going back to 1952 found that no first announcer ever won the presidency, and only two — democrats adlai stevenson and george mcgovern — secured their party's nomination. Or not: at npr, ron elving sees five \" good reasons \" for cruz to have made the early move. Per elving, cruz faces some formidable challenges ( the need for cash, an \" expanding gop field \" ) that he can now start to tackle. Further, \" real men needn't horse around with exploratory committees, \" right? cruz's move frames him as the \" straight-shooter \" he wants to come across as. And'the sooner cruz gets in, the longer his long-shot candidacy will last, \" writes elving, who suggests cruz could rack up some media exposure, exit the field, then angle to get the no. 2 spot on the ticket. The logistics of it: politico explains cruz is taking advantage of a bit of a window: a two-week senate recess begins next week and runs through april 10, offering \" an incentive for candidates in federal office to formally announce. \" who will follow? potentially no one this month. Politico expects rand paul to announce april 7 and marco rubio to also announce in april. What cruz is in for: at hotair, jazz shaw predicts the media will \" open up with both barrels and hit cruz with everything they've got. \" shaw is beginning to think cruz may just be able to withstand that, and if he does, \" the wavering donors who aren't feeling all that comfortable about jeb, christie, or walker may see a new place to invest. \"",

The unha-3 is an expandable carrier rocket that was launched in 2012 and fell into the yellow sea. The debris of a second stage launch fell into the philippine sea after an object had entered orbit. Another seoul government source said intelligence indicated north korea was producing long-distance rockets in a pyongyang munitions factory and that south korea had credible information kim jong un had ordered the launch of a \" satellite \" to mark the 70th anniversary of the workers ' party of north korea. Activities at pyongyang mirim airport showed preparations for a large-scale military inspection by kim jong un.

Their position: that jordan graham blindfolded cody johnson before shoving him. They shared that theory with the defense in an oct. 25 conference call, and are reportedly awaiting a dna test on a piece of cloth found near johnson's body, reports mtn news. But the defense isn't having it, for more reasons than one, which they outlined in court filing on friday. First, there's the practicality of it, says attorney michael donahoe: if the two were \" arguing intensely on the ledge it hardly seems plausible that the argument would cease abruptly so jordan could apply a blindfold. \" second, there's the timing: donahoe says the cloth was sent out for testing more than three weeks before his call with prosecutors; based on that timing, he says there's a good chance \" the blindfold theory was not put to the grand jury at all \"; the indictment was filed on oct. 3, notes cnn. He wants the judge to bar the new theory from being presented, and, further, he wants the murder charge dropped, alleging a mishandled fbi interrogation of graham. He notes in his filing that an fbi interrogator sent a detective out of the room so he could \" shape \" graham's initial 90-minute interview without recording it, though doing so is required in montana and though the equipment to do so was available, reports the ap.

Cbs news reports saucier, a former navy sailor, served a year in prison after pleading guilty in 2016 to taking pictures of the reactor inside the uss alexandria nuclear submarine seven years earlier. Saucier's lawyers admitted he knew the area was classified but say he wanted to show his family his job. Prosecutors said saucier was disgruntled and risked national security, not to mention obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera. Saucier's lawyers argued he shouldn't go to prison because the fbi didn't charge clinton for mishandling classified information, according to bloomberg. That argument got the case a lot of attention on fox news and, therefore, a lot of attention from president trump. Saucier's lawyer, ronald daigle, says fox news coverage was \" absolutely \" key in getting trump to care about the case, huffpost reports. During the presidential campaign, trump said saucier's \" life was ruined \" despite doing \" nothing \" compared to what clinton did. \"it's an old submarine, believe me, they have pictures of that submarine that nobody knows about, probably, right? \" trump said days before the election. Saucier, having completed his sentence, appeared on fox &amp; friends last week. On friday, the white house announced trump had pardoned him. \" congratulations to kristian saucier, a man who has served proudly in the navy, on your newly found freedom, \" trump tweeted. \" now you can go out and have the life you deserve! \"",

Judging by 180 straight, undergraduate couples in a university of wisconsin-madison study, those who list themselves as \" in a relationship \" and share couple photographs are more likely to be together after six months, bloomberg reports. Researchers call their study \" the couple who facebooks together, stays together \" and liken online declarations to other commitments made it public: \" the claims people make about themselves in public are likely to be very influential in how they think about themselves, \" study co-author catalina toma tells phys.org. \" now we're finding that these public self-presentations performed on facebook also affect how people feel about a relationship partner. \" in other words, she says, commitments made before lots of people on facebook may be like wedding vows made before family and friends. But people who post often on a partner's wall have less chance of making the six-month cut, perhaps because oversharing feels like possessiveness, says toma. She adds that more shared friends also hurt relationship commitment, possibly giving partners more romantic options. Now, would studying older people over a longer period of time bring different results? laura beck ( a self-described \" old \" ) writes at cosmopolitan that in her experience, people who post \" how much they looooooooove their significant others are often hanging on by a thread in their irl relationship — they doth protest too much, ya know? \" ( see what \" insecure people \" post on facebook. )",

        "summary": "Now that elizabeth warren has taken an ancestry test that shows \" strong evidence \" of native american ancestry, she wants president trump to pay up on a challenge. In a tweet, warren reminded trump that he once publicly challenged her to take such a dna test for $ 1 million. \" please send the check to the national indigenous women's resource center, \" wrote warren, explaining in another tweet that the nonprofit group protects native american women from violence. Trump has long ridiculed warren as \" pocahontas \" over her claims of native american ancestry. In july, he joked that he would toss a dna test on stage if he ever debated her, per the hill: \" and we will say, ' i will give you a million dollars, paid for by trump, to your favorite charity if you take the test and it shows you're an indian, \" trump said. \" and we ' ll see what she does. I have a feeling she will say no. \" monday morning, however, the president denied to reporters he ever issued such a challenge: \" who cares? i didn't say that.... You better read it again. \" the dna test doesn't definitively prove that warren is native american. It says her ancestry is mostly european, but strongly suggests she has a native american ancestor going back six to 10 generations — putting her in a range of being 1/64th to 1/1,024th native american.

Mtn news reports that a search is underway, but the recovery process is \" very difficult because of the hazards of the environment, \" a park spokesperson says. The great falls tribune reports that some hot springs in the park can reach 200 degrees fahrenheit — enough to be instantly fatal. The mishap comes on the heels of several other incidents at yellowstone recently. Over the weekend, a 13-year-old boy slipped out of his father's arms and fell into a hot pool at the upper geyser basin and had to be flown to a nearby hospital to be treated for burns, reports the billings gazette; his father also suffered burns in rescuing the boy. And in may, a bison calf had to be euthanized after tourists who were concerned it was cold loaded it into their suv, a film crew was cited for leaving the boardwalk and going onto the grand prismatic spring, and a woman was charged by a cow elk when she got too close. The park service asks visitors to remain at least 25 yards from all wildlife, and four times that from bears and wolves. ( one park rep says people get over-zealous especially in selfie quests. )",

Sean \" stanley \" leary of california, a base jumper, climber, and stuntman, has been confirmed as one of two jumpers who died in the park earlier this month, reports the los angeles times. A friend says he appears to have been killed instantly when he clipped a notch in the mountain during a solo, moonlit jump on march 13. The 38-year-old, famous for exploring new routes up mountains in venezuela and antarctica, is being mourned by the climbing community, which describes him as friendly and humble despite his amazing exploits. Among them: more than 50 climbs of yosemite's el capitan, where he scaled a 2,900-foot wall in a record-setting 2.5 hours. It was at el capitan that the nickname stanley was born; leary had packed a typical stanley-brand claw hammer for the climb, rather than one made just for climbing. Leary's wife is seven months pregnant, and friends say his death is doubly tragic because he took up the sport that ended up killing him in the wake of the 2006 death of his girlfriend, a brazilian climber who died in a utah car crash. \" right before she died she made him promise her that he would keep pursuing adventure, \" friend and film producer nick rosen tells the san francisco chronicle. \" he was really, really low and base jumping became this affirmation of life for him. It's really tragic because, in a very real way, he had since risen from the ashes and had found love again and was looking forward to family life. \" ( another renowned base jumper was killed during an august jump. )",

However, the move came mere hours after a us senate report accused backpage of being \" far more complicit in online sex trafficking than anyone previously knew. \" the review of some 1.1 million pages of company documents concluded backpage removed terms like \" teenage, \" \" rape, \" and \" young \" from ads indicating sex trafficking or prostitution but left the ads in place. \" having to get rid of the ad altogether was bad for business, \" one moderator said, according to the report; 99 % of the site's income reportedly came from its \" adult \" section. \" backpage's response wasn't to deny what we said. It was to shut down their site, \" sens. Rob portman and claire mccaskill say, per reuters. \" that's not ' censorship ' — it's validation of our findings. \" backpage's ceo and two founders were cleared of pimping charges in december but still face new charges of money laundering and conspiracy to commit pimping, reports the post.

Pro-russian troops who have seized the ukrainian base fired warning shots when they were approached by hundreds of ukrainian soldiers demanding their jobs back. They said they would shoot the ukrainians if they got any closer. In other developments: with john kerry on his way to kiev, vladimir putin has ordered tens of thousands of russian troops on exercises near the border to return to their bases, easing fears that russia plans to invade the eastern part of ukraine after tightening its grip on crimea, reuters reports. Russia's united nations envoy claims troops were sent across the border to protect civilians at the request of ousted ukrainian leader viktor yanukovich, reports the bbc. Western diplomats say russia's arguments in favor of intervention are groundless, though the la times notes that cia director john brennan told officials yesterday that a 1997 treaty allows up to 25,000 russian troops in the crimea region, meaning moscow may not consider the troop movement an invasion. Some 16,000 russian troops are now believed to be in the region. The obama administration has suspended military ties with russia and us officials say the next move will be to freeze the assets of top russian officials. European leaders, however, are resisting calls for tough economic sanctions if the russians don't withdraw. \" the biggest argument for severe economic sanctions not being imposed is that the european countries don't have much of an alternative to russian energy supplies, \" an analyst tells the new york times.",

The white house says the presidential advisory commission on election integrity — set up last year to investigate trump's claims that millions of people illegally voted for hillary clinton in 2016 — is being disbanded because many states defied its requests for voter data, reports cnn. \" rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today i signed an executive order to dissolve the commission, \" trump said in a statement wednesday.

It took place about 4am saturday when police answered a disturbance call from a man who said his teenage son, home from college, was trying to break into his bedroom with a baseball bat. Some details: the start: antonio legrier called 911 to report that his son, quintonio, was threatening him. The elder legrier also called his downstairs neighbor, a 55-year-old mother of five identified as bettie jones, to warn her that his son was a \" little irate \" and not to open her door \" unless police arrive, \" reports the chicago sun-times. The shooting: police say they arrived and opened fire after being confronted by a \" combative \" quintonio legrier.
