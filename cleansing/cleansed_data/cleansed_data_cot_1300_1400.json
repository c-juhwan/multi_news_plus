But regardless of what the senate report says, the interrogation program saved lives, its former head writes in the post. \" unlike the committee's staff, i don't have to examine the program through a rearview mirror.

The senate intelligence committee members, meanwhile, \" started with a conclusion in 2009 and have chased supportive evidence ever since. \" senators \" never spoke to me or other top cia leaders involved in the program, or let us see the report, \" rodriguez writes, calling on the public to remember the \" context \" of the program following the 9/11 attacks and numerous other threats. What's more, he notes, the program was effective — and \" intelligence work is like doing a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle without the picture on the box top and with millions of extra pieces. \" finally, the program was \" approved at the highest levels of the government. \" ahead of the report's release, \" authorities must ensure that we don't make the job of my successors, who are trying to prevent future terrorist attacks, any harder. \" click for the full piece.",

Per a release, that concept is \" zero, \" an abstract mathematical construct that scientists say stumps humans until at least preschool, but which they now note is apparently grasped by these small-brained insects. Australian and french researchers published their findings in the journal science, noting that their flying subjects were able to prioritize numerical quantities using a reward system, and that the results could have implications for artificial intelligence down the road. Per livescience, the scientists used a rotating set of two cards with symbols on them, with one card having a higher number of symbols than the other. The bees were given a sugar solution if they picked the card with the lower number. Not only did the bees fly more often to the cards with the least number of symbols on them, they also, when presented with a card that had nothing on it and a card with symbols, flew more often to the blank card. Interestingly, they also flew more often to the zero card when the opposing card had a higher number of symbols — meaning it seemed easier for them to know zero's low place in the hierarchy if the opposing number was a high one. Scientists are mostly amazed because a human brain boasts 86 million neurons; a bee brain gets by with one million. \" large brains are thus not necessary to play with numbers, \" study co-author aurore avargues-weber says in the release. Not much brain power being needed to get \" nothing \" also suggests \" there are simple, efficient ways to teach ai new tricks, \" study co-author adrian dyer adds.

Paramedics had to cut off pieces of the board to fit darius into the ambulance, and a larger police helicopter had to be used to transport him to johns hopkins. After the board was fully removed, it took doctors about two hours to remove the screw from darius'skull and brain. Cohen says they couldn't just unscrew it or \" there could be torrential hemorrhaging. \" instead, the team drilled holes on either side of the screw to get it out and replaced the missing portions of darius'skull with a titanium plate. All told, the screw — which cohen called \" a ticking time bomb — was lodged in darius'skull for about seven hours, his mom, joy ellingsworth, tells cnn.

The upshot from the study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences is that some creatures might have developed legs, or something very much like them, while still living in the water, reports livescience. \"it's what we've all been waiting for, \" says a cambridge paleontologist not involved with the study. \" until this discovery, we weren't able to see the changes by which the pelvic fins of the fish became much larger and more robust, and gradually turned into the tetrapod hind limb. \"",

Mock recruitment video \" welcome to isil-land \" is 69 seconds of graphic violence meant to undermine the abundance of isis online propaganda. The message: isis casually kills innocent muslims and they ' ll kill you, too. Using footage shot by the group — including mosques blown up by suicide bombers, crucified bodies, severed heads, whippings, and executions, as per the new york daily news — the video is aimed at young and disaffected western muslims, who are \" potential recruits, potential sympathizers, \" says a department spokeswoman. Some 100 americans have already joined isis, adds cnn. So far, the video hasn't proven popular, with only 42,000 views since july — far less than the execution of journalist james foley. But isis is a formidable online adversary, proving itself \" successful and effective … at using propaganda, particularly social media, \" one terrorism expert tells the post. And then there's this problem — potential isis recruits are \" enthused by videos of executions and suicide bombings, not deterred by them, \" says one expert. The youtube video is part of a wider campaign to battle isis on those platforms, the us posting opposing messages on facebook, twitter, and tumblr in various languages. The department acknowledges the latest video's flaws: \" we poke holes in their narrative, try to turn the tables. You're not going to get a knockout blow, \" says an official.",

The team was uniquely poised to study the question in sweden, where every citizen has a unique identification number that helps track every visit to a physician, every prescription, and even dog ownership registration, which became mandatory in 2001. ( once the data is de-identified, it's free for researchers to use in, say, large longitudinal studies. ) in this massive study, researchers followed all 11 million children born in sweden from 2001 through 2010. Previous research has been conflicting, but as many other studies have already suggested, this one finds that early exposure to dogs, at least in sweden, results in a 13 % lower risk of asthma in later childhood. The link was dramatically stronger in farm animals — where exposure in early childhood resulted in a 50 % lower risk of asthma later. Still, that doesn't mean that kids who have an animal allergy should be further exposed; in fact, that can exacerbate the allergy, the researchers say. \" there have been a few studies that have alluded to this but not such a longitudinal study with so many children, so from that point of view this is quite a powerful study, \" a rep from allergy uk tells the bbc. \" it's very welcome. \" ( canines might have a probiotic effect on us. )",

While one's own personality obviously plays a major role — high earners tend to be extroverted, self-confident, and ambitious — one's spouse's personality also factors in significantly, especially if that spouse is conscientious, reports scientific american. Subjects with more conscientious spouses tended to be more satisfied with their job, to earn more, and to be promoted more often — possibly, researchers hypothesize, because conscientious spouses do more housework and errands, so their spouses can put more of their effort toward work. The researchers looked at 4,544 married heterosexual people, 75 % of whom came from dual-income households, to measure extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. They also tracked wages, promotions, and job satisfaction over a 5-year period, and surveyed the participants about lifestyle decisions and marital satisfaction. Sure enough, the conscientious spouse tended to have the most impact when it comes to helping a person's career, and it's true regardless of whether that spouse also works. Upi reports that one researcher says: \" a spouse's personality influences many daily factors that sum up and accumulate across time to afford one the many actions necessary to receive a promotion or a raise. \" ( other research: marriage is a super friendship. )",

        "summary": "Families looking to bring the magic of harry potter into their homes are causing major problems among wild owls in asia. A paper chronicling this phenomenon as the \"harry potter effect \" traces the rise in the illegal owl trade since the boy wizard's film debut, reports the guardian. Though direct correlation has not been established, strong circumstantial evidence suggests that the surge in demand for pet owls is attributable to the creatures ' prominence in the fictional wizarding world. Since the first potter movie was released in 2001, the rise of owls seen in indonesia's bird markets rose from a few hundred to more than 13,000 in 2016. ( pet ' hedwigs ' run about $ 10 to $ 30, making owls sold there affordable to middle-class shoppers. ) \"i visited jatinegara market in jakarta last week and within 30 minutes i had recorded 108 scops owls and 27 barn owls, \" vincent nijman, one of the paper's authors, notes. Other parts of asia, including india and thailand, are also seeing a boom in illegally captured owls, reports business insider. But owls, especially those taken from the wild, undergo stress and premature death when they are kept as pets. \" they are alive and cute when you see them on the market, but realistically they are already dead, \" nijman tells nature. Author jk rowling has spoken out in the past about keeping owls as pets after a surge in abandoned owls was reported following the release of the first potter film: \"if anybody has been influenced by my books to think an owl would be happiest shut in a small cage and kept in a house, i would like to take this opportunity to say as forcefully as i can, you are wrong. \"",

        "summary": "Two decades after putting earth in its rear-view mirror, the cassini spacecraft is preparing to wrap up its mission to saturn — and that means plunging to its death in the planet's atmosphere, according to a press release. Cassini has been orbiting saturn since 2004, sending back information on the planet and its moons. But now it's running low on fuel, and that means it's time to prepare for the end. On april 26, cassini will start the first of 22 dives into the gap between saturn and its rings. No spacecraft has ever traversed that gap. \" what we learn from cassini's daring final orbits will further our understanding of how giant planets, and planetary systems everywhere, form and evolve, \" one nasa administrator says. With those dives complete, cassini will begin its plunge into saturn itself on sept. 15, disintegrating on approach. The mission's project manager tells the guardian that cassini essentially signed its own death warrant when it discovered environments potentially habitable to life on saturn's moons. Nasa doesn't want to risk contaminating those environments by having cassini inadvertently crash into them. However, sending the spacecraft to its doom is far from a waste. A nasa project scientist says \" some of its most extraordinary observations \" will come during its final plunge. That includes collecting data that could hint at saturn's internal structure and the origins of its rings and the first-ever sample of saturn's atmosphere. Space.com has a video showing what the final weeks of cassini's mission will look like.",

Picard, who had a pistol on his hip, says barone then took his gun, permit, and — after knocking it out of his hand first — his camera, reports the washington post. Unbeknownst to barone, the camera was still rolling. \" you want me to punch a number on this either way? we gotta cover our ass, \" barone is heard asking troopers patrick torneo and john jacobi after picard's permit comes back valid, per courthouse news. They then discuss charging picard with reckless use of the highway and creating a public disturbance. \" and then we claim that in backup, we had multiple people, they didn't want to stay and give us a statement, \" torneo says, per the suit. The charges were eventually dropped, but picard says his rights were violated. The interaction was \" unbelievable \" and \" shows that police and prosecutors in connecticut should not be in charge of policing themselves, \" says an aclu rep. The connecticut state police unions say the lawsuit is \" frivolous and will ultimately be dismissed. \"",

The hairy animals with long noses and an appetite for insects do sport \" pocketknives \" for front claws, afp reports, which they typically put to use digging into anthills. In two separate incidents in brazil, however, the 4- to 7-foot-long animals have dug into people instead, and the hunters who encountered them bled to death after being punctured in their thighs and upper arms; one man was hit in the femoral arteries. Both cases, one in 2010 and one in 2012, have just been described in scientific literature this month. \" these injuries are very serious and we have no way of knowing whether it is a defense behavior acquired by the animals, \" one researcher says, adding that it's important to give the anteaters space. One estimate has their population down by about 30 % in the past decade due to loss of habitat, wildfires, hunting, and roadkill, and they are now considered a vulnerable species. An expert in brazil says she hopes the news of the incidents doesn't further threaten the animals: \" we have a lot of problems with this species because people believe that ( they ) bring bad luck and kill the animal on purpose. \" adding to the trouble: anteaters have poor vision and are known for being easily startled.",

Women tend to be more environmentally conscious than men on all kinds of levels, from energy use to concern about climate change, reports the washington post. So notre dame business professor james wilkie conducted seven experiments to see whether men \" avoid or even oppose green behaviors in order to safeguard their gender identity. \" the short answer, he reports in the journal of consumer research, is a resounding yes. Being \" green \" is equated with being feminine, and men tend to shy away from it. However, wilkie and his team suggest this can be changed with the right branding, per a notre dame press release. For example, men were more likely to donate to eco-friendly groups with more masculine logos. \" stereotypical feminine behavior and attitudes are more in parallel with taking care of the environment, \" wilkie says. \" male traits tend to conflict with this idea of maintaining a nice environment for other people. \" he goes so far as to suggest that men tend to be punished more than women for breaking gender norms — a man might get teased for ordering a \" girlie drink, \" which could lead to a fight — and thus may be protecting their gender identity not just for the sake of how they are viewed but for their own safety. The researchers point to products like body wash and diet colas that now have masculine branding, which simultaneously does not deter female consumers. So the bottom line, for the sake of the environment? if men are more secure in their manliness, they ' ll be \" less threatened by adopting a green product. \" ( here's why some men lie about their athleticism. )",

They found that men are more open to purchasing environmental products if their masculinity gets a branding boost. \"previous research shows that men tend to be more concerned about maintaining a masculine identity than women are with their feminine identity, \" wilkie says. \"we therefore thought that men might be more open to environmental products if we made them feel secure in their masculinity"

        "summary": "Wisconsin has handed big victories to bernie sanders and ted cruz — and to political junkies hoping to see the first contested convention in 40 years. The badger state results are a stinging setback to front-runners hillary clinton and donald trump, though the delegate math remains in their favor. A roundup of coverage: the big story isn't how badly trump did, but how well cruz did, according to nate silver at fivethirtyeight. Silver notes that with 49 % of the vote, cruz did far better in wisconsin than he did in neighboring states, and he won among demographic groups, including non-evangelicals, that didn't warm to him in the past. Trump — whose campaign blasted cruz as \" a trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination \" — now needs a big win in new york on april 19 to regain momentum, and polls suggest that he's likely to get one, the ap reports. When sanders first launched his campaign, nobody thought he would win a single state, but he has now won 15, including six of the last seven to vote ( plus the category of \" democrats abroad \" ), notes chris cillizza at the washington post. Clinton's lead may still be impossible for sanders to overcome, he writes, but sanders has guaranteed himself a voice in the party, and if clinton fails to win new york, she will be seen as \" limping to the nomination. \" a contested gop convention is looking more likely all the time, according to eric bradner at cnn. Trump is still the only candidate with a realistic chance of getting the necessary 1,237 delegates to wrap up the nomination before the convention, but the wisconsin loss makes that task a lot more difficult. Exit polls in wisconsin should worry both trump and the gop, the new york times reports. Only 29 % of those who made their decision late picked trump, and 37 % of gop primary voters said they would vote for clinton, a third-party candidate, or nobody if he became the party's nominee. Sanders is going to need more nights like tuesday to have a realistic shot at the nomination, notes harry enten at fivethirtyeight. He will have to score similar wins in states such as new york and pennsylvania, enten writes, and will have to do more to win over black voters, a group that he lost to clinton by more than 40 % in wisconsin.",

He's the attorney who on friday filed a federal lawsuit over california's democratic presidential primary, and the particulars of the case are a bit confusing as well. When californians elect california officials, they can vote for anyone on the ballot, regardless of party. The same isn't true for the political primaries, which take place in the state june 7. In this case, the parties make the rules. Only registered republicans can cast a ballot for a republican candidate, but the democrats are allowing residents with \" no party preference \" to vote — kind of. The bernie sanders-supporting voting rights defense project is among the plaintiffs, who want state elections officials to be required to launch a public awareness campaign between now and may 31, the last day for requesting a ballot by mail. The ballot by mail is the real point of contention. As kpcc explains, \" no party preference \" voters can ask for a \" crossover ballot \" that lets them vote in the democratic primary. Simpich tells the station that if they don't ask for that ballot, and write in sanders or hillary clinton on the blank ballot they will be sent, it \" won't count. \" a local voter analytics expert tells the san francisco chronicle, \" the democratic ( primary ) was sold to voters as an open primary, but... It's more like a closed primary with an option for people to get into it. \" and it's not a paltry sum: he says about 2.1 million independents vote via mail in the state. The plaintiffs would also like to see voter registration go right up to june 7. New york magazine notes the reported confusion is a legitimate concern for sanders, whose \" support among independents has given him a boost in almost every democratic primary to date. \"",

        "summary": "Archaeologists in turkey have uncovered one of the oldest human brains ever found, new scientist reports. The 4,000-year-old organ was found in seyitömer höyük, a bronze age settlement, and researchers think its owner was likely killed when an earthquake buried him under rubble. A fire probably then spread, eating up any oxygen in the rubble, and basically boiling the brain inside the skull. The lack of oxygen and moisture would explain how the brain tissue, which is soft and full of fat and typically breaks down quickly, was preserved. The soil also helped: it contains a lot of potassium, magnesium, and aluminum, which, when combined with human tissue and the fatty acids it contains, forms a substance known as \" corpse wax, \" which helped to preserve brain tissue. \" the level of preservation in combination with the age is remarkable, \" says one expert, who adds that brains like this can give us valuable information about the history of neurological disorders. Smithsonian points out that two years ago, a 2,600-year-old brain was found in a bog, whose similarly wet, moist conditions helped preserve it. ( another cool recent archaeological find: a town named in a well-known bible story. )",

A sightseeing chopper crash off the arizona memorial visitors center on thursday is the second accident of the year involving a tour helicopter and the sixth since 2011. A sightseeing helicopter that crashed into waters just off the arizona memorial visitors center has been recovered and is being transported to a honolulu hangar. The national transportation safety board is investigating the thursday morning crash, which critically injured a 15-year-old boy and left two others in serious condition. About 1 p.m. Friday, civilian divers and military personnel attached inflatable bags to the downed helicopter, and floated it to joint base pearl harbor-hickam. From there, the chopper was to be towed to honolulu airport. The chopper had been touring waimea and was returning to honolulu when it plunged into the water, to the disbelief of scores of visitors at the center. Five people were on board: the pilot and a family of four visiting from canada. The 15-year-old passenger remains in critical condition at pali momi medical center, a spokeswoman said. Another family member was taken the kaiser moanalua medical center in serious condition. The pilot, ryan rohner, was also seriously injured and was taken to tripler army medical center. Two others on the chopper, a 50-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman, were in stable condition at pali momi. Boat trips to the uss arizona memorial were canceled friday, though the visitor center was open.

A sightseeing chopper crash off the arizona memorial visitors center on thursday is the second accident of the year involving a tour helicopter and the sixth since 2011. A sightseeing helicopter that crashed into waters just off the arizona memorial visitors center has been recovered and is being transported to a honolulu hangar. The national transportation safety board is investigating the thursday morning crash, which critically injured a 15-year-old boy and left two others in serious condition. About 1 p.m. Friday, civilian divers and military personnel attached inflatable bags to the downed helicopter, and floated it to joint base pearl harbor-hickam. From there, the chopper was to be towed to honolulu airport. The chopper had been touring waimea and was returning to honolulu when it plunged into the water, to the disbelief of scores of visitors at the center. Five people were on board: the pilot and a family of four visiting from canada. The 15-year-old passenger remains in critical condition at pali momi medical center, a spokeswoman said. Another family member was taken the kaiser moanalua medical center in serious condition. The pilot, ryan rohner, was also seriously injured and was taken to tripler army medical center. Two others on the chopper, a 50-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman, were in stable condition at pali momi. Boat trips to the uss arizona memorial were canceled friday, though the visitor center was open. Rohner is a chief warrant officer 2 in the army national guard, and has years of experience flying helicopters commercially and in the military. He was flying a bell-206b chopper, operated by genesis aviation, when it came",

A surveillance video shows the formerly missing california woman sprinting near a jehovah's witness church in yolo county early on thanksgiving last year, shortly before she was found by a trucker on an interstate 5 ramp, per the san francisco chronicle. The black-and-white video released tuesday by the shasta county sheriff's office shows a barely visible papini at 4: 15am on nov. 24, dashing in the dark after she says she broke away from her captors. The shasta county woman is seen running toward the building, then away again until she runs out of frame. Less than 10 minutes later, papini was picked up on the ramp. Shasta county sheriff's sgt. Brian jackson tells people that papini approached the building looking for help, then turned because \" it was 4 o ' clock in the morning and there was nobody there. \" officials figured out it was papini because they could make out parts of her shackles, which she was found wearing, per cbs news. Jackson tells people authorities decided to release the video in the hopes it would bring new leads in the case. \" maybe there is that one person who can have that one piece of information that can help, \" he says. Krcr outlines what's known in the case so far, including documenting the evidence that's been revealed and the \" unanswered questions \" that remain, including what the brand papini received on her right shoulder was. Jackson concedes to newsweek, which examines the doubts some have about papini's story, that he gets why people believe there are \" inconsistencies \" and that the whole case is just \" weird. \" ( see police sketches of papini's captors here. )",

Blow, who is black, first brought the incident to light in a series of tweets in which he said that \" this is exactly why i have no patience for ppl trying to convince me that the fear these young blk men feel isn't real. \" today in the times, he explained further: as his son walked back to his dorm room, he noticed a campus police officer following him; the officer yelled at him to turn around, and when the younger blow did so, he tells his father, \" the officer raised his gun at me, and told me to get on the ground. \" he complied, answered questions about his name and his student status at yale, then stopped again after the officer initially appeared to be letting him go but then changed his mind. After he answered more questions and handed over his school id, a second officer finally explained that they had received a call about a burglary suspect who matched blow's description; that suspect was ultimately arrested, yale daily news reports. As blow writes in the times, he has no problem with his son being questioned if the descriptions really did match, but he takes issue with the way things went down. \" why was a gun drawn first? why was he not immediately told why he was being detained? why not ask for id first? \" blow writes. \" what if my son had panicked under the stress, having never had a gun pointed at him before, and made what the officer considered a'suspicious ' movement? had i come close to losing him? \" blow's full column is here.",

            "Washington ( reuters ) - president donald trump said on sunday he will offer details on how he would like to overhaul president barack obama's signature healthcare law in a speech to the u.s.

Reuters/joshua roberts since they now control the white house and congress, republicans are under pressure to fulfill their pledge to repeal and replace the obamacare law although they have found no easy way to do it.

Cnn and politico each offer five takeaways: wisconsin rejected rick santorum: it was santorum's last shot at winning a midwestern state, and he ignored maryland in order to hit what cnn calls the \" bowling alley-and-cheese curd circuit \" in wisconsin. It didn't work: his typical supporters, including evangelicals, tea partiers, and the \" very conservative, \" voted for romney anyway. Even so, he's not going anywhere: despite the fact that many seemed to believe a wisconsin loss would mean the end for santorum, he's still focused on denying romney the magic number of 1,144 delegates — and, for the time being, he still has a path to do so. All eyes are on pennsylvania: both romney and santorum have set the bar high for the april 24 primary in santorum's home state. Romney knows that a loss in pennsylvania could really spell doom for santorum, so he's in the state today for two days of campaigning. Polls are tight, and some romney supporters hope that santorum will ultimately leave the race ahead of the primary if he thinks he won't win. Endorsements are starting to make a difference: romney's vip supporters may have offered less-than-enthusiastic endorsements, but exit polls in wisconsin show that more than 60 % of republicans — most of them romney voters — were influenced by those endorsements. Things are looking good for scott walker and barack obama: wisconsin exit polls show that the governor has a lot of support as he faces a recall election in june. Meanwhile, in maryland and dc, obama scored enough delegates to secure the democratic nomination.

Duterte issued a nationwide executive order thursday banning smoking in all public places, including sidewalks. Cnn reports that smoking was previously banned in schools, clinics, and government buildings, but not workplaces or restaurants. Now anyone with a cigarette, be it electronic or tobacco, must light up exclusively in designated smoking areas. The move is meant to reduce the high smoking rate in the philippines, where, according to a who report, a quarter of the population smokes, including 11 % of minors. Among other things, the order prohibits tobacco advertising within 330 feet of schools and playgrounds. The new york times reports that offenders face $ 100 fines, a steep price in a nation where the average monthly salary is $ 400, and four months in jail. Duterte, who quit smoking after being diagnosed with two rare medical conditions years ago, called on civilians to partake in a \"smoke free task force \" and help catch offenders. While reuters reports that the ban has garnered support among health officials, others fear that a public task force may inspire vigilantes to take the law into their own hands, as was seen in in duterte's call to murder addicts and users in his war on drugs.",

        "summary": "The supreme court gathers monday for the last scheduled day of the current term, with decisions on six cases — including one on the separation of church and state — still to come. Overshadowing all that, however, is speculation about whether justice anthony kennedy will announce his retirement after 30 years on the bench. Details: kennedy: if the 81-year-old is indeed stepping down, he would have told president trump by now. But kellyanne conway wasn't giving any hints: \" i will never reveal a conversation between a sitting justice and the president or the white house, \" she said on abc news sunday. Don't bet on it: david lat of above the law assesses the kennedy rumors and weighs in on the chances of retirement: \" highly unlikely. \" the six cases: scotusblog provides quick snapshots of the six cases on which decisions are pending. A big one is trinity lutheran church v. Comer, which involves a missouri church that sought to use state funds designated for nonprofits to build a playground. Travel ban: one wild card is that the court also could make an announcement related to trump's travel ban. A post at lawfare runs through six possibilities, including the announcement of a special session in july to hear arguments. One key question expected to be answered as soon as monday: will the justices keep lower courts'temporary injunctions in place or allow the ban to take effect until a decision is reached? slate assesses. Back to drawing board? three of the six cases still pending, all of which involve immigrants or foreigners, were argued before trump appointee neil gorsuch took the bench, notes the ap. It's possible the court could decide that some or all be re-argued before the nine-member court. Among them is hernandez v. Mesa, on whether the family of a mexican teen who was killed by a us border patrol agent can sue over a fourth amendment violation regarding the use of deadly force. Next term: the court also is expected to announce whether some high-profile cases will be on the docket next year. Two notable ones involve gun rights and the second amendment, and breitbart has details.",

After he pulled out his phone and started recording, flores got footage of the officer taking the vendor's wallet and pocketing the money he found. That night flores posted the video on facebook, where it has been viewed 11.4 million times, the los angeles times reports. Thus far, flores ' gofundme page has raised more than $ 37,000 to cover the vendor's \" legal and personal [ losses ] \" and \" to cover other vendors who have been robbed of their hard earned living through citations and removal of their carts. \" but uc police sgt. Sabrina reich told ktvu that the vendor was cited for selling without a permit and that the money, $ 60, was taken as \" suspected proceeds of the violation and booked into evidence. \" flores, however, says the officer gave the vendor the citation as people were drinking in public nearby, also a crime. \" this was about identifying one vendor, \" flores says. \" if you want law and order, be law and order across the board. \"",

The living history museum at virginia's 18th-century capital announced plans thursday to contract with outside companies to run its golf, landscaping, retail, and other operations. The restructuring will include some layoffs at the site, where costumed actors re-enact life in colonial times amid the historic buildings. According to the virginia gazette, one major change includes closing the kimball theatre, which hasn't been profitable since 1999 and lost $ 782,000 last year. Under the restructuring, 71 employees will be laid off by the end of the year; another 262 could eventually be affected. The nonprofit colonial williamsburg foundation said it suffered operating losses last year of $ 54 million — or $ 148,000 per day. President mitchell reiss says williamsburg attracts half the visitors it did 30 years ago. It also had more than $ 300 million in debt at the end of 2016. \"if we are going to rededicate ourselves to our core educational mission, we can no longer do everything the way we did in 1976, or 1986 or even 2006, \" reiss says.",

From 1pm on oct. 13 to 7pm on oct. 14, six contestants will each lie down in a 2-by-7-foot coffin, where they ' ll have to stay for the duration, save for one six-minute bathroom break each hour. What's allowed: a pillow and blanket, a cellphone to while away the time, and a friend, though that friend will have to leave when the park closes and can't come back till opening time the next day. Six flags will provide meals, drinks, and snacks. Wsb-tv notes it's unclear whether the coffin lid will be shut on participants or propped open, though it surmises ( \" for health and liability reasons \" ) it will likely be an open-casket endeavor. If more than one contestant makes it the whole 30 hours, there will be a drawing to see who keeps the cash, but anyone who completes the task will receive two gold season passes, free passes for certain fright fest attractions, and an extra prop for their halloween decor: their casket.

Democrats also lost another seat in north dakota and failed to flip a vulnerable one in tennessee. Meanwhile, the gop's ted cruz won in texas, while the race in florida was too close to call. Notable if unsurprising winners elsewhere included republican mitt romney in utah and democratic incumbent tim kaine in virginia. More details: missouri. Republican josh hawley defeated democratic sen. Claire mccaskill by a 55-42 margin, the st. Louis post-dispatch reports. Tennessee: republican marsha blackburn will keep the seat in gop hands. She defeated democrat phil bredesen to replace the retiring bob corker, a republican, reports the hill. Florida: democratic sen. Bill nelson vs. Republican rick scott. This is shaping up to be a nail-biter based on partial returns. North dakota: democratic sen. Heidi heitkamp lost her seat to republican challenger kevin cramer. New jersey: democratic sen.

Cara koscinski had ordered the cake online through publix, requesting that it include the message \" summa cum laude \" to signal the high honors jacob had received. But because publix's algorithm apparently deemed the middle word ( which means \" with \" in the latin phrase ) a profane one, it automatically generated three hyphens in its place: the cake revealed at the party read \" summa --- laude. \" \" utterly ridiculous, \" koscinski wrote on her facebook page. The washington post tried to order a cake on the publix site using the same phrase and got an alert that said \" profane/special characters not allowed. \" koscinski notes when she got that message, she explained the meaning of the phrase in the \" special instructions \" field and included a link to a site that explained it more fully. The hyphenated replacement for the omitted word actually made things worse for jacob, who called the whole thing \" frustrating and humiliating. \" \" i had to explain to my friends and family … what that meant, \" he tells wciv. \" they were giggling uncontrollably. \" publix offered to redo the cake, but jacob's mom turned it down, as the graduation party had already passed.

Researchers in australia found that people were better able to remember something if they were naturally curious about the subject, reports livescience. That wasn't too surprising. The more intriguing part of the study showed that once a person's curiosity is piqued about anything, the brain gets fired up and is better able to learn about other subjects, too, explains the washington post. Using mri scans, the researchers discovered that regions of the brain associated with memory and reward light up when a person gets curious. \"there are times when people feel they can take in a lot of new information, and other times when they feel their memories are terrible, \" a researcher tells the guardian. \"this work suggests that once you light that fire of curiosity, you put the brain in a state that's more conducive to learning. \" the brain, he adds, \" becomes more like a sponge that's ready to soak up whatever is happening. \" researchers followed up with their subjects a full day after their tests and found that the effects still held.

( here's a summary of how it works ). It's a \" vile absurdity \" that congress has forced this fight in the first place, so \" using an accounting trick to negate it is entirely appropriate, \" writes krugman in the new york times. If the debt limit is not raised, the president would either have to borrow money against the wishes of congress or refuse to spend money congress told him to spend, krugman writes. Either way, he would be breaking the law. What's worse, defaulting on the nation's debt would be \" disastrous \" for the economy and markets. Rather than buckle to republicans trying to hold the economy hostage, the $ 1 trillion platinum coin would be both legal and effective. It's \" better to look slightly silly than to let a financial and constitutional crisis explode, \" writes krugman. Read the full column here.

Per a stipulation signed by a judge last week, the us forest service will delay its tree-thinning project there until it consults with the us fish and wildlife service on whether a particular frog is being put at risk. The yellow-legged frog, already an endangered species, has a \" designated critical habitat \" on land in the upper echo lakes where officials have been burning or taking away trees to reduce the chance of wildfires. Biologist dennis murphy — whose lawsuit started the case, and who owns a seasonal home at upper echo lake — said in a statement cited by the ap that the forest service \" put on blinders to the impacts of the project hoping no one would notice. \" murphy also accused officials of not doing their due diligence of studying how the tree-burning would affect the frog species and its natural habitat ( the frog was once the \" most abundant amphibian in the high mountain lakes of the sierra nevada, \" notes the national park service ). The forest service, which declined to comment, wrapped up about 40 % of the project before the government closed it down. ( elsewhere, say hello to the world's newest toad. )",

Researchers looked at the usefulness of acetaminophen in managing low back pain and osteoarthritis of the hip or knee — and they found that in such cases, the drug works no better or, at most, only slightly better than a placebo. Specifically, acetaminophen was ineffective in helping with low back pain and only minimally beneficial — not enough to be considered clinically significant — for managing osteoarthritis, according to the study published in bmj. The findings are significant, researchers note, since acetaminophen is generally recommended as the \" first line analgesic \" in these cases. \" the american guidelines were published in 2007, when the evidence was weaker, \" the study's senior author explains to the new york times. \" it is time to review the recommendations. \" the researchers looked at a number of trials involving a total of 5,366 patients; oral dosage varied from 3000mg per day to 4000mg per day ( one trial involved an iv dose of 1000mg ). Tylenol currently recommends no more than 3000mg per day, down from the previous recommendation of 4000mg. The study also suggests that taking acetaminophen can nearly quadruple the risk of getting abnormal results on a liver function test; the lead author tells the cbc it's not clear whether that could lead to liver damage in the long term but that it is \" a concern. \" medical news today noted last month that another large trial last year found similar results in terms of acetaminophen's usefulness in managing low back pain — and that a study this year found that doctors may be underestimating the risks of the drug, even at standard doses.

Rosselló is also calling on the 5.3 million puerto ricans living on the mainland to come out in force in 2018 following the passage of the republican tax bill, which he says will hurt puerto rico, newsweek reports. \"we are a significant voting bloc in the united states that perhaps hasn't been organized very well in the past, \" rosselló says.
