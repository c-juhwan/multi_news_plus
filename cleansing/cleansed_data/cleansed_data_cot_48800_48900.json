        "summary": "She married the love of her life and believes she was fired for it. Jocelyn morffi, a first-grade teacher at miami's saints peter and paul catholic school, was terminated thursday, days after marrying her same-sex partner of two years, reports the miami herald. A friend says morffi was told she had to resign wednesday, her first day back at school since the feb. 3 wedding, and was fired when she refused. Though morffi says there's no question why she was terminated — \" in their eyes i ' m not the right kind of catholic for my choice in partner, \" she writes on instagram — some 20 parents arrived at the school friday demanding answers. \" we were extremely livid. They treated her like a criminal, they didn't even let her get her things out of her classroom, \" says one, noting morffi \" by far was one of the best teachers out there. \" morffi had worked at the school for almost seven years, coached basketball, and took students to deliver meals to the homeless on weekends, a friend says. She's \" made such a contribution to the school. She never imposes her personal beliefs on others. She just does everything in love, \" says an \" outraged \" parent. Nonetheless, a spokesperson for the archdiocese of miami says morffi violated her contract, which notes teachers may be fired for conduct \" inconsistent \" with catholic teachings. Other teachers received verbal warnings simply for attending the wedding, reports abc news. A mother tells the herald she's withdrawing her child from the school as a result. Noting no state laws prohibit discrimination on sexual orientation, the director of a lgbt rights group says he hopes the \" shocking \" case will encourage people to fight for change.",

        "summary": "Two cases of youngsters losing their lives in hot cars are making headlines this week. Skylar fowler, 1, became the first child to die in a hot car in georgia this year in a june 15 incident that's emerging following mother dijanelle fowler's monday arrest. The atlanta journal-constitution reports she is charged with second-degree murder, child cruelty, and concealing the death of her daughter, whom cops say was left in fowler's car for six hours while she got her hair done. Dekalb county police believe the death was accidental; the 25-year-old left the car running with air conditioning on, but at some point between her 10am appointment and 4pm return to the car, the car died. Wxia reports video and witness statements indicate fowler didn't leave the salon at any point during that six-hour period. Reuters quotes a police rep who says fowler hid the baby in some manner and called roadside assistance for help in restarting her car; other reports suggest someone from the salon helped her jump her battery. Fowler then drove to emory university hospital, where she parked, called 911, and said she herself was suffering from some kind of seizure. Skylar was found by the responding team. The knoxville news sentinel has a more vague report of a child found dead around 2pm friday in gatlinburg, tenn., following a report of a child being left in a car overnight. A neighbor confirmed the home address, and a search of records revealed it belongs to jerry kirkman, mayor of westmoreland, tenn.

Researchers found that between 1992 and 2011, sea levels rose more around antarctica than in the southern ocean as a whole. \" freshwater is less dense than salt water, and so in regions where an excess of freshwater has accumulated we expect a localized rise in sea level, \" the author of a study published in nature explains to the bbc. The researchers say their models suggest freshwater runoff, not natural fluctuations, is the only explanation for the 2mm-per-year rise. \" we can estimate the amount of water that wind is pushing onto the continental shelf, and show with some certainty that it is very unlikely that this wind forcing is causing the sea level rise, \" the lead researcher says. The researchers say the freshening of the water may explain growth in sea ice in the area, though that growth comes as new satellite-produced maps show that ice sheets on land are melting at an unprecedented rate, the guardian notes. ( last month, researchers revealed that they had found life half a mile below the west antarctic ice sheet. )",

John fleming's facebook page, where he links to the onion article with this note: \" more on planned parenthood, abortion by the wholesale. \" sadly, while fleming's page still features an impressive number of anti-planned parenthood posts, this particular one appears to have been removed. Lest you have forgotten who fleming is, in september he whined about having to survive on just $ 600,000 per year, leading jon stewart to give him some budgeting tips.

The company made the announcement friday, explaining that it now has less of a chance of winning its appeal at the supreme court, the wall street journal reports. In 2013, dow was found liable of allegedly conspiring to fix prices for an industrial chemical between 2000 and 2003, the ap reports; the company was asking the supreme court to overturn that decision. But now, with the high court evenly split between typically conservative and typically liberal justices, any split decision would revert back to the original opinion by the lower court, in this case the kansas federal court that ruled against dow. Dow's move could end up being a sign of things to come, as businesses grapple with the fact that the supreme court no longer has a conservative majority. \" i think most corporations facing class actions regarded justice scalia as a friend, \" the president of the center for constitutional litigation in washington tells the ap. \" he has been a thoroughly consistent vote on their side of the equation. \" even so, the journal notes that even with scalia on the bench, dow may have lost its appeal, and the company came close to settling last year. \" with this changing landscape, the unknowns, we just decided to put this behind us, \" a dow spokesperson says.

Schulze, who held more than 20 percent of richfield, minnesota-based best buy as of june, plans to contribute $ 1 billion in equity from that stake, the letter shows. The rest of the money will come from what the letter calls \"premier private-equity firms with deep experience in retail who are interested in a possible acquisition of best buy \" and debt financing. Standard &amp; poor's and fitch ratings cut the company's credit rating to junk on the prospect of additional borrowings. \"i have been actively exploring all available options for my ownership stake, \" schulze, 71, said in the letter. \"that exploration has reinforced my belief that bold and extensive changes are needed for best buy to return to market leadership and has led me to the conclusion that the company's best chance for renewed success will be to implement these changes under a different ownership structure. \" best buy confirmed in an e-mailed statement that it had received the letter from schulze and said its board would consider it \"in due course. \" through a spokesman, schulze declined to comment on the letter. Shares surge best buy advanced 13 percent to $ 19.99 at the close in new york for the biggest gain since march 2009. The shares failed to rise to the offer price after analysts said a deal may be difficult to complete. The possibility of higher debt prompted standard &amp; poor's to cut the retailer's credit rating one level to bb+, the first level below investment grade, jayne m. Ross, an analyst for s&p, said today in a statement. The rating remains on watch negative, which means it may be reduced further. Fitch also cut the rating to bb+ with a negative watch, while moody's investors service reaffirmed its rating of baa2, the second-lowest investment-grade rating, and moved the outlook to developing from stable.

Last month, however, the fire department decided to drop the rule, the new york times reports. After all, only once in the rule's 40 years of existence has a helicopter picked people up from a roof, officials say. \" the helipad regulation has hindered la from having an iconic, memorable skyline in a city that desperately needs a stronger urban identity, \" says a realtor. Now, instead of flat tops, buildings of more than 75 feet must have an extra-fast firefighter elevator, a third set of stairs, and video surveillance outside each new elevator, the times notes. Firefighters are generally approving of the change; in fact, they say la's new skyscrapers will be america's safest, the los angeles times reports. \" this just made absolute sense to do this, \" says the city's fire chief. But an architect wonders whether we ' ll really see a more beautiful city: \" now that the restriction is lifted, will the result be a more elegant high rise or just another spire reaching to make a building the tallest in the west? \" the west's new tallest building is, in fact, already under construction; builders wanted to put a spire on top of the 73-story wilshire grand center, spurring the rule change.

Sure, some of the proposals have merit — putting a public advocate on the fisa court, removing the control of metadata from the nsa — but even if all are adopted, they will do very little to end the nsa's practice of \" suspicion-less spying aimed at hundreds of millions of people in the us and around the world, \" writes glenn greenwald in the guardian. He doesn't sound surprised, though, summing up the ways of obama with a particularly scathing passage: \" he prettifies the ugly; he drapes the banner of change over systematic status quo perpetuation; he makes americans feel better about policies they find repellent without the need to change any of them in meaningful ways. He's not an agent of change but the soothing branding packaging for it. \" greenwald's silver lining: public criticism forced this \" first step, \" and continued pressure might eventually make it clear to dc that \" cosmetic gestures are plainly inadequate. \" click to read his full column.

        "summary": "The american health care act passed by house republicans earlier this month will reduce the deficit by $ 119 billion over the next decade — while leaving 23 million more americans without insurance than if obamacare remains in place, according to the congressional budget office's score of the bill released wednesday. Npr reports that while premiums could go down for some people under the ahca, the cbo warns of \" extremely high premiums \" for people with preexisting conditions. Insurance could also be thousands of dollars more expensive for people who are pregnant or have issues with addiction or mental health. The ahca would reduce the deficit by cutting medicaid by $ 884 billion and subsidies for individual health insurance by $ 276 billion. Whether or not insurance premiums go up for americans under the ahca depends partly on what state they live in. The ahca allows for states to get waivers that would lower premiums by allowing cheaper plans that don't cover \" major medical risks. \" but it also largely depends on age, as vox explains. A 64-year-old making $ 26,500 a year would pay between $ 13,600 and $ 16,100 for insurance under the ahca, depending on if their state gets waivers. That's up from $ 1,700 under obamacare. A 64-year-old making $ 68,200 would also see their premiums increase if they live in a state that doesn't get the waivers. That's because the ahca allows insurers to charge older people up to five times as much as younger people. The washington post reports the senate is unlikely to pass the ahca as it stands and is working on its own bill.",

        "summary": "An inquest has blamed the death of an american banker who underwent a routine heart valve operation in britain on a nurse's mistaken move, reports the telegraph. Robert entenman died in 2015 at age 57 at one of britain's biggest private hospitals, london bridge. The american, who left the us in the early ' 80s and worked at major investment banks throughout europe, had mitral valve disease, type 2 diabetes, and a high bmi of 42, but he had been expected to recover from the procedure. Having been on a ventilator for a week following surgery, entenman went into cardiac arrest and suffered from a lack of oxygen to his brain after his endotracheal tube became clogged with mucus. Last week, an inquest found that his death was the result of the hospital's neglect, reports the sun. The surgeon told the court he'd put the probability of successful heart valve repair at 99 %, and that days after the operation his patient had recovered enough to shake hands, reports the standard. But after entenman complained about being too hot due to broken air conditioning, a nurse turned off the ventilator's humidifier, thinking it would help, the inquest was told. Unfortunately, the device helps prevent secretions from building up and has nothing to do with body temperature. It was off for 18 hours, at which point entenman went into cardiac arrest. Hospital staff found a \" dark brown solid mucus plug \" depriving him of oxygen in the endotracheal tube. A ct scan revealed significant brain damage, and the father of two died days later.

Indeed, as more and more people rely on gps, the human ability to navigate as a whole could suffer, researchers at university college london tell live science. They took volunteers on a tour of london's soho district, then recorded their brain activity as they completed 10 video simulations requiring them to navigate those streets. In five simulations the volunteers navigated alone, leading to increased activity in the parts of the brain responsible for route planning, especially when at junctions. But when they were given directions, a la gps, these parts of the brain essentially turned off, reports new atlas. \" the hippocampus simulates journeys on future possible paths while the prefrontal cortex helps us to plan which ones will get us to our destination, \" study author hugo spiers explains. \" when we have technology telling us which way to go, however, these parts of the brain simply don't respond. \" this study backs up research suggesting gps causes people to ignore their surroundings. But researchers say there could be greater implications to a reliance on gps. Spiers describes the brain as a muscle and navigating london as \" bodybuilding, \" per scientific american. Using gps means the brain doesn't get its exercise, he says. A researcher theorizes that the hippocampus may begin to develop differently in humans over time.

        "summary": "The us government recognizes three wolf species in north america: the red wolf, eastern wolf, and gray wolf. Two, it turns out, aren't true wolf at all. In a new genetic study, scientists at ucla say the gray wolf is the last wolf species on the continent and all others are simply hybrids. After studying the genomes of eastern wolves, red wolves, gray wolves, and coyotes, they found \" no evidence for distinct eastern or red wolf species, \" study author robert wayne tells the los angeles times. In fact, the red wolf found in the southern us has about 25 % gray wolf and 75 % coyote ancestry, while the eastern wolf of central ontario has about 75 % gray wolf and 25 % coyote ancestry. Scientists say the two species began mixing hundreds of years ago in the american south and about a century ago in the great lakes area. Previous research has found genetic and morphological evidence that the red and eastern wolves are unique, so this study might not have the final word, reports the new scientist. But it could have consequences: the gray wolf is protected under the endangered species act based on a traditional geographic range including the great lakes region and 29 eastern states. But in 2014, the us fish and wildlife service proposed removing the animal's protections because it found the eastern wolf occupied that territory instead, making the gray wolf listing invalid. This study shows the gray wolf did live in the range and \" should keep its endangered species status, \" wayne says in a release. A decision could come this fall.

Bill clinton will headline the evening four years after giving what cbs news calls a better pitch for president obama than even obama himself gave during the 2012 dnc. \"for a generation now, this has been a safe bet: if it's a democratic convention, mr. Clinton will be making a speech people will remember, \" the new york times states. But there's another name that could once again take center stage: bernie sanders. The washington post reports the clinton and sanders campaigns are working together to give sanders a bigger role tuesday, including sanders possibly being the one to formally nominate clinton, in order to calm protests. Tuesday will see the state roll call to officially nominate clinton for president. In 2008, clinton stopped the roll call to allow obama to be nominated without further delay. Cbs reports sanders isn't expected to do the same. It's possible giving sanders'delegates the chance to officially vote for him will be enough to soothe some vocal clinton critics, according to the times. Either way, the roll call will mark a historic moment: the first time a major party has nominated a woman for president. The official theme for tuesday is \" a lifetime of fighting for children and families, \" with a focus on gun violence. To that end, the mothers of eric garner and trayvon martin are scheduled to speak. Other speakers include jimmy carter, nancy pelosi, and lena dunham.",

The telegraph reports that if the younger boy was indeed taken by the saltwater crocodile, it would mark the sixth time a \" saltie \" has killed a child in the last 12 years, and that's led to renewed calls for a cull. Laws protecting the salties were put in place in 1971, and their ranks have swelled since, with as many as 100,000 of them occupying the northern territory. Sky news reports officials are going to great lengths in an effort to recover the boy's body: a trap has been set in magela creek, which feeds the waterhole; air, land, and boat searches have taken place; and any croc measuring more than 6.5 feet can be shot. And so far, two have, though slicing them open revealed no human remains. And the search efforts have been hampered by seasonal flooding, while has swelled the creek from a width of about 650 feet to more than 3,000 feet. The 15-year-old who was attacked was grabbed on his right arm and then his left, reports cnn. Based on the bite marks, the crocodile is believed to measure eight to nine feet. ( a 26-year-old was killed by a croc in the area last year; more on that here. ) meanwhile, australia has already launched another cull: of sharks.",

        "summary": "\" when i close my eyes, i see the oxygen masks dangling in front of me. \" that's the lingering anxiety of a passenger on a recent air china flight that plummeted thousands of feet after oxygen levels dropped. A senior official from the civil aviation administration of china tells cnn the reason for the descent stems from a co-pilot smoking an e-cigarette. The official says the pilot tried to shut off air-recycling fans so the vapor wouldn't reach the cabin, but \" toggled the wrong switches, \" causing air pressure to drop. After the plane fell tuesday during a three-hour flight from hong kong to the chinese city of dalian, pilots were able to bring the plane back to around 25,000 feet, and it landed safely. Various sources are listing different numbers for how far the plane actually dropped, but flight data cited by newsweek shows an approximately 21,000-foot decrease over 18 minutes. Per the south china morning post, a couple of the passengers posted pics and video on social media showing people donning the oxygen masks that came down, though the mood was relatively calm. \" the announcement from the cockpit said the ability to increase oxygen in the cabin malfunctioned so the plane lost pressure, \" one wrote on weibo. Reuters notes that even though china's airlines have a pretty decent safety record, pilots are sometimes accused by passengers of smoking during flights. China bars flight crews from \" smoking on all phases of operation, \" and passengers there haven't been able to use e-cigarettes on planes since 2006. Air china says it will \" adopt a zero-tolerance attitude and seriously punish those found responsible, \" depending on the results of the caac's probe.",

But matter and antimatter destroy each other when they come in contact; an equal amount of each means the universe should have blinked out of existence in a burst of energy. But it hasn't, which means there must be some difference between the two to allow matter to dominate to the point where there is comparatively little antimatter in the universe, according to a press release. That's where cern researchers come in. They've spent the past decade attempting to find a difference in the magnetism of matter and antimatter ( it's not easy measuring something that destroys matter ). That's resulted in a new measurement of the magnetic moment of an antiproton that is 350 times more accurate than the old measurement, zme science reports. It turns out the magnetic moment of an antiproton is... Pretty much exactly the same as that of a regular proton. Shoot. Smorra says a difference between matter and antimatter still must exist somewhere. Next up for cern researchers is seeing if gravity affects protons and antiprotons differently. ( far from not existing, the universe actually contains way more galaxies than we thought. )",

The syndrome attacks a patient's immune system, and though there is no proof of a link, guillain-barré was thought to be rare in brazil until last year when 554 cases were reported in areas worst hit by the zika virus, per the telegraph. Colombia, venezuela, and el salvador — where women have been warned not to get pregnant — have also seen an increase in guillain-barré cases as the zika virus spreads. Many patients had symptoms of zika one to two weeks before experiencing paralysis. \" i estimate that zika increases by about 20 times the probability that an individual can get guillain-barré, \" says a doctor who's treated the \" nightmare \" condition, which strikes about 1 in 100,000. \" it felt like i was drowning in a sea of mud, \" says one patient. \" i became motionless and thought i would die. All of this happened just a few days after i had zika. \" another patient had to be put on a ventilator for 40 days once the paralysis reached her breathing muscles.

Per cbc, hassan al kontar spent the last seven months living in the kuala lumpur airport and documenting on twitter his life in flux as he attempted to find a country willing to issue him a visa as a refugee. On monday, malaysian authorities accused the 36-year-old of being in a \" forbidden zone \" without a boarding pass and arrested him, per the new straits times. At a press conference, malaysia's immigration department director-general datuk seri mustafar ali reportedly said that al kontar said he's unwilling to return to syria because he fears he ' ll be forced to become a soldier after years spent working abroad as an insurance marketing manager. Mustafar said his agency doesn't know al kontar's \" real reason \" but cited his country's need for closure in the case. Mustafar also said al kontar had \" shamed \" malaysia on social media. Throughout his ordeal, a human rights group out of british columbia had been working to secure a canadian visa for al kontar by putting public pressure on canada's minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship. Malaysian officials did not say at the time of his arrest whether al kontar would be deported.",

The researchers confirm that after months of work they have found evidence of an extensive tequesta indian village dating back up to 2,000 years on what they believe was part of the city's original shoreline. The site where a developer plans to build movie theaters, restaurants, and a 34-story hotel has also produced thousands of artifacts. Npr in november spoke to chief archeologist bob carr, who gave a brief history of the tequesta. \" they probably encountered ponce de leon, \" he said, along with the founder of st. Augustine. Those meetings would have kicked off their demise; carr believes the thousands-strong population was whittled to fewer than 300 within 200 years of encountering europeans. But the site they left behind is \" one of the earliest urban plans in eastern north america, \" carr tells the miami herald. \" you can actually see this extraordinary configuration of these buildings and structures. \" and it has yielded more bits of history: \" sandwiched over \" the site were artifacts from fort dallas, which factored into two of the seminole indian wars of the 1800s, and from henry flagler's 1897 royal palm hotel, which the herald describes as having \" prompted the founding of the city of miami. \" preservation officials have called for a major redesign of the entertainment complex project to save as much of the site as possible. They note that while mdm development group could be out a lot of money, it was well aware of the risk it was taking when it bought the land, which falls inside a designated archeological zone. Though the true significance of the site only became clear after the last six months of work, carr has been making discoveries there since 2005.

The new york times has a story with a similar tack, headlined \" boy at home in u.s., swayed by one who wasn't, \" that plays off this paragraph: \" the older one, who friends and family members said exerted a strong influence on his younger sibling — ' he could manipulate him, ' an uncle said — once told a photographer, ' i don't have a single american friend. I don't understand them. ' \" in its profile of the brothers, cnn writes that dzhokhar started going to the gym at age 10 to be with his boxer brother: \" dzhokar followed tamerlan around like a puppy. He'd be just behind him, doing calisthenics. \" one reason why all this might matter: if dzhokhar's defense team makes the case that it was tamerlan who was the driving force behind the plot, it could mean the difference between life and death for him. \" if he says my intent was to please my brother, they could raise the question of federal jurisdiction, \" says attorney alan dershowitz in a separate cnn story. If the case remains under state jurisdiction as a result, dzhokhar would escape the death penalty, which isn't in place in massachusetts.",

        "summary": "A new study finds that there's an evolutionary reason men prefer women with a \" theoretically optimal angle of lumbar curvature. \" another way of putting it? even prehistoric guys probably liked a gal with a curvy backside. Researchers at the university of texas at austin ran a two-part study, published in evolution and human behavior: in the first part, men rated the attractiveness of manipulated images of spinal curves; most best liked a 45.5-degree curve from back to buttocks. In the second part, men were shown pictures of women with different buttock sizes — and they still most preferred the ones whose spinal curvature was closest to the ideal, meaning it's the lumbar curvature they like, not just \" big butts, \" researchers say in a press release. But \" men may be directing their attention to the butt and obtaining information about women's spines, even if they are unaware that that is what their minds are doing, \" the lead researcher explains, per medical daily. As for that evolutionary reason for the preference, researchers attribute it to \" prehistoric influences. \" explains the lead researcher, \" this spinal structure would have enabled pregnant women to balance their weight over the hips. These women would have been more effective at foraging during pregnancy and less likely to suffer spinal injuries. In turn, men who preferred these women would have had mates who were better able to provide for fetus and offspring, and who would have been able to carry out multiple pregnancies without injury. \" researchers note that this preference has evolved over thousands of years. \" this adds to a growing body of evidence that beauty is not entirely arbitrary, or ' in the eyes of the beholder, ' \" says a co-author, \" but rather has a coherent adaptive logic. \" ( another recent study uncovered the surprising reason we hate zits. )",

The study, published online in evolution and human behavior, investigated men's mate preference for women with a \"theoretically optimal angle of lumbar curvature, \" a 45.5 degree curve from back to buttocks allowing ancestral women to better support, provide for, and carry out multiple pregnancies. \"what's fascinating about this research is that it is yet another scientific illustration of a close fit between a sex-differentiated feature of human morphology — in this case lumbar curvature — and an evolved standard of attractiveness, \" said the study's co-author david buss, a ut austin psychology professor. \"this adds to a growing body of evidence that beauty is not entirely arbitrary, or 'in the eyes of the beholder ' as many in mainstream social science believed, but rather has a coherent adaptive logic. \" this research, led by ut austin alumnus and bilkent university psychologist david lewis, consisted of two studies.

The research, presented at the american sociological association's annual meeting in august, culled almost 40 years of data from the university of chicago's national general social survey, in which more than 51,000 us adults were asked to rate their typical happiness level as \" very happy, \" \" pretty happy, \" or \" not too happy. \" researchers then compared data from various groups, including the never-marrieds, the still-marrieds, divorced people, and those who had lost their spouses. The scientists also broke it down further for people ages 60 and older, as widowed and divorced people tend to be on the older side. To their surprise, the researchers found \" never-married, older women are, in a lot of years [ of the survey ], indistinguishable from... Married older women, \" co-researcher gary ralph lee says, noting the same didn't hold true on the men's side — never-married males tended to have the same happiness levels as divorced and widowed men. The survey didn't allow for more insight into why the older ladies seem to be more content, though lee mentions it could be that they've learned to adapt to being single and they instead draw satisfaction from careers, friends, and family. While not speaking specifically to the older female demographic, d ' marge does point out a few studies that have suggested singles exercise more, maintain better social networks, and may not be as vulnerable to depression as their married friends.

Using the national survey of families and households ( 1992 – 1994 ) and the general social survey ( 2000, 2004, 2006, 2012 ), we examine ties to relatives, neighbors, and friends among u.s. Adults. We find that single individuals are more likely to frequently stay in touch with, provide help to, and receive help from parents, siblings, neighbors, and friends than the married. These differences between the single and the married are more prominent for the never married than for the previously married, suggesting that marriage extends its reach after it ends.

Kelley says king, who had reportedly been drinking and smoking weed, banged on the window of their house around 5am yesterday and then she heard a splash. But friends heard her tell the story a few times and say she altered it just a bit each time, and they've told both tmz and the police they fear she's hiding something. Meanwhile, in the los angeles times, kurt streeter recalls his series of interviews with king this year, and writes that king was still drinking and still smoking pot ( for medical reasons, he said ). \" what i witnessed was a man still struggling against alcohol, \" streeter writes, though king always appeared in control when the two saw each other and insisted he could manage his addiction. Despite his continuing struggles, streeter writes, king appeared to be \" headed in a positive direction, \" with a new book coming out, hopes for a movie about his life, and a loving fiancée. Hauntingly, streeter also recalls that in the pool where he would eventually drown, king had inscribed two dates: 3/31/91, when he was beaten by police, and 4/29/92, when the resulting la riots occurred. \" i thought of putting the number of people who died [ in the riots ] down there on the wall, the number 54, \" king once said. \" but that would be too much.

Because the etching was found on the layer of wall that dates to the early 17th century, it's possible the drawing is a self-portrait of raleigh, fox news reports. The telegraph reports the head is shown in profile and is crowned with a laurel wreath, which dr. Agnieszka sadraei, the historic buildings curator for the charity that manages the tower, said might be significant: \" raleigh was a poet and it is possible that he could have been represented wearing such a wreath in an antique fashion, \" though wreaths were also used at the time when illustrating kings. Tourists may inadvertently be responsible for the find. Visitors are believed to have \" knocked the wall, \" as the telegraph puts it, and a wall-paintings specialist spotted black coloring peeking through. As for raleigh, he bounced between favor and disgrace: queen elizabeth i sent him to explore north and south america, but had him imprisoned in the tower of london when he wed one of her ladies in waiting without first seeking her approval. Two more imprisonments followed under james i, one that lasted 13 years. ( another discovery, this one toxic, was made amid a trio of rare books. )",

Genetics, researchers suggest, could be to blame for almost half the difference among people in whether we suffer the day after drinking. In a survey, study authors asked some 4,000 people on the australian twin registry about the frequency of their hangovers in the past year. They found that both hangover frequency and hangover resistance appeared to be correlated between identical twins, pointing to a possible genetic explanation behind the suffering, livescience reports. More specifically, genetics appeared to be 45 % of the reason behind variation in women's hangover experiences, while the figure for men was 40 %.

There, 19-year-old noura hussein was sentenced to death thursday for the stabbing death of her husband, whom she says she was made to marry and who then raped her with the help of his family. The guardian reports hussein was married off at the age of 15 or 16 ( a change.org petition says that's merely when she was told she had to go through with the marriage ), but she fled and holed up with an aunt for three years — until she was fooled into a visit to the home of her own family, who promptly returned her to the man she was made to marry. After less than a week with him, she says, his brother and two others held her down while he raped her, and the next day when he tried it again, she stabbed him and fled to her parents, who brought her to the cops. Cnn notes the legal age of marriage in sudan is 10, and that marital rape isn't against the law. Under sharia, the husband's family could choose a pardon, financial compensation, or death for hussein, per the washington post; they chose death. \" when i left the court house the rapist's family were clapping with joy and had smug looks on their faces, \" a supporter who of hussein's posted on twitter. Hussein has plenty of people backing her up, and her cause has found its way online with a #justicefornoura hashtag and via the change.org petition, which calls her actions self-defense. \" it was a shocking moment \" hearing she'd be put to death, hussein told supporters. \" i knew then that i [ would ] be executed, leaving my dreams unfulfilled. \" her legal team has 15 days to file an appeal.

The punggye-ri site — which is couched in a mountain called mount mantap — apparently suffered a sizeable collapse in the hours and days after north korea's most recent nuclear test in september.

Seismologists have already shown that a big part of the site was unusable after the last test caused a near-immediate collapse of a cavity in mount mantap. The latest study used synthetic aperture radar — which is normally used to make 3d terrain maps — to show that mantap's slopes moved outward horizontally by nearly four yards, and the summit sank by about half a yard over the next week when \" damaged rock above the cavity slowly settled in on itself, \" says nature.

        "summary": "The word \" impeachment \" is getting tossed around a lot on capitol hill and on political talk shows these days, but politico takes note of a \" very strange \" twist: it's democrats who keep bringing it up, while republicans keep insisting they have no intention of going there. The thing is, democrats aren't just whispering about it — they're sending out red-alert emails with \" transparent glee, \" writes jonah goldberg at the los angeles times. The reason is simple: fundraising. \" we now have a shot at hitting our $ 2,000,000 goal to defend the president — and defeat boehner's republican house, \" reads one recent missive from the democratic congressional campaign committee. The strategy plays off republicans'decision to try to sue the white house over perceived abuses of executive privilege, but stretching that into an impeachment threat strikes goldberg as cynical politics from a president who constantly rails against, yes, cynicism in politics. The obama white house is again borrowing from the playbook of bill clinton, who actually benefited from an impeachment threat, he writes. \" the difference is that while clinton was hardly immune to the charge of cynicism, he wasn't trying to shut down the government or get impeached for narrow political advantage. \" click for goldberg's full column.",
