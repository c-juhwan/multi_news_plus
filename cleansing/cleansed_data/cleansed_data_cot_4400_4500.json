Well, that's one way of putting it: camping has now twice predicted a rapture that has twice failed to arrive. ( it's actually his third prediction: doomsday was first supposed to occur on sept. 6, 1994. ) \" why didn't christ return on oct. 21? it seems embarrassing for family radio, \" camping continues. \" but god was in charge of everything. We came to that conclusion after quite a careful study of the bible. \" camping goes on to basically admit he was wrong, albeit in very flowery language. ( \" we're ready to cry out and weep before god: ' oh lord, you have the truth, we don't have it. You have the truth. ' \" ) he also apologizes for saying that those who didn't believe in the original may 21 rapture date \" probably had not been saved. \" christian post notes that an explanation of why oct. 21 was the true doomsday date was scrubbed from the family radio website. And in a separate article last week, the christian post reported that the 90-year-old camping is, perhaps not surprisingly, retiring.",

According to the review-journal, a man named don schubert — who had previously called the newsroom to complain about the coin flips in the iowa caucus — came in and filled out an obituary form for clinton, giving the date of death as saturday, the day of the nevada democratic caucus. Security asked him to leave the building and contacted the secret service. He was seen driving away in a toyota prius \" bearing several bernie sanders campaign stickers. \" schubert later told the review-journal that the secret service had called him. He explained he was attempting \" political humor, \" with the obituary meant as a prediction of a clinton loss in the nevada caucus. He says the secret service told him they could — but likely would not — arrest him. Sanders ' website lists a \" don schubert's house \" in long beach, california, as the site of a volunteer phone bank. It seems there's just something about hillary clinton and obituaries, though.

Norway mass killer anders behring breivik was rejected by oslo university after applying for a place in its political science department. The university said the breivik, 34, lacked the qualifications to study at the institution, as he has not completed high school. \" the conclusion is that he isn't considered sufficiently qualified to start a course in political science, \" the rector of the university, ole petter ottersen, told agence france-presse. But breivik's lawyer, vibeke hein baera, said he has been studying in prison to meet the requirements to take courses at the norwegian university. \" he's collecting points to study at university. He studied mathematics this summer and will certainly study other material to reach the required level, \" said hein baera. More from globalpost: anders behring breivik applies to study politics at oslo university breivik himself has claimed to have spent 16,320 hours studying, something he sees as \" an informal education consisting of the equivalent of eight university years ( or equivalent to two bachelor degrees and one master degree ). \" news of his application to the oslo institution sparked outrage among staff, some of who said they were opposed to any dealings with breivik, who is serving a 21-year sentence for killing 77 people.

Breivik, who admitted killing 77 people in norway... ( associated press ) the university of oslo says it has rejected convicted mass killer anders behring breivik's application for admission to its political science program. University rector ole petter ottersen told the associated press in an email wednesday that the 34-year-old right-wing extremist has been informed \" that his qualifications do not suffice for admission to the bachelor program. \" breivik is serving a 21-year prison sentence, which can be extended when it expires, for killing 77 people in bomb and gun massacres two years ago. His university application stirred a debate in norway last week over whether someone convicted of such a horrific crime should even be considered for higher education. Prison officials said they had no reason to deny him the right to study in his cell if admitted by a university."

According to the ap, hudson allegedly returned to the campsite hours later and murdered all but one of the family members. The victims were identified as 46-year-old thomas kamp; his partner hannah johnson, 40; her 6-year-old son, kade; kamp's two adult sons, nathan and austin; and johnson's father, carl, 77. The family members were camping on property purchased by kamp in august and were celebrating nathan kamp's 24th birthday. Hudson lived next door. The daily sun reports the sole survivor is johnson's mother, cynthia, who ran into the woods and hid for hours before calling 911. \" apparently [ hudson ] did not see her run away, \" taylor says. \" thank god. \" two bodies found in the family's camper had been shot to death. The other four bodies were found in a pond. Hudson, identified by cynthia, was arrested at his mother's house nearby. The 33-year-old has a history of violence, but \" nothing like this, \" says taylor, who described the scene as \" like a war movie. \" while police haven't commented on motive, thomas kamp's ex-wife has a theory: carina kamp says the land purchase didn't go over well with hudson and suggests the murder was planned. Thomas kamp bought the land from hudson's father, who has since died, and hudson was reportedly angry that kamp locked the property to prevent access. She says kamp last weekend found that hudson had removed the lock and \" regained possession, \" as the palestine herald-press puts it.

At one point in the video, you can hear one of the kids yell, \"you're so fuckin poor you fat ass, \" in which karen responds, \"i try to live by some of these words, i try and it's really hard, \" referring to the words on her purse.

        "summary": "The insects are disappearing from an american rainforest — and scientists say the implications are frightening. A study published this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences found that there has been a staggering decline of biomass in puerto rico's el yunque rainforest over the last 35 years. Samples captured in sweeps carried out between 2011 and 2013 resulted in 4 to 8 times fewer insects and other arthropods than a previous expedition done in 1976-1977 — and sticky traps on the forest floor caught up to 60 times fewer creatures. The researchers say there have been parallel declines in the numbers of frogs, lizards, and birds that eat insects, signalling that life in the rainforest is dying out from the bottom up. \" this is one of the most disturbing articles i have ever read, \" university of connecticut invertebrate conservation expert david wagner tells the washington post. \" the gravity of their findings and ramifications for other animals, especially vertebrates, is hyperalarming, \" he says, calling the study a \" real wake-up call \" that the \" phenomenon could be much, much bigger, and across many more ecosystems. \" el yunque is well-protected as part of the us national forest system, and the study's researchers believe climate change — and increased exposure to extreme temperatures in particular — is the main cause of the steep decline in insects. The afp notes that between 1978 and 2015, the mean maximum temperatures recorded in the forest have climbed 2 degrees celsius ( 3.6 degrees fahrenheit ).

Jackson withdrew his nomination thursday after allegations by current and former colleagues raised questions about his prescribing practices and leadership ability, including accusations of drunkenness on the job. The office of montana sen. Jon tester, a democrat, collected the allegations, which included a claim that jackson \" got drunk and wrecked a government vehicle \" at a secret service going-away party. Internal records, including police reports, show jackson was in three minor vehicle incidents in government vehicles over the last five years, but none involved the use of alcohol and he wasn't found to be at fault. The white house medical unit jackson ran passed regular controlled substance audits and found no misconduct, per records for the last three years. Separately, the secret service said it has no evidence to support an allegation that its personnel intervened in a jackson disturbance overseas in 2015. As predicted by politico, president trump went after tester saturday morning. \" allegations made by senator jon tester against admiral/doctor ron jackson are proving false, \" he tweeted, adding the allegations \" have absolutely devastated the wonderful jackson family. Tester should resign. \" in a second tweet: \" the great people of montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral jackson is the kind of man that those in montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, tester! \"",

Complaints to the department of transportation about airline performance went up a whopping 28 percent in 2010, the study said. A precise cause for the spike in consumer disenchantment is hard to nail down, but it's most likely due to changes in the way airlines are doing business, said dean headley, co-author of the report, which is based on transportation department data. The number of air travelers is increasing, but there are fewer flights and fewer seats available. So flights are more crowded, and it's tougher to rebook when a flight is canceled. \" they are trying to match supply and demand _ the number of seats available to the number of people demanding seats _ a lot closer so they don't fly empty seats, which is expensive for the airlines, \" said headley, an associate professor of marketing at wichita state university's w.

The researchers also noted that the extinction of the shark coincided with the growth of baleen whales to their large size today. \" now we need to find out if one event — megalodon's extinction — caused the other — evolution of gigantism in whales, \" notes pimiento.

However, the time of extinction of this important species has never been quantitatively assessed. Here, we synthesize the most recent records of c. Megalodon from the literature and scientific collections and infer the date of its extinction by making a novel use of the optimal linear estimation ( ole ) model. Our results suggest that c. Megalodon went extinct around 2.6 ma. Furthermore,"

A new investigation by the gazette-mail reveals some harrowing background on how deaths like these may be facilitated. Over the 2007 to 2012 period, some 780 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills were shipped by drug wholesalers into the state — which has an estimated population of just 1.84 million, per the census bureau. That roughly works out to a per-person — children included — average allotment of 70 pain pills per year. Over that six-year period, 1,728 residents fatally overdosed on one of the two. The top three prescription drug wholesalers shipped 423 million of those pills to west virginia pharmacies, to their financial gain. Take, for instance, mckesson corp: it's not just no. 1 among wholesalers, but was no. 5 on the fortune 500 this year, behind the more-commonly-known walmart, exxon, apple, and berkshire hathaway. \" don't blame the middleman, \" is the story the gazette-mail heard: distributors say they only send to licensed pharmacies, which should only dole out pills when prescribed by a doctor. In a letter, mckesson argues \" [ those ] two roles that interface directly with the patient \" are better poised to stamp out abuse. The distributors are supposed to alert the state board of pharmacy when orders look suspicious, and yet the gazette-mail sussed out cases like the \" mom-and-pop pharmacy in oceana \" whose oxycodone delivery was 600 times greater than that of the rite aid eight blocks away. Head to the gazette-mail for the full piece, which also tracks how the potency of the pills sent is increasing.",

        "summary": "A mandatory weeklong curfew was imposed on baltimore after a day of chaos, violence, and looting yesterday. As fires continued to burn last night, including a huge one at a senior center under construction, mayor stephanie rawlings-blake announced the 10pm-to-5am curfew that will begin tonight, cnn reports. \" it's idiotic to think that by destroying your city, you're going to make life better for anybody, \" she said. A state of emergency has been declared, the national guard has been activated, and police say 1,500 state troopers were on the streets last night, the baltimore sun reports. In other developments: gov. Larry hogan says he is requesting another 5,000 law enforcement officers from neighboring states. National guard commander linda singh says they will be out in \" massive force, \" with up to 5,000 on the streets, but says the city will not be under martial law, the bbc reports. Last night's orioles game was called off, schools have canceled classes today, and many downtown employers, which closed early yesterday, plan to keep their doors shut today, the sun reports. At least two dozen people have been arrested and 15 police officers have been injured, six of whom are still hospitalized in serious condition, cbs baltimore reports. Police say the officers were hurt by flying debris, including cinder blocks. Us attorney general loretta lynch — hours after she was sworn in — slammed the \" senseless acts of violence \" and said the justice department \" stands ready to provide any assistance that might be helpful, \" cnn reports. Among buildings that were burned: a community center and under-construction apartments for seniors in east baltimore; the three-alarm blaze could be seen at a distance of several blocks, reports the sun. The sun describes rampant looting, conveying one scene in which men used a crowbar to open the trunk of a cop car as others took selfies on its roof. Still others looted a cvs and local grocery, leaving with garbage bags stuffed with \" diapers, bleach, snack foods, prescription drugs. \" one more detail from the sun: it reports the mayhem was preceded by a \" flier \" posted on social media that referenced a \" purge, \" a nod to a movie in which crime is legal for a day.",

Now, there are none — because kiah morris quit last month amid a rash of apparent vandalism, home invasions, and racially fueled threats. \" there were individuals in the community and throughout the state that we were finding were parts of white supremacist groups, \" she tells the bbc. Because vermont is considered so progressive, she says, \" we just sort of fell asleep and didn't pay attention to that. \" elected in 2014 to represent the town of bennington, morris abruptly scuttled her re-election campaign in august and quit altogether in september due to \" continued harassment \" and her husband's health issues, she wrote on facebook. Now she's divulging the details. Her family suffered home invasions and found swastikas painted on nearby trees, morris recently told the new york times. She also got a restraining order against an online harasser, but the threats kept coming. The 42-year-old chicago native says her support for gun control legislation — which beefed up background checks and banned bump stocks and large magazines when it passed in april — led to an intolerable level of threats and harassment. Colleagues and friends tried to stop her from quitting, and vermont's governor, republican phil scott, said he'd support her campaign because hate would win if she stepped down, but morris wasn't buying it. \" these are incredibly violent times, and i do not feel any need to martyr myself or my family, \" she says. \"... So i win because i chose to take my life back. \" ( meanwhile, a transgender candidate is making history in vermont. )",

            "Part of roger ailes ' master plan at fox news and grand design for american politics is to get as many potential republican candidates for president as he can on his payroll. Hence, sarah palin signed on yesterday as a fox contributor.ailes has several operations going here. He wants to be a kingmaker — actually, he believes he is a kingmaker. He believes that conservative candidates are successful when they take up the fox line ( not vice versa ) — and that they will be more successful if they follow his advice. He has, on several occasions, gotten in journalism-ethics trouble for seeming to advise conservative politicians. He solves that problem if they are his employees. He can be their personal political tutor; he's the director. Indeed, he's the boss. It should not be underestimated how good he is at this job. He can shape an incredible performance. And, finally, he wants to be paid for this. The tragedy of the political consultant, which ailes once was, working for nixon and reagan, is that consultants can never fully monetize their success. Ailes has solved that problem: he's turned conservative politics into a paying show.all this comprises an astounding development in american politics.but the even larger development is that ailes was fired on sunday. Matthew freud — the son-in-law",

State authorities say he was part of a program to protect journalists in high-risk areas, though he had not reported any recent threats against him. The journalist's widow, adelina mendoza, told local media that she had begged him to leave the profession and open a restaurant with her. She said her son was spared seeing the murder because she was leaving the party early and he left the room to say goodbye. \" i hugged him, i gave him a kiss because i was leaving, and right then i heard the gunshots. But i thought they were fireworks that some child had brought, \" she said, per the ap. \" god knows how to do things, because my son never saw his father die. \" other journalists in veracruz state say they are not being protected. \" it continues being the same nightmare, \" says miguel angel diaz, founder of the plumas libres news site. \" criminals have permission to do as they want. \"",

It's the first time since early may that romney has led in the poll, politico notes. And in 10 states politico deems competitive, romney is up 50 % to 48 %. In other election numbers: romney and the gop are also ahead on the cash front, by some $ 46 million, usa today reports. But the obama campaign has control over two-thirds of democratic campaign cash, whereas much of the republican money is in the party's hands rather than romney's. But with $ 2 billion raised between the two campaigns and their parties, neither candidate lacks the means for an intense last push. Indeed, romney held his final official fundraiser on saturday night, cnn notes. While politico sees president obama's lead among women shrinking, nate silver notes at fivethirtyeight that \" if only women voted, president obama would be on track for a landslide re-election. \" if men were the only voters, the election would be romney's. Polls show an average gender gap of 18 points, near the 20-point gap that set a record in 2000. Not much changed in the polls this weekend, silver adds. While obama saw gains in three daily tracking polls, he fell back in two. At the moment, he stands a 67.6 % chance of winning the election, according to the fivethirtyeight model this morning.

Having raised roughly $ 3 million in the month of may, he retained just $ 1.28 million in cash on hand -- a sum better suited for a competitive house race than a run for the presidency. Trump, naturally, attempted to placate the critics by saying he'd put in more of his own money if need be. But it's not just the poor nature of the incoming funding that has republicans worried. The way the presumptive gop nominee is spending his dwindling funds is drawing scrutiny as well. Documents show the trump campaign made four payments totaling $ 35,000 to a firm called draper sterling. The name alone was enough to turn heads. Any self-respecting \"mad men \" fan would recognize it as a cheap rip-off of the acclaimed show. But the firm trump is using for web advertising purposes isn't located on madison avenue. It's based in londonderry, new hampshire, on a pleasant residential street. It isn't even an office.

        "summary": "High gun ownership rates and high rates of mass shootings might seem like an obvious connection, but university of alabama researcher adam lankford says his study is the first to show empirical evidence that the aforementioned ownership rate \" is the strongest predictor of [ a country's ] number of public mass shooters. \" his quantitative analysis, based on 46 years of data on mass shootings around the world, found that the us has 5 % of the world's population but 31 % of its public mass shootings ( defined as the deaths of at least four people and excluding things like domestic incidents and fatalities during robberies ). The us has the highest civilian firearm ownership rate, and lankford says in a press release it's no coincidence that the other four in the top five — yemen, switzerland, finland, and serbia — are also in the top 15 for mass shootings. His study, which has not been published but was presented yesterday at the american sociological association's annual meeting, also found that more than 50 % of shooters in the us use more than one weapon; in fact, american mass shooters are 3.6 times more likely to use multiple weapons. But while american mass shooters kill an average 6.87 victims, abroad that number stands at 8.81, possibly because us police are better trained in dealing with mass shootings. Lankford says that the main lesson from the study is an obvious one: mass shootings can be reduced if the number of guns in circulation is reduced, as happened after a spate of shootings in australia. \" i didn't come into this study with any gun control agenda — i just let the data speak for itself, \" lankford tells deutsche welle. \" whether people are willing to act on it is another question. \"",

Some of that intolerability, per an undercover sunday times probe, includes workers being threatened with pink slips if they call in sick too often, a lack of available water ( despite some workers covering more than 10 miles per day in the warehouse ), and a claim that workers are getting injured because of pressure to meet targets. Amazon addressed its 12 uk fulfillment centers, and specifically the one with the tents, by noting it \" provides a safe and positive workplace with competitive pay and benefits from day one. \" all amazon workers ( permanent and temp ) currently start at $ 9.30 an hour and can make at least $ 14 an hour in overtime ( the uk's national living wage for people 25 and older is $ 9.10 an hour ).

A sampling: katrina vanden heuvel, the nation: \" going populist is now smart politics and good policy. The obama white house needs to show, quickly and forcefully, with concrete, bold and visible action, that it stands with the working people of america. \" obama can start by firing economic advisers responsible for the \" timid \" blueprint on wall street and unemployment.

Two weeks ago, brown was an obscure massachusetts legislator whose senate bid was widely believed to be little more than a visibility-raising warm-up before running for state treasurer later this year. Now brown – a republican who vows to stop healthcare reform and who denies that waterboarding is torture – has won the us senate seat held by ted kennedy from 1962 until his death last august. How bizarre is this? the last republican elected to the senate from massachusetts was ed brooke in 1972 – and brooke was a liberal african-american who defeated a conservative democrat.

Massachusetts supported obama by an overwhelming margin in the 2008 election. But brown's heavily-favoured democratic opponent, state attorney general martha coakley, lost even though obama travelled to boston on sunday to speak on her behalf.

More than anything, coakley's defeat should mark the end of obama's efforts to create a new, bipartisan political climate in washington. If he is to avoid the fate of bill clinton in the midterm elections of 1994, obama will need to embrace the populist anger now surging through the country rather than seeking to defuse it. Consider that obama's $ 787bn stimulus bill of last spring was heavily weighted toward tax cuts, against the advice of many economists, in an effort to win some republican support.

But researchers at mit say they've got new evidence showing that the 1,800-mile-wide region came not from beyond but from within, specifically from a volcanic eruption that unleashed a \" large plume of magma deep within the moon's interior. \" as the lava made its way to the surface and cooled, it created the dark spots we see today, reports the telegraph. In their study, researchers say one of the giveaways is that new data from nasa shows that the region's border is not actually round, but is instead \" rimmed by structures that run in straight lines and intersect at angles, similarly to a rectangle, \" explains nature. \" such a shape is hard to attribute to a collision, which would be expected to produce a more circular rim. \" definitive proof might not come unless astronauts return to the moon, but in the meantime, astronomy writer phil plait at slate thinks the theory makes sense. \" i've always had a problem with the impact idea, \" he writes, adding that the \" secondary effects \" that would have accompanied such a huge meteor strike don't appear to be evident.

        "summary": "India has racked up the most \" deaths by selfie, \" researchers say, and one forest ranger almost joined that statistic. Gulf news and the tribune report on a recent close call in the west bengal city of jalpaiguri, where ranger sanjoy dutta showed off to a crowd the 18-foot python he'd rescued, wrapping it around his neck and having admirers take pictures of him and the animal. Except the snake wasn't into the photo session, and became agitated and started to writhe, getting to the point where it actually started to strangle dutta. A video shows dutta repeatedly pushing the snake's body away from his throat, but at one point, as he walks away from the crowd, the snake gets even more serious about its efforts and starts to wrap around dutta's torso, per the independent. Witnesses can be heard screaming, but bystanders quickly helped unravel the snake from around dutta, who, oddly, doesn't seem too fazed by the incident. Others who viewed the video were disturbed, however, both by the fact that dutta could've been injured or killed, as well as by the treatment of the snake. \" 30 seconds of fame nearly cost the ranger's life. The animal was only reacting instinctively because it felt threatened, \" one twitter user commented. Another wrote: \" what a stupid show off. His job is to safeguard wild animals including snakes. \" the independent notes attacks on humans by reticulated pythons, which usually feast on small mammals, aren't common.

        "summary": "Those suffering from musophobia would be wise to steer clear of the south farallon islands. The archipelago, which sits just 27 miles off san francisco, is the most rodent-dense island in the world, with an average of 500 eurasian house mice occupying each of its 120 acres ( that's 60,000 total ). The only humans who have to deal with them are the scientists studying the otherwise uninhabited island's unique ecosystem — and things have gotten so bad that they say the ground often seems to be moving, and other species are being threatened. On friday, the fish &amp; wildlife service released a 650-page report that sums up its review of the 49 methods suggested for getting rid of the creatures, which are believed to have made their way to the islands via 19th-century seal-hunting vessels. It determined there are only two options: one, douse the island with rodenticides. Two, do nothing. Though other ideas included carting in feral cats, trapping, and sterilization, the fish &amp; wildlife service say that any method other than poison — which would entail food pellets treated with one of two anticoagulants being dropped on the island, ultimately causing the mice to bleed to death — would have too great an effect on the ecosystem. But the effort wouldn't be as simple as just dropping and waiting, explains the sf chronicle: peregrine falcons and burrowing owls would have to be captured and held elsewhere; methods would have to be put in place to deter sea gulls. And while mice have been wiped from more than 50 islands around the globe using rodenticides, animal rights groups are staunchly opposed, and note that in the aforementioned cases, other species also perished; ktvu also notes that products made with one of the poisons under consideration were banned from sale this year by the epa because they are so toxic to animals. But biologists say that even with those casualties, the ecosystems have bounced back. A decision is expected by year-end.

Nearly 36 million people around the world ( more than ever before ) are slaves, according to the walk free foundation's global slavery index, which includes victims of forced labor, human trafficking, forced marriage, and debt bondage, the smithsonian reports. With 4 % of the population in slavery, mauritania has the highest percentage of its population in bondage. The country only outlawed slavery in 2007, but hereditary slavery continues to this day. The foundation says its slave estimate has soared from 30 million last year because of better methodology, reports the bbc. The group's report found that india has the highest number of slaves — more than 14 million — but some form of slavery exists in all 167 countries on the index, including the us. \" we are all responsible for the most appalling situations where modern slavery exists and the desperate misery it brings upon our fellow human beings, \" the foundation's chairman tells the guardian. \" the first step in eradicating slavery is to measure it. And with that critical information, we must all come together — governments, businesses, and civil society — to finally bring an end to the most severe form of exploitation. \" ( last year, new hampshire finally freed 14 slaves. )",

Kelly, in an unexpected and emotional appearance in the white house briefing room, invoked the death of his own son, killed in afghanistan in 2010, as he lashed out at rep.

Kelly, speaking slowly and forcefully, said he was \" heartbroken \" that wilson overheard the conversation and used it to attack the president. He also confirmed then-president obama didn't call him after his son's death, but emphasized that wasn't a criticism since not all presidents make phone calls. Kelly absolved trump of blame, suggesting that the president did the best he could in one of the most challenging aspects of his job, and noted that he advised the president against making the call since \" there's no perfect way \" to do it. He also attempted to explain trump's words, per politico: \" [ johnson ] knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted.... He enlisted, and he was where he wanted to be, exactly where he wanted to be with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken. That was the message. \" a spokeswoman told the ap wilson stood by her earlier comments. The congresswoman herself, asked by wsvn-tv in florida about kelly's remarks, replied only indirectly. \" let me tell you what my mother told me when i was little, \" wilson said. \" she said,'the dog can bark at the moon all night long, but it doesn't become an issue until the moon barks back.

        "summary": "A surprising turn of events this week has focused attention on the former soviet state of armenia: there, longtime leader serzh sargsyan abruptly resigned on monday amid protests accusing him of a blatant power grab. \" i was wrong, \" sargsyan, an ally of vladimir putin, told the nation. As the bbc explains, sargsyan had served as armenia's president from 2008 until term limits forced him from the post this month. His solution? he took advantage of a referendum back in 2015 that transferred most power from the president to a prime minister — a vote critics say sargsyan himself engineered so he could remain in control by switching offices when his presidential term ended, drawing parallels to putin. Sure enough, as soon as his term wrapped up, the parliament voted him into the prime minister's post with no opposition, reports the new york times. \" the way that they proceeded was so arrogant that it triggered a rather intense reaction that nobody expected, \" says the head of an armenian think tank. Protesters took to the streets for days, and things came to a head sunday after sargsyan walked out of televised talks with opposition leader nikol pashinyan when pashinyan demanded his resignation. Pashinyan was detained, and protests intensified — and they likely would have gotten worse tuesday, when the nation marks the genocide of 1.5 million armenians at the hands of ottoman turks. Perhaps to ward that off, sargsyan stepped down, saying that pashinyan \" was right. \" a sargsyan ally has assumed the prime minister's post for now. A washington post editorial sees all this as bad news for putin, along with \" the thuggish, corruption-ridden, and economically failed model that is putinism. \"",

        "summary": "There's usually a significant increase, of up to 20 %, each january to february in the apprehension of illegal immigrants crossing over into the states from mexico. But this year, a surprising development, the bbc reports: based on figures released by customs and border protection, january's number of 31,578 plummeted to 18,762 in february — an \" unprecedented \" 40 % decrease. Homeland security chief john kelly attributes this \" change in trends \" to the new inhabitant of the oval office, linking the \" dramatic drop \" to president trump's executive orders designed to deal directly with immigration. Kelly also notes it's \" encouraging news \" for the immigrants themselves, since the numbers suggest fewer people are putting their lives at risk of \" exploitation, assault, and injury \" at the hands of human smugglers, as well as hardship from the perilous trip itself. Cnn confirms the upending of a nearly two-decade trend of higher february apprehension numbers, citing cbp data back to 2000. However, critics say this just means that the new mandates have targeted vulnerable populations like women and children and scared them off from even attempting to gain entry. \" the bullies can gloat and preen that they chased the skinny kids off the block, \" says leon rodriguez, who used to run the us citizenship and immigration services office under former president obama. That fear is extending up to our northern border as well, with the washington post reporting on \" mounting numbers \" of migrants fleeing to canada, braving even blizzard conditions to seek asylum outside the us. \" they ' ll take whatever risk, \" says the director of minnesota's confederation of somali community.

In 2014, the un's commission of inquiry deemed the entire prison system there a \" crime against humanity. \" the new images show standard prison-camp environs: guard towers, barbed-wire fences, even rock quarries where prisoners are forced to crush limestone. Report author david hawk notes \" a lot of the people in these prisons are there for crimes that would not be crimes in another country, \" like making too much money on the stock market. In addition to the photos, hawk's report includes years of testimony he gathered from those who've lived through the prison camp experience and then fled north korea. And that experience sounds brutal, including hard labor in dangerous conditions, torture, and \" inadequate \" food supplies, resulting in a \" dreadfully large numbers \" of deaths, per hawk.

        "summary": "Security cameras around manhattan captured the final hours of judge sheila abdus-salaam's life as authorities continue trying to piece together what happened to the first african-american woman to sit on the new york court of appeals, the los angeles times reports. Prior to the discovery of the videos, the last sighting of abdus-salaam, who was found dead in the hudson river april 12, was at 10am april 11, according to the new york daily news. She had told her assistant she was sick and not coming into work. The videos show her walking quickly alone in sweats and sneakers — by all appearances she could be exercising. The new york times reports the videos show abdus-salaam walking for hours in riverbank state park. The last video is her standing by the water's edge shortly after midnight april 12. While police have labeled abdus-salaam's death suspicious, they still believe it's most likely she killed herself, saying she was possibly depressed or distraught about the deaths of her mother and brother, which occurred around the easter holiday in recent years. But abdus-salaam's husband says she wasn't suicidal and wouldn't have killed herself. And while signs point to the 65-year-old judge being alive when she went into the hudson river, she did have bruises on her neck. Authorities say she may have been choked in the hours or days before she died. However, it's possible the bruises were created when her body was removed from the river. The medical examiner's office still hasn't issued a cause of death.",

Grays harbor county sheriff rick scott said thursday that the girl's body was found by hunters in eastern washington last fall, but confirmation of the identity only came back from the fbi crime lab recently. \" we've brought lindsey home. We've recovered her, \" he said. Lindsey's mom reported her missing 30 minutes after she was supposed to get home, but a huge search effort in the following days found no trace of her. Lindsey's parents are \" understandably devastated, \" said scott, who promised investigators would stay involved with the case \" until we bring the monster that's responsible for this and hold them accountable. \" \" the prayers and hopes of the family were that we would some day find her alive and bring her home. Now, the reality is we need to find a homicide suspect, \" he said, per the seattle times. The sheriff firmly declined to answer questions on the cause of death, the location of the body, and potential suspects, saying he needed to protect the integrity of the investigation, reports the chinook observer. \" a monster is still out there, \" said grays harbor county commissioner vickie raines. \" it is a very sad day, certainly not the outcome we've been hoping for. \"",

        "summary": "Twitter doesn't much like president obama. But then, it likes mitt romney even less. Or at least, that's what the numbers appear to indicate on the new \" twitter political index \" ( or \" twindex \" for short ). Twitter launched the index today, claiming that it provides an accurate snapshot of the aggregate political sentiment of all 400 million tweets sent every day, usa today reports. Its development partner, topsy labs, claims the software can even detect things like sarcasm and humor as it pours over the \" firehose \" of tweets. It's unclear how accurate that claim is, but \" anybody who's really interested in understanding political dynamics is going to be interested, \" says one democratic pollster who helped with the project. The index ranks politicians on a scale of zero to 100, with 50 as neutral. Both candidates have languished almost entirely below 50 — obama was at 34 today and romney at 25 — and so far twitter hasn't shown an obvious bias for either candidate. \" we were surprised, \" says one republican pollster. \" it's not a super democratic skew. \"",
