He didn't reveal any more about cole, but gawker has obtained a draft of the finding your roots script where affleck is informed that, according to the 1850 census, cole, a prominent citizen of savannah, owned 25 slaves, which put him in the top 10 % of slaveholders. \" god.

        "summary": "An all-corn diet can quite literally turn a female hamster into a cannibal. A new study found that the european hamster, which once used to feast on a varied diet of grains, roots, and insects, is not doing so well on a diet limited to industrially grown corn. Indeed, the study, published in the proceedings of the royal society of london b, notes that the hamster species is \" on the verge of extinction in western europe. \" the all-maize regimen has turned the burrowing critters into \" deranged cannibals \" that eat their own offspring, the afp reports. Scientists in northeastern france stumbled on the discovery while studying whether diet affects hamsters ' ability to reproduce in the wild. They fed a set of hamsters wheat or corn-based diets, each mixed with worms and clover. Roughly equal numbers of pups were born to mothers fed either diet. But while 80 % of pups whose moms ate a wheat-based diet lived to be weaned, only 5 % of those fed a corn-based diet made it that far. \" females stored their pups with their hoards of maize before eating them, \" say the scientists, who noted other unusual behaviors, like the mothers running in circles. The researchers suspected a lack of vitamin b3 ( niacin ) was to blame, and confirmed it by again feeding the hamsters corn-based diets, but adding b3 for one group; these mothers didn't consume their young. Vitamin b3 deficiency has been linked to unpleasant conditions in dogs ( black-tongue syndrome ) and humans ( \" from 1735 to 1940, maize-based diets led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people from pellagra, \" per the researchers ).

        "summary": "Talk about a grim anniversary: countess elizabeth bathory of the kingdom of hungary died 400 years ago, ending the world's \" most prolific \" recorded killing spree by a woman, cnn reports. Bathory reportedly tortured and killed up to 650 girls and bathed in their blood because she believed it kept her looking young ( ergo her nickname, the \" blood countess \" ). She settled in modern-day slovakia after her husband died in 1604, and increased her killing rate to the point where she coaxed even high-born girls to the cellar of her manor house. By 1610, the hungarian king heard rumors of her deeds and sent a high-level official to investigate. Bathory and her three servant accomplices were arrested later that year. The servants were tortured and burned alive, while bathory was forced to live within the walls of cachtice castle until her death on august 21, 1614. Today the castle ruin is open to visitors, and a local wine co-op stores barrels in her notorious manor cellar. One of the co-op's labels — \" bathory blood \" — was discontinued four years ago, but came back this year under customer pressure ( \" it's ruby red, of course, \" cnn notes ). Bathory's crimes have also inspired films and books, possibly including bram stoker's novel dracula. So how do locals feel about all this? \" the older generation seems ashamed of her, \" says an 18-year-old. \" there were some protests when bathory's statue was erected in the square, \" but for young people \" she is not important. \" in modern mass-murderer news, the guardian reports that ander breivik's father has written a book called my fault? a father's story in which he questions his responsibility in his son's murder of 77 people in oslo, norway, in 2011.

The acting solicitor general has urged the supreme court to set aside a ruling from an appellate court allowing an oregon man claiming abuse by a priest in the 60s to sue the holy see, the wall street journal reports. The white house brief argued that the lower court had misapplied the law setting out the standards under which foreign governments can be sued. Exceptions to sovereign immunity ought to be narrowly construed, the brief argued, not expanded to the extent they were in this case, explains the national catholic reporter. \"improperly subjecting a foreign state to suit can in some circumstances raise foreign relations and reciprocity concerns, \" the brief notes. The man's lawyer says he is \" perplexed \" by the brief — which the supreme court isn't required to follow — but he's heartened that the solicitor general recommended sending it back to the appellate court for reconsideration, not dismissing the case altogether.",

        "summary": "\" i welcome any opportunity to have a real conversation with the president \" on immigration, said sen. Robert menendez on friday. The real sen. Robert menendez. A comedian pretending to be the new jersey democrat's assistant tried to place a call to president trump on wednesday and says he ultimately got through. Now the white house is \" scrambling \" to figure out how it happened, as politico puts it. It reports john melendez, nicknamed stuttering john and a regular on howard stern's radio show, donned a british accent, said his name was sean moore ( an amalgamation of james bond actors sean connery and roger moore ) and phoned the white house switchboard on menendez's behalf. He was told the president was in north dakota to give a speech. Melendez was insistent. The new york times has the subsequent play-by-play, which apparently included the white house operator phoning melendez to \" confirm \" his identity and inquire why he was calling from a california area code ( vacation, he said ). Melendez says jared kushner subsequently called him to arrange a time and discuss the topic at hand, and that he was ultimately connected to the president, who was aboard air force one. This six-minute recording, which the white house hasn't verified as authentic, resulted. The call touched on immigration and anthony kennedy's supreme court seat. \" donald picks up the phone and i started talking to the president. I never said to donald that i was sen. Menendez. I was just talking in my long island accent, \" melendez tells cnn. \" i just could not believe that it took us an hour and a half to get jared kushner and donald trump on the phone. \"",

        "summary": "There are plenty of people who might benefit from intentionally forgetting certain memories — those who've been in combat, or suffered some form of abuse, for instance, and consequently struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder. Now researchers at dartmouth report in the journal psychonomic bulletin &amp; review that they've figured out a way to help people do that through \" contextually mediated intentional forgetting. \" in less academic jargon: if we want to forget certain memories, we should try to clear our minds of the context related to them. \" it's like intentionally pushing thoughts of your grandmother's cooking out of your mind if you don't want to think about your grandmother at that moment, \" says lead author jeremy manning in a press release. \" we were able to physically measure and quantify that process using brain data. \" in their brain imaging study of 25 participants ages 19 to 34, researchers found that if they alternated images of words and outdoor scenes — think forests or beaches — and then asked participants to try to forget those words, people tried to \" flush out \" thoughts related to the images. Those who most successfully pushed those images out of mind recalled the fewest number of words. So to forget an awkward conversation, manning tells live science we should try to forget other things that happened in the background as it took place: the song playing, for instance, perhaps by thinking of another song. As manning puts it, \" if you don't want to think of the color blue, you think of green things instead. \" ( in other news, memories lost to dementia may be retrievable. )",

Mikhail lesin, the former kremlin press minister who helped set up russia today and spent more than a year as chief of the powerful gazprom-media group, was found dead in the dupont circle hotel in november. Russian media reported at the time that the 57-year-old heavy smoker and drinker had died from a heart attack, but the dc medical examiner's office announced on thursday that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, the guardian reports. Police haven't said whether they suspect a crime was committed, though it's not clear what else would explain the blunt force injuries to the russian's head, neck, torso, arms, and legs. Moscow says it's seeking \" clarification from washington and relevant official data on the progress of the investigation, \" reports the bbc, which notes that some us lawmakers had been calling for an investigation into lesin and the vast fortune he amassed while working as a civil servant in russia, including $ 28 million in los angeles real estate.",

The bomb detonated at a security checkpoint between the embassy and the baath party headquarters, the bbc reports. Activists say at least 31 people were killed — mostly civilians, according to sky news. Syrian state television said about 57 cars had been damaged in the explosion, which created a five-foot crater in the road. Meanwhile, the ap reports that 18 people have been killed in a government airstrike on a field hospital in daraa. The damascus blast \" was huge. Everything in the shop turned upside down, \" says one resident who witnessed a young girl being killed by flying glass. \" i pulled her inside the shop, but she was almost gone. \" it was the first of four explosions to hit damascus today, but is especially notable because the central city has been relatively insulated from such attacks, reuters reports. Meanwhile, on the war's diplomatic front: russia's foreign minister and the arab league's general secretary are urging the sides to create a unified transitional government. \" neither side can allow itself to rely on a military solution, \" russia's sergei lavrov said, \" because it is a road to nowhere. \" but a senior syrian national coalition official said bashar al-assad and his inner circle \" must go first, \" adding, \" after that we can discuss with others in the regime who didn't share in the killing of our people. \" but a draft rebel communiqué indicates they are willing to drop their demand that assad depart as a precondition for talks. Britain's foreign secretary today said that opposition chief mouaz al-khatib had made a \" very important offer of negotiation, \" and urged the regime to respond \" with serious negotiations, \" the afp reports.",

        "summary": "American cheese has been a staple in us kitchens for decades, but bloomberg reports that its fortunes appear to be heading south. The story also sees one big reason why: millennials aren't interested in buying or eating the processed stuff, preferring instead natural cheeses that taste more distinctive even if they are pricier. Chains such as wendy's, cracker barrel, and panera bread are either ditching american cheese — a champion melter — or at least offering alternatives. It's \" an ingredient we're looking to less and less in our pantry, \" says panera exec sara burnett of american cheese. The story finds even more evidence in economic stats, including one that notes us sales of processed cheese are on track to dip for the fourth consecutive year. Prices for american cheese are down, too, and the number of specialty cheesemakers is surging. A solid 40 % of us households still buy kraft singles, but sales are flat, a company exec tells bloomberg, whose story traces the cheese's origins back to wwii. Need an impassioned defense of the stuff? see dave holmes at esquire. \" what is american cheese? i don't know, and i don't want to, \" he writes. \" it's made of secret chemicals, yumminess compounds, and can-do spirit. \" ( bloomberg is less romantic, ticking off ingredients such as sodium citrate, calcium phosphate, natamycin, and modified food starch. ) \" i appreciate your ambitious four-cheese blends, \" holmes tells foodies, \" but if you're going to make me a grilled cheese, save your blending time and unwrap me four slices of kraft. \"",

            "Listen to article 5: 38 american cheese will never die. It has too many preservatives. But it's melting away. One by one, america's food outlets are abandoning the century-old american staple. In many cases, they're replacing it with fancier cheeses. Panera four cheese grilled cheese source: panera bread wendy's is offering asiago. A&w's canada locations switched to real cheddar. Mcdonald's is selling the big mac's soft, orange square of american cheese with a version that doesn't contain artificial preservatives. Cracker barrel ditched its old-fashioned grilled cheese. So did panera bread, replacing american with a four-cheese combo of fontina, cheddar, monteau and smoked gouda. The result: higher sales. American cheese is \"an ingredient we're looking to less and less in our pantry, \" said sara burnett, the chain's director of wellness and food policy. Cultural crossroads american ( cheese ) culture is at a crossroads. The product, made famous by the greatest generation, devoured by boomers on the go and touted as the basis for macaroni and cheese, the well-documented love object of gen x, has met its match with millennials demanding nourishment from ingredients that are both recognizable and pronounceable.

            "Listen to article 5: 38 american cheese will never die. It has too many preservatives. But it's melting away. One by one, america's food outlets are abandoning the century-old american staple. In many cases, they're replacing it with fancier cheeses. Panera four cheese grilled cheese source: panera bread wendy's is offering asiago. A&w's canada locations switched to real cheddar. Mcdonald's is selling the big mac's soft, orange square of american cheese with a version that doesn't contain artificial preservatives. Cracker barrel ditched its old-fashioned grilled cheese. So did panera bread, replacing american with a four-cheese combo of fontina, cheddar, monteau and smoked gouda. The result: higher sales. American cheese is \"an ingredient we're looking to less and less in our pantry, \" said sara burnett, the chain's director of wellness and food policy. Cultural crossroads american ( cheese ) culture is at a crossroads. The product, made famous by the greatest generation, devoured by boomers on the go and touted as the basis for macaroni and cheese, the well-documented love object of gen x, has met its match with millennials demanding nourishment from ingredients that are both recognizable and pronounceable.

Instead of looking through actual windows, passengers in the first-class cabin of emirates ' newest boeing 777-300er aircraft will view the outside via images projected by fiber-optic cameras outside the plane, reports digitaltrends. Think, virtual windows. The airline hopes to eventually roll out virtual windows in all sections of the plane, arguing that windowless planes are lighter, and thus burn less fuel, as well as more structurally sound. Not everyone is excited about the idea, however. One safety expert is concerned about safety issues. \" flight attendants would need to check outside the aircraft in an emergency, for example for fire, before opening a door and commencing an evacuation, \" one such expert tells the bbc. \"anything that needed power to do this may not be easy to get certified by an aviation safety regulator. \" the bigger problem might be passenger squeamishness about the concept. \" an aircraft could be very claustrophobic and for many, air travel is anxiety inducing already, \" observes the bbc expert. Other companies have been moving in the opposite direction, notes cnn. Boeing's dreamliner features large windows; airbus introduced a cabin with transparent walls back in 2011, and jet manufacturer embraer has an aircraft with large panoramic windows.

        "summary": "The last time the supreme court heard a design patent case, it involved carpets — and there were only 38 states in the usa. The long-running apple vs. Samsung battle over the latter company's alleged copying of iphone design elements made it to the country's top court tuesday, and the wall street journal reports that the court seemed \" frustrated \" by its first such case since 1885 as the justices tried to figure out how much individual design features like the iphone's round corners and app grid could be worth. A roundup of coverage: samsung argues that it shouldn't have to turn over all its profits on products that infringed on apple patents, and reuters reports that the justices struggled with the question of how lower courts should assess design patent damages. \" if i were a juror, i wouldn't know what to do, \" justice anthony kennedy said. The case revolves around how the phone looks, not how it works, and justice elena kagan used the example of the shape of the vw beetle. Tech times notes that the case is being very closely watched by the tech industry, with google, hp, dell, and other major firms supporting samsung, and a coalition of designers backing apple. Cnet takes a look at the background of the case, and at how the court's decision could end up affecting the gadgets that you buy. A patent \" on the portion of the appearance of a phone should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the profit on the entire phone, \" said a samsung lawyer, per the journal. Apple's chief litigation officer countered that it would pose \" chilling risks to the future of design innovation \" if samsung got away with copying the iphone. The bbc looks at the 1885 case, in which companies that accused the dobson brothers of ripping off their carpet designs were awarded 6 cents each, and at how it affects the apple vs. Samsung case, where a ruling is due by june 2017.",

        "summary": "New studies released friday offer the strongest indication yet that the zika virus is responsible for the dramatic increase in microcephaly in brazil while simultaneously warning that condition could be just the tip of the iceberg for infected babies. Researchers working at three us colleges determined zika specifically targets cells that will develop into brain cells, according to their study. Using stem cells, they found zika infected up to 90 % of neural progenitor cells, killing one-third of them, in a process that would have \" devastating results \" to a developing brain, the bbc reports. Neural progenitor cells go on to form the brain's cortex — the exact same part of the brain that is shrunken in microcephaly cases. While the new study doesn't prove zika causes microcephaly, it strengthens that theory by showing that the virus can severely damage the brain, the washington post reports. \" we're literally the first people in the world to know this, to know that this virus can infect these very important cells and interfere with their function, \" says the study's lead author. Meanwhile, another study out of brazil shows zika may be connected to even more \" grave outcomes \" for babies than previously known, according to the ap. \" it's much more than microcephaly, \" one doctor says. Ultrasounds on dozens of zika-infected women showed abnormalities in 29 % of their fetuses. Those abnormalities included growth issues, problems with the placenta, and even death.",

        "summary": "If you have a bad year financially, you should see some of your tax burden lifted. That's just good tax policy, argues megan mcardle at bloomberg. But very few of us will ever have a year as bad as donald trump's year in 1995, when leaked tax records reported by the new york times show that he lost nearly $ 1 billion — a loss he was, quite legally, able to parlay into avoiding paying federal taxes for up to 18 years. There really isn't much new here, mcardle argues, since voters already knew trump lost huge sums of money in failed atlantic city ventures. It's also unlikely trump was able to use shady tricks to negotiate down his tax debt, since a $ 915 million dollar loss was bound to attract heavy irs scrutiny. Further, trump actually had every right to claim the net operating loss that let him leverage his disastrous 1995 against years that were more bountiful, writes mcardle. Take her example of a business that loses $ 1 million one year and makes $ 1.5 million the next: \" without the ability to carry forward the losses from year one, then over the two years, it would pay perhaps $ 600,000 worth of state and federal income taxes, on $ 500,000 worth of actual money that it could spend to pay those taxes. \" and yes, trump did save a ton of money in taxes through that one very bad year, she writes. \" but astute readers will have noticed that it is not actually smart financial strategy to lose $ 900 million in order to get out of paying $ 315 million to the irs. Most of us would rather have the other $ 585 million than a tax bill of $ 0. \" bad business, sure. Tax dodge? no way. Her full column is here.",

The mystery deepened on friday, at which point more than 24 hours had elapsed since the flight crashed into the mediterranean sea with 66 people on board and no one had claimed responsibility, reports reuters. The latest developments: egyptian authorities say they've spotted a body part, two seats, and suitcases from the plane, reports ap. Earlier reports on the discovery of wreckage turned out to be inaccurate. Egypt says a terrorist attack is more likely the cause than a mechanical problem, but french foreign minister jean-marc ayrault says there is still \" absolutely no indication \" why the paris-to-cairo flight came down, the bbc reports. French investigators are looking at whether security at paris ' charles de gaulle airport could have been breached, although security breaches at airports with looser security are also a strong possibility, the new york times notes. In the 24 hours before going to paris, the airbus a320 flew round trips between cairo and asmara, eritrea, and between cairo and tunis. Egyptian president abdel fattah al-sisi expressed his \" utmost sadness and regret \" in an official statement. Greece's chief air accident investigator tells the guardian that while the investigation can't fully begin until the black boxes are found, weather can be ruled out as a cause. The three reasons for plane crashes are \" meteorological, technical, and human, \" he says. \" the first has now been ruled out because the weather was quite good. Whether a technical factor or human factor, either inside or outside the plane, is to blame remains to be seen. All possibilities are open. \"",

Keith davis, reported to be 41 or 42, was monitoring the panama-registered victoria no. 168, ensuring the crew was sticking to international fishing guidelines, when he disappeared sept. 10 as the boat cruised about 500 miles off the peruvian coast. Now the fbi and us coast guard are involved in the investigation, which has few details to offer so far. \" he's just gone, \" the director of the coast guard's investigative service tells cnn. Crew members have said they noticed davis, who had been on the boat about three weeks, was missing when they sought him out to approve a fish transfer. But his relatives are doubting this story, especially considering the experience of other such observers: cnn notes that they aren't fishermen's favorite people, mainly because they report violations to the authorities. That leads to observers being threatened and even assaulted — \" every observer who has been doing it for very long has a story, \" an industry rep tells cnn — and one of davis ' family members tells wcvb that davis had emailed his dad and said he was \" uncomfortable \" on the victoria. Even more chilling: a video on a closed facebook page dedicated to davis that shows him singing about other observers who've gone missing at sea. A post by a relative notes that davis'dad says his son's belongings were seized by the panamanians and that us officials have not been allowed to interview a \" person of interest, \" raw story reports. \" it would be irresponsible of me to call this a ' coverup ' of sorts however i am at a loss to call it otherwise, \" the post reads.",

            "Scenario: as a foreign correspondent on assignment in afghanistan, you successfully contact taliban representatives who take you to meet a mullah. After you've completed your interview and fact-finding mission, u.s. Officials arrest you under suspicion of terrorism. How: section 1021 ( 2 ) of the national defense authorization act grants power to indefinitely detain \" a person who was a part of or substantially supported al-qaeda, the taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the united states or its coalition partners. \" you're not sure if what you did was \" substantial \" or really \" supported \" anyone. It's quite possible that nobody does, as the text of the law doesn't define these words. This could take a while to sort out. In the recent hearing on a lawsuit challenging that section of the act, judge katherine forrest asked an obama lawyer if plaintiff chris hedges could be assured that he would not be subjected to detention under section 1021, journalist naomi wolf noted. Hedges is a pulitzer prize-winning reporter who has worked extensively in afghanistan and the middle east. The administration attorney suggested that the specifics of hedge's situation would make his detention unlikely, but responded, \" i cannot say that today. \" while the obama administration has said you're entitled to a trial as a u.s. Citizen, this won't preclude you from a protracted journey through an encumbered court system charged with figuring out -- based on secret evidence -- why you were picked up.

This is north korea, and it's not every day two outsiders are allowed on an extensive, week-long road trip through the country en route to the revered mountain, near the border with china. And yet, talmadge was one of two american journalists who got that chance — albeit on north korea's terms — touching nearly 10 % of north korea's 15,000 miles of road in an effort to explore north korean tourism \" in its infancy. \" after all, \" when north korea opens its doors, it does so for a reason, \" writes talmadge. In this case, it was to promote north korea's planned special foreign investment and tourism zones. The focus was mount paektu, the home of the north korean revolution where \" secret camp \" reconstructions dot the scene and guides dress in period costume. Talmadge and a photographer were babysat the entire way by a \" minder \" who monitored their movements; they couldn't speak to anyone without permission and photos of checkpoints or military installations were a no-no. But it wasn't entirely boring. There was a sticky situation in which they were caught heading the wrong way down a one-way road. Overall, though, it was smooth sailing. Meanwhile, north korea will begin banning tourists tomorrow over ebola fears, the guardian reports. ( the country also just released an american detainee. )",

The baby's father, matt rider, was driving sarah iler from cape girardeau to poplar bluff on wednesday when a tractor trailer slammed into their suv and pushed it into the median. Ejected from the vehicle, iler received cpr from responding officers but was declared dead upon arrival at a cape girardeau hospital. That's when doctors performed an emergency cesarean section to save her daughter, who came into the world full-term at just 4 pounds, 15 ounces, and was temporarily put on a ventilator. Maddyson took hold of a nurse's finger and opened her eyes when she was born, says kasandra iler, the mom's sister, but doctors can't say whether the lack of oxygen after her mom's death gave the newborn brain damage. Rider, who was estranged from iler and recently reconciled, was also ejected from the suv and underwent several surgeries after a few ribs and all his limbs were broken, the southeast missourian reports. Like his new daughter, rider is in fair condition. Now the family, which has little money, has started a gofundme account to pay for iler's funeral as they grapple with the loss. \" the thought never once entered my head that that baby might die, \" says kasandra. \" i felt my sister gave her life to save this baby.

Mullah abdul rauf was killed yesterday in helmand province in a strike that tribal elders say hit a car traveling across the desert and killed around six people, the bbc reports. Rauf — who was captured by us forces in 2001 and spent six years in guantanamo bay before escaping from house arrest in kabul — is believed to have become a recruiter for isis after falling out with taliban leaders last month, according to the bbc, which notes that this was one of the first strikes under nato's new mandate in afghanistan. Even before rauf changed sides, there were reports of groups of afghan fighters trading the taliban's white flag for the black one of isis, though it's not clear how big a foothold the group has gained in the country. \" in the context of an insurgency that kills thousands of afghan national security forces every year, scattered reports about a few people in the mountains wearing black is not an immediate concern, \" an analyst in afghanistan with international crisis group tells the guardian, though he adds that rumors of leader mullah omar's death have deepened rifts within the taliban — and there are suspicions about whether the group gave away rauf's location to nato.",

Oskar gröning was 96 when he died friday at a hospital in germany, the guardian reports. As a guard in the nazi ss, gröning's job involved keeping track of the money and valuables that were taken from prisoners and sent back to berlin and, at times, he was assigned to process prisoners as they entered auschwitz. In 2015, gröning became one of the last former members of the nazi regime to be tried for his crimes. Per the ap, gröning testified that he witnessed individual atrocities, but never acknowledged participating in any crimes. However, at trial he acknowledged he was \" morally complicit in the murder of millions of jews. \" gröning was found guilty and sentenced to four years in prison and court doctors determined he was fit to serve out his sentence. That never happened, however. After a series of appeals were rejected, a german court ruled in december that gröning must start his sentence soon. As recently as this month, a \" request for mercy \" had been filed on gröning's behalf, but had gone unanswered by the time his death was reported.",

        "summary": "It's been a tense week in hollywood, as tv networks announce which shows have been canceled, which have been renewed, and which pilots have been picked up for next season. Now the results are ( mostly ) in. Did your favorite survive the chopping block? zap2it has been keeping score. Some talking points: nbc is losing a lot of half-hour sitcoms. In addition to the end of 30 rock and the office, it has axed the new normal, 1600 penn, guys with kids, up all night and whitney. Amazingly, it has renewed the embattled community — and deadline speculates it may attempt to bring back famously ousted showrunner dan harmon. To the surprise of no one, smash is also out at nbc. More surprising: it has also nixed rock center, reports the new york times. Abc has picked up perhaps the most hyped pilot of the season, the awkwardly titled marvel's agents of s.h.i.e.l.d, co-created by avengers writer/director and cult favorite joss whedon, says the la times. Cbs has canned csi: new york along with long-running comedy rules of engagement. It has picked up four new comedy pilots, but not the buzzed-about beverly hills cop tv sequel it was expected to take, reports the hollywood reporter.

        "summary": "A mostly pit-bull line-up of gop candidates mixed it up tonight in the final debate before the iowa caucuses. Their performance could well decide their success or failure in the key state. Rivals and moderators put barely-front-runner newt gingrich in the hot seat, and his response was to be more rambunctious than ever. Some highlights: the biggest applause of the night follows gingrich's threat to strip federal judges of their power if he becomes president because the courts are \" grotesquely \" dictatorial. The judiciary is \" far too powerful and arrogant in their misreading of the american people, \" he says. Michele bachmann agrees, but a slightly stunned ron paul responds that a president stripping power from judges presents a \" real problem \" in the separation of powers between the executive branch and the judiciary. A cool and collected mitt romney, who didn't go on the attack against gingrich, explains his perceived flip-flops on gay rights and abortion.

As debate rages over this year's budget, the gop is looking ahead: house republicans plan to propose big cuts to entitlement programs like medicare and medicaid in the 2012 budget, shifting the focus from discretionary spending — on defense and education, for example — to entitlement programs, which, the journal notes, play a larger role in the deficit.",

The violence came a day after assad formally lifted emergency law, a move that did little to appease protesters and followed the government's usual concession-followed-by-crackdown pattern, notes the new york times.

A source tells reuters that multiple tech companies are looking into purchasing twitter, which — despite being a force in news and popular culture — is losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year while being overtaken by upstarts like snapchat and instagram. But with 313 million monthly users, twitter \" might be limping, but it's not lame, \" according to recode, which estimates the company could go for anywhere between $ 18 billion and $ 30 billion. Experts say google makes the most sense to buy twitter, as it has the money and hasn't been able to get its own social media efforts to take off. But a source tells reuters that salesforce.com is also very interested. That's slightly surprising as salesforce \" has virtually no presence in consumer media, \" instead focusing on \" cloud-based computing services. \" but cnbc notes buyers may be as interested in twitter as much for the massive amounts of data it generates as anything else.

            "As of writing, a kickstarter campaign for \"just making potato salad \" has raised $ 37,115. Every few seconds that number climbs higher, and each uptick is greeted with cheers. It's a self-perpetuating humor machine, and it is horribly efficient. There is no joke, at least not anymore; whatever joke there was has become an adaptive, joke-like arrangement of circumstances. It is a perfect device, compatible with all known theories of humor and therefore with none of them. — the superiority theory, which suggests that all humor derives from a feeling of \"sudden glory, \" explains potato salad: its participants have money so disposable that they can spend it on nothing. But the inferiority theory of humor, which holds that much humor derives from modesty, works too: it is both an assertion of cruel dominion over the world and an act of self-deprecation to donate",

The latest forecast from the us energy information administration predicts that us output will grow next year to 11.8 million barrels a day, the ap reports. \" if the forecast holds, that would make the us the world's leading producer of crude, \" says linda capuano, who heads the agency, a part of the energy department. Saudi arabia and russia could upend that forecast by boosting their own production, something president trump has urged the saudis to do to contain rising prices. The united states led the world in oil production for much of the 20th century, but the soviet union surpassed america in 1974, and saudi arabia did the same in 1976, according to energy department figures. The last decade or so has seen a revolution in american energy production, however, led by techniques including hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling. The us has been pumping more than 10 million barrels a day on average since february, and probably pumped about 10.9 million barrels a day in june, the energy agency says. But the price may not hold: marketwatch reports that oil futures saw their biggest slump in 13 months on wednesday amid global economic worries.",

The times story primarily centered around former google exec andy rubin, who got a $ 90 million exit package despite leaving google amid sexual assault claims that a google investigation found to be credible. But rich devaul, who worked at google parent company alphabet's x division, was also named in the article as having allegedly invited a hardware engineer who was interviewing for a position at google to burning man and told her he and his wife were polyamorous. The woman attended, in professional attire and with her mother alongside her, but devaul still allegedly asked her to take off her clothes and offered to give her a massage, per the verge. She didn't get the job, and found out that at burning man devaul already knew she wasn't going to. She told the times she told google about the situation and the company assured her \" appropriate action \" would be taken and asked her not to publicize the story — but devaul remained employed by alphabet. Devaul, reached for comment by the times, apologized for his \" error of judgment. \" axios reports that devaul resigned tuesday and did not receive an exit package. Meanwhile, a group of more than 200 google engineers who are angry about what the times investigation revealed are planning a companywide walkout for thursday, buzzfeed reports. Google ceo sundar pichai told employees in an email tuesday he supports the walkout, and pledged that the company will take a \" much harder line \" against sexual misconduct going forward, per axios.

        "summary": "Amid the furor over concussions in the nfl, a new study finds that players are at a higher risk for the injuries during games played when it's colder out. Researchers looked at injury report data from all 32 nfl teams for the 2012-13 and the 2013-14 regular seasons, and found that during games played in temperatures of 50 degrees fahrenheit or lower, players had double the risk of concussions compared to those in games played at around 70 degrees or warmer. There was also a 1.5 times higher risk of ankle injuries in the colder games, and a 1.36 times higher rate of shoulder injuries for players in games on natural grass ( as opposed to synthetic turf ), upi reports. The canadian researchers say this is the first study to show such a link with the weather, notes the toronto globe and mail. The study did not identify why the higher risk exists, but \" at colder temperatures, materials and equipment in the playing environment have a lower elastic potential, and that may increase the impact forces that are transmitted during the game and increase forces to the head, \" the lead author says. It's also possible that concussions are simply under-reported for games at warmer temperatures, since players might incorrectly believe they are simply dehydrated or overheated. During colder games, athletic staff might be more quick to realize concussion symptoms, because they are interacting with players more often to keep them warm on the sidelines. As for the ankle injuries, the lead author says it's possible bodily reflexes don't work as well in the cold, making injuries more likely. ( a new report on the nfl's concussion research is quite damning. )",

Justin trudeau told obama that he plans to follow through on his campaign promise and end canada's role in the airstrike campaign against isis in iraq and syria, cnn reports. Trudeau, who didn't say exactly when the fighter jets sent by ousted prime minister stephen harper last year would withdraw from the fight, said obama \" understands the commitments i have made around ending the combat mission, \" reports the cbc, which notes that trudeau's liberal party has pledged to focus on humanitarian aid and training missions instead of airstrikes. The white house says the two leaders talked about issues such as the trans-pacific partnership trade deal and efforts to fight climate change, on which trudeau plans to work more closely with the us than harper did. \" canada's days of being a less-than-enthusiastic actor on the climate-change file are behind us, \" trudeau said on tuesday, per the bbc. Trudeau said the tone of the call was \" warm, \" and obama teased him about his lack of gray hair, reports the cbc. \" he said that i will probably get some quite soon, just like him, \" trudeau said. ( when trudeau was a few months old, richard nixon predicted that he would become prime minister. )",

New findings offer an even bleaker picture: we might be inhaling dna from such bacteria, researcher phil smith tells the tribune. His work focused on livestock, the recipients of an estimated 80 % of antibiotics sold in this country. Smith and a colleague, greg mayer, investigated dust samples gathered from upwind and downwind of cattle feed yards using a vacuum process. To make things even less pleasant, that dust came from dried cattle feces, time reports. The scientists analyzed the genetic sequences found in the samples. \" the ' aha ' moment came when we saw how much more prevalent resistant sequences were downwind than upwind, \" mayer says. \" it was not just higher in some of them — it was 4,000 % more. It made me not want to breathe. \" while the study samples were all from within 200 miles of lubbock, texas, the researchers figure that cattle yards in that state as well as colorado, kansas, nebraska, and oklahoma emit about 46,000 pounds per day of particulate matter that can be inhaled, time reports. Still, other experts aren't quite ready to accept the findings, the tribune notes. A veterinarian who works with cattle feeders says many antibiotics that cattle receive aren't the same as those used on people: \" the judicious use of antibiotics as we are using them today has very little risk to human health. My children work with me in the feedlot; my wife works with me. Am i concerned for their safety? no, i ' m not. \" ( mcdonald's is doing its part to fight superbugs. )",

Sentencing project chief marc mauer tells the star-telegram there's a \" great deal of misinformation \" among states on the complex laws surrounding voting protocol for felons, and that black felons are disproportionately disenfranchised compared with others. He also says there needs to be \" perspective \" when courts dole out punishments in such cases. As for mason, \" i don't think i ' ll ever vote again, \" she told the star-telegram after being indicted last year. St. John says an appeal has been filed.",

On tuesday, will gadd and sarah hueniken managed to pick their way up a frozen section of horseshoe falls, which is the biggest of the three waterfalls that make up niagara and said to be the most powerful waterfall on earth, reports national geographic. News of the historic climb was supposed to stay under wraps until after the super bowl. But after news leaked, sponsor red bull confirmed the story. In a press release, gadd explains that cold temperatures slowed water flow, \" allowing climbable ice to form \" ( that wouldn't be the case in a warm winter ). But what did form doesn't sound easy to scale. \" there's a layer of ice, then snow ( with a lot of air ), then another layer of ice. It's unstable, for sure. \" gadd, 47, tells the new york daily news it was \" very real on that wall, \" with variations in ice thickness ranging from an inch to 10 feet. \" there's a lot to account for, all this with the world's most powerful waterfall flowing over my shoulder. \" quite literally: he was so near running water \" i could reach out and stick my ice tool in the niagara falls. At one point i was behind the water, climbing on ice that froze behind the falls. I got a whole lot of niagara down my neck! \" he tells national geographic that the toughest part wasn't the roughly 150-foot climb, but the year of dealing with red tape involved in getting permission from authorities on the new york side of the falls to make the climb.

All this puts restaurants and food makers in a bind — and the solution, the wall street journal reports, is \" stealth health. \" this refers to companies secretly improving the healthiness of their offerings without telling the customers, at least not until they've already gotten used to the altered version. \" when you tell people something's healthy, they think it doesn't taste good, \" says an exec at boston market. In the fourth quarter of last year, that restaurant chain reduced sodium in several products; it finally told customers about it in february. Kraft didn't tell anyone when it cut trans fats from oreos in 2006. And general mills kept quiet about sodium cuts over six years in hamburger helper, using ingredients such as garlic to maintain flavor. \" it takes multiple months, if not years, to get the right equation between taste and health, \" says a company health officer. But it all depends on the product and its audience: fans of progresso soups, also made by general mills, want to eat more healthily — so when sodium was cut in the soups, the company made sure customers knew. Like it or not, we may be seeing lower salt levels in our food soon: the fda is readying new sodium guidelines, the ap reports.",

        "summary": "The food and drug administration has banned only the second medical device ever, and it's sort of an unlikely one: powdered medical gloves. Powder has for decades been added to ( now a small minority ) of latex medical gloves to help healthcare workers put them on and remove them more easily. But since the late 1990s, studies have suggested a strong link between their use and a host of medical problems, including allergies if the powder becomes airborne, as well as wound inflammation and even the formation of bands of scar tissue between organs, live science reports. The fda proposed banning the gloves in march, and it now officially has, reports the regulatory affairs professional society. Not everyone is thrilled with the fda's swiftness on the ban: public citizen's health research group called on the agency to do so in 1998 and 2011 and calls the 18-year delay \" reckless negligence. There is absolutely no new scientific information today that we didn't have in 1998. \" the fda, meanwhile, said it would have been too disruptive to the market of a critical device back in the 1990s, when the gloves were more common. The new york times reported earlier this year that hospitals began switching to safer alternatives in the late 1990s and today only a very small percentage are powdered. The ban kicks in on jan. 19. As for the first device banned by the fda? prosthetic hair fibers were banned back in 1983. ( protective gear like gloves also help spread infections. )",

In the piece, nick bilton writes that founder elizabeth holmes created an intense culture of privacy at her company, one that prevented scientists and engineers from talking to each other about their work and that immediately quashed any internal speculation that theranos'science might be a little iffy. In fact, bilton reports that holmes ' own seeming inability to explain the science hurt her in a big way. He recounts how john carreyrou, the wall street journal reporter whose investigative piece doomed the company, first became suspicious when he read a quote from holmes in which she gave an inept scientific explanation of what her company did. For the record, that quote: \"a chemistry is performed so that a chemical reaction occurs and generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample, which is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel. \" his resulting piece left the strong impression that holmes was perpetrating a giant sham. ( in the aftermath of the article, holmes held a pep rally of sorts for employees, who chanted, \" f --- you, carreyrou \" as their boss derided the article as false. ) one disturbing part of the piece: bilton reports that holmes pushed ahead with her plan to set up theranos sites at walgreens around the us even though her own chief scientist had reservations. That scientist, ian gibbons, eventually committed suicide when he feared he was about to be fired, he writes. Click for the story, which details holmes'deep reverence of steve jobs. )",

        "summary": "A convicted killer has escaped from a state prison in arkansas, sparking a manhunt near that state's borders of tennessee and mississippi. Authorities say 40-year-old lloyd jones escaped around noon monday while working at a construction site about two miles from east arkansas regional correctional facility in brickeys, where he was serving a 60-year sentence for the murder of a teenage girl, reports the arkansas democrat-gazette. Jones was allowed on work detail under armed guard, per kark, but it isn't clear how he managed to escape. A rep for the arkansas department of correction says \" every resource possible, \" including k-9 dogs and helicopters, is being used to find jones, described as 6 feet tall, 205 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes. \" the search perimeter is focused around the escape location and adjacent areas, \" authorities say, noting the area includes fields, swampy creeks, and ditches. They add that jones — who has tattoos of dragons, flames, a woman, wizard, castle, skull, and snake — may not get far in high temperatures without water. Jones was paroled in 2008 after a 2001 rape conviction before he lured 16-year-old angela allen on social media in 2012, per the democrat-gazette. He then strangled the teen and buried her body on his family's property. He was originally sentenced to 60 years in prison for murder, 20 years on two child-pornography charges, 10 years on another child porn charge, and 10 years for abusing a corpse. The sentences were to run concurrently, reported the times record.",

Perez, now 20, got 180 days in jail for second-degree manslaughter and was banned from owning firearms for life. Now the details are out: \" i can't do it babe, \" she tells ruiz as the fatal moment approaches. \" i ' m so scared. \" but ruiz says he wants his videos to make money and be \" crazier \" than the mtv series, jackass. \" the most trustworthy person that i trust in this world is my girlfriend, monalisa, \" says ruiz, per the ap. \" so if i die, i ' m pretty much ready to go to heaven right now. \" she begs, \" babe, i ' m not doing this, i can't, \" adding, \" babe, if i kill you what's gonna happen to my life. Like no this isn't ok. I don't want to be responsible. \" perez was visibly pregnant at the time with the couple's second child, but ruiz was confident, having practiced the shot on another encyclopedia. \" come in a little bit more, little more, \" he urges as she keeps trying to dissuade him. When it happens, the bullet throws perez back and he dies on the scene.
