        "summary": "The largest tsunami in hawaii's recorded history struck in 1946. Now, scientists have uncovered evidence that they say indicates the 8-foot wall of water was dwarfed by one as much as 30 feet high that came centuries before. The discovery of the makauwahi sinkhole on kauai in the late ' 90s ultimately led to the new theory: a little more than 6 feet below the surface of the collapsed limestone cave was a sediment layer flavored by the sea: it contained bits of coral, mollusk shells, and sand. Its mouth, however, was about 325 feet from shore and blocked by a 23-foot wall, according to a press release. The paleoecologist who found it couldn't reconcile those figures with hawaii's current tsunami evacuation maps, which were based on the 1946 tsunami. That one was triggered by an 8.6-magnitude quake in the aleutian islands and would have sent water only about 8 feet up the sinkhole's wall. But japan's devastating 2011 earthquake led scientists to do some new modeling. Per the study, they determined that an aleutian quake with a \" moment magnitude of ~9.25 \" could create a wall of water between 26 and 30 feet — enough to make its way into the sinkhole. Radiocarbon dating of marine deposits from the sinkhole, sedanka island in the aleutians, and along the west coast indicate a tsunami occurred between 350 and 575 years ago, though the dating doesn't prove it was a single tsunami. Still, geophysicist gerard fryer says he's \" absolutely convinced it's a tsunami, and it had to be a monster tsunami \"; he has worked with honolulu to update its evacuation maps to account for such a monster. \" the revisions to maps are extensive, in some cases twice as far inland, \" the study's lead author tells scientific american.

And the east aleutian seafloor is easily capable of unleashing this size of calamity again, scientists say. The giant wave would also run up the shore of the big island, if it was triggered by a quake as strong as the one that devastated japan in 2011.

Scientists say they're in awe after discovering five \" drowned apostles \" in a linear formation hiding 160 feet underwater a few miles offshore. Melbourne university phd student rhiannon bezore was studying a sonar scan of the area when she spotted what \" looked suspiciously like sea stacks and i literally did a double take, \" she tells the sydney morning herald. Colleague david kennedy understands why. \" this is the first time in the world we have seen underwater sea stacks, \" the geologist tells reuters. \" they don't last long due to erosion and according to all the textbooks they shouldn't be there. \" scientists believe the limestone columns have been around for 60,000 years — longer than the 12 apostles, of which only eight remain — but broke apart from the cliff face, per a release. Kennedy believes the structures were drowned so quickly by rising seas around the end of the last ice age 11,000 years ago that \" the waves just went over the top and they didn't have time to knock them over. \" the waves may have shortened the structures, though: the largest stretches about 32 feet high, while its neighbors closer to shore reach up to 130 feet high, per reuters. The 12 apostles are easier to visit since they don't require a wet suit, but they won't be around forever. Bezore warns they're eroding about 1 foot per year.

Human stem cells are then inserted in hope that a human organ, such as a pancreas, will develop instead when the embryo is placed inside a pig's womb. Researchers are proceeding cautiously, removing the so-called \" chimera embryos \" for dissection after a few weeks gestation, but concerns remain. One is that the human stem cells ( which can become any type of tissue ) could create human brain cells in the pigs and change their \" cognitive state, \" per the technology review. Another is that the chimeric pigs could end up with human sperm and eggs, mate with other chimeras, and give birth to a creature that's part-pig, part-human. \" you're getting into unsettling ground that i think is damaging to our sense of humanity, \" says stuart newman, a professor at new york medical college.

However, animal rights groups have called the methods 'frankenscience ', arguing it is cruel to create genetically-modified animals. National health service ( nhs ) figures show 429 people died in 2014 while waiting for an organ transplant in britain. Animal-grown organs could radically reduce this number. Twenty farm animals in the us and roughly 30 more worldwide have been impregnated with the chimera embryos, the mit technology review estimates. In the us, the livestock have been impregnated at university research labs. In order to create the chimeras, scientists first remove the genes for a specific organ from an animal embryo. They then replace these with human stem cells. The modified embryo is then placed in the womb of a sheep or pig, where it grows containing a",

The researchers hope these embryos, known as chimeras, could eventually help save the lives of people with a wide range of diseases. One way would be to use chimera embryos to create better animal models to study how human diseases happen and how they progress. Perhaps the boldest hope is to create farm animals that have human organs that could be transplanted into terminally ill patients. But some scientists and bioethicists worry the creation of these interspecies embryos crosses the line. \" you're getting into unsettling ground that i think is damaging to our sense of humanity, \" says stuart newman, a professor of cell biology and anatomy at the new york medical college. The experiments are so sensitive that the national institutes of health has imposed a moratorium on funding them while officials explore the ethical issues they raise. Nevertheless, a small number of researchers are pursuing the work with alternative funding. They hope the results will persuade the nih to lift the moratorium. \" we're not trying to make a chimera just because we want to see"

Relying on early forensic tests, police say the 71 victims — including three children and a baby girl — ran out of air while packed five people per 10 square feet, reuters reports. The refrigeration truck was designed to transport meat and apparently had no air holes. \" we are still awaiting the final report from the forensic team, but it looks like they suffocated, \" says a police spokesman. Meanwhile, police in neighboring hungary have detained five people in connection with the deaths who could face 16-year sentences for human trafficking, the wall street journal reports. The migrants are thought to be from syria or afghanistan. The tragic incident — and the massive flow of migrants moving through europe — has put added pressure on officials to find solutions, yahoo news reports. With britain, france, and germany pushing for a faster response, it was announced today that european union home-affairs ministers will meet on sept. 14 in brussels. So far, european governments have talked about tougher trafficking laws and measures designed to dissuade migrants from attempting the trip without \" a well-founded asylum claim, \" the journal says. Meanwhile, authorities found a five-year-old and two one-year-olds critically ill in a van in austria along with 23 other migrants. Hospitalized for dehydration, the children \" were stable enough to be able to make the decision to leave the hospital, \" a doctor says.",

He was killed in november, but not before penning a note that reportedly read: \" if you're reading this, then know that i've been killed in battle and am now with our lord. \" the court papers were filed monday in manhattan federal court in a case against arizona man ahmed mohammed el-gammal, accused of helping goarany get to syria, amnewyork reports. The two men apparently started messaging each other on facebook in august 2014, after goarany, a student at an unnamed manhattan college, noticed gammal posting pro-isis comments. Per court documents: by october, the two men had met in nyc, and gammal started working with a turkish man to expedite goarany's journey overseas. By january 2015, goarany was in istanbul, and arrived in syria the following month. Gammal was arrested in august 2015 on a slew of charges, including providing and conspiring to provide materials to support the militant group; he's pleaded not guilty ahead of his dec. 5 trial. Goarany made a video in september 2015 after learning of gammal's arrest, noting he went to syria of his own accord. \" i didn't come to this decision with anybody's influence or anybody's recruitment, \" he said in the video, per cnn. Gammal's lawyers say reports of goarany's death are \" unreliable, \" noting it's possible he wrote the note so he could fall off the radar of those monitoring his activity, abc news notes.

If the social network is to live up to the hype, it ' ll have to be \" the next google — or better, \" experts tell msnbc. Opinions from around the web: sure, 845 million active monthly users and $ 3 billion in yearly revenue is nothing to sniff at. But a $ 75 billion valuation would make facebook worth 40 % of google, whose profits are 11 times the social network's — whose growth may already be slowing, msnbc notes. Indeed, while facebook's revenue jumped 88 % last year, that's down from the 154 % growth it experienced from 2009 to 2010, the wall street journal reports. And two quarters of 2011 saw a drop in facebook profits. The site faces big challenges in overseas advertising, whose development lags behind the us '. The site isn't even operating in the world's top social networking market: china, the los angeles times points out. And with mark zuckerberg holding 57 % of voting shares, he's got \" near-dictatorial power. \" that's more power that bill gates had at microsoft's ipo. And don't expect it to change, notes the new york times. Zuck has been \" remarkably focused \" on \" being the boss of facebook \" ever since he left harvard.

The uncommon victory for deric white is the culmination of a one-year battle in court after white dropped off his phone for servicing at the apple store on regent street in london, only to return 20 minutes later to find that employees had wiped his entire phone clean without asking permission first, reports the evening standard. When his wife learned that their 2014 honeymoon photos from the seychelles were gone, she cried, and white, who'd just beaten cancer, decided to wage another battle. \" having fought cancer, \" he says, \" i was not going to get defeated by apple. \" \" i did this for the common man, \" white says. \" it's not so much the money that i have won, but it's the moral victory.... It's a monumental victory. \" white asked for just over $ 7,000 so that he and his wife could take their trip a second time, but he was reportedly happy with the roughly $ 3,000 he was awarded instead. He says he and his wife plan to spend it on a trip to cornwall in the uk. In addition to losing his honeymoon pics and \" favorite \" video of a tortoise biting his hand, he lost pictures from an african safari, as well as photos of the medical team from his 10-month battle against cancer of the esophagus. White's case is a good reminder to regularly back up devices, notes the daily dot, since even tech support is far from infallible, and \" you never know when you could drop it in the toilet and lose everything. \" ( apple lost what could be a far bigger battle earlier this year. )",

Instead, all 128 crew members aboard the hms erebus and hms terror ended up dead. Nearly all of them actually survived until april 1848, when they fled ships that had been ice bound and sought help on foot, only to perish on king william island. Both shipwrecks were uncovered in the past four years, and gizmodo reports \" well-preserved bodies \" of some of the dead sailors have been located in graves. But what felled them all remained unknown though there was a theory: lead poisoning. Now, a study published in plos one concludes that wasn't it. The theory was born from prior tests on bone, hair, and tissue taken from some sailors'remains, with the thinking being that tin cans and the ships ' water filtration systems may have pushed levels upward. The canadian researchers laid out three hypotheses: that the sailors who survived longer would have more lead in their bones, that \" bone microstructural features \" that grew near the time of death would show higher levels than older tissue, and that the lead levels would be higher than those of other contemporaneous sailors. They then used a high-resolution scanning technique to compare bone and dental remains with those from the royal navy cemetery in antigua and found that none of the hypotheses held up — and so, \" taken together, \" the researchers found the lead poisoning theory unsupported. Where does that leave us? one of the researchers tells the cbc things could have just gradually deteriorated. \" they would have been starving.

But the state's five-year drought was so bad that all those farms sucked up enough groundwater to sink a solid three feet, thereby reducing the region's water storage capacity, reports a new study out of stanford university. \" california is getting all of this rain, but in the central valley, there has been a loss of space to store it, \" says a researcher tells courthouse news; they used satellite technology to precisely calculate the changes in elevation. \" when too much water is taken out of clay, its structure is rearranged at the microscopic level and it settles into a new configuration that has less storage space. \" unfortunately, she adds, that change is irreversible — and extracting groundwater in the future will be harder, \" like trying to suck water from a really thin straw. \" the record-setting drought made things dramatically worse fast, but it isn't entirely to blame; farmers have been over-pumping groundwater for decades, reports the central valley business times. But as the researchers report in the journal water resources research, there are solutions to the problem, including compelling farmers to draw water from the sandy or gravel layers of earth instead of clay, as they are less likely to permanently compact and replenish more easily through rainfall. Researchers are now trying to map central valley's sediment layers to better inform future solutions. ( there's more silver lining on the drought front. )",

        "summary": "Investigators trying to piece together the stunning assassination of kim jong un's half-brother believe the murder at kuala lumpur international airport on monday took just 10 seconds. Kim jong nam was preparing to return to his home in macau from a week in malaysia when he encountered two attractive women in the airport's busy terminal 2, the washington post reports, citing interviews with airport staff and police. One woman grabbed kim while the other sprayed liquid on his face and held a cloth on it for around 10 seconds. The pair then made a leisurely getaway, strolling through the terminal and waiting in line for a taxi, while their victim staggered to a counter seeking help before dying in an ambulance. The fast-acting poison the women apparently used is typical of north korean assassination attempts, according to the post. Results from an autopsy, which north korean diplomats reportedly tried to prevent, have not been made public. The bbc reports that two women have been arrested in connection with the case: a woman traveling on a vietnamese passport who was arrested wednesday, and a suspect with an indonesian passport arrested thursday. A police source tells reuters that the first woman arrested was the suspect seen on cctv with a shirt reading \" lol. \" sources in macau tell the south china morning post that kim moved around his adopted home without bodyguards, but told friends he feared his younger half-brother would have him killed sooner or later.",

Now british neuroscientists may have uncovered the roots of this mysterious ailment first identified in 2001. Writing in current biology, researchers say scans reveal certain brains are \" hardwired \" to produce strong emotions to everyday sounds, per the bbc. Scientists found differences in the anterior insular cortex region and its relationship with the amygdala and the hippocampus, both tied to memory. \" we think that misophonia may be heavily connected to recalling past memories, because people with misophonia have had very bad experiences, \" lead author dr. Sukhbinder kumar says. When sufferers hear sounds that annoy them \" they're triggering a recall, \" kumar adds. The maddening malady usually hits sufferers around age 12. One victim says his family chewing at the dinner table made him want \" to punch people in the face \" and take meals in his bedroom. In the study, scientists performed mri scans on 42 people, some with misophonia, some without, while playing sounds ranging from neutral rain to crying babies. Also playing were the most likely \" trigger sounds \" for sufferers such as eating, drinking, and even breathing. Brain changes were clear for those with misophonia, kumar says. Why those sounds spark a reaction remains unclear, but kumar hopes more research into the roots of the disease will lead to new treatments. ( misophonia means \" hatred of sound. \" )",

Steve stephens pulled into the mcdonald's drive-thru in erie on tuesday morning, ordering a 20-piece chicken mcnuggets and fries. While the man — wanted on suspicion of killing an elderly man on facebook live — \" acted normal, \" mcdonald's employee henry sayers says he recognized stephens from the news and had seen a report that he may be in erie. Staff immediately called 911. Sayers tells goerie.com they told stephens his fries \" were going to be a minute \" to try and stall him at the mcdonald's. But the restaurant's owner, tom ducharme, says stephens — probably getting suspicious — left without the fries. Police caught up with stephens as he was leaving the mcdonald's, initiating a chase that ended with stephens fatally shooting himself. It ended a three-day manhunt. \" i ' m just very proud of my staff and how they handled it, \" ducharme tells nbc news.",

And while the striking workers are largely employed in the company's wireline division — as opposed to its much larger wireless division — the times states \" customers can reasonably expect a deterioration in customer service quality. \" the striking workers install broadband internet, fix phone lines, and handle customer service in the northeast us. Verizon has trained nonunion workers to replace the striking employees, but only 10,000 to fill in for 36,000 mostly more experienced workers. Striking employees don't believe they can be replaced so easily, claiming verizon's customer service will be negatively impacted. The strike resulted from verizon being unable to agree to a contract with the communications workers of america, cnn reports. The union has a number of grievances, including verizon outsourcing 5,000 jobs, hiring non-union contractors at lower wages, and closing call centers. \" the main thing is that's it's taking good-paying jobs and taking them away from the american public, \" says one union board member. And while verizon's wireline division is shrinking with the popularity of wireless, it still posted an $ 8.9 billion profit last year. Bernie sanders, who briefly rallied with the striking workers in new york, chided verizon for paying its ceo an exorbitant amount while refusing to pay benefits desired by the union, according to the washington post. The strike — the biggest in the us since the last verizon strike in 2011 — could last anywhere from hours to months.",

        "summary": "President trump is delaying a decision on whether to withdraw from a landmark climate deal until after an international summit later this month. The move means the president will head to the g7 summit in italy at the end of may amid continued global uncertainty over whether the us will remain in the emissions-cutting deal struck in paris under the obama administration. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to renegotiate the accord, but he has wavered on the issue since winning the presidency, reports the ap. The latest: the official line: sean spicer said tuesday that trump wants to \" continue to meet with his team, \" seeking economic and environmental advice, as he works to make a decision. A meeting for top advisers to discuss the deal had been set for tuesday afternoon but was postponed. The bbc reports it's the second such cancellation, and no new date has been given. Big business wants in: on april 26, trump was sent a letter signed by giants ranging from apple and google to bp and shell making the case that staying in the paris agreement will create jobs and reduce climate-fueled business risks. A new york times op-ed's take: \" this is as close as big business gets to a consensus position. \" ivanka's role: a senior administration official said the president's inclination has been to leave the pact, but ivanka trump set up a review process to make sure he received information from experts in the public and private sector before making a decision. Cnn reports there's a schism among the president's top advisers, with his daughter and rex tillerson leaning toward in, and epa head scott pruitt and steve bannon lobbying for out. Why we can leave in the first place: the paris accord, signed by nearly 200 nations in 2015, was never ratified by the senate due to staunch gop opposition. It therefore does not have the force of a binding treaty, and the us could potentially withdraw from the deal without legal penalty. The world forges ahead: ten days of talks began in bonn, germany, on monday, with officials trying to come to a consensus on how to implement the agreement. The washington post reports the us does have a presence, though it points out zimbabwe's delegation is bigger than our own, which numbers seven. A dubious milestone: in late april, hawaii's mauna loa observatory registered a carbon dioxide reading of 410.28 parts per million — breaching the 410ppm mark and hitting a height the planet hasn't experienced in millions of years, reported scientific american.

Nicholl, a cpa who works for the university of illinois, apparently disliked having to listen to people talk on their cellphones as he commuted to and from work each day. So, police say, he got an illegal jamming device from china and started using it on the train. One fellow commuter says he once saw nicholl \" scowl \" at a man talking on a phone near him, then pull a device with five antennas from his pocket and turn it on; everyone who had been talking on their phones in the vicinity stared, bewildered, at the screens as the calls dropped. Pictures of nicholl and the device started making the rounds online, and police had been tipped off and had gotten nicholl's photo. On march 8, undercover officers set up a sting, saw nicholl enter a station, and had one officer follow him on to the train. As nicholl rode the red line, he allegedly switched on the device while the officer talked on the phone nearby. The officer lost the connection ( his police radio was jammed, too, reports the sun-times ), and nicholl was arrested. \" it's kind of a digital'stay off my lawn, you young people with your cellphones, ' \" the aforementioned commuter tells the tribune. Per the police report, nicholl confessed to using the device because \" he gets annoyed at people \" on their phones on the train. Nicholl, who had already been charged with misdemeanor jamming of cellphone calls back in 2009, was charged with a felony this time around: unlawful interference with a public utility. But, as the christian science monitor reports, some online commenters consider nicholl a \" folk hero \" for keeping trains quiet.",

            "Copenhagen, denmark ( ap ) — copenhagen zoo has killed a healthy giraffe because of rules imposed by a european zoo association to deter inbreeding despite a wave of online protests to save it. Zoo spokesman tobias stenbaek bro says it put down the male giraffe, named marius, on sunday using a bolt pistol and will feed its meat to carnivores in the zoo. Stenbaek bro says the zoo was recommended to put down the giraffe by the european association of zoos and aquaria because there were already a lot of giraffes with similar genes in the organization's breeding program. Stenbaek bro said eaza membership isn't mandatory but most responsible zoos are members of the organization, which works to conserve global biodiversity. An online petition to save marius had received more than 20,000 signatures.",
            "Media playback is unsupported on your device media caption the zoo insists the giraffe population must be kept \" genetically sound \" a bid to save a young giraffe from destruction at copenhagen zoo has failed, and the giraffe was put down on sunday morning. Thousands of people had signed an online petition appealing for a change of heart over the two-year-old called marius. The zoo said it had no choice because of its duty to avoid in-breeding. Marius was killed by a bolt gun, not a lethal injection, which would contaminate the meat. A post-mortem examination was broadcast live on the internet. A crowd of visitors, including children, watched as the carcass was skinned, cut up and fed to the lions. A spokesman for the zoo told the associated press the event allowed parents to decide whether their children should watch. \" i ' m actually proud because i think we have given children a huge understanding of the anatomy of a giraffe that they wouldn't have had from watching a giraffe in a photo, \" stenbaek bro told ap. The zoo's scientific director, bengt holst, told the bbc he had received death threats but would not alter his style of animal management. Image copyright afp image caption several institutions had offered to house marius before the giraffe was destroyed the uk's yorkshire wildlife park - which has a state-of-the-art giraffe house and the capacity for an extra male - was among several zoos which put in last-ditch offers to take marius.

On saturday night, the indianapolis star reported that the texas senator had a healthy 16-point lead over trump in voter support ( 44.8 % to 29 %, per a mike downs center for indiana politics tally, with kasich trailing at 13.3 % ). But less than 24 hours later, the star cited a new poll with much different numbers: according to an nbc news/wall street journal/marist poll released sunday, trump now has nearly the same percentage-point lead, with 49 % to cruz's 34 % and kasich's relatively steady 13 %. \" trump is positioned to corral all the [ state's 57 ] delegates, which will be a big prize toward winning the nomination outright, \" the director of the marist college institute for public opinion says in a statement. Not that the initial poll with cruz in the lead seemed to be a lock: the star on saturday noted that a realclearpolitics aggregation of six polls had come up with a 2.3-point lead for trump ( by sunday it was up to 4.1 points and currently stands at 7.8 ), while the director of the mike downs center had warned that the \" volatility of the electorate means all campaigns should view these results cautiously. \" more tellingly, the more recent nbc poll shows what the washington post frames as \" abject voter disgust \" with cruz and kasich's takedown plan, with a majority of voters ( 58 % ) disapproving of their idea to split up the primaries to keep trump's delegate count down. Meanwhile, on the democrats'side, the nbc poll shows hillary clinton with a slight edge over bernie sanders at 50 % versus 46 % and a 2.1-point margin of error — meaning it's more or less a dead heat, the star notes.",

Panama city fire chief alex baird tells cnn it could take weeks to complete the hundreds of requests for resident checks that have been received. Schools throughout the panhandle region, which still remains without power or reliable cellphone service in many parts, were also slammed. \" i would say every single school in bay county has some type of damage, \" a local school board member says, noting it may take weeks, months, or even years to get some of them fully back up and running.

        "summary": "A tourist pulled from the wreckage of a fiery helicopter crash in the grand canyon died from his injuries thursday, per nevada authorities. The clark county coroner confirmed in a statement that 31-year-old neil udall ( also ided as jonathan udall ) died at university medical center of southern nevada, the ap reports. He'd been with a group of fellow brits visiting las vegas when a sightseeing helicopter they were flying in crashed in part of the grand canyon on feb. 10. Three of udall's friends died. Udall was one of four people, including the pilot, hospitalized after the crash. The crash killed veterinary receptionist becky dobson, 27; her boyfriend, stuart hill, a 30-year-old car salesman; and his brother, jason hill, a 32-year-old lawyer. The friends, who were in las vegas to celebrate stuart hill's birthday, opted to take a grand canyon sightseeing helicopter tour on tribal land. Unlike the more tightly regulated air tours within grand canyon national park, helicopters quickly deposit tourists on the hualapai reservation and within the canyon for lunches, hikes, or pontoon boat rides, then whisk them away. In peak season, the reservation has 350 to 400 flights per day, per the faa. A preliminary report released wednesday says the helicopter made at least two 360-degree turns before crashing, but the ntsb doesn't say what caused the crash. A full report won't be completed for more than a year. The other survivors are the 42-year-old pilot, scott booth; ellie milward, 29, newly married to udall; and jennifer barham, 39. A hospital spokesman says all three remained in critical condition thursday.",

Smith, times political editor in print: monday, august 29, 2011 sarasota — hurricane irene bypassed the state and spared michele bachmann's first campaign foray in florida this weekend, but now she has to contend with hurricane perry. Even as the minnesota congresswoman and presidential candidate courted big crowds as part of a four-day campaign swing through the state, she faces a serious florida challenge from texas gov. Rick perry. First, she must convince voters she's preferable to a proven, small-government conservative who shares her evangelical bona fides but has executive experience. On top of that, she faces a perry campaign building a formidable florida organization. \" i like michele bachmann a lot, \" said stephen gately, a republican activist from pinellas county who was among more than 1,000 people at a bachmann rally in sarasota on sunday afternoon. \" but i ' m supporting gov. Perry. I prefer governors as our nominee. \" while bachmann was courting evangelical and tea party voters along the interstate 4 corridor, at least 50 gop activists from as far as brevard and collier counties converged at a tampa law office saturday to start a grass roots perry organization in florida. \" i spoke to rick perry thursday night, \" said wes maddox, a gop activist in tampa who went to texas a&m with perry, who is expected to make his first florida stop sept. 13 in tampa bay. \" he said, ' you tell them ( in florida ) help is on the way.'that's what"

Even though vodka still has a hold on volume, whiskey is projected to wrest the sales title away this year, according to euromonitor data cited by quartz. This is mainly because consumers are looking for libations with \" authenticity, heritage, and taste, \" according to a credit suisse analyst note, which calls the move away from vodka a \" generational rejection. \" imbibers are willing to pay top dollar, too, especially when it comes to bourbon: more-expensive premium bottles are in demand because they seem more interesting in flavor and history than vodka, and because aged, small-batch bourbons that have limited supply are seen as \" [ adding ] to the allure, \" notes quartz. Vodka once ran the hooch roost, capitalizing on its status in the ' 80s as being \" inoffensive and inexpensive, \" in quartz's words. It even ventured into flavored offerings, with unusual varieties such as smoked salmon, buttered popcorn, and peanut butter and jelly, notes faded industry. But vodka volume is experiencing slower growth than it has in a decade, notes quartz, with flavored vodkas apparently cutting into regular vodka sales instead of extending the overall channel. This hasn't deterred whiskey makers from concocting their own flavored creations: fifty new flavored whiskeys hit shelves in the first half of 2013. And nielsen data showed flavored whiskey made up 75 % of growth in the entire whiskey category for 2012, according to the new york times.

A new report by parks associates and cited by consumerist shows that 6 % of us households are using someone else's account to watch a streaming-video service ( think hbo go, netflix, hulu, amazon prime ) — and that programming pilfering will cost the industry $ 500 million this year. Young adults ages 18-24 use ott ( over-the-top ) video services paid for by someone else the most, with 20 % copping to it, per the cost of piracy report. Those numbers keep dropping ( e.g., only 10 % of the 25-34 set admit to this activity ), until they rise slightly in the 55-64 demographic, which consumerist notes could be from older parents using their adult children's accounts. \" credential sharing has a measurable impact on video services, \" a parks associates analyst says in the release. \" the impact on ott video revenues is especially troublesome as ott providers are investing large sums of money to boost their original content offerings. \" the company notes that a previous study of college students found little guilt or embarrassment present when using a \" borrowed \" password. Consumerist notes that while netflix makes it relatively easy for different people to use the same password ( its highest-level service plan allows for content to be streamed on four screens at once ), other services like hulu limit streaming to one device at a time, which limits the hit the service takes. ( if you are using someone else's hbo go password, don't whine about it when things go wrong. )",

For one thing, \" friday \" has sold 30,000 copies, billboard says; forbes had reported that it had been bought 2 million times on itunes. The lower figure means about $ 26,000 for black. Forbes also estimated that google makes $ 1 per thousand youtube views, meaning the singer would get a $ 20,000 cut of the $ 30,000 made from 30 million views. ( it's now at 47 million. ) but lowrey guesses that's lower, too, since the ad rates depend on how many people actually click the ads. She estimates a grand total of $ 40,000 or so — \" hardly chump change, but hardly $ 1 million either, \" lowrey notes. But on top of that, black's producers at ark music may be taking a cut after acting \" as a promoter, manager, and record label. \" the teen may thus be taking just half of that $ 40,000 — or less. Still, she stands to make a lot more money: after all, youtube sensations \" don't make money from a video, but because of it. \" if black signs with a traditional label, tours, sells merch...

It has been in place since the end of october, slat said. The plastic barrier with a tapered 10-foot-deep screen is intended to act like a coastline, trapping some of the 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic that scientists estimate are swirling in the patch while allowing marine life to safely swim beneath it. Fitted with solar-powered lights, cameras, sensors, and satellite antennas, the device intends to communicate its position at all times, allowing a support vessel to fish out the collected plastic every few months and transport it to dry land for recycling. \" we've given ourselves a year after launch to get this thing working, \" slat said.",

        "summary": "If anyone were going to create a 3d printer that would create cuddly objects made out of felt, it would be disney. And that's exactly what's happened, in conjunction with cornell and carnegie mellon universities. The printer \" slices \" a 3d model of an object into layers, then laser-cuts those layers into matching shapes made out of adhesive fabric and onto a building stage, pc world explains. Heat is then emitted to activate the adhesive, and the layers continue outputting in their proper order until they've stacked into the desired object. The user then simply peels away excess material little by little until the object materializes, per cnet. The printer was introduced at an april 18 human-computer interaction conference in seoul. In a disney research hub video, a tester creates a bunny and other soft, bendable objects, and how each piece of fabric bends depends on the cuts that are made, as the video explains. According to the drh paper about the printer, conductive fabric can be used as well, creating \" 3d models with touch sensing capability built into a soft print \" that are interactive. Two drawbacks cnet notes: this technology creates a significant amount of waste material, and the layers are very obvious. The tiny bunny created in the video would have to be larger to really minimize layers; disney says the 2.5-inch bunny seen here took about 2 ½ hours to print. ( a 3d printer allowed nasa to email a wrench to an astronaut on the international space station. )",

In other words, healthy sperm are very much a part of the equation, and the entire couple's \" lifestyle factors \" are associated with pregnancy loss, national institutes of health and ohio state university-columbus, researchers report in the journal fertility and sterility. The study followed 344 singleton pregnancies in texas and michigan, and observed 98 miscarriages ( or 28 % ); the results produced three factors associated with an increased or lowered risk of miscarriage. Specifically, the researchers found that in the window of preconception, a woman being over age 35 nearly doubled her risk of miscarriage, while her adherence to vitamins halved it; continuing to take vitamins once pregnant dropped the risk of miscarriage by 79 %. Caffeine consumption by men and women, meanwhile, influenced miscarriage rates almost identically, raising risk 73 % and 74 %, respectively. The researchers note that this does not establish causation. As cosmopolitan reports, it's tough to know whether women who experience the symptoms of a healthy pregnancy, such as food aversions and nausea, \" naturally veer away from caffeinated beverages before they realize, ' hey, i ' m pregnant! ' \" which would mess with results. ( a man's sperm has even been linked to his progeny's weight. )",

But things took an unexpected turn when the 35-year-old pahoa resident was tased by a park ranger and arrested after sending up a 3-inch quadcopter drone to take video of the kilauea volcano, hawaii news now reports. \" my toy has some lights on it, so i thought it would be fun to fly it up and down.

Wrong — because unmanned aircraft ( with \" aircraft \" legally defined as \" a device that is used or intended to be used for flight in the air \" ) aren't allowed in national parks, says park spokeswoman jessica ferracane. She adds that sanders didn't comply with the ranger's requests to stop. Ferracane tells the ap the ranger had to ask sanders three times to bring down the drone and that he refused to identify himself. Sanders tells news now there were no signs indicating drones weren't allowed ( the park says the rules are on its website ) and that he didn't know the guy was a ranger. \" he sounded very angry, confrontational … and i didn't really want to stick around for it, so i just told him, ' i don't have id and i ' m leaving. \" sanders was stun-gunned close to the edge of the caldera ( it has a 500-foot drop ) while his daughter screamed at the ranger. He spent the night in jail before being released on $ 500 bond.

While searching for the boeing 777 that vanished with 239 people on board after departing kuala lumpur in march 2014, a ship itself disappeared more than 1,200 miles off western australia, reports the guardian. Ten days into a 90-day search commissioned by malaysia — which will pay up to $ 70 million if the ship is found — the seabed constructor from us-based company ocean infinity apparently turned off its satellite monitoring system thursday, leaving it untrackable in the indian ocean. It reappeared three days later en route to a scheduled refueling stop in fremantle, australia, but neither ocean infinity or the malaysian government have offered an explanation for the disappearance, which has sparked wild conspiracy theories. Some speculated that the crew was actually pulling treasure from a peruvian shipwreck nearby, per news.com.au. With malaysian officials saying only that flight 370 wasn't found during the first week of the search that began jan. 22, others say the seabed constructor might've found an area of interest and turned off its automatic identification system to protect passengers'relatives from undue distress at seeing the ship focused on a particular spot. The wide-ranging speculation is perhaps no surprise given this search was \" shrouded in mystery \" from the outset of the deal signed in january after months of negotiations, reports new york. An interesting tidbit the magazine uncovered: \" a so-called anchor-handling vessel designed to support offshore oil drilling \" was seen heading for a rendezvous with the seabed constructor days before the search began.",

Police say videos from the cameras, which can be remotely operated, show multiple people dating back to 2008. And starnes, who looked at the sd card from the camera after discovering it, says it filmed him while he was naked in the bedroom. \"my wife and i are distressed by this situation, \" starnes says. \" i hope more victims will come forward. \" airbnb has \" permanently banned \" natt, who had been a host for two years and whose airbnb listing specified no guests under the age of 18.",

Now one group is threatening to sue if the owners don't find a more natural home for the rare animals, reports the houston chronicle. Bred in captivity, the tigers — marina, coral, nero, and reef — are between 12 and 13 years old. The animals live in a \" dungeon-like conditions \" with no access to sunlight or fresh air, the san francisco-based animal legal defense fund wrote in a notice that precedes a lawsuit, per the dodo. A lawyer for landry's, the company that runs the aquarium, called those charges \" false and manipulative \" and said \" our tigers receive the highest level of care and treatment. \" the tigers risk developing painful joint, muscle, and circulatory problems living in \" unnatural, unyielding \" concrete, the aldf contends. The group is giving aquarium owner landry's 60 days to find a better home — and they're offering to pay for it. The legal threat follows new standards under consideration by the association for zoos and aquariums calling for more outdoor space and vegetation for tigers, per the chronicle. Landry's says the tiger pen meets aza standards, a fact that hasn't quelled critics. ( dozens of tiger cubs were found dead in a temple freezer. )",

A police report, contemporaneous reporting, and a congressional investigator who was probing kennedy's death further undermine o'reilly's story. George de mohrenschildt was a russian emigre who befriended kennedy assassin lee harvey oswald and testified before the warren commission investigating the kennedy assassination.

[ youtube ] fox news host bill o'reilly told colleague john stossel on tuesday that the recent criticism directed at him was not only based on professional jealousy, but political maneuvering. \"we are putting tremendous pressure on the obama administration to fight the terror savages, \" o'reilly said. \"and with hillary clinton coming up in 2016, [ if the ] network wasn't around, what would happen? \" o'reilly invited stossel onto his show amid new allegations questioning his",
            "Bill o'reilly has repeatedly claimed he personally \" heard \" a shotgun blast that killed a figure in the investigation into president john f. Kennedy's assassination while reporting for a dallas television station in 1977. O'reilly's claim is implausible and contradicted by his former newsroom colleagues who denied the tale in interviews with media matters. A police report, contemporaneous reporting, and a congressional investigator who was probing kennedy's death further undermine o'reilly's story. George de mohrenschildt was a russian emigre who befriended kennedy assassin lee harvey oswald and testified before the warren commission investigating the kennedy assassination. On march 29, 1977, the same day he was contacted by the house select committee on assassinations, he committed suicide at his daughter's home in florida. At the time, o'reilly was a reporter for dallas ' wfaa-tv who regularly reported on",
            "( first published in jfk facts, january 30, 2013 ) in his best-selling book killing kennedy, bill o'reilly tells a brief tale of an intrepid reporter — himself — chasing the historical truth of jfk's assassination in south florida. But the story itself is a fiction, as o'reilly reveals here in his own voice. In the annals of the jfk assassination story, rife with cia and fbi malfeasance, o'reilly's fanciful anecdote might seem trivial. It is not the saddest feature of his book, which manages to ignore all of the high-quality jfk assassination scholarship of the last two decades. But as o'reilly's yarn is presented as fact in usa today and the fort-worth telegram; as his book dominates the best-seller charts; and as a credulous national geographic embarks on making a documentary of killing kennedy, o'reilly"

Best song???? f**k off!!! \" he wrote, according to tmz. Furnish continued, \" madonna winning best original song truly shows how these awards have nothing to do with merit. Her acceptance speech was embarrassing in it's narcissism. And her critisism of gaga shows how desperate she really is. \" for his part, john looked none too pleased when the cameras cut to him during madonna's acceptance speech ( watch at left ). The fightin ' words had started earlier in the evening, during john's red carpet interview ( watch at left ), when he said madonna \" hasn't got a f***ing chance \" of winning. During her own pre-show interview, madonna responded with a quip about john wearing a dress and said, \" may the best man win, \" the daily mail reports. Backstage after her win, she said that she hopes that sir elton will still speak to her, us notes. \" he's been known to get mad at me so i don't know, \" she continued. \" he's brilliant and i adore him so he ' ll win another award.
