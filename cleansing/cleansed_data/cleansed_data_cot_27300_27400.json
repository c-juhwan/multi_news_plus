The town of weston, fla., has passed an ordinance that specifically bans nightclubs, dance halls, and skating rinks, the south florida sun-sentinel reports. None of those establishments has ever existed in the suburban town, and the mayor says they want to keep it that way. \" this is something that we thought would protect the city, \" he says. Clubs and skating rinks have a nasty habit of attracting \" large crowds, \" and \" unlawful and/or undesirable activities, \" the town's city manager explains, citing recent incidents with drugs and alcohol at county nightclubs. Violence has also been a problem in florida clubs, with 20 people shot and killed in the past 10 years. But what of the weston youth desperate to shake their groove things? they ' ll have to settle for school dances and events at the ymca, the city commissioner says.",

        "summary": "The latest to slam madonna: electronic musician paul van dyk, who calls her \" so stupid \" in billboard. \" she made the biggest mistake of her career \" when she apparently referenced drugs \" in front of a crowd of 18-year-olds \" at the ultra music festival on saturday, he says. Madonna, introducing festival headliner avicii, asked, \" how many people in this crowd have seen molly? \" molly is a street name for mdma, the active substance in ecstasy. Madonna was called out for the question by deadmau5 earlier in the week, and she tweeted an explanation ( complete with a picture of her in mouse ears ) in response, but apparently van dyk was not convinced: she says she was referring to \" have you seen molly, \" a song by her friend that is totally not about drugs. That friend, cedric gervais, also insisted the song really is about a girl named molly who just so happens to make him, you know, \" want to dance. \" but tmz doesn't seem convinced either, likening the song to britney's \" if u seek amy. \" poor madonna — who's been in the news quite a bit thanks to the release of her latest album mdna — just can't catch a break this week: piers morgan welcomed madonna to twitter tuesday by informing her, \" you're still banned from my show. \" he later extended the ban to both his us and his uk show, but so far he hasn't explained his beef with madge. He did, however, tell tmz yesterday that he wants her to apologize for the mystery slight \" on bended knee. \" youtube declared madonna's latest video, \" girl gone wild, \" too racy for younger viewers and put an age restriction on it, e! reports. And abc isn't happy with her also-racy ad for new fragrance truth or dare, asking her to clean it up before it can air.

So pee against a wall treated with ultra-ever dry by ultra-tech, and urine will likely hit you and your pants and/or shoes. \" we saw this report on the internet and thought it looked interesting, \" mohammed nuru tells the san francisco chronicle, adding that the city spends \" a lot to send teams out and do cleanup. \" nuru, whose appropriate twitter handle is @mrcleansf, turned to twitter to ask the public to chime in with walls and locations that are regularly doused. Gizmag reports the \" super-hydrophobic \" paint, made by a florida company, is already adorning the walls of hamburg, germany's st. Pauli red-light district, where some signs apparently warn: \" do not pee here! we pee back. \" reuters previously reported it cost that city about $ 530 to paint a 65-square-foot area. Nuru tells fox 14 san francisco plans to also tack up signs letting would-be urinators know what awaits. \" hopefully that will discourage them, \" he says.

In fact, the nra tells the wsj that 22,739 senior citizens received firearm training from nra-certified instructors last year, up some 400 % from 2010. A feeling that the world is becoming a less predictable, more dangerous place is fueling the trend. Stephen eyler, 71, says he and his wife have felt threatened by strangers on two occasions, and they worry about random shootings, \" radicals, \" and people with mental problems — \" you see it on the news almost every day. \" so the couple got a pair of glock semiautomatic handguns ( his wife got a petite model ) and they plan on pursuing concealed-carry permits. Another senior citizen in michigan, byron rocheleau, tells wxyz, \" i don't want to go somewhere and say ' boy i wish i had my pistol '. Maybe i could be saving someone else's life. \" however, harvard health policy professor david hemenway tells the wsj that shooting an assailant is hard: \" if they're running at you, you have half a second or something, \" adding that having a gun at home increases the chance of suicide or accidental shootings. His suggestion: \" get a dog, get a good lock, get good neighbors, get a cellphone. \" but justyn vest, assistant manager of a range in california, says older shooters are some of the best trained. \" they have the most time, \" he tells kero. Some ranges even have senior days. After all, says rocheleau, if someone is threatening you, \" what are you going to do? answer the door in a butter knife? \"",

Cbs news reports a \" drunk and uncooperative \" michael bell jr. Got in an altercation with cops after having driven home to the house he shared with his mother and sister. Officer erich strausbaugh was heard yelling, \" he has my gun. \" a second officer, alberto gonzalez, then shot bell jr. In the head as the young man's family watched from 10 feet away, reports the kenosha news. But the elder bell says the officers'stories don't jibe with witness statements, and he believes gonzalez shot his son on the right, not the left — the latter being a position from which he wouldn't be able to see if his son had a gun. According to the private investigator bell hired, bell jr. Didn't have the gun ( his mother and sister say they tried to alert police that he didn't ): their working theory is that strausbaugh's gun holster got caught by the car mirror, and he mistakenly thought the pull he felt was bell jr.

How did the taliban pull it off for so long? a report in the new york times helps explain: the reclusive omar steadily reduced the number of taliban members he would see until by 2013, it was down to one: mullah mansoor. It seems that mansoor kept up the ruse for as long as he could, ostensibly pretending to pass along messages and issue orders in omar's name. Finally, the lack of credible evidence that mullah omar was alive — no video statements, for example — became too overwhelming. Mullah omar's son and brother kept getting turned away when they tried to visit, guessed correctly at the truth, and began spreading the word. So what's next for the taliban? mullah mansoor is now the official leader, but the organization faces what the bbc calls the \" biggest challenge \" in its history. Mullah omar was a revered figure whose presence held the group together, perhaps why mullah mansoor tried to keep him alive so long. Mullah mansoor's main task will be to keep the taliban from splintering. He's described as a pragmatist who favors peace talks with the afghan government, and his reportedly close ties with pakistan should help on that front, reports ap. But hard-liners in the group want to continue the insurgency, and the fear in the west is that they ' ll break off and join the islamic state.",

Senate candidate roy moore leaves the stage after speaking at the rsa activity center, tuesday, dec. 12, 2017, in montgomery, ala. Moore did not concede defeat to his democratic opponent doug jones. ( ap photo/mike stewart ) ( associated press ) birmingham, ala. ( ap ) — the latest on alabama's u.s. Senate election ( all times local ): 10: 40 p.m. Alabama republican senate candidate roy moore is not conceding to democrat doug jones, telling campaign supporters \" it's not over. \" \" it's going to take some time, \" the candidate says during a brief appearance before supporters. Campaign chairman bill armistead says that because the vote is close and approaching the state's recount requirement, \" we do not have a final decision on the outcome. \" alabama state law calls for a recount if the margin of victory is less than one-half of one percentage point. With all precincts reporting, jones leads by 1.5 percentage points — three times what's required to trigger a recount. If the secretary of state determines there were more write-in votes than the difference between jones and moore, the state's counties would be required to tally those votes. It's not clear how that would help moore, who ended the night trailing jones by more than 20,000 votes. __ 10: 10 p.m. President donald trump has congratulated democrat doug jones on a \" hard fought \" win in alabama, adding republicans will have \" another shot \" at the senate seat. Trump backed republican roy moore in the race, despite the multiple allegations of sexual impropriety against moore. Trump cited the need for gop votes on his legislative agenda.

George, the raw story finds. The new city would have around a quarter of baton rouge's residents, but would rake in some 40 % of its sales tax revenue with the help of two major retail centers. That would leave the northern part of the city, its population swollen by 200,000 former new orleans residents displaced by hurricane katrina, struggling to fund its services, according to a study examining the potential secession. Leaders of the st. George secession effort say they now have around half the signatures needed to put it to a vote, reports the advocate. They say the new city will be \" wide open \" and downplay warnings of fiscal disaster for the rest of the city, but opponents describe secession as unfair, noting that city funds were used to develop retail areas that would end up sucking in sales taxes from residents of the poorer part of the city. \" if they pull away from baton rouge, it will affect everyone, \" says a councilwoman. \" we've spent millions of dollars on improvements out there and making traffic better, and now they want to be their own city? \" ( click for the latest on colorado's secession efforts. )",

        "summary": "If you drink wine, there's a good chance you measure intake by the glass. Here's why that's problematic: modern wine glasses are seven times larger than those of centuries ago — and notably bigger than glasses that are just two decades old, according to a new study. Researchers at the university of cambridge analyzed more than 400 antique and modern wine glasses, including some of various british monarchs, and determined the average and median size of glasses has increased gradually since the 1700s, but with a \" more marked \" bump in the 1990s, per nbc news. Centuries ago, wine glasses held about 2.2 ounces on average, reports quartzy. But by 2000, they held about 10 ounces, per the bbc. Today they hold more than 16 ounces, or about half a liter, according to the study in the british medical journal. Wine consumption has similarly increased, quadrupling in britain between 1960 and 1980, then doubling again from 1980 to 2004, per the guardian. Researchers suggest a link between the increased consumption and bigger glasses, arguing that people pour more wine into a larger glass, which makes the amount seem less than if it were in a smaller glass. ( the researchers focused on the brits, but they say that a trend in the us toward bigger glasses likely had an influence. ) some say other factors explain why people are drinking out of larger glasses, with wine expert miles beale noting that they allow wine to aerate, \" something which perhaps wasn't a priority 300 years ago. \" ( avoid merlot? you might want to reconsider. )",

Facing a high national heroin-overdose rate, left-wing leaders in oslo and bergen want to treat hardcore addicts with a medical version of heroin that keeps them off the streets, away from crime, and away from bad heroin, the ap reports. \" we can't go on criminalizing our drug users, \" says an addict and member of a drug-policy campaign group. \" we need the trust between us and the health professionals. \" the new approach would include traditional therapies like methadone, but target the highest-risk users with medical heroin, or diamorphine. Originally marketed by bayer as a pain reliever, diamorphine was banned by most countries for being addictive. But trials in switzerland, denmark, germany, and the netherlands found that supervised use of diamorphine can be useful for addicts who don't respond to treatments like methadone. The goal of preventing overdoses may be laudable, but hurdles remain, including the drug's cost of up to $ 22,000 per year for each user. Also, addicts would \" need to show up at the same place and time several times a day, \" and \" many of these people are not capable of that, \" says one critic. Meanwhile, the us has seen heroin-overdose deaths rise by 286 % between 2002 and 2013, the cdc says, and the issue is coming up repeatedly in the presidential race, fox news reports.

            "Washington ( reuters ) - a computer used by paula broadwell, the woman whose affair with cia director david petraeus led to his resignation, contained substantial classified information that should have been stored under more secure conditions, law enforcement and national security officials said on wednesday. The contents of the classified material and how broadwell acquired it remain under investigation, the officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to comment publicly. But the quantity of classified material found on the computer was significant enough to warrant a continuing investigation, the officials told reuters. President barack obama told a news conference on wednesday there was no indication so far that any classified information had been disclosed as a result of the scandal. Obama also said he would refrain for now from judging whether he should have been told earlier than last wednesday about the probe involving his cia chief. \" i am withholding judgment with respect to how the entire process surrounding general petraeus came up. We don't have all the information yet, \" obama told a white house news conference. The president noted that had he known earlier, he might have been open to accusations of interference in a politically sensitive law enforcement matter. As a reserve officer in military intelligence, broadwell - co-author of a biography on petraeus - had security clearances that gave",

Security clearance has been suspended for his ex-mistress, paula broadwell. And jill kelley's pass at the florida air force base where she organised social events has been frozen. An fbi inquiry into mrs kelley's complaints of email harassment revealed that mrs broadwell and gen petraeus had been having an affair. Mrs broadwell, a 40-year-old married mother of two, had apparently sent the anonymous emails to mrs kelley warning her to stay away from gen petraeus. Those emails prompted mrs kelley to report the matter to a veteran fbi officer, now identified as frederick humphries. Mr humphries was described by one former colleague as a diligent agent. He knew jill kelley socially and she turned to him when she sought answers about the messages she was receiving. The investigation that he began led to the discovery of the affair between gen petraeus, 60, and mrs broadwell. It also enveloped afghanistan commander gen john allen. Obama's backing mrs broadwell, who wrote a biography of gen petraeus, held a security clearance through her work as a reserve army intelligence officer.

The new york times today takes a look at the difficulties that plagued the rescue effort, among them the steep and snowy slope that rescue teams had to climb with the victims in tow. Each injured person was hauled to the top by four to six workers, who used backboards, rappelling lines, and baskets to do so. Many of those victims spoke only korean, and the language barrier caused additional issues. But the biggest obstacle was the size of the accident, which was attended to by emergency workers employed by 10 area ambulance companies. The oregonian reports that those who survived the crash were taken to any one of a number of hospitals — at least 10 facilities in three states received victims. Informing the families of the victims has been a slow process, as many passengers were apparently ejected from the bus, separating them from their personal items.

The teams set up roadside triage and hauled injured people — many of whom spoke only korean — on stretchers up a steep slope down which the bus had rolled after crashing through a guardrail.

The low closing price is notable because a company can be delisted from nasdaq if its stock stays below $ 1 for a certain number of consecutive days. Deadline notes the company's cash-flow problem led to outages on the moviepass app over the weekend, specifically for subscribers trying to buy tickets for mission impossible: fallout. And not including major movie releases on the service may be the indefinite future: business insider reports that at an \" all-hands meeting \" on monday, moviepass ceo mitch lowe announced that the meg and christopher robin, coming out in theaters in early august, wouldn't be available to subscribers through the app. In a letter friday, lowe also said that subscribers wanting to see films \" in high demand on opening weekend \" would have to pay a surcharge — what he calls \" peak pricing, \" and which a moviepass rep told quartz earlier this month could mean a surcharge of between $ 2 and $ 6. Lowe also noted that \" as we continue to evolve the service, certain movies may not always be available in every theater on our platform. \" some users are calling this all a bait and switch, per the washington post, which calls the service's moves \" another step toward the abyss. \"",

Penn live reports justin dwyer, 29, and courtney stash, 28, called 911 when they found their son eoin unresponsive in his crib on april 25. During an interview three days later, authorities say dwyer's 8-year-old son told a detective what may have caused his brother's death. According to fox news, the boy reportedly told the detective dwyer and stash would put a mattress on top of eoin's crib, weigh it down with two 50-pound bags of rock salt, and secure the whole thing with a bungee cord in order to keep eoin from crawling out. But that's not all. Authorities say the boy told the detective he overheard dwyer and stash talking about how eoin's neck had been trapped by the mattress on the morning he was found dead.

        "summary": "First kurt eichenwald dove into donald trump's business ties abroad. Now, in a new éxposé for newsweek, the writer reveals trump's company secretly conducted business in cuba in the late ' 90s, even though such dealings were illegal under the american trade embargo. Based on interviews with ex-trump execs, court docs, and company records, eichenwald documents how trump sought the presidential nomination from the reform party in 1999 and made a campaign stop to speak to cuban americans in miami, where he swore he'd never spend a dime in cuba as long as castro was in charge. Yet months earlier, executives from trump hotels &amp; casino resorts had already blown $ 68,000 during a havana junket, ostensibly to explore possible future development opportunities. The money for the trip, later linked to a charity, came from a us consulting firm that was later reimbursed, eichenwald says. A former trump exec notes trump knew about the trip and had conversations about it. The problem: at that time, americans could only go to cuba with us permission for a very few legal reasons, and because us citizens and companies weren't allowed to spend money in cuba, a foreign entity ( in this case, a cuban charity ) had to pay for all expenses. Plus, the office of foreign assets control would have needed to have granted a license to the company and/or the execs who traveled there, and no proof of such a license has been unearthed. Eichenwald notes, however, the statute of limitations on these dealings has run out, and so neither trump nor anyone involved would now be prosecuted. \" as you know … putting money and investing money in cuba right now doesn't go to the people of cuba, \" trump told the group of cuban americans during the 1999 event. \" it goes to fidel castro. … he's a bad guy in every respect, and, frankly, the embargo must stand if for no other reason than, if it does stand, he will come down. \" ( read eichenwald's deep dive at newsweek. )",

        "summary": "Russian athletes should be banned from the rio olympics and future track and field competitions, say authors of a scathing new report on the country's systematic doping program. The report, the result of a 10-month investigation from an independent commission of the world anti-doping agency, says top athletes, coaches, trainers, doctors, members of russian law enforcement agencies, russia's own anti-doping agency, and a lab that handled testing for the 2014 sochi olympics, were in on the scheme, which involved payments to conceal doping tests, 1,400 destroyed samples, and leaking dates of tests to athletes, reports the new york times. Since the russian government provides funding and oversight to the implicated institutions, the system \" was effectively a state-sponsored regime, \" the report says. The report also finds the 2012 london olympics were \" sabotaged \" by \" widespread inaction \" against athletes with dubious doping profiles, reports the bbc. \" it's worse than we thought, \" says a co-author, noting the evidence has been turned over to interpol. \" this level of corruption attacks sport at its core, \" adds another. \" the russians themselves have said there are vestiges of the old soviet system, old-guard coaches who haven't changed and can't change. \" russia, which got a look at the report before it was published, has suspended five athletes, including distance runner maria konovalova. Wada will decide on possible punishments at a meeting next week. Last week, french authorities began investigating lamine diack, the former president of track and field's world governing body, who's accused of accepting bribes from russian athletes.

At nj.com, andrew mills explains how he got images of the governor lounging on a beach he had closed to state residents because of a budget impasse. Mills didn't know for sure that christie would be at the governor's residence on island beach state park, let alone on the beach itself. \" but when sunday's weather looked good, and the governor's schedule was open except for an afternoon press briefing in trenton, i wondered, ' what are the chances...? \" he called a pilot and up they went. Given that christie and his family were the only ones on the beach, they weren't hard to spot. At one point, the governor looked \" me dead in the eye \" as he snapped a photo, mills recalls. Coverage: defiant: christie insists he did nothing wrong. \" the governor is allowed to go to his residences and i ' m at my residences, \" he said, per fox5ny. The governor said he made clear last week that he'd be going to the site regardless of budget progress. \" what a great bit of journalism by the star-ledger, \" he added. \" they actually caught a politician being where he said he was going to be with the people he said he was going to be with, his wife and children and their friends. \" defiant, ii: in a separate defense on good day philadelphia, christie said of his critics: \" well, i ' m sorry, they're not the governor. This is a residence. \" time has more on the back-and-forth. Quite a spin: after the photos were taken on sunday, but before they were published, christie told reporters, \" i didn't get any sun today. \" asked about the comment later, a spokesman said it was true because christie was wearing a baseball hat. That's destined for the \" spin hall of fame, \" writes chris cillizza at cnn, who thinks that christie has perhaps \" stopped caring. \" fitting? so he made the bad decision to use the beach, then seemed to get caught trying to deny it, writes aaron blake at the washington post. \" it's a pretty perfect coda to a christie political career that is the stuff of greek tragedies, \" he writes. \" it's difficult to believe this is a man who was the gop's great hope just five short years ago. \" the memes: npr rounds up a few choice images on twitter",

The bill he signed doesn't actually name planned parenthood, cnn reports, but it bans ohio from contracting health services with any group that performs abortions, meaning that more than $ 1 million in state grants for services like cancer screenings will be sent elsewhere. Kasich has long been an outspoken opponent of abortion and had been expected to sign the bill, though it's not clear whether it will survive court challenges, cleveland.com reports. The move was denounced by planned parenthood chief cecile richards. \" this legislation will have devastating consequences for women across ohio, \" she said in a statement. \" john kasich is proudly eliminating care for expectant mothers and newborns; leaving thousands without vital std and hiv testing, slashing a program to fight domestic violence, and cutting access to essential, basic health care. \" the governor's office countered that the state's department of health has \" 150 other sub-grantees and contractors for the affected grants and projects, \" and they will be invited to submit proposals for the programs planned parenthood has lost funding for.

        "summary": "Joining the army wasn't bowe bergdahl's first military experience: he was in the coast guard for 26 days. Due to his departure before 180 days of service, he was given an \" uncharacterized discharge \" in 2006, friends tell the washington post; military records confirm the story. He left due to psychological issues; friends were reportedly concerned about him at the time. How he was able to join the army in 2008 is unclear, the post notes. A discharge related to psychological health would generally prevent future recruitment. Involved in two wars at the time, however, the army was providing waivers to one out of five recruits, according to 2008 data; these waivers allowed people with health issues and criminal records to join. One friend tells the post that bergdahl \" told me he faked \" his psychological problems after leaving the coast guard. \" he believed he was in control, but i didn't, \" says another. The paper has also obtained a wealth of bergdahl's writings from the period before his capture, and they paint a portrait of a troubled young man. Among the writings: \" the closer i get to ship day, the calmer the voices are. I ' m reverting. I ' m getting colder. My feelings are being flushed with the frozen logic and the training, all the unfeeling cold judgment of the darkness, \" he wrote, later adding: \" i will not lose this mind, this world i have deep inside. I will not lose this passion of beauty. \" he made lists, including one of \" movies 4 my insanity \" ( mary poppins and the silence of the lambs were among them ). He also made plans: \" one day, if i make it out of this, i will go around the world. I will not use airplanes, but only trains, boats, vehicles, and... ( if i still have them ) my feet. \" before joining the army, he often told friends about planned adventures at home and abroad, but after disappearing from ketchum, idaho, for a short while, he would return. Given his personality, says a friend, \"he is the perfect example of a person who should not have gone \" into the military. Also today, secret details of the thinking behind the bergdahl-taliban swap emerged.",

Bradley william stone, a 35-year-old former marine reservist who spent a few months in iraq and is said to have ptsd, is suspected of killing his ex-wife and five of his former in-laws, cnn reports. The first 911 call came in around 4: 30am yesterday, and police found stone's former mother-in-law and former grandmother-in-law dead in a house in lansdale. Shortly thereafter, a neighbor of stone's ex-wife, nicole, also called 911; police found nicole stone, 33, dead at an apartment in lower salford. The couple's two daughters, believed to be around 8 and 5 years old, lived with nicole stone, but they were unharmed; stone dropped them off with one of his neighbors in pennsburg around 5: 30am. The stones divorced in 2009 and were said to be in a bitter custody dispute. Around 8am, police found nicole stone's sister, her husband, and their 14-year-old daughter dead in their home in souderton; their 17-year-old son was wounded and is being treated in a philadelphia hospital. Before the teen was taken out of the house on a stretcher, swat teams had surrounded the home and stone was believed to have barricaded himself inside, abc news reports. But upon entering the home after firing a diversionary device, officers did not find stone, nbc philadelphia reports. A man resembling stone and wearing fatigues attacked a man in doylestown, in neighboring bucks county, last night, demanding his car keys; the man had a gun and fired shots at the suspect, who was last seen running into the woods. \" we do not know where he is, \" says the district attorney, who noted that officials have his vehicle, so it's not clear how he's traveling.

The arts and crafts retailer obtained thousands of illegally smuggled artifacts from iraq in 2010 — then subsequently agreed to send them back — and now that day has come. Us immigration and customs enforcement has announced that 3,800 of the 5,500 ancient items purchased from dealers in the uae and israel will be sent back to iraq on wednesday, per npr.

The doj had filed a civil action complaint in july 2017 after hobby lobby purchased the artifacts for $ 1.6 million, with the intention of displaying them in the museum of the bible it opened last fall in washington, dc. That purchase was made despite the company being warned by an archaeological ace that the artifacts could be stolen and that hobby lobby should make sure to definitively identify them. Some of the artifacts that came into the company's possession were mislabeled on either their contents or place of origin. It's not clear if hobby lobby, which said it made \" regrettable mistakes \" during the purchase, knew the artifacts were obtained illegally, or the status of the other 1,700 artifacts it purchased in the 2010 deal.",

The justice department in the eastern district of new york filed a civil complaint in 2017 accusing hobby lobby of purchasing 5,500 artifacts for a total of $ 1.6 million in december 2010 from the united arab emirates despite multiple warnings from an expert on cultural property law that \"could lead to seizure and forfeiture of the artifacts. \" steve green, the president of the nationwide arts-and-crafts retailer, traveled to the united arab emirates in july of that year to inspect cuneiform tablets and other antiques, the doj said.

That's what the southern california mother of three, who is pregnant with twins, is desperately seeking in her quest to find a bone marrow donor, people reports. Rabaca, who's due to give birth dec. 6, has acute myeloid leukemia, an aggressive cancer that starts in the bone marrow and can spread rapidly to the blood and other parts of the body. Rabaca discovered she had leukemia when she wasn't feeling well earlier in her pregnancy and went to the doctor, she tells wabc. Because the cancer is so severe, however, a 100 % bone marrow match is needed — a fact complicated by rabaca's genetic makeup ( she's half caucasian, half latino ). \" for a blood stem cell transplant to work, you need to find a match who has similar dna and ancestry to you, \" says a rep from the be a match marrow donor program, adding that even with 30 million people on the global marrow registry, not one syncs up with rabaca. Even her own sister was only a 50 % match. Rabaca and her family have been racing against the clock, promoting the registry on social media and imploring people to sign up. Abc7 says nearly 40,000 people have registered since it aired rabaca's story on thursday — a record-breaking number. \" it's a simple swab of your cheek. If you are my match, then it's a simple blood draw. … you can save my life, \" she says. In the meantime, rabaca tells fox 11 her family is keeping her strong. \" my 4-year-old, she just holds my hand, grabs my bald head … she's my little rock, \" she says.

The appeals court in chicago sided with karla dunston, a 43-year-old doctor who is now infertile after chemo treatments, reports the chicago tribune. She and then boyfriend jacob szafranski, who is 10 years younger, entered into an \" oral contract \" to create the embryos while they were dating and when dunston was diagnosed with lymphoma. They have since broken up, and dunston's attorneys made the case that this is her only chance to have a biological child. Szafranski plans to appeal to the illinois supreme court. \"mr. Szafranski agreed to create these embryos for one purpose: so that dr. Dunston could use them to attempt to have children if she survived cancer, \" says her attorney. \" in today's decision, the appellate court affirmed that he should be held to his promise. \" she wants no financial support from szafranski. Still, his legal team argues that it's unfair to impose fatherhood unwillingly on a man, reports the new york times, and the case could help establish a precedent in the growing number of such disputes around the country. \" if anything comes of those embryos, that is my child — that is half of me, \" says szafranski, per cbs chicago. \" it feels like an out-of-body experience where somebody is going to determine your destiny, without even asking me. \" ( a similar dispute involves modern family actress sofia vergara. )",

            "Hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos are in storage across the nation, most left over from in vitro fertilization procedures. When couples divorce, or simply disagree about how many children they want, dealing with those embryos can lead to bitter disputes. The actress sofia vergara and her ex-boyfriend, nick loeb, are having a very public dispute over what to do with frozen embryos they made that he wants to give to a surrogate to carry. Where such cases have gone to court, the party that does not want the embryos used has usually been the winner. But there is little consistency between the states in how to resolve such cases. In the illinois case, dr. Dunston, a chicago emergency room physician who had been given a cancer diagnosis, asked mr.

The kicker: they're believed to be between 10 and 11 years old. Though maconaquah elementary school is still investigating the incident, it says it will likely expel the four fifth-graders for the remainder of the school year because gang activity is banned according to school board policy, upi reports. School officials say the move followed a fight between two students, one of whom was reportedly barred from joining the supposed gang. At least 12 students believed they were involved in the group and some were handed a lesser penalty, reports the kokomo tribune. Superintendent doug arnold notes the gang even had a symbol, and at least one child was branded with it. \" my understanding is one of the students scratched themselves with this symbol and might have used a small blade they took from a pencil sharpener, \" he says, per fox 59. The child \" had a band-aid covering it and when the administrator approached the student it had been scratched on the arm. \" it isn't clear if any further action will be taken regarding the other students involved, though arnold says, \" we're going to investigate to make sure that there's nothing else involved. And if there is, it will be dealt with in a similar fashion. \" he notes that gang activity among fifth-graders was a surprise. \" i expect to hear that from middle and high school, but from elementary, i was shocked, \" a parent adds.

The pace of modern politics and the desire of journalists ( scourges! ) to always look ahead to the next campaign put a reelected incumbent in a race against irrelevancy from the second he is sworn in again. Scandals tend to creep in or escalate — watergate, iran-contra, monica lewinsky — and investigations follow, often drifting far afield. Momentum toward any meaningful achievement fades. Usually, a president has until the midterm elections of his second term to get big things done; after that, attention moves on to deciding who will next occupy 1600 pennsylvania ave. But obama may not have the luxury of even that truncated timeline. The split control in congress — democrats in charge in the senate, a republican majority in the house — combined with the tea party's continued demand for conservative purity from its elected officials and the politicization of just about everything makes it hard to imagine that 2014 will afford obama any chance to move his agenda through congress. And his addition of john podesta, a vocal advocate of taking executive action to end-run lawmakers, to the white house staff suggests that the president has effectively given up trying to work with the hill. All of which makes what happened — or more accurately, what didn't happen — in 2013 that much more dire for obama's",

            "Second-term presidencies are tricky. The pace of modern politics and the desire of journalists ( scourges! ) to always look ahead to the next campaign put a reelected incumbent in a race against irrelevancy from the second he is sworn in again. Scandals tend to creep in or escalate — watergate, iran-contra, monica lewinsky — and investigations follow, often drifting far afield. Momentum toward any meaningful achievement fades. Usually, a president has until the midterm elections of his second term to get big things done; after that, attention moves on to deciding who will next occupy 1600 pennsylvania ave. But obama may not have the luxury of even that truncated timeline. The split control in congress — democrats in charge in the senate, a republican majority in the house — combined with the tea party's continued demand for conservative purity from its elected officials and the politicization of just about everything makes it hard to imagine that 2014 will afford obama any chance to move his agenda through congress. And his addition of john podesta, a vocal advocate of taking executive action to end-run lawmakers, to the white house staff suggests that the president has effectively given up trying to work with the hill. All of which makes what happened — or more accurately, what didn't happen — in 2013 that much more dire for obama's",

Putin's call followed, and the washington post notes the competing tones in the two nations'respective statements about it. Samples from each: white house: \"president obama underscored to president putin that the united states continues to support a diplomatic path in close consultation with the government of ukraine and in support of the ukrainian people with the aim of de-escalation of the crisis. President obama made clear that this remains possible only if russia pulls back its troops and does not take any steps to further violate ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty. \" kremlin: \"vladimir putin drew barack obama's attention to continued rampage of extremists who are committing acts of intimidation towards peaceful residents, government authorities and law enforcement agencies in various regions and in kiev with impunity.

It appears on the humans of new york page created by photographer brandon stanton, who posts photos of people he interviews around new york city — and, occasionally, beyond, reports time. Stanton is currently visiting iran and yesterday posted a photo of an iranian 10-year-old and his father. In the photo's caption, the boy's father describes his son's charitable nature: once, when his son was 5, he asked the boy to carry home a two-pound bag of apricots they'd bought. Before they reached home, however, the man turned around to find his son had given all the fruit away. \" i knew then that i was raising a humanitarian, \" the man says. In a comment from the white house — liked 117,000 times and signed with the president's initials — obama writes: \" what an inspirational story. One of the most fulfilling things that can happen to you as a parent is to see the values you've worked to instill in your kids start to manifest themselves in their actions — and this one really resonated with me. I hope this young man never loses his desire to help others. And i ' m going to continue doing whatever i can to make this world a place where he and every young person like him can live up to their full potential. ( and if i ever get to meet him, i hope he ' ll save me an apricot! ) \" given the context of the iranian nuclear deal and obama's mention of possibly meeting the boy, a blogger at vox finds the post particularly \" meaningful. \" ( hillary clinton is also a fan of hony. )",

Instead, parents can rest assured that time on the computer, ipad, or smartphone \" is not evil \" and doesn't have to be \" avoided, \" megan moreno, an adolescent medicine expert at seattle children's hospital and one of the guideline authors, tells usa today. \" it just needs to be balanced with all the other things kids need. \" for example, the aap's new recommendations — announced friday at its annual meeting, per the washington post — note it's ok for babies younger than 18 months to use services such as facetime or skype to bond with family, that those in the 18- to 24-month range can be introduced to shows by their parents ( research shows toddlers may learn words from these programs \" if and only if \" parents watch and engage as well, per npr ), and that kids ages 2 to 5 can enjoy an hour of \" high-quality programming \" from platforms like pbs kids or sesame workshop.

Spring is staring down a $ 2.2 billion cash shortfall next year, and will come up short by $ 5.2 billion the year after as it pays for the millions of iphones it has ordered, and the deal isn't expected to actually turn a profit until at least 2015, the wall street journal reports. At the same time, sprint is going to have to dole out around $ 5 billion to upgrade its network to a 4g standard similar to at&t and verizon. Still, the news wasn't all bad: sprint added 1.3 million new subscribers in the quarter, and posted its smallest quarterly loss — $ 301 million — in four years, the ap reports.

        "summary": "A split jury thursday decided the case of anna alaburda versus the thomas jefferson school of law, and it came down on the side of the school, the san diego union-tribune reports. Alaburda, 37, sued the nonprofit california school in 2011, claiming it fudged post-graduation employment numbers. She said those figures lured her to attend, but she ended up with excess of $ 150,000 in student debt and without a job, even though she graduated near the top of her 2008 class and passed the bar on her first try. The jury rejected her suit's claims with a 9-3 vote, with at least one juror noting alaburda's decision to turn down a law firm's 2008 job offer swayed his decision. She said she rejected the job because she believed it to be a predatory firm that took advantage of consumers; she still hasn't found a full-time salaried position as a lawyer. Prominent among alaburda's arguments was a us news and world report ranking of law schools that placed thomas jefferson's grad employment rate around the same as other law schools, claiming more than 80 % of its grads found jobs within nine months, per the new york times. But the jobs it counted included those not tied to the study of law, including work in salons, restaurants, or even selling tractors — a data-compilation process one juror called \" appalling, \" per the union-tribune. However, the stats were correct in the 2004 and 2005 editions alaburda had read, and the judge advised the jury to consider only those editions. The school's lawyer conceded \" isolated mistakes \" and \" clerical errors \" with the school's data collection but noted there was no evidence the school actually lied, the ap reports.",

And almost half of the companies reviewed for the report had workers who tapped into such apps — and then used the same phone at work, opening up their employers to cyberissues as well. \" your contacts list … your stored images. [ hackers ] can actually also potentially access features on the device — so your camera, your microphone, even your gps location, \" says the security intelligence director of ibm security, per cbs new york. How likely ( and incredibly creepy ) is that? the report reveals 73 % of top dating apps can tell your past and present gps locations, while 34 % can get into your camera. Which means, on a not-so-romantic front, that hackers can possibly stalk your daily activity, scroll through images, and even take over your dating profile, ibm's security intelligence notes. And if the electronic intruders can hijack your camera and mic, they can potentially spy on business meetings and access sensitive company data on your phone. Ibm says it doesn't want to discourage people from using the apps, but it preaches some common-sense tips: don't give out too much personal info on dating sites, don't ignore the security updates and patches your phone occasionally asks you to make, and mix up your passwords for all online accounts and email addresses.

Orbeso's actions remain under investigation. A sheriff's spokesperson tells the los angeles times a gun was recovered at the scene. The couple was reported missing july 28 when they failed to return to a bed-and-breakfast, whose owner believed they went hiking in the park where temperatures topped 100 degrees. A huge search effort failed to find them. A small team found the bodies sunday in a steep canyon. Police said the bodies were found locked in an embrace, and orbeso's father emailed a statement to the southern california news group earlier this week saying, \" i want joseph to be remembered as a kind, caring and thoughtful person.

But they ' ll have to work for it, he writes in an opinion piece for the wall street journal, because \" you can't get something for nothing. \" maranto talks about differing viewpoints on teacher pay: liberals think this woman-dominated field remains underpaid, populists think teachers do just fine as is with their pensions and working conditions, and a third group thinks wages should only be raised for certain teachers in specialized subjects or low-income areas, where there are teacher shortages. But maranto thinks all of these philosophies are \" inadequate, \" and he instead lobbies for greater pay — \" but only in exchange for real reforms to improve teacher quality. \" by his measure, higher pay means a 40 % raise that would put teachers ' wages ( currently at a median $ 58,000 ) above that of accountants ( $ 68,000 ) and on par with civil engineers ( $ 84,000 ), which would attract \" brainy people \" who might otherwise go to college for more lucrative careers. But maranto thinks that teacher certification should be more rigid and that schools should be more easily able to fire low-performing teachers — \" just as medical practices and law firms can fire ineffective doctors and lawyers. \" he acknowledges teacher unions won't be happy about that, and there's always the fear of rogue principals firing away at will, but he offers a gentle reminder: \" nearly all principals are former teachers.

            "As usual, the politics of education lately seem like they're all about the grown-ups. Teachers unions hope their walkouts in states like arizona, kentucky and oklahoma will turn red states blue in 2018, while others foresee a backlash against double-digit pay raises for public employees. But behind the political machinations are deeply held views about teacher compensation. For liberals, higher pay is a matter of social justice. Teachers make less than most other college graduates, reflecting the low status society affords...",
            "According to the most recent population survey released by the u.s. Bureau of labor, the teaching gender gap is still alive and well. Male educators constitute just 2.3 % of pre-k and kindergarten teachers, 18.3 % of the elementary and middle school teacher population, and 42 % of the high school level teaching staff. These numbers are down from 2007, but suggest a clear female majority in the teaching profession, especially in the earlier grades. So why are male teachers still few-and-far-between in the united states? according to expert analysis, the most readily apparent answer is that sexism and status deter men from entering the teaching field. Girls have increasingly been encouraged to engage in typically male-dominated fields, like math and science in recent years, but boys have been given almost no incentive to engage in female-dominated professions, like education. As pointed out by robert m. Cappuozzo, an early childhood education professor at the university of alaska-anchorage, \"we don't give boys the same opportunities that we give girls. \" because of this discrepancy, boys might be disinclined to consider a career in teaching. There's also a disappointing stigma attached to male teachers who teach the earlier grades. According to jeffrey m. Daitsman, a researcher at the center for practitioner researcher at national-louis university, male teachers responsible for younger students are accused of being \"not masculine. \" the stereotype encourages the thinking that, because male teachers are supposed to be disciplinarians, male teachers are \"not masculine \" for wanting to teach younger children who are not often heavily disciplined. In addition to sexism, men are often deterred from teaching because of the pay associated with being an educator.

            "As usual, the politics of education lately seem like they're all about the grown-ups. Teachers unions hope their walkouts in states like arizona, kentucky and oklahoma will turn red states blue in 2018, while others foresee a backlash against double-digit pay raises for public employees. But behind the political machinations are deeply held views about teacher compensation. For liberals, higher pay is a matter of social justice. Teachers make less than most other college graduates, reflecting the low status society affords...",
            "According to the most recent population survey released by the u.s. Bureau of labor, the teaching gender gap is still alive and well. Male educators constitute just 2.3 % of pre-k and kindergarten teachers, 18.3 % of the elementary and middle school teacher population, and 42 % of the high school level teaching staff. These numbers are down from 2007, but suggest a clear female majority in the teaching profession, especially in the earlier grades. So why are male teachers still few-and-far-between in the united states? according to expert analysis, the most readily apparent answer is that sexism and status deter men from entering the teaching field. Girls have increasingly been encouraged to engage in typically male-dominated fields, like math and science in recent years, but boys have been given almost no incentive to engage in female-dominated professions, like education. As pointed out by robert m. Cappuozzo, an early childhood education professor at the university of alaska-anchorage, \"we don't give boys the same opportunities that we give girls. \" because of this discrepancy, boys might be disinclined to consider a career in teaching. There's also a disappointing stigma attached to male teachers who teach the earlier grades. According to jeffrey m. Daitsman, a researcher at the center for practitioner researcher at national-louis university, male teachers responsible for younger students are accused of being \"not masculine. \" the stereotype encourages the thinking that, because male teachers are supposed to be disciplinarians, male teachers are \"not masculine \" for wanting to teach younger children who are not often heavily disciplined. In addition to sexism, men are often deterred from teaching because of the pay associated with being an educator. Many men feel the traditional pressure of being the \"breadwinner, \" and teaching is not known for being a lucrative profession. Bryan g. Nelson, the head of the minneapolis-based nonprofit, menteach, says, \"if we started paying elementary teachers $ 150,000 a year, we'd see a massive influx of male teachers. \" further, as the call for education reform grows louder, teaching is proving to a very challenging profession.

        "summary": "Microsoft unveiled its long-awaited next-generation xbox today, touting more than anything its bevy of advanced entertainment features, calling it an \" all-in-one system for games, movies, and entertainment, \" and announcing an exclusive, live-action halo tv show produced by steven spielberg. Here's what you need to know, drawn from techcrunch, the guardian, and other sources. The system will be called the \" xbox one, \" rather than the 720 as many supposed. Xbox one will \" talk to all of the devices in your living room, \" says a microsoft exec, allowing you to seamlessly and instantly switch between tv, games, skype calls, and web browsing, and even integrate the two if you want to, say, browse the internet while watching tv. The new system will incorporate voice commands and gesture controls. The new kinect gesture controls will be so precise that they know when you've turned your wrist or shifted your weight. It can even read your heartbeat, \" which is helpful? scary? you decide, \" quips the guardian. The system will include a voice-controlled tv guide that won't require you to remember station numbers ever again; just ask xbox what's on hbo or espn, then tell it to change to those channels. Speaking of espn, microsoft announced an exclusive partnership with the nfl, with roger goodell making an appearance. \" you're going to change football in a way that is so dramatic, \" he said. One example: while watching games, you ' ll be able to see your fantasy scores updated onscreen in realtime. The other major celebrity appearance: steven spielberg. \" for me, the halo universe is the perfect place to be at the intersection of where technology and myth-making meet, \" he said. New game-related features include a \" dedicated game dvr \" that will capture everything you do and allow you to easily share impressive accomplishments. Beyond that, there was precious little talk of games, though they did show off a new call of duty game. One of its core new features: a dog companion that was built by performing motion capture on an actual dog, usa today reports. Microsoft promised more game talk at e3. The xbox will run on a new architecture that's like three \" operating systems in one, \" namely the xbox system, windows, and a third that connects the two. The downside? it won't be able to run games from earlier xbox consoles, the verge reports.",

Britain's archbishop of canterbury has admonished christians for their failure to overcome their \" disgust \" of homosexuality. The church of england is in a \" tangle \" over the issue of homosexuality, the archbishop admitted in his most frank comments to date on the issue, reports the telegraph. \" what's frustrating is that we still have christian people whose feelings about it are so strong, and sometimes so embarrassed and ashamed and disgusted, that that just sends out a message of unwelcome, of lack of understanding, of lack of patience, \" archbishop rowan williams told a group of teenagers at an event at his official residence. Williams, who's stepping down from his post at the end of the year, added: \" we're used to being alongside people who are gay; many of our friends may be — indeed we may be — wrestling with that issue ourselves, and the church is scratching its head and trying to work out where it is on all that. \" he also pointed to divisive attitudes in his church about appointing female bishops, which he said gives the impression that sex is \" the only thing the church is interested in. \" the apparent support for gay acceptance came just weeks after the church and williams sternly warned the government not to legalize same-sex marriage because it would \" alter the intrinsic nature of marriage as the union of a man and a woman, as enshrined in human institutions throughout history, \" according to a church statement. Many believed williams would strongly support gay rights as head of the anglicans, but he has turned out to be generally more interested in preserving unity within the church than in fighting for controversial positions, notes the guardian.",

        "summary": "Fifty years after it was seized by north korea, the uss pueblo is the only us navy ship held captive by a foreign government. And though mostly forgotten in the united states, the \" pueblo incident \" for north korea remains a potent symbol of military success. The spy ship, attacked and captured 50 years ago this week, sits in the frozen potong river on the edge of the sprawling \" victorious fatherland liberation war museum \" complex in central pyongyang, the ap reports. Amid an escalating flow of rhetorical attacks on washington for allegedly trying to sour north-south relations ahead of next month's winter olympics, north korea's state-run media have played up the anniversary as a milestone in the country's struggle against the us. The pueblo was ill-equipped for the fight it got on jan. 23, 1968. One us sailor was killed when the ship was strafed by machine gun fire and boarded. The 82 survivors were taken prisoner. The us sent carriers to the sea of japan and demanded the captives be released. North korea, for its part, forced members of the crew, who say they were beaten frequently, to make public confessions. Former pow stu russell says their treatment worsened when their captors realized the meaning of the middle finger gesture they had been making when forced to pose for propaganda photos. The incident came to an end and the crew members were freed on dec. 23, 1968, after maj. Gen. Gilbert h. Woodward, the chief us negotiator, signed a statement acknowledging that the pueblo had \" illegally intruded into the territorial waters of north korea. \"",

The fact that 98 % uploaded photos of their baby to facebook wasn't surprising. What interested researchers, however, was that those who posted photos and updates most often felt pressure to be a perfect mom, sought validation, and considered motherhood to be an important part of their identity, reports mashable. A key indicator was using a baby photo as a profile picture — which almost 80 % of study participants did. These women \" felt validated when they got a lot of ' likes ' and comments, but they were also more likely to feel bad and disappointed when the reaction wasn't what they had hoped, \" a researcher explains in a release. Sounds pretty harmless, right? well, those same women were also more likely to experience \" elevated levels of depressive symptoms \" like restless sleep and a low appetite nine months after giving birth, co-author sarah schoppe-sullivan tells wosu. That doesn't mean new moms should steer clear of facebook, which can help them find advice and support. But if a woman \" doesn't get all the ' likes ' and positive comments she expects, that could be a problem. She may end up feeling worse, \" schoppe-sullivan says. Because the study focused on highly educated working women who were predominantly white and married, the results might not be universal.

Investigators previously concluded the malaysia airlines flight was shot down on july 17, 2014, by a missile launched by a russian-made buk missile system moved into territory held by moscow-backed rebels in ukraine, then returned to russia, per the guardian. The joint investigation team's latest report is the first to directly link the missile system to russian armed forces. Specifically, investigator wilbert paulissen of the dutch national police says photo and video evidence traces the buk — which has \" unique characteristics \" that \" served as a type of fingerprint \" — to the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade in kursk, western russia, reports the telegraph. It is \" legal and convincing evidence which will stand in a courtroom, \" investigators say, with paulissen noting \" all the vehicles in a convoy carrying the missile were part of the russian armed forces, \" per reuters. But though investigators are focused on several dozen possible suspects, down from more than 100, they say it's too early to bring charges. Per the guardian, any eventual trial will be held in the netherlands, from which two-thirds of victims hailed, as russia, denying involvement, has vetoed an international tribunal at the un. Meanwhile, family members of australian victims have penned an open letter to russians ahead of june's world cup. \" we are painfully aware of the dark irony that the russian leaders who will profess to welcome the world with open arms are those who are chiefly to blame for shattering our world, \" it reads, per abc australia.",

        "summary": "Fake reviews are a known problem online — but new york has managed to crack down on them using an equally fake yogurt shop. After a yearlong investigation, new york attorney general eric schneiderman this week announced that the state has reached settlements with 19 companies; they ' ll stop with the bogus reviews and pay $ 350,000 in fines. Those companies fall into two buckets: businesses that are unhappy with their review ratings on sites like yelp, and businesses that help those companies by delivering fake reviews ( a process bloomberg notes is called \" astroturfing \" ). The fake reviews were sometimes written by foreigners for as little as a dollar a pop; other times actual customers were bribed with gift certificates to pen them. In the case of the new york sting ( \" operation clean turf \" ), schneiderman's investigators got things going by pretending to be the owner of a brooklyn yogurt shop in need of some review fluffing; they contacted seo shops looking for help. That led them to the 19 companies. The new york times reports that dentists, lawyers, and an ultrasound clinic were among the businesses buying fake reviews. \" when you look at a billboard, you can tell it's a paid advertisement — but on yelp or citysearch, you assume you're reading authentic consumer opinions, \" says schneiderman.

The attorney general's office said today that 19 companies involved in producing bogus reviews will also pay $ 350,000 in penalties. An undercover probe dubbed \"operation clean turf \" turned up evidence that the companies were paid by local businesses to flood the internet with comments on websites including yelp, google local and citysearch, the office said. \"'astroturfing ' is the 21st century's version of false advertising, and prosecutors have many tools at their disposal to put an end to it, \" schneiderman said in a statement. The companies were also accused of violating state laws against deceptive business practices. Online reviews can have a dramatic effect on local businesses, university of california, berkeley economists found in a 2011 study.

Vice's munchies reports that organizers for the fest — which takes place in august and will this year include the likes of alice cooper, marilyn manson, and megadeth, plus dozens of other performers — are investing in imbibing infrastructure by installing an underground pipeline to bring in 105,000 gallons of beer to the concert site. Thanks to the new quaffing conduit, bartenders will be able to draw six beers per second, the local notes, serving more than 75,000 thirsty music-lovers expected to attend the fest. The event website explains that providing beer to the masses at previous festivals involved the unwieldy process of rolling full barrels through the fields beforehand, then taking out the empty ones, which \" caused a lot of avoidable traffic. \" the pipeline, which is expected to cost around $ 1.1 million, will eliminate that congestion, as well as ease \" bottlenecks \" at the drink serving station. A new drainage system will be installed as well, which will ensure no giant puddles if it rains — though fest founder holger huebner tells the local there will still be plenty of mud for concertgoers to frolic in. Event organizers say in a statement they consider the system a \" lasting investment, \" as the festival takes place annually. Both fresh water and wastewater will also flow through the pipeline system, with the site noting that \" of course we will control the hygiene of the tubes all the time. \" ( ukrainian authorities busted a bootleg-booze pipeline. )",

Whitehouse.gov was inundated with more than 10,000 responses, and #40dollars soon topped twitter's trending chart, david plouffe boasted in an email. Many respondents spoke of gas money, grocery bills, and health care costs. \"$ 40 less a paycheck means i will have to pick between my insulin and the water bill, \" said one response highlighted on whitehouse.gov. Others were sillier; one respondent said it meant \"40 hot wheels mainline cars. \" the white house blog post says the campaign is aimed at an obstructing house. But in an op-ed in usa today, john boehner today paints obama as his ally, since like obama, he wants the payroll tax cut extended a full year.

Trump made the claim while discussing the florida recount with the daily caller, along with his belief that broward county elections supervisor brenda snipes should be fired ( more on that here, here and here ). The full transcript of the interview shows the president also brought up california before making his disguise statement, so it wasn't clear which state he meant when he said this: \" the republicans don't win and that's because of potentially illegal votes, which is what i've been saying for a long time. I have no doubt about it. And i've seen it, i've had friends talk about it when people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It's really a disgrace what's going on. The disgrace is that, voter id.

The new york times reports that thousands of ballots may be disqualified due to signature mismatches, though us district judge mark walker on thursday extended a deadline on that.

        "summary": "The opposition party led by aung san suu kyi sounds very confident after elections that the independent describes as the freest in burma's history. Her national league for democracy party is expected to make huge gains after sunday's vote in the country's first free national election in 25 years, and numerous candidates from the ruling, military-backed union solidarity and development party have already admitted defeat, the bbc reports. \" i think you all have the idea of the results, \" suu kyi told cheering supporters on monday morning, though it's not clear whether the party will have the two-thirds majority in the country's parliament needed to form a government, reports reuters. The election comes after decades of struggle by suu kyi, including 15 years under house arrest, but though she has said she wants to become president, the constitution bars her from the position because her two sons hold british nationality, the bbc notes. Us secretary of state john kerry praised the election as a \" testament to the courage and sacrifice shown by the people of burma over many decades \" while also describing the vote as \" far from perfect \" due to the disfranchisement of groups like the muslim rohingya minority and the reservation of seats in parliament for the military, reports the guardian.",

A report from ming-chi kuo of kgi securities — dubbed \" the king of apple analysts \" by mashable — predicts apple will end production of the iphone x after shipping 18 million devices in the first quarter of 2018, per appleinsider. If confirmed — and \" kuo is almost always accurate when it comes to apple's plans, \" per bgr — the decision would mark the first time apple has opted to kill an iphone before its first birthday. Why the change? kuo first blamed poor sales in china. In a second report obtained by macrumors, he also cites fears that the iphone x, offered at a reduced price, would hurt sales of new apple devices this fall. An analysis from canalys finds the iphone x performed \" slightly below industry expectations \" over the last three months of 2017, per venturebeat. Still, mashable reports kuo's second explanation makes the most sense: if apple were to slash the price of the iphone x by $ 150 ( as it has with other year-old models ), that $ 849 phone might tempt buyers away from a second-generation 5.8-inch iphone x and a 6.5-inch iphone x plus rumored to be offered this fall starting at $ 999. More likely, though, it would affect sales of a rumored 6.1-inch iphone starting at $ 799. Apple will be pushing this phone over the iphone x as it's expected to include a cheaper lcd screen, reports mashable, suggesting $ 849 might be too good a deal for the iphone x's components, including an oled screen.",

The case has been in what the denver post calls \" a kind of cocoon \" since soon after the 27-year-old killed 12 people and injured 70 others during a midnight showing of the dark knight rises, but the public will learn much more about it in the days, weeks, and months to come as evidence sealed so jurors wouldn't hear about it elsewhere finally sees the light of day. \" we will understand if there was a mental disorder. We ' ll have a much better understanding of what he is thinking and what he is believing, \" university of denver psychologist dr. Neil gowensmith tells the post, though he warns that the big question of why holmes carried out such a horrific act may never be fully answered. Holmes has been charged with 164 counts of murder and attempted murder — two for each person killed or injured. His attorneys do not dispute that he carried out the shooting, but, over what is expected to be a harrowing trial lasting four months or more, they're expected to argue that the graduate student was insane, meaning he should be committed to a psychiatric hospital indefinitely instead of executed, the ap reports. \" obviously, this defendant is not normal. Obviously, he has mental health issues. The question is: does it rise to the level of insanity under colorado law? could he tell right from wrong? \" a former chief deputy district attorney in denver tells nbc news.
