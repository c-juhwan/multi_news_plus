        "summary": "Radiohead has announced a new world tour that kicks off may 20. A ninth album is said to be forthcoming. On saturday, some fans received cryptic postcards with only the words: \" sing the song of sixpence that goes / burn the witch / we know where you live, \" a move that mashable is calling \" totally not creepy at all. \" and now the band's online presence was on sunday whited out facebook post by facebook post and tweet by tweet, reports the telegraph, with a white official website, no explanation, and a \" no comment \" from a rep. That has left the internet swirling with excited rumors about how this could all be the epic introduction of the band's next album; it would be the first since the king of limbs was released in 2011. A few clues to note: reddit has pointed out that the postcard appears to reference the german folk holiday walpurgisnacht, or witches ' night, which stereogum reports falls on either april 30 or may 1. The band also created dawnnchoruss ltd. Earlier this year ( it created new companies before the release of its two most recent albums as well ), and reddit also notes the \" annual international dawn chorus day is held on the first sunday in may. \" \" burn the witch \" could well be one of the tracks on the new album; the band began to tease fans with chords from it as far back as 2006, reports pitchfork. Either way, radiohead has been intent for years on releasing albums online, by itself, with little fanfare. Vulture calls it \" anti-viral marketing, \" and the disappearing act suggests a new album is \" imminent. \" still, the so-called disappearing act has certainly gone viral. ( radiohead dropped its last album a day early. )",

        "summary": "Academic achievements are held in high regard in russia. And thousands of russians, including plenty of politicians, judges, and other public officials, submit doctoral dissertations each year. But that doesn't mean it's a country full of intellectuals. Instead, academic status — or, at least, the means to academic status — is a commodity that can fetch thousands of dollars on the black market. It is common for \" would-be academics \" in russia to hire ghostwriters to draft their dissertations ( buy one here ) and then bribe academic boards to accept them, writes leon neyfakh in a lengthy slate article. About 4 % of those dissertations include plagiarism, says activist group dissernet, which uses software to compare dissertations with previously published work. When the software flags a dissertation, it gets a closer look by a human. ( even vladimir putin has been accused of plagiarism. ) so far, per neyfakh, dissernet has identified about 5,600 suspected plagiarists. ( after jumping from 15,000 to 30,000 between 1993 and 2005, the number of dissertations submitted each year dropped to 16,500 in 2014. ) in january, dissernet reported that one out of nine members of russia's duma legislative body \" has a suspect or blatantly fake degree, \" per pri. Sometimes, neyfakh writes, the fraud is \" comic in its brazenness and absurdity. \" take, for instance, the duma member who allegedly adapted someone's dissertation on the chocolate industry to one about meat by simply swapping out the word \" chocolate \" with \" beef. \" a dissernet founder says the group just wants people to care about academic fraud. But that may not be so easy. Just a small number of officials have been forced out of their jobs because of fraudulent dissertations. After all, \" cheating is a national sport and a source of pride, \" russian writer diana bruk opines in esquire. ( is russia training dolphins to kill? )",

But neither the government's safety agency nor the automaker apparently recognized at the time how broad the dangers would turn out to be. During a little-noticed 2007 inquiry, investigators found that at least three of every 100 lexus es 350 owners in ohio reported experiencing unintended acceleration, an unacceptably high percentage given the potentially fatal consequences, industry experts said. \" anything over 1 percent would raise a red flag, particularly for the manufacturer, \" said james c. Fell, who worked at the national highway traffic safety administration for 30 years, and was chief of research for traffic safety programs. The investigation opened formally in august 2007, one of the few times nhtsa commenced a full-fledged investigation into reports of toyotas accelerating unexpectedly. More often, the inquiries have ended at the \" preliminary evaluation \"",

Photograph: everett kennedy brown/epa toyota will suffer $ 2bn ( £ 1.26bn ) in extra costs as a result of a global safety recall affecting millions of cars, and faces a bruising few months ahead as it attempts to address safety concerns that could result in civil action by authorities in the us. In the only glimmer of good news at the end of a disastrous week, the world's biggest carmaker raised its annual forecast to an ¥ 80bn profit ( £ 550m ), a dramatic reversal from its previous estimates of a ¥ 200bn loss. Last year the company suffered a ¥ 436bn loss as it fell victim to a global slump in demand sparked by the recession.

            "Detroit  no sooner had toyota dealerships begun to repair accelerator pedals on millions of recalled vehicles than the carmaker said it was considering yet another major recall, this time for problems with the brakes on its prius hybrid. Safety regulators in washington said thursday that they would open an investigation into the brakes on the 2010 prius, which had been spared from the recall lists. The announcement was made hours after toyota acknowledged that it had identified a flaw in the car's antilock braking system and corrected it for priuses built since late january. The car was redesigned for the 2010 model year. Prius drivers have complained that the car momentarily loses the ability to brake when driven over a pothole or other uneven surface. Toyota said the issue was a result of the antilock brakes'trying to maintain tire traction. Officials in japan also said friday that the carmaker was looking into the"

Romney has raised $ 4.6 million in the 24 hours since the ruling came down, his press secretary tweeted this morning. What's more, the campaign says it came from more than 47,000 individual donors — which, the atlantic points out, is a big change for a campaign that so far has largely tried to woo big-money donors. Both campaigns used the ruling as an excuse to pump supporters for donations, cnn reports. Romney's campaign sent emails and texts, and even changed its homepage to say, \" obamacare upheld: elections have consequences, \" over a giant \" donate \" button. Obama's campaign sent out an email entitled \" let's win the damn election. \" \" this is a three-step process, \" campaign manager jim messina wrote. Step 1, pass reform. Step 2, defend it in court. \" step 3? win the damn election. \" but obama's campaign hasn't revealed its total take post-ruling.",

Dutch researchers found that people with depression seem to be aging faster, with the upshot being that they lose four to six years, reports cbs news. They reached the conclusion by measuring cell structures called telomeres, and healthday news explains the rationale: \" like the plastic tips at the ends of shoelaces, telomeres cap the ends of chromosomes to protect the cell's dna from damage. Telomeres get a bit shorter each time a cell divides, so they are useful markers for aging. \" as it turns out, people who have or had depression also have shorter telomeres. \" results like ours suggest that psychological distress, as experienced by depressed persons, has a large, detrimental impact on the ' wear and tear ' of a person's body, resulting in accelerated biological aging, \" says the study's author. The researchers don't know whether depression causes the shorter telomeres, only that they're associated with the condition, notes livescience.

They naturally become shorter and weaker over time, leading the cell to age faster and die. Researchers looked at almost 1,100 people who were currently diagnosed with major depressive disorder ( mdd ) or clinical depression, 802 people who had previously been diagnosed with mdd and 510 who never had the psychological issue.

Normally, telomeres shorten slightly each time cells divide, and their length is thought to be an index of a cell's aging. The researchers found telomeres were shorter in people who had experienced depression compared with people in the control group.

The last of it will be buried in the 2120s, and the tunnels will be permanently sealed. After 100,000 years, the nuclear waste will no longer be radioactive or dangerous. But that's a lot of time to plan for ( 100,000 years ago, finland was covered in ice and neanderthals ruled europe ). To prevent radioactive materials from leaking, the waste will be sealed in iron casts, then into copper canisters, then into clay. The capsules will be buried 1,380 feet underground in the tunnels, which will then be filled with more clay. Experts say the nuclear waste will be safe from water, ice, and shifting rocks. The project is expected to cost $ 4 billion. And while greenpeace and others are concerned about safety, neighbors in olkiluoto seem to be ok with it. \" personally, i believe that when [ the waste ] is placed deep down there with care and expertise, it is better than how it is now around the world — placed wherever, \" a vegetable farmer tells afp. ( the rest of the world's nuclear waste could find a home in the australian outback. )",

The canisters will be lodged into a network of tunnels cut out of granite bedrock 400 metres underground; the canisters will be packed in with clay. Once the facility is sealed — which finnish authorities estimate will be in 2120 — it should safely isolate the waste for several hundred thousand years. By then, its radiation levels will be harmless. Where do other countries put their spent nuclear fuel? most nations store it above",

Per people chica, ab quintanilla — full name: abraham quintanilla, per a facebook post by the nueces county sheriff's office — is one of the top 10 fugitives in corpus christi for the month of august, with a warrant out for his arrest for contempt of court and unpaid child support. The 53-year-old quintanilla — a musician who used to perform with his younger sister's group, selena y los dinos, and who more recently founded los kumbia kings and elektro kumbia — is said to have six sons and two daughters. Kztv reports he owed close to $ 90,000 as of july, per court documents. Quintanilla was nailed in 2015 for only making a handful of payments over four years and ordered by a nueces county court in august of that year to make nearly $ 37,000 in back payments and interest, notes the san antonio express-news. It's unclear how much, if any, he paid up toward that figure, though kris notes that paperwork from the texas attorney general's office indicates the last payment he made was in september 2015, for $ 16.84. For those wondering how he ended up on a \" most wanted \" list with other felons sought for assault and indecency with children, among other crimes, the corpus christi caller-times details the sheriff's office criteria.

If there is such a thing as ideal circumstances for choking, they're probably these: the incident happened during dinner on monday after a medical symposium, so many top physicians — including cdc chief dr. Thomas frieden — were in the room when pauline larwood, a former county supervisor, started choking at a table ( kbak-kbfx reports that a piece of steak was the culprit ). The heimlich maneuver didn't work, so dr. Royce johnson — a professor of medicine at ucla and the chief of infectious diseases at a local hospital — sprang into action. He borrowed a friend's pocket knife, made an incision in the 71-year-old's throat, and inserted a pen casing to use as a breathing tube. Frieden and dr. Paul krogstad, another ucla medical professor, monitored her pulse and breathing. It worked — before the ambulance had even arrived, larwood was reportedly sitting up and talking. The tracheotomy was \" a pretty drastic measure, \" says krogstad, but \" everyone knew what they were doing. \"",

Among those in seating reserved for guests and family members of conservative justice john roberts will be his cousin jean podrasky, who wants to marry her female partner of four years. \" he is a smart man, \" she tells the los angeles times. \" he is a good man. I believe he sees where the tide is going. I do trust him. I absolutely trust that he will go in a good direction. \" the lesbian couple at the heart of the proposition 8 case, kris perry and sandy stier, will be in the court tomorrow when lawyer ted olson tries to persuade the court that california's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional, a move that would open the door to gay marriages nationwide. In an interview with the ap, they note that, with the youngest two of four boys they've raised together headed for college, life has often been more about being soccer moms than gay rights activists. Still, \" i hope this will be something a lot bigger than the two of us, \" says perry. Dozens of people stood in line in front of the court over the weekend in a bid to get seats for the historic cases. Many, however, were being paid by one of several companies that charge hefty sums to secure places in line for big cases, the new york times finds. Critics say the existence of such services strengthens the argument for allowing supreme court proceedings to be televised.",

Almost two-thirds of bermudans who voted in a 2016 referendum rejected same-sex marriage, though the result was declared invalid because turnout was below 50 %. Under the new law, same-sex bermudan couples will be offered domestic partnerships that give them similar rights to married couples. \" the act is intended to strike a fair balance between two currently irreconcilable groups in bermuda, by restating that marriage must be between a male and a female while at the same time recognizing and protecting the rights of same-sex couples, \" says minister of home affairs walton brown.

Four survivors reach the safety of our hotel the first projectile hit the sea wall of gaza city's little harbour just after four o ' clock. As the smoke from the explosion thinned, four figures could be seen running, ragged silhouettes, legs pumping furiously along the wall. Even from a distance of 200 metres, it was obvious that three of them were children. Jumping off the harbour wall, they turned on to the beach, attempting to cross the short distance to the safety of the al-deira hotel, base for many of the journalists covering the gaza conflict.

        "summary": "An investigation into a military plane crash in spain last month is in the early stages, but investigators already have a theory as to what went wrong: computer data that control the airbus a400m military carrier's turboprop engines had accidentally been wiped from the system. The files — called \" torque calibration parameters \" — are installed on an engine's computer and interpret sensor readings on an engine's torque, adjusting the speed of the propellers accordingly. Without the data, an engine can't run as the propellers turn too slowly, reports the bbc. During the plane's first test flight on may 9, three of the four engines froze shortly after takeoff. Four of six on board died in the crash. Sources tell reuters the data was unintentionally removed while software was being installed at an airbus facility. Safety checks failed to notice the problem, and pilots were only alerted when they reached 400 feet in the air. The plane, which cost $ 22.5 billion to develop, was designed in 2009 to inform pilots of an issue at such a height, rather than on the ground, partly because the likelihood of a failure was small. That system was again approved last year. \" nobody imagined a problem like this could happen to three engines, \" a source says.

        "summary": "The two civilians killed in friday's attack on a planned parenthood clinic have been identified as an iraq war veteran and a mother of two, both of whom were at the colorado springs, colo., clinic to support friends. Jennifer markovsky, 35, was a stay-at-home mom who \" lived for her kids, \" her sister-in-law tells the colorado springs gazette. She grew up in hawaii and moved to colorado with her husband, who is in the military. The other victim named on sunday, 29-year-old ke ' arre stewart, was an iraq war veteran and the father of two girls, the gazette reports. Stewart, who grew up in texas, \" was caring, giving, funny, and just a damn good person, \" a friend writes on a gofundme page set up to help his family. The third person killed in the attack was identified saturday as 44-year-old university of colorado at colorado springs officer garrett swasey, who, like the other two victims, had two children. At a sunday service at the hope chapel, where he was a co-pastor, he was described as a devoted husband and father as well as a dedicated police officer and an accomplished figure skater, the washington post reports. In other developments: regional planned parenthood chief vicki cowart gave more details of the attack on abc's this week, the ap reports. Cowart — who says hateful speech directed at the organization has contributed to attacks — said none of the clinic's 15 employees were injured and that the gunman never made it past a locked door to the main clinic area. The nine people injured in the attack include five police officers, the ap notes. More details about the alleged gunman, 57-year-old robert lewis dear, also emerged on sunday, though police haven't discussed a motive. Dear, who apparently moved from north carolina to colorado last year, has been described as a loner who handed out anti-government pamphlets. His relatives, including his mother and at least some of his four children and three ex-wives, live in the charleston, sc, area and have been reluctant to talk to journalists, the post reports. Dear, who reportedly said \" no more baby parts \" after his arrest, will appear in court today and could end up facing federal charges, possibly under the 1994 freedom of access to clinic entrances act, as well as local ones, the ap reports.",

Schapiro criticized him over his planned trip to russia to celebrate victory in moscow in may. \"i cannot image a czech ambassador in washington giving advice to the u.s. President on where he should travel, \" zeman said. \"i will not let any ambassador speak into my plans of foreign trips, \" zeman said. \"i am afraid that after the statement, schapiro's door to the prague castle is closed, \" he added. \"well, mr ambassador will be awfully sorry, \" former foreign minister karel schwarzenberg, chairman of the chamber of deputies foreign committee and leader of the opposition top 09, said with irony. Jaroslav faltýnek, chairman of the deputy group of ano, a member of the coalition government, said zeman had \"overreacted. \" he said on the other hand he agreed that it was not suitable for an ambassador to criticize a head of state. \"i presume that the whole affair will be explained rationally, \" faltýnek said. \"i do not think zeman's decision to discontinue communication with the u.s.

        "summary": "More than four years after his wife's murder in mexico, bruce beresford-redman awaits his fate. The survivor producer's mexican trial for monica burgos ' murder has finally wrapped up after stretching on for nearly three years. Prosecutors argued beresford-redman killed his wife in their room at cancun's moon palace resort on the morning of april 5, 2010, then hid her body in the room until evening, when he deposited it in a cistern, about 75 yards away. The judge's verdict is expected sometime next spring, and beresford-redman could face 30 years in prison if convicted. But as the hollywood reporter explains, the case is hardly cut and dried. Coroner's tale: evidence gathered from burgos ' body doesn't support the prosecution's argument. As her body showed no evidence of lividity — the bluish marks left by exposure to a hard surface, like in a hotel room — a coroner said burgos likely died at the cistern itself. The coroner also determined burgos died at around 11pm on april 5, not that morning. Missing evidence: police didn't complete a rape kit on burgos and didn't test under her fingernails, though the state claimed scratches on beresford-redman's neck indicated a fight. The prosecution later said much of its evidence was \" lost \" or damaged by mold and water. It also turned out that blood samples prosecutors said were taken from the hotel room and a railing outside didn't belong to burgos or beresford-redman. Witnesses recant: hotel employees who said they'd seen the couple fighting later said beresford-redman wasn't the man they'd seen. A worker testified that a british family had complained — in a handwritten note — of a woman's screams coming from the couple's hotel room, but no official statement was ever taken from the family. Expert opinion: a forensic scientist and criminologist hired by beresford-redman's mexican defense attorney said burgos was likely killed by two people familiar with the layout of the hotel. He also found no evidence tying beresford-redman to the crime. An expert for the prosecution and an independent forensic expert brought in by the judge couldn't link him to it either. Beresford-redman is now facing more charges, because mexican officials are upset about a recent 48 hours special in which the producer recorded video diaries revealing, among other things, the \" noisy... Smelly... Sweaty and hot and cramped \" conditions of his life in prison. Click to read more on the case.",

Nikolas cruz's mother in 2016 told investigators that his girlfriend had cheated on him and that she and the girl's mother had encouraged the teens to \" end the relationship because it was unhealthy for everyone. \" why lynda cruz told investigators this in the first place: sheriff's deputies and department of children &amp; family services investigators looked into the teen after he posted images of himself cutting his arms on snapchat in september 2016 and said he wanted to buy a gun. Lynda cruz said her son began cutting himself after the relationship's demise. She told them her son did not have a gun but did have an air gun, though she had taken it from him because he broke her rules regarding where he could shoot it. The sun sentinel quotes from the dcf report: \" mr. Cruz has fresh cuts on both his arms. Mr. Cruz stated he plans to go out and buy a gun. It is unknown what he is buying the gun for. \" cruz didn't purchase his ar-15 for another five months, but the investigation occurred four days after he turned 18 and was legally able to buy a gun. The report's conclusion: \" [ cruz's ] final level of risk is low as [ he ] resides with his mother, attends school and receives counseling through henderson [ mental health in broward county ], \" which had determined he was \" stable enough not to be hospitalized. \" \" every single red flag was being thrown up by this kid, \" says chief assistant public defender gordon weekes.

Elena mahrt, author of a study published monday in current biology, says mice sing ultrasonic songs using a method \" never found before in any animal, \" according to a press release. It has, however, been found in jet engines. Mice use these high-pitched whistles — inaudible to humans — to defend their territory and find mates, but until now scientists had no idea how they made the noises, especially because mice's vocal cords stay absolutely still while producing the \" ultrasound bleeps, \" live science reports. \" mice seem to be doing something very complicated and clever to make ultrasound, \" study coauthor dr. Anurag agarwal says in the press release. To produce the high-pitched song, a jet of air originating in the mouse's windpipe bounces off the inner wall of the larynx and doubles back on itself, making a \" feedback loop. \" this process — discovered in mice using high-speed cameras — has only ever been seen before in jet engines and their ilk. Coauthor coen elemans says it's likely many rodents use this same method, possibly even accounting for the echolocation of bats, according to the telegraph. \" even though mice have been studied so intensely, they still have some cool tricks up their sleeves, \" he says.

        "summary": "Studies on a wide range of species have found that calorie restriction almost always extends lifespan — and this is true in yeast, worms, flies, mice, and more. But whether this applies to primates has been the subject of considerable debate since studies by two highly reputable organizations have reported such different results, reports new scientist. Now, however, those two organizations — the university of wisconsin and the national institute on aging — have come together to dissect the differences, and they conclude in the journal nature communications that calorie restriction does in fact improve both the health and longevity of rhesus monkeys. It turns out the nia's preliminary results, which found no difference in survival rates between the groups, were marred by flaws in study design, including that calorie restriction began in some of the monkeys when they were juveniles, which actually reduces primate lifespan. The trials have been going since the late 1980s, and four of the nia monkeys that began dieting as adults lived past 40 ( typical lifespan tops out at 30 ), breaking any known record for the species. In wisconsin, meanwhile, the calorie-restricted males typically lived two years longer than controls eating whatever they wanted, while calorie-restricted females lived six years longer. Another finding: the university of wisconsin reports that females are less susceptible to the negative effects of excess fat than males. ( people tend to snack less after looking at this. )",

In the 1980s it became clear that adult onset cr ( 12-month-old mice ) was also effective in delaying ageing and extending lifespan in rodents, albeit to a lesser extent than the young onset model22. Many rodent cr studies opt to feed control animals ad libitum amounts of food while others provide less than ad libitum amounts arguing that this strategy avoids the confounding effects of obesity and reduces variability in food intake among individuals. With the launch of the nia rhesus monkey study in 1987, the implementation of cr was such that the control monkeys were not free-fed. Food allotments were determined in accordance with data published by the national research council to provide approximate ad libitum intake based on their age and bodyweight for the maturing control monkeys without overfeeding23.

He said he had a sex encounter with one of those women in 2000, when she was 17, in which she used lotion to masturbate him.

But there's a wrench in the works in the form of gov. Paul lepage, who is defying voters by refusing to adopt the obamacare program and missing paperwork deadlines, reports politico. Lepage has already five times vetoed bills related to the expansion, which would cover an estimated 80,000 low-income maine adults. An expansion funding deal disintegrated last week just as maine's legislative session wrapped up, and it's not clear if lawmakers will address the issue when they come back for a veto session later in the year. Per mainebiz.com, lepage says the expansion would throw maine into a fiscal crisis and that his administration won't give the go-ahead unless lawmakers can guarantee funding without raising taxes or tapping into \" rainy day \" funds, among other conditions. But an article last month in the modern healthcare trade publication cites two recent reports, with one noting medicaid expansion in 31 other states has so far brought about \" negligible or minor \" costs, and the other asserting that the cost is about half of what lepage says it will be. The next step for medicaid expansion proponents in the pine tree state: heading to court. \" the law is clear, \" a rep for advocacy group maine equal justice partners tells politico. \" people will have a right [ to coverage ] and we will represent them in court. \"",

Now that congressional efforts to repeal or replace the affordable care act ( aca ) have abated, the 18 states that have not expanded medicaid can consider whether to do so going forward. The aca's established funding will pay for 90 percent of the costs of expanding medicaid to cover people in households with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level.

On friday, the man tapped to replace her also stepped down — after he was accused of agreeing, or at least sympathizing, with holocaust deniers, reuters reports. According to the telegraph, jean-francois jalkh is said to have praised the research of a holocaust denier as \" well-worked \" and \" rigorous \" in a 2000 interview published in 2005. There are also reports he attended a rally held by supporters of a nazi collaborator in 1991. Jalkh, who denies being a holocaust denier but maintains it would have been \" impossible \" for the nazis to use zyklon b in the gas chambers, plans to file a legal complaint over the accusations, france 24 reports. The sudden attention on jalkh could hurt le pen just over a week out from the second and final round of voting in the french presidential election. Recent polling shows her well behind centrist emmanuel macron, who visited the site of one of the worst nazi atrocities in france on friday. Le pen has been trying to make the national front seem less racist, anti-semitic, and xenophobic than it historically has been — even going so far as to kick her father out of the party he founded after he called the gas chambers a \" detail \" of history. On friday, le pen said she \" abhors \" the theories of holocaust deniers and there is no one in the national front leadership \" who defends this sort of thesis. \"",

As the sepsis alliance puts it, \" your body's immune system, which is supposed to fight off the infection, goes into overdrive and begins to attack your body. \" sepsis can cause tissue damage or multiple organ failure, landed 400,000 medicare beneficiaries in icus across the country in 2013 alone, and plays a role in 33 % to 50 % of all us hospital deaths. It cost $ 5.5 billion for those initial medicare hospitalizations in 2013, yet triggers return visits 40 % of the time. And as far as percentages go, here's another big one: a report based on 2011 data found sepsis \" resulted in an aggregate cost of $ 20.3 billion or 5.2 % \" of what america spent on all hospitalizations that year. Treatment may improve as hospitals create sepsis teams and new prediction tools, as well as investigate treatments; antibiotics and fluids alone can save lives, notes the sepsis alliance, which in 2013 reported only 44 % of americans had ever heard of sepsis. Meanwhile, experts are advising people with symptoms like depression, anxiety, forgetfulness, and weakness to seek faster hospitalization. Root causes include smoking, alcoholism, pollution, and pulmonary problems, a professor told frontline magazine years ago. But problems persist: in canada, hundreds of malpractice cases in recent years involved sepsis, usually over poor diagnosis, the national post reports.

Law died early wednesday in rome following a long illness, the vatican said. Law moved to italy to serve as archpriest of the papal liberian basilica of st.

Related coverage: racism: smerconish played a recording of daughter ensa cosby declaring that \" racism has played a big role \" in the allegations and asked cosby if he agreed, per the daily beast and cnn. \" could be, could be, \" he said. \" i can't say anything, but there are certain things that i look at, and i apply to the situation, and there are so many tentacles.

            "The paradise tree snake undulates mid-flight. Credit: jake socha, virginia tech. The paradise tree snake, c. Paradisi, can glide dozens of meters from tree to tree. Credit: jake socha, virginia tech. The snake dangles 49 feet ( 15 meters ) off the ground, tail entwined around a branch. Suddenly, the animal rears up and launches, flinging its body toward the forest floor. In other reptiles, the leap would be suicidal, or at least an invitation for broken bones. But the snake in question is a chrysopelea paradisi, one of five related species of tree-dwelling snakes from southeast and south asia. When these snakes leap, it's not to nosedive; it's to glide from tree to tree, a feat they can accomplish at distances of at least 79 feet ( 24 m ). What no one knows is exactly how these reptiles manage to fly so far without wings. Now, a new study finds that the snakes ' amazing aerial abilities may all be in the way they move. \" for any flier, you really need to know the basics: how fast is it going, what's the shape of the flier, what is the shape of the wing, \" study author jake socha, a biologist at virginia tech, told livescience. \"",
            "An unusual breed of asian snakes can glide long distances in the air, and the department of defense is funding research at virginia tech to find out why. Most animals that glide do so with fixed wings or a wing-like part. But not the \" flying snakes \" of southeast asia, india and southern china - at least five members of the genus chrysopelea.

            "The paradise tree snake undulates mid-flight. Credit: jake socha, virginia tech. The paradise tree snake, c. Paradisi, can glide dozens of meters from tree to tree. Credit: jake socha, virginia tech. The snake dangles 49 feet ( 15 meters ) off the ground, tail entwined around a branch. Suddenly, the animal rears up and launches, flinging its body toward the forest floor. In other reptiles, the leap would be suicidal, or at least an invitation for broken bones. But the snake in question is a chrysopelea paradisi, one of five related species of tree-dwelling snakes from southeast and south asia. When these snakes leap, it's not to nosedive; it's to glide from tree to tree, a feat they can accomplish at distances of at least 79 feet ( 24 m ). What no one knows is exactly how these reptiles manage to fly so far without wings. Now, a new study finds that the snakes ' amazing aerial abilities may all be in the way they move. \" for any flier, you really need to know the basics: how fast is it going, what's the shape of the flier, what is the shape of the wing, \" study author jake socha, a biologist at virginia tech, told livescience. \"",
            "An unusual breed of asian snakes can glide long distances in the air, and the department of defense is funding research at virginia tech to find out why. Most animals that glide do so with fixed wings or a wing-like part. But not the \" flying snakes \" of southeast asia, india and southern china - at least five members of the genus chrysopelea. As video of the reptiles show, they undulate from side to side, in almost an air-slithering, to create an aerodynamic system. It allows them to travel from the top of the biggest trees in the region ( almost 200 feet high ) to a spot about 780 feet away from the tree's trunk.

The ships faced off as part of the battle of the atlantic; the already damaged u-576 was headed home in 1942 when it spotted 19 merchant ships, including the bluefields, and their five escorts.

When chimpanzees did a comparable test, they were \" hopeless, \" the researcher says; the new york times points out that dogs are generally good at understanding pointing. It's possible that elephants point with their trunks to communicate with each other in the wild; or maybe, as some experts have speculated, they've picked up on human pointing while living in captivity.

Most of them are domesticated mammals, with dogs proving to be especially good at understanding pointing. Photo these results have prompted some researchers to speculate that during domestication, animals evolve to become keenly aware of humans. Others have made a different argument: they propose that the wild ancestors of species like dogs were already keenly aware of each other. In fact, that pre-existing capacity may have made those wild species easy to domesticate. In the mid-2000s, dr. Byrne began to wonder if elephants could pass the pointing test, too.

Andrews tested 11 african elephants on what's known as the object-choice task. In this task, a food reward is hidden in one of several containers and the experimenter signals which one by pointing to it. People understand pointing, even as young children. But the track record of other animals on the object-choice task is mixed. Domesticated animals, such as dogs, cats, and horses, tend to perform better than wild ones. Even our closest relative, the chimpanzee, typically struggles to understand pointing when it's used by human caretakers. What '"

That number might not seem high in the context of the hundreds of thousands of officers who police the nation, but the ap notes that it's definitely a low figure — california and new york, for example, didn't cough up records because neither state has a system to yank badges for such misconduct, while other states reported zero instances despite media reports to the contrary. \" it's happening probably in every law enforcement agency across the country, \" says the sarasota police chief who studied the issue for the international association of chiefs of police. \" it's so underreported and people are scared that if they call and complain about a police officer, they think every other police officer is going to be then out to get them. \" if underreporting and record-keeping are problematic, so, too, is a system that's often lenient on those familiar with it. \" it starts with the officer denying the allegations —'she's crazy, \" she's lying, ' \" says a counselor. \" and the other officers say they didn't see anything, they didn't hear anything. \" the ap highlights the case of oklahoma city officer daniel holtzclaw, who is accused of pulling over a 50-something woman on a bogus traffic stop and forcing her to perform oral sex at gunpoint. She's one of 13 accusers — including a 17-year-old girl who says holtzclaw raped her on her mother's front porch. \" i didn't know what to do, \" she testified. \" like, what am i going to do? call the cops? he was a cop. \" holtzclaw faces 36 counts including rape and forcible oral sodomy at his trial monday.

        "summary": "It turns out all those sunday brunch photos on instagram aren't just pictures, they're data. Or, at least they were for georgia tech researchers looking for a better way to get at the reality of living in a so-called food desert, where access to grocery stores and healthy, affordable food is scant, reports the atlantic. The most common method of assessing the diets of food-desert residents — occasional surveys of \" populations of limited size \" — is hamstrung by its inability to really get at what people are eating day in and day out. Enter munmun de choudhury and her team, who scouted out 3 million geo-tagged instagram photos of food to determine what people are eating. What they found: in what the usda has identified as food deserts, the foods photographed contained 5 % to 17 % more fat, sugar, and cholesterol than those photos from demographically similar non-food deserts. The difference was stark enough that researchers could actually predict whether a given instagram post originated in a food desert 80 % of the time, they report at the 19th acm conference on computer-supported cooperative work and social computing. \" fruits and vegetables are the biggest difference, \" de choudhury says in a release, with 33 % of food desert posts mentioning them, compared to 48 % of non-food desert posts. ( grist floats one solution here, pointing to the success of farmers markets in food deserts, particularly if vendors accept food stamps. ) there was one finding that ran counter to \" popular intuition \": there was no real difference in terms of the number of calories contained in the photographed foods. The study does have limitations, though: photos aren't necessarily representative of typical meals, and a picture cannot reveal the quantity a person will then go on to eat. ( of course, \" healthy \" foods may not be healthy for everyone. )",

        "summary": "Never again will you have to wander a parking lot in search of your vehicle — or so google hopes. A new feature on google maps allows users to record the location of their vehicle by tapping the blue location dot on the map screen and putting a \" p \" icon in its place to work as a signpost. For now, it's available only on android phones, reports mashable. While requiring manual input, the feature improves upon an old google now feature that used phone sensors to guess where you parked. As techcrunch explains, google now couldn't always differentiate between the spot you parked your car and the stop where you got out of a taxi or bus. But google isn't quite ahead of the curve here. This update comes a year after apple maps introduced its parked location feature, which automatically marks a car's location when an iphone is disconnected from bluetooth or carplay. Like apple maps, google maps allows users to add notes and photos, which help you to remember the level and row of your spot in a parking garage, for example. And while it logs only one parking location at a time — a potential issue if you park your car at an airport, then pick up a rental at your destination, per android police — google users can also record time limits when they park in a metered space. The app displays the time remaining, then sends you an alert when it's about to run out. ( it took a man six months to find his parked car. )",

        "summary": "\" a truly sad fluke. \" that's how spokesman richard e. Glover jr. Describes this week's events at the texas state aquarium, where nearly all the fish held in its two largest indoor tanks died following an effort to rid their waters of a \" particularly difficult \" parasite. The los angeles times reports the corpus christi aquarium was battling a parasite that other treatments hadn't been able to vanquish; after testing an unnamed chemical on a smaller pool of water, it was added to four tanks. The aquarium was trying to kill off the trematoda parasite, a class that \" includes two groups of parasitic flatworms, known as flukes. They are internal parasites, \" says glover. Instead, as many as 100 fish died, with kiii news reporting that all but two of the animals that are part of the 125,000-gallon islands of steel exhibit were killed. That exhibit held fish commonly found around an oil platform off texas: nurse sharks, green moray eels, spadefish, amberjack, tarpon, grouper, and even a sand tiger shark, per the aquarium's website. A statement posted on facebook by the aquarium states that the chemical \" is commonly used by many other aquariums in treating similar issues, \" without this result. \" staff members worked diligently throughout the night to save as much of the collection as possible, but considerable losses were sustained. \" the san diego union-tribune describes the post as since transforming into an \" aquatic memorial \" where visitors are recognizing lost favorites — a number of people have referenced a beloved and \" crazy \" grouper.",
