        "summary": "The philadelphia couple who raised more than $ 400,000 for a homeless veteran are using the fund as their \" personal piggy bank, \" lawyers for johnny bobbitt jr. Write in a lawsuit filed tuesday. Though lawyers say bobbitt is staying at a hotel during a third stint in rehab, the 35-year-old marine corps veteran had been back to panhandling and battling a drug addiction on philadelphia's streets despite a generous gofundme campaign organized by kate mcclure, 28, and mark d ' amico, 39. They started the campaign after bobbitt used his last $ 20 to buy gas for a stranded mcclure and later bought a camper in which bobbitt resided on property owned by mcclure's family. Asked to leave in june because of drug use, per the philadelphia inquirer, bobbitt alleges he's received just $ 75,000 of what he's due. Mcclure and d ' amico have interfered, spending more than half of the $ 402,000 raised \" to fund a lifestyle that they could not otherwise afford, \" the lawsuit claims, per abc news. Bobbitt previously wondered at how mcclure, a receptionist, could afford a new bmw. But the couple have said only $ 500 of the fund was improperly spent on gambling and repaid. Noting well over $ 150,000 remains but is being withheld from bobbitt for fear he will spend it on drugs, the couple say they ' ll open the fund to review by an accountant, per the inquirer. Too late, according to bobbitt's lawyers, who say the lawsuit seeking a court-appointed overseer of the account came after d ' amico ignored repeated requests for a full accounting. \" he's really left us with no choice but to go forward, \" one tells the ap. A thursday hearing is set.",

But new owners invested $ 285 million to bring it up to date, and it's expected to stay in business another 40 years. \" we think of fenway as the ' little engine that could, ' and it just keeps chugging along, \" red sox co-owner tom werner says.

She says 15 shell casings were found at the scene, and a.40 caliber handgun recovered from miles ' home proved a match for the bullets that killed goforth. The chronicle reports miles, 30, didn't say much during his appearance, and was dressed in the yellow uniform given to high-profile inmates. He remains in jail without bail. A motive has yet to be given for the shooting. A gofundme campaign for goforth's family ( he has two kids ) today surpassed its $ 100,000 goal.",

        "summary": "The man accused of raping a 15-year-old girl while they were students at a prestigious new hampshire boarding school was found guilty of misdemeanor sexual assault but acquitted of more serious felony charges today, the boston globe reports. The victim claims owen labrie, 18 at the time, forced sexual intercourse on her — ignoring her pleas to stop and fighting to remove her underwear — in the attic of a st. Paul's school building in may 2014. In his defense, labrie, who attended a choir concert following the attack, says the two never had intercourse — he says he started putting a condom on before deciding he didn't want to have sex with the victim — and any sexual contact was consensual, cnn reports. He said it seemed like the victim was \" having a great time. \" during the two-week trial, labrie's friends testified he bragged about having sex with the victim, and prosecutors claimed labrie and his friends were competing to see who could \" slay \" the most girls before graduation, the globe reports. Cnn states the defense attempted to put blame on st. Paul's itself for encouraging a tradition known as \" senior salute, \" in which seniors attempt to have sexual interactions with underclassmen before commencement. The defense claims the school is \" failing \" its students by tolerating senior salute, which it said harmed both its client and the victim. In addition to misdemeanor sexual assault, the jury found labrie guilty of using a computer to lure a minor and endangering the welfare of a child. He was acquitted of felony rape.",

Three doctors from east flanders are being investigated on suspicion of having \" poisoned \" tine nys in 2010. The 38-year-old had been diagnosed with asperger's syndrome two months before she died in an apparently legal killing by a doctor. Sophie nys, one of tine's sisters, told the ap of \" irregularities \" in the process: that the doctor who performed the euthanasia asked her parents to hold the needle in place while he administered the fatal injection, among other fumbling efforts. Afterward, the doctor asked the family to use a stethoscope to confirm that tine's heart had stopped. Last year, the ap reported that after nys ' family filed a criminal complaint, her doctors attempted to block the investigation. \" we must try to stop these people, \" wrote dr. Lieve thienpont, the psychiatrist who approved nys'request to die — and one of the doctors now facing charges. \" it is a seriously dysfunctional, wounded, traumatized family with very little empathy and respect for others. \" nys also alleged that her sister's longtime psychiatrist wouldn't give tine the ok, and that thienpoint did so after as few as two or three sessions with her. Belgium is one of two countries, along with the netherlands, where euthanasia of people for psychiatric reasons — including depression, personality disorder and asperger's — is allowed if they can prove they have \" unbearable and untreatable \" suffering.",

The insiders tell cnn that manafort was initially wiretapped under a secret court order in 2014 in connection with his work as a consultant in ukraine. That investigation was dropped last year, apparently because there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges, the sources say, but the wiretapping resumed under another secret order which, like the first, was issued under the foreign intelligence surveillance act. It isn't clear when the second court order was issued, but the warrant extended until at least early this year, long after manafort parted ways with the trump campaign, the sources say. They say evidence collected suggests manafort encouraged the russians to help the trump campaign — though the evidence is not conclusive. The new york times, citing sources including lawyers and witnesses, reports that federal agents, apparently fearing manafort would destroy evidence, picked a lock and entered without warning when they raided his virginia home in july. The sources say that after the raid, special counsel robert mueller's prosecutor warned manafort that they planned to indict him. ( mueller has made a move that could be very bad news for manafort. )",

The appeal filed in a madison court on monday, which can be seen in full here, accuses authorities of searching his property illegally and claims that a juror with a preconceived notion that he was guilty improperly influenced other jurors during his 2007 trial for the murder of teresa halbach, the ap reports. Avery recently secured new legal representation from chicago-area lawyer kathleen zellner and the midwest innocence project, reports wbay, but monday's court filing appears to have been prepared without the new legal team. Zellner specializes in reversing convictions, and she says she has found new evidence that will exonerate avery, reports nbc news. The netflix documentary suggests that avery — who served 18 years for a rape he didn't commit before being released two years before the halbach murder — is the victim of a conspiracy, and a petition urging president obama and gov. Scott walker to free him now has more than 415,000 signatures. Walker, however, has never pardoned anybody, and wbay reports that he has signaled he isn't going to start with avery.

        "summary": "As has been widely noted, mitch mcconnell had a truly awful tuesday. The senate majority leader had to surrender on obamacare repeal, ally bob corker announced he was retiring, and, perhaps worst of all, the senate candidate that mcconnell strongly backed in alabama got trounced by one backed by the steve bannon contingent. Just how bad is it for mcconnell? here's a look at coverage: mocked by trump: the president has taken to doing physical impressions of a slump-shouldered mcconnell, reports axios. Trump also reportedly called out mcconnell as \" weak \" at a dinner with conservative activists, reports politico. On the wane: mcconnell has gone from \" brilliant tactician \" to looking vulnerable after the defeats this week, reports the new york times. If the gop fails to get tax reform passed this year, his post as majority leader could be in jeopardy — especially with populist insurgents backed by bannon looking to win more seats. No immediate danger: both politico and the times say mcconnell retains rock-solid support in the republican conference and thus is not in any immediate peril. Much of that support is based on his formidable fundraising skills on behalf of senate republicans. Beware the midterms: in a piece subtitled, \" is the senate leader losing his grip on the gop?, \" abigail tracy at vanity fair notes that midterm elections in general are often unkind to the party in power: \" with the gop in the midst of an ideological schism, mcconnell's faction could be headed for a reckoning. \" indeed, tuesday's triple whammy \" just shows how weak the republican establishment is right now, \" writes harry enten at fivethirtyeight. Boehner's fate? mcconnell is willing to take all the criticism coming from conservatives over the obamacare fail, especially if it protects rank-and-file republicans, per an analysis at the washington post. \" but one thing that could hamper mcconnell's long-term standing would be if he became a real albatross to his own incumbents in primary elections ahead, \" writes paul kane. Fear of that played a role in john boehner's resignation as house speaker two years ago. False narrative: many in the media are portraying the alabama results as a loss for trump, but winner roy moore is decidedly trumpian, writes erick erickson at the resurgent. No, this was all about mcconnell — in fact, moore made running against him \" the theme of his campaign. \"",

To conduct their research, the team observed 16 younger adults between the ages of 19-30 and 16 older adults between the ages of 60-82 as they took part in a sequence of memory tests between 1: 00 and 5: 00 pm. For these tests, the participants needed to study and recall a set of picture and word combinations that appeared on a computer",
            "A new study provides strong evidence of noticeable differences in brain function through the day for older adults. Canadian researchers discovered older adults perform better on demanding cognitive tasks in the morning. Moreover, brain imaging shows that during this time of the day, elders also activate the same brain networks responsible for paying attention and suppressing distraction as younger adults the study, as published in the journal psychology and aging, has yielded some of the strongest evidence yet that there are noticeable differences in brain function across the day for older adults. \"time of day really does matter when testing older adults. This age group is more focused and better able to ignore distraction in the morning than in the afternoon, \" said lead author john anderson, a doctoral candidate in psychology at the university of toronto's rotman research institute at baycrest health sciences. \"their improved cognitive performance in the morning correlated with greater activation of the brain's attentional control regions — the rostral prefrontal and superior parietal cortex — similar to that of younger adults. \" asked how his team's findings may be useful to older adults in their daily activities, anderson recommended that older adults try to schedule their most mentally challenging tasks for the morning time. Those tasks could include doing taxes, taking a test ( such as a driver's license renewal ), seeing"

Councilors will today consider a motion that would call on rob ford to apologize, take a leave of absence, and cooperate with a police investigation into his activities, cbc reports. Just one problem: even if it passes ( ford, who made the motion the key item at today's council meeting, has promised a \" rumble in the jungle \" debate ), ford won't actually have to heed the request. If he refuses, the city council can ask ontario to pass legislation removing him, but the council itself can't remove him from office since he hasn't been convicted of a crime — and councilors are hesitant to ask ontario to step in. With \" no clear legal path to force him out, \" the ap reports, the council is looking for a way to isolate ford and run the city without him, which could actually be possible, since the powers of the toronto mayor are more limited than the powers of many mayors in big us cities. \" we really just have to build a box around the mayor so we can get work done, \" says one councilor. A second option to be debated next month: a motion that would further limit ford's powers, basically keeping him from being able to fire executive committee members who want him out. \" we will shun him, curtail his power as best we can, \" says another councilor. \" he clearly has gone off the deep end, shot himself in outer space. \" much of the public, though, still loves ford: hundreds lined up to buy \" robbie bobbie \" bobblehead dolls yesterday; they're being sold for charity.",

The film and cultural studies professor from kingston university in england says he ' ll dress like bowie, eat like bowie, watch the same movies and read the same books as bowie, and act like bowie's various personas over the course of a year, all in the name of research for a book he's writing on the pop icon, reports the guardian. \" the idea is to inhabit bowie's headspace at points in his life and career to understand his work from an original angle, while retaining a critical and objective perspective at the same time, \" brooker says. He last month told australia's abc news in a video interview he started the project as \" 1965 bowie \"; he has lately emulated bowie's 1974 philadelphia soul period. He ' ll suffer from a lack of sleep but avoid cocaine. \" the levels of cocaine bowie was consuming is not just illegal for a professor like myself, but it's much too expensive — as well as unhealthy, \" brooker says. \" i had a six-pack of energy drinks to try and simulate the experience, \" he adds. \" it made me very jumpy. \" he ' ll also likely avoid \" a fling with mick jagger, \" he says, per rolling stone. But he consumed only red peppers and milk for a time and has visited cities linked to the singer. The project is likely to be anything but boring, but a year as the icon will be more than enough. Bowie's head can be a \" strange \" and \" dangerous \" place, \" a place you wouldn't want to live too long, \" brooker says. Next up: 1983. \" i think i ' ll get a tan, get fit, get my hair changed again, get my teeth whitened, \" he says. There's a bright yellow suit waiting in his closet.

That payback apparently includes not letting the diplomats get their stuff out first, per reuters, which reports that a news agency cameraman spotted five vehicles sporting diplomatic license plates drive up to the retreat monday, only to be turned away. \" the us mission to russia was supposed to have access to our dacha until noon on august 1, \" an embassy spokeswoman says, citing an agreement with the russian government. \" we have not had access all day today or yesterday. We refer you to the russian government to explain why not. \" the russian government doesn't deny the deadline, but it's taking issue with the us'side of things. Per the ria state news agency, a russian foreign ministry rep says the property — which the moscow times describes as a \" 2,000-square-meter warehouse in an industrial area \" — is in a conservation area, and so the trucks used by the americans can't enter without proper permits ( the official says three of those vehicles were industrial-sized cargo trucks, per rt.com ). The official also scoffs at the suggestion russia was flat-out barring the us from the dacha, noting that assertion was a \" premeditated provocation. \" meanwhile, us ambassador to russia john tefft gathered all moscow embassy staff to inform them of russia's decision, which includes slashing 755 roles at us diplomatic missions. \" the atmosphere was like a funeral, \" one unnamed source said, per the independent.",

The delay, which reduces america's bargaining power at next month's copenhagen conference, reflects weakening support for the controversial \" cap-and-trade \" bill as unemployment remains high, the wall street journal notes. The bill strategy calls for capping overall greenhouse-gas emissions, but would allow companies to buy and trade permits allowing certain amounts of emissions. President obama is working with senate leaders to get the bill through as quickly as possible, said a white house spokesman. The delay, however, has raised fears that the senate may end up putting off debating the bill for as long as 2011 to avoid holding a vote just before next year's midterm elections. \" there would be nothing better than for us to talk about over the summer than democrats pushing a huge new energy tax, \" one republican leadership aide told the hill.",

A measure with the nickname the \" french patriot act \" cleared the lower house of parliament in france today, reports france24. The legislation now goes to the senate, where it seems likely to pass, reports the new york times, which provides some specifics: the provisions would let intelligence services \" tap cellphones, read emails and force internet providers to comply with government requests to sift through virtually all of their subscribers ' communications. \" advocates insist the monitoring would be directed at suspected terrorists, but critics don't buy it. A nine-person committee set up to oversee the surveillance would have only an advisory role and could not overrule the prime minister. The measure \" shows a number of tactics that seem cribbed from the nsa, including bulk collection of internet metadata, which would allow the government to track french citizens from site to site, \" notes a post at the verge. The legislation also allows intelligence services to put microphones in a room or on objects to record conversations, and to use other devices to intercept phone conversations and text messages. The french debate follows the attacks on the charlie hebdo offices, and \" many in the socialist party who would normally have spoken out against the new powers have instead kept quiet, \" observes the bbc. \" in the wake of the january attacks, there is little political mileage in raising doubts about the intelligence services. \" ( in the us, things seem to be moving in the opposite direction. )",

        "summary": "Apple appears to have decided that it doesn't make a lot of sense for the company to be tougher on marijuana apps than 23 state governments are on marijuana. Isaac dietrich, co-founder of pot-themed social network massroots, tells the san francisco chronicle that apple has decided to allow his app back in its app store, as long as it's restricted to the states where marijuana is legal, at least for medicinal purposes. The app had been in the store since july 2013, but it was yanked in november along with dozens of other marijuana-related ones, the chronicle reports. Dietrich started an online petition last month to have the massroots app reinstated. \" we're a social network for cannabis that enables people to talk about the plant in ways most people don't feel comfortable on other social networks, \" he told adweek. \" i don't want grandma to see me taking bong rips on facebook. \" in a blog post, massroots thanked the cannabis community for its support. The company says it now has \" a duty to show the world that cannabis consumption can be done in a safe and responsible manner in compliance with state laws and federal enforcement guidelines \" and will strengthen its own compliance even beyond what's required. ( maybe apple will now stop refusing to spell-check \" marijuana. \" )",

Gilead sciences, the sixth richest drugmaker in the world, \" is making a fortune selling essential drugs to the very government and taxpayers that helped pay to develop them, and then dodging taxes on the resulting profits, \" says frank clemente, executive director of americans for tax fairness, which issued the report this month. Gilead has avoided some $ 10 billion in taxes by moving assets to ireland, where there is a lower tax rate, and then not bringing some $ 28.5 billion in profits back into the us. Per the washington post, the california-based company's revenues in 2015 hit $ 32.6 billion, up three times from 2012. As for the accusation of gouging: last year, a senate investigation found that the company \" pursued [ a ] profit-driven strategy \" with its hepatitis drugs, rather than making the drugs more accessible at a lower price ( it had considered $ 50,000 ). As the post notes, gilead, which declined to comment on the report, isn't alone in looking overseas for tax relief. Plenty of other pharmaceutical and technology companies do it. Apple, for instance, has squirreled away nearly $ 200 billion abroad, bloomberg reported last year. According to citizens for tax justice, that's enabled the company to avoid paying $ 59.2 billion in us taxes. Pfizer has some $ 193 billion abroad, per the post. The new report singling out gilead, the post points out, highlights the \" simmering battle \" between president obama and big business over the practice of sending assets to foreign countries.",

        "summary": "One of the two brothers who detonated a suicide bomb in brussels on monday was clearly worried about getting caught just prior to the attacks. Authorities revealed a note written by ibrahim el bakraoui, 29, that reads: \" being in a hurry, i don't know what to do, being searched for everywhere, not being safe. If it drags on it could end up with me in a prison cell next to him. \" the \" him \" is believed to refer to salah abdeslam, the suspected terrorist ringleader arrested last week, reports usa today. The note was found on a computer that had been dumped into a street trash can outside an apartment building in brussels, reports abc news. A taxi driver led police to the building after realizing that he had driven el bakraoui and two others to the airport on monday morning. Also on tuesday, authorities clarified some confusing earlier accounts of the investigation: they now say that ibrahim el bakraoui is the man seen in the middle of two others in a surveillance photo from the airport. On the left is a fellow suicide bomber, still unidentified, and on the right is another suspect, clad in white, who remains at large. Some media reports have identified him as najim laachraoui, who is suspected of paying a role in the paris attacks, but authorities have not officially identified laachraoui as a suspect in brussels. Ibrahim el bakraoui's brother, khalid, 27, meanwhile, is accused of detonating a suicide bomb on the brussels subway train. In another development, a turkish official says ibrahim el bakraoui was arrested in june at the turkey-syria border and deported to the netherlands. Turkey then warned both the netherlands and belgium that he was a \" foreign terrorist fighter, \" reports ap.",

But if you know anything about alien movies, you ' ll know there's only terror in store. Here's what critics are saying about the latest installment of the franchise, with director ridley scott of 1979's alien returning: the filmmakers have finally managed to \" dig the series out of its hole, \" todd mccarthy puts it at the hollywood reporter. He calls alien: covenant \" the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two. \" beautiful and gripping, it \" feels vital \" and is \" keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow. \" peter howell at the toronto star agrees this flick \" ranks among the better chapters \" of the franchise. Scott \" breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts \" and \" brings back the visceral panic that fans expect. \" actors katherine waterston, danny mcbride, billy crudup, and michael fassbender — who delivers \" a grand performance times two \" as two separate robots — also deserve high praise, he writes. The inclusion of fassbender's david, from 2012's prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. But there was little else that impressed him. There's just \" nothing new \" to this \" gore fest, \" he writes. He acknowledges, however, that \" many alien fans will come looking for something old, and that's in bloodily abundant supply. \" chris klimek had his own issues with the film. For example, \" a religious subtext is introduced and then immediately abandoned, \" he writes at npr. But he, too, had to marvel at fassbender, whose \" existential rap session \" provides the \" freshest part of the movie. \" then again, fassbender's david \" is the only character in whom scott seems truly interested, \" he writes.",

The washington post reports jay solomon, chief foreign affairs correspondent for the journal, had received pulitzer consideration and was well-liked by the paper's editor in chief. His shocking termination springs from an ap investigation into farhad azima, who solomon used as a source for stories. Azima, who has dealt weapons to multiple nations and was tied to the iran-contra affair, offered solomon a 10 % stake in a company called denx. While it's unclear if solomon ever accepted that stake, the ap uncovered 18 months of emails and texts between solomon and azima discussing business together. In 2014, solomon texted azima: \" our business opportunities are so promising. \" the following year, azima wished solomon luck \" on his first defense sale \" in regards to delivering a proposal to uae representatives. Also in 2015, there was talk of denx being involved in an effort to bring down the government of kuwait, though solomon denies any knowledge of that. \" mr. Solomon violated his ethical obligations as a reporter, as well as our standards, \" politico quotes a statement from the journal as saying. The newspaper says it was \" dismayed \" by solomon's actions and \" poor judgement. \" solomon, while denying ever getting into business with azima, says he understands \" why the emails and the conversations i had with mr.

For three months, taylor and his deputy, john sheardown, hid at their tehran homes the six us hostages who escaped from the american embassy after it was overrun by iranian student radicals on nov. 4, 1979. Along with the cia, taylor helped arrange the hostages ' escape by procuring plane tickets and fake canadian passports. It was an incredibly risky operation that included passport foul-ups and a suspicious airport official, but the six hostages flew to safety from tehran's airport on jan. 28, 1980, the new york times reported. Taylor's iran exploits were chronicled both in the 2013 documentary our man in tehran and in ben affleck's oscar-winning argo, though critics complained of the latter movie's inaccuracies, saying it minimized the canadians ' role in the rescue and gave most of the credit to the cia. \" canada was not merely standing around watching events take place, \" taylor told the toronto star in 2012. \" the cia was a junior partner. \" ( affleck later apologized and reworked the closing credits that mentioned taylor's role, the atlantic notes. ) meanwhile, taylor's wife of 50 years, pat, remembers one of her husband's most notable traits: his generous spirit. \" he did all sorts of things for everyone without any expectation of something coming back, \" she tells the ap. \" it's why that incident in iran happened.

        "summary": "Isis has reportedly lost one of its more unlikely members: sally jones, a former punk singer from britain who traveled to syria to become a recruiter for the group in 2013. A british intelligence source tells the sun that jones was killed in june by a drone strike near syria's border with iraq. \" the americans zapped her trying to get away from raqqa. Quite frankly, it's good riddance, \" the source says. Jones, 50, left the uk with her son to marry 21-year-old isis hacker junaid hussain, reports usa today, which describes her as britain's most-wanted female terrorist. She became known as the \" white widow \" after hussain died in a drone strike in 2015. Jones'death has not been confirmed, though the social media accounts she used to offer western women advice on joining isis and traveling to syria have been silent for months, the guardian reports. \" you christians all need beheading with a nice blunt knife and stuck on the railings at raqqa... Come here i ' ll do it for you, \" she said in one post. Jojo, jones ' 12-year-old son, may also have been killed in the airstrike. He was radicalized in syria and his grandparents identified him last year as an executioner seen in an isis video. Authorities say they're not sure if he was with jones — and the brainwashed boy was too young to be declared a target in any case.",

        "summary": "\" dystopian \" and \" horrifying \" are just two adjectives tim maughan uses to describe for the bbc what he recently witnessed in the remote industrial city of baotou in inner mongolia. Most disturbing was his visit to a man-made lake filled with toxic sludge that makes the surrounding area smell like sulfur, wielding an environmental impact that has turned the place into what maughan says is \" like hell on earth. \" the wasteland is the site of one of the world's largest rare-earth-mineral productions, where processing plants churn out cerium oxide, neodymium, and other rare earth elements necessary for everything from consumer electronics ( cellphones, tablet touchscreens ) to the magnets in \" green \" products such as wind turbines and electric car motors, per the bbc. The unfortunate byproduct of this venture: the dangerous chemical waste in the lake right outside of the city, maughan notes. China claims the lion's share of the world's production of these minerals: livescience has reported it produced about 95 % of our rare earth elements in 2009. A local pol told the guardian in 2012 that before the factories were erected in the late ' 50s, \" there were watermelons, aubergines, and tomatoes. \" but maughan — who traveled there with a design research group to \" [ trace ] back the route consumer goods take from china to our shops and homes \" — now found just abandoned outposts, \" huge diesel-belching coal trucks, \" and the sludge-filled lake. \" nothing prepared me for the sight, \" he writes. \" it's a truly alien environment. … the thought that it is man-made depressed and terrified me, as did the realization that this was the byproduct not just of the consumer electronics in my pocket, but also green technologies like wind turbines and electric cars that we get so smugly excited about in the west. \" ( if you need happier environmental news, here's one good story. )",

Invented in australia, the test weighs 29 different criteria — including blood pressure, respiratory rate, and medical history — to determine whether hospitalization is worthwhile or the patient should return home or go to a hospice, the sydney morning herald reports. The idea is to prevent needless and expensive procedures while allowing patients to spend their last days with loved ones. \" most terminally ill people want to die at home, but in fact three quarters end up dying in acute hospitals, often after intrusive, expensive, and ultimately pointless medical procedures, \" says study author magnolia cardona-morrell, the independent reports. The test also aims to take pressure off doctors and nurses to prolong patients ' lives \" at all costs, \" the telegraph reports. \" i had lots of nurses and doctors standing there saying, ' we have been waiting for a tool like this for years, when can we start using it? ' \" says cardona-morrell, whose work was presented recently at a us medical conference. \" to me that is an indication there is a need out there. \" she says the test takes just five or 10 minutes, and helps doctors have a more \" transparent \" conversation with patients. Called cristal, it's now being tested to see if it would have predicted the future of patients who have since died. Then it may be used in more hospitals.

A distinctive tattoo on hammond's right forearm can also be seen in gamestop security video. Hammond, last spotted driving a white 2006 ford taurus, has two other active felony warrants charging him with burglary and criminal damage to property. Hammond -- who has been dubbed \"big dasani \" by one georgia wag -- is seen in the below mug shot snapped after a prior arrest. In seeking the public's assistance st.

The agency managing the election is predicting turnout somewhere between 60 % and 65 % — above 2010's 49.7 %, but below 2008's 69.2 % \" if there's any state that epitomizes what the permanent campaign feels like, it's this one, \" observes david catanese of politico. This will be the seventh time wisconsin has gone to the polls in the last 14 months, thanks to various recalls. All those campaigns are expensive: through may 21, $ 110 million had been spent on political ads. President obama will be closely watching the results, because he's counting on wisconsin in november, the new york times points out. \" a republican victory here could set off a wave of adjustments in the lineup of swing states. \" if scott walker wins, cillizza expects to hear presidential rumblings surrounding him. A lot is on the line for barrett, too; this would be his third gubernatorial defeat, likely ending his statewide ambitions. Organized labor has a lot to lose, too. A walker win would be both an affirmation of his anti-union policies, and a signal that unions have lost their political juice; they opposed barrett in the primary, and lost there, too.",

Of course, she also keeps insisting she won't run. Joe biden: the world took notice when he said yesterday that he'd probably vote for himself again someday — but he later joked that he just meant he'd be running for county councilman in the future. Andrew cuomo: the new york governor has access to lots of money, and his liberal stance on social issues combined with a more fiscally conservative stance could make him a formidable contender. But don't expect him to run if hillary does; he served under bill clinton and is loyal to the family. Other possible democrats: maryland gov. Martin o ' malley, los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa, and sen. Kirsten gillibrand. Paul ryan: he fared well as romney's running mate and got himself re-elected to boot, so clearly he's a top contender. Marco rubio: the charismatic florida senator could help the gop increase its appeal to latino voters. Chris christie: his tough talk has made him quite popular, and he's seen as more of a bipartisan figure now that he's praised the federal response to hurricane sandy. Other possible republicans: jeb bush, mike huckabee, plus pretty much anyone who ran in the primary this time around. But in the international herald tribune, harvey morris has just one piece of advice: \" take a breath, america! give yourselves time to recover from what seemed the longest and certainly was the most expensive campaign in us political history before starting on the next one. \"",

Crews seemed especially grateful to several actors who voiced their support for the show along with its many fans. On saturday, he name-checked some fellow celebrities to thank them for amplifying the show's cause, including star wars actor mark hamill. \" i want to personally thank you mark for using the power of the force to save brooklyn nine nine! *wipes dirt off shoulder*, \" crews tweeted. Per the hollywood reporter, crews also gave shout-outs to actor sean astin and broadway star lin-manuel miranda. By sunday, however, it began to seem like crews ' gratitude may have been misdirected. While the fan outcry was heartening, nbc entertainment chairman robert greenblatt told the ap that because of business considerations, the pickup already was in the works. The show is made by a studio owned by nbc universal. Greenblatt said if he had known earlier in the series'development that andy samberg was going to star in brooklyn nine-nine, nbc's studio never would have sold it to fox in the first place. \" it was a missed opportunity for us from the beginning, \" he said. \" we jumped on it really quickly, and we're thrilled to have it. \"",

The sources say the firearm wasn't the agent's official gun, and abc news reports that the bureau of land management is investigating whether the gun belonged to one of its employees. Sanchez, who claims the gun went off accidentally when he picked it up, killing 32-year-old kathryn steinle, pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder yesterday, the ap reports. Sanchez has been deported from the us five times, and san francisco's decision not to turn him over to federal authorities for deportation when a drug charge was dropped in april has been strongly criticized by lawmakers and presidential candidates, including hillary clinton, who told cnn yesterday that the \" city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported. \" at yesterday's hearing, sanchez's public defender said the shooting appeared accidental and argued that the media should look at the \" ubiquitous nature of guns in our society \" instead of the immigration issue, the chronicle reports.",

And it turns out that one of them really didn't want his daughter to marry her boyfriend. The patients all had advanced als and were unable to control even their eyes, reports the guardian. In other words, they had \" locked-in syndrome, \" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the university of tübingen in germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal plos biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. \"it's the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life, \" says researcher niels birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \" happy \" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. ( birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation. ) and one patient, who is 61, answered \" no \" nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend mario. \" but they got married, \" one of the researchers tells the bbc. \" nothing can come between love. \" ( researchers can't explain how stephen hawking has lived this long. )",

On sept. 13 — a day after remarking that she'd come across dozens of men in motor boats armed with arrows and rifles near coari, an area known to be frequented by river pirates and drug traffickers — kelty sent out a distress signal and then went silent, reports the guardian. Authorities now believe the 43-year-old british woman had pitched her tent on the banks of an amazon tributary near lauro sodré when she was approached by men who shot her and threw her body in the river. A man and two 17-year-olds are in custody while police search for four other suspects who may have tried to sell kelty's tech devices. A search for kelty's body is also underway. A statement from kelty's siblings note they're \" extremely proud \" of their sister, who sought \" to prove that challenges were achievable. \" ( she had quit her job as a school principal in 2014 to travel solo. ) back in february, kelty — who became the sixth woman to ski solo to the south pole in january — told the bbc that surviving encounters with \" people who organ-harvest and rob and fire guns \" was \" half the challenge \" of her amazon adventure. \" but it's about minimizing the risk, \" she said. \" i ' m going to a self-defense course which is going to be tailored to de-arming people, so if i do come across that situation at least i ' m prepared for it. \"",

            "Posting on social media on 10 september, emma kelty joked about a warning she had been given about the stretch of the amazon river she was about to enter. \"so in or near coari ( 60 miles ) i will have my boat stolen and i will be killed too, \" she wrote. \"nice. \" two days later, kelty, who was canoeing the length of the amazon, said she was \"in the clear \". But hours later she posted again, describing an encounter with armed men. \"turned corner and found 50 guys in motor boats with arrows!!! my face must have been a picture!! ( town was uber quiet... Too quiet!! ) all go... \"ok 30 guys... But either way... That's a lot of folks in one area in boats with arrow[ s ] and rifles. \" three people held in brazil on suspicion of british kayaker's murder read more the following day, as she neared coari, on the banks of the solimões river, an amazon tributary, kelty triggered a distress signal. She has been missing ever since. On tuesday, police said they had arrested three males on suspicion of her murder. Kelty, 43, from finchley in north-west london, resigned as head of knollmead primary school in surbiton in 2014 to go travelling. No stranger to solo adventures, she had been only the sixth woman to ski solo to the south pole and hiked 2,600 miles alone across the us. She had begun kayaking in february after deciding that her next challenge would be to paddle the amazon from its source in the peruvian andes to the atlantic ocean. There had already been unsettling moments in her trip, particularly since crossing the border into brazil's amazonas state. On 22 august she told followers how she had paddled hard upstream to reach a beach to rest, \"only to find a man waving a machete and ravens eating whatever he had killed. As i paddled hard away... I could hear his shouts. \" in the following days she complained of broken sleep, interrupted by strangers. \"getting more tired every day, \" she wrote on 23 august. \"let"

California is almost certainly ok with that. \"i have decided that sections of the wall that california wants built now will not be built until the whole wall is approved, \" reuters quotes trump as tweeting on wednesday. But it's unclear exactly why trump thinks california wants a border wall, as the state sued the federal government to stop construction of said wall. In fact, in the very same tweet trump referred to the lawsuit after a federal judge ruled against the state of california and environmental groups. \"big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed, \" he tweeted. \" our country must have border security! \" california and environmental groups argued john kelly, then secretary of homeland security, overstepped his powers when he waived environmental reviews for the border wall, which experts say could harm threatened and endangered species, nbc news reports. Us district court judge gonzalo curiel ruled they weren't able to prove that. If the name sounds familiar, it's because curiel is the same \" mexican \" judge trump claimed couldn't be objective because of his heritage, according to politico. Trump also called curiel, who was born in indiana, a \" hater \" and \" very hostile. \" curiel ruled a decision on the wall should be left up to politicians, not the courts. \" it is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices, \" he wrote in his decision.",

Now all eyes are on state's attorney marilyn mosby, who is in her fourth month on the job and at 35 is the youngest lead prosecutor in any major us city, reports nbc news. Her supporters, though, say she's perfect for the case. Police work runs in her family, but she campaigned for office talking tough against police brutality. \" she has a natural affinity for police officers and law enforcement types, and at the same time, she is aware of the incredible number of complaints against the baltimore city police department, \" says an attorney who knows her. \" it was important to have somebody who was willing to look at it from both sides, and marilyn mosby fits the bill. \" mosby's office released a statement emphasizing that it will conduct its own investigation into gray's death and not just rely on the police report. One new wrinkle: police revealed that the van carrying gray made an additional, previously undisclosed, stop on the way to the police station, though the reason and significance aren't clear. The ap says the van stopped at \" a desolate intersection with three vacant lots and a corner store. \" ( earlier, another prisoner in the van suggested that gray was trying to injure himself, at least according to a police document cited by the washington post. )",

        "summary": "The fbi is warning state officials to boost their election security in light of evidence that hackers breached related data systems in two states, the ap reports. In a confidential \" flash \" alert from its cyber division, first reported by yahoo news and posted online by others, the fbi said it's investigating the pair of incidents and advised states to scan their systems for specific signs of hacking. The fbi said monday that it doesn't comment on specific alerts, but added that it routinely sends out advisories to private industry about signs of cyber threats that it comes across in its investigations. The fbi didn't name the states that were breached. State election websites in arizona and illinois experienced hack-related shutdowns earlier this summer. In both cases, the parts of the websites attacked involved online voter registration. \"this is a big deal, \" a cybersecurity expert tells yahoo news. \" two state election boards have been popped, and data has been taken. This certainly should be concerning to the common american voter. \" the fbi's aug. 18 warning came just days after homeland security secretary jeh johnson hosted a call with secretaries of state and other state election officials to talk about cybersecurity and election infrastructure. In that call, johnson said that while dhs isn't aware of any particular cyber threat against election-related computers, it's \" critically important \" to make sure that election systems are secure amid a rapidly changing threat landscape, according to a dhs summary of the call. Federal officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the possibility that hackers, particularly those working for russia or another country, could breach us elections systems and wreak havoc on the november presidential election.",

The massive leak of internal documents from bermuda-based law firm appleby is spurring headlines like this one: \" lewis hamilton avoided taxes on £ 17m jet using isle of man scheme. \" it has also led bernie sanders to warn of a \" rapid movement toward international oligarchy. \" in a statement to the guardian, he says the papers show \" how these billionaires and multinational corporations get richer by hiding their wealth and profits and avoid paying their fair share of taxes. \" two apparent examples, as revealed by some of the 13.4 million records being examined: apple: the tech giant has employed a maneuver called the \" double irish \" that allows the company to route its non-americas revenue in a way that incurs very little tax. The eu in 2013 decided to probe this arrangement, and ireland cracked down: it announced that firms incorporated there wouldn't be allowed to be stateless for tax purposes, as apple's irish subsidiaries were. The paradise papers leak reveals apple found its state. Communications between applelby and apple show apple asking about the benefits that might come from various options ( think bermuda, the cayman islands, the isle of man ). It ended up going with jersey, an island between england and france, reports the bbc, where foreign companies are taxed at a 0 % rate. Nike: the guardian reports the paradise papers spell out exactly how nike has been able to reduce its tax burden, and says the netherlands is key. From 2005 to 2014, the revenue from sales throughout europe went there, and much of it then traveled to bermuda via its bermudan subsidiary, nike international ltd. That subsidiary was pretty much a shell: no office, no staff, but it possessed nike's intellectual property rights, which let it impose big royalty fees of nike's european headquarters, which created the funnel that legally allowed profits to move to the bermuda subsidiary. Then things got even weirder with the creation of the subsidiary nike innovate cv which is based... Nowhere. The guardian explains.",

Investigators begin analysis at the scene where an amtrak passenger train derailed on a bridge over interstate highway i-5 in dupont, washington, on dec. 18, 2017. Steve dipaola / reuters file the results of the preliminary review, released on friday, come from details gathered from an \" event data recorder \" and cameras mounted on the lead locomotive. The devices captured the crew's actions, their conversations and other information, the ntsb said. The recordings included comments by the engineer about six seconds before the derailment about \" an over speed condition, \" the ntsb said in a statement. Officials said earlier this week that the engineer was in a cab with a conductor and that the train's brakes were engaged automatically, not by the engineer.

The train was making the inaugural run of a new route aimed at cutting travel times and improving safety south of tacoma. Investigators begin analysis at the scene where an amtrak passenger train derailed on a bridge over interstate highway i-5 in dupont, washington, on dec. 18, 2017. Steve dipaola / reuters file the results of the preliminary review, released on friday, come from details gathered from an \" event data recorder \" and cameras mounted on the lead locomotive. The devices captured the crew's actions, their conversations and other information, the ntsb said. The recordings included comments by the engineer about six seconds before the derailment about \" an over speed condition, \" the ntsb said in a statement. Officials said earlier this week that the engineer was in a cab with a conductor and that the train's brakes were engaged automatically, not by the engineer. The recording ended with the locomotive tilting and the crew bracing for impact, the statement said. Related: amtrak derailment: train was traveling at 80 mph in 30-mph zone the final recorded speed of the locomotive was 78 mph, which is within the limits for the approach to the crash location, but not the location itself, which followed a curve with a posted 30 mph speed limit, according to the ntsb. There's a sign noting the speed limit about two miles before the curve, the ntsb said. The train was not equipped with positive train control, which can prevent derailments caused by excessive speed, officials have said.

        "summary": "Scott walker is out of the gop race after a campaign that peaked well before it officially began: he led the polls in iowa for much of the year, but he has dropped out of the race after just 71 days, which abc news reports is one of the shortest modern presidential campaigns on record. Where did it all go wrong for the wisconsin governor? insiders tell politico that walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \" making it up as he went along, \" causing plenty of strategic blunders. Fundraising dried up as donald trump's rise pushed him to the sidelines, leaving him with a large organization but little support. His sudden departure from the race came after he failed to make an impression at the second debate and a cnn poll found his support at well below 1 %. \" he was a terrible candidate, but he also got trump-ed, \" a source tells politico. More: sources tell cnn that although a super pac supporting him had plenty of cash, walker's campaign funds started to dry up after the first debate as donors looked elsewhere. Walker \" is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback \" after his poll numbers collapsed even in iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, cnn notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the canadian border. In his exit speech last night, walker said he had been \" called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field. \" he urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to trump could emerge, the washington post reports. Some of walker's former rivals praised him as he left the race, including marco rubio, who called him \" one of the best governors in the country, \" and donald trump, who said \" he's a very nice person and has a great future, \" reports the hill. The rival campaigns didn't wait until walker announced his exit to start trying to poach his aides and his donors, the ap reports. The competition heated up after the announcement: a source close to the billionaire ricketts family, which had supported walker, tells the ap that within minutes of the governor's press conference, the family received calls from six campaigns, some of them from the candidates themselves.

Egeland told police he'd been attacked after stopping to assist a pregnant driver, but investigators got suspicious when his pricey bmw, his wallet, and his cellphone weren't taken, the idaho statesman reports. Then they learned about his recent insurance, and the whole thing unravelled. Now egeland is facing an extra 3 years and 10 months for his roadside scheme and had his leg amputated from the shotgun blast.

And ticket sales dropped 11 % between 2004 and 2013, the motion picture association of america reported yesterday. To combat the trend, theaters are mulling a coordinated move: they may drop ticket prices on one weeknight a week, the wall street journal reports. The national association of theatre owners plans to try it out in one state this year. Which night will be cheap night isn't yet clear. The move would run counter to theaters ' current habit of raising prices each year — a trend which has resulted in higher revenues despite lower ticket sales. Last year, for instance, the average ticket price was $ 8.13, up from $ 7.96 in 2012. Box-office sales, meanwhile, hit $ 10.9 billion, compared to $ 10.8 billion in 2012. The cheap-day system \" has worked for years in latin america and canada, \" says theater owners association head john fithian, per deadline.

In the 2-year-old image, he's reportedly wearing an ss hat, making the nazi salute, and holding two fingers under his nose in what appears to be an imitation of hitler's mustache; there's a model airplane in the background that looks like the kind flown by the third reich. James ' ex-wife, janine lindemulder, decided to ramp up her custody battle again since the cheating allegations came out. James and bullock initially won full custody of 6-year-old daughter sunny, but lindemulder thinks bullock will file for divorce — leading a judge to perhaps grant lindemulder partial custody. Mcgee has gone back to her roots — stripping. Tmz has a video of her dancing at a san diego nightclub last week. Don't expect mcgee to stop talking about james anytime soon.

The white bystander, who had a key to the building, let the group inside; the first white man then insisted they not get on the elevator with him and asked repeatedly whether they had a key to the building. As the group attempted to enter the elevator, the man pulled out a gun. \" he made sure we saw that he had a gun so we didn't get in the elevator, \" says butterfield, who notes that the group had earlier questioned whether the man actually lived in the building, since it is student housing and he looked older than most residents. ( at one point in the video, the man can be heard saying, \" where am i going? i am going upstairs to get laid. \" ) the students, who were ultimately let into the building by their friend, reported the incident to police the following day. Building management has since released a statement saying the man in the video is not a resident. Social media users identified him, and his employer announced he has been fired from his position as general manager of a nearby hotel.",

One of the students, isaiah butterfield, captured part of the 10-minute confrontation on video and posted it on twitter, where it has since been retweeted nearly 6,000 times. The clip shows a white man wearing a baseball cap claiming to be a resident of the building and then getting into a verbal altercation with the group of black students, before pulling a gun out in an apparent effort to stop them from getting in an elevator. Social media users and local outlets identified the man as don crandall, a manager at the baymont inn &amp; suites by wyndham hotels. On tuesday, the pax hotel group, which owns the inn, posted a statement on instagram confirming that its general manager was involved, condemned his actions, and said that he had been fired. \" our team has gone ahead and took the actions necessary, \" the group said, adding that it does not \" stand behind the actions of our former general manager... We would like to apologize to those affected by the actions of our former employee. \" in a message to residents monday night, the apartment complex's management said crandall is not a resident of the building, stadium centre, which is marketed as off-campus housing to college students in tallahassee. \"firearms are prohibited on our property and we take this matter very seriously, \" the management said in the message, which butterfield sent to buzzfeed news. \"moreover, we are firmly committed to creating a diverse residential community that is inclusive and welcoming to all. \" in an interview, butterfield described the encounter, which he said occurred while he and three friends — stephen brooks, joshua cosby, and fitzroy rhoden — were waiting at the garage entrance to the apartment building. Another friend, zavian flowers, had just moved into the building and was throwing a party, butterfield said.

        "summary": "Ever wondered how tiny a bumble bee's brain is? imagine a sesame seed clinging to a burger bun, reports the washington post — in other words, it's about 0.0002 % the volume of a human brain, as calculated by science. But that doesn't mean you can't teach a bee a new trick, as behavioral ecologist clint perry tells the paper: \" bees have some amazing cognitive abilities, \" including counting up to at least four. And now he and colleagues from queen mary university of london are reporting in the journal plos biology that bees can not only learn an entirely new skill to get food but also pass on their knowledge, which is one of the basic aspects of culture. In their study, researchers placed blue discs with sugar water beneath a clear plastic table, just out of reach, but affixed a string to each one that, if tugged, would move it within reach. Out of 110 bumble bees individually introduced to the task, some tugged at the strings before eventually quitting, and only two sorted out how to pull on the string to get the sugar water. However, when bees got to watch the ones retrieving the sugar water, more than 60 % of them were able to pull the string when it was their turn. One of the researchers tells science that, as exciting as the findings are, the explanation isn't necessarily that bees are smart, but that \" culturelike phenomena might actually be based on relatively simple mechanisms. \" ( one type of bumblebee has nearly gone extinct in 20 years. )",

            "For years, cognitive scientist lars chittka felt a bit eclipsed by his colleagues at queen mary university of london. Their studies of apes, crows, and parrots were constantly revealing how smart these animals were. He worked on bees, and at the time, almost everyone assumed that the insects acted on instinct, not intelligence. \" so there was a challenge for me: could we get our small-brained bees to solve tasks that would impress a bird cognition researcher? \" he recalls. Now, it seems he has succeeded at last. Chittka's team has shown that bumble bees can not only learn to pull a string to retrieve a reward, but they can also learn this trick from other bees, even though they have no experience with such a task in nature. The study \"successfully challenges the notion that ' big brains ' are necessary \" for new skills to",
            "Conversely, after 48 h of extensive training ( 20 instances of string pulling ), 11 of the 15 foragers solved the task without feedback from the moving blue flower ( s5 video ). Latency to obtaining the reward ( 147 ± 23.44 s ) was much higher than for normal blue flower training ( 22.1 ± 1.5 s; t test: t25 = 6.25, p < 0.0001 ). The subjects'success differs significantly from their performance when they were relatively inexperienced ( mcnemar test, χ 2 1 = 7.111, p = 0.008 ), thus indicating that the majority of highly experienced individuals may no longer require visual feedback to perform the necessary sequence of motor actions. In fact, experienced bees may not need the blue flower at all and perhaps have associated the string with the reward. The success of bees learning such a behavior raises the question about the mechanisms by which",
            "Scientists taught bumblebees to pull a string to get a food reward, and then those bees spread the learned technique to others. The groundbreaking study is the first to show that insects have the ability to learn and pass on knowledge and skills. ( reuters ) the bumblebee brain is puny, at least compared with the massive and fatty organ locked in your skull. At about 0.0002 percent the volume of yours, bee brains are close in size to the seeds stuck on a hamburger bun. Thinking about insect brains in terms of size alone, however, is a trap. The intelligence of sesame-brained bugs should not be underestimated. A study reported in the journal plos biology on tuesday, for instance, takes bee smarts in a surprising direction: scientists from the queen mary university of london suggest that the \"insects possess the essential cognitive elements for cultural transmission, \" as they wrote"

He worked on bees, and at the time, almost everyone assumed that the insects acted on instinct, not intelligence. \" so there was a challenge for me: could we get our small-brained bees to solve tasks that would impress a bird cognition researcher? \" he recalls. Now, it seems he has succeeded at last. Chittka's team has shown that bumble bees can not only learn to pull a string to retrieve a reward, but they can also learn this trick from other bees, even though they have no experience with such a task in nature. The study \"successfully challenges the notion that ' big brains ' are necessary \" for new skills to",
            "Conversely, after 48 h of extensive training ( 20 instances of string pulling ), 11 of the 15 foragers solved the task without feedback from the moving blue flower ( s5 video ). Latency to obtaining the reward ( 147 ± 23.44 s ) was much higher than for normal blue flower training ( 22.1 ± 1.5 s; t test: t25 = 6.25, p < 0.0001 ). The subjects'success differs significantly from their performance when they were relatively inexperienced ( mcnemar test, χ 2 1 = 7.111, p = 0.008 ), thus indicating that the majority of highly experienced individuals may no longer require visual feedback to perform the necessary sequence of motor actions. In fact, experienced bees may not need the blue flower at all and perhaps have associated the string with the reward. The success of bees learning such a behavior raises the question about the mechanisms by which",
            "Scientists taught bumblebees to pull a string to get a food reward, and then those bees spread the learned technique to others. The groundbreaking study is the first to show that insects have the ability to learn and pass on knowledge and skills. ( reuters ) the bumblebee brain is puny, at least compared with the massive and fatty organ locked in your skull. At about 0.0002 percent the volume of yours, bee brains are close in size to the seeds stuck on a hamburger bun. Thinking about insect brains in terms of size alone, however, is a trap. The intelligence of sesame-brained bugs should not be underestimated. A study reported in the journal plos biology on tuesday, for instance, takes bee smarts in a surprising direction: scientists from the queen mary university of london suggest that the \"insects possess the essential cognitive elements for cultural transmission, \" as they wrote"

California demonstrators, who also included faculty and parents, have been most visible, and mainly peaceful, though a car windshield was smashed during the gathering at the university of california-santa cruz, authorities tell the san francisco chronicle, and punches were thrown at the university of wisconsin-milwaukee, the ap adds. Students from uc-davis tried to march from that campus to the state capitol in sacramento, 15 miles away, using interstate 80, but were turned away by police using pepper spray. At the cal state-dominguez hills campus, protestors played a mock wheel of fortune game, where spins could yield \"graduating in 4 years with a good education \" and \"a 30 % fee increase, \" the los angeles times adds.",
