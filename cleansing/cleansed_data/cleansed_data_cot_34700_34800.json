She declined to comment beyond what was contained in the letter. \" i am not getting paid for speaking up. I am not getting rewarded from your political opponents. What i am getting is stronger by refusing to blame myself and speaking the truth out loud, \" the letter states. \" the initial barrage of attacks against me voiced by your campaign spokespersons and others seemed petty so i did not respond. \" however, corfman decided to write the open letter after hearing moore's own remarks last night at a rally in henagar, his first public appearance in nearly two weeks. Moore on monday gave no new insight on the allegations that have hounded his campaign for the past 21/2 weeks, saying again the accusations he made unwanted romantic or sexual advances on teenage girls almost 40 years ago are \" completely false. \" \" i don't know any of ( the women ), \" he said. Corfman has said that when she was 14 moore, who was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, took her to his home where he removed her clothes and touched her over her bra and underwear.

        "summary": "One of the world's most popular apps has just added strong end-to-end encryption, making the communications of 1 billion users off-limits to wiretaps and potentially setting up a us legal battle bigger than the apple-fbi clash. Whatsapp has been steadily increasing encryption over the last 18 months and with its latest update, text messages, attachments, and voice calls can only be deciphered by the recipient, meaning that it would be impossible for the facebook-owned company to comply with wiretap orders, the guardian reports. The encryption was built by a relatively small team of engineers, including renowned cryptographer moxie marlinspike. Given the scale, this is a \" landmark event \" for privacy advocates, writes a blogger at fortune. Whatsapp founder jan koum grew up in soviet-era ukraine, and he says one of the company's core beliefs is to protect the private communications of its users, most of whom are outside the us. \" we're somewhat lucky here in the united states, where we hope that the checks and balances hold out for many years to come and decades to come, \" he tells wired. \" but in a lot of countries you don't have these checks and balances. The argument can be made: maybe you want to trust the government, but you shouldn't because you don't know where things are going to go in the future. \" he says that while the decision to encrypt was made before facebook acquired whatsapp, \" if they were not supportive of us, we wouldn't be here today. \"",

But a second-year student at michigan technological university says he witnessed his trashed roommate do something a little more unusual late saturday: design an entire aircraft, with no memory of it in the morning, the guardian reports. Keith fraley, 19, tells the paper that \" mark \" ( who doesn't want to use his real name in case future employers don't approve of his drinking adventures ) stumbled into their room at about 11: 30pm to grab some textbooks, returning minutes later for his whiteboard. Around 1: 30am he was back, rambling \" like a slurred robot \" about his creation, which he described as an ekranoplan, a \" ground effect \" vehicle that hovers over water. The guys mark was drinking with as he \" frantically \" whipped up his aerospace math calculations tell fraley that mark was \" very intoxicated \" and \" was passing out on his whiteboard from time to time \" as he worked. Amazingly, mark says he can't recall a thing: he woke up the next morning \" basically questioning his sanity because of the immense amount of work that was in front of him, \" fraley says. The tweet fraley sent out about his roomie's feat — in which he marvels, \" so my roommate came back drunk last night and doesnt remember designing an entire f --- ing airplane \" — has also taken off, with more than 81,000 retweets and 133,000 favorites so far. Responses range from critiques of the design to admiration to outright envy, with one commenter tweeting, \" i need to know wtf he was drinking!! \" but would the aircraft actually function? fraley tells the guardian: \" mark says... He looks forward to trying to re-create his work into a remote-control model with his colleagues. \" ( maybe a wasted engineer designed this \" evil \" airplane seat. )",

        "summary": "Cal worthington, famous in southern california for the outlandish tv commercials advertising his car dealership, died sunday at age 92. Worthington, who bought his first la-area dealership in 1950, started making the commercials in an attempt to drum up business because his location wasn't so hot, the new york times reports. He starred in the ads, which sometimes aired as many as 100 times a day, often performing stunts such as standing on a biplane's wing as it flew, riding a killer whale, or driving around in a golf cart with a tiger. Often the ads — at one point, as many as 40 of them were filmed per week and they aired 50,000 times per year — would feature his \" dog \" spot, who was never actually a dog. ( he was played at various times by a gorilla, a lion, a bull, and a penguin, among other animals, the los angeles times reports. ) all the while, his jingle played in the background: \" go see cal, go see cal, go see cal. \" ( interestingly, worthington himself never owned a car, he just borrowed one from his lot. ) worthington was born in oklahoma and grew up in poverty, eventually leaving school at 13 to sign on with the civilian conservation corps and later enlist in the army air corps during world war ii, during which he flew b-17 flying fortresses. He couldn't become a commercial pilot because he didn't have a college degree, so he bought a gas station in texas and tried his hand at selling used cars there before ending up in california. In addition to the ads, worthington once had his own live tv show two nights a week; \" cal's corral \" featured performers including johnny cash. Worthington's notoriety led to tonight show appearances and even roles in one film and a tv show — and, of course, a lot of cars sold. Worthington estimates he sold more than a million; at one point he had a multi-state empire of 29 car dealerships. But \" i never much liked the car business, \" he once said. \" i just kind of got trapped in it after the war. \"",

A new supplement called uqora is a powder you mix with water when the risk of a uti seems high — after strenuous exercise or sex, for example, reports mashable. Its main ingredient is called d-mannose, which is a sugar that binds with e. Coli bacteria that cause the vast majority of utis ( it will not work on the smaller number of cases caused by other bacteria ), sweeping them from your bladder when you pee. It also includes vitamins and a diuretic to help speed up that urination. The company was founded by jenna ryan, who suffered eight infections in 2014 and became so frustrated by her lack of options outside of antibiotics that she partnered with a molecular biologist ( her own partner, as it happened ) to sort out a solution that could help fend off an infection. ( elite daily reports that out of all infections treated in ers in the us, only pneumonia is treated more frequently. ) while it's backed by a board of three doctors, uqora is a supplement and thus doesn't have to meet the strict standards of the fda.

We also never thought we'd be describing a face tattoo as a \" pleasant surprise. \" and yet, there really is no better way to talk about justin's latest ink: resting up for the show in philly it's gonna be a good one mark my words a photo posted by justin bieber ( @justinbieber ) on may 7, 2016 at 2: 15pm pdt more from the stir: 10 of the hottest celeb instagrams of 2015 ( photos ) theoretically, that teeny spot on his face could just be dirt. Or, like, a mole we never noticed before. But tattoo artist jonboy valena instagrammed justin's face from another, better lit angle, and it does, in fact, look like",
            "\"i ' m sorry little girl, it's just too much pressure for me to take a photo with yo – whoa! where did you even learn the word shitlocks? \" it's springtime, which for justin bieber apparently means clearing out the clutter in his life. He buzzed off his stephen baldwin in bio-dome hair and took a mental inventory of all things that were dampening the namaste in his life. Assuming he's getting rid of the most severe problem first, we now know the biggest stressor in justin bieber's life is taking ten seconds to stand next to a crying pre-teen while she snaps a selfie. You're a dick, universe. An abnormally large for a skinny white boy dick. A photo posted by justin bieber ( @justinbieber ) on may 10, 2016 at 3: 15pm pdt you might be thinking \"eh, amy schumer freaked out like this but quickly realized she was overreacting. \" but amy schumer apparently has thicker skin than canada's douchiest export ever will, because he's not backing down from this at all. Justin bieber's just gonna do him for a while, you guys. He's going to keep making decisions that are \"fit for his growth, \" you know, like tattooing his face. Which if i understand it"

According to the new york daily news, cameron and minta burke were off to vegas to celebrate minta's 40th birthday with their two children on may 3. They say a birthday cake, part of their carry-on luggage, was placed in an overhead bin until a flight attendant asked them to move it to a different compartment, before finally deciding it belonged under their seats. Now enter a second flight attendant, says cameron, who began berating the first airline worker, and then him. \" she said i was being non-compliant, \" recalls burke. \" i said, 'miss, have you been drinking? ' because her behavior was irrational, and she stormed off. \" the burkes were then asked to leave the flight, and when they refused, police officers from jfk airport boarded to investigate, which can be seen in a video recorded by the family. One can be heard telling the family that nobody did anything wrong. Jetblue then asked all passengers to leave the plane in order to remove the family. Abc news reports that the airline issued a statement countering burke's story, saying the family refused to move the cake, and \" became agitated, cursed and yelled at the crew, and made false accusations about a crew member's fitness to fly. \" the burkes, who managed to book a flight via united the next day, plan to file a lawsuit. \" we were just so happy, \" says minta. \" all of a sudden this occurred, and my two children are screaming, crying. \"",

Barr later issued a joint statement with rabbi shmuley boteach, saying they regret abc chose to kill off the roseanne conner character. \" that it was done through an opioid overdose lent an unnecessary grim and morbid dimension to an otherwise happy family show, \" they said in the statement, accusing the network of being \" unwilling to look past a regrettable mistake, thereby denying the twin american values of both repentance and forgiveness. \" most initial reviews of the the conners were positive, however.

In another blow to the media mogul, who told the leveson inquiry that he had never tried to influence any prime minister, campbell's diary says murdoch warned blair in a phone call of the dangers of a delay in iraq. The disclosure by campbell, whose diaries are serialised in the guardian, will pile the pressure on murdoch in light of his evidence to the leveson inquiry. The cabinet office released information on friday that raised doubts about murdoch's claim that gordon brown pledged to \" declare war \" on news corporation after the sun abandoned its support for labour in september 2009. It supported brown's claim that he never made such a threat by saying that the only phone call between the two men during the period took place on 10 november 2009 and focused on afghanistan. Murdoch tweeted in response: \" i stand by every word is aid [ sic ] at leveson. \" but there will be fresh questions about one of murdoch's most memorable declarations from his appearance before the inquiry in april.

            "Rupert murdoch joined in an \" over-crude \" attempt by us republicans to force tony blair to accelerate british involvement in the iraq war a week before a crucial house of commons vote in 2003, according to the final volumes of alastair campbell's government diaries. In another blow to the media mogul, who told the leveson inquiry that he had never tried to influence any prime minister, campbell's diary says murdoch warned blair in a phone call of the dangers of a delay in iraq. The disclosure by campbell, whose diaries are serialised in the guardian, will pile the pressure on murdoch in light of his evidence to the leveson inquiry. The cabinet office released information on friday that raised doubts about murdoch's claim that gordon brown pledged to \" declare war \" on news corporation after the sun abandoned its support for labour in september 2009. It supported brown's claim that he never made such a threat by saying that the only phone call between the two men during the period took place on 10 november 2009 and focused on afghanistan. Murdoch tweeted in response: \" i stand by every word is aid [ sic ] at leveson. \" but there will be fresh questions about one of murdoch's most memorable declarations from his appearance before the inquiry in april.

Patients who received such kidneys were more likely to be alive eight years later than those who remained on dialysis or those who waited for a deceased donor, according to research published in the new england journal of medicine. Experts say the breakthrough could help tens of thousands of people who have antibodies hostile to transplanted organs, which makes finding compatible kidneys almost impossible in some cases. \" we used to say if you had a compatible donor, you could do a transplant. Now you can say, if you have an incompatible donor, we still can make that transplant happen, \" senior study author dr. Dorry segev of johns hopkins university tells reuters. \" that's very exciting to those on the waiting list. \" the chances of rejection remain higher with the \" incompatible \" kidneys, but the research shows that getting a new organ quickly outweighs the benefits of spending years on dialysis waiting for a compatible one. Segev says \" desensitization \" comes at a cost — up to $ 20,000 for the procedure and thousands more every year for drugs — but it is extremely cost-effective when compared to $ 100,000 a year for dialysis.

Reuters/keith bedford a long-term study found that transplant recipients whose immune systems were technically incompatible to the donated kidney - because they had so-called anti-hla antibodies - were more likely to be alive eight years later than people who did not receive a transplant or waited to get an organ from a deceased donor. \"we used to say if you had a compatible donor, you could do a transplant.

        "summary": "\" the only reason i wouldn't go to some parts of new york is the real risk of meeting donald trump, \" boris johnson once said — but that was 13 months ago, before he became britain's top diplomat and trump became president-elect. Johnson was in new york over the weekend for what officials say were \" positive but frank \" talks with top members of trump's transition team, the bbc reports. Trump has met with united kingdom independence party leader nigel farage at least three times since the election but this was the transition team's first face-to-face meeting with a british government minister. Johnson is due to meet congressional leaders including paul ryan and mitch mcconnell on monday. The guardian notes that while johnson strongly criticized trump before the election, once accusing him of \" betraying a quite stupefying ignorance, \" he changed his tune after the election, calling for an end to the \" whinge-o-rama \" over the president-elect. While johnson was in new york, prime minister theresa may spoke to sky news, saying trump's remarks about women were \" unacceptable, \" but noting that he had apologized for them. \" but the relationship that the uk has with the united states is about something much bigger than just the relationship between the two individuals as president and prime minister, \" she said. Hours earlier, trump tweeted that he was looking forward to meeting may later this year, adding: \" britain, a longtime us ally, is very special! \"",

The city just played a trump card, though: it capped the sewer at the house of 50-something robin speronis, so now she ' ll have to figure out a way to dispose of her waste by other means, reports the news-press. She vows to do so, and she similarly vows to fight a judge's order to hook up to the city water supply. \"i know how to live off the grid completely and in a sanitary way, \" says speronis, who began living without most city utilities more than a year ago thanks to solar panels and treated rainwater. The city slapped her with a slew of ordinance violations after fox 4 did a story about her lifestyle, and the case made it to court last week. A judge gave speronis 30 days to reconnect to city water, noting that she'd been using the sewer system without paying for it. After the hearing, the city capped her sewer, a move she calls \" pure evil. \" but a spokesperson says the city had no choice: speronis hasn't been paying for the service and made clear she had no intention of doing so.",

Author evan thomas discovered the letter while doing research for a book on o ' connor to be published in march, titled first. By the time o ' connor received it, however, she'd been dating future husband john o ' connor for a little over a month. There don't seem to have been any hard feelings. When rehnquist graduated a semester early and left for a supreme court clerkship, o ' connor wrote that the class \" hated to see him leave \" despite his \" brilliant career ahead. \" it all worked out for rehnquist, who married nan cornell in 1953, the year after o ' connor tied the knot. According to thomas, rehnquist later described his wife as the only woman he ever loved. But o ' connor remained his close friend throughout life. Npr reports rehnquist was even among those to suggest her when president ronald reagan went looking for a supreme court nominee in 1981.

        "summary": "On april 22, a 210-foot oil tanker signaled its position off the west coast of africa, not far from its destination of senegal. What transpired over the next two weeks is shrouded in mystery. The \" ghost ship \" washed ashore in robertsport, liberia, far from the intended port of dakar, on may 3. Two days later, the liberian coast guard ( lcg ) and country's maritime authority boarded and searched the tamaya 1 and found the crew had vanished. The country's ministry of national defense now says the ship had been \" gutted by fire, leaving the bridge ( upper and control center ) burned along with all documents, \" per frontpageafrica. Further, only one of the two lifeboats on the tanker, reported as sailing under the nigerian or panamanian flag, was located by the lcg. One last breadcrumb: the lcg heard from the maritime regional monitoring rescue coordination center that the tanker was seen by some fishermen to be in possible distress four days after its final signal. And that signal shouldn't have ceased, reports motherboard, which explains tankers must regularly electronically transmit their position, speed, and direction for safety reasons. A marine monitoring expert tells the site two things could have transpired: the device could have been intentionally disabled, or it may have broken ( but should have then been repaired ). As for the flak liberia is catching for the two-day period it was reportedly unaware of the ship's presence on its shore, a national port authority source tells the liberian daily observer that robertsport's lack of seaport contributed to the delay. ( an adventurer's mummified body was found aboard a drifting yacht in february. )",

The measure needed 60 votes to clear a procedural hurdle, but it failed with a 43 to 57 vote that had every democrat and independent voting against it, along with nine republicans, the hill reports. The republicans voting no included moderate sens. Susan collins and lisa murkowski, along with conservatives including sens. Rand paul and mike lee.

The new york times calls the gop's failure to get even 50 votes on tuesday night's measure an \" ominous sign \" for the party's hopes of passing legislation this week. Sen. John mccain, who returned to the senate to cast a deciding vote in favor of debating healthcare legislation, voted in favor of the repeal-and-replace amendment, though he criticized the secretive process that created it. \" asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition — i don't think that's going to work in the end, and probably shouldn't, \" he said.",

While previous studies have shown spanking can have negative effects on child development in the short term, carlo's study found children who faced physical discipline in infancy could continue to see negative effects into their teen years. The study looked at data from 1,840 mothers and children. Information was collected on children at 15 months old, 25 months old, and in fifth grade. The study found that african-american children who were severely punished at 15 months were more likely to be delinquent and aggressive in fifth grade. They were also less likely to help others. However, the study didn't find the same link in european-american children. \" our findings show how parents treat their children at a young age, particularly african-american children, significantly impacts their behavior, \" carlo says.

        "summary": "A massive recall, followed by a $ 50 million wrongful-death settlement payment last year, seemed to mark the beginning of the end for an ikea disaster that left several toddlers dead after they were crushed by dressers that fell on them. But npr reports yet another toddler — said to be the eighth child who's died due to an ikea-linked tip-over — has been killed. A press release notes that while 2-year-old jozef dudek was in his bedroom in buena park, calif., on may 24, put down for a nap by his dad, a malm dresser fell on top of him; his father found jozef underneath the dresser when he went to check on him. One of the dudeks ' attorneys says jozef's parents had no idea their dresser was part of the recall, while another, alan feldman, says the recall was \" poorly publicized by ikea and ineffective in getting these defective and unstable dressers out of children's bedrooms. \" ikea has been offering either refunds for the returned furniture, or a wall-mounting kit to secure the dressers and chests. In what seems apparent, a statement from an ikea rep cited in the philadelphia inquirer says the dresser in jozef's room was not attached to the wall. The inquirer goes on to note that, per a consumer product safety commission report filed for the period ending jan. 1, about 882,500 dressers had been recalled — around 3 % of the total affected by the recall. The director of the kids in danger nonprofit says ikea should be doing more to promote the recall, telling abc news: \" we have to do better, because these are just ticking land mines in a child's bedroom. \" feldman, the dudeks ' attorney, says in his statement that \" jozef's death was completely avoidable, had ikea adhered to safe design standards. \"",

On assignment with time to cover operation desert storm in 1991, jarecke persuaded his military public affairs officer to let him photograph the so-called \" highway of death \" in southern iraq, where us forces decimated retreating iraqi fighters. \" if i don't take pictures like these, people like my mom will think war is what they see in movies, \" jarecke remembers saying. \" it's what i came here to do. \" the officer \" could have stopped me \" because it wasn't allowed \" under rules of the pool, \" jarecke said, \" but he didn't stop me. \" jarecke snapped many photos of the convoy, but his most memorable one captured a soldier staring dead ahead, charred alive as he reached through a broken windshield. A ceasefire was called that very day, so jarecke's photo moved on to news editors in new york city without military approval. But the ap yanked the photo from its wire service, and time and life refused to run it, saying families and children read their magazines. Critics have since accused the us media of \" sanitizing \" desert storm ( \" as far as americans were concerned, nobody ever died, \" said a photo editor ), a stark contrast to the era of brutal vietnam war photos that galvanized the public and won pulitzer prizes. As jarecke put it in 1991, \" if we're big enough to fight a war, we should be big enough to look at it. \" ( see how the guardian's head of photography deals with shocking photos, or read about a war photographer fired for altering a photo. )",

Forbes has now revised the estimated net worth of the company to $ 800 million taking into account the $ 724 million of capital raised. Holmes and her theranos execs have vigorously denied claims that the company's tests are unreliable and have made statements that they are cooperating with the relevant authorities to resolve the issues. As would be expected for hollywood's most in-demand leading lady, lawrence has a bunch of projects in the pipeline.

In a letter to john boehner, lew said the government will be unable to pay its bills unless congress passes a debt limit bump by oct. 17. On that day, the government will be down to its last $ 30 billion, which \" would be far short of net expenditures. \" the date is essentially in line with what congress expected, politico reports. Yesterday, lew told a bloomberg summit that investors seemed a little too confident that a deal would come. \" people have to take seriously the fact that congress has a lot of work to do. \" some analysts are starting to do just that, business insider reports. One dc-based analyst today estimated that there is a 40 % chance of a default — and he's basing the other 60 % on \" blind faith. \" on the bright side, moody's yesterday said that hitting the ceiling probably wouldn't prompt a us credit rating downgrade, reuters reports.",

The river's strong current caught aleh kalman of sacramento on saturday afternoon as he swam about 150 feet upstream from the falls, cooling off after hiking the park's popular mist trail with his church group. Witnesses saw kalman slide over the precipice around 2: 45 p.m. Park personnel, aided by a california highway patrol helicopter, were unable to find kalman on saturday afternoon or evening, calling off their efforts as darkness fell. They returned in the morning, with about 20 searchers and several trained dogs scouring the boulders below the waterfall.

        "summary": "In 1988, ed graf was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for killing his stepsons joby, 9, and jason, 8, in 1986 by locking them in a shed, dousing it with gasoline, and setting it on fire. Everything was there to prove the case against the texas man, per an exhaustive analysis in slate: the motive ( a failing marriage he reportedly wanted to save, financial problems that may have been solved with the boys ' life insurance policies ), loads of circumstantial evidence, and his less-than-stellar reputation ( he was said to be a bad husband, father, and employee, accused of embezzlement ). There was also the arson science used as evidence against him — \" junk science \" that's since been debunked and that led to graf's retrial last year, thanks to a push by texas fire experts to review old arson cases based on fire-science advances, many of which present a compelling case for graf's innocence. What the retrial hinged on: whether jurors would lean toward the strictly scientific strategy of graf's new defense team or toward the prosecution's circumstantial evidence, motive, and emotional witness testimony. Using the new arson standards, fire experts now said it was more likely the boys were playing with fire and left the shed door open while the fire burned ( if the door had been closed, there wouldn't have been enough oxygen to fuel more than a flash fire ). Others mention the high carbon monoxide levels in the boys ' blood, suggesting it couldn't have been a gas fire intentionally set by graf, since those fires burn out quickly. The final result, after a deadlocked jury with two holdouts, was shocking: graf suddenly pleaded guilty — right before the jury decided he was guilty — taking advantage of an obscure legal loophole based on time served that even the prosecutor didn't know about and that set him free on parole eight days after his plea.

        "summary": "Nicotine-replacement therapies are often a lifesaver for former smokers who want to make sure they kick the habit forever. But while gum and patches may do the trick for certain ex-inhalers, there's a product that, its loyal followers say, is the only smoking-cessation remedy that's worked for them: nicorette-brand lozenges. But manufacturer glaxosmithkline halted production on the lozenges last year due to \" quality-control \" sizing problems at its south carolina factory, the washington post reports, leaving consumers in the lurch and going to desperate lengths to stock up and hoard the pills. The lozenges, while deemed safe to sell by retailers who still had supplies left, were described as \" overly thick, overly soft, and sub and superpotent \" in fda files. La tv writer bob berens, 36, who quit smoking seven years ago, recently browsed amazon in search of the \" magic \" lozenges, per the post. A box of 108 was going for $ 122, bringing out in berens the same craving and feeling of \" powerlessness \" he used to feel when he was addicted to cigarettes. ( our own quick newser search found a box of 72 for $ 71 — with only three left in stock. ) and nyc's austin rodrigues, who bought a small amount of glaxo stock a couple of years ago, started leaving messages with the company, hoping he'd get some answers as a stockholder ( he says he didn't ). But berens, rodrigues, and others rationing out their final supplies may not have to wait much longer: gsk says that despite \" lengthy corrective actions \" to address the production issues, it expects the mini lozenges to be back on shelves by april, and the full-size ones sometime later this year, the post notes.

        "summary": "Karen klein had to put up with a shocking amount of bullying from students on the school bus where she works as a monitor — but thanks to the power of the internet, her story has a happy ending. A 10-minute video of klein being bullied to the point of tears went viral this week, though it's hard to get through even one minute of it as kids are heard constantly taunting and berating the new york grandmother of eight. The video was initially caught on a cellphone camera and uploaded to facebook, then placed on youtube by an uninvolved party — where it has so far racked up more than 1.5 million views. The disturbing video inspired an online fundraising effort to send klein on vacation — and so far, more than $ 261,000 has been raised ( with the amount increasing constantly ). \" i was trying to just ignore them, hoping they would go away and it doesn't work, \" klein tells the rochester democrat and chronicle. \" trust me, they didn't go away. \" though two similar videos were eventually found after the school district opened an investigation, klein insists, \" the kids weren't always that bad. \" she didn't report the incident, and an investigation was launched only after the video went viral yesterday; students are now being questioned by police. A particularly poignant detail: klein is hearing-impaired and did not hear all of the jeers at the time. She makes just $ 15,506 a year, according to the fundraising campaign, and is considering taking her whole family on a disney cruise with her new-found riches. The 25-year-old reddit user who started the campaign says it has exceeded his expectations, adding, \" maybe she could retire on this. \"",

At 38,000 feet, the boy — who authorities now say is 15, not 16 as earlier reported — had to survive extremely thin air as well as temperatures as low as 80 below zero. There was also the risk of falling out, or being crushed by moving parts of the landing gear. \" it's amazing, \" a curator at the national air and space museum tells nbc. \" he's very, very lucky to be alive. Something like that happens only once in a long time. \" most people wouldn't last more than a few minutes at that altitude, he says, and the \" few survivors almost all have been very young males who were presumably fairly fit. \" more: the teen survived thanks to a fluke of conditions where it \" got cold enough to protect his brain, but not cold enough to stop his heart, \" director of the institute for altitude medicine tells the washington post. The boy almost certainly spent almost the entire flight unconscious in a hibernation-like state, he says. The faa says there have been 105 recorded wheel-well stowaways since 1947. Only 25 of those survived, and only a handful of those survivors were ever at altitudes higher than 30,000 feet. Fbi officials say the boy, who ran away from his santa clara home after an argument with his family, didn't know where the plane was going when he climbed into the landing gear, reports the los angeles times. \" he was not planning on going to hawaii, \" a spokesman says. \" he just got on a plane. \" he was turned over to child protective services after passing a medical check and has not yet been charged with a crime. At san jose airport, meanwhile, officials are investigating how the boy was able to sneak onto the plane, the ap reports. Surveillance cameras captured him crossing the tarmac and climbing into the landing gear, but the security breach wasn't discovered until the boy was found in hawaii and authorities reviewed the footage.",

The affidavit alleges that oliva uploaded 22 images of children younger than 10 engaged in sex acts \" with each other or with adult males \" to an email account registered to him. City spokeswoman sarah huntley says police are focusing on the new case, though they're not ruling anything out in the jonbenet case. Oliva was often near the ramseys ' home in 1996 ( some soup kitchens he visited were nearby ) and was questioned in 2000 when police arrested him on a drug charge and found a picture of the girl in his backpack, along with a stun gun and poem he had written called \" ode to jonbenet. \" the \" murder touched me very deeply, \" oliva told the denver post in 2002. The papers note that some investigators in the case suspect a stun gun was used on jonbenet.

Gary howard oliva, 52, was booked without bond into the jail friday on a case brought by the boulder police department, the same agency that has labored for two decades to bring resolution to the christmas night 1996 murder of the 6-year-old child beauty queen. The affidavit for oliva's arrest alleges that in april he uploaded to a google email address 20 or more images of graphic child pornography. Some images featured a girl estimated to be between 4 and 7 engaged in sexual acts with an adult male whose face is not seen.

        "summary": "In what some of his critics on the right saw as a decision as bad as looking at the eclipse without glasses, president trump announced monday night that he is going against his \" original instinct \" and reaffirming the us commitment in afghanistan instead of pulling troops out. Trump had long described america's longest war as a quagmire, but he will now become the third american president, after george w. Bush and barack obama, to send more troops there, reports usa today, which notes that trump's address to a military audience at fort myer is one of more than a dozen times since 2001 that presidents have announced a new approach in afghanistan. A roundup of coverage: breitbart, now with steve bannon back in charge, accused trump of a \" flip-flop \" in a banner headline. An opinion piece accused trump of \" obeying his mcmaster's voice, \" warned that his base would not be pleased with an \" open-ended, vague commitment to this foreign quagmire, \" and stated that trump's strategy and rhetoric is now very similar to obama's. Officials tell the new york times that trump's decision came after months of pushing from military figures in his administration with experience there. They warned that an american pullout could create a haven for isis and that more troops were needed, while bannon favored withdrawing troops and relying on the cia and private contractors for counterterrorism operations. Cnn looks at five key parts of trump's afghan strategy, including giving us forces more autonomy to fight the taliban and stopping pakistan from harboring terrorists from groups like the haqqani network. Insiders tell the washington post that defense secretary james mattis, national security adviser hr mcmaster, and white house chief of staff john kelly, who lost a son in afghanistan, were the key voices that changed trump's mind. The sources say mcmaster tried to convince trump that afghanistan was not a lost cause by showing him a 1972 photo of women walking around kabul in miniskirts. The ap reports that trump's speech is getting mixed reactions in afghanistan, though many are pleased that he decided to speak out against pakistan. Trump's approach may be the right decision, though his plans seem to be \" more of the same \" with little chance of ending the 16-year-conflict, according to the los angeles times editorial board. \" given the alternative, trump is right to try to stabilize the situation in afghanistan, \" they write. \" but it's hard to be optimistic about where that will lead. \"",

There, investigators found the buried remains of donald webb in the yard of his ex-wife, lillian webb, the boston globe reports. Authorities say donald webb vanished nearly 40 years ago after shooting and killing a police officer in saxonburg, penn., during a traffic stop on dec. 4, 1980. Webb was charged with first-degree murder and on dec. 31, 1980, a federal warrant was issued for his arrest alleging unlawful flight. In 1981 webb was placed on the fbi's ten most wanted list. Authorities believe webb shot chief gregory adams while planning a jewelry store heist. He was wanted at the time for an attempted burglary in new york. The massachusetts attorney general's office said the search of lillian webb's home was part of an ongoing illegal gambling investigation, the washington post reports. Last year investigators searched the property and found a secret room with a walking cane inside, arousing suspicion. Lillian webb has not spoken to reporters since the discovery and the globe reports that she received immunity for her cooperation. Donald webb, who would have been in his 80s today, was a career criminal with ties to the rhode island mob. He specialized in robbing jewelry stores and was part of a gang of thieves in massachusetts known as the fall river gang, which authorities say had ties to the patriarca crime family, the herald news reports. Authorities believe webb died about 17 years ago; the cause of death is not yet clear but investigators say it does not appear he died violently, wtae reports.",

She was joined by bill and chelsea clinton as well as lady gaga at the rally, which marked her fourth state of the day. A round-up of coverage: the new york times reports that an earlier clinton rally in philadelphia, where she was joined by president obama, michelle obama, and bruce springsteen, was her biggest event of the whole campaign, with a crowd estimated at 33,000. The ap reports that clinton and trump are not among the 50 million americans who have already voted. Clinton will vote in chappaqua, ny, while trump will vote in new york city. Running mates tim kaine and mike pence have returned to their home states to vote. Politico reports that at his grand rapids rally, which finished around 1am, trump spoke of the \" new adventure of making america great again \" but admitted defeat was a possibility. \" if we don't win, this will be the single greatest waste of time, energy, and money in my life, \" he said. \" we have to win. \" in its final pre-election analysis, reuters gives clinton a 90 % chance of winning, predicting that it will all be over for trump if he fails to win at least two of these three states: florida, michigan, and pennsylvania. The hill takes a look at the situation in several battleground states, including michigan, which has \" become the center of the political universe \" in the final days of campaigning. The los angeles times reports that both candidates will be spending election night in new york city, which police describe as a huge security challenge. The rival election night parties will be 15 blocks away from each other in manhattan. In interviews with voters, the times found that clinton and trump supporters have at least one thing in common: they say they're \" totally ready for this election to be over. \"",

        "summary": "A recent united nations report that warned the assad regime is \" exterminating \" civilians in syria at alarming rates is an understatement compared to a new report from the syrian center for policy research. While other un numbers, which the group stopped collecting in mid-2015, indicated at least 250,000 had died during the nearly five-year conflict, the scpr's \" confronting fragmentation \" analysis paints a more \" catastrophic \" picture: 470,000 dead from the war and almost 1.9 million wounded, meaning 11.5 % of the country's population has been killed or injured from the continuing crisis. Of the deaths, the report attributed about 400,000 to violence, with the remainder due to war-induced conditions such as hunger and illness. Life expectancy, meanwhile, has plummeted from 70.5 in 2010 to just over 55 in 2015. And while the human toll in syria is devastating enough, the country has been rocked in almost every other way as well: the report — which is careful not to criticize the syrian government or its allies directly, per the guardian — notes that \" infrastructure and institutions, human and physical capital, and the wealth of the nation have almost all been obliterated. \" estimates put the overall economic loss so far at $ 255 billion. About 45 % of syrians have fled their homes, with 3.1 million refugees and 1.1 million migrants taking off for other countries in search of better lives. \" human development, rights, and dignity have been comprehensively ruined, \" the report reads, cynically adding: \" despite the fact that syrians have been suffering for … five years, global attention to human rights and dignity for them has intensified only when the crisis has a direct impact on developed countries'societies. \" ( russia is now calling for a syrian ceasefire — but not until march. )",

When trump ran for president, however, knox supported hillary clinton and wrote columns against his policies. As a result, trump is \" very upset \" with her, per the new york times, and his supporters rail against knox for what they view as disloyalty. At the very least, they argue, she could have remained silent. In the la times piece, knox pushes back against that sentiment. \" what do i owe trump? a thank you for his well-intentioned, if undiplomatic, support, \" she writes. \" so for the record: thank you, mr. President. \" beyond that, forget it. Knox writes that loyalty can be a dangerous thing — it may unite people in a common cause, but it can blind them as to whether that cause is just. \" by holding personal loyalty above all else, trump and some of his supporters create a political environment where reason and justice hold little sway, \" she writes. Knox points out that while trump supported her case abroad, he did the opposite closer to home in the case of the central park five. He called for the death penalty despite flimsy evidence, and still views those men as guilty even though they were exonerated years after the fact. For reasons like that, she can't support trump politically. Yes, she owes him her thanks, but what does she owe her country? \" civic engagement, careful consideration of issues that affect my fellow citizens, and support for policies that deserve support, even if it makes the president'very upset.

        "summary": "It was supposed to be one of the signature elements of his second term, but a court ruling today raises the possibility that president obama's sweeping immigration reform won't begin until after he leaves the white house — if it begins at all, reports the washington post. The setback came courtesy of a federal appeals court, which refused to lift a lower court's order blocking obama's executive actions while a lawsuit filed by texas and 25 other states makes its way through the courts. \"because the government is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its appeal of the injunction, we deny the motion for stay, \" said the judges in their 2-1 decision. The white house could appeal to the full 5th circuit court of appeals or to the supreme court, reports the hill. Obama's executive actions would shield an estimated 5 million immigrants from deportation, including young immigrants known as \" dreamers \" who were brought here illegally as kids. They also would allow the parents of us citizens or legal permanent residents to apply for work permits, though they do not provide a path to citizenship, notes the la times. States say the president overstepped his authority, and texas gov. Greg abbott today tweeted that \" texas just won the executive amnesty case at the 5th circuit court of appeals, \" adding, \" the constitution wins. \" the white house, however, said \" two judges of the fifth circuit chose to misinterpret the facts and the law in denying the government's request for a stay. \"",

After joking that in into the woods, \" sleeping beauty just thought she was getting coffee with bill cosby, \" the co-hosts started doing competing impressions of cosby as pudding-pop pitcher — except they replaced \" pudding pops \" with \" pills. \" \" this was a rape joke with a point, \" writes kornhaber, \" a statement of support for accusers who have been maligned and had their motives questioned. \" and with those impressions, fey and poehler were trying \" to redefine cosby's public persona permanently. \" on salon, jenny kutner agrees. Fey and poehler managed to make \" a rape joke that doesn't joke about rape, \" she writes, and in doing so they were \" refreshing and transgressive in joking about something that's all too often joked about in the wrong way. \" making the whole thing even more powerful, she notes, is the fact that so many people are still attempting to defend cosby and push this whole issue under the rug. The audience was visibly and audibly shocked when fey and poehler started down the cosby road, but these were the same celebrities talking about the importance of charlie hebdo all night, \" ostensibly supporting the power of humor to highlight the problems of our world.

Our first priority is to make sure that the state gets money, \" he said. \" it is critical, and to do that, we need to make sure we raise the debt limit. \" asked about trump's past threats to force a government shutdown if congress does not also include his $ 1.6 billion request for a wall on the u.s.-mexico border, mnuchin said harvey aid was trump's \" first objective right now, \" the ap reports. Trump visited storm-ravaged areas in texas on saturday, expressing hope for speedy congressional action on relief aid. But some house conservatives have said directly pairing it with an increase in the debt limit would be a \" terrible idea \" that sends the wrong message on overall government spending. Trump plans to meet with congressional leaders from both parties this week. On sunday, texas gov. Greg abbott described the federal aid package as an important initial \" down payment \" on harvey relief that he expects will come to $ 150 billion to $ 180 billion. Per politico, abbot added that the damage wrought is more comparable in scale to hurricane katrina than sandy. \" we have over 5 million people who were affected by this, \" he said, noting recovery would require \" even more than what was funded for katrina, which was about $ 120 billion. \"",

How \" david \" of alberta ( who requested anonymity ) did it: he got a doctor's note saying he identifies as a woman and arranged for a gender change on his birth certificate and driver's license. That status change allowed him to modify his gender to \" female \" on his auto insurance policy for lower premium payments. ( the national post notes that david also put up a disclaimer on reddit saying he has \" gender dysphoria, \" though it suggests he may have done so for legal cover. ) the move worked because in canada, men under 25 are seen as a higher collision risk and charged higher premiums. In david's case, that meant as a man he'd pay $ 3,500 annually on his chevy cruze; as a woman, $ 2,600. \" i was pretty angry about that, \" says david, who the cbc notes is in his early 20s and has one car crash and a couple of tickets to his name. \" and i didn't feel like getting screwed over any more. \" it's now even easier for someone to do what david did, as the need for a doctor's note for a paperwork gender change has since been eliminated for adults in canada. The insurance industry might find a claim like david's to be fraudulent, and the transgender community isn't thrilled with his stunt. David, however, says he simply wanted to show how unfair the system is and to save money, not to \" ridicule transgender or lgbt rights. \" the eu's highest court, meanwhile, ruled in 2011 that gender as a factor in determining premium rates is \" discrimination \" — a view david shares. \" i now pay...

That report has been picked up widely, but as the huffington post notes, it's not actually clear who's won the legal battle. The bbc says that what actually happened is that last month, minogue's team withdrew her opposition to jenner's trademark application, which indicates some sort of settlement was reached between the two parties. Neither side is telling the press what happened. Two things are clear: one, that jenner did get at least one rejection from the us patent and trademark office ( last year it rejected her request to trademark her full name; her lawyers appealed that decision last month ). And two, that twitter is rejoicing over kylie minogue's apparent win, with tweets like this available in abundance: \" very happy that @kylieminogue will be forever known as kylie and @kyliejenner will be known as a'secondary reality television personality.

After a long and heated battle, the kylies may have reached a settlement.

But what that means for both sides is unclear, despite reports. Teen reality star kylie jenner and australian pop idol kylie minogue have been locked in a dispute over jenner's request to trademark \"kylie \" for months. Jenner's lawyers originally filed her request with the u.s. Patent and trademark office in 2015, but, since she's not the only famous kylie out there, she faced a big hurdle.

Colombia's government and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia, or the farc, on wednesday announced that they had a deal to end a conflict that has claimed 220,000 lives. An overview: the bbc has the key line from the joint statement: \" the colombian government and the farc announce that we have reached a final, full, and definitive accord. \" the ap reports the final text of the agreement hasn't been released, but it will see the government moving forward on aggressive land reforms and making heavy investment in long-neglected rural areas. The farc will abandon their arms and be guaranteed a handful of seats in congress for the next decade. Here's a particularly prickly element: \" under a so-called transitional justice system, all but the most grievous crimes [ committed by the rebels ] may be resolved with reduced sentences, \" writes the times. As a senator in the party of former president alvaro uribe put it, \" they will spend zero days in prison, they will be awarded with political representation. This deal breaks the rule of law. \" uribe is a key figure in all this. The accord isn't a done deal: colombia reports outlines a number of steps that will follow. The big one is a \" plebiscite, \" essentially a referendum that puts the deal in the hands of the colombian people. Uribe is leading the \" no \" camp. The vote, \" the most important of our lives, \" says president juan manuel santos, will be held oct. 2. Reuters reports polls lean toward it passing, but there are potential pitfalls. Here's one, per the ap: voter turnout. The accord doesn't just need a majority \" yes, \" it also has to be supported by at least 13 % of those eligible to vote, or about 4.4 million people.",

The change hinges on \" assortative mating, \" the notion that people marry others with similar values, lifestyle, education, and earnings potential. The trend rose early last century, declined in the middle decades, and has returned with a vengeance. Now fewer women are aiming for breadwinners and men for homemakers, a division of labor that once brought classes together. Today, there's a perfect storm that keeps uptown folk with uptown folk. Women's pay is rising — up from 52 % of men's pay in 1970 to 78 % today — so marriage is more about finding a like-minded companion than someone to divide the labor, according to research from the university of michigan. What's more, people meet more often at work and marry later in life, with a better sense of the other's prospects. They can also find \" just the right mate \" on tinder and match.com, the times reported last year. Not to mention that married people already have a financial head start: \" people who are married tend to be more advantaged, and on top of that, more advantaged people are marrying people like themselves, so those people tend to be doubly advantaged, \" says schwartz.

We present evidence on some of the driving forces causing these changes in the marriage market: the rise of the birth control pill and women's control over their own fertility; sharp changes in wage structure, including a rise in inequality and partial closing of the gender wage gap; dramatic changes in home production technologies; and"

Israel lost the king of david. There is no other word to describe this man, they don't make people like this anymore, \" one mourner said, as per the ap. Current pm benjamin netanyahu eulogized sharon thusly at a cabinet meeting today, reports the jerusalem post: \" arik was first and foremost a fighter and a commander, one of the greatest military men the people of israel has seen in modern times and in its history. \" israeli political luminaries including president shimon peres and former pm ehud olmert, who succeeded sharon after his 2005 stroke, were among those who paid respects today. But, as politico notes, sharon's controversial legacy made paying tribute something of a dicey matter, with president obama issuing this bland statement: \" as israel says goodbye to prime minister sharon, we join with the israeli people in honoring his commitment to his country. \" the timing is particularly tricky, given netanyahu's turbulent history with sharon, as john kerry works to hammer out a peace \" framework \" between israel and the palestinians in the coming weeks.
