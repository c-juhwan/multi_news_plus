The fourth installment of this robot-smashing series, transformers: age of extinction, is getting the nod from just 20 % of critics on rotten tomatoes.

Here's what the critics had to say: \" do you ever think to yourself, gee, i wish someone would beat on my skull with a hammer today? if so, you're in luck, \" writes tom long at the detroit news. Essentially, it's two hours and 45 minutes of \" absolute garbage. \" it's \" repetitive beyond belief, soulless, and shamelessly, endlessly chaotic. \" \" to give bay his due, transformers is a testament to advances in cgi, \" david hiltbrand explains at the philadelphia inquirer.

Following north korea's successful test of its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb earlier this month, the south korean military has announced it's creating an assassination unit called the spartan 3000 to carry out night raids in north korea. Once in the north, the group could be tasked to kill the leadership — primarily kim. It could go in early and preempt a north korean attack on the south, or fight in the middle of a war. South korean defense minister song young-moo told lawmakers of the government's intention to build the \"decapitation unit \" on september 4, the day after the recent nuclear test. The administration wants the team ready by the end of the year. The unit is central to a longstanding plan to fight north korea if necessary — called \"korea"

Dylan noble, 19, was killed in fresno, calif., on june 25 after police responded to a 911 call about a man walking around with a rifle. While in the area, officers pulled over noble's pickup; they say noble was \" peeling out \" and continued to drive after they signaled him to stop. After pulling into a gas station, noble got out of his truck and walked toward the officers. The video shows him repeatedly ignoring officers ' commands to stop and to show both his hands. Officers believed noble, who repeatedly reached toward his waistband, was armed; they ultimately shot him twice after he yelled \" i [ expletive ] hate my life \" and continued toward them. After \" pleading \" with him to show both hands, officers shot him two more times while he was already on the ground. It was ultimately determined that what noble had in his hand was a 4-inch-by-4-inch piece of clear plastic with something resembling gray clay inside; the department of justice is analyzing it. Fresno police chief jerry dyer says the department is investigating and that he will focus on whether the third and fourth shots were \" absolutely necessary. \" as the washington post reports, soon after noble's death, people pointed out on social media that the shooting wasn't getting as much attention as the deaths of alton sterling and philando castile, presumably because noble was white. ( at a vigil the day after his death, there were confederate flags and a \" white lives matter \" sign present. ) now noble's father tells the guardian the new video shows police were \" trigger-happy, \" and his mother has started the process of suing the city, the bee reports.

        "summary": "Egypt's new president arrived in iran today for a historic visit, the ap reports — and he promptly sparked a walkout at the nonaligned movement summit. Mohamed morsi, the first egyptian leader to visit iran since tehran cut diplomatic relations with egypt in 1979 over its peace treaty with israel, praised the syrian rebels — thus angering the syrian delegation, which left the meeting. Morsi called the syrian uprising a \" revolution against an oppressive regime, \" the bbc reports, and called for the nonaligned movement to support it. More from the summit: un secretary general ban ki-moon, whose presence at the summit is bugging the us, met with iran's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and president mahmoud ahmadinejad yesterday to ask that iran, one of the syrian regime's last remaining allies, try to get the syrian government to end the violence. But khamenei insists the government should continue to be armed while the rebels should have no weapons, reports the ap. Khamenei also insisted iran is not interested in developing nuclear weapons, but will continue to pursue nuclear energy, reuters reports. \" our motto is nuclear energy for all and nuclear weapons for none, \" khamenei said, calling nuclear weapons \" a major and unforgivable sin. \" but the wall street journal reports that an iranian scientist considered to be a nuclear weapons guru a la robert oppenheimer has resurfaced after a few years off the job. Mohsen fakhrizadeh is back at work, un investigators find, prompting more concern over iran's nuclear agenda. Fakhrizadeh's work had been frozen in 2006; he is believed to be running a nuclear weapons-minded research facility in the suburbs of tehran.",

The rule will be in place until at least the end of march, reports the bbc. The local reports the plan is to relieve the rule in july, august, and september — the situation is poorest in winter, falcone says — but most pizzerias and bakeries will be forced to change their fuel sources, buy expensive filters, or face fines up to $ 1,100. \" shocking, it's so ridiculous, \" a rep from a local pizzeria tells il mattino. \" we make about 34 pizzas a day, how do they think we are responsible for the pollution problems around here? \" \" we can't be the cause of the smog, \" a local who protested outside san vitaliano's town hall on sunday adds, per corriere della sera. \" naples has many more pizzerias than san vitaliano but doesn't have the same pollution levels.

For 192 hours and 25 minutes — or almost nine days — beginning feb. 23, opposition members of parliament rambled on in an attempt to block an anti-terror bill proposed by a member of the governing party, report the bbc and korea times. The goal was to get to the end of the parliamentary session on march 10, but the filibuster came to a close wednesday after attacks by the country's leaders. The bill passed hours later. At least the lawmakers still have something to show for their efforts: they smashed the world record for filibustering set in 2011 when canadian lawmakers delayed proceedings for 57 hours. The last speaker alone spoke for 12 hours and 31 minutes to claim the record for longest individual filibuster in south korea. Speakers wore running shoes, thumbed through huge stacks of documents, read academic articles and online comments on privacy infringement in their entirety, and recited sections of george orwell's 1984, per yonhap news. It was unsurprising, then, that the parliament chair was caught sleeping. The lawmakers argued the anti-terror bill — allowing for the collection of data, including phone records, on people considered security risks — would violate privacy rights, but president park geun-hye said the filibuster was \" nothing more than a dereliction of duty. \" the public was also peeved that the stunt held up bills regarding north korean human rights and an upcoming election.",

Police have framed the attack as random, though many have speculated over whether there was racial motivation involved. And in the aftermath of nia's death, a national conversation has emerged around race that has reeled in some big-name celebs and brought a thoughtful post from anne hathaway that's generating headlines. The timeline: outrage erupted and f-bombs got lobbed over oakland news station ktvu's coverage of wilson's death. Its report featured a photo of wilson from her facebook page; in it, she appears to be holding a gun. The daily dot notes wilson's page featured \" tens of other photos \" that could have been used in place of that image. Many said the choice fueled a larger trend involving the criminalization of black victims. And it wasn't even a gun. As shaun king explains in a lengthy facebook post, it was just a cell-phone case with a gun handle, \" basically a gag – and the local news showed it like it said something about nia's character....

The lateral frontal pole is a newly identified part of your brain which, scientists believe, helps us recognize when we've made poor decisions. \" there are a few brain areas that monitor how good our choices are, and that is a very sensible thing to have. But this region monitors how good the choices are that we didn't take, \" notes rushworth. Researchers zeroed in on the lateral front pole by scanning 25 people's brains using two imaging techniques. Putting the scans together helped the scientists learn about connections between the ventrolateral frontal cortex — which deals with language and cognition — and the rest of the brain, the guardian reports. From there, the experts divided the ventrolateral frontal cortex into 12 regions, and then scanned monkeys ' brains looking for those same regions. The scans indicate that monkeys have 11 of them — but only humans have the lateral frontal pole, science 2.0 reports. In other words, the site notes, it's part of \" what makes us human. \" ( more brain news: older brains aren't weaker. )",

        "summary": "Pope francis is days away from releasing what the guardian predicts will be \" his most radical statement \" yet, and he says it isn't just for catholics. Francis will be accompanied by an atheist climate scientist and a greek orthodox theologian, as well as a vatican cardinal, when he releases his long-anticipated letter on the environment on thursday, the ap reports. The encyclical, a rare papal \" teaching letter, \" is expected to focus on climate change, humanity's role in causing it, and its devastating and disproportionate effects on the world's poor, reports the new york times, which notes that francis has long been outspoken on environmental issues and told reporters earlier this year that \" man has slapped nature in the face. \" in a recent speech seen as a preview to the encyclical, francis made it clear that he believes climate change and the suffering of the poor is the result of capitalism and overconsumption, the guardian reports. \" much of the world remains in poverty, despite abundant resources, while a privileged global elite controls the bulk of the world's wealth and consumes the bulk of its resources, \" he said. Climate scientists say since the issue has become an ideological and partisan one as much as it is a scientific one, the papal letter could do more than international negotiations this year to reduce emissions, usa today reports. ( a us conservative group claims francis has been \" misled \" on the issue, and staunch catholic rick santorum says he finds the church leader hard to listen to. )",

Following years of abuse, evie, born a man, decided to leave cross-dressing behind after a friend was brutally murdered in 1985, the ap reports, in an exclusive look at her predicament and the situation in indonesia at large. Though the lifestyle is very much in the public eye — a major talk-show host is transgendered — attacks have mounted in recent years, and the country's top islamic organization has condemned the transgender lifestyle, the ap reports. \" they must learn to accept their nature \" or \" accept their fate to be ridiculed and harassed, \" says a top cleric. As a child, evie dropped out of school and pursued a career in cooking, eventually finding work as a cook for obama's mother in 1969. During that time, she became a de facto nanny to an 8-year-old barack and sister maya. And though she often went out at night dressed as a woman, \" i never let him see me wearing women's clothes. But he did see me trying on his mother's lipstick, sometimes. That used to really crack him up. \" but after the family moved away, evie fell on hard times and ultimately became a sex worker.

The dallas morning news reports that on friday, the board held a preliminary vote and decided to nix hillary clinton from high school history class. As the first woman to nab a major political party's presidential nomination, clinton appeared alongside thurgood marshall and sandra day o ' connor, among others, in a \" citizenship \" section of the curriculum in which students were tasked to \" evaluate the contributions of significant political and social leaders in the united states. \" a work group made its recommendations to the board based on a rubric it created on how \" essential \" it was to learn about certain historical figures. Also cut, but from the elementary school curriculum: helen keller. \" helen keller does not best represent the concept of citizenship, \" the group wrote. \" military and first responders are best represented. \" by the group's gauge, clinton received just 5 points out of 20; keller got 7. Some wonder how much time will really be saved by nixing these notable figures. \" it won't take that long to teach about either woman. They happen to be part of history, \" tweeted pundit greta van susteren. The work group estimates cutting clinton will save about 30 minutes of teaching time, while yanking keller will free up 40. What the boe voted to keep in the state curriculum: references to \" judeo-christian values \" and \" a requirement that students explain how the ' arab rejection of the state of israel has led to ongoing conflict ' in the middle east, \" per the morning news. These decisions aren't set in stone: there's still a chance for the boe to make changes before a final november vote.",

President donald trump isn't included in the list by name, but students are required to learn about texans who have been president, governor and mayor. Earlier this year, the work group split up and each subgroup took a set of figures to grade using the rubric, said the two teachers, who both said they wanted to keep politics out of the decisions. \" there were hundreds of people \" kids had to learn about, misty matthews, a teacher in round rock, told the news. \" our task was to simplify.... We tried to make it as objective as possible. \" jana poth added that the work group did \" not want to offend anyone \" with its choices. \" but there's too many [ figures ], \" she said. Third-graders, for example, should learn about three dozen figures.

The briarcliff daily voice reports she had planned to leave colon island, where she was staying, to go to red frog beach on bastimentos for the day; authorities were alerted when she didn't return to her hostel, and her body was found by a police officer days later in a wooded area near bastimentos'shore. The daily news calls johannet a \" globetrotting scarsdale woman, \" and her brother paul elaborates on that in a facebook post. \" she was a world traveler — by the age of 23, she had already visited 6 continents and innumerable countries, including a recent 18-month trip to vietnam where she taught english literature to local students. \" panamanian investigators, in concert with the fbi, on tuesday conducted raids on the area as part of their investigation, though no details have been given regarding them or whether there are any suspects.

That nickname is \" xi dada, \" or \" big daddy xi, \" and while the intent of the moniker was, as another guardian article frames it, to \" craft the image of an approachable public servant, \" it seems to have instead created a cult of personality that some fear is reminiscent of mao zedong. Sources tell bloomberg that both the xinhua news agency and the 21st century business herald were \" cautioned \" last month about using \" xi dada, \" even though the name doesn't appear to have been blocked from online searches or scrubbed online, and no explicit written ban seems to have been issued. The nickname got its start after a fan club started circulating it in 2012, per the people's daily, and xi himself gave it the thumbs-up in 2014. There's even a series of songs that have been dedicated to big daddy xi, including \" our xi dada \" and \" xi dada loves peng mama \" ( referring to his wife ). \" i thought the chinese system had moved beyond one-man-rule and personality cults, \" noted chinese scholar david shambaugh scoffs to the guardian. \" i do not think it is good for china. This is not the 1960s. \" experts speculate it's that sort of thinking that may have caused officials to try to pull back the name, even blocking the economist website for posting a cartoon xi in a mao-style getup next to the headline, \" beware the cult of xi. \" some say xi is likely not pleased. \" that's a big-time propaganda failure, \" the author of a book on xi's rise tells the guardian. \" i can imagine that in their five-minute-a-month meeting with xi jinping, the head of publicity got told: ' whose bright idea was that [ nickname ]? send him or her to gansu [ in china's far west ]!

        "summary": "Now even the great apes are getting in on debunking \" fake news \" — or, to be more specific, fake beliefs. German researchers have found that the primates can tell when a human is wrong about something, and can even help to remedy the situation, which in this case was assisting a human in finding an object mistakenly believed to be in one location but actually in another, afp reports. The study published in the plos one journal, which revamped a test usually administered to 18-month-old human babies, sought to see if the 34 chimps, bonobos, and orangutans at germany's leipzig zoo could understand if a human was harboring a false belief, believed to be a sign of advanced social cognition apes weren't previously believed to possess. A press release lays out the experiment, which involved the apes watching while person a put an object under one of two boxes, then either stayed in the room and watched ( the \" true belief \" part of the experiment ) or left the room ( the \" false belief \" part ) while a second person then moved the object to the second box. In both cases, person a then went to the original box to try to open it, ostensibly not knowing in the false-belief cases the object had been moved — and in those false-belief cases, the apes, who'd been observing the whole thing and had been trained to unlock the boxes, tried more often than would be attributed to chance to guide the humans to where the object really was. These results are said to be the first to show that apes can use this \" mind-reading \" and apply it to their social interactions, the researchers write. ( an animal expert says it's moral to keep apes in a zoo. )",

        "summary": "The toddler in the extra-large t-shirt was sitting between sliding glass doors at amarillo airport when a security guard found her late one night in september 1977, clasping a bottle of spoiled juice. Faded bruises signaled a troubled past, one from which the blonde, brown-eyed girl, aged 16 to 18 months, had been abandoned. Dubbed jane doe 927, the toddler was adopted by a loving family and rechristened shelley schooley. Her past would remain a mystery for four decades. Now the amarillo globe-news reports a dna test could unlock those secrets. That is, if the mother of two decides to take it. Until now, schooley says, she never wanted to pursue her \" missing link. \" in a 2015 youtube video, schooley explains, \" it's never mattered to me. I have my family and i wouldn't trade them for anything. \" meanwhile in 1998, a woman named pattie whitaker posted on a genealogy forum that she \" will not give up \" searching for her niece, bonnie lee webster, who disappeared in 1977. The 18-month-old was apparently abandoned by whitaker's late sister, who never explained what happened to the child. Genealogy sleuth rona randall saw the post and found an old newspaper photo of jane doe 927 — a \" perfect match \" to baby bonnie. Last month, randall found schooley and put her in touch with whitaker. Schooley tells the globe-news she can't justify the expense of the dna test with two sons to raise. But, she adds, she may do it if the truth provides \" closure \" for whitaker, her probable aunt. \" that would be the only thing i feel i have to offer, \" she says. ( parents held out hope their missing daughter was still alive. She wasn't. )",

The new book is by former seal team six leader chuck pfarrer, who says he interviewed the team that killed bin laden. The book says seals landed on the roof, not the ground floor, bursting right into osama's bed chamber, according to advance looks from the daily beast and telegraph. Only 12 bullets were fired in the entire raid. But team members confirm there was no kill order, and that they would have captured bin laden if possible. Perhaps more damaging for the obama administration is the assertion that the seals resent the president for announcing bin laden's death so quickly. If he hadn't, they believe they could have used intelligence from the raid to launch surprise attacks on al-qaeda leaders — potentially rolling up the organization in six months. Us officials, however, have dismissed the book as \"plain wrong. \"",

Gallmann, known for her bestselling book i dreamed of africa, which became a movie by the same name starring kim basinger, was patrolling the ranch in laikipia when she was shot in the stomach, says a local police chief. The 73-year-old gallmann had been with rangers assessing damage done to her property; lodges belonging to gallmann were burned by the herders last month. She was airlifted to the capital, nairobi; a family member reportedly said gallmann is in stable condition after surgery but had serious injuries. The ap reports the east african nation is facing a drought that has affected half the country and has been declared a national disaster. The bbc reports it's believed tens of thousands of cattle have been pushed onto private lands; laikipia's roughly 4,000 square miles are home to some of kenya's biggest white landowners. Npr's eyder peralta described the situation like so: as nomadic herders have moved in, \" the kenyan government launched a military-style operation to push the herders out. But what we've seen is an escalation of violence. Police have killed lots of cows. And the herders have responded by burning tourist lodges on the properties. \"",

A cab driver kidnapped and almost murdered by the escapees, however, won't get a share of the reward money because the supervisors decided that he had not provided information that led to the men's recapture.",

The battle had pitted rebels, backed by some palestinians, against palestinian fighters of the pro-assad popular front for the liberation of palestine-general command ( pflp-gc ). Many pflp-gc fighters defected to the rebel side and their leader ahmed jibril left the camp two days ago, rebel sources said. \"all of the camp is under the control of the ( rebel ) free syrian army, \" said a palestinian activist in yarmouk. He said clashes had stopped and the remaining pflp fighters retreated to join assad's forces massed on the northern edge of the camp. The battle in yarmouk is one of a series of conflicts on the southern fringes of assad's capital, as rebels try to choke the power of the 47-year-old leader after a 21-month-old uprising in which 40,000 people have been killed.

It follows two friends, one of whom has recently lost her father to suicide and her lover to another woman. Here's what critics are saying: queen of earth is a \" startling, razor-sharp thriller \" that might solidify perry as \" the most skillful young writer-director working in the united states today, \" writes calum marsh at village voice. \" largely a chamber piece for two women — katherine waterston and elisabeth moss, both excellent in hugely demanding roles — the film also welcomes, and indeed earns, persona comparisons. This is vigorous, frightening, electrifying stuff. \" scott tobias at npr was rapt all the way through. The film focuses on the \" thorny relationship \" between catherine ( moss ) and virginia ( waterston ) over a week. It \" isn't a thriller per se, but it has the tension and atmosphere of one, only with emotional violence substituting for the physical kind, \" he writes. \" catherine's deterioration feels dread-soaked and dangerous, and it happens with the agonizing deliberateness of a suspense director pulling the strings. \" waterston \" easily holds your attention, \" but it's moss, \" with her intimate expressivity, who annihilates you from first tear to last crushing laugh, \" writes manohla dargis at the new york times. She's \" sensational, \" and \" brings tremendous depth of feeling \" to her difficult role, dargis adds. As for the movie, it's \" alternately mesmerizing and suffocating … bringing you uncomfortably close to the action... Only to shove you away. \" joe neumaier agrees \" this is moss'show. \" she's \" excellent as a woman whose mind is unraveling \" in a film that \" burrows so deep into a psyche that it's scary. \" the \" intense \" work \" may seem minor but is more than memorable \" as it explores \" memory, relationships and codependency, between both friends and lovers, \" he writes at the new york daily news.",

He'd say yes, then slip an 800-page book that clearly \" had yet to be opened...

Next, it was off to lunch. \" corn writes that he learned many lessons from hitchens, but \" never how to function in quite this manner.

Onoda, the last japanese soldier to surrender, hid out in the jungles of the philippines for almost 30 years after 1945, only coming out of hiding in 1974. The straggler formally surrendered — still wearing his uniform — to philippine president ferdinand marcos after his former commander flew out to rescind his 1945 order that onoda stay there and spy on american forces, the ap reports. The new york times reports that onoda was with three comrades on lubang island when the war ended; believing leaflets attesting to the war's end to be allied propaganda, they lived off bananas, coconuts, stolen rice, and cows they killed, and constructed bamboo huts. One of the men surrendered five years later; the others were shot and killed by police, the last just two years before onoda emerged. The guardian reports that he \" wept uncontrollably \" when he eventually gave up his rifle — still \" perfectly serviceable \" after all those years, and one he may have used to kill as many as 30 locals that he mistook for enemies. A japanese government spokesman praised onoda for his unbreakable spirit: \" after world war ii, mr. Onoda lived in the jungle for many years and when he returned to japan, i felt that finally, the war was finished. That's how i felt. \" after the war finally ended for him, onoda bought a ranch in brazil before returning to japan to run a children's nature school. \" i don't consider those 30 years a waste of time, \" he said in a 1995 interview. \" without that experience, i wouldn't have my life today. \" ( in other wwii news, the game monopoly actually helped pows escape. )",

An unidentified friend of trump's tells the ap the new president handed over his phone thursday on the advice of security advisers. The new york times reports trump's android was replaced by an encrypted device that received secret service approval. Barack obama, the first president to use a mobile device in office, started with a \" heavily modified \" blackberry before moving to a mostly disabled iphone. The devices were used to check email and news sites but rarely — if ever — for phone calls. This is all likely to cramp trump's style. A republican senator says the president was known for answering his phone even if he didn't recognize the number. He would even call back strange numbers that didn't leave a message. A former secret service agent tells cnet trump is unlikely to be able to use his new device for phone calls because they are way too easy to intercept. Trump's aides — some of whom are excited journalists and others won't have direct access to him — say he's likely to instead go office to office in person to get his \" gossip \" fix.

The phone comes with a new number that is known only to a limited number of people. This marks a big change for trump, who's frequently on the line with friends, business contacts, reporters, foreign leaders and politicians. Larry johnson, who worked at the secret service from 1982 to 2006, said a smartphone given to a president would have extremely limited uses. \" it's not really good for much, \" he said. It's possible trump's twitter account would be operated from another phone, said johnson, who now works as an executive at cybersecurity company",

The call went to voicemail and the reporter did not leave a message. About an hour later, trump called back. It's hard to imagine many politicians — particularly one about to become president of the united states — calling back an unknown number on their cellphone. With trump, it's simply how business gets done, whether he's fielding calls from real estate partners and longtime friends or foreign leaders and congressional lawmakers in the weeks after the election.

            "Pool, getty images who's got two thumbs and a secret service-approved phone to tweet from? on arriving in washington on thursday ahead of his inauguration, donald trump handed in his android device in exchange for an unidentified locked-down phone, according to the associated press. The phone comes with a new number that is known only to a limited number of people. This marks a big change for trump, who's frequently on the line with friends, business contacts, reporters, foreign leaders and politicians. Larry johnson, who worked at the secret service from 1982 to 2006, said a smartphone given to a president would have extremely limited uses. \" it's not really good for much, \" he said. It's possible trump's twitter account would be operated from another phone, said johnson, who now works as an executive at cybersecurity company",

Trump arrived in washington the day before his inauguration as the nation's 45th president in a swirl of cinematic pageantry but facing serious questions about whether his chaotic transition has left critical parts of the government dangerously short-handed. Mr. Trump will be sworn in at noon eastern time on friday, but his team was still scrambling to fill key administration posts when he got here on thursday, announcing last-minute plans to retain 50 essential state department and national security officials currently working in the obama administration to ensure \"continuity of government, \" according to sean spicer, the incoming white house press secretary.

The call went to voicemail and the reporter did not leave a message. About an hour later, trump called back. It's hard to imagine many politicians — particularly one about to become president of the united states — calling back an unknown number on their cellphone. With trump, it's simply how business gets done, whether he's fielding calls from real estate partners and longtime friends or foreign leaders and congressional lawmakers in the weeks after the election. But as trump prepares to take the oath of office friday, the future of his ever-present android smartphone is now a matter of national security. On thursday, he told a friend that he had given up his phone"

Consider this your pregame report, with info from politico, mother jones, and the des moines register: the frontrunners: polls show ron paul, mitt romney, and rick santorum are poised to grab the proverbial \"three tickets out of iowa. \" romney doesn't need to win to remain the favorite for the nomination, but anything less than a respectable second will be damaging. Turnout is everything: if it's high, that's probably a good sign for romney. If it's low, it's a good sign for paul and/or santorum — depending on where it's concentrated. Bad weather is thought to favor paul's band of enthusiastic supporters. Location, location, location: romney's support is strongest in eastern iowa, santorum should fare well in the northwest, and paul is hoping for turnout in college towns such as ames. Politico highlights 10 counties to watch here. The battle for fourth: if either newt gingrich or rick perry can pull out a closer-than-expected fourth, they might be able to stay in the race. Last-minute campaigning: romney held rallies in four cities yesterday, his most since 2008. Paul held forth in a hotel full of journalists in des moines, hoping to grab media buzz. And santorum appeared with the cast of 19 kids and counting, the tlc reality show beloved by iowa homeschoolers. Some intriguing numbers: paul's favorability has fallen 21 points in the past week. Only 76 % of santorum's supporters say they ' ll definitely caucus for him. Romney, meanwhile, has at some point trailed five different candidates in iowa — and is now polling at exactly the same 18 % he was at in january.",

        "summary": "Geneva talks on syria's future have been tense — and new us support for rebels isn't helping. On monday, reuters reported secret congressional approval of funding to lightly arm \" moderate \" syrian rebels through september. An opposition adviser reported an \" outburst \" by the syrian government's lead negotiator, bashar al-jaafari, after which the un's leading mediator called off the day's discussion, the new york times reports. Talks resumed today, the bbc reports. Syrian officials say the us is backing terrorists — which the us calls \" ludicrous \" — and that its support for the rebels conflicts with its diplomatic efforts in switzerland. The times reports yesterday's afternoon session was axed to give the government time to come up with a transitional blueprint of its own. The bbc adds government reps did share a \" declaration of basic principles, \" but absent from it was any statement on a political transition. And negotiators haven't even been able to achieve the basic goal of suspending fighting in homs to bring in humanitarian aid. If talks don't move forward soon, the times notes, western officials may seek help from the un security council, hoping that an image-conscious russia won't exercise its veto ahead of the olympics. Meanwhile, in syria itself: various rebel groups — including al-qaeda-linked extremists — have gotten hold of the lion's share of oil and gas supplies, us officials tell the times. Extremist groups are actually selling the resources to the government, with some getting electricity or a break from airstrikes as payment, opposition activists say. They're using the resulting cash to support clashes not just with bashar al-assad's forces, but with each other. Syria is poised to miss a chemical weapons deadline next week, insiders tell reuters. By then, the country is supposed to have sent all such weapons abroad to be destroyed. But so far, just 4.1 % of some 1,300 metric tons of chemical agents have been sent to the relevant port in latakia, the sources say.",

In a press release, the riverside county sheriff's office says a 17-year-old girl called 911 early sunday morning after escaping a home in perris and told police her 12 siblings were being held captive by their parents. Police say that inside the residence, they found several malnourished and dirty children \" shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings \" — and parents david and louise turpin were \" unable to provide a logical reason \" why they were restrained. Investigators initially thought the couple's 13 children were all juveniles, but they were shocked to discover that seven were adults and the oldest was 29. David turpin, 57, and louise turpin, 49, were arrested on charges of torture and child endangerment and are being held on a $ 9 million bond each, the los angeles times reports. The 13 victims — the youngest just 2 years old — were hospitalized. Police say they gave them food after they said they were starving. Horrified neighbors tell the press-enterprise that they had no idea what was going on. Some didn't even know there were children in the house. A joint facebook page shows the turpins, accompanied by their children, renewing their wedding vows in las vegas.

Below is davis ' comparison of the vanquished owner to the popular film and more. Baron davis on donald sterling and playing for the clippers: for me, i say this — and i said this a million times — the day at my press conference when i walked up the stage, the head of communications said, 'hey, you know, he may say some things to you.

And the las vegas man has been at it for six years, using a dozen computers and a slew of accounts to help beef up the followings of his 50-or-so clients, who pay him to help them seem more popular and important, reports the wall street journal. And the accounts have gotten more sophisticated: in april, a tough new filter was applied, and the majority of vidmar's accounts were wiped from the site. And so the vendors that sell the fakes to vidmar put a little more work into them: the fakes now feature photos, profile details, and tweet a number of times before he buys them; he got 1,000 for $ 58 from a pakistan supplier this month. From there, he has the accounts tweet, retweet, follow, and message — all in the name of clients like \" rapper/singer/producer/guitarist/fitness model \" dave murrell aka @fyrare ( number of twitter followers: 238,360 ). Murrell has tried twitter ads, but says he gets more bang for his buck with vidmar. Murrell doesn't exactly express any qualms: \" if you're not padding your numbers, you're not doing it right. It's part of the game. \" and it's not just follower count that can be affected: client tony benson ( aka rapper philly chase ) says vidmar's fake accounts pushed him onto the \" trending topics \" list and eventually sparked the noticed of philadelphia media. Buying and selling both accounts and followers is, of course, barred by twitter's terms of service, but vidmar notes he has never been contacted or threatened with legal action by twitter.",

Forensic analysis shows that teeth taken from at least four of the 12 corpses discovered during excavation for a rail line contained trace amounts of plague dna, indicating exposure. Early burials found at the site, from the late 1340s, are nice and orderly, with bodies wrapped in white shrouds, but skeletons from a second outbreak in the 1430s are tossed in with what appear to be upper-body injuries — evidence of \" a period of lawlessness and social breakdown, \" phys.org reports. Among other significant details: several skeletons suffered from malnutrition and 16 % had rickets. Many had back damage, signalling stressful manual labor. Analysis of one victim is amazingly detailed: he was born outside of london, breastfed, had bad tooth decay as a boy, and worked in manual labor before dying as a young man of the black death. Archaeologists suspect that thousands more black death victims lie nearby, and a dig is planned for this summer. Dna experts are analyzing the plague genome in victims'teeth in case there's more to learn about the disease, which still kills 2,000 people per year ( when antibiotics aren't applied within four days ). \" it is useful information that could warn and avert potential epidemics and pandemics, \" says a london scientist.

I grew up drinking vernors and watching ballgames at michigan &amp; trumbull. Cars got in my bones early. And not just any cars, american cars. When the president of american motors died suddenly in 1954, my dad, george romney, was asked to take his place. I was 7 and got my love of cars and chrome and fins and roaring motors from him. I grew up around the industry and watched it flourish. Years later, i watched with sadness as it floundered. Three years ago, in the midst of an economic crisis, a newly elected president barack obama stepped in with a bailout for the auto industry.

New faces should be recruited from unrelated industries — from companies widely respected for excellence in marketing, innovation, creativity and labor relations. The new management must work with labor leaders to see that the enmity between labor and management comes to an end. This division is a holdover from the early years of the last century, when unions brought workers job security and better wages and benefits. But as walter reuther, the former head of the united automobile workers, said to my father, \"getting more and more pay for less and less work is a dead-end street. \" photo you don't have to look far for industries with unions that went down that road.

        "summary": "A prehistoric fortress is home to a much later structure: what may be one of the biggest medieval palaces ever discovered, one whose remnants remain buried beneath the ground, the independent reports. The site in southern england is surrounded by huge earthworks that date to the iron age. Researchers used ground-penetrating radar and other technology to investigate what's under the grass within the inner and outer baileys of the former fort, the bbc reports. Without doing any digging, they found a large complex that leading medieval-building expert dr. Edward impey believes is an early 12th-century castle. It measures about 560 feet by 210 feet and features 10-foot-thick walls and what appears to be a 200-foot-long great hall, the independent notes. \" the prime candidate for constructing it is perhaps henry i, \" says impey. \" archaeologists and historians have known for centuries that there was a medieval city at old sarum, \" notes survey leader kristian strutt, \" but until now there has been no proper plan of the site. \" the archaeologists'survey uncovered residential areas, evidence of kilns or furnaces, and an open area — \" perhaps for mustering resources or people \" — near some large structures, per a press release. \" from this we can piece together a detailed picture of the urban plan, \" says strutt. The iron age fort at the site was likely built around 400 bc and taken over by romans in 43 ad, the bbc notes. But by the onset of the 13th century, the city built in the same place became too tight and weather-beaten for habitation and was abandoned in favor of today's salisbury, which is located roughly two miles away. ( another ' lost city ' was recently investigated using similar techniques in cambodia. )",

        "summary": "China has resumed its shipment of rare earth minerals to the united states, after cutting us off early last week, the new york times reports. Shipments to japan, which have been suspended since september due to disputes involving the arrest of chinese fishermen, also resumed, though they are facing some delays. The decision came hours after an announcement by secretary of state hillary clinton that she would travel to china tomorrow to discuss the matter. She called the suspension a \"wake-up call, \" saying the us and japan need to find alternate supplies of these materials. China, which produces 95 % of the world's rare earth minerals, has repeatedly downgraded its export levels of these materials over the last five years; what it currently ships is well below world demand.

But just how rich ross really is is now up in the air, forbes reports, noting it's yanked ross off its billionaires list after a one-month probe revealed that $ 2 billion or so or ross ' alleged fortune \" never existed, \" and that ross had engaged in an \" apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications, and whoppers \" with the magazine going back 13 years. The discovery came when ross, 79, contacted forbes in october to refute his ranking: last year he was listed with a net worth of $ 2.9 billion on the forbes 400; he claimed he was worth closer to $ 3.7 billion. Then forbes talked with 10 of ross ' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \" penchant for misleading \" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \" wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth, \" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \" he's lied to a lot of people. \" the magazine delves into ross ' back story, including how, when he first made the forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $ 1 billion, \" everyone that i knew that worked with wilbur knew it wasn't true, \" per a former colleague. When forbes told ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about — in the amount of \" more than $ 2 billion, \" assets ross said he put into the trusts sometime \" between the election and [ my ] nomination. \" when forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, ross cited \" privacy issues \" — and the magazine lays out other problems with ross'story on the supposed $ 2 billion transfer.

But the black-footed cat of southern africa can hunt the grasslands like no other, live science reports. The pbs series super cats follows them on nightly forays, showing how they hunt and explaining why they kill more prey in a night than a leopard does in half a year. German zoo curator luke hunter helped by fitting several black-footed cats with radio collars, enabling the crew to track them in tall grasses. \" if you're a gazelle or a wildebeest, a black-footed cat isn't at all deadly, \" says hunter, who has studied the cats since the 1990s. \" but those success rates make them the deadliest little cat on earth. \" and the black-footed cat has tricks. It can hunt by bounding randomly through grass, sneaking up on prey in a weaving pattern, or waiting patiently by burrows for a meal to emerge. They can \" wait for up to 2 hours, absolutely immobile, just silently waiting at the burrow for a rodent to appear, \" hunter says. \" and then they nab it. \" they kill 10 to 14 small birds and rodents nightly, or about one every 50 minutes — a constant hunt necessary to supply their active metabolisms. Like most felines in the series, the black-footed cat is endangered, but hunter accentuates the positive: \" i believe it's mostly not doom and gloom, \" he says, but \" if we don't work to reduce those threats, then we could lose some of these animals. \" see the episode at pbs.

Two of mount sinai's patients were in intensive care, another was still undergoing treatment, seven had been discharged and a few more were still in the emergency room as of about 3 p.m, hincks said. Chicago police said the drugs were purchased primarily at two locations on the west side, one of"

        "summary": "You know those copies of usa today that sometimes get left outside your hotel room door? apparently they're not free, at least not at the hilton garden inn sonoma county airport, which one guest learned to his dismay. Now rodney harmon has filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the hilton chain over the 75-cent charge, the san francisco chronicle reports. Harmon says he stepped over the paper as he left the room. But a few days later, he noticed a small warning on his key card pouch informing him of the charge, according to the new york times. \" he did not request a newspaper and assumed it had been placed there by hotel staff, \" reads harmon's suit, which adds that the hotel allegedly tried to hide the charge by listing it in an \" extremely small font which is difficult to notice or read \" on the key sleeve. Further, the suit accuses the hotel of an \" offensive waste of precious resources and energy, \" since newspaper readership is down and most of the papers left for guests probably don't get read. Though the 75 cents is \" a piddly sum, \" writes ben popken at the consumerist, \" the case could have big implications if it becomes the impetus to sue other hotel chains, since many hotels do just the same thing. \"",
