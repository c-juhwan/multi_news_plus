        "summary": "Michigan is going to have the first legal recreational marijuana in the midwest. The detroit free press projects a comfortable victory for the ballot proposal to make the state the 10th to legalize recreational pot. A similar measure in north dakota, however, appears destined for defeat, though legalize nd campaigners say they won't concede until all votes are counted — and if the measure does fail, they will try again in 2020, the grand forks herald reports. In other ballot measures: transgender rights. Voters in massachusetts said yes to question 3, which upholds a 2016 state law allowing transgender people to use the public facilities, including restrooms and locker rooms, of the gender they identify with, wbur reports. The yes on 3 campaign says the state is the first \" to successfully defend transgender rights by popular vote. \" fracking. Oil and gas interests in colorado expressed relief after voters rejected proposition 112, which would have required oil and gas wells to be located at least half a mile away from homes and other occupied buildings, the denver business journal reports. Voting rights for felons. More than 60 % of florida voters voted in favor of a measure to restore voting rights to more than a million felons who have completed their sentences, reports cnn. The measure excludes murderers and sex offenders. Photo id for voters. North carolina and arkansas voted to join 17 other states in requiring voters to show photo id. Redistricting. Colorado and michigan voted to reform redistricting by having it carried out by independent commissions instead of state legislatures. More marijuana.

Missouri also voted to legalize medical marijuana tuesday. Abortion. Alabama voters passed an amendment to the state constitution recognizing \" the rights of unborn children, including the right to life, \" while west virginia said yes to a measure banning medicaid from funding abortions, the los angeles times reports.

One new survey from the parent of dating sites like tinder finds that 69 % of 2,000 online daters surveyed rank financial stability as very or extremely important, putting it slightly ahead of humor ( 67 % ) and well ahead of attractiveness ( 51 % ), ambition ( 50 % ), courage ( 42 % ), and modesty ( 39 % ), per a press release. \" if you've got a pretty good credit score, you probably have other good personality traits, \" says helen fisher, a researcher at the kinsey institute and match.com's chief scientific advisor. That single number can speak to how responsible and dependable a person is. Fisher goes so far as to call it an \" honest indicator of who you really are \" that is a \" darwinian mechanism for measuring your reproductive ability. \" sure enough, another study finds that people with better credit are better at maintaining relationships, and that the further apart a couple's credit scores are, the greater their chances of separating.

The daily beast, which cites its own forensic analysis in its report, says the hackers employed a long-running password ruse around august 2017, in which various senatorial targets were sent emails claiming their microsoft exchange password had expired. Changing it required clicking on a link that brought users to a page that mirrored that of the us senate's active directory federation services. Microsoft was able to seize control of the site adfs.senate.qov.info and said that its review of the metadata indicated three lawmakers who are up for re-election in november were targeted. The company didn't name names, but the beast reports it viewed data that indicated a mccaskill policy aide had been targeted. Mccaskill addressed the attempt in general terms, saying in a statement that \" while this attack was not successful, it is outrageous that they think they can get away with this.... I've said it before and i will say it again, putin is a thug and a bully. \" mccaskill has spoken out against putin on many occasions; she's also considered a highly vulnerable senate democrat, as donald trump won her state with a nearly 20-point margin.

In 2016, president donald trump defeated hillary clinton by almost 20 points in the senator's home state of missouri. There's no evidence to suggest that this attempt to lure mccaskill staffers was successful. The precise purpose of the approach was also unclear.

Mccaskill, who has been highly critical of russia over the years, is widely considered to be among the most vulnerable senate democrats facing re-election this year as republicans hope to hold their slim majority in the senate. In 2016, president donald trump defeated hillary clinton by almost 20 points in the senator's home state of missouri. There's no evidence to suggest that this attempt to lure mccaskill staffers was successful. The precise purpose of the approach was also unclear. Asked about the hack attempt by russia's gru intelligence agency, mccaskill told the daily beast on thursday that she wasn't yet prepared to discuss it. \"i ' m not going to speak of it right now, \" she said. \"i think we ' ll have something on it next week.

Threatening some areas with up to a foot of wet snow, the storm has knocked out power in new jersey, connecticut, maryland, and pennsylvania. Inland mid-atlantic communities have seen the most clogged driveways so far, with 4 inches of snow reported in west virginia and 9 inches expected in maryland, the ap reports. Even heavier snowfall is forecast for later today and tomorrow in parts of new hampshire, the litchfield hills in northwestern connecticut, and the massachusetts berkshires. New york city, pelted by cold rain and snow most of today, is bracing for up to 10 inches by tonight, the new york daily news reports.

Bandmate weston richmond endured a broken arm and minor cuts, reports the los angeles times, while blake abbey of the band musical charis was stabbed in the arm and needed surgery, per the sacramento bee.

On monday, the adult film actress, who told anderson cooper she was threatened after she first went public about her alleged affair with president trump, filed a legal complaint against michael cohen, trump's personal lawyer. Her complaint says a statement cohen made in january — \" just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it can't cause you harm or damage \" — was meant to make people think she is an untrustworthy liar. The complaint says the statement is defamation that has exposed her to \" hatred, contempt, ridicule, and shame, \" politico reports. Cohen made the remark in february when discussing a $ 130,000 payment he said he had made to daniels out of his own funds before the 2016 election cohen, who denies trump had an affair with daniels in 2006, says he has the right to claim $ 20 million from her for violating a nondisclosure agreement. Sources tell the ap that trump, who has publicly remained silent on daniels, boasted to guests at mar-a-lago over the weekend that she owes another $ 1 million every time she talks and the interview makes the total $ 21 million. Friends of trump tell the washington post that the president is \" not in a punch-back mode \" because he has little to gain from firing back, though they say the allegations have put strain on his marriage.

Spacey — who has \" never played a [ video ] game in my life, \" he tells the new york times — plays villain jonathan irons in the activision game out tomorrow, a job that required him to wear performance capture technology that recorded his voice and body movements. It's the same process that allowed andy serkis to play gollum in the lord of the rings movies, but in this case spacey's likeness is also being preserved. \" it's really odd, \" spacey says of the motion capture experience. \" no makeup, no hair, nothing. They put dots on your face. Then you get into a kind of jumpsuit, which is exceedingly unattractive. A bunch of rubber-dot things all over that. They make you go into a room, and you have to do all kinds of physical things, \" all while surrounded by tiny cameras. Actors have long provided voices for video games, but often the physical actions of the character were captured using someone else. That's starting to change, and the times calls spacey's role one of the \" most sophisticated examples \" of the new process yet. Other actors who've played similar roles include ellen page and willem dafoe in beyond: two souls, jack black in brutal legend and peter jackson's king kong, and sigourney weaver in alien: isolation. As for why spacey did it, he tells the guardian that activision wanted \" to advance gaming. They wanted to begin to try to focus on really creating a character and storytelling that you would follow. \" plus, he adds, \" people thought i was crazy when i decided to move to london 11 years ago to start a new theater company at the old vic, when i could have stayed over here and made movie after movie after movie. Or when i decided to do a drama series with an online streaming company that had never done original content before.

Five of the seven people arrested in february were spanish citizens, the new york times reports, while the new york daily news says the other two detained were a moroccan and a syrian. An interior ministry spokesman says the clothes themselves were not made in spain; a company owned by one of the suspect reportedly imported used clothing. The uniforms, which weighed nearly five tons, were \" perfectly prepared for combat, \" per npr, which notes that officials did not say precisely where the uniforms had been bound for next. Investigators are still trying to figure out where the uniforms originated from.",

Abd al rahim al-nashiri was arraigned six years ago on charges he spearheaded the bombing of the uss cole off the coast of yemen in 2000 that killed 17 us sailors, the new york times reports. Nashiri was to be the first guantanamo prisoner to face the death penalty in court under a hybrid civilian-military trial system set up in the wake of sept. 11, but his trial has been delayed over ongoing problems, including now the defection of his legal team. The three civilian lawyers defending nashiri quit friday over claims — the details of which are classified — that the government was monitoring its legal meetings, creating an ethical conflict. \" we are angry about being placed in an ethically untenable position, disappointed in not being able to see the case through, and devastated to leave mr. Nashiri, whom we genuinely like and who deserves a real chance for justice, \" attorney rick kammen says. Kammen, as the only attorney with death penalty experience, is the important loss. The trial legally cannot move forward without a defense attorney well-versed in capital punishment. \"i've never tried a murder case and i am certainly not qualified as learned counsel, \" lt. Alaric piette, the only person left on nashiri's legal team, tells the herald. He says without someone to replace kammen, the \" court doesn't even have the veneer of fairness. \" brig. Gen. John baker says it's unclear how long it could take to find a replacement. Pretrial hearings were scheduled to start oct. 30.",

        "summary": "Woody allen's star-studded cafe society is the opening flick wednesday at the cannes film festival, and in a probably-not-coincidentally-timed piece in the hollywood reporter, his son with mia farrow, ronan farrow, pens a scathing essay on the \" culture of acquiescence \" surrounding his famous filmmaker dad, specifically regarding allen's alleged sexual abuse of dylan farrow, allen's adopted daughter and farrow's sister. Farrow notes the link that the media has made between his family's own situation and that of disgraced comedian bill cosby, looking at it all from both his personal perspective and that of a journalist — he's written for publications like the wall street journal and the la times and previously hosted his own msnbc news show — and he comes down on the \" self-perpetuating spin machine \" he says protects men like allen and cosby from being fully exposed. He notes that big stars ' pr reps, who get in tight with the media, as well as lack of a criminal conviction in cases like his dad's, \" [ make ] allen, cosby and other powerful men so difficult to cover... [ but no conviction ] is not an excuse for the press to silence victims, to never interrogate allegations. Indeed, it makes our role more important when the legal system so often fails the vulnerable as they face off against the powerful. \" the new york times posted dylan's take online in 2014, but it \" gave her alleged attacker twice the space \" in print to respond, farrow adds. He admits his shame for initially begging her himself to not speak up, and he takes the reporter to task for a may interview with allen with only a \" parenthetical mention \" of dylan's accusations. He also doubts media at cannes will ask \" tough questions \" of allen and his film's stars. \" that kind of silence isn't just wrong. It's dangerous, \" he says. \" it sends a message to victims that it's not worth the anguish of coming forward...

Nathan deal called tuesday's storm, which left commuters stranded on gridlocked highways and forced students to spend the night at schools, \" unexpected, \" saying forecasts had predicted the worst conditions would be south of the city. But a cnn meteorologist disputes that idea and says atlanta was warned; he himself predicted up to 2 inches of snow, and 2.3 inches fell. Numerous reports indicate the city had been warned of the coming weather by monday, and other southern states took more precautions. Even al roker has taken atlanta to task over the \" gamble \" it took. And deal admitted he didn't want to be \" accused of crying wolf \" and wasting millions of dollars, the ap reports. Once the snow started falling, according to atlanta mayor kasim reed, part of the problem was that businesses and schools released workers and students at the same time, leading to the gridlocked roads. \" if i had my druthers, we would have staggered the closures, \" he says. Former lt. Gen. Russel honore has a better idea: schools and government offices should never have been open at all on tuesday. ( both the governor and the mayor were at an award luncheon when the snow started to fall, and a state of emergency was not declared until after 5pm tuesday. ) and, funny as it may seem to northerners, a few inches of snow really is a big deal in the south. Atlanta doesn't have the capability to salt all its streets before a storm, like northern cities do, explains the cnn meteorologist: \" why would you buy 500 snowplows and salt trucks and have them sit around for 1,000 days, waiting for the next event? \" it also didn't help that once the gridlock began, salt trucks couldn't even get around. And some atlantans are complaining that a larger mass transit system and more roads are necessary. Meanwhile, how are things looking now? the atlanta journal-constitution reports that temperatures are still extremely low but will rise above freezing this afternoon, and there are still problems with black ice in some areas — so, though some parts of the interstates are safe, others aren't, and neighborhood streets are still in bad shape.

Prosecutors say that while parker did give \" some limited assistance \" to victims, he \" equally \" used the chaos following the attack to rob them. Parker's attorney says his client apologizes \" for his appalling behavior. \" parker was hailed as a hero following the attack — he says he was begging outside the venue when the bomb went off — and a gofundme created for him raised more than $ 70,000 from thousands of donors. The guardian reports none of that money has yet gone to parker, and a gofundme spokesperson says it \" will be refunded. \" parker was arrested tuesday after failing to appear in court. He has reportedly received death threats following his arrest. He has previous convictions for burglary and shoplifting.",

The strange case involves little ahmed mansour qorany sharara, reports cnn. A military court this month found him and 115 others guilty of killing three people and damaging state property during a protest in support of ousted president mohamed morsi in 2014. Ahmed would have been 16 months old at the time. After the verdict and the ensuing uproar over ahmed's fate, the military admitted a case of mistaken identity, reports the bbc. But it adds that ahmed's fate is unclear, and his parents are worried because police have been inquiring about his whereabouts. Reports differ, but authorities apparently included the child's name in the case in error, confusing him either with his uncle or a teenager. When police first showed up to arrest him and saw how young he was, they detained his father instead for four months. His dad went on egyptian tv this week to plead for his son not to be taken from him, reports egyptian streets. A military official promised that won't happen, but critics of egypt's justice system say it's so inept that anything could happen. For example, a defense attorney in the mass trial tried to clear things up by presenting the child's birth certificate, but \" it appeared that the court did not transfer the material, \" reports the jerusalem post.

The remains of middle-aged adults, young adults, and juveniles were found in various states, with some charred and deformed, perhaps indicating that a fire in the small house caused roof beams to fall on them. But how did bodies get there in the first place? perhaps it was a \" prehistoric disaster \" like an epidemic, say jilin university anthropologists who analyzed the bodies. \" ancient humans put remains into the house successively and stacked [ them ] centrally, \" according to a summary of their work at the american association of physical anthropologists. Plus the victims ' ages are close to those of bodies from an ancient mass burial in the miaozigou region, prompting speculation that an epidemic wiped out populations and left survivors little time to conduct proper burials. \" on the floor, numerous human skeletons are disorderly scattered, \" reads another report on the hamin mangha discovery, in chinese archaeology. \" the skeletons in the northwest are relatively complete, while those in the east often [ have ] only skulls, with limb bones scarcely remaining. But in the south, limb bones were discovered in a mess, forming two or three layers. \" the report adds that hamin mangha is \" the largest and best-preserved prehistoric settlement site found to date in northeast china. \" ( see why a 4,000-year-old home found in ohio is \" very significant. \" )",

When obama first started using teleprompters during his campaign, they made him seem more presidential. Now, they just open him up to ridicule. \"obama ruined the teleprompter for the rest of the politicians, \" says one media strategist. \"it's a negative because it's a sign of inauthenticity. It's a sign that you can't speak on your own two feet.

        "summary": "Dallas sniper micah johnson had plans for even greater mayhem than the murder of five police officers, dallas police chief david brown revealed in a cnn interview sunday. The chief says bomb-making materials and a journal found at the 25-year-old's home signal that he had plans for an attack \" large enough to have devastating effects throughout our city and our north texas area. \" johnson's journal is rambling and \" delusional, \" brown says, but police are \" convinced that this suspect had other plans, and thought what he was doing was righteous. \" brown says that long before last week's fatal police shootings of black men in louisiana and minnesota, johnson had been plotting to punish police for what he saw as \" law enforcement's efforts to punish people of color. \" in the same interview, the chief discussed the standoff, a message scrawled in blood, and the decision to use a robot to kill johnson. In other developments: the white house says president obama will visit dallas on tuesday, but critics want to know why he isn't also visiting baton rouge, la., and st. Paul, minn., after the police shootings there, the washington post reports. A police source tells the dallas morning news that johnson's journal isn't a coherent manifesto, but a rambling collection of writings that mix his thoughts on guns and violence with many other topics. \" this guy might have been a loner, \" the source says. \" but he was smart. \" the guardian reports that dallas mayor mike rawlings says armed marchers on thursday made it harder for police to deal with the real gunman. \" that is one of the real issues with the gun rights issues that we face — that in the middle of a firefight, it's hard to pick out the good guys and the bad guys, \" the mayor told cbs on sunday. Experts tell cnn that johnson's internet history suggests he may have been radicalized online by black nationalist groups using tactics earlier employed by groups such as white supremacists and radical islamists. A friend says johnson was obsessed with african-american history and would watch video of the beating of rodney king over and over again. The friend describes johnson as a \" good black man with a little bit of an anger problem. \" dozens more protesters were arrested in baton rouge on sunday when riot police clashed with a group that broke away from a peaceful protest, the new orleans times-picayune reports.

So says a new study by british and finnish scientists who found that plastic checkpoint trays harbor more viruses than any other helsinki airport surface, including toilet surfaces, reports the new york times. The top virus found was rhinovirus, which gives people the common cold, followed by the influenza a virus. Traces cropped up on half the security trays and also appeared at store payment terminals, stair rails, passport-check counters, and areas where children play, per a release. \" the presence of microbes in the environment of an airport has not been investigated previously, \" says a virology expert involved in the study. The upshot: help prevent infections by washing your hands with soap and warm water and coughing into a handkerchief, sleeve, or tissue, says study co-author jonathan van-tam. \" these simple precautions can help prevent pandemics and are most important in crowded areas like airports that have a high volume of people traveling to and from many different parts of the world, \" he adds. A vanderbilt university professor agrees it's easy to get germs from luggage trays, where people place items they've breathed on, but tells cbs news that the flu and cold are mostly disseminated via the air. The study is part of a bigger european project about how airports and other traffic centers spread infections. ( meanwhile, stds just set a new us record. )",

        "summary": "\" it's one of the great days for wildlife conservation in the history of north america, \" says a conservationist following what parks canada officials are calling a \" historic homecoming \" in alberta's banff national park. Sixteen bison, including 10 pregnant cows, were moved 275 miles from elk island national park near edmonton to a remote valley of banff national park last week, reports the cbc. For 16 months, they ' ll remain under supervision in an enclosed pasture, but the goal is to have them roam free in a 460-square-mile area of the park beginning in summer 2018. Bison were last kept at the park in 1997, but a wild herd hasn't roamed in what is canada's oldest national park for more than 130 years, per the globe and mail. Though ranchers are concerned that the animals could damage property or spread disease — the bison introduced to the landscape were screened for things like bovine tuberculosis — conservationist harvey locke expects few challenges. \" we know from the archaeological record that bison were in this park for over 10,000 years \" so \" it's a native species in its native habitat, \" he says. He adds the $ 6.4 million project involves \" the righting of wrong \" after hunters nearly eradicated wild bison, which once numbered in the tens of millions throughout the continent, in the 19th century. Banff's herd will ultimately become \" one of only four plains bison herds in north america that would be fully interacting with their predators and shaping the ecosystem, \" a project manager tells reuters.

Melia robinson wanted to see how one of these dieting regimens would affect her, and she concludes for business insider that it \" vastly improved my life. \" the course she followed: the ketogenic, or keto, diet, which deprives the body of carbohydrates — just 50 grams a day instead of the recommended 225 to 325 grams daily — and sends it into \" starvation mode. \" what it then burns instead: a person's fat stores, which are broken down into organic byproducts called ketones, which then become the body's main fuel supply. To keep the fat stores well stocked, that means individuals on this diet have to scarf down plenty of cheese, eggs, and avocados. Off the menu: pasta, bread, rice, and other carb-heavy foods, including some fruits. And so, under the direction of a doctor, robinson followed a routine she calls \" atkins on steroids. \" that meant breakfasts of butter-fried eggs and greasy bacon, as well as lunches consisting of \" sad desk salads. \" robinson sated hunger pangs in between with \" fat bomb \" snacks ( her favorite: cauliflower smothered in butter, sour cream, and cheese ). After just two weeks, she says her body \" flipped the switch \" and started using up her body fat to replace the carbs it had previously burned. Then her energy spiked, she no longer needed coffee as an afternoon pick-me-up, and her obsession with snacking waned. One month in, robinson reached a \" state of ketosis, \" with few remaining side effects. She not only lost 8 pounds over two months, but she experienced better concentration and more energy. \" it made me feel like a superhero, \" she writes. More on robinson's eating experiment here.",

        "summary": "Everybody lies at some point, but scientists say they've uncovered a biological mechanism supporting the \" slippery slope \" that leads some from smaller acts of dishonesty to larger transgressions. Reporting in the journal nature neuroscience, they write that mri scans allowed them to watch how a particular part of the brain — the amygdala, where emotions are processed — changed when lies were told. The upshot? \" the brain adapts to dishonesty. \" study author tali sharot tells the new york times that it's similar to how one adapts to the smell of perfume: \" you buy a new perfume, and it smells strongly. A few days later, it smells less. And a month later, you don't smell it at all. \" to test this, researchers presented 55 participants with pictures of jars full of pennies and asked them to tell a partner how much money was contained in the jar. Over dozens of short experiments, the participants were incentivized to lie to varying degrees for varying outcomes. Generally, the amygdala showed the most change when the first lie was told, but the change decreased as the lies grew. Essentially, people became desensitized to lying, some more than others. Someone who'd repeatedly lie for a few pennies was more likely to lie for more money later, reports npr. Sharot says follow-up work should examine whether this kind of adaptation escalates other behaviors, such as violence. ( see where the us ranks when it comes to deception. )",

The gop's presumptive nominee becomes a septuagenarian tuesday, and he ' ll be 70 years, seven months on jan. 20, 2017, the daily beast notes. That would put him ahead of the country's previous oldest commander in chief, ronald reagan, who was just a few days shy of his 70th birthday when he took the helm. Clinton, on the other hand, would be the second-oldest president: she'd be close to 69 years and three months on inauguration day. Yet even though together the two candidates are the oldest pair ever to compete against each other for the highest office, no one's really talking too much about that aspect, the daily beast notes, contrasting this run with reagan's in 1980, when his age \" was a very big deal. \" why age may just be a number this time around: a statistically older demographic, other older candidates such as bernie sanders basking in the limelight, and a \" mutual assured destruction \" that keeps clinton and trump from attacking each other on this point. \" it's highly unlikely that we will see either clinton or trump start their mornings with a brisk three-mile run, \" the daily beast notes.

But a new study suggests that women who lose their significant other to another by way of infidelity \" actually win in the long run \" because the experience bestows \" higher mating intelligence, \" according to a press release. A relationship expert tells the telegraph that the binghamton university study is confirmation of what people who have been through a breakup already know. \" it can feel brutally painful, but also offers valuable life experience that truly does help us make better decisions in the future, \" she says. Summarizing the flipside of the breakup equation, mic notes that the \" other woman \" has just gotten involved with someone who cheats. \" thus, \" says study author craig morris, \" in the long-term, she loses. \" for the study — called the largest-ever dealing with breakups — researchers conducted anonymous online surveys of 5,705 people in 96 countries. The results show that the consequences of competition for mates among women \" may be both evolutionarily adaptive and also beneficial in terms of personal growth, \" and may move \" beyond mating and into other realms of personal development. \" or, as the post at mic sums up: \" maybe that's why so many crappy breakups, whether they involve cheating or not, can make us feel like entirely new people once we've gotten over them. \" next, the researchers plan to look at breakup dynamics through the lenses of life experience, age, and relationship history.

Dona st. Plite, 1993: the haitian-born reporter and commentator for miami's wkat was murdered while at a benefit honoring a colleague who had been killed. The killing was rumored to be political in nature. James edwin richards, 2000: the editor of the crime-focused neighborhood news email newsletter was shot dead in venice, calif.; his work had reportedly given birth to a number of enemies. William biggart, 2001: the freelance photojournalist's body was found in the ground zero rubble four days after the 9/11 attack. Kent heitholt, 2001: the columbia ( missouri ) daily tribune sports editor was murdered as he was heading home for the night. A man who was wrongfully convicted of the crime spent nearly a decade in prison; the case remains unsolved. Robert stevens, 2001: the sun photo editor died after breathing in anthrax at work in florida; he was the first person killed in the mailed anthrax attacks of that year. Chauncey bailey, 2007: the editor-in-chief of the oakland post was shot and killed as he walked to work. Three men with connections to a local bakery that had received unfavorable coverage ultimately went to prison for the crime. Charnice milton, 2015: the dc reporter, a contributor to capital community news publications, had just finished an assignment and was walking to a bus stop on her way home when she was hit by a bullet intended for someone else.

Cruz and co-sponsor mike lee say the white house has gone too far in extending federal benefits to gay couples — like so — since the supreme court gutted the defense of marriage act in june, reports the daily caller. If a state chooses to recognize same-sex marriages, that's one thing, says cruz. But if a state chooses not to do so, the feds should butt out. The bill would \" ensure the federal government gives the same deference to the 33 states that define marriage as the union between one man and one woman as it does to the 17 states that have chosen to recognize same-sex unions, \" says cruz. A similar bill has been introduced in the house. Luke johnson at the huffington post writes that while cruz's bill has no chance of being considered in the senate, \" it is a sign that gay marriage is still an issue among the conservative right. \"",

Per the guardian and cnn, k-pop group bts was scheduled to be on tv asahi's music station program friday night, in advance of the band's upcoming japanese tour, but a pic emerged that seemed to show one of the bandmates, 23-year-old jimin, sporting a long-sleeved tee with the words \" patriotism ourhistory [ sic ] liberation korea \" repeated several times, as well as an image of a mushroom cloud over one of the japanese cities hit by an atomic bomb during wwii ( the guardian says it's a pic of hiroshima; cnn says nagasaki ).

The large canvas, which measures 56 inches by 69 inches, has already been dated to between 1600 and 1610, reports the guardian. A leading expert tells afp that the painting depicting biblical heroine judith beheading an assyrian general is a \" true original \" that is \" almost certainly identifiable, even if we do not have any tangible or irrefutable proof. \" the so-called \" lost caravaggio \" likely went missing a century after it was painted, while another version of it rediscovered in 1950 hangs at the national gallery of ancient art in rome, reports the bbc. Caravaggio, born in 1571, is known for having led a violent and chaotic life ( he was jailed often and is said to have killed a man ) and died mysteriously at just 38 years of age. But he also pioneered the baroque painting technique known as chiaroscuro, which features light and shadow in sharp contrast. The expert the family turned the dusty painting over to upon finding it in april 2014 has consulted with many others, including at the louvre in paris and in caravaggio's native italy, and concludes that a \" copier or a less talented artist \" wouldn't have been able to paint so masterfully, reports the los angeles times. Meanwhile, france has banned the export of the painting for 30 months to allow for a full investigation. ( another hundred early caravaggio works were found just a few years ago. )",

They accuse black, mother of austin stephanos, of violating florida's child neglect and abuse laws. The state, however, is not pressing charges, because boating on the open sea is not considered an \" inherently dangerous activity, \" and thus it would be too difficult to get a conviction. Investigators say black allowed her son and his friend perry cohen to take a \" minimally-equipped \" 19-foot 1978 seacraft without basic safety devices onto open water, even though she knew that perry's parents had forbidden him to do so without an adult present. The report also says black waited more than two hours after she could not reach her son to notify perry's parents that the two were missing and didn't even notify law enforcement or emergency personnel. Perry's stepfather did that immediately after they got the call from black. Those hours are deemed critical in the search for the boys.

While fdle investigators said they believe their investigation showed probable cause to charge at least one of the parents, the state attorney said there was not enough proof \"to satisfy the statutory language \" of florida's child neglect statute. Fdle said \"the egregious lapse in judgment and failure to exercise due care had the effect of culminating in the disappearance of both boys who are now believed to have perished. \" related: more coverage of the missing teens case assistant state attorney greg kridos said while \"there may have been poor judgment, \" boating on the open seas was not an \"inherently dangerous activity, \" as fdle had concluded. Nicholas korniloff, perry cohen's stepfather, said friday he had no comment. William blu stephanos, austin's father, said in a statement the family was thankful for all the efforts of the agencies and volunteers involved with the search and investigation but would not comment on the outcome of the report. On july 24, 2015, austin stephanos and perry cohen left the jib yacht club marina in tequesta and headed through the jupiter inlet to the ocean. Austin"

Scientists already knew that the drug killed brain cells, but \" autopsies \" on the dead brain cells of mice given ' 70s-rock-star levels of cocaine revealed that the cells had been killed when autophagy — the process by which cells absorb unwanted debris — went completely out of control and the cells began devouring vital parts of themselves, the guardian reports. The same effect was seen in the babies of mice given large amounts of cocaine while pregnant. \" a cell is like a household that is constantly generating trash, \" the paper's lead author, neuroscientist prasun guha, explains in a press release. \" autophagy is the housekeeper that takes out the trash — it's usually a good thing. But cocaine makes the housekeeper throw away really important things, like mitochondria, which produce energy for the cell. \" itv reports that the researchers found a possible antidote, an experimental drug called cgp3466b that's been tested to treat diseases like parkinson's, though they say that there will have to be a lot more research on humans before it could be considered for use reducing the damage from cocaine use.

        "summary": "Americans know the nina, the pinta, and the santa maria; in australia, the endeavour is the ship that's burned into memory. It set sail from plymouth, england, in 1768 with captain james cook at the helm and was in 1770 the first european ship to chart parts of australia during cook's round-the-world voyage. Now, what the sydney morning herald calls \" one of the greatest maritime mysteries of all time \" may have been solved: the ship's final resting place. It's long been known that the endeavour came to rest off the coast of rhode island; the new york times reports the ship was used by the british during the revolutionary war and then sunk as a means of thwarting french ships coming to assist the americans. For the last 25 years, it has been believed to be one of 13 wrecks, and in 2016, that group was narrowed to five. Now, \" we can say we think we know which one it is, \" says the head of the rhode island marine archaeology project. Rimap on friday released the results of its study, which reportedly centers around a site off goat island in narragansett bay in newport. But the guardian sounds a note of caution, quoting the director of the australian national maritime museum as saying a confirmation has not yet happened, and that divers are retrieving timber samples that will hopefully provide verification that the ship is british in origin. The morning herald notes the ship was constructed from oak and pine, and it's not clear how much of it has survived after two centuries underwater.",

Once the virus reaches the us, it will become a permanent, low-level threat, like the west nile virus, according to researchers at this week's annual meeting of the global virus network in atlanta, per national geographic. The post suggests that a zika shot will become as routine as the current vaccine for rubella. Anthony fauci of the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases tells nbc news that small, local outbreaks are \" very likely \" in the us by summer and thus pressure to develop a vaccine is growing. A small vaccine trial is expected to begin next fall, with a working vaccine possible by early 2018 at best, reports mit technology review. Congress has yet to approve $ 1.9 billion in emergency funding for zika work, and the funds are \" absolutely essential, \" says fauci. As to why: \" the number of travelers coming into the us with zika is very high, the temperatures are permissive now for mosquito transmission, and populations of mosquitos are growing, \" says a university of texas virologist. \" it only takes one infected person to arrive and be bitten and the transmission cycle takes off. \" he predicts the first vaccines will require multiple doses and will be given to women and girls reaching childbearing age to prevent birth defects. Antiviral drugs could be used in the meantime. \" we have no information to believe there are any long-term consequences from infection to healthy adults or healthy children, \" he says.",

The schools, and even the hospitals, were still separate - for white folks, for black folks, no intermingling. The churches, too. Enter the rev. Vernon tyson ( rick schroder ), a white methodist pastor with a wife ( susan walters ) and four kids in tow, who settles into his new parish - and proceeds to unsettle the town with his talk of integration and equality. When a black veteran returns home and is killed - multiple shotgun wounds and a savage beating, allegedly at the hands of a trio of white oxfordians - the proverbial dam bursts. There is looting, there is rioting in the streets. A trial, by an all-white jury, presided over by a white judge, ends with the men charged with murder",

            "Nate parker ( center ) as benjamin chavis, the activist who as a teacher was radicalized by the 1970 killing of a black veteran. Based on a true story - and a brutal one, like so many to emerge from the jim crow south - jeb stuart's blood done sign my name is set in oxford, n.c., a seemingly sleepy burg where, as late as 1970, desegregation hadn't happened: blacks couldn't get haircuts in white-owned barbershops, or get jobs that weren't along the lines of janitor or maid. The schools, and even the hospitals, were still separate - for white folks, for black folks, no intermingling. The churches, too. Enter the rev. Vernon tyson ( rick schroder ), a white methodist pastor with a wife ( susan walters ) and four kids in tow, who settles into his new parish - and proceeds to unsettle the town with his talk of integration and equality. When a black veteran returns home and is killed - multiple shotgun wounds and a savage beating, allegedly at the hands of a trio of white oxfordians - the proverbial dam bursts. There is looting, there is rioting in the streets. A trial, by an all-white jury, presided over by a white judge, ends with the men charged with murder",

The fbi, however, now says the incident is being investigated as a \" potential assault \" and that other scenarios are possible, the ap reports. Culberson county sheriff oscar carrillo says that in rugged terrain on a moonless night, it's possible that both men were injured after falling into the 9-foot-deep culvert where they were found, reports the dallas morning news. He says the injuries to martinez were \" very consistent with a fall, \" though it's not clear how his partner was also injured after radioing for help. The partner is still hospitalized with serious injuries, and a law enforcement source tells the ap that he has no memory of what happened. Chris cabrera, a spokesman for the union that represents border patrol officers, says it is \" insulting \" to suggest the men were not attacked, the los angeles times reports. \" there's no way he fell, \" cabrera says of martinez. \" border patrol agents are like mountain goats. They don't fall. Especially two at the same spot. \" at a tuesday briefing in el paso, fbi special agent in charge emmerson buie jr. Stressed that the agency is \" aggressively investigating all leads. \" president trump, who says the agents were \" brutally beaten, \" repeated his call for a border wall after the incident.",

The baby bison was born at the nachusa grasslands prairie restoration preserve just 95 miles west of chicago, reports the chicago tribune. The calf was born to one of around 30 bison moved to the preserve from iowa last fall, surprising workers who hadn't expected any of the bison in the only wild buffalo herd east of the mississippi to give birth until may at the earliest. The last recorded killing of a wild buffalo east of the river was in 1830 in indiana, according to the usda. \" from a historical standpoint, this hasn't happened in illinois in about 200 years, \" an ecologist for the project tells the tribune, adding that the calf \" looked great. \" the introduction of the bison — whose grazing allows many native plant and insect species to flourish — is one of the final steps of the project to restore some 3,500 acres to the native prairie that used to cover more than half the state, al jazeera reports. Last week, officials announced that they plan to bring another herd of bison to a prairie restoration project on the site of an old military ammunition plant just 45 miles south of chicago, reports the ap.

One thing that struck me immediately about the two companies -- an impression that has been reinforced almost daily -- is that amazon does everything wrong, and google does everything right. Sure, it's a sweeping generalization, but a surprisingly accurate one. It's pretty crazy. There are probably a hundred or even two hundred different ways you can compare the two companies, and google is superior in all but three of them, if i recall correctly. I actually did a spreadsheet at one point but legal wouldn't let me show it to anyone, even though recruitingit.i mean, just to give you a very brief taste: amazon's recruiting process is fundamentally flawed by having teams hire for themselves, so their hiring bar is incredibly inconsistent across teams, despite various efforts they've made to level it out. And their operations are a mess; they don't really have sres and they make engineers pretty much do everything, which leaves almost no time for coding - though again this varies by group, so it's luck of the draw.

Two irula tribesmen from india are working with the us fish and wildlife service to catch burmese pythons in areas including the crocodile lake national wildlife refuge on key largo, the palm beach post reports. The irula are renowned in india for their snake-catching skills, wesh reports, and in their first eight days on the florida hunt, they managed to catch 13 pythons — an enormous haul, compared to the total of 68 caught by 1,600 hunters over the first month-long python challenge in 2013. Last year, the state-sanctioned hunt caught 106 pythons. In key largo, the snakes were recently spotted for the first time and officials fear they will make their way through the islands, devastating native species in they same way that they squeezed much of the life out of the everglades. \" there's just a thin stretch of road between us and the mainland, so of course the snakes were going to slither their way here, \" elizabeth moscynski, president of the key largo chamber of commerce, tells the washington post. \" we've got a lot of endangered species down here, so it's just like a smorgasbord for those snakes. \" state officials hope the tribesmen, who will be in florida until february, will teach some of their \" incredible \" skills to people in the state during the $ 68,888 effort.

But he paid an enormous price: he had severe dairy allergies, and died after apparently being served oatmeal containing dairy. The guards allegedly accused saffioti of \" faking \" his distress, the huffington post reports. Though saffioti died on july 3, 2012, his story is making headlines now because his mother is suing the county, alleging the jail knew about his medical needs and served him unsafe food anyway. This week, kiro tv got footage from the jail that appears to show saffioti talking to the guards, servers, and even fellow inmates about his breakfast — video his mother's lawyer had to fight to obtain; she says the county initially insisted it didn't exist. After being \" assured the oatmeal in the food was safe for eating, \" the lawyer says, saffioti took a few bites. Just a few minutes later, he started using his inhaler and returned to the guard desk. But instead of being sent to the nurse, as he requested, saffioti was returned to his cell, the lawsuit claims. More video shows him jumping up and down as other inmates look in; the lawsuit claims he also pressed his call button, but received no response. Thirty-five minutes after he started eating, saffioti was found unconscious in his cell by a guard; he was soon pronounced dead at a hospital. And because saffioti had been at the jail before, \" they absolutely knew about michael's medical needs \" and even had a medical file on him, the lawyer says, adding that the module received no special diet trays on the day of saffioti's death.

The video comes from jail module e-4 on the morning of july 3, 2012. Around 5: 46, a group of inmates arrived to serve breakfast and men began lining up. While others sat to eat, the camera first captured saffioti at the guard's desk, holding his tray. Saffioti suffered from extreme dairy allergies and took regular pains to protect himself.

            "Today's story is part drug war, part police indifference and callousness, part police cover-up. It comes by way of a lawsuit filed by the family of michael saffioti. Saffioti failed to make a court date on a misdemeanor charge for pot possession. In july of last year, he surrendered himself to snohomish county, washington authorities, who promptly jailed him. ( the streets of snohomish county were a little safer that day. ) when it came time for breakfast the following morning, saffioti is seen on video having a conversation with a guard while holding his tray. Presumably, he was inquiring about any dairy products in the meal. Saffioti had a severe allergy. He's then seen taking a few bites of some oatmeal. ( you can watch the video here. ) the awfulness that followed is detailed by kiro tv. Within a few minutes, saffioti was back at the guard desk, using his inhaler. According to the legal claim, he asked to see a nurse. Instead, he was sent to his cell. Over the next half hour, the video shows other inmates looking in saffioti's cell as he jumped up and down. The legal claim says he pressed his call button and was ignored. It also alleges that the guards told him h was \" faking. \" about",
            "By graham johnson video obtained by kiro 7 through a public records request shows a snohomish county jail inmate questioning the breakfast he was fed that ultimately killed him. Michael saffioti, 22, was no career criminal. He had turned himself in because of an outstanding misdemeanor warrant for marijuana possession. The video comes from jail module e-4 on the morning of july 3, 2012. Around 5: 46, a group of inmates arrived to serve breakfast and men began lining up. While others sat to eat, the camera first captured saffioti at the guard's desk, holding his tray. Saffioti suffered from extreme dairy allergies and took regular pains to protect himself. Because he had been at the snohomish county jail once before, guards had a medical file on him. \" our theory is that they absolutely knew about michael's medical needs, \" said cheryl snow, the attorney for saffioti's mother, rose. Snow has filed notice of a $ 10 million claim against the county, which says no special diet trays were sent to the module that morning. The video shows saffioti apparently discussing his food with the guard, servers and fellow inmates. Eventually, he took a few bites. \" we know that he asked questions and made inquiries and he was assured the oatmeal in the food was safe for"

        "summary": "A tiny, funny-looking creature that scampered around what is now china some 55 million years ago might help rewrite the book on primates, reports the bbc. Scientists have concluded that little archicebus achilles — it weighed about an ounce and was maybe 8 inches long — is the world's oldest primate skeleton. In fact, at 55 million years, it pushes back the date of the first such fossil by about 7 million years, reports popular science. It also bolsters the theory that primates got their start in asia, not africa, notes the new york times. The ancient creature is especially intriguing because it existed at the time of an evolutionary split in primates, with one branch going toward anthropoids ( monkeys, apes, and humans ) and the other toward tarsiers ( small, big-eyed, nocturnal animals ). \"any time you find a specimen like this, it's a bit special, \" says a co-author of the report in nature. \" it's adding a lot of depth of history. \" the fossil was found in what used to be a lake, back when china and much of earth was essentially a tropical jungle, one expert tells the bbc.",

        "summary": "In 1298, marco polo wrote a manuscript, now dubbed the travels of marco polo, describing his adventures along the silk road to china, his meeting with mongol ruler kublai khan, and the innovations he came across, like eyeglasses. In the centuries since, some historians have doubted whether the venetian actually traveled as far as he claimed, based in part on his failure to mention chopsticks, per history.com. But nearly 700 years after his death, polo is setting the record straight himself. A three-year study of polo's sheepskin will, written in latin by a priest-notary in 1324, offers more evidence of polo's adventures across asia, reports reuters. For instance, the will secured the freedom of polo's indentured servant, a man polo named peter, who was from the tatar clan of mongols. Researchers say this — and an inventory of possessions mentioning musk from the far east — suggests polo did in fact reach china, which is now the accepted narrative. Christopher columbus apparently believed it, having carefully perused his own copy of the travels of marco polo, which pointe-à-callière museum refers to as \" the most famous travel guide ever written. \" the study also helped correct errors in polo's will blamed on the notary's poor handwriting ( a word believed to refer to fabric actually meant a residence ) and highlighted the explorer's possible belief in gender equality: though possessions were usually left to male relatives at the time, polo gave almost everything to his wife and three daughters.

Following in the wake of harvey and irma late monday, hurricane jose was a category 1 storm near the southeast tip of the bahamas, centered about 400 miles north-northeast of turks and caicos, reports the sun sentinel. According to weather underground, the hurricane is expected to weaken over the next few days as it makes \" a slow clockwise loop \" in the atlantic, passing over cool water it previously churned up. Where the storm will go from there is difficult to predict, but some models suggest it will regain some strength as it moves west-northwest toward the us beginning thursday. That would put the storm on a path to hit the eastern bahamas on friday before continuing toward florida. The national hurricane center predicts it will be a category 1 hurricane with 90mph winds by saturday. It could technically reach the east coast of the us by next tuesday, but one model gives it only a 25 % chance of hitting the us, a 25 % chance of hitting canada, and a 50 % chance of heading out to sea, per quartz. Given the uncertainty of its path, a rep for the national hurricane center says \" right now there is no concern for any land \" so \" no one needs to be freaking out about jose, \" per the miami herald.

The memo charged that neither the initial fisa application nor any of its renewals made mention of the \" dnc, clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding \" the dossier, despite \" senior and fbi officials \" knowing of its \" political origins. \" but the washington post interviews two us officials who dispute that claim and say the doj did note \" the research was being paid for by a political entity, \" although the dnc and clinton weren't specifically named. Devin nunes, intel committee chair, addressed the discrepancy monday on fox &amp; friends, minimizing what he called a \" footnote. \" \" a footnote saying something may be political is a far cry from letting the american people know that the democrats and the hillary campaign paid for dirt that the fbi then used to get a warrant on an american citizen to spy on another campaign, \" he said, leading new york to riff: \" so now the main attack on the fbi is about font size. \" page himself appeared on laura ingraham's show monday, calling the memo \" worse than i could have possibly imagined, \" per politico, which noted page \" mostly continued his habit of dodging questions about his connections to russia \" during the interview.
