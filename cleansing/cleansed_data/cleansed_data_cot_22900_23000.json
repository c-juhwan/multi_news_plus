        "summary": "Catholic bishops who suspect clerical child abuse need not report it to police. That's apparently the opinion of the vatican, spelled out in a training document for newly appointed bishops. \" according to the state of civil laws of each country where reporting is obligatory, it is not necessarily the duty of the bishop to report suspects to authorities, the police, or state prosecutors in the moment when they are made aware of crimes or sinful deeds, \" the document written by a french monsignor states, per the guardian. Instead, it notes it's a bishop's duty to report the abuse internally, and let victims or their family members share the claims with police. The document appears to have been created with no help from the special commission pope francis formed to develop \" best practices \" to prevent and address clerical abuse, reports cruxnow.com. Indeed, a church official says the commission would likely take issue with the document since it views reporting abuse to civil authorities as a \" moral obligation, whether the civil law requires it or not. \" an advocate for victims of clerical sexual abuse calls the document \" unfathomable, \" per upi. \" it's infuriating, and dangerous that so many believe the myth that bishops are changing how they deal with abuse, \" a rep for the survivors network of those abused by priests adds.",

            "Given what a cancer the clerical sexual abuse scandals have been for the catholic church, one would imagine the vatican would want new bishops to get a state-of-the-art presentation on best practices in terms of preventing such meltdowns in the future. The vatican has been running just such a training course since 2001 for newly appointed bishops around the world, and almost 30 percent of the catholic prelates in the world today have taken it. It's more than a bit surprising, therefore, to discover that at least last year, the pontifical commission for the protection of minors, the body created by pope francis to identify \"best practices \" in the fight against child abuse, was not involved in the training. What's the point of creating a commission to promote best practices, and putting one of the church's most credible leaders on the abuse issue, boston cardinal sean p. O ' malley, in charge of it, and yet not having it address the new leaders who will have to implement those practices? on monday, the top official at the congregation for bishops, canadian cardinal marc ouellet, outlined the papers presented during the most recent course, saying he wanted to invite \"suggestions for improving the experience. \" traditionally, bishops have three key tasks: sanctifying, teaching, and governing. New bishops need to hear",

' and when they find out the other ip address on the other end is connected to aurora, colorado, outside denver, the connection to zazi, it takes them to the plot to blow up the new york subways, it's all prevented. That's how a program like this is supposed to work. \" but over at buzzfeed, ben smith questions whether it was really the nsa spying that thwarted the plot, arguing that british intel was already monitoring email accounts linked to zazi. \" this is the sort investigation made possible by ordinary warrants under the foreign intelligence surveillance act, \" he writes.",

When he made those comments during a press conference thursday, mulvaney was talking about cdbg, the community development block grants program. While some states do allocate cdbg money to meals on wheels, most of the nonprofit's funding comes from a different program in a completely different department, meals on wheels spokesperson jenny bertolette says. She says the amount of cdbg money that goes to meals on wheels varies widely from state to state. Now in fairness to those concerned about the future of meals on wheels, which feeds 2.4 million seniors every year, trump's proposed budget includes a 17.9 % cut to the health and human services department, where the majority of funding for meals on wheels does reside. The budget doesn't specify how that cut would impact the program's funding, but the assumption is it isn't good. That could be why, as cnn reports, donations to meals on wheels were 50 times their normal level on thursday and volunteer sign-ups were up 500 %. Bertolette calls the support \" amazing \" and \" very overwhelming. \" meanwhile, quartz notes that for the $ 16.5 million taxpayers are estimated to have paid for president trump's five trips to mar-a-lago this year, meals on wheels could feed nearly 6,000 seniors for a full year.",

The hackers hijacked up to a million cameras, dvrs, and other devices and used them to generate webpage requests and unwanted data that forced targets offline in a \" denial-of-service attack. \" it's not clear whether the hackers had access to any video feeds from the devices, but the attack has renewed concerns over the so-called \" internet of things, \" \" smart \" devices that connect to the internet and are present in millions of homes — and that are likely \" plugged in and forgotten, \" the journal notes. Such devices are likely \" never going to be updated \" by users, says a security expert, and they include not just cameras and video recorders but lightbulbs, routers, cable set-top boxes, refrigerators, and even cars. Krebs notes, \" we need to address this as a clear and present threat not just to censorship but to critical infrastructure. \" and another security expert says this attack could have been just \" the tip of the iceberg. \" the chinese manufacturer of hijacked security cameras used in the attack, dahua technology, recommends users always update their devices ' firmware and use strong passwords. As for why krebs was targeted, engadget says it was revenge for him having recently exposed two major sellers of tools used in cyberattacks.

Earlier this month, the astronomer at the university of hawaii institute for astronomy discovered a mysterious object zipping through our solar system. Calculations show it came within 24 million miles of the sun on sept. 9 and 15 million miles of earth on oct. 14 while traveling at a blinding 37 miles per second. Calculations also show something unprecedented: the object, currently classified as asteroid a/2017 u1, is the first confirmed to have arrived in our solar system from another. \" it is fairly certain we are dealing with our first truly identified alien visitor, \" professor alan fitzsimmons tells the guardian. Astronomers have calculated the orbit of a/2017 u1 into the past and future and found it always traveling fast enough to escape the sun's gravity. \" unless there are serious problems \" with astronomers ' calculations, that means it came from outside the solar system, according to the minor planet center. The center's dr. Gareth williams explains that the object's orbit features \" no close approaches to any of the giant planets that could have given this thing a kick, \" so \" it is coming from interstellar space and it is going to interstellar space. \" a/2017 u1, which is estimated to be less than 400 meters in diameter, appears to already be on its way back out of our solar system, so scientists are rushing to study it before it's too late. They say it could be made out of entirely different materials than those that comprise the comets and asteroids found closer to home. ( a 40-year-old signal from space has finally been explained. )",

But the real story is a bit more complicated, as zack o ' malley greenburg explains in forbes. A press release issued this week explains that jay z bought out sovereign brands'stake in the company. But the rapper has always had a financial interest in armand de brignac, greenburg writes. The backstory: jay z used to favor cristal, but in 2006, the manager of the company that makes that champagne was asked about cristal's popularity with rappers. His reply: \" what can we do? we can't forbid people from buying it. \" jay z called for a boycott of the champagne; later that year, a bottle of armand de brignac champagne, nicknamed \" ace of spades \" for its logo, appeared in the aforementioned music video, and still later that year, the champagne started being sold in north america. Greenburg went to a lot of trouble to figure out the true origin of armand de brignac champagne: it's made by cattier, a french company, and the gold bottle bears \" a striking resemblance \" to one of cattier's other brands, the $ 60-a-bottle antique gold, which was discontinued in 2006. Greenburg eventually learned that jay z owned what sources said was a $ 50 million stake in armand de brignac, sharing ownership with cattier and, until this week, sovereign brands. ( at a 2012 fundraiser jay z and beyonce hosted for president obama, there was an 18-foot tower of the bubbly — $ 280,000 worth. )",

The stalker, michael david barrett, was found 51 % responsible, while west end hotel partners, the owner of the nashville marriott where the 2008 filming took place, and windsor capital group, the management company, were deemed 49 % at fault for letting barrett book the room next to andrews, per the tennessean. But because barrett will likely not be able to pay much, if anything, toward the judgment, andrews ' attorneys are now saying the hotel owner and operator should have to fork over the entire $ 55 million. A new filing by andrews ' legal team asks a nashville judge to apply the \" joint and several liability \" rule, a law that says all parties jointly liable for an act are also independently liable for the full extent of damages, per wkrn — which means the hotel companies would be on the hook for andrews ' entire payout. What complicates things: tennessee overturned that law in 2013, but cases before july 1, 2013, are apparently grandfathered in. \" the intentional conduct of barrett was a foreseeable consequence of their negligence, \" andrews ' attorneys note in the filing. A nashville attorney not involved in the case agrees, telling the tennessean, \" the jury found that the hotel enabled a predator to cause harm to a hotel guest. Ms. Andrews is asking that the hotel be held accountable for the entire amount of harm caused. It's a very solid legal argument based on well-reasoned tennessee legal decisions. \" ( andrews has openly advocated for anti-stalking initiatives. )",

While the girls are clearly just playing around, edward — who became king a few years after the 1933 video and then abdicated to marry wallis simpson — had close ties to germany and was often accused of having nazi sympathies, the independent reports.

He belonged instinctively to a gullible ruling class that longed to bring ' order ' and ' control'to a tumultuous decade. \" but there has been no suggestion that the queen's parents had nazi leanings, reports the new york times, which notes that they were praised for staying in london instead of fleeing to canada during wartime bombing, with the queen mother saying, \" the children won't go without me.

Ravi kumar reportedly became so exhausted on his descent that he needed to lie down. Also ill, the climber's guide descended for aid and successfully got to camp 4, but kumar has not been located. The post says about 60 people managed to get to the top on sunday but quotes guide tendi sherpa as saying the day saw a flurry of helicopter evacuations; bad weather and high winds have left climbers with \" some little keyholes \" during which to get to the top, he says.

There, regina murmura was shot as someone fired 20 bullets into the couple's car, police say. At one point, francisco murmura got out of the car and \" received a rifle butt, \" an official says. \" when i got out, and the guy came with a gun, the best thing he could have done, to me, would have been to put me out and end it, \" francisco says.

Critics are giving the latest robert langdon adventure inferno, based on the dan brown book in which langdon must use dante alighieri's divine comedy to track down a virus with the potential to destroy half the world's population, a terrible 20 % approval rating on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: \" you don't need a hidden set of clues to decipher that inferno is one of the worst movies of the year, \" writes adam graham at the detroit news. It's \" hell. \" the rest of his review is no less harsh. This is \" an undisciplined, scattered mess, with twists and plot revelations unspooling with soap opera uncanniness, \" he says. In fact, \" you wish it would combine with the national treasure movies so nic cage could appear and at least liven things up a bit. \" \" it is hard to overstate how bad this abysmal film is, \" notes colin covert at the minneapolis star tribune. \" scene after scene after scene after scene shows [ langdon ] sprinting to safety as fast as the film makes you want to bolt for the exit. \" it's not all bad, though: irrfan khan portraying the head of an organization in search of the virus \" is by far the witty highlight of the film, the best thing on-screen before the end credits. \" hanks impresses by portraying langdon as \" the smartest man in the room at all times, \" yet also \" an accessible everyman. \" but with lines like, \" this map is a trail he left so that someone can find it, \" it's no surprise this turned out to be such a \" silly and scattered \" flick, writes christy lemire at rogerebert.com. At least khan \" realizes how ridiculous inferno is, and he's having a blast with it. \" leslie felperin, however, says inferno is \" arguably the best in the franchise so far, \" though \" that's not a high bar to jump. \" there's a strong supporting cast, \" satisfyingly delivered \" twists, and \" striking dream imagery, \" she writes at the hollywood reporter.

Here's what the pundits are saying: \" this was the best two hours of her candidacy to date, \" decides chris cillizza at the washington post, praising a \" confident, relaxed, and good-natured \" performance that won the debate by a mile. He notes that she was \" aggressive from the start, \" going after bernie sanders for his past votes on guns and saying it is time the us \" stood up against the nra. \" clinton \" crushed it, \" according to shane goldmacher at politico, who writes that she summarized her candidacy in one line: \" i ' m a progressive. But i ' m a progressive who likes to get things done. \" another standout line, in response to sanders ' praise of scandinavian-style democratic socialism: \" we are not denmark. I love denmark. We are the united states of america. \" clinton easily sidestepped most attacks, including criticism of her 2002 vote in favor of the iraq war, writes josh voorhees at slate. \" i recall very well being on a debate stage, i think, about 25 times with then – sen. Obama debating this very issue, \" she said. \" after the election, he asked me to become secretary of state. \" she also deflected martin o ' malley's accusation that she was too quick to use military force, voorhees notes. \" i was very pleased when gov. O ' malley endorsed me for president in 2008 and i enjoyed his strong support in that campaign, \" she said. Sanders had his moments, but his focus on income inequality was so intense it \" made him sound like a one-note candidate, \" according to frank bruni at the new york times. Bruni and other analysts say that sanders ' best moment was when he defended clinton, saying people are \" sick and tired of hearing about the damn emails. \" none of the other three candidates on the stage got anything close to the breakout moment they needed. Amanda marcotte at salon declares jim webb the biggest loser for his \" petulant \" complaining about not getting enough time to speak, while cillizza at the post thinks lincoln chafee had a \" genuinely awful \" night and gave one of the worst debate answers ever when asked to explain his vote in favor of repealing the glass-steagall financial regulation act.

That teen was jakeem tyler, and his dedication to his job led nelson to grab a photo and write about it on facebook, per cbs news. \" we sneeze too hard &amp; decide to call in, but he's workin like nothing's wrong, \" nelson wrote in his dec. 8 post. Further conversation with jakeem revealed that he had recently been in a car accident, but he told nelson he needed to work for the money — not just for himself and to buy christmas presents, but also to put toward his goal of feeding the homeless this holiday season, an idea he's been working on for months, his parents tell wxin. The group jakeem is supporting: the homeless hoosiers, which works with indiana shelters to help the state's vulnerable. Nelson was so moved by jakeem's work ethic that he created a gofundme page for the teen; it's so far raised more than $ 12,000 to help jakeem's mission along. Jakeem at first had no idea that his picture had gone viral, telling wish that the day nelson met him was just \" a day to work and share the gospel and... Spread love around. \" he adds about his newfound fame: \" i... Don't know what to really say right now because i ' m just in awe still. \" as for how corporate feels about him, chick-fil-a gave a statement to wttv: \" jakeem is a phenomenal young man and an outstanding team member. … we are beyond proud. \" ( this hungry teen asked for doughnuts, received $ 270k. )",

That means kushner will no longer have access to top-secret intelligence; he previously enjoyed unrestricted access to many sensitive documents including the president's daily brief.

Steven mann, 54, pleaded innocent monday in white river junction criminal court to a felony count of cultivating more than 25 marijuana plants. He was released on a $ 10,000 unsecured appearance bond. Windsor police det. Jennifer frank wrote in an affidavit that mann's girlfriend's 8-year-old son told school officials and frank about mann's \"green thumb \" and how he got to help him grow \"special medicine that can cure anything at all. \" frank said the boy described in detail what sounded to her like marijuana plants and then added that mann was giving the plants to \"anyone who needs the medicine. \" a steady stream of people were phoning and coming to the house frequently, the boy said. In his own confession, according to court records, mann wrote that when officers showed up at his front door on friday his girlfriend, leona hunt, \"had just taken a hit when they knocked. \" frank noted there was a significant odor of burnt marijuana when she entered the apartment and said mann handed over a warm glass pipe the couple appeared to have been using in the same room the child was in. Police said they found two \"grow rooms \" next to the child's bedroom; one for starter plants and one for more mature specimens. Police also reported seizing nearly $ 700 in cash and paraphernalia including pipes, rolling papers, bags of marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, bongs, grinders and digital scales. Mann allegedly admitted selling marijuana for $ 10 a joint, or $ 50 for an eighth-of-an-ounce \"slice, \" telling investigators that he did \"90 percent \" of his business in new hampshire and also gave away some marijuana free to at least one elderly windsor resident. Police said further charges are also expected to be filed against hunt in connection with the bust. Court records said the department for children and families has launched its own investigation because of the proximity of the child to the alleged illegal drug operation and also pissibly to the chemicals that were used. Mann, who has no prior criminal record, faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted."

            "White river junction — a second-grader's tales of how he was helping a \"farmer \" grow \"special medicine \" plants led to the bust of a large indoor marijuana growing operation in windsor last week. Steven mann, 54, pleaded innocent monday in white river junction criminal court to a felony count of cultivating more than 25 marijuana plants. He was released on a $ 10,000 unsecured appearance bond. Windsor police det. Jennifer frank wrote in an affidavit that mann's girlfriend's 8-year-old son told school officials and frank about mann's \"green thumb \" and how he got to help him grow \"special medicine that can cure anything at all. \" frank said the boy described in detail what sounded to her like marijuana plants and then added that mann was giving the plants to \"anyone who needs the medicine. \" a steady stream of people were phoning and coming to the house frequently, the boy said. In his own confession, according to court records, mann wrote that when officers showed up at his front door on friday his girlfriend, leona hunt, \"had just taken a hit when they knocked. \" frank noted there was a significant odor of burnt marijuana when she entered the apartment and said mann handed over a warm glass pipe the couple appeared to have been using in the same room the child was in. Police said they found two \"grow rooms \" next to the child's bedroom; one for starter plants and one for more mature specimens. Police also reported seizing nearly $ 700 in cash and paraphernalia including pipes, rolling papers, bags of marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, bongs, grinders and digital scales. Mann allegedly admitted selling marijuana for $ 10 a joint, or $ 50 for an eighth-of-an-ounce \"slice, \" telling investigators that he did \"90 percent \" of his business in new hampshire and also gave away some marijuana free to at least one elderly windsor resident. Police said further charges are also expected to be filed against hunt in connection with the bust. Court records said the department for children and families has launched its own investigation because of the proximity of the child to the alleged illegal drug operation and also pissibly to the chemicals that were used. Mann, who has no prior criminal record, faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted."

Determining why he was there takes more expertise: archaeologists say there are lesions on his tibia that suggest he had a bone infection that slowed down his escape from the city after the ad79 eruption of mt. Vesuvius, cnn reports. They believe the man, who was at least 30 years old, limped as he fled down the alley where his remains were found, \" initial observations would appear to indicate that the individual survived the first eruptive phase of the volcano, and subsequently sought salvation along the alley, \" which was already covered in a thick layer of rocks ejected by the eruption, researchers said in a press release. Researchers say the man was trying to escape a deadly cloud of gas, pumice, ashes, npr reports. They believe the stone block, which was probably a door jamb, was thrown by the force of the deadly cloud. Massimo osanna, general director of the italian site, says the dramatic find shows how technology has transformed archaeology, the ap reports. \" in the 1800s and 1900s, they dug in the area where we found the skeleton, but they did not go as deep as we did, \" he says. \" because of the experts we had, we knew how to do it. \" ( another extraordinary find was made in pompeii's central bath house. )",

Some say the real issue is a longstanding battle between farmers and the salmon fishing industry over california water use, abc news reports. The two sides have argued for years about whether state water should be sustaining salmon needed by fisheries or sent to farms for agricultural use. As it stands, a state water board is mulling whether to allocate more water to fish-populated rivers and less to agriculture — a move opposed by \" central valley farmers and their republican allies, \" says the washington post. Meanwhile, environmental experts say it's climate change, not water supply, that's making this year's wildfires so wild. \" there's zero connection between the fires and the amount of water that is available to fight them, \" says a hydrologist. \" it's weaponizing an ignorant tweet from the president. \"",

        "summary": "A study delving into the well-being of young people came up with two main findings: that people who live in more densely populated areas tend to be less happy, and that the more socializing one does with close friends, the more satisfied that person says he or she is, the washington post reports. But there was one outlier group — people with higher iqs — who didn't seem as bothered by living in crowded areas as their counterparts, and who were less happy the more time they spent with pals. Now, two evolutionary psychologists say they've analyzed the research and think they know why, and it all ties back to our hunter-gatherer roots. In a study published in the british journal of psychology, norman li and satoshi kanazawa say that what made our ancestors happy tends to still have an effect on modern-day populations. While a brookings institution researcher tells the post it could simply be that higher-iq individuals may be \" focused on some other longer term objective \" — which means they could derive more satisfaction toiling on those lofty goals than hanging out with pals — kanazawa and li's theory says intelligent individuals ' capacity to deal better with dense populations may link back to our ancestors who lived on the sparsely populated african savanna and adapted to that surrounding. Although your average joe today may a hard time evolving from that rural-like setting to today's overloaded environment, people with high iqs may be better able to \" solve evolutionarily novel problems \" and adapt better. As for the smarties'spurn of socialization? they may similarly be able to better adapt to solitary activities that their hunter-gatherer brethren rejected for survival purposes.

        "summary": "Tuberculosis may have reached the new world long before christopher columbus ever sailed the ocean blue, a new study suggests. Scientists have examined 1,000-year-old peruvian bones mysteriously infected with tb — 500 years before the arrival of spaniards, who are historically blamed for bringing tb to the new world, nature reports. \" how did ( tb ) get to the americas? we were joking: ' was it flying? was it swimming? ' but then we saw it was indeed swimming. It was disseminated by seals, \" a study author tells the bbc. Researchers believe seals got tb in africa — the same strain found in the peruvian mummies — and swam to america after the land bridge between asia and north america disappeared. Their contaminated meat was then eaten by native americans, nature explains. When the europeans eventually arrived, they brought diseases — including a new tuberculosis strain — that killed 90 % of the native population; the european tb strain remains today. The peruvian strain has also helped scientists put a new date stamp on all modern tb strains: it's not 70,000 years as once thought, but less than 6,000 years old, reports the new york times. This claim is making some scientists skeptical. One expert tells the times that fossil evidence shows tb is older than 6,000 years — including the infected remains of a 9,000-year-old human and 17,000-year-old bison. ( last month, an arrest warrant was issued for a man who refused tb treatment. )",

        "summary": "Scientists have successfully altered a major behavior of two species of lab ants by deleting a single gene. As the washington post reports, the journal cell has just published two papers chronicling the journeys of the first so-called mutant ants. One team reports on how one mutation removed a key aspect of an ant's odor receptors, rendering them incapable of socializing; the other team reports on how another mutation produced \" aberrant social behavior and defective neural development. \" it's being hailed as a success largely due to the complexity of the endeavor; ants are some of the most social insects on the planet, with complex life cycles and genomes. Why deprive ants of their ability to socialize? scientists say the goal was to determine whether ant behavior could be altered genetically. Given a single gene ( called orco ) out of hundreds of olfactory genes has its hand in pretty much the full olfactory system, that seemed the logical one to target — for both research groups. Deleting orco resulted in a loss of roughly 90 % of their \" olfaction, \" and the ants changed in many ways, including laying very few eggs, being poor mothers, avoiding antennae duels, wandering aimlessly, and suffering a change in brain structure, per a science daily news release. Researchers next want to investigate division of labor and an unusual feat of longevity involving queen pheromones. Most workers live for seven months, but those that become \" pseudo-queens \" can hit four years, which is like humans reaching 550 years instead of dying by 85. ( read another study about ants. )",

The mail on sunday has learned that kate had a completely natural birth after arriving at the lindo wing of st mary's hospital, paddington, just after 5.30am last monday. As four midwives monitored the as-yet unborn baby, the queen's former gynaecologist watched closely behind the glass of the £ 5,000-a-night suite. Assisted by two other top medics, marcus setchell – who delayed his retirement to oversee the birth of the third in line to the throne – made sure the birthing plan went without a hitch. Kate's calm demeanour once prince george was in her arms – and the gentle support of her husband prince william – truly moved the seven-strong medical team.

            "More women should endure the agony of labour because pain-relieving drugs, including epidural injections, carry serious medical risks, diminish childbirth as a rite of passage and undermine the mother's bond with her child. These claims from dr denis walsh, one of the country's most influential midwives, have prompted a furious reaction, with other experts saying he has exaggerated the risks of having an epidural. Official figures show that the number of mothers-to-be who receive an epidural, general or spinal anaesthetic has soared in recent years to 36.5 %. Walsh, a senior midwife and associate professor in midwifery at nottingham university, argues that many women avoid experiencing the discomfort of childbirth because hospital maternity staff are too quick to offer an epidural or agree to a woman in labour's request for a pain-killing injection in her back to ease her suffering. \" a large number of women want to avoid pain.

            "11 hours ' labour and all natural! how serene kate sailed through a textbook delivery as she goes through the perfect birth she was hoping for duchess of cambridge gave birth without recourse to powerful painkillers her calm demeanour is said to have moved the seven-strong medical team courageous: the duchess of cambridge, pictured with prince william and their son prince george, had the perfect birth she was hoping for the duchess of cambridge delivered her son perfectly – without recourse to any powerful painkillers. The mail on sunday has learned that kate had a completely natural birth after arriving at the lindo wing of st mary's hospital, paddington, just after 5.30am last monday. As four midwives monitored the as-yet unborn baby, the queen's former gynaecologist watched closely behind the glass of the £ 5,000-a-night suite. Assisted by two other top medics, marcus setchell – who delayed his retirement to oversee the birth of the third in line to the throne – made sure the birthing plan went without a hitch. Kate's calm demeanour once prince george was in her arms – and the gentle support of her husband prince william – truly moved the seven-strong medical team. Although the duchess was in labour for 11 hours, sources in london have told the mail on sunday that she opted not to have powerful painkillers. The precise sequence of events",
            "More women should endure the agony of labour because pain-relieving drugs, including epidural injections, carry serious medical risks, diminish childbirth as a rite of passage and undermine the mother's bond with her child. These claims from dr denis walsh, one of the country's most influential midwives, have prompted a furious reaction, with other experts saying he has exaggerated the risks of having an epidural. Official figures show that the number of mothers-to-be who receive an epidural, general or spinal anaesthetic has soared in recent years to 36.5 %. Walsh, a senior midwife and associate professor in midwifery at nottingham university, argues that many women avoid experiencing the discomfort of childbirth because hospital maternity staff are too quick to offer an epidural or agree to a woman in labour's request for a pain-killing injection in her back to ease her suffering. \" a large number of women want to avoid pain.

Debris fell on a firefighter during the incident, and an engineer inhaled smoke while using a fire extinguisher to try and stop the fire, sakowich said. Both sustained minor injuries, and the engineer refused aid. A third civilian also suffered an injury and was treated on scene, the fdny later said. President donald trump was not at the manhattan high-rise at the time of the fire. He is scheduled to appear at an event in tennessee monday afternoon. Tenants inside trump tower were advised to stay in place, and the building was never evacuated, sakowich said.

Instead, hutchison announced wednesday that she will stay in washington through 2012 to serve out her term, saying she wants to help fight the democratic agenda in congress. \" if you sense an audible sigh of relief in the air, it's every single republican in the u.s.

Having lost that primary rather badly to popular incumbent rick perry — and after taking quite a beating in the race — some wondered whether hutchison would leave public life altogether. According to national journal, hutchison will finish her current term in the senate: sen. Kay bailey hutchison ( r-tx ) will announce today she has decided to serve out the remainder of her term, according to a source familiar with hutchison's plans. The move is a reversal of a pledge hutchison made to step down as she challenged gov. Rick perry ( r ) earlier this year. Hutchison lost an early march primary against perry by a surprisingly wide margin. Hutchison originally said she would step down sometime last fall, before putting off her resignation thanks to the health care debate.

        "summary": "There are cult followings of just about any kind of ( presumably legal ) footage you can imagine on youtube — people popping zits, people blowing bubbles, people ( and other animals ) giving birth, and so on. But there is one type of video that has the outline somewhat perplexed: hiking videos. Hiking is, after all, about stepping away from the screen, so the allure to watch it on a screen makes \" this genre of uploads seem particularly odd. \" examples include youtube user martyupnorth, who boasts more than 10,000 subscribers and posts videos of himself trekking through the wilderness, sharing tips, showing the food and gear he packs, etc. Then there's syntax77, who talks incessantly while hiking and enjoys more than 50,000 subscribers. It's unclear who exactly watches these videos, but the outline is quick to point out the zen-like quality of many of them. The plot is simple, the action slow, the scenery often breathtaking. These are a sort of reality-tv version of nature videos, perhaps popular among hikers trying to relax in their cramped apartments on a work night. With more than 34 million americans hiking trails in 2013, and $ 646 billion spent on outdoor recreation gear every year, these videos blend this love of outdoors with a culture of screens and help \" unravel the idea of outdoor activity as a pure experience, \" per the outline, \" revealing a culture obsessed with not only preserving any and all experiences but anticipating every aspect of those experiences as well. \" ( ever had a brain orgasm on youtube? )",

The gop should take heed, writes jeffrey h. Anderson in the weekly standard.

        "summary": "Bitcoins may be valuable in tech circles, but to a judge in miami-dade county, the virtual money is nothing more than shadow currency. On monday, judge teresa mary pooler discarded felony charges against website designer michell espinoza, who had been accused of transmitting and laundering $ 1,500 in bitcoins — an impossible-to-prove charge since bitcoin isn't actual \" tangible wealth \" that can \" be hidden under a mattress like cash and gold bars, \" per the miami herald. Espinoza had allegedly transferred the bitcoins to undercover detectives for cash, the washington post reports; the detectives said they were going to scoop up stolen credit-card numbers with them. The paper explains how florida law forbids exchanging money for \" illicit \" activity such as the credit card fraud espinoza was accused of trying to abet. But in her eight-page ruling, pooler noted that while she couldn't \" accurately define or describe bitcoin \" — and also couldn't deny that in some ( but not all ) circumstances it could be \" exchanged for items of value, \" like money — neither could she deem that it was actual money, rendering the charges against espinoza moot. Quartz notes how pooler isn't the only one confused about how to categorize bitcoin, with the legal system still struggling with how to deal with the concept. Espinoza's lawyer, not surprisingly, called the judge's decision \" beautifully written \" and said all espinoza had done was \" sell his own personal property. \" the miami-dade state attorney's office is deciding whether to appeal.

That suspect has now been identified as anis amri, believed to be 23 or 24 years old and who a german official has said has ties to radical islamist groups and was deemed a risk, cnn reports. The washington post notes amri had been the subject of a german terror investigation earlier this year. A $ 105,000 reward from german law enforcement for amri, described as being under \" urgent suspicion, \" is on the table, and he's described as being 5 feet 10 inches tall and about 165 pounds. \" if you see this person that we are seeking, inform the police, \" the notice on amri reads. \" please do not put yourself in danger because this person could be violent and armed! \" per cbs news, amri was registered in the state of north rhine-westphalia and had attempted to gain asylum. The state's interior minister tells the bbc that even though asylum was denied in june, deportation papers hadn't yet been completed — partly because tunisia denied amri was a citizen and refused to take him back. A warrant issued for amri holds six different aliases he's used in the past, which is also what's led to his age being somewhat unclear. A tunisian security official tells the local that tunisian anti-terrorism cops questioned amri's parents wednesday. Amri is also said to have four sisters and a brother, though it's unknown if they're also being interrogated. Amri was reportedly arrested more than once in his home country for drug use before he defected to italy in 2011 ( the bbc says 2012 ), where he stayed for three years before heading to germany, the source notes.",

        "summary": "Potholes aren't just uncomfortable to drive over: the damage caused by them costs america's drivers $ 3 billion annually, reports the american automobile association in a study it released wednesday. Good thing, then, that ford's 2017 fusion v6 sport sedan should be able to handle them. The american car company has announced that the tech will be implemented for the first time in midsize non-luxury cars — it's already available in high-end lincolns — a move the detroit news sees as a bid to distinguish the vehicle from the toyota camry and honda accord. \" it reduces the [ impact ] greatly, \" says jason michener, who engineered the technology. Still, he clarifies, the protection isn't total: \" there's always one pothole that no amount of technology will protect you from. \" so how does it work? the car doesn't avoid the pothole by driving around it, but rather houses a smart shock-absorbing system that stiffens when sensors detect that a wheel is entering a pothole, reports cnnmoney. This detection, in turn, keeps the wheel in an \" elevated \" position so that it does not drop down into the pothole. That action then triggers the rear wheel's shock absorber to follow suit. ( this video from ford uses ping-pong balls to illustrate. ) ford has a 1.2-mile road course in belgium full of replicas of some of the worst potholes — and other hazards such as cobblestones and speed bumps — drivers face. Testers get to race over them as fast as 45mph to further test and improve the technology. ( this pothole may have led to a father and son's death. )",

        "summary": "Before us special operations forces raided the pakistani compound where osama bin laden was hiding out in 2011, there was likely at least one other type of specialist with boots on the ground: a weatherman. The air force's sowts — special operations weather technicians — are some of the military's least-recognized tools, with members sent out to infiltrate enemy lines ( where weather reports from the ground can often be scarce ) and tap into their meteorology training to gauge climate conditions for their commanders, nbc news reports. These grey berets not only predict if the weather is amenable to launching an attack ( unmanned aircraft and low-flying choppers have to be especially careful in bad weather ); they also use the weather to their advantage, perhaps using mountain dew to erase tracks, or wind to dampen the sounds of a chopper, nbc explains. \" we're human sensors, \" sowt jonathan sawtelle tells nbc. A persistent issue for sowts is not being taken seriously by colleagues, an attitude that riles environmental mercenaries. \" in special operations, most of the failures have weather as a causal effect, \" an ex-director of environmental services for joint special operations command tells nbc. And training for this role is brutal — including getting kicked in the ribs by instructors and sprayed with water during exercises to trigger drowning fears — and requires a minimum intelligence-test score that's higher than that of nearly every other role in the military. As nbc puts it, recruits are \" warriors first, meteorologists second. \" one sowt compares it to high school, with other special-ops troops as the starting qbs and homecoming kings, and military meteorologists \" kind of like the valedictorians.... We've got the 4.0 grade point average, but we can play a little, too. \" ( read the entire story about this fascinating military career. )",

Reuters/jim young the bill passed the republican-controlled house 241 to 184, largely along party lines, and sets up a confrontation with both the republican-majority senate and the democratic obama administration. The white house has threatened to veto the house bill, saying it was \"woefully inadequate. \" the obama administration has requested $ 1.9 billion. On tuesday, the senate cleared the way for expected approval by the chamber on thursday of $ 1.1 billion to fight the mosquito-borne zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects. Unlike the senate legislation, the house bill requires that the $ 622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere. Many conservative republicans in the house refuse to approve zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while democrats and some senate republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts.

Upon the discovery of the first victim — a black servant girl named mollie smith, who had been \" ripped open like a calf at a slaughterhouse \" — law enforcement's only suspect was an ex-boyfriend, despite his having an alibi. As the killings continued, per esquire, \" clueless police officers and bumbling private detectives \" focused their attention on \" uneducated young black men. \" but later, some became convinced that the killer was \" a diabolical but brilliant … man driven to destroy one woman after another in almost ritualistic fashion. \" detectives in london later toyed with the idea that the midnight assassin had moved to england and was jack the ripper.

        "summary": "Out of the many different types of people having sex out there, it seems that when it comes to reaching orgasm, straight women are at the bottom of the totem pole. Reporting in the journal archives of sexual behavior, researchers at the kinsey institute, chapman university, and indiana university found that 95 % of straight men usually-to-always orgasm when sexually intimate compared to 65 % of straight women. They call it \" the orgasm gap. \" the study is called \" differences in orgasm frequency among gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual men and women in a u.s. National sample, \" though a reporter at the chicago tribune suggests it could be shortened to \" duh. \" the study, however, doesn't just document the gap — it offers a remedy in the form of what the researchers call a \" golden trio \" of moves, per the huffington post uk. Surveying more than 50,000 people, they found that 89 % of gay men usually-to-always orgasm when sexually intimate, followed by bisexual men ( 88 % ), lesbian women ( 86 % ), and bisexual women ( 66 % ). The research suggests that three techniques might improve the percentages for women — a combination of deep kissing, genital stimulation, and oral sex. More specifically, they note that oral sex is the surest bet a woman will orgasm, followed by duration — 0 to 15 minutes leads to the lowest frequency for women, while more than 30 minutes leads to the highest. Meanwhile, 30 % of men think that intercourse is the best way to get a woman to orgasm, which rarely if ever works for nearly half of women. \" to say that there needs to be some education i think is an understatement, \" one researcher tells the guardian. ( yes, some women actually orgasm during childbirth. )",

        "summary": "After recounts, florida has a new governor and a new senator — and broward county is going to get a new elections supervisor. Broward supervisor of elections brenda snipes handed in her resignation sunday, hours after a manual recount finished and democrat bill nelson conceded the senate election to gov. Rick scott, the sun sentinel reports. Snipes, 75, was attacked as corrupt and incompetent by scott, president trump, and other prominent republicans during the recount process. Her resignation comes after two weeks in which her staff misplaced 2,000 ballots, mixed more than 20 invalid ballots in with 200 good ones, and missed a deadline to submit recount results, reports the miami herald. Snipes ' 15 years in the role began in 2003 when then-gov. Jeb bush appointed her to replace a predecessor who was fired for incompetence. She was re-elected in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 despite numerous controversies and complaints in the heavily democratic county. Earlier this year, a judge discovered that snipes had prematurely destroyed thousands of ballots from the 2016 primaries. In 2016, a medical marijuana question was left off some ballots — and in 2012, a box with 1,000 uncounted ballots was found in a warehouse. Sources tell the sun sentinel that snipes will be leaving in early january, meaning her replacement will be appointed by gov.-elect ron desantis instead of scott. Who accused her of trying to steal the election. ( trump, who called for snipes to be fired, claimed that people were donning disguises to vote illegally. )",

The fetus, which reportedly had developed to the point of having hair, legs, hands, and genitals, was surgically removed from the 15-year-old boy, according to fox news, which quotes a report by central european news. \" the fetus removed from my son's stomach was formed with organs like those of a baby — only the nose and mouth were not complete, \" the teen's mother says. This is believed to be the first case of \" fetus in fetu \" known to have occurred in malaysia, medical daily reports, noting that it happens about once per 500,000 births. Medical daily explains the fetus in this situation is typically \" located in the retroperitoneal area — or the space between the membrane lining the cavity of the abdomen and the posterior abdominal wall. \" indeed, mohd zul shahril saidin had an \" oddly rounded shape tummy \" and had periodically sought medical attention since he was a year old, malaysian digest reports. According to the digest, the teen had been able to live an active life as a child, including playing sports, but his protruding stomach had more recently begun to interfere with his movement and the pain intensified last month. The family, which has a total of eight children, held a funeral for the fetus, which is now buried at a cemetery, the mirror reports. ( this preserved fetus likely is the youngest egyptian mummy. )",

Family members of martin say bud, an african grey parrot, seems to replay the murder — mimicking what sounds like two voices, a male and a female, in argument. \"don't f — ing shoot, \" the bird says on a video that the family says it took several weeks after the shooting.

According to marty's parents, charles and lillian, it stemmed from a domestic fight that got out of hand. \" no matter what happens i lose, i lost a son and i ' m gonna lose a daughter-in-law, \" said charles duram. \" but when i wake up in the morning my wife ain't crying and asking for justice, i can live with that. \" duram's parents told fox 17 in october 2015, apparent suicide notes were found in the days after the killing, allegedly written by glenna in the couple's home. A handgun believed to be the murder weapon was also found. There was also an unlikely alleged witness to the crime, duram's pet parrot named bud who's now living with his ex-wife, christian keller. \" bud was mine and marty's parrot when we were married, \" said keller. \" he ended up keeping bud for the 15 years we have been not married, i got bud back after this situation had happened.

It turned out to be a small gold tooth, but it wasn't the material that led dick portillo to pay landowners $ 14,000 to take it home to illinois, reports the ap. Rather, it was portillo's belief that the tooth might've belonged to isoroku yamamoto, the japanese naval commander who orchestrated the attack on pearl harbor more than a year before his plane was shot down by us pilots. \" if it comes to be true, it's peanuts compared to the value that i would look at, \" portillo, 76 — who sold his portillo's hot dog chain for a reported $ 1 billion in 2014 — tells the chicago tribune. The former marine is betting on more than gut instinct: yamamoto was hit with a large-caliber round to the jaw, and dentists agree this tooth was forcefully removed. Yamamoto's body was also found in the front left area of the wreckage, near where the tooth was found. However, there were 10 other men on the plane, all of whom died, so the tooth could have belonged to any of them. Dental records for yamamoto aren't known to exist, but portillo plans to \" do whatever it takes \" to get to the bottom of the mystery, including examining the tooth for dna. If it is linked to yamamoto, portillo says he ' ll give it to the japanese government and perhaps make a documentary. \" i don't want to make any money, \" he says. \" the value to me is the fun, the experience. \" ( a war hero's dog tag is finally back home. )",

In the first, published in drug and alcohol dependence, researchers say they've found that marijuana users seem to have an \" increased vulnerability \" to developing an alcohol use disorder ( defined as alcohol abuse or dependence ) as compared to their pot-free counterparts. They used data on 27,461 adults who took part in the national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions and reported having no aud in 2001 and 2002 ( aka, \" wave 1 \" ). Fast-forward three years to \" wave 2, \" and those who reported marijuana use originally were 5.4 times more likely to have an aud, per the study. The second study, published in jama psychiatry, made use of nesarc data as well, but a slightly broader slice: 34,653 adults. Its findings were broader as well: those who used pot in wave 1 were roughly six times more likely to have any kind of substance use disorder three years later; when it specifically came to an aud, this study found they were 2.7 times more likely to have developed one ( the reason for the discrepancy is unclear ). Those researchers also looked at other drug use disorders and nicotine dependence; the likelihood was higher for pot smokers in both cases. But a psychology professor and legalization advocate tells healthday he's skeptical. As far as the pot-to-other-drugs \" gateway \" theory goes, \" i am unable to see this association after 40 years of clinical experience. \" ( another study finds that teens who smoke pot don't get dumber as a result. )",

Researchers reviewed records from three hospitals over a 13-year period in campinas, brazil, a city of roughly 3 million people. In a paper published in advances in urology in april but now attracting plenty of attention, they write that the \" cowgirl \" — when the woman is on top of the man — was responsible for half the penile fractures reported among the cases involving heterosexual sex. The second-worst offender was doggy style, responsible for 29 %, while the traditional missionary position had been assumed in 21 % of the fractures, reports the telegraph. Still, penis fractures are rare — so much so that there isn't really a known statistic for the injury, reports cosmopolitan. Over 13 years of hospital records in campinas, only a total of 42 men had \" the condition confirmed after clinical, radiological, and surgical evaluation, \" the researchers report. As a side note: 28 of those 42 fractures occurred during heterosexual sex, 4 during homosexual sex, 6 due to \" penile manipulation, \" and 4 in \" unclear \" circumstances. Researchers surmise that when the woman is on top, \" she usually controls the movement with her entire body weight landing on the erect penis, not being able to interrupt it when the penis suffers a wrong way penetration. \" ( this man's decision to have sex in a desert ended up costing him big-time. )",

University of pittsburgh researchers found that while the frequency of sex declines, the quality makes up for it. \"we were surprised to find a group of women who said that sex actually got better for them as they got older, \" says lead author holly thomas. \"as doctors we were assuming that sex gets worse for women. \" after interviewing 39 women between ages 46 and 59, thomas and her team cited several factors behind women who experienced a better sex life, including knowing their bodies better and increased self confidence to ask for what they want. A larger survey from case western of 505 women between the ages of 40 and 75 found much the same, reports today. \" they had a better knowledge and understanding of their own bodies as they got older. And they felt more comfortable and empowered to communicate their sexual needs to their partner than when they were younger, \" thomas said, per webmd. When women weren't experiencing good sex, they pointed to other side of the bed, citing their partner's low libido or erectile dysfunction. Lower libido was also a complaint of some women in the study, along with vaginal dryness. The new research builds on thomas ' previous findings that women over 60 were having a lot of sex, contrary to popular notions. Other research has found that older women who have frequent sex experience benefits such as lower blood pressure, while the opposite is true for older men who risk heart attacks.

The white house said countries needed to accept that assad's rule was doomed, and stop shielding him in the security council. \" it is important that the security council take action, \" white house spokesman jay carney said. \" we believe that the security council should not permit the assad regime to assault the syrian people while it rejects the arab league's",

Russia continues to block a draft un security council resolution calling for a transfer of power in syria, where it maintains a naval base at tartous, near latakia.

The russian foreign ministry had warned the syrian opposition that moscow was counting on its participation in the talks. \" we are expecting that the opposition will also give their assent in the next days and put the interests of the syrian people before any other ideas, \" it said.

Al franken had emerged in recent months as a leading voice in opposition to president donald trump, a progressive powerhouse raising millions of dollars for democrats across the country and frequently appearing on lists of potential 2020 presidential contenders. Now, with one photograph, his political clout has come crashing down. A los angeles radio personality's story of being kissed and groped by franken in 2006 — complete with a picture of him leering as his hands suggestively hovered over her chest as she slept — has added the minnesota democrat to a rapidly growing list of powerful, famous men accused of sexual misconduct. Suddenly a senator whose statewide approval rating stood at 58 percent in the last star tribune minnesota poll is facing calls to resign — even from prominent minnesota dflers and deeply disappointed supporters.

            "– a political star on the rise, sen. Al franken had emerged in recent months as a leading voice in opposition to president donald trump, a progressive powerhouse raising millions of dollars for democrats across the country and frequently appearing on lists of potential 2020 presidential contenders. Now, with one photograph, his political clout has come crashing down. A los angeles radio personality's story of being kissed and groped by franken in 2006 — complete with a picture of him leering as his hands suggestively hovered over her chest as she slept — has added the minnesota democrat to a rapidly growing list of powerful, famous men accused of sexual misconduct. Suddenly a senator whose statewide approval rating stood at 58 percent in the last star tribune minnesota poll is facing calls to resign — even from prominent minnesota dflers and deeply disappointed supporters. As he faces an ethics investigation in the u.s.

For now, abortions take place in secret: estimates in chile range from 15,000 to 200,000 abortions annually, per the guardian; human rights watch puts that number at 160,000 per year, with 64,000 of them happening to girls under the age of 18.
