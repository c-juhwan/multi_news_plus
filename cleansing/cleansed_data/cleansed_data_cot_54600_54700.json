        "summary": "More than half a century before aids even had a name, the hiv virus was already spreading across africa via the city now known as kinshasa, researchers say. In the 1920s, the city was leopoldville, capital of the belgian congo, and scientists say a \" perfect storm \" of conditions caused the pandemic to emerge, the bbc reports. The fast-growing city was full of transient male workers who visited prostitutes, researchers say. Sexually transmitted diseases were rife, and unsterilized needles at health clinics also helped spread the disease, according to a study published in the journal science. Researchers studied hiv's genetic code as well as historical documents. The researchers note that strains of hiv have been transmitted from primates to humans at least 13 times, but only one has caused a global epidemic. They believe a key factor in the 1920s spread was the congo's booming transport network early last century, which saw a million people travel through kinshasa every year on the railways alone, reports reuters. Researchers say the disease was at first confined to specific groups of people, but it started to spread into the general population and around the world after 1960, the guardian reports. It took genetic research to track the pandemic back to its source because the disease hits the immune system, meaning victims died from any of a wide variety of infections, making the spread of hiv before it was identified hard to track through medical records, says the lead researcher, an evolutionary biologist. ( hiv has infected 75 million people, but un officials say real progress is being made and the epidemic could be over by 2030. )",

Then came the surprise news that some of those workers will be out of a job as the company is closing 63 sam's club locations, or about 10 % of the stores.

The closures are spread across the country, but some states are hit worse than others. Illinois, for instance, is losing six locations.

The annual october festival in yellville sees turkeys hurled from buildings and a plane flying 500 feet above the ground. Disturbed? you're not alone. Tommy lee is among those to bash the \" sick \" tradition, reports arkansas online. Live science explains the uproar: domestic turkeys are bred for flightlessness, their bodies too heavy for their wings to get them off the ground. While their wings can slow a descent, there's no guarantee domestic turkeys will survive falls from great heights. The same is true of wild turkeys, which can only fly short distances. Indeed, two turkeys dropped from a plane last year died on impact. At least four turkeys dropped this year were found injured and bleeding, though they've since found refuge at a new york shelter, where they were named john, ringo, george, and paul, per the fairfield citizen. The town of yellville technically stopped throwing turkeys in 1989 — continuing the turkey trot festival started in 1946 with a dance, race, and parade — but local pilots continue to throw turkeys, per the citizen and baxter bulletin. Despite animal activists ' appeals, the faa says it doesn't have the authority to intervene. \" faa regulations do not specifically prohibit dropping live animals from aircraft, possibly because the authors of the regulation never anticipated that an explicit prohibition would be necessary, \" a rep tells the huffington post, adding, \" this does not mean we endorse the practice. \"",

But last month's budget contained language that forces the government to plan for restarting these paper mailings. Ridiculous? not according to a group called consumers for paper options, which lobbied for that change and has since 2010 been \" advocating for access to paper-based services and information, \" as the group puts it. But though the group says it's a \" coalition of individuals and organizations, \" it's actually a product of the paper industry, the washington post reports: it was established by the envelope manufacturers association and gets funding from the top paper-industry trade group. The treasury expects to save $ 1 billion over a decade following its 2013 move to largely paperless communications, noting that processing a paper check costs $ 1.25, which is $ 1.16 cents more than the cost of an electronic payment. ( it hasn't stopped paper mailings to the elderly and people with \" mental impairments, \" the post notes. ) but \" if there are americans who can't use an iphone to navigate the internet, there ought to be an option for them, \" says a rep for consumers for paper options, noting that a quarter of the us lacks internet access. He also cites a study that says 73 % of adults don't believe they should have to deal with the government online. That study was run by the group. A recent op-ed in roll call signed by a pair of congressmen also pushed for paper; it turns out consumers for paper options was involved in that piece, too.

As mobile providers revolutionize our daily lives with each new gadget and companies tout the simplicity of e-commerce and social networking, it's all too easy to forget that this technology is simply not accessible for millions of americans, especially seniors. The transformative power of technology is real, but so is the digital divide. Across the country, more than 25 percent of americans lack internet access, and seniors are especially likely to be without technology. More than 50 percent of americans over age 65 lack internet access, while nearly half of them do not even own a computer. Seniors make up the lion's share of the more than 30 million households — a quarter of our population — that are being left behind while the rest of america goes online.

As mobile providers revolutionize our daily lives with each new gadget and companies tout the simplicity of e-commerce and social networking, it's all too easy to forget that this technology is simply not accessible for millions of americans, especially seniors. The transformative power of technology is real, but so is the digital divide. Across the country, more than 25 percent of americans lack internet access, and seniors are especially likely to be without technology. More than 50 percent of americans over age 65 lack internet access, while nearly half of them do not even own a computer. Seniors make up the lion's share of the more than 30 million households — a quarter of our population — that are being left behind while the rest of america goes online. While great strides are being made to deliver technology to more americans, we are not there yet. Yet despite this deep digital divide, government agencies are increasingly choosing to eliminate traditional access to paper-based services and information — leaving millions of americans, especially seniors, behind. Federal agencies, from the treasury to the social security administration, are now forcing americans — even those who lack internet and even computer access — to go online to interact with their government. And",

( matt rourke/ap ) as the obama administration pushes to do more business over the internet, finally seeking to close the technology gap with the private sector, the digital makeover is running into a dogged opponent called consumers for paper options. The group is working the halls of congress in closed-door meetings, underwriting research favorable to its position and mounting a news media campaign in an effort to preserve washington as the capital of paper — and slow the move away from printed checks, forms and other paper communication. The lobbying group has had some recent victories, including language tucked into last month's budget deal that requires the government to plan for resuming paper delivery of annual social security earnings statements to some of the nation's 150 million future retirees. And it's been claiming these wins in the name of the elderly and low-income americans the internet has left behind. Except consumers for paper options is a creation of the paper industry. The group — which bills itself as \"a coalition of individuals and organizations advocating for access to paper-based services and information \" — was set up by the envelope manufacturers association ( ema ), officials"

Kitchen and bathroom floors, for instance, are nasty places where a 0-second rule is wise. The sidewalk, on the other hand, is safer because it's less likely to harbor the germs that cause illness. A kitchen floor \" is probably a zero-second zone because the bacteria from uncooked meat and chicken juices are more hazardous than the 'soil ' bacteria outside, \" says one medical expert on the subject. Ditto for a bathroom floor because \" it's a great potential source of bacteria and shorter-lived viruses that can cause gastrointestinal illness if ingested. \"",

The jewish chronicle reports that some of himmler's diaries were discovered in the 1950s, and hundreds of letters surfaced in tel aviv more recently; these \" service diaries \" were reportedly taken by the red army, archived in podolsk near moscow, and forgotten. Germany's bild newspaper on tuesday began serializing the diaries, and the times of london has details. Himmler began many days with a lengthy massage in an effort to assuage chronic stomach cramps. Hours of meetings would follow ( one entry shows 19 policy meetings in a four-hour span ); meetings occurred with 1,600 people over the course of the diaries. The times reports plenty of innocuous moments: looking at the stars and planned phone calls with his daughter gudrun, identified as \" puppi. \" but interspersed are execution orders, the purchase of guard dogs for auschwitz, and movements that sound innocuous but were anything but. A february 2, 1943, entry lists a visit to the sobibor death camp for \"inspection of special commando \"; the times reports his visit was to include a demonstration of gassing, and 400 women and girls were reportedly brought to the camp from a nearby city for that purpose. The german historical institute has authenticated the diaries, and its director says that what appears to be \" rather dry \" is actually very valuable. \" we get a better structural understanding of the last phase of the war, \" says nikolaus katzer.

The 21-year-old college student was abducted on oct. 7, 1998 and driven to a remote area east of laramie, wyo., where he was tied to a fence, beaten with the butt of a pistol and left to die. Almost 18 hours later, he was found by a bicyclist who at first mistook him for a scarecrow. Shepard died five days later at poudre valley hospital in fort collins, colo. — setting off a wave of protests and activism that led to the passage of the matthew shepard and james byrd jr. Hate crimes prevention act, which expanded federal hate crime laws to include attacks motivated by a victim's gender or sexual orientation. His attackers, who pretended to be gay in order to lure shepard, will spend the rest of their lives behind bars. Since shepard's death, his friends and family have honored his legacy by fighting to enact anti-hate crime legislation and protect minority populations through the matthew shepard foundation. Jason marsden, executive director of the matthew shepard foundation, said the occasion of the anniversary allowed him to reflect on social progress that's occurred since his friend's death — and change that still needs to happen. \"it's meaningful to process how much time has gone by, \" he said. \"obviously, now, we are in a very different position with same-sex marriage being legal nationwide. \" while significant strides have been made for the lgbt population over the past two decades, a tremendous amount of work remains to be done, marsden said.

Oddly, the sperm of good-looking guys — but not necessarily macho ones with square jaws and distinct cheekbones — is just fine, reports medical daily. The link was found when researchers analyzed the semen of 62 caucasian men, then compared its motility and structure to facial measurements of masculine traits and ratings of their attractiveness, the huffington post explains. Scientists theorize that the macho man trades virility for a gravely voice and ripped arms, and high testosterone hinders sperm production. Meanwhile, the study casts doubt on the belief the \" phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis \" ( read: fancy feathers and pretty songs attract more ladies ) applies to humans. A study that claimed short guys are preferred by women over tall ones, long believed to have the evolutionary upper hand, has also poked holes in that theory. But don't revamp your mating habits just yet, girls — researchers say their findings need further study. ( short guys are also less likely to divorce you. )",

            "Guys with classically masculine facial features, such as square jawlines and pronounced cheekbones, may produce sperm of a lower quality than men who don't share the same features, a new study finds. The findings rely on an oft-studied phenomenon in the animal kingdom known as the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis. It states the greater presence of male sexual ornaments signals a stronger vitality for reproduction. These ornaments are typically anatomical in nature, such as the set of feathers on one species of bird or the song of another. But in humans the hypothesis hasn't gotten much attention. So researchers recruited a group of 62 college students, from both colombia and spain, to rate the physical attractiveness of select pictures of men who had donated their sperm earlier in the experiment.

From the brooding and sultry looks of hollywood favorites, like george clooney and david beckham, women swoon over these men because of their celebrated physical attractiveness. However, science suggests setting your sights on much shorter, dark and handsome men, like tom cruise, because they make better life partners. According to a recent study ( not peer reviewed ), short men have a higher income and are more likely to stay monogamous, making better boyfriends and husbands, and standing head and shoulders above their much taller peers. Short men have been stigmatized in society because of their stature. The cultural vision of taller men as being physically dominant and potential protectors has been embedded into the psyche of many women, creating a \"prejudice \" against shorter men. It's unclear whether",
            "Guys with classically masculine facial features, such as square jawlines and pronounced cheekbones, may produce sperm of a lower quality than men who don't share the same features, a new study finds. The findings rely on an oft-studied phenomenon in the animal kingdom known as the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis. It states the greater presence of male sexual ornaments signals a stronger vitality for reproduction. These ornaments are typically anatomical in nature, such as the set of feathers on one species of bird or the song of another. But in humans the hypothesis hasn't gotten much attention. So researchers recruited a group of 62 college students, from both colombia and spain, to rate the physical attractiveness of select pictures of men who had donated their sperm earlier in the experiment. Researchers censored all but the subjects ' faces, including hairstyle, to minimize external influences. Ketrin1407, cc by"

        "summary": "An incredible tale of bravery may have surfaced thanks to new \" pixel signature \" technology applied to 14-year-old videos — but it's a complicated revelation. The new york times reports those videos, shot by overheard aircraft on march 4, 2002, may show air force technical sergeant john chapman fighting al-qaeda militants and killing two while alone on a mountaintop in afghanistan. What's so shocking about the footage is not just the bravery. It's that chapman was supposed to be dead. He was originally there with members of seal team 6, providing support as their radioman. In the midst of a fierce and disastrous operation, senior chief petty officer britt slabinski determined the men needed to get off the mountain. Slabinski couldn't verify the wounded chapman was dead, but he was nearly certain. So a \" dead \" chapman was left behind. The air force now suspects chapman was alive for roughly another hour and tried to provide cover for a helicopter carrying army ranger reinforcements ( three rangers were among seven americans to die that day; some say blame rests at the seals ' feet ). The conclusion comes thanks to technology that assigns those on the ground a pixel signature that can be tracked even when ground cover blocks a man from view. The air force secretary wants chapman given the medal of honor; seal team 6 has no issue with that, but hasn't taken a stance on whether chapman was alive. Slabinski is outwardly skeptical, and suggests the air force would welcome a medal of honor, which it hasn't seen one of its own get since vietnam. But a fresh look at chapman's autopsy may provide further proof he was alive. Read the full story at the times.",

The battle occurred less than three months after bin laden had escaped at tora bora, and american commanders still hoped to capture or kill senior qaeda leaders. Chief slabinski's plan was to land by helicopter near the base of the 10,000-foot mountain around midnight and climb up stealthily, but a series of delays involving aircraft left no time to do that before dawn. Under pressure from superiors, he said, he reluctantly flew to the peak at about 3 a.m. Unbeknown to the seals, qaeda forces were already there, and they hit the helicopter with heavy fire. One of chief slabinski's men, petty officer first class neil c. Roberts, fell out about 10 feet above the ground, and the pilot could not retrieve him before the stricken aircraft crash-landed a few miles away.

But the romney camp has denied the allegations and said it hopes new hampshire maintains its first-in-the-nation primary.michele bachmann was reportedly also considering boycotting the debate, although her campaign later clarified that she would be in attendance. But she and rick santorum are considering joining huntsman and newt gingrich, who have said they won't participate in the caucus itself unless new hampshire and iowa are accommodated.

Court documents say police who showed up sunday at the lighthouse landings apartment complex found the brothers wandering around naked, and noah batz admitted to cops they'd both partaken of some psychedelic mushrooms, with his brother adding pot-smoking to the mix. The mind-altering drugs may explain what allegedly happened before cops arrived. One witness says it began when she emerged from her apartment to see the brothers yelling and lying \" completely naked \" on top of each other on the sidewalk, the court report notes. The woman says noah batz then chased her and clocked her in the forehead. Also per court docs, a second witness, the apartment complex manager, says she spotted the brothers \" passionately … making out \" in front of a dumpster and that noah batz also went after her ( she says she locked herself in her car while he screamed he was going to kill her ). The brothers, who reportedly jumped and banged on other cars, also allegedly gave cops a hard time during their arrest, with noah batz ending up stun-gunned. \" it was something beyond just being drunk or high, \" one of the witnesses tells wxin. \" not a good batch of whatever he got. \" the batzes pleaded not guilty wednesday to 17 charges combined, including disorderly conduct, obscene performance, and incest.

But north korea seems to be hedging its bets after a south korean military official said that 50 of its northern foe's submarines have disappeared, the yonhap news agency reports. \" seventy percent of north korea's submarines left their bases, and their locations are not confirmed, \" an official told reporters yesterday, adding, per chosun ilbo, \" scores of subs that have left their bases on the eastern and western coasts are off our radar, which is an unprecedentedly serious situation. \" the main concern is that the subs could cross the northern limit line ( the maritime line in the sand between the two countries ) or take on south korean navy vessels in surprise attacks from the rear, the paper notes. It adds that although north korean submarines — described by the national post as \" largely outdated and technically obsolescent versions produced in the 1960s for the soviet union \" — make a lot of noise ( meaning they should be easy to find ), there are so many missing it would be hard to keep track of them all. Also worrisome, per the military official: north korea has apparently doubled its number of artillery troops along the dmz since friday, per chosun ilbo. \" they seem ready to shoot, \" the official says.

        "summary": "Donald trump delivered what one analyst calls a \" surprisingly serious \" speech on foreign policy and counterterrorism monday — but serious may not equal coherent. Many analysts were taken aback by the mix of proposals in the speech, which included policies favored by the obama and george w. Bush administrations, along with ideas dating back to the cold war and some touches that were pure trump. A roundup of reactions: some elements of trump's speech on the war on \" radical islamic terrorism \" were familiar, but what was new was \" alarming, \" according to the los angeles times editorial board. His calls for a cold war-style \" ideological screening test \" and a commission on radical islam could be \" catastrophically counterproductive, \" they write — and \" would punish thoughts rather than deeds, \" as well as encourage newcomers to the us to conceal their beliefs. Former bush administration official peter feaver tells the new york times that he gives trump credit for the \" surprisingly serious \" speech, but a striking amount of it \" depends on counterterrorism ideas developed by the bush administration. \" the \" good parts are not new, \" and \" the new parts are not good, \" he says. Robert burns at the ap believes there was a lot more obama than bush in trump's disdain for nation-building. Obama ditched bush's large-scale projects in iraq and afghanistan while \" trying to keep enough us influence there to prevent those two countries from crumbling, \" he writes, noting that trump's argument that the us should have seized iraq's oil isn't nation-building, it's \" nation-grabbing. \" john noonan, jeb bush's former national security adviser, tells nbc news that trump is completely correct about obama's contribution to the rise of isis, and not much else. \" the rest of his foreign policy is an absolutely blathering jumble of nonsense, \" he says. \" i can't in good conscience sign my name to it. \" at politico, nahal toosi looks at the \" extreme vetting \" proposal that has replaced trump's ban on muslim immigration and finds numerous problems. She notes that focusing on regions with a \" history of exporting terrorism \" would include much of europe, even if only islamist-inspired terrorism is included. Trump seemed bored by much of his own speech and only seemed excited when congratulating himself on his prescience or accusing hillary clinton of \" wanting to be ' america's angela merkel, ' \" per the lexington column at the economist.

        "summary": "Microwave weapons? that's the latest theory being floated to explain the mysterious ailments suffered by staffers at the american embassy in cuba. But now a pioneering scientist in that field thinks the idea — based on a principle called the microwave auditory effect — is bogus. Kenneth foster is a professor of bioengineering at penn who explained the auditory effect in a 1974 study. At scientific american, he assesses what's known about the cuban ailments and lays out why it's \" wildly implausible \" that microwaves are to blame. For one thing, any such weapon powerful enough to cause brain damage would almost certainly burn the victims, too, and that didn't happen. Instead, foster suggests that a much simpler explanation is likely. \" it is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spytech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel, \" he writes. Foster cites this earlier investigation from the ap revealing the sounds that the victims are believed to have heard, and he says the sounds are consistent with ultrasound devices interacting with each other. It makes sense to him that the cubans might have been trying to listen in on americans with these relatively common gizmos. \" the incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 us election, and the cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about us intentions. \" a cuban scientist, meanwhile, agrees that the microwave theory is far-fetched. \" first, it was sonic weapons, now microwave, \" he told cnn. \" what's next, kryptonite? \"",

Huma, who aspired to become a nurse, is the 10th person in the us to die after a takata airbag's inflator broke apart and sprayed shrapnel into a vehicle's cabin, cbs new york reports. More than 100 people have been injured. A recall last year included some 29 million cars by many manufacturers, but only a quarter of those have been repaired. And that doesn't always seem to be the fault of vehicle owners. One long island woman tells cbs that she received a recall notice that read in part, \" at the present time, we do not have parts available. \" honda says huma's civic was part of the recall and that the company sent notices to multiple people who had owned the car, \" including the current registered owner. \" the repair, however, was never completed. Huma's family tells cbs she didn't know about the recall. During a press conference, her brother urged vehicle owners to find out whether they may have a defective airbag and, if they do, to \" get it fixed before you lose a loved one. \" ( this young woman was injured in a bizarre car accident. )",

Though millhiser notes there may be a waiting period and logistical obstacles for same-sex couples, he writes that looming marriages \" will make it very difficult for the supreme court to reverse course — and retroactively invalidate those marriages — in a subsequent opinion. \" over at slate, mark joseph stern calls the court's move \" unexpected and somewhat bizarre, \" citing his own slate piece last week in which he noted justice ruth bader ginsburg's recent comments that there was \" no need for [ the supreme court ] to rush \" until circuit courts found same-sex marriage bans to be constitutional. He brings up one other interesting point: \" if no circuit court ever rules against gay marriage, the gay marriage question will be effectively settled, and the supreme court will never have to wade in again. \" agreeing that \" almost no one expected that to happen, \" lyle denniston writes at scotusblog that the decision was so surprising because: the supreme court had actually been asked to review all seven state cases ( \" a rare thing … that almost never fails to assure review \" ); that the court appeared to have given recent indications it was ready \" to confront the basic issue \"; and that today's decision doesn't exactly sync up with last year's ruling in united states v. Windsor, which struck a major blow to the defense of marriage act, as per the ap. Jonathan h. Adler at the washington post, however, wasn't terribly surprised, mainly because all petitions before the supreme court had already been nixed by lower circuit courts. Instead, adler wants to know — especially since the decision came with zero comment from the judges — \" is what justice anthony kennedy thinks. … is he ready and willing to hold that the constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage? or is he still conflicted given his federalist sympathies? \"",

Trump hails the start of his long-sought southern border wall, proudly tweeting... ( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — president donald trump hailed the start of his long-sought u.s.-mexico border wall this past week, proudly tweeting photos of the \" wall! \" actually, no new work got underway. The photos showed the continuation of an old project to replace 2 miles of existing barrier. And on saturday, he ripped amazon with a shaky claim that its contract with the post office is a \" scam. \" trump and his officials departed from reality on a variety of subjects in recent days: the census, amazon's practices and the makeup of the supreme court among them. Here's a look at some statements and their veracity: trump: \" great briefing this afternoon on the start of our southern border wall! \" — tweet wednesday, showing photos of workers building a fence. Trump: \" we're going to be starting work, literally, on monday, on not only some new wall -- not enough, but we're working that very quickly -- but also fixing existing walls and existing acceptable fences. \" — trump, speaking the previous week after signing a bill financing the government. The facts: trump's wrong. No new work began on monday or any other time this past week. And the photos trump tweeted were misleading. They showed work that's been going on for more than a month on a small border wall replacement project in calexico, california, that has nothing to do with the federal budget he signed into law last week. The calexico project that began feb. 21 to replace",
            "While we are on the subject, it is reported that the u.s. Post office will lose $ 1.50 on average for each package it delivers for amazon. That amounts to billions of dollars. The failing n.y. Times reports that \"the size of the company's lobbying staff has ballooned, \" and that..."

White house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders confirmed thursday night that the federal government will stop \" cost-sharing reduction \" payments to health insurers, which help millions of people afford insurance they get through obamacare's exchanges, politico reports. Sanders called the payments a \" bailout of insurance companies \" and \" another example of how the previous administration abused taxpayer dollars and skirted the law to prop up a broken system. \" related coverage: the impact: the washington post likens the decision to \" throwing a bomb into the marketplaces \" created by obamacare. Insurers have said this is the strongest step trump could take to undermine the law, because rising costs would force them to bail without the promise of getting reimbursed. The alternative could be to remain, but to raise premiums to levels most couldn't afford. The new york times also calls the subsidies \" essential \" to the affordable care act. Trump's possible offer: \" the democrats obamacare is imploding, \" the president tweeted friday morning. \" massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix! \" the last part might be the most telling. The wall street journal reports that trump has told at least one lawmaker that he's open to preserving the payments if a bipartisan deal is struck on health care. All eyes on this: trump is referring to a deal being negotiated by gop sen. Lamar alexander and democratic sen. Patty murray. Under the broad strokes, the subsidies would be continued, a win for democrats, but states would get more flexibility to avoid obamacare rules, a win for republicans, per the journal. Big deadline: open enrollment for the obamacare exchanges begins in less than three weeks, raising pressure for a quick resolution. Background: a federal court declared the subsidies illegal last year, though the decision is being appealed. The subsidies add up to around $ 7 billion this year, a figure expected to steadily rise in coming years. The attorneys general of california and new york vowed thursday night that they would challenge the latest move in court, while nancy pelosi and chuck schumer called it \" a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of america. \" second move: earlier thursday, trump signed an executive order that's expected to undermine obamacare in a different way.",

Filed the paperwork earlier this week. That would indicate it could go public within the first three months of next year. Uber declined to comment on the journal report. Uber's advisers have suggested the company could get a valuation of $ 120 billion; its latest valuation was $ 76 billion when it sold about a $ 500 million stake to toyota in august. The filing would come on the heels of a similar move by uber's smaller rival lyft. The two initial public offerings could raise billions for the two companies to fuel their expansions, while giving investors their first chance to buy stakes in the ride-hailing phenomenon.

But just how bad a loss is this? the defeat is \" the most surreal and embarrassing night in us soccer history, \" writes grant wahl for sports illustrated. \" unthinkable, \" declares the new york times. \" with that loss, the usmnt gave a nation the lowest point in its sporting history, and it's not really close, \" writes andrew joseph for usa today. \" it took 90-plus minutes for united states soccer to regress 30 years, \" writes frank isola at the daily news. The kicker is that two other games fell the wrong way in unexpected fashion, one on a \" phantom goal, \" sealing the us fate. Honduras rallied from two goals down to beat mexico, and panama rallied from one goal back to beat costa rica. Had either of those games gone the other way, or had the us even tied trinidad and tobago ( which had previously been eliminated from qualifying ), the americans would have secured a spot in russia for the 2018 competition. Of note: phantom goal: the winning goal scored by panama against costa rica didn't cross the goal line, per cbs sports, which has video here. The story raises the faint hope that the us could appeal the goal ruling, but it seems unlikely. \" as far as i know, there is no recourse, \" says a us soccer official. Pity fox sports: the network paid $ 200 million, outbidding espn, for the rights to televise the 2018 world cup and showcase teen phenom christian pulisic, notes business insider.

        "summary": "Sometimes paradise is better off lost: off the coast of india in the bay of bengal, a manhattan-size island called north sentinel island boasts a deep green canopy of trees, stretches of sandy beaches, coral reef barriers — and a population that's decidedly hostile to outsiders, who aren't likely to live long. As wackulus explains, the isolated indigenous tribe, one of the last of its kind on earth, almost always attacks visitors. A little digging uncovered this story: after a night of drinking in 2006, two fishermen drifted too close to the island and were killed by the sentinelese, who've lived there for 60,000 years. A helicopter sent to recover their bodies was halted by tribesmen's arrows, the telegraph reported at the time; the air generated by the copter's rotors revealed their bodies in shallow graves. One of the earliest known encounters a century earlier ended when a convict who'd escaped from the neighboring andaman islands ended up on the island with his throat slit, the new york times reported in 2012. In 1967, the sentinelese — a stone age people but for the metal-tipped arrows carved from wrecked ships — hid from an indian government expedition, during which a marker was placed on the island, declaring it part of india. Indian anthropologist tn pandit's visits in the late 1980s and early 1990s proved more exciting. He left gifts of coconuts, knives, cloth, mirrors, and once a live pig. The native hunter-gatherers — believed to number between 50 and 400 — killed the pig and buried it in the sand, but only insulted pandit's group. \" they would turn their backs to us and sit on their haunches as if to defecate, \" he told the independent. India has since established a 3-mile exclusion zone around the island to protect both outsiders and the natives from disease. Survival international argues it's all for the best as the natives are \" extremely healthy, alert, and thriving. \" they have fire and are believed to dine on fish, fruits, tubers, wild pigs, lizards, and honey. ( this video reportedly shows the first contact with an isolated tribe. )",

The documents also reveal that us officials fear that even as pakistan collects some $ 1 billion in us aid to combat militants members of its intelligence community secretly meet with the taliban to help organize networks of militants to fight american soldiers, reports the times. National security adviser james jones blasted wikileaks'disclosure of classified information — one of the biggest leaks in us military history — saying it endangers the lives of american servicemen and threatens us security.

Saudi billionaire prince al-waleed bin talal walked out of prison saturday after being arrested on corruption charges as part of a sweeping roundup in november, reports reuters. More precisely, he walked out of the riyadh ritz-carlton, which has been turned into a prison of sorts for saudi elite accused of wrongdoing. Prior to his release, saudi authorities were reportedly seeking a financial settlement of $ 6 billion — yes, billion — from al-waleed, though it is unclear what, if any, amount he paid, reports the wall street journal. Neither the prince nor saudi authorities have provided details about his release, including whether he has been cleared of wrongdoing. The corruption crackdown set in place by crown prince mohammed bin salman is widely regarded as more of a bid on his part to consolidate power as he institutes wide-ranging reform throughout the country.

Diehl, vf's fashion and style director, says she found her job \" completely petrifying, \" partially because in depicting jenner, diehl wanted to nail \" how she sees herself, \" she explains. And then there was the secrecy: only about 10 people at the magazine knew jenner was being photographed; diehl told the rest of the team barbra streisand was the subject of the shoot. And, because of the need for secrecy, diehl had to buy rather than borrow some of the clothing for jenner to wear — a challenge for a 6-foot-2-inch cover model. One dress was sourced traditionally from zac posen, and the designer didn't realize he was going to be part of such a \" historic moment, \" as he later called it, until he saw the magazine monday morning.

But, as the ap reports, caitlyn does acknowledge in the full vf interview that she at least considered the \" k \" spelling before deciding to break the tradition. Jenner's mom is having a hard time adjusting to all the changes: caitlyn is \" beautiful \" and \" so much more at ease, \" esther jenner tells access hollywood, but \" i still have to call him bruce.

        "summary": "Fresh off winning a rotating seat on the 15-member un security council, saudi arabia has made the unexpected move of refusing it, citing the body's poor response to unrest in the middle east, specifically in syria. In a statement reported by the new york times, the saudi foreign ministry argues \" the method and work mechanism and the double standards in the security council prevent it from properly shouldering its responsibilities toward world peace, \" noting the country will only take its place once reforms have been made to boost the body's role in fostering that peace. It didn't give specifics. Though the times suggests that saudi arabia is frustrated that permanent members russia and china have stymied some of the west's efforts regarding syria ( efforts the country supports ), reuters reports that much of the country's anger is directed at the us. It specifies that saudi arabia views american policies regarding the arab spring as damaging relations between the two countries; washington's softening toward iran's new president, hasan rouhani, hasn't sat well with the country, either. The times calls it a \" surprising \" move, noting that it was the first time saudi arabia has gone after a security council seat, which many saw as an indication that it wanted to have a bigger hand in what's happening in syria.",

        "summary": "A brief, planned ceasefire failed to materialize in gaza today, as death continued to rain down on the strip. Israel had offered to hold its offensive to accommodate a visit from egyptian prime minister hesham kandil, provided hamas held its fire as well. But hamas said it would keep firing, and one israeli defense minister complained that 50 rockets had flown in from gaza during kandil's visit, cnn reports. A hamas-run tv station reported that israel had kept firing as well, but israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into israel. But hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near tel aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded ( the last time they did so was during the gulf war ) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \" there will be a price for that escalation, \" ehud barak vowed, according to the new york times. Israel has now hit 250 gaza targets, while taking further steps toward a ground invasion, calling up 16,000 reservists, the wall street journal reports. It's also steadily sending troops and armored vehicles to the border, notes cnn — between 1,500 and 2,000 are already there, one official said. Israel claims the attacks have weakened hamas ' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new egyptian regime would be more active in helping the palestinians. \" the time has changed, \" he said. \" no longer the israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the palestinians without being held responsible. That time is far bygone. \" for its part, the obama administration says it's seeking help from arab countries in calling on hamas to relent. \" the onus rests squarely on hamas... To stop its rocket attacks, \" says a state department spokesman. Un secretary-general ban ki-moon is planning diplomatic visits to jerusalem, ramallah, and cairo within days.",

        "summary": "A nuclear accident happened somewhere in russia or kazakhstan during the last week of september and was kept very quiet, the french nuclear safety institute irsn has concluded after analyzing a mysterious radioactive cloud that appeared over europe last month. Irsn researchers say they detected high levels of ruthenium 106, a type of atom that does not occur in nature and is only found when atoms are split in reactors, reuters reports. The cloud was at its peak during the first week in october and dissipated until it could not be detected in france by oct. 13, according to irsn, which says its analysis of weather patterns points to a source between the ural mountains and the volga river. The institute, which says other european nuclear regulators have made similar findings, has ruled out the crash of a radioactive satellite or an accident at a nuclear reactor as the source of the cloud. It says the most likely source was either a facility dealing with spent nuclear fuel or a facility for radioactive medicine. Russian authorities say they're not aware of any accident in the area, while kazakh authorities haven't been reached for comment yet, irsn says. The institute says the cloud itself is harmless and is unlikely to contaminate food, though it says there must have been a very large amount of ruthenium 106 released at the accident site, enough that would have theoretically warranted an evacuation of a radius of several miles.",

According to the soylent blog, three flavors will be available at the 7-eleven locations: cacao, cafe coffiest, and cafe chai. No word yet on whether the products will expand to more stores, but soylent ceo rob rhinehart has hinted that this is the first step in offering their products more broadly: \"we are thrilled to be working alongside the talented 7-eleven team and look forward to building our retail presence nationwide. \" but per grub street, not all the kinks in the drinkable meal revolution have been worked out.

I didn't separate my personal life from my political activities, and i couldn't have been more wrong. \" the former illinois congressman added an unusual request: he wants to serve his time in alabama because \" i want to make it a little inconvenient for everybody to get to me. \" his wife, sandi, then got sentenced to 12 months in prison for filing false tax returns about their income, reports ap. She wept, too. \"my heart breaks every day with the pain this has caused my babies, \" she said, referring to their two children, ages 9 and 13. Because of the kids, the judge will allow the jacksons to stagger their sentences and to decide themselves who goes first, reports the sun-times.

The latter would have made her eligible for time off for good behavior. Now she must serve her full term.",

Police in germany say they have recovered more than 100 items, including diaries, glasses, and sheet music, many of which were confiscated from a berlin auction house in july, the bbc reports. Police say a 58-year-old man was arrested monday after a search of his home and cars turned up additional lennon items. Prosecutors say a second suspect, ono's former chauffeur, is living in turkey and they will try to have him extradited. Police say they became aware of the items when a bankruptcy administrator at the auctionata auction house contacted them in july, the ap reports. They are now trying to determine whether the auction house knew the items were stolen when it acquired them in 2014. The diaries are from 1975, 1979, and 1980. The final entry in the 1980 diary was made on dec. 8, hours before he was murdered, says prosecutor susann wettley. She says that when investigators flew to new york to have ono verify the items, the widow was \" very emotional and we noticed clearly how much these things mean to her and how happy she would be to have them back. \" ( an angry letter from lennon to paul mccartney was auctioned off last year. )",
