        "summary": "Democrats accuse republicans of trying to dupe hispanic voters into staying home on election day with a new ad slated to run in nevada, florida, and other states with large latino populations. The ad, by a group called latinos for reform, makes the case that president obama and democrats haven't fulfilled promises on immigration reform and that hispanics should punish them by not voting. The president of the group is conservative political consultant robert deposada, reports ben smith of politico. Democrats, including harry reid and president obama, called it a ploy to boost republican candidates. \" listen to her latest, running ads on hispanic television telling people not to vote, \" reid said of sharron angle. \" she is trying to keep people from voting. \" this afternoon, univision said it was pulling the ad and telemundo said it wouldn't air it, either, reports ap.

While some members of the press see the movie as a popcorn flick that's at least better than revenge of the fallen, others wish it would have changed into something more interesting. John anderson of the wall street journal calls it \" a black hole of technology, talent and time. Transformers: dark of the moon is a symptom of many things, chief among them the fact that summer blockbuster movies don't really matter anymore. \" slate's dana stevens sees a glimmer of a silver-plated lining. \" there is something awe-inspiring about bay's sheer commitment to scale — augmented now by that state-of-the-art anti-audience weapon, 3-d, \" stevens writes. \" but marveling at its grotesque gigantism doesn't make this two-and-a-half-hour-long movie any less dull. \" richard corliss of time is a bit more accepting. \" t3 is the movie equivalent of an ' 80s thrash-metal concert ( not megadeth but megatron ), with bits of spoken exposition inserted into the action scenes like the lead singer's mumbled comments between songs. \" tom charity of cnn might be the most realistic in his resignation. \" it's a lousy movie, but at least it's a lousy movie with a serviceable story, killer cgi and an action climax that goes on forever, \" he writes. \" an awful lot of people like that kind of thing — my kids included. \"",

When the feature began, a half hour late, the audience showed its fondness for the material by saluting each appearance of the friendly yellow car-bot bumblebee, not with rowdy shouts but with courteous applause, as if after a sharp volley at wimbledon. A few whoops greeted the 3-d imax leveling of chicago. And when the movie ended, about an hour before dawn, the admirers let out a few decorous cheers. They sounded less like red-meat fanboys than connoisseurs at a wine tasting. The critics'reaction has been more tentative. They decried the first transformers ( 2007 )"

Based on fresh evidence, an appeals court has granted a new hearing for the british businessman convicted of the 1986 killings of derrick and duane moo young in a miami hotel room, reports the ap. Maharaj, whose fingerprints were found inside the hotel room, has claimed he was framed for the murders of the father and son, who owed him $ 400,000 from a property deal, the guardian reported in january. He says the killings were actually ordered by pablo escobar after members of his medellin drug cartel caught the moo youngs embezzling laundered money, reports the bbc. Maharaj's lawyer now says six cartel associates — including one of escobar's favorite hit men, john jairo \" popeye \" velasque — claim responsibility for the murders, per the sun. However, a rep for the miami-dade state attorney's office says a judge previously \" found these witnesses and/or claims to not be credible or have any merit. \" earlier this year, maharaj's lawyer said the 78-year-old was near death, suffering from a \" flesh eating bacteria \" as a result of \" horrific \" conditions at south florida reception center, where he's serving a life sentence. Says maharaj's wife of 41 years: \" i know god will bring him home.

An apparent inside look at the tactics being used in that battle was offered up thursday by daniels ' attorney, michael avenatti, when he tweeted a photo of a cd or dvd with the caption: \" if a picture is worth a thousand words, how many words is this worth???? #60minutes #pleasedenyit #basta. \" the attorney told cnn it was \" a warning shot \" at trump and his supporters. Trump has denied the affair ever took place while also claiming that daniels has violated the nda multiple times and could owe some $ 20 million. Trump attorneys are trying to get the case moved into federal court. Daniels'reps argue the nda was never valid to begin with because trump never signed it.",

According to a case study published last month in the journal of emergency medicine, a 21-year-old man who was a regular pot user suffered a heart attack — and doctors identified cannabis \" as the most significant precipitant of his acute coronary syndrome, \" livescience reports. It's not the first time marijuana has been tied to heart problems. Reportedly, the first documented link between the two was shown in 2000, when a boston study indicated that a middle-aged person's risk of having a heart attack rose five times in the first hour after lighting up, the new york times reported that year. And earlier this year, a french study cited by livescience noted that of 2,000 reported marijuana complications, 2 % of them were heart issues ( including nine people who died ). But a cause-and-effect relationship has yet to be established: even in the recent case study, researchers admit the man's high cholesterol and cigarette smoking may have also played a role in causing his heart attack. But a cardiologist at nyu's langone medical center tells livescience that \" the case report adds to the growing body of evidence about the potential deleterious effects of marijuana use on the heart. \" ( pot was recently implicated in the deaths of two young men who died of complications from heart arrhythmias. )",

He went back and fired again, authorities said, killing hernandez.

A controversy erupted on social media this month after cosmopolitan picked up on a nasa post aimed at kids about how the signs of the zodiac came to be, reports the christian science monitor. Because the sky has changed over the eons, the constellations no longer line up as the ancient babylonians first mapped them 3,000 years ago, explained nasa. That means the astrological signs are now about a month off — theoretically ruining tattoos across the globe — and that \" a whopping 86 % of us now have a different sign, \" wrote charlotte warwick in cosmo. ( her post provides the new dates. ) what's more, the space agency noted a 13th star sign at the end of the calendar: ophiuchus ( tucked between scorpio and sagittarius ). Ok, so what does that mean for those who faithfully follow their horoscope? nothing, says nasa, because astrology is fake. \" astronomy is not astrology, \" the space agency writes on tumblr. \" we didn't change any zodiac signs, we just did the math. \" tell that to hot-headed scorpios ( now nov. 23-nov. 29 ) who have been told they are gentle-souled libras ( oct. 20-nov. 23 ). Or to those under the new impossible-to-pronounce sign ophiuchus ( nov. 29-dec. 17 ). \" your new talents include architecture and snake-bearing, \" writes ben guarino in the washington post. He explains that the babylonians ditched the 13th constellation, unable to fit them all into 12 months. At least there's some good news for those under ophiuchus: serpents make very cool tats.

He said he's gonna kill me.

Whitmer's wife told police that zimmerman said, \" hey, i like your racist tattoos, \" and another witness who was at the table says he asked zimmerman to go away after he started boasting about the martin killing. A friend of zimmerman's told police a different story, saying they had been eating when five men approached them and started yelling at them.

But, in the wake of a sun-sentinel op-ed by the parents of one sandy hook victim — who claim tracy has been harassing them — fau gave tracy a letter wednesday saying he's been recommended for termination, the sun-sentinel reports. Tracy has discussed victim noah pozner numerous times on his blog, and the feud apparently has to do with the pozners filing a copyright infringement claim against him for publishing noah's image on the blog. In the op-ed, veronique and lenny pozner say that tracy has \" publicly demoniz[ ed ] our attempts to keep cherished photos of our slain son from falling into the hands of conspiracy theorists \" and \" sent us a certified letter demanding proof that noah once lived, that we were his parents, and that we were the rightful owner of his photographic image, \" after which they filed a police report for harassment. They called on fau to do something about tracy. He responded on a \" sandy hook hoax \" facebook page, claiming that the pozners and other \" alleged parents \" of victims \" have made out very well financially, soliciting contributions from generous yet misinformed americans. \" he can respond to his termination recommendation within 10 days, \" after which final action may be taken, \" per a university statement.

Children are, on average, 15 % less fit than their parents were, and the decline is seen for both boys and girls and for all ages between 9 and 17, the ap notes. Fitness has been dropping by around 5 % a decade, the study found, and while the decline is slowly leveling off in europe and north america, fitness is still going downhill fast in china and other parts of east asia. Researchers say obesity and sedentary lifestyles are probably playing the biggest role in the fall in fitness — and they warn that unfit young people will be unhealthier later in life.

On average, children today run a mile 90 seconds slower than did their counterparts 30 years ago, they said. If a young person is generally unfit now, then they are more likely to develop conditions like heart disease later in life lead researcher dr grant tomkinson, university of south australia bbc - health bmi calculator obesity across nations, cardiovascular endurance - gauged by how far children can run in a set time - has dwindled consistently by about 5 % every decade, according to the findings. The decline is seen in boys and girls and across all ages from nine to 17 years, and is linked to obesity, with some countries faring worse than others. Lead researcher dr grant tomkinson of the university of south australia's school of health sciences said: \" in fact, about 30 % to 60 % of the declines in endurance running performance can be explained by increases in",

We have kids that are less active than before, \" said dr. Stephen daniels, a university of colorado pediatrician and spokesman for the heart association.

The affected ingredients are all designed to be used with water and then rinsed off — meaning hand sanitizers and wipes are still good to go for now, as are products used in health care settings. The fda had been looking into antibacterials hard-core since at least december 2013, when it announced that consumer groups and scientific studies had raised major red flags about the ingredients ' effectiveness and safety, with some being linked to hormonal issues and bacterial resistance. But concerns about triclosan have dated back to the late ' 70s, and even the cdc says soap doesn't need an antibacterial boost, nbc notes.

The loot has been valued at about $ 330,000, but the anonymous climber handed it over to police upon his descent from mont blanc, reports the guardian. Authorities speculate the jewels belonged to a passenger aboard one of two air india flights that crashed decades ago — one in 1950 and the other in 1966. They will now try to figure out who that was so they can give the treasure to relatives. The climber found the box, labeled \" made in india, \" while scaling one of the mountain's glaciers. \" he saw very well that what he had in his hands was something very valuable, realizing straight away that it was precious stones that had been very carefully wrapped, \" says a local police official. \" maybe he didn't want to keep something that had belonged to someone who died. \" if police can't trace the original owner, the jewels could go back to the french climber, reports afp.

According to a metro police, kelsey mcmurtry, 24, was auditioning at deja vu showgirls on demonbreun street and left her young daughter in the back of a car with the windows rolled up around 4 p.m. Mcmurtry's 19-year-old friend, summer taylor, was supposed to have been watching the child, but instead, was inside the club watching mcmurtry's audition, according to an arrest warrant. Officers were called to the scene after witnesses reported seeing the child in the car. Taylor allegedly told police she had been coming back to check on the child but witnesses reported never seeing the woman leave the club. Witnesses estimated the child had been in the car for about 30 minutes. The arresting officer noted in the warrant it was 72 degrees outside and the temperature inside the car was likely over 100 degrees. The little girl was reportedly wearing a heavy coat and drenched in sweat when she was removed from the car. She was taken to a local hospital for treatment. The department of children's services were called to the scene and hospital to care for the child. Mcmurtry and taylor were both booked"

The nation's ruler, sheik mohammed bin rashid al-maktoum, says his planned mall of the world will, at 8 million square feet, be twice as large as minnesota's mall of america, and include a theme park covered in the summer, 100 hotels and apartments, and yes, an entire street network that is climate-controlled.

Dubai is expecting a surge in visitors when it hosts the world expo in 2020, reports al jazeera, which authorities say will cost $ 8.4 billion to organize but generate $ 23 billion. The mall should accommodate 180 million visitors a year — more than four times the current record-holder, the las vegas strip, which pulls in 40 million visitors a year. The project is the world's first \"temperature-controlled ( pedestrian ) city, \" covering 48 million square feet, according to gulf news.

Insiders tell the washington post that gop bigwigs gathered monday and discussed the possibility of a brokered convention in cleveland in july. The party hasn't entered a convention without a clear nominee since 1976, when gerald ford narrowly defeated conservative insurgent ronald reagan on the first ballot. The post's sources say the gop leaders discussed strategies in case there is no clear nominee this time around and no winner on the first ballot, allowing delegates to shift allegiances in what reuters reports would be the first brokered gop convention since thomas dewey was nominated in 1948. A source tells the post that some gop strategists argued for a strategy to make sure there was a clear alternative to donald trump in the event of a brokered convention, though another official present at the meeting tells reuters that trump wasn't the focus of the discussion. \" it was more logistical in nature, not strategic, \" he says. \" it was more like ' are you planning for a hurricane? ' \" a former mitt romney adviser agrees that with the field still crowded, talk of a brokered convention goes beyond trump. \" what you're seeing is the party bracing for a potential hunger games scenario where you have a different person win each of the first four primaries and they all have the resources to slug it out until the convention, \" he tells the post.",

Meanwhile, her family, us politicians, and even her doctor are trying to get her out of a possible years-long prison sentence — for carrying a drug that's one of america's most widely prescribed, npr reports. Trouble is, japan's drug laws are among the world's toughest. The country routinely announces busts of amphetamines, which yakuza crime syndicates smuggle into japan for those who pull long hours, like white-collar workers, students, and truck drivers. Another problem: russell's mom sent her the prescription in an old tylenol bottle, which created the appearance of smuggling. She says she did it to ward off thieves and avoid identifying russell's illness — attention deficit disorder — in a country where mental illness is stigmatized. But warnings against taking adderall to japan do exist online, and so far japanese authorities haven't budged. \" she made a mistake, \" her stepfather wrote japanese prosecutors. \" carrie has been humiliated and punished enough for that mistake, which she will never make again. \" ( a tourist was once jailed in dubai after reporting a rape. )",

Instead, traders and start-up entrepreneurs looking to work hard rather than party hard are increasingly turning to a modafinil — a \" smart drug \" said to have inspired the film limitless, in which a writer pops a pill that allows him to tap into 100 % of his brain capacity. The drug is intended to treat narcolepsy, but time-poor traders use it to stay awake and hyper-alert for long periods of work, reports new york. \" i would describe it as being very much like adderall, but without the speediness, \" says peter borden, a former user. Prescriptions for modafinil in the us have increased almost tenfold over the past decade, mostly for off-label use, according to a study published in internal medicine. It was originally believed to be non-addictive, but a 2009 study found that may not be the case. Borden says that for him, withdrawals were so bad he had to quit the drug: \" it was sort of like being thrust into dirty, messy reality, as opposed to a clean, neatly organized place.

But the \" operation gunnerside \" raid in world war ii on a norwegian plant making heavy water — a hydrogen-filled substance that could eventually have been used by germany to make atomic bombs — was a successful one, led by 23-year-old joachim roenneberg, the youngest member of the five-man operation. The plant was blown up that day in february 1943, becoming what norway prime minister erna solberg calls \" the most successful sabotage campaign on norwegian soil during the war, \" per the new york post. Tributes are once more being paid to roenneberg as norwegian officials on sunday announced his death at age 99, reuters reports. The raid on the norsk hydro plant, which was surrounded by guards, is one of legend that's since been the subject of books, movies, and a tv series. The team put together by a british espionage and sabotage agency parachuted onto a mountain near the plant, joined up with some commandos, skied their way to their target, and broke into the plant, where they blew up the heavy-water production line. Making the raid especially notable was that not a single gunshot was fired; in a 2014 documentary, roenneberg said the attack went off \" like a dream, \" per the ap. The team then fled on their skis, with roenneberg escaping over the border to neutral sweden. \" he was one of our top insurgents during the war, \" solberg posted on facebook, adding to the ntb news agency, via reuters: \" he is one of our great heroes. \" ( a soviet officer may have saved the world from nuclear war. )",

The allegations: state investigators are looking into claims that the absentee ballots were tampered with or simply not turned in.

As the telegraph puts it, bir tawil is \" the only place on earth where humans can live and survive that is not part of any state or country. \" dixit decided to do something about that. In a facebook post, he says he drove six hours and braved the egyptian military, which has \"'shoot at sight ' orders \" due to terrorists in the area, to establish his new kingdom. Dixit brought a flag of his own design and planted sunflower seeds in bir tawil. \"following the early civilization ethics and rules, if you want to claim a land then you need to grow crops on it, \" he says. \" i have added a seed and poured some water on it today. It is mine. \" while dixit insists it's \" no joke, i own a country now \" and hundreds of people have signed his petition to the un seeking recognition, the kingdom of dixit is likely to remain unofficial. In 2014, a legal expert at georgetown university told the washington post that \" under international law, only states can assert sovereignty over territory. \" that was the same year a father from virginia tried to claim bir tawil for himself and make his daughter princess of the \" kingdom of north sudan. \" ( this famous person became the first citizen of the \" trash isles. \" )",

But friends of marques gaines say they're baffled by reports of their incredibly calm friend ever fighting anyone. The trouble began around 4: 20 a.m. Sunday in the 400 block of north state street, where two men were arguing on the sidewalk, police said. One of the men, later identified as gaines, was punched in the face and knocked into the street. The person who hit him fled, police said, and the driver of a passing sedan didn't see the unconscious gaines lying in the street. He was hit and rushed to northwestern memorial hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, police said. Loop north news reported that gaines was hit by a cab. The driver did stay on the scene and was not ticketed, police said. Gaines grew up in near atlanta and attended northern michigan university, according to rachel hogan, one of his friends from georgia. \" he was effervescent, \" hogan said. \" i was really selfish with my time"

In the weirdest kind of deja vu, seismologists with the pacific northwest seismic network say they believe saturday's fan-generated quake was bigger than that of 2011, whose energy a nearby seismometer registered in line with a 1- or 2-magnitude quake at the time. \" this signal looks bigger than the one three years ago, \" the pnsn's director tells the seattle times, but it ' ll be a few days before the network knows for sure. But the pnsn was ready for this one: mynorthwest.com reports it installed two seismometers in centurylink field ( one of the nfl's loudest stadiums, per the times ) in advance of the game, one on the field and one in the stands.

Sources tell abc that trump has done a lot more prep for this debate than the first two, spending much of sunday and monday working with top aides and advisers including chris christie, who was trump's sparring partner during a rapid-fire question session. With both candidates trying to land knockout blows after two ugly debates, analysts are not expecting the evening to be dominated by dry discussions of fiscal policy. \" the first two debates were just warm-ups for what might be the most raucous and wild debate in american history, \" jake thompson, an associate professor and debate coach at the university of nevada, las vegas, where the 90-minute debate will be held, tells the las vegas review-journal. The hill lists five things to watch out for in the debate, including whether the candidates shake hands, whether trump has any wild cards left to play — and whether clinton will play it safe or \" go for the kill. \" the new york times looks at how the debate is also a huge night for fox news in the wake of a troubled year.

She says the problem with earlier studies is that they looked only at a few gestures, mostly just sticking out the tongue and opening the mouth. \" if infants also increase their tongue protrusions when an adult models a happy face or finger pointing, then it's not a case of imitation, but probably excitement at seeing an adult do something interesting, \" slaughter says. \" we eliminated this problem by assessing infants'responses to a wide range of different models. \" the new study, published thursday, tested 11 gestures on 106 infants between 1 and 9 weeks old.

        "summary": "After two young people lost their left arms in an extremely rare pair of shark attacks on sunday, there were atvs patrolling the beach, and helicopters and boats searching the waters off oak island, nc, yesterday — but no lifeguards. Town officials say they ' ll keep looking for sharks, but they have neither the ability nor the authority to keep people out of the water, despite recommendations from shark experts. More: the town's fire chief says the beach stayed open because \" there's no way for us to control \" sharks near the shore. \" we have 9 miles of beach and more entry points [ than ] we can man, \" he tells the charlotte observer. \" what we can do is just advise beach-goers to be careful if they do enter the water. We can't stop them from entering. \" the town's manager says there's no money for lifeguards, and it's not clear whether they would have made a difference. University of florida shark expert george burgess, however, tells the guardian that officials \" should consider closing the beach \" for at least a couple of days, getting extra lifeguards in the area, \" and teaching people that to enter the ocean is to enter a wilderness. Burgess adds that while it was probably the same shark in both attacks, the chances of identifying it are \" slim to none \" and it could be 40 miles away by now. The town's manager tells the los angeles times that if any sharks are seen displaying \" aggressive \" behavior — like coming within 100 feet of the shore — they may be killed, though shark experts say this is a \" foolhardy \" approach that didn't reduce shark attacks when it was tried in australia. Both victims, a 12-year-old girl whose age was initially reported as 13 and a 16-year-old boy, are now in fair condition, reports the ap, which notes that they were both swimming around 20 yards offshore in waist-deep water — and authorities didn't warn beachgoers until after the first attack. If the girl had been attacked at another part of the beach, she might not have survived, according to another charlotte observer story. After the bite, the girl was taken onto the beach just yards away from the rental cottage of marie hildreth, an experienced charlotte paramedic who ran to help and was able to stanch the bleeding with a rope cut from a surfing bodyboard. And there was more help at hand: hildreth was on vacation with relatives, including her fire captain husband, her police officer brother-in-law, her firefighter brother, and her",

        "summary": "What yahya abu hassan has described as the \" best day of his life \" involved sneaking his emaciated, pregnant wife and three sick young kids through a barbed-wire fence over the syrian border to turkey, where he didn't even say goodbye before they were whisked to safety. That day in september 2013 was the day hassan ditched his family to devote himself to helping isis set up a caliphate, his story told in a preview for a longer article by graeme wood appearing in the atlantic's next issue. Wood details hassan's reputation as one of the most revered \" teachers \" among jihadist circles, known for his \" staggering mastery of islamic law and classical arabic language and literature, \" as well as his fluency in english. When wood first heard about hassan in 2014 while researching a previous atlantic article about isis, he was curious about his origin story and started poking around. First he found links to hassan and his extreme views, but further detective work involving nomenclature and google searches led to an astonishing discovery: a doj release about the 2006 conviction of data technician john georgelas, who used to live in texas not far from wood, and who wood determined was hassan. What wood found out next about the greek-american is fascinating. An in-person conversation wood had with georgelas ' father, tim, about john — who tim describes as once an easily swayed \" follower \" who experimented with psychedelic drugs — is especially revealing, as is wood's scrutiny of georgelas'relationship with his ex-wife, once a fellow jihadist. Most chilling is georgelas ' current isis role, in which it's speculated he may now hold the second most-powerful position. \" he knows how to speak to americans, how to scare them, how to recruit them — how to make the islamic state's war theirs, \" wood writes.

            "The islamic state is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs, among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Here's what that means for its strategy — and for how to stop it. What is the islamic state? where did it come from, and what are its intentions? the simplicity of these questions can be deceiving, and few western leaders seem to know the answers. In december, the new york times published confidential comments by major general michael k. Nagata, the special operations commander for the united states in the middle east, admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the islamic state's appeal. \"we have not defeated the idea, \" he said. \"we do not even understand the idea. \" in the past year, president obama has referred to the islamic state, variously, as \"not islamic \" and as al-qaeda's \"jayvee team, \" statements that reflected confusion about the group, and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

        "summary": "The piece of plane wing confirmed to be from mh370 has company. In addition to a suitcase, malaysia's transportation minister says \" many items, \" including seat cushions, aluminum foil, and a window, have washed up on reunion island in the indian ocean, but experts have yet to prove the items are from the vanished jet, reports deutsche welle. \" i can only ascertain that it's plane debris, \" he says. Malaysia yesterday confirmed the wing part, or flaperon, belonged to mh370 based on its paint color and a seal matching a maintenance record, reports reuters. French experts who are continuing to study the flaperon, however, say there is simply a \" very strong supposition \" that it came from mh370. Malaysia has now asked neighboring areas, including mauritius and madagascar, to search for potential debris. Rather than bring closure, the find has incensed some chinese relatives of those on board the boeing 777 who streamed to the beijing headquarters of malaysia airlines today, the guardian reports. One woman says prime minister najib razak, who broke the news, was speaking \" nonsense. I just want to kill him. \" \" i don't believe it, \" says another, adding 515 days is \" enough time for them to have produced fake debris. \" the australian agency leading the search for mh370 says it will continue to focus on 46,000 square miles of seabed west of australia, noting the debris is consistent with a crash site in that area. What's next for the flaperon? investigators will likely analyze thin pieces under a microscope to see how it was broken, then \" open it up to see if there's any internal damage, \" an expert says. The study could take \" a month or months. \"",

Yukiya amano, the director general of the watchdog group, and the head of the iaea's department of safeguards were on site to check out the unidentified building, which amano says was devoid of equipment and showed \" indications of recent renovation work, \" per the news agency. Environmental samples were also taken and sent to vienna for analysis, which the iaea notes counts as \" significant progress \" in monitoring a site whose only oversight by the iaea has been via satellite over the past decade. The group is due to offer a report on \" possible military dimensions \" of the site, long suspected of carrying out tests related to nuclear weapon detonations, by year's end. The environmental samples, however, are already controversial thanks to the iaea's confidential deal with iran that lets the country hold sway over those inspections, the news agency notes. Amano acknowledged that \" the iranian side played a part in the sample-taking process by swiping samples, \" though he told reporters at a vienna news conference today the samples ' \" authenticity \" was ensured via an \" established verification process. \" amano also said iaea monitored the sample-gathering, though a statement given by an iranian atomic energy agency rep to the irna state news agency said the samples were taken \" without iaea inspectors being present. \" at today's news conference, iaea's deputy director general explained that away, noting there was \" invasive monitoring \" via video and still cameras, as well as gps tracking and review by \" unspecified peers, \" as fox news puts it.",

        "summary": "A spokesman says a michigan judge wasn't aware of a sex offender's criminal background when he granted the man joint legal custody of a child born to a woman who said the man raped her when she was 12. Michigan supreme court spokesman john nevin told the ap on wednesday that sanilac county judge gregory ross didn't know 27-year-old christopher mirasolo had two criminal sexual conduct convictions, including one concerning the woman. Nevin says the judge put the order on hold tuesday after learning of mirasolo's criminal past. A hearing is scheduled for this month. The case started when the 21-year-old mother sought state assistance for her 8-year-old son. Ross issued an order last month granting the woman sole physical custody and mirasolo joint legal custody after dna tests showed he was the child's biological father. Mirasolo's lawyer says mirasolo never sought the order. \" i don't understand why they thought they needed to give him joint legal custody. He was my rapist, \" the mother told cbs news wednesday. \" i was receiving government assistance and they told me if i did not tell them who the father was of my child, that they would take that away from me. \" mirasolo ultimately served six and a half months on a plea deal. He went back to jail after being convicted of raping another young girl in 2010.",

The aclu of utah cites inmate complaints about \" squalid living conditions \" and inadequate meals, and the utah department of corrections confirms that the 42 inmates on friday handed over a letter containing six demands, reports the los angeles times. One of the demands calls for the relocation of a number of gang members within the maximum security area ( the deseret news reports that the 42 are all known gang members, per the prison ), but the aclu says the strike's true purpose is to put an end to the extreme isolation. \" these highly isolated conditions are closely akin to solitary confinement, but with the added problems inherent to spending all of one's time in the same cramped quarters with another person, \" says the aclu in a statement.

According to the chronicle of philanthropy, americans who make over $ 200,000 gave 4.6 % less of their income to charity between 2006 and 2012, and those banking under $ 100,000 gave charitable causes 4.5 % more of their income. Yet the 4.6 % less given by the wealthy still amounts to $ 4.6 billion more annually when adjusted for inflation ( perhaps evidence that the rich are getting richer? ). Using irs data, the report found that all 17 states giving the highest income percentage to charity voted for romney in the last presidential election. Utah tops the list, with a rate of 6.6 %, ahead of mississippi, alabama, tennessee, and georgia. Chronicle editor stacy palmer says church attendance plays a role in people's inclination to donate: mormons, for example, make up about 62 % of utah's population and are told to give at least 10 % to charity. \" religion has always played an important role in giving, \" palmer says, adding that secular people are also giving more in bible belt states.

That means chapman, who killed lennon in nyc on dec. 8, 1980, will have to spend at least two more years in the wende correctional facility before he's up for parole again. Per previous reports in the daily news, five people since his last parole hearing ( 2014 ) are said to have sent letters supporting his release, while two letters — including one from lennon's widow, yoko ono, who has said, \" he did it once, he could do it again \" — reportedly asked for the parole board to keep him behind bars.",

The new series, premiering on an as-yet-unannounced date in 2017, takes place 25 years after the original series, and fans of the original will be happy to know that original cast members kyle maclachlan, sherilyn fenn, david duchovny, mädchen amick, and harry dean stanton are returning and that series creator david lynch is also listed as part of the cast. The newbies include naomi watts, richard chamberlain, jim belushi, michael cera, amanda seyfried, jennifer jason leigh, ashley judd, laura dern, ernie hudson, and tom sizemore. And there are more — a lot more. As the hollywood reporter notes, the full cast list has 217 names on it. But it's missing other veteran cast members, including lara flynn boyle ( donna ), piper laurie ( catherine ), and michael ontkean ( the sheriff ). The verge notes that some of the 217 cast members listed are pretty strange ( they also include \" trent reznor, his wife mariqueen reznor, eddie vedder, jim belushi, monica bellucci, robert forster, and pretty much every random person you could possibly think of \" ) and that many of them have played roles in other lynch projects: \" is there a multi-layered david lynch metaverse in play? \" principal photography on the series has wrapped.",

The flight was all about offering a spectacular show to journalists and potential buyers, and the captain of the sukhoi superjet-100, despite his inexperience, appears to have attempted a foolhardy move before crashing into the side of a mountain, experts say. Steep mountain ridges and chaotic air circulation patterns make the area tricky even for local pilots, but the sukhoi pilot \" had absolutely no experience with the area's unique topographical traits, \" a flight safety expert says. Authorities say they were surprised by the pilot's request to approach mount salak, which has been the site of seven other plane crashes over the last decade. The crash has put the spotlight on manufacturer demonstration flights, dubbed \" joy flights \" for their informal atmosphere, notes ap. \" the purpose of these flights, obviously, is to show off the aircraft to potential customers, \" says an aviation expert who has gone on many such trips. \" if they are flying over a landmark, they might circle around it so the passengers can get a better look. They might fly a little lower or show the rate of climb of the aircraft. \" all 45 people on the sukhoi flight are presumed dead, and investigators will know more about the cause of the crash when its black box is recovered.",

Bbc correspondent anthony zurcher says it could become the \" 1804 dollar \" of commemorative coins, referring to extremely rare and valuable coins that were used as american diplomatic gifts in the 19th century. The white house says the issuing of the coin by the whca, a military detachment tasked with securing presidential communications, was a routine event and it was not involved. Another coin, with silhouettes of trump, kim, and south korea's president moon jae-in, was still available from the white house gift shop on thursday, discounted from $ 24.95 to $ 19.95, but high demand apparently crashed the website. After the summit was called off, trump's critics were quick to poke fun at the whca coin, with former obama campaign strategist david axelrod quipping that they would be on ebay soon, nbc reports.
