        "summary": "A fight between brothers isn't all that uncommon. But you don't often see one arrested for felony vandalism, especially when the brothers are players for two different nfl teams. Tmz has video of the \" bizarre naked struggle \" monday night between 22-year-old buffalo bills receiver zay jones and his older brother, 25-year-old cayleb jones, a receiver for the minnesota vikings. The skirmish went down in a los angeles apartment building, where the party who was naked — zay jones — can be heard in the video yelling, \" i ' m going to fight for jesus \" before briefly scuffling with cayleb in a hallway, then running out of the frame as a woman in the background screams; tmz identifies her as cayleb's girlfriend and says it was her apartment they were near. Witnesses tell tmz zay jones eventually made his way onto a public balcony on the 30th floor and smashed his foot through a window, with cayleb having to restrain him from leaping out of the hole. In the video, the aftermath can be seen, with the walls and carpet in the vicinity splattered with blood and a woman in the background saying it looks like a \" f --- ing murder scene. \" an lapd rep confirms to the buffalo news that a man identified later as \" isaiah jones \" ( zay jones ' official name ) had smashed \" doors and windows \" at the building, and that they brought him into custody close to midnight. Per espn, jones was arrested on suspicion of felony vandalism and had his bail set at $ 20,000; he has a court date of april 11. In a statement, the bills noted they'd been informed of the situation and are \" still in the process of gathering more information. \" jones was released from custody early wednesday.",

The film, often referred to as \" the benghazi movie, \" depicts the sept. 11, 2012, raid on the us diplomatic compound in benghazi, libya, in which us ambassador chris stevens was killed. The filmmakers insist that it has no political agenda, variety reports, saying it makes no mention of hillary clinton, who was secretary of state when the events unfolded and has been criticized for her handling of the situation. However, variety notes, \" conservative media for weeks has been abuzz about how the movie may impact clinton's presidential hopes. \" and trump isn't the only candidate talking about 13 hours. During thursday's republican debate, the guardian reports, candidate ted cruz plugged the film: \" tomorrow morning a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in benghazi … and the politicians that abandoned them, \" he said. During the debate, per the register, jeb bush raised the specter of benghazi when he claimed a clinton presidency would be \" a national security mess \" as she would \" continue down the path of benghazi. \" cruz, the register reports, is leading trump in iowa by three points, according to its own polling. As for how to attend trump's free showing, good luck: the new york daily news notes that no one answered the contact number trump's co-chair tweeted out, 515-267-9191.",

Robert james campbell, 41, would have been the first u.s. Inmate executed since a botched execution in oklahoma two weeks ago. His two appeals challenged the state's plan to use a drug for which it will not reveal the source, as was the case with drugs used in oklahoma, and claims of mental impairment. \" i am happy. The lord prevailed, \" campbell said from a cell just outside the texas death chamber in huntsville. The 5th u.s.

The appeal before the 5th circuit contended campbell isn't mentally competent for execution because he has a 69 iq. Courts generally set a 70 iq as the minimum threshold. Campbell's attorneys, who went to the u.s. Supreme court with last-day appeals, filed a petition to the high court even before the 5th circuit ruled on the mental impairment issue. Campbell was set to die for killing a 20-year-old houston bank teller."

            "Huntsville, texas ( ap ) — a federal appeals court halted a convicted texas killer's scheduled execution tuesday so his attorneys can pursue appeals arguing he's mentally impaired and ineligible for the death penalty. Robert james campbell, 41, would have been the first u.s. Inmate executed since a botched execution in oklahoma two weeks ago. His two appeals challenged the state's plan to use a drug for which it will not reveal the source, as was the case with drugs used in oklahoma, and claims of mental impairment. \" i am happy. The lord prevailed, \" campbell said from a cell just outside the texas death chamber in huntsville. The 5th u.s. Circuit court of appeals halted his punishment about 2½ hours before he could have been taken to the death chamber, saying campbell and his lawyers haven't had a fair opportunity to develop the mental impairment claims. The appeal before the 5th circuit contended campbell isn't mentally competent for execution because he has a 69 iq. Courts generally set a 70 iq as the minimum threshold. Campbell's attorneys, who went to the u.s. Supreme court with last-day appeals, filed a petition to the high court even before the 5th circuit ruled on the mental impairment issue. Campbell was set to die for killing a 20-year-old houston bank teller."

            "And here's a weird one. In austria, a man named niko alm has gotten a license he first applied for three years ago. Why did it take so long? well, alm asked to be photographed wearing a pasta strainer on his head. The reason? his religion requires it. Well, his anti-religion religion. Alm is a pastafarian, which is a member of the church of the flying spaghetti monster. Sound ridiculous? it's meant to be. Besides, as a pastafarian would point out, your magic space man isn't so realistic either. The church has its origins in a letter written in 2005 by bobby henderson, a 24-year-old who wrote an open letter to the kansas state board of education regarding their plans to begin teaching intelligent design in addition to the \"theory \" of evolution.

Niko alm first applied for the licence three years ago after reading that headgear was allowed in official pictures only for confessional reasons. Mr alm said the sieve was a requirement of his religion, pastafarianism. Later a police spokesman explained that the licence was issued because mr alm's face was fully visible in the photo. \" the photo was not approved on religious grounds. The only criterion for photos in driving licence applications is that the whole face must be visible, \" said manfred reinthaler, a police spokesman in vienna. He was speaking on wednesday, after austrian media had first reported mr alm's reason for wearing the pasta strainer. After receiving his application the austrian authorities had required him to obtain a doctor's certificate that he was \" psychologically fit \" to drive.

The flameless cremation uses an alkaline solution of potash, salt, and water to quickly dissolve human bodies in a pressurized vessel — doing the work of 15 to 20 years in the ground in less than two hours, the cbc reports in a story about an ontario, canada, firm that recently got the go-ahead to use the method, which came from the us several years ago. Flameless-cremation boosters point to the fact that standard cremations use up fuel, take up to four hours, and spew some 550 pounds of carbon dioxide into the air. Once the chemical solution has done its job, per the cbc, the \" leftover coffee-colored effluents \" are just flushed into the sewer system. The utilities superintendent in smith falls, ontario, where aquagreen dispositions is operating, says that's \" nothing to be concerned about. \" however, he's taking a wait-and-see approach: \" it could be a problem. I don't know how many bodies they'd have to do in a day for that to be a problem. \" dale hilton, who owns the business, says he's performed some 200 flameless cremations. The remaining bones are ground up and given to the deceased's family. \" i think this is the way of the future, \" he says. In 2011, the anderson-mcqueen funeral home in st. Petersburg, fla., became the first funeral home in the us to offer flameless cremation, the tampa bay times reports. \" it's not going to be a process for everyone — just like flame cremation, \" proprietor john t. Mcqueen said at the time. \" i can give you a long list of people who will say, ' hey, i don't want to be burned up. ' \" ( a lot of people opt for traditional cremation in these states. )",

In fact, the lead researcher tells io9, the study suggests that if other civilizations aren't taking over whole galaxies, the milky way is still a very good place to keep looking for them.

Lewandowski didn't have much of an answer: he suggested that the campaign leak word of trump's vp pick ahead of the convention. \" and with that, lewandowski was out, \" writes sherman. Trump, \" shocked \" that lewandowski didn't have a grand strategy to ease his children's concerns, had security escort him from the building soon after the meeting. The new york piece and another at cnn suggest that trump's daughter, ivanka, played a large role in the decision to oust lewandowski. Both cite rumors that he had tried to plant negative stories in the press about ivanka's husband, jared kushner, who has an influential role in the campaign. Lewandowski, however, was putting a happier public face on the split, telling cnn that he has a \" great relationship with the family \" and was unsure about why he was fired. On fox news later, trump himself praised lewandowski as a friend who \" did a great job, \" adding that \" it's time now for a different kind of campaign, \" reports politico.",

        "summary": "Mass shootings really are on the rise, according to a new fbi report. There has been an average of nearly one mass shooting a month in america this century and the rate has risen dramatically in recent years, the report released yesterday says. The agency says it identified a total of 160 \" active shooter \" incidents — defined as \" an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area \" — since 2000, and found most happened in a matter of minutes, and around two-thirds of them were over before police arrived, reports the wall street journal. There were an average of 6.4 mass shootings a year between 2000 and 2006, not including gang violence and domestic incidents, but the rate soared to an average of 16.4 a year between 2007 and 2013, according to the report, which the fbi says aims to help law enforcement agencies \" prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from these incidents. \" a total of 486 people were killed and 557 wounded in the incidents, notes the new york times, not including the shooters, 40 % of whom committed suicide. Only six of the shooters were women. At a briefing yesterday, an fbi behavioral analyst said that many shooters \" have a real or perceived deeply held personal grievance and the only remedy that they can perceive for that grievance is an act of catastrophic violence against a person or an institution, \" cnn reports. Chillingly, he explained that the \" copycat phenomenon is real \" and there appear to be a growing number of \" compromised and marginal individuals who are seeking inspiration from these past attacks. \"",

So report researchers this week in the british medical journal after studying the health, diets, and alcohol consumption of more than 485,000 people in china. Controlling for many variables, including family medical history, age, education, diabetes, and smoking, they found that those who ate spicy foods — mainly via chili peppers — once or twice a week enjoyed a 10 % reduced overall risk for death than those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, reports the new york times. And that reduction improved to 14 % when people ate spicy foods six or seven times a week. \" we know something about the beneficial effects of spicy foods basically from animal studies and very small-sized human studies, \" study author lu qi of harvard tells time. Some findings focus on active components like capsaicin found in chili peppers that appears to reduce inflammation and improve metabolic status, gut bacteria, and weight, he adds. \" it appears that increasing your intake moderately, just to one to two or three to five times a week, shows very similar protective effect. Just increase moderately. That's maybe enough. \" of course, more research is needed to demonstrate actual causation, but for now the link between the consumption of spicy foods and lower risk of death appears strong.

To do so, he went to ginsburg's personal trainer bryant johnson — whom she jokingly named earlier this month as the most important person in her life — and set out to do ginsburg's hourlong exercise routine, which she carries out with johnson about twice a week. Writing in politico, he says the workout \" nearly broke \" him. It started with a warmup on the elliptical and stretching ( rbg is apparently more flexible than schreckinger ) before moving on to strength training; schreckinger used more weight in order to simulate what rbg does, since schreckinger is younger and male. He went through the same series of push-ups, planks, side planks, squats, and more, and learned along the way that ginsburg barely rests between sets. \" as for ginsburg's continued vitality, after going through one of her workouts i can confirm she could not be in better hands, \" he writes. \" sore, disoriented and cranky, i didn't feel a day over 65. \" click for his full piece.",

        "summary": "Looks like north korea may be making good on at least one of its threats: after saying it would restart its yongbyon nuclear reactor, it has apparently launched construction on the site, according to a us think tank. The construction appears visible in a march 27 satellite image of yongbyon, say experts at johns hopkins university, per afp. The work may be to replace cooling mechanisms that north korea destroyed under a bush administration agreement. When working, the reactor can produce 13 pounds of plutonium annually. In another possible sign of action, the government has moved a missile to the east coast, the south's defense head says. Though its range is \" considerable, \" it's not enough to reach the us and may have been moved for training purposes. The weapon is reportedly a musudan, with a 1,900 mile range; guam is some 2,200 miles away, the new york times notes. Meanwhile, the north continues to make threats regarding the kaesong industrial zone, reuters reports. Northern officials said that if southern media \" bad-mouthing \" continues, \" we will be taking the stern measure of pulling out all of our workers \" — some 53,000 people, the times notes. That would amount to a closure of the park, which diplomats in the south consider a \" red line, \" the wall street journal reports. South korean workers at kaesong, however, are largely holding their ground, reuters notes. Only 222 out of 828 who stayed at the site overnight said they planned to go home today. But the north has been denying access to those attempting to cross the border from the south to enter the park, the times reports. Reports that pyongyang was requiring southern workers to exit kaesong by april 10, however, have been inaccurate, the south says, per the journal. Instead, the north had simply sought information on planned border crossings by staffers at south korean businesses; pyongyang wanted to know how many employees would be heading back to seoul by that date.",

Writing on the institute's 38 north blog, researchers said that the photograph showed what appeared to be construction along a road and near the back of the reactor building aimed at restoring vital cooling functions. The construction may indicate that the north koreans are connecting a secondary cooling system at the reactor to a facility built for a separate light water reactor that is located nearby.

Reuters/michael fiala ( reuters ) - a blaze that has scorched some 43,000 acres ( 17,400 hectares ) and destroyed dozens of homes near california's famed big sur coast was sparked by an illegal, unattended camp fire in a state park, authorities said on tuesday. The so-called soberanes fire, which erupted on july 22, began as a small blaze, 2 feet ( 60 cm ) in diameter, ignited by unknown individuals in a section of garrapata state park that was closed to camping and campfires, according to u.s. Forest service spokesman don jaques. No arrests have been made, he added. The more than 5,450 fire personnel battling the blaze have been able to draw containment lines - a measure of how much of its perimeter has been cleared by fire crews of unburned vegetation - around only 18 percent of the wildfire so far. Steep, mountainous terrain as well as hot, dry conditions have hampered efforts to quell the fire tearing through drought-parched chaparral, grass and timber. One person, a bulldozer operator"

Though now eligible to fill combat posts, women will not be forced to register for involuntary military service beginning in january 2018. The provision mandating that women sign up — backed by women's rights advocates, some military leaders, and sen. John mccain, per the hill — had been included in drafts of the annual defense bill that passed house and senate panels, but it was left out of a final draft revealed tuesday, reports military times. The national defense authorization act instead asks for a fresh look at the selective service system, which requires men 18 to 26 to register for the draft, to see if it's still warranted. Republican sen. Ben sasse calls the $ 618.7 billion bill \" a victory for common sense \" that shows \" both sides will put national security ahead of unnecessary culture-warring. \" some $ 59.5 billion is dedicated to the overseas contingency operations war fund, including $ 383 million for airstrikes against the islamic state. Another $ 8.3 billion will cover the hiring of more troops, plus 2 % pay raises; president obama had initially asked for $ 5.1 billion to cover those costs, reports the hill. He's not likely to be pleased by much else in the bill, though. The ap reports a presidential veto is possible as the bill also forbids closing guantanamo bay and military bases, or reducing the number of active-duty troops. The house is expected to vote on the bill by friday.",

Some examples: on donald trump: \" he is a bright personality, a talented person, no doubt about it, \" he said, per nbc news. Though he praised trump for seeking a \" closer, deeper \" relationship with russia, this wasn't exactly an endorsement: \" it is not up to us to appraise his positive sides, it is up to the us voters. But, as we can see, he is an absolute leader in the presidential race. \" his daughters: putin rarely speaks of his family, but he talked about daughters maria and katerina. \" they are taking the first steps in their careers, but are making good progress, \" he said, as quoted by reuters. \" they are not involved in business or politics \" and shun the spotlight, he said. \" i am proud of them.... My daughters speak three european languages fluently. \" turkey did what? he clearly hasn't forgiven turkey for shooting down a russian military jet, using putinesque language to suggest the turks were currying favor with the us. \" if someone in the turkish government decided to lick the americans in a certain place, well, i don't know then, was that the right decision or not? \" he asked, per the telegraph. His nobel choice: the rest of the world may think suspended fifa chief sepp blatter is a crook, but putin said blatter should win the nobel peace prize, reports the bbc. On syria: he's not budging in his support of bashar al-assad. But, as newsweek reports, he seemed to soften his approach to working with the us: \" in the attempts of regulating a conflict that has gone on for many years now, a compromise is always possible, but concessions must be made on both sides. \" real agenda: despite the \" swagger and salty language, \" putin's main point of the day seemed to be trying to convince russians themselves that the economy had bottomed out and was poised for recovery, reports the new york times.",

In his application, thiel wrote that he owned a home in new zealand but if he was granted citizenship, he would need to continue residing in the u.s. To manage his california-based companies. He said he realized his circumstances wouldn't usually qualify him for citizenship, but that he believed he was an exception"

California's chapman university last week came out with its second annual survey of american fears. The 1,541 adults who were polled were asked about 89 ( by our count ) fears that fall into what the university describes as four basic categories: personal fears, natural disasters, paranormal fears, and drivers of fear behavior. Participants were asked to assign a number to each fear ranging from 1 ( not afraid ) to 4 ( very afraid ), explains the school in a blog post. The following top 10 fears represent those in which the highest percentage of adults said they were \" afraid \" or \" very afraid. \" corruption of government officials: 58.0 % cyber-terrorism: 44.8 % corporate tracking of personal information: 44.6 % terrorist attacks: 44.4 % government tracking of personal information: 41.4 % bio-warfare: 40.9 % identity theft: 39.6 % economic collapse: 39.2 % running of out money in the future: 37.4 % credit-card fraud: 36.9 % our top personal anxiety ( at no. 17 ) is reptiles; public speaking comes in at no. 26, with heights just behind at 28; drones occupy no. 46; and we're more afraid of romantic rejection ( no. 76 ) than we are ghosts ( no. 78 ) and zombies ( no. 83 ).

        "summary": "A large, double blind study out of denmark suggests that fish oil during pregnancy may help lower a child's risk of asthma, reports the new york times, reducing rates from 24 % in women given placebos to 17 % in those given fish oil in the final trimester, amounting to a 31 % reduction in risk. And while they're not ready to recommend that pregnant women take fish oil, the lead researcher tells npr his team was surprised by the \" magnitude \" of the reduction. The difference was more pronounced among children of mothers who had low levels of fatty acids called epa and dha in their blood: by age 3, 17.5 % of children whose mothers took fish oil had developed asthma, while that number was 34.1 % among those of mothers who took the placebo. That's a reduced risk of 51 %. An nih expert writes in an accompanying editorial that factors such as these may allow development of \" precision medicine \" aimed at women most likely to benefit. Reporting in the new england journal of medicine, the researchers suggest that in spite of the conflicting conclusions in previous studies, fish oil's effect on inflammatory diseases is becoming more clear. Because small airways in the lungs further restrict when they are inflamed, and lab studies have found that lipids in fish oil could help infant airways counteract inflammation, fish oil may, at the right dose and in the right population of pregnant women, have a positive effect on developing fetuses. But until more large studies are done replicating these findings and determining when and how much which pregnant women should take fish oil to reduce their offspring's risk of asthma, doctors aren't likely to start recommending it.

North korea says it's battling \" the worst drought in 100 years \" after recording its lowest rainfall in 30 years last year as well as low levels in may, per the ap. State news agency kcna says 30 % of rice paddy fields \" are parching up, \" while up to 80 % of seedlings are withering in south hwanghae and north hwanghae provinces. Sky news reports mobile water pumps and pipes are helping get water to fields, but \" water levels of reservoirs stand at their lowest, while rivers and streams are getting dry, \" kcna says. The news raises fears of famine like that of the 1990s, which killed hundreds of thousands, though some say agricultural reforms and reserves would ease suffering, reports the bbc. The country already endures food shortages and a third of children are malnourished. The bbc notes the very fact that the country is mentioning the drought is evidence of its seriousness and perhaps a call for help. The un offers north korea about $ 50 million in aid each year, down from $ 300 million in 2004, but called for $ 111 million in april to fund humanitarian needs. South korea also lends a hand, though some residents question that decision. Propaganda posters in the north show citizens working together with farmers, with the caption, \" let's mobilize the masses and fight with all our strength against the drought. \" a rep from the american friends service committee, which operates farm projects in north korea, says farm managers are also \" receiving training in dry rice planting techniques and other measures that they were trying to conserve water. \" kcna adds other crops are now being planted in rice paddy fields to \" reduce damage. \"",

Previous next enlarge the dallas nurse who became the first person to contract ebola in the u.s. Was unmasked monday as a 26-year-old health care provider who has been on the job for four years. Nina pham was identified by family members, wfaa.com in dallas reported. She graduated from texas christian university's nursing program in 2010, but didn't get her certificate in critical care nursing until aug. 1. That is less than two months before thomas duncan, who contracted ebola while on a visit to liberia, showed up at pham's hospital. He died of the disease wednesday. Now the feds are looking into whether the nurse contracted ebola while she was taking off her protective equipment.

            "( cnn ) the nurse in texas seemed to have taken all the precautions needed to protect herself from ebola. She wore a mask, gown, shield and gloves. Her patient, a man who contracted the virus in africa, was in isolation at the dallas hospital where she worked. And yet the woman -- whose name has not been released -- still contracted ebola, marking the first known transmission ever in the united states. A nurse in spain who also treated an ebola patient also caught the virus. She is in critical condition and being treated by 50 health care workers, spanish authorities said monday. The centers for disease control and prevention said sunday there was a breach in protocol in texas, but officials haven't elaborated on what that breach was. Instead, they said the protocols laid out for american hospitals work. So what happened? how could a nurse at an american hospital contract the virus? is the situation a one-off, an instance of human error, something that probably wouldn't occur again? or could there be more to it? how it happened on monday morning, an official with direct knowledge of the texas nurse's case told cnn that cdc disease detectives have several times interviewed the texas nurse and think there are \" inconsistencies \" in the type of personal protective gear"

New york-based millennium partners tells the san francisco business times that the skyscraper is just one of several area buildings developed in the colma formation of sand, and the european space agency images confirm that multiple other buildings are sinking as well. Millennium partners first announced the tower was sinking in august, and lawsuits have already been filed by regulators, including the san francisco city attorney, as well as homeowners concerned over the sinking value of their investments in the $ 350 million building. Two homeowners have also filed a civil claim against the city and transbay joint powers authority over concerns that nearby activity may have removed groundwater, thus making the ground less stable.

On wednesday, a clown with orange hair was reportedly chasing people with a club, for example, but when sheriff's deputies responded, there was no evidence of a clown or of any victims. Now the kern county sheriff's office says it thinks the calls are halloween pranks — inspired by the \" wasco clown, \" a person dressed as a clown, holding balloons, and standing in various locations throughout the san joaquin valley town of wasco in pictures posted on a creepy instagram account. The \" wasco clown \" soared to prominence after being written about on la blogs, in newspapers, on slate, and even on the daily mail, the bakersfield californian reports. Wasco locals reported seeing the clown around town beginning oct. 1, and, as laist notes, an urban legend was quickly born, with similar clowns popping up in nearby cities — reportedly often with weapons ( ax, machete, bat, etc. ) in hand. But the sheriff's office says none of the calls about armed clowns has actually been substantiated. At the nearby bakersfield police department, which as of last week had received 16 reported sightings of its own, a sergeant theorized, \" we may have people dressing up as clowns, and we get there and they're not there. \" one teen, who says he was inspired by the wasco clown, has been arrested for dressing up as an unarmed clown and scaring schoolkids, bakersfield now reports. As for the original wasco clown himself, he spoke anonymously to kget and said the pictures are part of a photography project his wife is doing. ( last year, britain saw a similar phenomenon. )",

But fox40 reports the 26-year-old developed a toothache that forced him off the road in oklahoma, where a dentist cleaned an infected tooth and prescribed antibiotics. He felt better until he reached new york, where severe pain and swelling set in. Unable to drive home, brother miroslav traveled to him; the two made it as far back as utah where, with vadim struggling to breathe, miroslav checked him into a hospital. Four days passed, then \" the doctor said tonight is the night he's gonna die, because we did everything we can and nothing seems to work, \" says his wife, nataliya. She was at his side when he died monday. \"they had him on medication, they tried everything, \" she tells the sacramento bee. \" it was just not healing how it was supposed to. It was just getting worse. \" such infections generally begin when food is trapped between the tooth and gum, a dentist tells the newspaper. The resulting bacteria gets into the tooth, leading to painful inflammation, but only rarely does the infection make it into the bloodstream, which can have deadly consequences. Vadim leaves behind daughters vanessa, 2, and maya, 11 months. \" he's gonna be my angel for the rest of my life, \" his wife says of the man she spent four years with. A gofundme account, which notes vadim was the family's breadwinner, had raised about $ 150,000 as of wednesday. The money will be used in part to return his body to the sacramento area.

Craig tieszen, 68, and his brother-in-law, 61-year-old brent moline, borrowed hotel kayaks last wednesday and paddled out around 9am into what is described as having been a tranquil lagoon. But as a facebook post from cook islands police explains, they became \" caught in the current and they were dragged to where the waves were breaking. \" police say they were accompanied by a younger male who tried to rescue them and then returned to the hotel to get help. Police were alerted just before 11am. One man \" was retrieved from on the reef, \" the other, \" from over the reef. \" a cook islands police rep tells the argus leader that no life jackets were recovered, but that lagoon kayakers often don't use them because the water is so calm. He said rough waves stripped the men of their clothing. Both were pronounced dead just before 1pm. The rapid city journal cites an interview with the president of cook islands water safety, who said the channel that links the muri lagoon to the ocean features signs warning of strong currents. The black hills pioneer reports the men were in the cook islands to attend tieszen's daughter's wedding, which was scheduled for that day. The journal adds that something similar reportedly happened two years ago, when a 50-year-old man and a 43-year-old woman died after one fell in and the other attempted a rescue.",

Here's what they're saying: \" it's a good, smart, careful movie, \" that elicited a \" symphony of sniffles \" from the screening audience, but it's not quite as good as the book, observes moira macdonald at the seattle times. \" you only get that gut-punch of emotion once. The book did me in; the movie just nicked me. \" and while fans may be pleased that the movie is \" meticulously faithful, \" it \" makes for a slightly sterile movie experience \" that \" does occasionally stumble into teen-movie gooeyness. \" \" make no mistake, fault is a certifiable weepie, but it comes by most of its emotions honestly … without the heart-tugging calculation that brings so many tear-jerkers down, \" writes betsy sharkey at the la times. Woodley's performance anchors the film and \" heals all of its wounds, \" allowing you to \" mourn her fate, but save your pity for someone else. \" it's \" the most beautifully made cynical thing i've ever seen, \" writes a seriously conflicted mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle. \" the story can be outguessed within five minutes, \" and some of the dialogue feels phony — but other lines and moments feel truly revelatory. \" manipulative in the worst way, it's also manipulative in the best way, so that, in order to be unmoved by it, you would have to try actively to be a jerk. \" of course, a handful of critics hate it. \" this movie is so tone-deaf it would only make sense in vincent van gogh's missing ear, \" writes joe williams at the st. Louis post-dispatch, objecting in part to a scene where \" cancer is conflated with the holocaust. \" and while most critics praised elgort's performance, williams thinks he's a \" major disaster \" and \" the worst thing to happen to teen romances since herpes. \"",

        "summary": "The image of the last supper as famously painted by leonardo da vinci — jesus and his followers seated around a large table, bread, wine — is a lasting one. It's also entirely inaccurate, according to two italian archeologists. Discovery reports generoso urciuoli and marta berogno studied jewish writings, ancient roman works, catacomb paintings, descriptions of other meals from the bible, and more to figure out what was for dinner and how it was eaten in the jerusalem of jesus'time. \" the bible discusses what happened during [ the last supper ], but it doesn't detail what jesus and his 12 dining companions ate, \" urciuoli says. In addition to unleavened bread and aromatized wine, jesus ' final meal before he was crucified likely included lamb, bean stew, herbs, olives, and fish sauce. Instead of a large rectangular table, the last supper was almost certainly eaten while reclining on cushions placed on the floor with the food on a low table.

This is about scaring our community.

The \" shooting, \" done with fake blood and cardboard guns, was complete by the time \" farting \" protesters arrived. Pro-gun organizer murdoch pizgatti says surprise was the point: \" you don't get a time and place, you don't get a flier or an invitation for a true mass shooting, \" he explains. \" they happen unannounced. \" open carry of long-arm weapons such as rifles is currently legal in texas; licensed gun owners will be able to do the same with handguns starting jan. 1, and concealed carry will be allowed in most public-college buildings starting next august.",

It's unfortunate he couldn't find a better script in all that time, but you can't have everything. The bigger picture: with the lines in his face now making him look like he stepped right out of a frank miller comic ( seriously, if there's ever a sin city 2, he needs to be in it ), gibson brings his more-convincing-than-ever loose cannon persona to the role of thomas craven, a traditionalist boston cop whose teenage daughter returns home mysteriously ill, only to be shot to death on his front porch by a masked gunman. Craven,",
            "\" edge of darkness \" opens with a gorgeous, unsettling image: a placid body of water shimmers beneath a glowing orb of a moon, a picture of serenity that's broken first by one corpse popping to the surface, followed by another and another. The image suggests we're in for an artful noir, a picture that just might deliver more moody atmosphere than thuggish thrills. We can dream, can't we? \" edge of darkness \" is somewhat stylish, and it's intelligently made: the director is martin campbell ( \" casino royale \" ), and he's reprising, in a condensed form, the popular british miniseries of the same name he directed in 1985. ( that series was written by troy kennedy-martin; william monahan and andrew bovell have adapted the script for the big screen. ) the story is serpentine and engaging,",

        "summary": "Thanks to french president francois hollande, jacqueline sauvage will be leaving a french prison in april after serving three and a half years of a 10-year sentence for killing her husband, the guardian reports. Sauvage — who said norbert marot, her husband of 47 years, was an alcoholic who raped and beat her and her three daughters and abused her son — shot marot in the back with a rifle the day after her son hanged himself in september 2012. But hollande, recognizing the circumstances behind the killing, made the rare move of waiving the remainder of sauvage's five-year minimum sentence so she could apply for release in april ( meaning, as the independent notes, it's not technically a full pardon ). \" in the face of an exceptional human situation, the president wanted to make it possible for … sauvage to return to her family as soon as possible, \" hollande's office said in a statement. Although what sauvage did may have been defensible after so many years of abuse, french law presents a trickier situation: an act such as marot's killing can only be labeled self-defense if it's a direct response to, and proportional to, the original act of aggression. Sauvage was sentenced to 10 years in prison in october 2014, and that judgment was upheld on appeal this past december, with the state prosecutor arguing that her firing three shots into marot's back was inadmissible, the bbc notes. But the public rallied to her defense, with more than 400,000 people asking hollande to get involved, and he did — just two days after meeting with sauvage's three grown daughters — despite what the bbc labels his \" qualms \" at using the presidential pardon ( he's only used it once before ). \" i ' m overwhelmed, happy, grateful, relieved, \" the founder of an advocacy group for sauvage tells the guardian.

At least 17 of his colleagues are included in a death toll that authorities say has now reached 54, and which the new york times reports would have been much higher if the blasts had happened during the day — or if winds had blown toxic fumes over the city of 15 million instead of out to sea. According to state media, 66 firefighters are among the more than 700 people injured by the blasts, at least 71 of them seriously. The military has sent in hundreds of specialists to investigate. As some fires in the district still smolder, officials are investigating the cause of the blasts at a warehouse that handles hazardous materials, reports reuters. According to state media, several containers were on fire inside the warehouse before the blasts, and experts suspect firefighters may have sprayed water on the toxic chemical calcium carbide, which would cause an explosive reaction. More than 6,000 people have been displaced by the disaster, the guardian reports. Residents are lining up to donate blood to the injured, though many are also criticizing the government's response and its failure to keep them informed.
