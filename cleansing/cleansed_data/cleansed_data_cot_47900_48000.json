The change doesn't affect users who set up email forwarding previously. Yahoo says the feature was temporarily disabled \" as part of previously planned maintenance to improve its functionality \" and will be \" back up and running as soon as possible, \" but a user hoping to switch services after 18 years couldn't help but notice the \" extremely suspicious timing. \" the feature has been \" a basic concept for 15 years, \" another user says. The fact that \" all of a sudden it's under development, and only at yahoo … seems extremely dubious to me. \" rightly so, per techcrunch, since email forwarding wouldn't \" need to be shut down in order to be ' improved.

Pressley also spoke on cbs this morning and nbc's today show, where she said cosby won't make any plea deal. \" my client is not guilty, and there will be no consideration on our part of any sort of arrangement, \" she said, per reuters. Pressley was also forced to defend whisperings that the 78-year-old cosby's supposedly feeble appearance at his arraignment wednesday in elkins park, pa., was a strategic part of his defense ploy. \" i don't really understand it, \" pressley said on gma, per abc news. \" he's a tall man of sufficient girth. He's … blind, so he does use a cane so that he can know what's coming in front of him and he does require assistance because of that and that is who the da's office has chosen to charge. \" she adds, per the daily news: \" that's not a defense of a crime, that's just a fact. \" meanwhile, constand, the woman behind the case that may put cosby behind bars, posted a message early thursday morning on twitter, imploring, \" let's all stay classy plz! that includes anybody who may be inserting their opinion as to whether anything was fully investigated period. \" ( here's the rundown on some of the cosby coverage so far. )",

The feature sends facebook users in areas affected by a crisis a message asking whether they are safe, and then gives them the option of checking \" yes, let my friends know, \" to let their friends know they are ok. The feature was first activated after the nepal earthquake earlier this year and was turned on during three subsequent natural disasters, the journal notes. The paris response could point the way for social media use during future crises, though wired reports that there was one problem with the #porteouverte hashtag: so many people tweeted about how inspiring it was that users worried real offers of help might be crowded out.",

All of which, as mediaite notes, is spurring a good amount of vitriol online. Much of the backlash centers on the appropriation of black lives matter-style symbols and the minimizing of issues such as oppression by having jenner \" solve \" things with a can of pepsi. It's \" a perfect example of what happens when there's no black people in the room when decisions are being made, \" tweeted comedian travon free. Per cnbc, some also note jenner handing the cop a pepsi resembles a protest photo of mom ieshia evans that went viral last year. The ad gets a bit of praise from harper's bazaar: it notes \" lions, \" the background song by bob marley's grandson skip marley, is the one \" redeeming \" part, \" an anthemic call to arms to take action and make a difference while promoting strength and togetherness. \" pepsi's response, via a statement to cnnmoney: \" this is a global ad that reflects people from different walks of life coming together in a spirit of harmony. \"",

It found that stressful events in the latter stage of a woman's pregnancy may increase the risk of movement and coordination deficits later in the child's life. Reporting this week in the journal child development, researchers at the university of notre dame australia say they followed 2,900 australian mothers, testing them at 18 and 34 weeks pregnant to document stressful events during pregnancy such as divorce, death in the family, a move, or pregnancy issues. Fast-forward a decade: when these women's children were 10, 14, and 17 years old, the offspring had their motor development and general coordination — things like hand strength, walking heel-toe, and standing on one foot — tested. The more stressful events a mother experienced ( particularly those who went through three or more such events ), especially later in pregnancy, the worse the children performed at every age tested. But the head of the developmental and behavioral pediatrics department at a new york hospital tells live science that it's hard to read too much into the findings. The skills tested for \" may not necessarily matter much in life, \" he says, as compared to, say, testing for whether the kids could button a shirt. \" those might be more real-world examples of motor deficits that affect people on a daily basis. \" either way, study co-author beth hands says in a press release that the results suggest programs that help reduce maternal stress in pregnancy could improve outcomes for these children.

Like its relative the shark, however, it's made of cartilage and thus rarely fossilizes, so little is known about its evolutionary past, reports live science. Now the blanks have been filled in thanks to a \" remarkable \" 280 million-year-old fossil found on a farm in cape province, south africa, in the 1980s that was thought to be a symmoriid shark. Researchers at the university of chicago medical center report in a sciencedaily news release that the specimen — micro ct scan images of which one reviewer describes as \" dripping with data \" — is actually an early chimaera, not a shark. The specimen offers \" a glimpse of the preconditions from which modern chimaeras evolved. \" reporting in the journal nature, the team says the fossil establishes strong links between the brains, major cranial nerves, nostrils, and inner ears of early and modern chimaeras. We're learning more about elusive modern chimaeras, too: scientists recently said they think they've captured video of a type of ghost shark never filmed before; the washington post published the footage of what's believed to be a pointy-nosed blue chimaera last month. Filmed off the coast of central california, it's the first seen outside the pacific waters of australia and new zealand, suggesting widespread populations. Scientists have yet to work out what chimaeras eat, how often they reproduce, or even how long they live. ( researchers who filmed the ghost shark say it came down to \" dumb luck. \" )",

This discovery, published early online in nature on jan. 4, allows scientists to firmly anchor chimaeroids -- the last major surviving vertebrate group to be properly situated on the tree of life -- in evolutionary history, and sheds light on the early development of these fish as they diverged from their deep, shared ancestry with sharks. \" chimaeroids belong somewhere close to the sharks and rays, but there's always been uncertainty when you search deeper in time for their evolutionary branching point, \" said michael coates, phd, professor of organismal biology and",

This discovery, published early online in nature on jan. 4, allows scientists to firmly anchor chimaeroids -- the last major surviving vertebrate group to be properly situated on the tree of life -- in evolutionary history, and sheds light on the early development of these fish as they diverged from their deep, shared ancestry with sharks. \" chimaeroids belong somewhere close to the sharks and rays, but there's always been uncertainty when you search deeper in time for their evolutionary branching point, \" said michael coates, phd, professor of organismal biology and",
            "The pointy-nosed blue chimaera, or ghost shark, was filmed alive for the first time ever off the coasts of hawaii and california. The deep-sea fish was previously known only from specimens caught in the southwestern pacific ocean. ( jorge ribas/the washington post ) like its greek mythological namesake, the chimaera — or \"ghost shark \" — is a mysterious, rarely seen creature with a patchwork of bizarre features. Dwelling in the depths of the ocean, its eyes are pale and seemingly dead. Where teeth should be, the ghost shark uses tooth plates instead to grind food. Their heads are lined with cryptic dots, like the remnant scars of ancient stitches. Male chimaeras have retractable sex organs — on their foreheads. Its other nicknames — ratfish, rabbitfish, spookfish — hint at how bizarre chimaeras are in appearance. And now, scientists believe they have captured on video a species of",
            "A 280-million-year-old skull of a so-called ghost shark has helped researchers determine exactly how chimaeras — mysterious, mostly deep-sea fish with wing-like fins and pointy snouts — are related to sharks, a new study finds. The ancient skull, belonging to the 4-foot-long ( 1.2 meters ) shark-like fish dwykaselachus oosthuizeni, was a rare find, as this animal's skeleton is made of cartilage, which rarely fossilizes, the researchers said. An anatomical examination showed that the animal had a surprising number of similarities to modern chimaeras — also called ghost sharks for their silvery white exterior and overall appearance — suggesting that the two types of creature are related, the researchers said. \" chimaeras are ancient specialists, now anchored within a large and very distinctive group of early shark-like fishes that thrived in the late paleozoic era, \" said the study's lead researcher michael coates, a professor in the department"

        "summary": "The journal nature has published a controversial paper describing how university of wisconsin scientists created an airborne strain of h5n1 — aka \" bird flu \" — that was transmissible in mammals. A federal panel had asked nature not to publish the study, and a similar one from a dutch virologist, fearing they might provide a handy diy guide for bioterrorists, the washington post reports. They eventually dropped their objections, however, once they realized that the more-contagious virus was also less deadly. Researchers added two mutations to a deadly h5n1 strain, mixed in some swine flu genes, and released it on a group of ferrets. The ferrets caught the virus easily — but didn't die or even get very sick. The research was conducted to understand how the virus might mutate in nature — and indeed, scientists say the process was simple enough to occur naturally, the la times reports. \" it's a great place to start looking for exactly what's going on, \" says one virologist.",

Authorities say the 17-year-old, identified as anneli-marie r., was kidnapped while walking her dog near meissen around 7: 30pm last thursday. About half an hour later, her father received a phone call from anneli-marie's phone: it was one of her captors demanding $ 1.3 million in ransom. Investigators say the last sounds he heard from his daughter were reportedly her screams on the line. Though the girl's family told the kidnappers in a letter that they would \" fulfill your demands in order to be able to take our child in our arms again, \" her body was found on a farm monday, hours after the arrests of two men, 39 and 61, reports nbc news. Police — some 1,200 of them were involved in the case — say they found the suspects by tracking cell phones, reports nbc news. Authorities say the men, unmasked during the crime, probably killed anneli-marie on friday so she wouldn't expose them to police; they found no evidence of sexual assault. Friday was the last day a kidnapper and the teen's father spoke; nbc news notes the family wanted to pay the ransom but couldn't wire it to a foreign bank as instructed in the specified time frame. Officials suspect there was a good deal of planning before the crime. \" based on the investigation so far, the younger suspect was supposedly taking walks with a dog in the area to find out at what times the girl was out and about, \" says a rep for the dresden prosecutors ' office.

According to abc news, the identity of the victim has not been released. An aransas county judge says 12 to 14 people were injured in the area, the ap reports. Officials expect to find more victims as searches continue. When hurricane harvey hit rockport, a city of about 10,000 people, winds were peaking at 125mph. The wind and rain prevented emergency crews from responding to distress calls. At one point saturday morning, 22 firefighters were stuck sheltering in a fire station, forced to ignore up to 30 requests for help. Texas gov. Greg abbott says it's too early to make any guesses as to the extent of property damage or casualties. But in rockport, where residents who ignored a mandatory evacuation were advised to write their identities on their arm, buildings were destroyed. Wax described the situation to the post in an email: \"widespread devastation unknown loss of life. \" the area could still face serious flooding, with up to 60 inches of rain by the middle of next week. Meanwhile, some texas residents remained unimpressed with harvey's fury. A 56-year-old man in galveston described his most-pressing concern: \" we're running low on corona. \"",

Guzman, a former leader of the sinaloa cartel, is currently awaiting extradition to the united states. He was recaptured in january after breaking out of a high-security prison. Mr inzunza is suspected of laundering $ 300m-$ 400m a year for the sinaloa cartel through a network of companies and currency exchange centres. A us federal court in washington had requested mr inzunza's arrest and he is likely to be extradited. Guzman himself is also facing extradition to the us on charges of drug trafficking in california, and murder in texas. Earlier this month, he asked for the extradition process to progress rapidly so he could receive better treatment in prison. Since guzman's recapture in january, six months after he escaped from prison, he has been subject to a stricter regime."

        "summary": "Canadian prime minister justin trudeau's state visit to washington went so smoothly that social media and even the press seem agreed that a \" bromance \" has bloomed. In the first such visit since jean chretien dined with bill clinton at the white house in 1997, trudeau and president obama discussed issues including terrorism and climate change and appeared so much in sync that the washington post, afp, and the new york times, among many others, used that bromance descriptor. It was also big on twitter, notes ctv. Meanwhile, canada's globe and mail notes that michelle obama introduced sophie grégoire-trudeau as her \" soulmate \" when the spouses attended an event to promote girls ' education thursday morning. The two countries are \" closer than friends, \" trudeau said at the thursday night state dinner, which was peppered with canadian celebrities, including ryan reynolds and michael j. Fox, the post reports. \" we're more like siblings, really, \" he said. \" we have shared heritage, though we took different paths in our later years. We became the stay-at-home type. You grew to be a little more rebellious. \" obama praised the \" enormous energy \" of the canadian delegation and warned the new leader: \" if in fact you plan to keep your dark hair, then you have to start dying it early. You hit a certain point, it's too late. You ' ll be caught. \" mcclatchy notes that trudeau would be wise to push for a close relationship with the obama administration now, as bromance is unlikely to blossom between the liberal leader and the likes of donald trump or ted cruz.",

Police in the seminole heights neighborhood say a gunman fatally shot 60-year-old ronald felton as he crossed a street about 5am tuesday, reports the tampa bay times. Felton was killed in the same area as three other apparently random victims in separate incidents in october. \" we've had another one, \" said brian dugan, chief of tampa's police force. \" we will hunt this person down until we find them, \" added mayor bob buckhorn. Police previously released a video of a suspect, and this time they also have a description from a witness who saw him running from the scene, per wfla: a black male about 6 feet tall, with a thin build and light complexion. He was dressed in all-black clothing and carrying a large pistol. \" we think by their proximity and the manner it was done, they are linked, \" said dugan. \" we're saying it's related to the other seminole heights murders. \" police think the killer lives in the seminole heights neighborhood and are asking residents not only to be cautious but to help identify him. Felton, an unemployed construction worker, is believed to have been on his way to a local church food bank, where he volunteered, reports nbc news. The previous victims — benjamin mitchell, 22, monica hoffa, 32, and anthony naiboa, 20 — were shot on oct. 9, 13, and 19, respectively. Felton was killed just blocks from a memorial to the first three victims. ( the way the suspect flips a cellphone while walking may be a clue, say police. )",

That's what his parents thought, too, when they dropped him off at a mcdonald's in the chicago suburbs on new year's eve to meet up with 18-year-old jordan hill, who had been a classmate. The victim and hill drove around together ( in what police say was a van stolen by hill ) visiting friends for two days, with the victim sleeping in the van. On tuesday, they ended up at a chicago apartment where sisters brittany and tanishia covington, ages 18 and 24, lived. What would ultimately turn into the shocking beating, broadcast live for 28 minutes and viewed millions of times on social media, started as a \" play fight \" between the victim and hill, the chicago tribune reports. It escalated, and police say the covington sisters got angry and tied the victim up. A downstairs neighbor heard noises and threatened to call police; two of the suspects left to allegedly kick down that neighbor's door, allowing the victim to escape, the ap reports. Hill, the covington sisters, and 18-year-old tesfaye cooper were all charged with a hate crime due to racial slurs and comments about the victim's disability they were allegedly heard making on the video. A family spokesperson says the victim has had \" profound emotional and physical disabilities throughout his life, \" and the missing persons report notes that he \" does not like telling his parents who he's with \" ( his mother knew only jordan hill's first name, not his last ).

By examining the sleepers ' brainwaves over a range of frequencies, scientists have found that lucid dreamers demonstrate a shift towards a more \" awake-like \" state in the frontal and temporal parts of the brain, with the peak in increased activity occurring around 40hz. \" lucid dreaming is a very good tool to observe what happens in the brain and what is causally necessary for",
            "In lucid dreams, people are aware of the fact that they are dreaming, and can control their dream plot. Lucid dreams, in which people are aware of and can control their dreams, are rare. But now scientists have found they can induce this weird state of mind in people by zapping their brains with a specific frequency of electricity. \" i never thought this would work, \" said study researcher dr. John allan hobson, a psychiatrist and longtime sleep researcher at harvard university. \" but it looks like it does. \" the results showed that when the inexperienced dreamers were zapped with a current of 40 hertz, 77 percent of the time these participants reported having what were described as lucid dreams. \" they were really excited, \" said study researcher ursula voss, of j.w. Goethe-university frankfurt, who designed the experiments. \" the dream reports were short, but long enough for them to report, ' wow, all of the sudden i knew this was a dream, while i was dreaming. ' \" [ 7 mind-bending facts about dreams ] dream waves a lucid dream can be thought of as an overlap between two states of consciousness — the one that exists in normal dreaming, and the one during wakefulness, which involves higher levels of awareness and control. \" if i ' m aware, if"

        "summary": "The task was hard enough, even without complications: forensic anthropologists were trying to identify the remains of migrants who perished in remote south texas while trying to cross from mexico into the us. Many of those remains ended up in a cemetery in falfurrias, and when the volunteers made 52 exhumations, they expected to find 52 corpses. Instead, as the corpus christi caller-times reports, they found many more — but they can't say for sure given the state of burial. They discovered remains jammed into trash bags, shopping bags, and body bags; bones from multiple bodies inside the same bags; and some remains without any containers whatsoever. In short, it looked more like a dump than a cemetery, they say. \"to me it's just as shocking as the mass grave that you would picture in your head, and it's just as disrespectful, \" says one of the anthropologists, from the university of indianapolis. The remains are in a brooks county cemetery, and the county pays the funeraria del angel howard-williams funeral home $ 450 per body to handle burials. The funeral home has \"certain records related to these burials, but this does not amount to confirmation that howard-williams was involved in depositing the remains in the manner the researchers described, \" says a spokesperson. Vocativ picks up on this aspect of the story: complaints about improper burials often originate from the families of the deceased, \" an issue when it comes to unidentified migrants, whose families have no way of knowing where they ended up. \" ( brooks county has seen a big increase in illegal immigrants trying to cross the border in recent years. )",

        "summary": "Of cancers that strike both men and women, colorectal cancer is the no. 2 killer in the us, reports the cdc, claiming more than 50,000 lives in 2013. Previous studies out of harvard found that a common oral bacteria accelerates the cancer's growth in animals, but since the so-called fusobacteria are more prevalent in the mouth than the gut, it remained unclear how fusobacteria localize to the cancer. In a new study published in cell host &amp; microbe, researchers out of israel and harvard get at that mystery, finding bacteria may travel from the mouth to the gut and colon via the bloodstream. They tested this by injecting fusobacteria into the tail veins of mice with either precancerous or malignant colorectal tumors; the researchers subsequently detected fusobacteria in the tumors, per a press release. What's more, the researchers found that fusobacteria carry a protein called fap2 that binds to a sugar called gal-galnac found on the surface of colorectal tumors, reports medical news today. While study author wendy garrett warns that \" it may not be possible to prevent oral microbes from entering the bloodstream and reaching colorectal tumors, \" it's possible that drugs that target fap2 or gal-galnac might impede the binding and prevent fusobacteria from contributing to tumor development. And garrett says the research could bear other fruit: \" if we know how fusobacteria localize and become enriched in colon tumors, hopefully we can utilize the same or similar mechanisms to guide and deliver cancer therapeutics to colon tumors. \" ( one in seven colorectal cancer patients is now under this age. )",

Before jumping into the water himself, moreno made what he thought was a final phone call to his own mother, then sent a series of chilling text messages to the baby's 19-year-old mother, adrianne oyola, per the hartford courant. According to court records, denise moreno says she got a call from her son late sunday asking her to come to the arrigoni bridge. She could hear aaden crying in the background as her son said, \" just tell everyone i ' m sorry. \" she called 911 and got to the bridge right before police did and just in time to see tony jump, with an empty baby stroller nearby. Shortly before that, oyola started getting heart-stopping texts from moreno. \" i ' ll text you in the morning to see when you ' ll be dropping off aaden, \" she wrote shortly after 11: 30pm, per fox connecticut, to which moreno responded, \" i won't be. … enjoy your new life without us. \" her texts to moreno started to get more frantic. \" don't play around like that. Please don't try and take him from me!!!! … i ' m trying to make this co parent thing work, \" to which she got the response: \" your [ sic ] not a parent anymore … he's dead … and soon i will be too. \" meanwhile, a family court judge who had denied oyola a permanent restraining order against moreno is under fire for his decision, per the courant.

        "summary": "The amtrak train in tuesday night's deadly crash was going the speed limit until just before the derailment, when it mysteriously sped up when it should have slowed down, according to national transportation safety board investigators. Ntsb member robert sumwalt says that in the space of around a minute, the train's speed jumped from 70mph to 102mph, the philadelphia inquirer reports. Sumwalt says it's not clear whether engineer brandon bostian — who was concussed and has \" no explanation \" for the derailment — accelerated manually. Sumwalt says inspection records haven't revealed any problems with the track, signals, or the siemens \" cities sprinter \" locomotive itself, reports usa today. Bostian has told investigators he has no memory of the crash or of engaging the emergency brake, but sumwalt says he did so seconds before the derailment, cnn reports. He says the engineer, who's recovering from multiple injuries, has agreed to be interviewed by the ntsb and will be allowed to have a lawyer present. The \" positive train control \" system that could have prevented the crash was just months away from becoming a reality in the northeast corridor, reports the new york times. John boehner called a question about funding cuts contributing to the crash \" stupid \" yesterday, but funding problems did contribute to the delay, the times reports. The train — and the tracks — were already equipped with the system, but it took four years to buy the rights to airwaves to switch it on. An eighth victim was found by a cadaver dog yesterday. Like many other victims, ecolab exec bob gildersleeve, 45, was on his way home to his family. When he didn't make it home on tuesday, his wife and two teenagers traveled to philadelphia to search hospitals for him, nbc philadelphia reports. Though there are still many questions surrounding the crash — especially the increase in speed — amtrak says it takes full responsibility for it, the ap reports. \" with truly heavy hearts, we mourn those who died. Their loss leaves holes in the lives of their families and communities, \" ceo joseph boardman said in a statement. \" amtrak takes full responsibility and deeply apologizes for our role in this tragic event. \" amtrak says full service between new york and philadelphia should resume early next week.",

The deal — the biggest of its kind since 1998's $ 206 billion settlement with the tobacco industry — was hammered out during almost a year of negotiations between the banks and all 50 state attorneys general, reports the new york times. The money will go to some 2 million homeowners affected by the crisis. Under the settlement, some 750,000 people who lost their homes to foreclosure will receive payouts of around $ 2,000 each, a million people will have their mortgage debt cut, and 300,000 will be able to refinance their homes at lower rates, reports politico. Analysts say that the deal, while small compared to the $ 700 billion in negative equity american homeowners are struggling with, could do a lot to turn the housing market around. Banks sought immunity from prosecution in return for the settlement, but officials will still be able to investigate any criminal wrongdoing in mortgage robo-signing and other abuses.",

That child was raised as paul fronczak — but a dna test this year shows it wasn't him. Now, the fbi is reopening the case, the chicago tribune reports. The man raised as fronczak is hoping to find the kidnapping victim, not to mention his own birth parents. \" i ' m in this for the long haul, \" he says. \" the perfect ending would be to find the real paul, see that he's doing well and then on the same day find my real family, \" he says. In 1964, a woman posing as a nurse told mom dora fronczak the baby needed an exam; the \" nurse \" and the baby disappeared in a taxi, the chicago sun-times notes. Investigators thought they'd found the baby in new jersey, identifying an abandoned child as fronczak partially based on the shape of his ears. Now, the fbi hopes \" new witnesses come forward, \" and it may \" subject some of the physical evidence to new and previously unavailable forensic examinations, \" says a rep.",

        "summary": "Under pressure from president trump and many of his republican colleagues, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said tuesday that he will bring legislation to the floor as soon as this week to overhaul the nation's sentencing laws. Mcconnell's decision comes after more than three years of overtures from a large, bipartisan group of senators who support the criminal justice bill, including senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley and house speaker paul ryan. Trump announced his support for the legislation last month, but mcconnell only cautiously said the bill was among a number of competing priorities for the lame-duck session. The key things to know, per the ap: texas sen. John cornyn, the no. 2 republican, said trump's push for the legislation ( the president tweeted about it last week ) had been \" critical to the outcome here... The president was insistent that this be included. \" if the legislation passes, it could be a rare bipartisan policy achievement for this congress and the largest sentencing overhaul in decades. Most democrats support the bill, which would revise 1980s and ' 90s-era \" tough on crime \" laws to boost rehabilitation efforts for federal prisoners and give judges more discretion when sentencing nonviolent offenders, particularly for drug offenses. Supporters say the changes would make the nation's criminal justice system fairer, reduce overcrowding in federal prisons, and save taxpayer dollars. The legislation has been a priority for trump's son-in-law, jared kushner, who has worked behind the scenes with supportive republican senators over the last two years and pushed trump to support it. It was also a top issue for former president barack obama, who had hoped to see the bill become law before he left office. Supporters have long said that the bill would pass if mcconnell would just put it on the floor. But mcconnell appeared to have concerns that it would divide his caucus. One vocal gop opponent, sen. Tom cotton of arkansas, has criticized the bill as allowing for early release of serious and repeat felons. It's unclear how long it will take to move the bill. Mcconnell said senators should be prepared to stay in session the week following christmas if necessary to complete their work.",

            "Art in this country is made by and for liberals. This is a claim that has apparently endless appeal for all parts of the political spectrum. Conservatives like to believe that liberal cultural touchstones have captured the media wholesale, leaving a few, proud freethinkers to fight against the power. Thus adam bellow's recent call ( already mocked on splice by nicky smith ) for a counter-culture of valiant conservative novelists to \" fight back against this liberal establishment with its politically correct regime of thought control. \" liberals, meanwhile, enjoy imagining that they are naturally more artistic, funny, daring, and generally aesthetically awesome than their conservative counterparts. \" … artists of all types have always been more likely to be liberals — challenging tradition, exploring new ways of seeing — and always will be, \" paul waldman declares smugly, on his way to telling bellow that his hope for successful conservative novelists is a pipedream. So bellow from the right and waldman from the left are united in bipartisan amity. That's a rare and beautiful thing … but in this case it's also foolishness. If you don't think there are successful conservative novels with a mainstream profile, i have four words for you. Gone with the wind. Admittedly, margaret mitchell's gone with the wind is old; it",

French researchers who reviewed hundreds of other studies were unable to find any link between taking vitamin d supplements and having a reduced risk of contracting illnesses including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The review suggests \" decreases in vitamin d levels are a marker of deteriorating health, \" the lead researcher says. Experts not involved in the study say that while it shows that more long-term studies of the vitamin's effects are needed, it shouldn't be a reason for people ceasing to take supplements — especially among groups at risk of deficiency, including older people, pregnant and breastfeeding women, young children, and people with darker skin. The french study also failed to look at bone health, critics note. \" it has been known for almost a century that vitamin d supplements given to those with deficient vitamin d levels results in improved bone health, preventing hypocalcemic seizure and rickets, \" a leading pediatrician tells the bbc.",

According to consumerist, cohen doesn't want to see airline seats continue to get smaller. The seat act would force the faa to agree to a minimum size. \"consumers are tired of being squeezed both physically and fiscally by airlines, \" cohen said in a press release announcing the act on monday. \"shrinking seat sizes isn't just a matter of comfort but safety and health as well. \" he argues cramped seating could slow evacuation efforts in the event of emergencies and increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis in passengers. Cohen plans on pitching the seat act as an amendment to the faa reauthorization bill, which the house transportation and infrastructure committee is scheduled to vote on thursday. The amendment \" faces long odds \" to actually becoming law, according to usa today. Airline passengers have lost about 4 inches of leg room and 1.5 inches of butt room since the 1970s. The smaller seats have allowed airlines to fit more passengers on board while making planes lighter to save on fuel costs.",

        "summary": "President trump's personal lawyer, michael cohen, got a restraining order against stormy daniels last month in an attempt to keep the adult film star from speaking out about her alleged 2006 affair with trump, the new york times reports. The temporary feb. 27 order, obtained in a private arbitration meeting with a retired judge, prohibits daniels ( whose real name is stephanie clifford ) from discussing \" confidential information \" related to the nondisclosure agreement she signed in oct. 2016, nbc news reports. Daniels ' lawyer tells nbc that cohen has continued to make efforts to silence daniels via \" threats \" and \" intimidation \" since the order was procured, warning her she is subject to damages should she talk. In her lawsuit against trump attempting to have the nda declared invalid, filed tuesday, daniels refers to a \" bogus, \" \" improper and procedurally defective arbitration proceeding hidden from public view, \" the ap reports. Cohen's own attorney says the nda daniels signed included an arbitration clause with permission to \" seek an injunction in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the agreement, \" and that \" the designated judge from the arbitration tribunal found that ms. Clifford had violated the agreement and enjoined her from, among other things, filing [ her lawsuit against trump ]. \" also wednesday, white house rep sarah huckabee sanders said that trump denies \" all of these allegations \" — both the affair and any knowledge of cohen's $ 130,000 payment to daniels — and that \" this case [ has ] already been won in arbitration. \" her exact meaning was not clear, as trump is not listed as a party on the restraining order, and cnn's chris cillizza notes several of sanders ' \" non-answers \" skirt the issue of whether trump knew about the hush money. If all of this seems a lot to wrap your head around, you're not alone; slate calls it \" convoluted to the point of paradox. \"",

And so he held a \" living funeral \" last weekend, per the cbc, and the \" taking it to the grave \" event was a testament to the \" ebullient performance-art lover, \" as the toronto star puts it. What made the pre-death memorial service for the manitoba native especially unique: henderson listened to complete strangers spill their deepest secrets, then had those secrets tattooed onto his body in the form of specially designated symbols. Henderson died wednesday at the age of 28, just a few days after he was inked up with everyone's revelations. Per the star, the show was to include a giant champagne bottle for henderson to sit in, as well as a manicure bar and \" cuddle spaces \" so that visitors could \" rest in peace. \" but the draw of the combination macabre/motivational happening was the ability to whisper one's secrets to henderson, who then had a toronto tattoo artist translate those secrets to symbols on his skin. A friend says henderson had been studying up on death rituals and says she was glad to be able to help him use his performance art to prepare for the end of his life. \" i've never personally seen someone engage with their own mortality in this way, \" henderson's production manager adds.

A california team searching for the masterpiece battle of anghiari are convinced it's painted on a wall of the palazzo vecchio — behind another painting by giorgio vasari. They sampled the chemical content of the red, black and beige paint beneath vasari's fresco, and discovered it matched the paint used on the mona lisa and da vinci's st. John the baptist, reports abc news. An unusual red lacquer typically used for oil painting is also consistent with da vinci's plan to do his battle painting in oil, notes researcher maurizio seracini, a professor at uc-san diego. Though much work remains to be done, \" the evidence suggests we are searching in the right place, \" he said. Other experts are not so convinced, reports the washington post, and call seracini's claims \" propaganda, \" though the mayor of florence is certain the painting is hidden behind vasari's. Da vinci began painting battle on anghiari in 1505, but stopped a year later when he left florence. Vasari's battle marciano in val di chiana was painted in 1563 in the palazzo vecchio when the hall of the 1500s was being remodeled. Da vinci's painting was thought to be destroyed then. But seracini discovered spaces behind vasari's painting, and began to suspect that the da vinci was still on the real wall underneath a kind of false front made for the newer fresco. Vasari himself may have left a tantalizing clue. One of his painted soldiers holds a flag reading: \" he who seeks, finds. \"",

        "summary": "American support for the war in afghanistan has reached an all-time low, according to the latest new york times/cbs poll. Some 69 % of those polled believe the us shouldn't be fighting in afghanistan, up from 53 % just four months ago. Support has plunged among both democrats and republicans, with 68 % of democrats and 60 % of republicans saying the war is going somewhat or very badly, according to the poll, which is consistent with several other recent surveys. Nato plans to hand over security to afghan forces by the end of 2014. But 47 % of those polled want the us to leave the country ahead of schedule, and only 17 % believe the us should stay for as long as it takes to stabilize the country. A military expert at the brookings institution blames the poll numbers on a lack of awareness of the us policy of slowly turning parts of the country over to afghan forces. \" the overall image of this war is of us troops mired in quicksand and getting blown up, and arbitrarily waiting until 2014 to come home, \" he says. \" of course you'd be against it. \"",

The kids used pickapeppa sauce. 2-3 slices per person? nah, o for at least 4!! yumyumyumyumyum!!!! the debate over how well cooked bacon should be.... That is a personal preference &amp; will never be answered any more than which is better - pepsi or coke? ( btw, pepsi is worlds better! ) i like my bacon somewhat soft but cooked it a bit further for sandwich purposes. Who cares? it's delicious! just eat it!! thanks, ft!",

James clapper's intent with directive 119 is to eliminate leaks of classified information and thus make the country safer. Instead, this bone-headed directive — which makes even the discussion of non-classified information off-limits — will do just the opposite, writes jack shafer at reuters. One big problem is that the move \" increases the insularity of the national security state, \" and insularity can be a dangerous thing. Instead of healthy debates about national security, we get an ever-shrinking circle of yes-men decision-makers. \" one excessively ingrown presidential administration, as you may recall, acted on its excessively ingrown intelligence information and analysis to invade a foreign land to capture diabolical biological and chemical weapons that didn't exist, \" writes shafer.

Events planned in cities around italy ( including rome ) on fertility day will include state-sponsored events where locals will be bombarded with baby-friendly propaganda about family planning, specifically about expanding families, per quartz.

Fertility does. \" and a pamphlet shows two cheerful white couples with the caption \" good habits to promote, \" while the caption \" bad company to leave behind \" is accompanied by a photo of a black woman apparently smoking pot, while a white woman hangs out with a black man who's drinking.

        "summary": "The oldest tree at the white house is set to be taken down later this week, bringing to an end a piece of americana that's been in place in dc since the mid-1800s. Per cnn, the jackson magnolia, one of several magnolias on the presidential grounds, has been the subject of efforts over the years to keep it strong and healthy, but federal arborists were recently brought in and found \" the overall architecture and structure of the tree is greatly compromised, \" according to national arboretum documents. The only thing keeping the tree erect, in fact, are the cables put in place to hold it up, and that cable system is now starting to falter. A white house official says first lady melania trump made the call to cut the tree down after seeing the paperwork, which says the magnolia's woes may have started as long as 50 years ago. \" we believe eventually, the tree will fail, \" tree inspectors now write in their report. The magnolia has a love story behind it, though a bittersweet one. Just over a month after andrew jackson won the 1828 presidential election, his wife, rachel, died, of an illness jackson swore was exacerbated by attacks from his political foes. The new widower is said to have brought with him to washington a sprout from one of rachel's favorite magnolias on their tennessee plantation, though when exactly it was planted at the white house is murky. Per the oakridger, the sapling may have grown in various conservatories before arriving in dc, taking root at the white house as late as 1835. The white house plans to take a piece of the magnolia and plant it where the original stood. Cnn and the oakridger detail events that have taken place near the tree and past presidents who've enjoyed it.",

Chinese authorities swiftly removed nyima and installed government-backed gyaincain norbu to the religious and political position. The role of the panchen lama is the second most senior monk in tibetan tradition, and gyaincain norbu remains an unsatisfactory candidate to many tibetans who consider nyima's detention a tragedy. \"please know that i think about you every day, and as each year passes, my resolve to find you and restore you to your rightful role becomes stronger, \" the head of the us commission on international religious freedom wrote in an open letter to the missing panchen lama.

        "summary": "It's a moon jellyfish free-for-all on central florida beaches. An unusually large swarm of jellyfish have stung an estimated 1,200 beach-goers over four days in volusa county. Jellyfish are not unusual in the area. Winds and currents push them ashore once or twice a year, volusia county spokeswoman captain tamra malphurs says. But the volume is unusual. Tonya kronk of daytona beach was among the unlucky. She took her body board out past a sandbar, and \"it wasn't five minutes before i got stung, \" she tells cnn. \" it just kinda stuck to my leg … and i couldn't get it off fast enough. \" the injuries were \" pretty bad, \" she says. Scientists aren't certain if jellyfish blooms, which occur about every 20 years, are becoming more common. But zoologist allen collins tells fox that warmer oceans, commercial fishing, agricultural runoff, and artificial reefs may be at least partly to blame. Malphurs believes the uptick in stings on florida beaches is probably due to the rising numbers of people using the beach rather than a change in temperature or weather. If you get stung, a marine biologist at the south carolina aquarium recommends applying vinegar to the tentacles before trying to remove them. And it might help to keep in mind that jellyfish serve a useful purpose. Fish, birds, and crabs feed on them, and they provide shelter for juvenile fish. ( moon jellyfish shocked scientists with this feat. )",

A series of underground tubes will transport beer from the de halve maan brewery at the center of bruges, belgium, to a bottling plant a couple miles away. \" it all started as a joke, \" brewer xavier vanneste tells the wall street journal. But, four years after work began, the pipeline is just weeks away from completion. The project was \" born of environmental and quality of life concerns, \" vanneste told afp in an earlier story. Beer has been brewed at de halve maan's historic site for some five centuries. The bottling end of the operation was moved to an industrial area in 2010, creating traffic issues. The pipeline will eliminate some 500 truck trips through the city's narrow, cobblestone alleyways each year. Unfortunately, rumors notwithstanding, in-home taps aren't an option for locals. Once complete, the pipeline ( a \" willy wonkian approach \" to the traffic problem, per the independent ) will transport 1,500 gallons of beer per hour at 12mph. The $ 4.5 million project was, in part, crowdfunded, with donors receiving lifetime supplies of beer ( one 11 ounce bottle per day or one 25 ounce bottle per year, depending on the donation amount ). A local restaurateur who contributed calculated that he would regain his investment, via beer, in 15 years. But, he tells the journal, he would have preferred a direct tap to his establishment: \" it would have saved me a lot of keg-dragging. \" the mayor of bruges is now considering pipelines to transport all kinds of things, including chocolate. As for concerns that scofflaws may try to illegally tap the beer line, which is buried at depths of six to 100 feet, vanneste says the polyethylene tubes are stronger than steel. But, the brewer promises, the flavor of its beers will be unaffected. ( bieber's beer bong encounter ended badly. )",

The cold wave abruptly pushed temperatures to a 16-year low of 39 degrees fahrenheit in the subtropical capital where most homes lack central heating, causing heart trouble and shortness of breath for many of the victims, a city official says. \" in our experience, it's not the actual temperature but the sudden drop that's too sudden for people's circulatory systems, \" a city spokesman says. The cold front also left 3.5 inches of snow on taipei's highest peak saturday and stranded vehicles as people headed into the mountains to see the snow. The same polar front closed schools monday in hong kong, where temperatures fell to 34 degrees fahrenheit, the lowest in nearly 60 years, the bbc reports. Over the weekend, \" frost chasers \" headed to the territory's highest peaks, and more than 200 of them, many suffering from hypothermia, had to be rescued by firefighters, reports the hong kong free press. ( in the us, the weekend blizzard may be followed by a baby boom. )",

        "summary": "Archaeologists have made quite the find off the coast of sicily: a monolith that dates back about 10,000 years. It's broken in two now and on its side, but the block would have stood nearly 40 feet tall in its heyday, before a massive flood submerged it ( along with its home island ) some 9,500 years ago. The find is intriguing because of its age, explains a post at evoanth. It predates \" civilization as we know it, \" but the monolith clearly would have required a large number of people working on it — it weighs an estimated 15 tons — suggesting \" they were already shifting towards our modern way of life. \" indeed, the researchers write, \" the monolith found, made of a single, large block, required a cutting, extraction, transportation, and installation, which undoubtedly reveals important technical skills and great engineering. \" as with stonehenge, the monolith's purpose is unclear, but archaeologists are certain it's manmade because of the work that went into it — including three holes of similar size, \" one at its end which passes through from part to part, the others in two of its sides.... There are no reasonable known natural processes that may produce these elements, \" they write in the journal of archaeological science. One of the researchers tells discovery it might have been part of a lighthouse or an \" anchoring system \" of some kind. More hunts at similar areas in the mediterranean could shed more light on the origins of civilization there, he adds. ( another new archaeological find drawing comparisons to stonehenge is in britain. )",

            "This amber and a gold earring from burial of a lady close to stonehenge shows the detailed decoration on other bronze age artifacts from the time of stonehenge. More: stonehenge intricate treasures made by children although the purpose of the gold lozenge remains a mystery — interpretations have ranged from an elaborate button to an astronomical instrument -- its precise decorations, made of impressed lines, reveals a detailed knowledge of mathematics and geometry. On the chest of the bush barrow tribal chief there was a beautifully decorated gold lozenge. It was made of sheet gold with finely incised decoration. Some of the thousands of studs from the dagger. Each stud is thinner than a human hair. They were set into the wood at a density of over 1,000 per square centimeter to create a zig-zag pattern. Produced nearly 4,000 years ago, more than 1,000 years before the invention of any form of magnifying glass, the dagger was decorated with 140,000 tiny studs. The ultra-fine craftwork entailed extremely tiny components such as microscopic gold pins and gold wires. According to optic experts, only children and teenagers, and those adults who had become myopic naturally or due to the nature of their work as children, would have been able to create and manufacture such tiny objects. The eye-stressing work would have blinded most child workers. The image shows how the studs are placed",

Nashoba brook bakery was taken to task by the agency over its inclusion of \" love \" as one of the ingredients in its nashoba granola. In a sept. 22 letter to ceo john gates and head baker stuart witt that outlines a slew of violations related to sanitation, the fda also called out the bakery's use of the word \" love \" as an ingredient. It reads, \" ingredients required to be declared on the label or labeling of food must be listed by their common or usual name. \" and, in case you were wondering, \" ' love ' is not a common or usual name of an ingredient, and is considered to be intervening material because it is not part of the common or usual name of the ingredient. \" gates described the situation as \" just...

Case in point: not long ago, jaxa steered the akatsuki satellite to orbit around venus after it went adrift for five years. Jaxa could try solving the hitomi mystery by tracing the paths of those five space objects to see \" when the collision actually occurred, \" says jah, though wired calls the idea of an asteroid striking it \" on its first day of work \" a \" crazy coincidence \" ( maybe hitomi just blew up ). Sadly, the high-resolution spectrometer on board to measure x-rays was ruined on two earlier japanese missions, damaged on launch in 2000 and crippled by a helium leak in 2005, nature reports.

It is hoped elisa will launch by the mid 2030s.

In fact, a small one between 5 and 25 meters across will come relatively close to earth sunday night, though there's no danger of a strike. Once an asteroid is detected, scout coordinates data from multiple telescopes across the world in order to ascertain if the object will enter earth's atmosphere, and if it poses any sort of a threat. While more than 15,000 near-earth objects have been recorded over the course of history, astronomers say many, many more pass by undetected. This year alone, scientists have discovered more than 1,500 neos, the christian science monitor reports. That number doesn't mean that the end of days is coming — it just means scientists are getting better at detecting and monitoring objects that come into our celestial neighborhood. While the new \" scout \" system looks at smaller objects, nasa's older, heavy-duty \" sentry \" system looks for big, far-away asteroids which might pose a threat to earth.

Incredibly, this pit may also be the only known dinosaur graveyard dating back to their destruction 66 million years ago, the new york times reports. \" it sounds silly, but is it the case that this pit in south jersey, behind lowe's, has the one window into this pivotal moment in time? \" asks kenneth lacovara, who teaches geology and paleontology at rowan university. The pit, which was in a shallow sea on the dinosaurs ' last day, happens to contain a host of fossils about 40 feet down — which puts it around the \" extinction layer \" marked by an element found in comets and asteroids called radioactive iridium. \" we are in the trying-to-poke-holes-in-it phase, \" says lacovara. \" certainly we have rocks that are near that time. I know we're damned close. \" owned by a water treatment plant for nearly a century, it became unprofitable due to environmental regulations and was slated to become a lake — until rowan, pressed by lacovara, bought it for $ 1.95 million, the star-ledger reported in september. Now lacovara wants even more school trips and fossil days so enthusiasts can search through the muck in mantua township, nj. \" we really want to integrate this in the community, \" he says. \" kids start to think of science as a process.
