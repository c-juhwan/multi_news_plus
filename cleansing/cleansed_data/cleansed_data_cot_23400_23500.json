The washington post reports that startup ozma records is poised to begin shipping copies of the famed golden record that nasa sent into space aboard the two voyager spacecrafts in 1977. The original records, made of copper and coated in gold to withstand the rigors of space, contain the music of berry, beethoven, and others, along with various greetings and animal sounds from earth. The company is accepting orders now at $ 50, and it expects to start shipping in january. A three-lp box set follows in february, notes mixmag. ( listen to the \" sounds of earth \" portion here. ) \" this is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts, and our feelings, \" then-president jimmy carter wrote in a message accompanying the records. \" we are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. \" the aliens would need to be pretty handy, however: nasa didn't send along a device on which to play the records. ( ozma first conducted a successful kickstarter campaign with the goal of making the record available to the public. )",

Tim scott, a south carolina republican, has announced that he has decided to oppose the nomination of thomas farr to be a judge in the eastern district of north carolina, meaning the nomination is probably doomed, the hill reports. Republican sen. Jeff flake joined 49 democrats in voting against moving the nomination forward wednesday, leaving pence to cast the deciding vote after a 50-50 tie. The district court seat farr was nominated for has been open since 2005. Republicans rejected two of barack obama's nominees, both of them african-american women. Scott — the only black republican in the senate — cited concerns about farr's work for the 1990 re-election campaign of republican sen. Jesse helms, in which tens of thousands of black voters received postcards that the justice department considered an attempt to intimidate them from voting. Democrats and the naacp have spoken out against farr for his work defending discriminatory state laws, the ap reports. Farr \" has been involved in the sordid practice of voter suppression for decades and never should have been nominated, let alone confirmed to the bench, \" says senate minority leader chuck schumer. \" thankfully, he won't be. \" ( last year, another judicial nominee withdrew his name after video emerged of him failing to answer basic legal questions. )",

Three escort services tried to fight it, but it was upheld in september. In hawaii, it just recently became illegal for police officers to have sex with prostitutes. In florida, it's illegal for unmarried couples to live together in sin. Adultery is also illegal there, and one woman actually got her husband arrested for cheating in 2006. But lawmakers moved to get rid of the laws earlier this year. Another state where adultery is illegal: new york, where a woman was arrested in 2010 after having sex on a picnic table in a park. The arresting officer happened to know she was married, so she ended up getting charged with adultery in addition to public lewdness. In nebraska, you can't get married if you have gonorrhea, according to this handy roundup of state-by-state sex laws.

        "summary": "It was \" the titanic of its time. \" a luxury steamboat carrying some of the wealthiest and most high-profile families in the southeast exploded while traveling from savannah, ga., to baltimore, md. On june 13, 1838. Half of the roughly 200 people aboard the pulaski died — including whole families and a us congressman from new york, reports the charlotte observer. Divers now believe they've found the 180-year-old wreck site, says keith webb of blue water ventures. It's partnering with endurance exploration — which the tampa bay business journal reports is also trying to search for a wreck in the indian ocean — and says the pulaski lies beneath 115 feet of water 40 miles off the coast of north carolina. There's not a trace of wood left. But a 30-foot by 60-foot debris pile includes two copper boilers, one blown apart, the other split. That's just how survivors described the state of the pulaski's boilers after the explosion, which reportedly caused the boat to sink in 45 minutes, webb says. \" in my mind, there is no doubt this is the wreck of the pulaski. \" in addition to spanish and us silver coins dated before the pulaski's demise, they've found a straight razor, brass key, candlestick holder, and turkey platter. As \" it's one of the more significant disasters in american maritime history, \" joseph schwarzer of the north carolina maritime museums says \" finding the pulaski is a big deal. \" but he would like to see the ship's bell, boiler plate numbers, or some other definitive evidence. Webb hopes to find it. Per a press release, dives at the site will continue through the winter if the weather allows. ( the last american slave ship might also be found. )",

Mayor karen weaver tells the new york times there are still 20,000 lead-tainted pipes in flint, with 6,000 expected to be removed by the end of the year. It could take three years for all pipes to be replaced, reports mlive. \" once those lead pipes are replaced … then hopefully the people of flint will regain the trust that has been shattered in their drinking water, \" a pediatrician who helped expose the water crisis tells the washington post, describing federal lead limits as \" weak. \" for now, \" it is nowhere near the end of the story. \" under a judge's order, officials are required to check that flint residents have water filters properly installed.

Officials acknowledge that the animals are living in the facilities, but they have rejected calls to investigate the situation at the vdnkh exhibition center, where, rt reports, the orcas have been for 10 months. The facility, activists say, is just over 200 feet long; free orcas may swim more than 90 miles per day. \" this is a huge stress that could make them dangerous, \" says irina novozhilova, the head of animal activist group vita. What's more, within concrete walls, the orcas could be deafened by their own echolocation. A police report says the conditions don't amount to animal abuse, which has a very limited definition in russia, the moscow times notes. The animals — a female named narnia and a male with no name — are set to appear in europe's largest oceanarium, which was supposed to open this spring; instead, thanks to construction delays, it's likely to open next year.

Authorities have now disclosed that his brother, khalid el bakraoui, was being sought in connection with last year's paris attack, reports the new york times. Both brothers became suicide bombers on tuesday, and the intelligence failures have prompted what the guardian calls \" soul searching \" in belgium, which has been criticized by some of its european allies for what one french minister called a \" lack of will \" in dealing with islamic extremists. Belgium's justice and interior ministers have offered to resign over the intelligence failures, but prime minister charles michel has refused to accept the resignations. Sources tell reuters that the brothers were on a us watch list, and it's not clear whether american authorities shared information on them with their european union counterparts. The wall street journal reports that while belgium has come under fire for failures, the eu as a whole has been struggling to implement intelligence-sharing plans, with an initiative to track potential terrorists traveling by air held up by european parliament concerns about privacy.

Unfortunately for jack warner, former vice president of fifa and member of parliament in trinidad, that means avoiding what cnn calls a \" spectacular public relations own-goal \": gathering evidence from satirical paper the onion. The 72-year-old, one of several current and former fifa officials arrested last week, defended himself in a video statement posted online yesterday, citing an onion article as supposed proof of an american conspiracy, the new york times reports. Holding a printed copy of the piece from last week, which said fifa had added a 2015 summer world cup in the us to appease officials after the corruption raid, warner criticized the us for accepting the right to host the games \" from the very same organization that they are accusing of being corrupt. That has to be double standards. \" the video was removed later in the day, replaced by an edited version that cut all mention of the onion article; the original video has since been posted by others on youtube. Warner — who left fifa in 2011 amid a bribery scandal, the washington post reports — went on to say american officials who led the raid on fifa bosses were driven by the loss of the country's bid to host the 2022 world cup to qatar, \" a small country, an arabic country, a muslim country. \" he continued, \" i could understand the us embarrassment, \" but the us should \" take your losses like a man. \" finally getting to the charges against him, he added, \" at the end of the day, all of the allegations against me shall be proven to be unfounded. \" he also thanked his supporters and, randomly, \" ann-marie, who sent me breakfast on thursday morning. \" ( click for more on the corruption scandal. )",

Flex is a single-use menstrual cup that can be worn for up to 12 hours without the risk of toxic shock syndrome. It's also hypoallergenic and latex-free, and can help \" alleviate cramps. \" because the discs collect menstrual fluid while being worn next to the cervix instead of in the vaginal canal, flex says they can be worn during intercourse for \" mess-free period sex. \" \" women spend almost a quarter of their lives menstruating, and if we can help make women feel even slightly less ashamed about her body during this time, we've accomplished our mission, \" flex explains.

        "summary": "Parts of what john allen chau wrote over the last days of his life were shared in the wake of his death at the hands of a tribe on a remote island off india. On friday, police officials shared what the new york times describes as \" part letter, part journal, in 13 pages with many cross-outs and messy scrawl. \" it's variously emotive and mundane, including things like directions and details of the exercises he did, and he reportedly told the fisherman who brought him near north sentinel island to pass it to a friend should something happen to him. The times has excerpts, and the writings tell more of what he brought to the tribe — scissors, safety pins, and fishing line — and how he attempted to communicate with them. Chau wrote that he sang worship songs and responded to the yells of one man, who was bedecked with a white, flower-like crown, by saying some words in xhosa that he had picked up while in south africa. \" they would often fall silent after this, \" he wrote. On other occasions, they laughed. At one point he questioned whether the island was \" satan's last stronghold. \" when the fisherman again brought him near the island on nov. 16, he told them he planned to stay overnight, so they left him for the first time. On their pass by the island the next morning, they saw his body being dragged by a rope. The letter's last lines: \" please do not be angry at them or at god if i get killed. I love you all. \" the ap reports a second boat expedition involving police; forest department, tribal welfare department, and coast guard officials; and two of the people who helped chau approach the island went near it on friday in an attempt to locate where chau died.",

The 6-year-old granddaughter of a rich cattle baron would be found alive in a wooden and metal cage in the sun-baked desert 19 days later. How she got there was a mystery that was never solved, despite the efforts of the fbi and local sleuths. The new york times recently discovered that the girl who captured hearts describing on tape how her kidnappers fed her cookies in her underground tomb had died quietly on sept. 2, 2014, at age 87, apparently from complications from parkinson's disease. No obituary was written. A spare death notice in the arizona daily star said june birt, who stayed mostly out of the spotlight the rest of her life, was married to dan birt for 64 years and had four children. June's kidnapping changed life forever in the once-peaceful outpost of tucson. The kidnappers initially demanded a ransom of $ 15,000, later reduced to $ 10,000. June's wealthy grandfather, bernabe robles, strangely refused to contribute, though he feared he would be the next target, per the tucson weekly. No ransom was ever paid. A crude map tucked in an envelope postmarked from chicago eventually led searchers to the area where june was found in a dirt pile covered in scrub. Below was an underground cage. \" i was sure june was dead, \" her uncle carlos robles tells times. The girl was dirty, covered with ant bites, and chafed from ankle chains. But june remembered her report card was left behind in her prison and asked to go back for it. \" i wanted my mama to see it, \" she said.

His ankles and other parts of his body looked puffy, says us ambassador tom armbruster, and he seemed generally healthy. So is the story true? the guardian shares details from mexican officials that lend some credibility: a boat with two fishermen did indeed go missing after setting out from costa azul on november 17, 2012. The names cited in the official report are cirilo vargas and ezekiel córdova. The latter is seemingly a match with that of his dead companion. As for the former, the ap reports that, according to his family, \" cerilo \" was alvarenga's childhood nickname. Further, cirilo vargas was said to be from el salvador, where alvarenga was born. But according to the report, both were 38; alvarenga says he's 37 and his partner was a teenager. But errors often appear in such reports, the guardian notes. National geographic speaks to an expert on human survival: \" the bottom line is that this man's story is plausible, \" the expert says, though he notes that alvarenga \" would have lost a lot of weight. \"",

It's been dubbed the \"viagra condom, \" but that's not entirely accurate. The new product is lined with a vasodilating gel, which increases blood flow to the penis and helps maintain erection. But unlike the pill, it's not designed for men who have erectile dysfunction; rather, it's meant for men who have trouble keeping erections specifically while using a condom. ( more on time.com: \"5 little-known truths about american sex lives \" ) csd500 was developed by futura medical and licensed to the durex brand, which is owned by consumer-products company reckitt benckiser. The product is close to regulatory approval in the u.k. And may be on the market within the year, according to an article in the wall street journal. If the manufacturer seeks fda approval to market the condom in the u.s., it will have to provide more clinical trial data. The csd500 is certainly an innovative idea, not least because it targets male users. Most advances in birth control — like hormone patches or pills — are geared toward women. And many men would probably agree that the stalwart but lowly condom has been long overdue for an upgrade. ( more on time.com: \"sex and self-esteem: a big boost for men, not so much for women \" ) so how does futura's new invention work? the trick was getting the gel to stay put inside the condom, so that it would not affect the condom-wearer's partner. According to the journal: finding an active ingredient was straightforward — it's a generic compound for the treatment of angina, a severe chest pain caused by lack of blood flow to the heart. However, \"immobilizing \" the gel in the condom, so the vasodilator only touches the wearer during sexual intercourse, was the clever part. \"the challenge is having a stable product in a condom — a gel that doesn't do anything detrimental to the condom, \" futura chief executive james barder said. \"some products can degrade the latex very quickly, \" said mr. Barder, noting that adding the vasodilator to the lubricant is complicated. \"it has to be immobilized in the condom."

According to the journal: finding an active ingredient was straightforward — it's a generic compound for the treatment of angina, a severe chest pain caused by lack of blood flow to the heart. However, \"immobilizing \" the gel in the condom, so the vasodilator only touches the wearer during sexual intercourse, was the clever part. \"the challenge is having a stable product in a condom — a gel that doesn't do anything detrimental to the condom, \" futura chief executive james barder said. \"some products can degrade the latex very quickly, \" said mr. Barder, noting that adding the vasodilator to the lubricant is complicated. \"it has to be immobilized in the condom."

Instead, the 93-year-old, speaking after his own zanu-pf party fired him as leader, promised to preside over a party congress set for next month, reuters reports. Mugabe, flanked by generals during a 20-minute televised speech, said the events of the previous days, including an army takeover, didn't pose \" a challenge to my authority as head of state and government. \" the party earlier said it would launch impeachment proceedings if he didn't resign by noon monday, a deadline that has now passed. According to fergal keane, the bbc's africa editor, mugabe apparently decided to resign but then changed his mind. Keane says the military appears to have decided to let the impeachment process take its course instead of forcing mugabe out. Emmerson mnangagwa, the vice president whose firing led to the army takeover, was elected as the party's new leader during its central committee meeting sunday. The 75-year-old, nicknamed \" the crocodile \" for his shrewd and ruthless ways, is believed to have now returned to zimbabwe from abroad, the ap reports.

The movie follows harding's life from her early days skating to the aftermath of the infamous 1994 attack on rival nancy kerrigan, an attack she has long denied involvement in. \" america, they want someone to love.

Robbie, who grew up in australia, told an interviewer earlier this year that she was only four years old when the scandal was in the news, and when she read the script for i, tonya, she initially believed it was pure fiction. The movie, which also stars sebastian stan as ex-husband and kerrigan attack mastermind jeff gilooly, will open in new york and los angeles and dec. 8, with a wider release scheduled for jan. 19.",

Native kids were separated from their families and forced to attend church-run schools so they could learn european ways, reports the globe and mail. Because many of the schools were catholic, the report says the pope should issue an apology. It also for the first time puts a number to the students who died while attending the schools — 3,201, reports the new york times. Physical abuse ( it was \" rampant \" ), disease, and neglect were common causes. If that weren't bad enough, the government decided that returning dead children to their families for burial would be too expensive, and so it buried them in makeshift cemeteries, often in unmarked graves and sometimes with more than one student to a grave. The government apologized for the schools in 2008, and the new report lists 94 recommendations to repair relations, reports the cbc, including the adoption of the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. \" non-aboriginal canadians hear about the problems faced by aboriginal communities but they have almost no idea how those problems developed, \" writes report chair justice murray sinclair. \"this has left most canadians with the view that aboriginal people were and are to blame for the situations in which they find themselves as though there were no external cause. \"",

Two masked gunmen brandishing assault-style weapons sought out and killed thomas, a former member of saginaw's sunny side gang, at that halfway house monday night, reports mlive. \" they were looking for this person, \" a michigan state police officer says, describing the shooting as execution-style. One gunman shot thomas numerous times, while the other held 23 others at gunpoint; ultimately, no one else was injured. \" i think it was connected one way or another to the gang he was from or a rival gang, \" the officer tells michigan radio. The suspects are still at large. Thomas had been sentenced to 19 years in prison in 2008 for distributing cocaine after a federal investigation that authorities thought had put an end to the sunny side gang. Thanks to obama commuting his sentence, he had been scheduled to go free in march, about eight years earlier than his original release date. \" he was just happy to...

The films catapulted chris pratt to stardom and were major wins for disney, raking in a combined $ 1.6 billion, but walt disney studios chairman alan horn didn't mince words: \" the offensive attitudes and statements discovered on james'twitter feed are indefensible and inconsistent with our studio's values, and we have severed our business relationship with him. \" fox news reports the tweets were posted prior to the franchise's start, between 2008 and 2011, and were surfaced thursday by the daily caller and other conservatives. Fox reports those who dug them up were angered by mocking comments gunn apparently made about conservative pundit ben shapiro while ( this gets somewhat convoluted ) coming to the defense of the liberal actor mark duplass, who had himself been criticized for encouraging liberal fans to follow shapiro to hear his views.

The sentence rounded out a roughly decade-long back-and-forth between the 30-year-old musician and common pleas judge genece brinkley that has dogged mill's career as he'd been jailed and called to court multiple times on various infractions, reports the ap. \" i've been trying to help you since 2009, \" brinkley said, citing a failed drug test, failure to comply with a court order restricting his travel, and two other arrests for reckless driving and assault. \" you basically thumbed your nose at me. \" the sentence came after a prosecutor recommended that mill not be imprisoned for the violations, saying he has been clean since january and has grown as a person since his original conviction on gun and drug possession charges.

The skull, called lb1, shares a few characteristics with those who have down syndrome today. One, there is facial asymmetry, which is common in those with the genetic disorder, and while the original findings estimated the skull and femur to be too small to belong to modern humans, new sizing estimates suggest it's actually in the range of an individual with down who lived on one of these indonesian islands, reports the new york times. \" are the skeletons from liang bua cave sufficiently unusual to require invention of a new human species? \" one researcher asked penn state news. \" our re-analysis shows that they are not.

( published thursday, aug. 11, 2016 ) a muslim student has filed a lawsuit against the chicago police department, claiming she was accosted by officers who tore her hijab from her face and head. Itemid al-matar was on her way home to celebrate the end of ramadan but was taken to the ground by police while trying to board a chicago transit authority train in an incident that was caught on camera. The student believes police officers thought she was a terrorist. \"her hijab was torn from her face and head, exposing her face to the public contrary to her religious beliefs, \" according to a release from her attorney gregory kulis. Kulis said al-matar was charged with several counts of disorderly conduct but was later found not guilty during a court trial. Al-matar also alleged that while in custody at the police station she was forced to remove her clothing and strip down to her undergarments as photos were taken of her. Chicago police declined to comment, saying it \"cannot comment on pending lawsuits. \"",
            "Muslim woman claims she was 'attacked ' by police, sues this still frame, taken from a cta surveillance video posted on youtube, shows itemid al matar just before she is grabbed and handcuffed by chicago police at the state/lake stop on the loop l. A young muslim woman is suing a group of chicago police officers for religious discrimination over her arrest in a cta stairwell during which the officers allegedly ripped off her hijab. Itemid \"angel \" al matar filed her federal lawsuit thursday against six officers and the city, claiming she also became a victim of cpd's code of silence when she was falsely arrested at the state and lake station on the fourth of july 2015. Her lawyer, gregory kulis, told reporters that police wrongly suspected her of being a \"lone-wolf suicide bomber. \" a youtube video shows several officers tackling al matar as she climbed the cta stairs that day. The arrest blocked the path of other would-be cta riders, who stood and watched a portion of the arrest. Al matar's lawsuit alleges she saw the group of officers point at her, but she walked past them. She said they grabbed her on the stair landing, \"pulling at her and ripping off her hijab. \" a news release from cair-chicago indicates the arrest happened during ramadan, when al matar was \"trying to catch the train to go home to break her fast by sunset. \" she says she committed no crime, and the press release states she was later found not guilty of resisting"

It's similar to the penn state case. \" fitzpatrick died in 2005 at the age of 76. The team settled a $ 3.15 million lawsuit with seven florida men in 2003 who accused fitzpatrick of molesting them during spring training in the 1970s, and fitzpatrick pleaded guilty in 2002 to four counts of attempted sexual battery. The team also paid $ 100,000 to a former clubhouse attendant who charged that he was assaulted during a team trip. This is the first time accusations have involved incidents at fenway park, according to the boston globe. One of the men in the current lawsuit, charles crawford, said fitzpatrick assaulted him twice in 1991 — in a restroom and an equipment room at fenway — when he was a 16-year-old batboy. \"i've held one of boston's darkest secrets all these years, knowing people would have been blown out of their seats if they knew what the red sox let happen to me, \" he said. A red sox attorney said officials were unaware of the incidents in the lawsuit, but that the team has \" always viewed the actions of mr. Fitzpatrick to be abhorrent. \" when the sox became aware of other allegations against fitzpatrick in 1991, the manager was \" promptly relieved of his duties, \" the attorney added. Elsewhere, a brooklyn prep school is accused in a lawsuit of covering up years of sex abuse of athletes by popular coach phil foglietta, now deceased, reports the new york daily news.",

He always had a gang of kids in his green impala, and they always seemed to be on their way to a sporting event or a pizza joint. Wherever he went, former players and rival coaches would line up to shake his hand. David hiltbrand, a talented athlete who showed promise in baseball and football, was in the eighth grade when the coach with the booming voice, beer-keg body and popeye forearms arrived at poly prep's leafy dyker heights campus. Hiltbrand was thrilled when foglietta invited him to spend his free periods in the athletic department offices, a clubhouse away from the rest of the faculty and students. Foglietta, surrounded by a clique that quickly became known as \"foggy's boys, \" would crack jokes, mock other faculty members and make crude remarks about the school's jewish students. \"he made you feel like you were in an exclusive club, \" says hiltbrand, now a 57-year-old entertainment journalist who lives in the philadelphia suburbs. \"i went from nothing, a nobody who got picked on, to someone important.

Yet he's just been schooled by a relative newbie. Google's 2-year-old computer program alphago, built at artificial intelligence lab deepmind, defeated sedol, 33, in the first of five scheduled matches in seoul on wednesday, leaving him \" in shock, \" reports nbc news. Though go has long been thought too complicated for a computer to learn — \" it is primarily a game about intuition rather than brute-force calculation used in chess, \" deepmind's ceo explains — alphago uses reinforcement learning. It studied 100,000 matches, then learned to look for the best moves, reports npr. It defeated the 633rd-ranked go player in october and has improved by playing millions of games against itself. Throughout the 3.5-hour match wednesday, viewers were impressed to see alphago playing much like a human, per wired. The computer matched sedol's pace and often moved on the offensive. It also moved to reinforce weak groups of stones, just as a top player would, says alphago's operator, who physically moved the game pieces. At the same time, alphago made moves \" that could not have been possible for human being to choose, \" sedol says. Despite the loss, humans shouldn't fear a future of robot overlords, eric schmidt of alphabet ( formerly google ) tells zdnet. \" as artificial intelligence and machine learning develop further, each and every person will become smarter and more talented. \" a second match is set for thursday.",

In this lengthy and worthwhile article, he brought together findings from previous researchers who had examined the series, and led in a methodical fashion queries into when the pieces were struck, by whom, and where they were manufactured. The article leaves open several questions, some of which have yet to be resolved. One is the question of which birch the coin refers to. There are two varieties of birch cents: the \"regular \" design has birch on the bust truncation and is represented by 15-20 pieces today ( including both judd-4 and judd-5 ). The other design is a unique white metal specimen with gwpt on the reverse, an abbreviation for \"george washington president. \" as superficially different as these two coins appear, they are actually different engraving states of the same die. The two designs are punch-linked, indicating the same person engraved both at about the same time.

The half disme is virtually a mirror image of the birch cent, with liberty facing left rather than right as on the cent. Carlson's article makes a clear case for the time frame of the striking of these coins from a december 1792 letter written by thomas jefferson. In this letter he implies there were no cents struck in the mint itself before december, which leaves production of these coins to sometime before october, when the mint presses were first operational. This leaves only one possibility for the location of the production of the birch cents: john harper's coach house. The question of just which birch was actually responsible for these pattern cents has since proven to be not thomas birch, previously believed to have engraved the dies. Thomas birch was born in england in 1779 and was only 13 years old in 1792. It is more likely that william russell birch, a famous philadelphia miniaturist, visited philadelphia in the spring and summer of 1792, although he only moved his family there in 1794.

Five hostages have escaped, but authorities, who have been in contact with what is now believed to be a lone gunman, aren't sure how many people remain in the lindt chocolat cafe, cnn reports. Witnesses say there are around 15 hostages and the gunman is forcing them to stand pressed to the cafe glass for two-hour stints, reports 9news, which has been contacted by two hostages to relay the gunman's demands. According to ten eyewitness news, which has also spoken to hostages, the gunman says he has planted four bombs — two in the cafe and two elsewhere in downtown sydney. In other developments: more than 11 hours after the siege began, police say that the gunman is continuing to negotiate with them and have warned against reprisal attacks on muslims, the sydney morning herald reports. \" our plan, our only goal tonight is to get those people who are currently caught in that building out of there, \" new south wales police commissioner andrew scipione told reporters. \" rest assured, we are doing all we can to set you free. \" staff at 7news were able to observe the gunman from their offices. They say the gunman has what appears to be a pump-action shotgun, became \" extremely agitated \" when he realized five hostages had escaped, and the faces of remaining hostages appear \" pained, strained, eyes red and raw. \" a coalition of 40 australian islamic groups has issued a statement expressing \" utter shock and horror at the unprecedented scenes. \" an exclusion zone has been set up around the cafe in the heart of sydney's central business district, and the premier of new south wales says people who normally work there should prepare to work from home tomorrow.",

A while back, the company launched a new advertising campaign called \"sponsored stories \" that incorporated users ' \"likes \" into advertisements. It offered peer endorsement of products and a way for facebook to make money. But the new ad format was a step too far for many individuals, who were concerned about unknowingly having their name woven into an advertisement. A lawsuit that accused facebook of misappropriating users ' images ended with a settlement on monday. The agreement states that the social media site has to pay approximately 614,000 facebook users $ 15 each for using their information for advertising purposes. While approximately 150 million facebook users ' images and likenesses were allegedly used to promote products and services through the sponsored stories program, only users who entered a claim form by may 2, 2013, were eligible to receive settlement funds. It is far from clear that any of the users featured in the advertisements were \"actually harmed in any meaningful way, \" writes us district judge richard seeborg in the statement. \"plaintiffs have repeatedly relied primarily on their argument that facebook benefited, rather than that class members were harmed, \" the settlement reads.

The controversial news comes not from the white house but from palestinian president mahmoud abbas and jordan's king abdullah, who say they tried unsuccessfully to talk trump out the decision. They warned that the policy shift, which would mean moving the us embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem, will not only jeopardize peace talks but unleash violence in the region. Details and developments: the timing: trump was expected to announce the decision wednesday, reports the new york times. However, he was also expected to sign a waiver delaying the embassy move for six months, given the logistics involved. Moving the embassy would fulfill a campaign promise. Abbas, meanwhile, is reaching out to world leaders including vladimir putin and pope francis, hoping they can change trump's mind, per the jerusalem post.",

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analyses from the frontlines of israel, the middle east and the jewish world. Us president donald trump called the leaders of israel, the palestinian authority, jordan and egypt on tuesday to inform them of his intention to move the us embassy in tel aviv to jerusalem, 22 years after the us congress called on the white house to do just that. What trump didn't say, however, was when the move would take place, something that could provide some maneuvering room for him to try to tamp down arab anger over the highly contentious step. \"if mr. Trump comes up and says 'i recognize the united jerusalem to be the capital of the state of israel, ' he [ will ] have destroyed every chance that he will play to get the deal of century, \" shaath told reporters tuesday.

So is the government just glossing over a nightmare experience? to recap the nightmare: the magnitude 7.9 quake on may 12, 2008, left 87,000 people dead or missing, notes afp, and killed an estimated 5,335 children when poorly built schools collapsed. China sent nearly 150,000 troops to the region, and money poured in from corporations and celebrities. But outrage grew as word got out that thousands of schools were shoddily built, possibly due to corruption, and earned the nickname \" tofu schools. \" all criticism of the schools ' construction was silenced and lawsuits were forbidden, reports cnn. But the government's reframing of tragic events to reflect positively on the country is not unusual, says david bandurski, a co-director of the china media project.

        "summary": "Oklahoma is a much shakier place than it used to be and fracking is probably to blame, according to the united states geological survey, which warns that the central part of the state is now at increased risk of a damaging quake. The agency says that there were 183 quakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater in the six months since october alone, compared to an average of just two that size per year between 1978 and 2008, npr reports. A major factor, it says, is probably the injection of waste water from fracking into deep geological formations, causing quakes in a \" process known as injection-induced seismicity. \" the usgs and the oklahoma geological survey rejected theories that the huge increase in quakes could be due to natural fluctuations in the state, which has around 10,000 injection wells, notes the tulsa world. \" we hope that this new advisory of increased hazard will become a crucial consideration in earthquake preparedness for residents, schools, and businesses in the central oklahoma area, \" a usgs spokesman says. \" building owners and government officials should have a special concern for older, unreinforced brick structures, which are vulnerable to serious damage during sufficient shaking. \"",

If that's true, they calculate that it would require 1.08 x 1015 metric tons of steel to build the thing. The good news is that there is actually enough iron on earth to handle that — indeed, there's enough to make 2 billion death stars. The bad news? based on the world's current output it would take 833,315 years to turn enough of that iron into steel, and it would cost the aforementioned $ 852,000,000,000,000,000.

            "While philip's case is unusual, stuttering is not: about 5 percent of people stutter at some point, and about 1 percent stutter as adults, according to the national institutes of health. His classroom experience underlines a perennial complaint among stutterers, that society does not recognize the condition as a disability, and touches on an age-old pedagogical — and social — theme: the balance between the needs of an individual and the good of a group. \"as we do with all students seeking accommodations, we have taken action to resolve philip's concerns so he can successfully continue his education, \" said kathleen brunet eagan, the college's communications director. She would not say if ms. Snyder, who declined to discuss the matter, had been disciplined, but noted that the college \"strives to educate faculty and staff on how to accommodate students. \" ms. Snyder has taught history at the college for a decade, and several current and former students on campus said in interviews that they had largely positive views of her. She was one of the first students when the college opened in 1968, then earned bachelor's and master's degrees at montclair state university, and taught middle school social studies for more than 30 years.

        "summary": "Those snack cakes and chicken nuggets may be tasty, but they may also be upping your chances of cancer, according to a new study out of sorbonne paris cite university. The research published in bmj looked at the consumption of \" ultra-processed \" foods — the bbc has a list of edibles most commonly falling into this category, including mass-produced bread, frozen meals, sweets, and sodas — by 105,000 subjects and found that when the percentage of these ultra-processed foods in diets went up by 10 %, the number of cancers overall similarly rose, by 12 %. Per the guardian, the rate of breast cancer spiked 11 %, while other cancers saw no significant raise. \" if confirmed in other populations and settings, these results suggest that the rapidly increasing consumption of ultra-processed foods may drive an increasing burden of cancer in the next decades, \" the study's authors note. But that further confirmation is needed, as critics cite caveats for the study's results, including the murkiness of what the term \" ultra-processed \" actually encompasses, as well as the scientists ' inability to totally negate other factors that could contribute to cancer risk, such as lack of activity, smoking, and taking birth control pills. Even experts from mexico's national institute of public health say in a bmj editorial on the study that it should be viewed simply as an \" initial insight. \" still, a spokesman for the uk's national obesity forum notes the high levels of fat, salt, and sugar crammed into processed foods in general and thinks people should avoid too much of these foods to begin with. \" there is no smoke without fire: we should heed their fears — and read food labels more carefully, \" he tells the bbc.

        "summary": "As the world's richest and most powerful people leave the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, there was growing discussion about the impact the world's wealthiest could have, single-handedly, on the poverty rates of entire nations. One analyst at the brookings institution crunched some numbers and found that, if the richest resident of three countries — swaziland, colombia, and georgia — distributed half their wealth over the next 15 years to those who live below the poverty line according to how far below it they reside, no one would live below the poverty line in that time. Ditto if multiple billionaires ( as opposed to just one ) in each of six other countries pool their resources. \" this might all seem far-fetched, \" notes quartz, \" but some of the world's richest people are already giving their money away. \" there's the example of bill and melinda gates — who have given away $ 30 billion and have 100 others signed on to donate the majority of their wealth through the giving pledge. Similarly, mark zuckerberg and wife priscilla chan greeted the birth of their daughter with an open letter vowing to give away 99 % of their facebook shares, currently valued at $ 45 billion. The brookings analyst hopes activity like this \" could trigger a powerful demonstration effect of innovative solutions — not just for other billionaires, but for countries that are currently at risk of being left behind. \" the news comes as oxfam international finds that the richest 1 % of the world is just 62 people, and that their combined wealth equals that of the entire bottom half of the rest of the world ( 3.7 billion people and growing ).

Things were going well at first, and the us was happy to stay out of the fight, but that changed when the ground offensive stalled, reports the new york times. Hence, us warplanes began airstrikes against isis positions today, reports the ap, and the initiative is expected to last for days. \" though expected for the better part of a week and unlikely to be coordinated with iran's proxies, the belated introduction of us combat aircraft above tikrit has brought the obama administration to an awkward point it has long dismissed: a tactical, if tacit, alliance with its greatest rival in the middle east, \" writes spencer ackerman at the guardian.

That request was denied — forcing young to take unpaid leave — based on a vague law stating employers must treat pregnant women as they would \" other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work. \" that line is now the focus of a supreme court case that could have major implications for workplace equality, the guardian reports. Ups, which young sued under the federal pregnancy discrimination act, says it acted lawfully by accommodating only workers with on-the-job injuries, but not those who were pregnant or had been injured off the job, the new york times reports. The us government supports young's case, but justices appear to be divided. Ruth bader ginsburg grilled a ups lawyer yesterday, asking for an example of any ups worker other than a pregnant one being denied a lifting dispensation, while elena kagan said the law was intended to ensure pregnant women \" wouldn't be unfairly excluded from the workplace. \" but antonin scalia and stephen g. Breyer seemed to favor ups ' argument, \" on the grounds that ignoring its usual test of whether the impairment was caused in the workplace would unfairly elevate the status of pregnant workers over others — and would conceivably entitle them to all manner of additional benefits, \" writes the guardian.

The concept for snoop dogg's new video for \" lavender \" ( nightfall remix ) -- named after the original badbadnotgood collaboration featuring kaytranada -- came to its director, youtube star jesse wellens, during a smoking session. Sharing the same manager, the prankvsprank sensation and the west coast rap legend were working the same video game event last october. Smoking was not permitted indoors, so the two lit up in the rapper's sprinter van as wellens pitched his idea. It included resident evil dogs, clowns, a commercial for the faux snoop loops cereal, and a timely concept inspired by philando castile -- the falcon heights man who was fatally shot by cops at a traffic stop last july, as seen in the heartbreaking video his girlfriend recorded and posted online. Snoop had promised a song that night, but three days later, sent wellens his take on \" lavender, \" which features him targeting police brutality with lines like, \" trying to keep from dying in these muthaf -- kin'streets/ f -- k the police/ from a black man's point of view. \" snoop, who stumbled upon the badbadnotgood track after his a&r, frank vasquez, had loaded the band's iv record into his itunes, said wellens ' concept and the beat inspired him to express his thoughts candidly. \" i had never had a song like that, so when i got back to the studio, i started skimming through beats, and that particular beat just seemed on the same page to get me going, so i wrote the whole song [ to it ], \" explains the rapper.

            "The court's liberal justices pounded clement with tough questions about the states ' case that congress didn't have the power to expand medicaid. The conservative justices stayed mostly silent during the discussion, but roberts noted that states may have already given up some independence by agreeing to take federal medicaid funds over the past 40 years.

            "Washington — the day after the supreme court suggested that president obama's health care law might be in danger of being held unconstitutional, the justices on wednesday turned their attention to the practical consequences and political realities of such a ruling. The justices seemed divided on both questions before them: what should happen to the rest of the law if the court strikes down its core provision? and was the law's expansion of the medicaid program constitutional? the two arguments, over almost three hours, were by turns grave and",
            "The supreme court closed an extraordinary three-day review of president obama's health-care law wednesday, with its conservative majority signaling that it may be on the brink of a redefinition of the federal government's power. Justices on the right of the deeply divided court appear at least open to declaring the heart of the overhaul unconstitutional, voiding the rest of the 2,700-page law and questioning the underpinnings of medicaid, a federal-state partnership that has existed for nearly 50 years. Much can happen between now and the expected ruling this summer, and",

Jess bravin has details on the news hub. Photo: reuters. Washington — the supreme court ended three momentous days of argument wednesday over the constitutionality of the obama administration's signature health-care law, with opponents pushing their rhetoric into fundamental questions about the limits of washington's power.

        "summary": "California gov. Jerry brown has submitted his $ 113 billion budget proposal, and in it he notes that, on average, 20 new felons are expected to show up per year on death row in san quentin state prison, the los angeles times reports. One problem: there's no more room. With executions at a standstill for almost 10 years and each of the 715 death-row vacancies more or less accounted for, brown is asking for $ 3.2 million out of the budget to expand the facility by opening up almost 100 more cells that have been recently vacated by lower-level criminals in the prison's south block. Although the 20 women on california's death row are housed in a separate maximum-security facility, 708 of the 731 men waiting for their day of reckoning are housed at san quentin; the other 23 are currently in other california prisons for court dates, jailed in other states, or in medical facilities, the times notes. No one's been put to death in california since clarence ray allen in 2006, when the state halted all executions. Sentenced convicts keep filtering in, though, as the state hashes out its capital punishment issues in the courts. A 2010 planned execution was blocked by both state and federal courts due to lethal injection concerns, and a federal judge ruled in 2014 that california's death penalty was \" unconstitutional, \" often leaving inmates languishing for decades, cnn has noted; the cdcr says the average time spent on cali's death row is 17.5 years. The money brown's seeking would go toward staffing, security, and revamping south block facilities, such as making showers shackle-friendly, the times notes. \" until the litigation is resolved, this cost-effective proposal allows [ the state corrections department ] to safely house condemned inmates going forward, \" a corrections department spokesman said last week, per the times.
