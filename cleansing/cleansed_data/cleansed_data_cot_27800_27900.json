        "summary": "Big changes lie ahead at cbs and viacom, where 92-year-old chairman sumner redstone is stepping down amid lawsuits and power struggles. Cbs announced on wednesday that redstone has resigned to become \" chairman emeritus \" and that cbs ceo leslie moonves will take his place, the new york times reports. A source tells the wall street journal that redstone, who controls around 80 % of voting stock in cbs and viacom, will also step down from the latter company, though the decision will not be finalized until a board meeting on thursday. Redstone, who built a $ 39 billion media colossus out of the theater chain his father founded in 1936, had long insisted that he would step down ‚Äî and never die ‚Äî but recent years have seen what the times calls \" shakespearean twists and turns \" over the future of his empire. In a lawsuit brought by ex-girlfriend manuela herzer last year after she was removed from authority over redstone's health decisions, she describes him as a \" living ghost \" with diminished mental capacity. Redstone's lawyers have labeled the ongoing lawsuit a meritless, \" despicable invasion of his privacy. \" the times notes that it has already brought up \" embarrassing \" information about the media mogul's physical deterioration, sexual appetite, and \" obsession with eating steak. \" in another twist, redstone's daughter shari issued a statement wednesday saying that her father wanted her to succeed him but she nominated moonves instead to be a \" leader with an independent voice, \" the ap reports.

Regardless, she rebranded her recipe \" canadian semiaquatic rodent posterior doughnut. \" while it \" doesn't roll off the tongue quite as easily, \" van rosendaal admits the name is growing on her. Not all of her fans on social media felt the same way, and beavertails issued what it calls \" a big canadian sorry \" to van rosendaal. \" if we have ever gone too far during our endeavor to preserve the brand name, we sincerely apologize for this lapse of judgement, \" the company tweeted thursday.

        "summary": "If you crave chocolate after a hard day at work or eat too much junk food when out with friends, your personality may be to blame, according to a new study in the journal appetite. Researchers at switzerland's federal institute of technology compiled 1,000 swiss responses to three questionnaires on eating habits, food choices, and personality, with the latter questionnaire designed to identify one of five basic dimensions of personality: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. \" we found that a person's personality does, in fact, determine why he or she eats and what he or she eats, \" study author carmen keller says. As well, certain characteristics may be \" risk factors \" for an unhealthy diet or lifestyle, and understanding those characteristics could play a key role in \" successful weight management, \" new york adds. Extroverts, who typically exhibit healthy social behavior, may eat more sweets, meats, savory foods, and sugary drinks, the study found. \" it might be that the higher sociability of extroverted people results in having more meals with other people and, therefore, eating foods that are not healthy, \" keller says. Neurotic people tend to eat as a result of negative emotions, while people who aren't conscientious are likely to cave to a delicious smell or taste. Conscientious people tend to eat healthier foods and avoid eating for external or emotional reasons, the stir notes. They're also less likely to overeat. Interestingly, those open to new experiences tend to eat more fruit, veggies, and salads, and consume less meat and soft drinks. Overall, the study finds counting calories may not be enough to maintain a healthy diet. \" identifying ways in which people can boost their capacity to control their eating is the next big challenge in eating research, \" an expert says. ( a psychologist has proposed a no-diet weight loss plan. )",

Rosario signorello, who's spent two years studying what makes for charismatic speech, analyzed 36 speeches from trump, clinton, sanders, and fiorina, according to a press release. He found that politicians sound the same even when what they're saying varies wildly. The los angeles times reports signorello looked at the fundamental frequency, or pitch, of the candidates'speech during political rallies, addresses to politicians, and nonpolitical talk shows. It turns out, all four candidates changed their pitch patterns depending on their audience in pretty much the exact same ways. During political rallies, the candidates used a wide range of frequencies. Signorello tells the atlantic that's because the candidates had to appeal to a diverse crowd. \"at a hillary clinton rally, people might expect a masculine leader, a charming one, others might expect an authoritarian leader, \" he says. But while they're addressing politicians, the candidates used lower pitches. This is a technique used elsewhere in the mammalian world to show dominance. Finally, during talk shows, the candidates tended to use their natural voices with normal pitch ranges. But there were some individual \" quirks. \" clinton and fiorina lowered their natural pitches in front of crowds, while trump raised his. And sanders had the widest range of pitches.

But there were enough details for the 28-year-old anchor to realize that her husband, harsad kawade, was one of the three. She realized that her husband had been traveling in the same model car, a renault duster, on the same road at the time with a group of friends.

        "summary": "While there's a lot of worry about robots replacing american workers, a paper by harvard economist james bessen found automation has made humans obsolete in just one job over the past 67 years. Of 270 occupations listed in the 1950 us census, only elevator operator no longer exists due to automation, quartz reports. Another 32 jobs were done in by a loss of demand, and five became technologically obsolete. And while machines eventually replaced human operators in the country's elevators, it took them a while. According to npr, the automated elevator was invented in 1900, but americans didn't become comfortable with using them for another five decades. While most of today's jobs could be partially automated in the future, it's unlikely many could be completely taken over by machines. Manufacturing and food service face the greatest threat from automation; management and educational services face the least. However ‚Äî and while it's not technically an occupation ‚Äî the american driver could soon go the way of the elevator operator, pc magazine reports. Surveys have found that less than half of us consumers trust self-driving cars and 25 % of us drivers would never ride in one. This sounds an awful lot like the reaction to early automated elevators. In fact, a leading elevator historian calls an elevator without an operator \" the google car of its era. \" ( a robot programmed to avoid humans roams the deserts of california. )",

In her article about the maidu for the bbc, caroline davies visited a distant relative in the maidu town of taylorsville, a frontier village that houses 140 people, with just a hairdresser and general store among the private homes. She made a startling discovery during her trip: only five people in the town still speak the maidu language, they're all between the ages of 87 and 93, and they may not necessarily want their kin to keep speaking it after they're dead. \" those [ who ] know the language don't want to speak it, \" davies ' cousin trina tells her. \" they associate it with difficult times. They don't want to stir up ‚Ä¶ anything. \" the apparent reason for this seemingly counterintuitive decision to let their language die: distrust. As the bbc notes, native americans still harbor unpleasant memories of governmental intervention, including bounties placed on their scalps, bureau of indian affairs-ordered boarding schools in which natives were made to speak english, and the indian removal act, which forced native americans off their land and into poor urban areas, notes the bbc. The maidu may therefore be reluctant to share their sacred knowledge with outsiders. \" if someone misuses the knowledge you give them, if they use it to hurt someone, you as the person who gave it to them, are responsible for that hurt, \" trina explains. Therefore, as davies puts it, the maidu community would perhaps \" rather turn in on themselves than share their culture with a world they distrust. ‚Ä¶ [ it may be seen as ] a noble act of social responsibility by a group protecting itself from the unknown implications of their actions. \" ( listen to what our ancient ancestors may have sounded like. )",

The resident of syracuse, ny ‚Äî and refugee from south sudan ‚Äî decided to enter yahoo's bracket contest for the ncaa basketball tournament, making his picks for the $ 50,000 grand prize, syracuse.com reports. And when he went to the site monday morning to check out how he was doing, he had two surprises waiting: first, out of more than a half-million entries, his \" jahmo syracuse \" handle was tied for first place with two other contestants, and second ( as loads of messages from yahoo users informed him ), because he has a giant \" no pick \" for the eventual winner of the entire tourney next to his name, he has zero chance of actually taking home the money. In a heartbreaking turn, although kiki had assigned 141 points to the last game, he had mistakenly forgotten to fill in the slot for the final victor ‚Äî which deadspin explains isn't that hard to imagine, considering what it calls \" yahoo's somewhat unintuitive picking system \": entrants might not catch a glimpse of the final field all the way at the top of the page, which is apparently different than how the other 62 choices show up in the center. Kiki says his original thought was to pick villanova, but now that there's no cash at stake, he's just going to go for his adopted hometown of syracuse. He hasn't had the heart yet to think about trying his hand at next year's bracket, but if he does, he says he's \" going to make sure everything is saved before i hit submit. \" this isn't the first time this has happened: per deadspin, a \" poor schmo \" lost out on the chance to grab $ 100,000 from yahoo for the same reason two years ago.

Azcentral reports that belen sisa, an undocumented immigrant who came to the us with her parents from argentina at age 6 and stayed even when their visas expired, received over 4,500 reactions to the post. It has since been set to private. Sisa, who is protected from deportation and is lawfully able to work under president obama's deferred action for childhood arrivals ( daca ) policy, wrote that though she paid $ 300 in state taxes in 2016, she isn't entitled to benefits such as financial aid for school. But she says her point wasn't to complain: \" i decided to post it basically to bust the myth that immigrants don't contribute and they don't pay taxes to this country. \" while some responses to sisa's photo were reaffirming, others were threatening. Sisa posted over 30 screenshots of harassing messages from strangers who accused her of voting illegally and lying, while others said they reported her to immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) and hoped she'd be deported. But sisa, an activist who speaks widely on immigration reform, says she is not intimidated. Though she cannot vote, sisa worked as a page at the democratic national convention and volunteered in latino outreach for bernie sanders ' presidential campaign, showing up in this npr story on the latter. In a facebook update on sunday, she wrote, \"they will not tear me down. My heart is too full, my passion to help and fight for others burns too bright.

On a recent friday evening in downtown phoenix, sisa and other volunteers set up a sanders table at the city's monthly art walk.

Sisa first became interested in politics in june 2012 when president barack obama used executive power to create the deferred action for childhood arrivals ( daca ) program, which gave dreamers like her protection from deportation and temporary work permits.

Sisa, a 21-year-old who attends chandler-gilbert community college, is so passionate about the vermont senator and democratic presidential hopeful, she was rooting for him to run for president long before he announced his candidacy. On a recent friday evening in downtown phoenix, sisa and other volunteers set up a sanders table at the city's monthly art walk.

The highlights: an unidentified white house official suggested tuesday night that the us will no longer push for a two-state solution, the idea of creating a sovereign palestinian state that would sit side by side with israel, reports reuters. That has been us policy for about 20 years, notes the ap, though it adds that former president obama in his final news conference acknowledged that the time for a two-state solution \" may be passing. \" the key quote, per the washington post, from the us official, on whether the us would insist on a two-state solution: \"maybe, maybe not. It's something the two sides have to agree to. It's not for us to impose that vision. A two-state solution that doesn't bring peace is not our goal. \" the trump team seems to be moving toward an \" outside-in \" policy, in which it will push arab states such as saudi arabia and egypt to align with israel and put pressure on the palestinians to make concessions, according to an analysis at foreign policy. Its explainer says the idea makes sense but cautions against moving too aggressively on it. The new york times calls the outside-in strategy a \" long shot. \" trump has put son-in-law jared kushner in charge of mideast peace efforts, and the new york times has a profile. It notes that kushner as a jewish teenager met netanyahu more than once ( the pm knows kushner's father ), and that the 36-year-old is now on a \" crash course in diplomacy. \" one thing is clear: after prickly relations with obama, netanyahu's relationship with trump looks like it could be \" especially warm, \" observes an analysis at the atlantic. An analysis at haaretz says netanyahu's biggest issue remains iran, but he won't push trump to dump the us nuclear agreement with tehran, at least not yet.",

In fact, two horses died at the racecourse just this week, one after a fall yesterday and another after a suspected heart attack on thursday, reports the guardian. Consider, too, that a pair of horses ‚Äî including the favorite, synchronised ‚Äî died during last year's grand national, which has had 18 deaths over 20 years. The horses have to jump 30 fences, some more than five feet high, and critics say the races are not only too physically demanding for the animals, but too stressful as well. A growing body of evidence suggests the horses have what the times calls a \" deep-seated fear \" of the fences. Along those lines, the telegraph thinks both deaths this week ultimately resulted from heart attacks. In short, \" the grand national is on trial, \" says an official with the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals.",

He was 88 and suffered dementia. Though 250,000 who arrived at sobibor concentration camp never left, blatt was one of 50 jews to escape in the only mass breakout at a world war ii death camp and live to tell the tale, reports the washington post. Many escapees were rounded up and killed on oct. 14, 1943, but blatt, then 16, convinced a farmer to hide him in a barn for months before the man shot him and left him for dead. With a bullet in his jaw, blatt survived in a forest and eventually became a key witness in the trial of former sobibor guard john demjanjuk. He went on to tell the world of the horrors he witnessed through two books and numerous talks after moving to the us. Blatt told how he was picked, apparently at random, to be a camp laborer while his parents and brother were murdered in one of the camp's recently uncovered gas chambers. He was tasked with shaving women's hair ‚Äî which was then used in military footwear ‚Äî cleaning the blood from officers ' boots, and sorting victims ' clothing. When the war ended, \" i should have danced for joy. Instead, i felt empty and sad and alone, \" blatt wrote. He often returned to sobibor, which he helped preserve, though the nazis had tried to erase all evidence that it existed. \" i ' m still there ‚Äî in my dreams, in everything, \" he said. In 2011, he explained that it wasn't the outcome of demjanjuk's trial that was important. \" at least this trial will ensure that ( sobibor ) goes on the record, because once the survivors and all their relatives are dead, it will be easier for revisionists to say it was a fabrication, that sobibor, in fact even the holocaust, never happened. \"",

First, washington must consider whether nato should install surface-to-air missiles in turkey, which some see as a deterrent to syrian air force attacks near the border. Another possibility: directly arming the rebel forces, instead of supplying weapons through countries like qatar. Recent rebel successes have lent \" a new urgency, and a new focus \" to the debate in washington, says an official. What's more, \" the administration has figured out \" that if it doesn't get involved before the war ends, \" they won't have influence with the fighters, and the fighters will control the territory, \" says a defense expert. In other syria news: if the rebels want western support, they ' ll need a transitional government, and quickly, notes the christian science monitor, and yesterday saw the first meeting of syria's new opposition coalition. \" the objective is to name a prime minister, or at least have a list of candidates ahead of the friends of syria meeting \" that's coming up, says a vice president.

The world economic forum said tuesday that even though last year's guesstimate put gender paycheck equality at around the year 2133, that date has now been pushed back to 2186. Forward movement on this front has slowed down dramatically, or even reversed, in countries around the world, leading the gap back to where it was in 2008, per the swiss organization's annual global gender gap report. When it comes to average annual earnings worldwide, women take home $ 10,778 to men's $ 19,873 paycheck, even though the report notes that women put in around 50 minutes more of work each day than men. Women are also still less likely to achieve senior positions in the workplace, the guardian notes. Iceland and finland are at the top of the 144-nation survey based on progress in economic opportunity, education, and other metrics, while yemen and pakistan bring up the rear; the us comes in at no. 45. Not that women should be resigned to cashing in smaller paychecks than their male counterparts for nearly two more centuries. \" these forecasts are not foregone conclusions, \" says wef executive committee member saadia zahidi, per reuters, noting they're just a current progress indicator and should serve as a wake-up call to remedy the problem. \" ensuring the healthy development and appropriate use of half of the world's total talent pool has a vast bearing on the growth, competitiveness, and future readiness of economies and businesses worldwide, \" the wef report notes.

Results from the new treatment's first clinical trial ‚Äî which found no serious side effects in 14 volunteers ‚Äî were published wednesday in science translational medicine. Researchers caution, however, that larger tests are needed to back up the results, notes healthday. When a person has type 1 diabetes, their immune system begins to target beta cells that produce insulin, according to the press release. The new treatment uses things called t-regulatory immune cells ‚Äî or tregs ‚Äî which can slow the immune system's attack on beta cells while still allowing it to continue fighting infections. Researchers removed up to a pint of blood ‚Äî along with 2 million to 4 million tregs ‚Äî from patients. After putting those tregs into a growth medium to increase their numbers by 1,500 %, they were returned to the patient's body. The independent reports up to a quarter of those tregs were still in the volunteers ' bodies a year later. Researchers will now prepare a second trial to test the effectiveness of the treatment. A diabetes specialist at lenox hill hospital in new york city who was not affiliated with the study called the results \" very promising. \" ( these stats show why this could be a very big deal. )",

According to panasonic, this battery has been designed with card-type devices and wearables in mind.

A few takeaways: most romney attacks missed. Mitt held off assaults from newt gingrich and rick santorum, rarely getting flustered, politico reports. Mitt fumbled a little. Two remarks may come back to haunt him: a boast that he'd forced ted kennedy to mortgage his house, and a claim he had never seen super pac ads supporting his candidacy. His waffling over why he hadn't run for re-election as governor of massachusetts seemed \" ridiculous, \" buzzfeed notes. Newt coined a phrase. Gingrich told romney to cut the \" pious baloney, \" showing newt won't play mr. Nice guy anymore. Jon huntsman and rick perry shined. Huntsman got his most air-time ever while perry was smooth and polished. Too little, too late for both of them? rick santorum went after ron paul. \"the problem with congressman paul is, all the things that republicans like about him he can't accomplish and all the things they're worried about, he ' ll do day one, \" said santorum, reports the washington post.

Northeastern university criminologist james alan fox tells reuters that an older population, better policing, and more security cameras seem to have had an effect. He also says the ubiquity of cellphones may also play a role: \" it's hard for criminals to do anything without being caught on video. \" the number of us prisoners has also fallen in tandem with violent crime reduction, falling 6 % last year compared to 2008, reports pew charitable trusts, as per reuters: thirty-two states have experienced falling crime rates as the imprisonment rate dropped, with california claiming the largest imprisonment-rate reduction ( 15 % over five years ) and a crime-rate reduction of 11 %.

        "summary": "With few leads in the brutal murder of a jogger earlier this month, the new york police department has released a sketch of a man it believes could provide a much-needed break in the case, the new york daily news reports. According to wabc, the man in the sketch was spotted by a utility worker near spring creek park in queens around the same time karina vetrano was killed aug. 2. The worker was surprised when he saw the man coming along a path from the park and initially thought he was about to be mugged, newsday reports. Police don't believe the man in the sketch is vetrano's killer, but he may have seen something. \" he is not a subject; he is not even a poi, \" chief of detectives robert boyce tells the daily news. Vetrano went for her normal run around 5: 30pm aug. 2, entering the park a few blocks from her home. Her body was found that night in the park; she had been beaten, sexually assaulted, and strangled. Police believe it was a random attack. They have the killer's dna from vetrano's body and phone but no matches so far. Vetrano's father recently went on the radio to discuss a \" mystery jogger \" who had been running in the area but hadn't been seen since vetrano's murder. That man turned himself in to police and was cleared after it was discovered a knee injury had kept him from running. The reward for information leading to vetrano's killer is now $ 300,000.",

Specifically, the interplay of solar winds, galactic cosmic rays, and the magnetic field has scientists scratching their heads. \"the models that have been thought to predict what should happen are all incorrect, \" says a johns hopkins physicist who authored one of the studies. \"we essentially have absolutely no reliable roadmap of what to expect at this point. \" wired uses an analogy to help explain the confusion, playing off one scientist's remark about voyager still being \" inside the sun's house, \" that is, in our solar system. \" it's almost as if voyager thought it was going outside but instead found itself standing in the foyer of the sun's home with an open door that allows wind to blow in from the galaxy. Not only were scientists not expecting this foyer to exist, they have no idea how long the probe will stay inside of it. \" so when might the spacecraft, which launched in 1977 and thus stores its data on an eight-track, leave that foyer for interstellar space? \" it could be any day, but it could be several years, \" says the latter scientist, reports the bbc.",

            "As the voyager 1 spacecraft speeds toward interstellar space at a rate of about a million miles a day, the nasa probe is causing scientists to jettison some long-standing theories on the nature of our solar system and life along its cold, dark edge. In three studies published thursday in the journal science, voyager researchers provided the most detailed view yet of a mysterious region more than 11 billion miles from earth, where the sun's ferocious solar winds slow to a whisper and pieces of atoms blasted across the galaxy by ancient supernovae drift into the solar system. The area, which has been dubbed the \" magnetic highway, \" is a newly discovered area of the heliosphere, the vast bubble of magnetism that surrounds the planets and is inflated by gusting solar winds. Like earth's magnetosphere, which shields us from radioactive solar winds, the heliosphere shields the solar system from many of the cosmic rays that fill interstellar space. Scientists had long envisioned its outermost layer, the heliosheath, to be a curved, distinct boundary separating the solar system from the rest of the milky way. They theorized that once voyager 1 crossed that threshold, three things would happen: the sun's solar winds would become still; galactic cosmic rays would bombard voyager from every angle; and the direction of the dominant magnetic field would",
            "Not content with simply being the man-made object to travel farthest from earth, nasa's voyager 1 spacecraft recently entered a bizarre new region at the solar system's edge that has physicists baffled.

            "As the voyager 1 spacecraft speeds toward interstellar space at a rate of about a million miles a day, the nasa probe is causing scientists to jettison some long-standing theories on the nature of our solar system and life along its cold, dark edge. In three studies published thursday in the journal science, voyager researchers provided the most detailed view yet of a mysterious region more than 11 billion miles from earth, where the sun's ferocious solar winds slow to a whisper and pieces of atoms blasted across the galaxy by ancient supernovae drift into the solar system. The area, which has been dubbed the \" magnetic highway, \" is a newly discovered area of the heliosphere, the vast bubble of magnetism that surrounds the planets and is inflated by gusting solar winds. Like earth's magnetosphere, which shields us from radioactive solar winds, the heliosphere shields the solar system from many of the cosmic rays that fill interstellar space. Scientists had long envisioned its outermost layer, the heliosheath, to be a curved, distinct boundary separating the solar system from the rest of the milky way. They theorized that once voyager 1 crossed that threshold, three things would happen: the sun's solar winds would become still; galactic cosmic rays would bombard voyager from every angle; and the direction of the dominant magnetic field would",

Corbett's conviction came after he broke into the oscar-winning actress ' home as she hid in a closet. He was inside her house when police arrived. After that incident, police found a cache of weapons in his home. Corbett's lawyer tells the ap the warrant was being served because corbett missed a court date last month for a progress report hearing related to his probation in the bullock case. \" he was due for a progress report and he just didn't want to go to court, \" the attorney says. \" it's a very sad situation. \"",

Acevedo was born in 1924 in california to mexican parents who were deported 13 years later; he and his siblings went to mexico, too, and he re-entered the us at age 17 to join the army. In october 1944, acevedo found himself a medic in europe. Just a few months later, at the battle of the bulge, he was captured, and began a journal that would end up being hugely significant, one that's coming back into view in the wake of acevedo's feb. 11 death at age 93. Acevedo was one of 350 \" undesirables, \" us soldiers that included jews and were sent to the slave labor camp at buchenwald known as berga in february 1945, reports cnn. Half the soldiers sent there didn't make it out alive, and acevedo journaled every us death he observed, as well as horrors experienced there, including his own: being made to fill the bullet holes left in the heads of dead soldiers with wax to mask the shootings. He told cnn in 2008 that dandelion leaves were a \" gourmet meal \" compared to their normal rations: soup cooked from rats and cats, and bread made from sawdust, ground glass, and barley. The press-enterprise reports he weighed just 87 pounds by april 1945. Cnn notes that the us didn't recognize the ordeal of the soldiers kept at berga until acevedo went public with his story in 2008. Acevedo donated his diary, which he concealed in his pants and wrote using ink mixed with urine or snow, to the us holocaust memorial museum in 2010.

Related:'talk of our demise is greatly exaggerated,'says moviepass the company also announced monday that it will keep the monthly subscription price at $ 9.99. It is backing away from a plan, announced just last week, to raise the price to $ 14.99. As part of its new model, moviepass is doing away with a bunch of other changes, too. The company will suspend surge pricing, which sometimes added as much as $ 8 to the cost of an individual ticket. And it will no longer enforce ticket verification, which required users to take a picture of their ticket stub and submit it to the company as a way to stop abuse of the service. The new plan will also include \" many major studio first-run films, \" according to the company. That reverses a change announced last week that would have cut access to blockbusters within the first two weeks of release. Moviepass ceo mitch lowe described the changes in an interview earlier monday with the wall street journal. \" i should have accelerated the process of reducing the burn faster in hindsight, \" he told the newspaper. \" now i realize no matter how patient investors say they will be, they never are. \" related: welp.

The redhead from the original scene, a purported fan-favorite in place since 1967, will become a pirate herself with a gun and liquor bottle resting against her hips. \" we believe the time is right to turn the page to a new story in this scene, consistent with the humorous, adventurous spirit of the attraction, \" a rep for the resort says, per the orange county register. It will only be the latest change to the pirates ride. The scene that follows the auction once showed pirates chasing after women; those women now hold trays of food that the pirates are ostensibly going after, an alteration theme park insider calls an attempt to \" remove ( or at least, soften ) the insinuation of impending sexual assault. \" another scene showing a pirate chasing a woman was flipped so the woman now chases the pirate. Many people commenting on a disney blog post are against the change to an \" iconic part of the ride, \" but a park designer says \" change is a'tradition ' at disneyland. \"",

The cavaliers will play the golden state warriors in game 1 of the finals in oakland on thursday. \"no matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in america is tough, \" james said on wednesday afternoon after a practice session at oracle arena. \"racism will always be a part of the world, a part of america.

        "summary": "A federal report on the tragic death of forest service officer brad treat is out and the message is clear: beware of what could be around the corner when you're mountain biking. The 38-year-old officer was mauled to death by a grizzly bear he surprised while mountain biking with a friend in the flathead national forest in montana last year. According to the board of review's report, treat slammed into the bear at high speed after rounding a blind curve on the trail, which he biked or jogged almost every day, the great falls tribune reports. Treat broke both his wrists in the fall and was attacked by the bear, which bit his helmet to pieces. Investigators say treat apparently had no time to try to brake. Investigators say treat's friend ‚Äî who didn't have a phone, firearm, or bear spray ‚Äî waited for \" a short time \" before deciding against trying to push the bear off the officer, kbzk reports. He went through the forest to a highway and flagged down a car, but treat was dead by the time help arrived. Since it was deemed to be a surprise encounter rather than a predatory attack, the bear ‚Äî which didn't eat any part of treat ‚Äî was not hunted down. Board of review member chris servheen says there are lessons to be learned for biker safety. \" the main thing is to slow down in places with little sight distance, meaning you can't see very far, \" he says. \" when the trail is thick with vegetation or has curves, we recommend you slow down and shout when approaching blind curves. \"",

Gabrielle giffords, and have so unnerved the former alaska governor and her staff that they're consulting with private security representatives to beef up protection, reports abc news. Aides provided no other details, though a recent youtube video highlighted threats against palin posted on twitter. In a growing spiral of violent rhetoric, death threats have mounted as palin herself has been accused of encouraging deadly attacks by promoting a map marking giffords ' congressional district with crosshairs. Representatives of other districts marked with the crosshairs have also become death-threat targets. In 2008 the secret service warned the obama family of a spike in death threats against them immediately after palin accused barack obama of \" palling around with terrorists, \" reported the telegraph. Palin is now being slammed for her speech yesterday using the term \" blood libel, \" which many jewish groups consider anti-semitic. \" journalists should not manufacture a blood libel that serves to incite the violence they purport to condemn, \" she said in a facebook video.",
