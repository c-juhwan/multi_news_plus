        "summary": "In the mid- ' 60s, ian brady and myra hindley sexually tortured and murdered five children ages 10 to 16 in what came to be known as the moors murders in england. Hindley died behind bars at age 60 in 2002, and now the 79-year-old brady wants to do the same. Brady is in poor health, and he's fighting to be removed from a secure hospital and sent to a prison in his native scotland. As the guardian explains, scottish prisons don't force-feed inmates, and brady wants to be allowed to refuse food and die. The hospital where he's being held says brady has chronic mental illness and requires continued care, including oxygen, and thus shouldn't be transferred. He lost a legal fight on the matter in 2013, and he just lost another this week. The latest decision revolved around a legal technicality on who can represent him — the bbc has the particulars, but the upshot is that brady's longtime attorney will not be allowed to do so. It was unclear what the next steps in the case would be. The telegraph, meanwhile, reveals another new tidbit: when margaret thatcher was prime minister, she was informed that hindley might be considered for release in 1995 and brady in 2005. At a time when capital punishment was being hotly debated, she told her home secretary that wouldn't do. \" i do not think that either of these prisoners should ever be released from custody, \" she wrote. \" their crime was the most hideous and evil in modern times. \" the pair were convicted of three murders and confessed to two others in prison.

With both cows, there was no discernible cause of death and the animals had a complete circle cleanly cut around the rectal area, the augusta chronicle reports. Of the first cow, found dec. 16, rancher harold edge tells the chronicle, \" i've messed with cows my whole life and she showed no sign of being sick. \" officials at the university of georgia later determined the cow was not diseased. The second cow was found jan. 6. Edge ruled out the possibility of an animal attack causing the deaths. \" there would be other markings on them, \" he says, \" but there are no marks except around the rear end. \" but edge did say he was told that someone may kill a cow for specific parts, like the kidneys, and those may be accessible via the rectum. There also have been recent unexplained cow mutilations in kansas and missouri, kshb reports. On dec. 18 in newton, kan., a bull was found mutilated. Ten days later, two cows in platte county, mo., were reportedly discovered \" killed and gutted. \" on new year's day in canton, kan., a cow was found dead, and its owner tells kshb that \" the eye had been removed, as well as the eyelashes on the top and bottom both. \" for some old-timers, the mutilations are reminiscent of a rash of similar occurrences in the 1970s, when thousands of cattle and other livestock were found dead and mutilated, the ap reports. Theories seeking to explain the mutilations, per the ap, range from wild animals to the government and extraterrestrials. ( in south carolina, someone killed more than 300,000 chickens. )",

            "Evangelical preacher david grisham filmed this video at a texas mall as he walked up and down a line of people waiting to see santa yelling that santa is not real. ( facebook/david grisham ) at first, the parents try to ignore the screaming man at the mall telling their children they've been lied to about santa claus. Then it becomes clear he's not going to stop. \"kids, i want to tell you today that there is no such thing as santa claus, \" the man tells people waiting in line for christmas photos at the westgate mall in amarillo, tex. \"santa claus does not exist. The christmas season is about jesus. \"the man you're going to see today is just a man in a suit dressed up like santa. \" the shouting man is david grisham, an evangelical street preacher from anchorage, who has shouted his sermons at people across the country for nearly a decade, whether they want to hear them or not. On saturday, his unwilling audience was a group of families snaked around westgate's seasonal christmas village at the food court near hot topic and the gap. Grisham paid no heed to",
            "\" if god told me to go preach to the devil himself in hell, i'd go there, \" grisham said. \" but my wife said only if we flew southwest because they have the cheapest tickets. \" grisham said he's received hundreds of death threats since the video went viral, including threats to \" stab him in the throat, \" \" bust out his teeth \" and shoot him. But the threats show that he accomplished his mission: get jesus into the christmas conversation. \" i ' m using the platform god is giving me, \" grisham said. \" with that platform, i can reach more people than a mega-church. \" though it's not the first time grisham made headlines, saturday's evangelism mission may be the most viral. The video had been viewed more than 2.5 million times by monday morning. Grisham begins the video by introducing himself as a member of last frontier evangelism, an organization he started with tracy in anchorage, alaska, where they recently moved from amarillo.

        "summary": "After a feared crackdown never materialized, thousands of pro-democracy protesters remained on the streets of hong kong for another day today as china marked the national day holiday. Even as the numbers of protesters blocking key parts of the city swelled, one of the things that most surprised the world's media was just how polite and orderly things remained: the bbc lists a few things that could \" only happen during a hong kong protest, \" including student protesters doing homework during a sit-in; signs apologizing for the inconvenience attached to makeshift barricades; crowds being offered not only free water and snacks, but free shirt-fresheners; protesters cleaning up — and recycling — every scrap of litter; and protesters filling the streets surrounding a war memorial, but obeying the sign asking them to keep off the grass. Hong kong chief executive leung chun-ying's government has decided — with beijing's blessing — that the best response to the massive protests is to do nothing, insiders say. Negotiating with the protesters has been ruled out, and authorities have decided to wait for the public to lose patience with the disruption. \" the government can tolerate the blockade of three or four or five areas and see how the demonstrations go, so the only way the demonstrators can go is to escalate it — spread it to more places, and then they cannot sustain it — or they will become violent, \" a government source tells the new york times, adding that if the protesters become violent, \" they know better than we do that they will lose support overnight. \" archbishop desmond tutu is among those who have offered support to the protesters, saying, \" their struggle is one that all who believe in the principles of democracy and justice should support, \" reports the south china morning post. In mainland china, meanwhile, national day celebrations went ahead normally, although the 10,000 pigeons released in beijing's tiananmen square were tightly scrutinized, with their feathers and anuses checked for dangerous materials, reports the ap. Some critics compared the pigeons ' plight to that of the chinese public. \" the liberty and dignity of citizens are increasingly vulnerable, and can be expropriated at any time, like with the pigeons, \" wrote columnist zhang ping. \" they have to go through the pains and insults of the rude anal check and yet they must appear peaceful and happy on the screen of the state broadcaster. \"",

Police say that after a call from a concerned citizen, they found that andria desha james had three children, all 9 or 10 years old, in the trunk of her chevy malibu, reports the daily news journal. She was charged with reckless endangerment, and parents were called to come and collect the children, who are all believed to be her students. A metropolitan nashville public schools spokesman tells the dnj that james is a part-time tutor and has been suspended during the investigation. The \" acts she is accused of are completely inappropriate for an educator entrusted with caring for students, \" the spokesman says. James, who was released on bail early monday, tells wkrn that she never had nine children in her car and it is a \" complete and utter lie \" that any of them were in the trunk. \" all of them never got into the trunk; there was plenty of room, those kids and seat belts, \" she says. A police spokesman, however, tells the station that surveillance video from the gas station shows three children getting out of the trunk after james pulled up to a gas pump. ( last year, a childcare worker in ohio was charged with child endangerment after accidentally dropping her 2-year-old son into a cheetah pit. )",

        "summary": "Mcdonald's can't completely reject responsibility for the pay and working conditions of people in mcdonald's uniforms serving mcdonald's food at mcdonald's restaurants, the national labor relations board decided in a landmark ruling yesterday. The board said that the company could be considered a joint employer in worker rights complaints, despite its insistence that the franchisees who operate around 90 % of its restaurants are independent operators in charge of setting wages and other policies, reports the chicago tribune. If the ruling holds up in appeals, which could go as far as the supreme court, it could make it a lot easier for fast-food workers to unionize amid a push for $ 15 hourly pay. Mcdonald's blasted the ruling as an \" outrageous \" and \" radical \" move that goes against decades of established law and could end up hurting businesses in other sectors, the ap reports. A lawyer for some of the mcdonald's workers involved in the case, however, argues that mcdonald's has so much control over its restaurants that it needs to accept responsibility for labor conditions. \" the reality is that mcdonald's requires franchisees to adhere to such regimented rules and regulations that there's no doubt who's really in charge, \" he says. A labor law professor at the university of texas agrees. \" employers like mcdonald's seek to avoid recognizing the rights of their employees by claiming that they are not really their employer, despite exercising control over crucial aspects of the employment relationship, \" he tells the new york times. \" mcdonald's should no longer be able to hide behind its franchisees. \"",

So report researchers in australia this month in the journal bmc public health after they reviewed nine studies on the issue and deemed the evidence for such a link \" moderate. \" the lead researcher explains in a eureka alert press release that \" anecdotally, we are seeing an increase in anxiety symptoms in our modern society, which seems to parallel the increase in sedentary behavior \" ( the national institute of mental health reports generalized anxiety disorders affect about 6.8 million american adults ). The researchers wanted to see if there truly was a link, and their research suggested \" a positive association between sitting time and anxiety symptoms, \" though they say more study is needed. In their meta analysis of the nine studies, all of which were published between 1990 and 2014 and ranged in size from 189 to 13,470 participants, five studies linked one's level of sedentary behavior with one's risk of anxiety. But don't think this means modern technology is solely to blame. While four studies showed that total sitting time affected the link, the association was less strong when separating out screen time — such as sitting in front of a tv or computer. And one study found that how much one sat while commuting was tied to anxiety risk, but sitting for work or leisure were not. So why the link in the first place? sedentary behavior could disrupt sleep patterns, metabolic health, and social interactions, reports livescience.

The former daily show correspondent made her much-anticipated debut monday with a focus on \" the most deranged \" election in a generation. How'd she do? it was \" an acerbic, bracing premiere that felt like, in the best way possible, a much-needed slap in the face, \" writes sonia saraiya at salon. A field segment investigating jeb bush's lack of appeal in new hampshire was the highlight. It \" might be the greatest piece of satire made yet about the 2016 election. \" \" finally, [ jon stewart's ] successor has arrived, \" writes kevin fallon at the daily beast. Bee's \" kind of topical comedy that doubles as some serious journalism \" puts her on the same playing field as john oliver, but her goofiness and fresh perspective set her apart. Her \" greatest asset \" is that she's \" willing to go for blood, \" fallon writes. The best bit of the night? when kansas sen. Mitch hess was named \" elected paperweight of the month. \" daniel fienberg calls it \" a bee-plus debut. \" though not all of the candidate jokes were original, they were \" originally expressed, \" he writes at the hollywood reporter. Some pieces felt \" flimsy, \" but \" everything had a specific perspective that set it apart from the half-dozen guys whose shows followed bee's lead, \" fienberg says. Danette chavez agrees \" the full frontal crew had the time to turn a sad-trombone moment into a symphony \" to close out the debut show. Though bee's approach is similar to that of oliver and the daily show, it \" still feels fresh, perhaps because we're finally seeing a female host lead the charge, with a female showrunner ( jo miller ) and a diverse team of writers, \" chavez writes at av club.",

        "summary": "Another lawmaker has announced a career shift in the wake of sexual harassment allegations. Cnn reports rep. Ruben kihuen said saturday he won't run for re-election in 2018. The house ethics committee announced an investigation into the democrat from nevada on friday over allegations of sexual harassment from two women. Kihuen denies the allegations against him but says they \" would be a distraction \" during a re-election campaign. Despite calls to resign from democratic leaders, the 37-year-old says he won't step down before the end of his first term in 2018, according to the las vegas review-journal. \" due process and the presumption of innocence are bedrock legal principles which have guided our nation for centuries, and they should not be lost to unsubstantiated hearsay and innuendo, \" kihuen says. Kihuen was first accused earlier this month by a woman who says he asked her for dates and sex and grabbed her thighs while she was serving as finance director for his 2016 campaign. A second, unnamed accuser spoke to the nevada independent this week. She says between 2013 and 2015 while kihuen was a state senator, he touched her thighs or buttocks on three occasions and sent her hundreds of suggestive text messages, which she saved and showed to the independent.

Amri's family members, speaking from his hometown of oueslatia in central tunisia, were shaken to learn he's the prime suspect in monday's truck attack, which killed 12. Amri, who turned 24 on thursday, left tunisia years ago for europe but had been in regular contact with his brothers via facebook and phone. \" i ask him to turn himself into the police, \" brother abdelkader amri tells the ap. \" if it is proved that he is involved, we dissociate ourselves from it. \" he says his brother may have been radicalized in prison in italy, where he went after leaving tunisia in the wake of the arab spring uprisings. In other developments: german media reported several locations were searched overnight, including a house in dortmund and a refugee home in emmerich on the dutch border. Federal prosecutors, who are leading the investigation, declined to comment. The manhunt also prompted police in denmark to search a sweden-bound ferry in the port of grenaa after receiving tips that someone resembling amri had been spotted. But police said they found nothing indicating his presence. German officials had deemed amri, who arrived in the country last year, a potential threat long before the attack. They had been trying to deport him after his asylum application was rejected, and politicians are now bickering over what conclusions should be drawn. The berlin market that was attacked has reopened. Concrete blocks have been put in place at the roadside to heighten security. Organizers decided to reopen the market next to the central kaiser wilhelm memorial church on thursday, though without party music or bright lighting. Berliners and visitors have laid candles and flowers at the site in tribute. Israel foreign ministry rep emmanuel nahshon said thursday that citizen dalia elyakim was among those killed in the attack. Elyakim was visiting berlin with her husband rami and had been missing since the attack. Her husband was seriously wounded but is now stable. The couple, in their 60s, loved to travel, friends say. Donald trump, when asked wednesday if the attack in berlin would cause him to evaluate the proposed ban or a possible registry of muslims in the united states, said \" you know my plans.

A 52-year-old academic, dawut wrote and lectured across the country about uighur folklore, shrines, and music, and even received official government support. Then she vanished on a trip from beijing to the uighur-dominated xinjiang region in december. \" virtually all expressions of uighurs ' unique culture are dangerous now, and there's no better evidence of that than the disappearance of rahile dawut, \" says an academic at loyola university new orleans who has researched uighurs. \" there was a lot of hope that they would see that she was a nonthreat and release her, but that hope gradually dwindled. \" dawut is far from alone: with president xi jinping redoubling anti-uighur efforts, the un says china is likely holding a million uighurs in secret camps, reuters reports. Among the disappeared are a popular musician, a soccer star, writers, and webmasters. But dawut's apparent arrest is proof that \" any uighur academic with foreign ties is branded a'two-faced intellectual ' — disloyal to the state and in need of re-education, \" says a student of uighur music in london. \" the accounts of the're-education'regime that people are undergoing in those camps are harrowing. \" long nervous about the mostly muslim group, chinese officials grew alarmed after deadly uighur riots in 2009 and violent assaults in 2014, per the times.

Brady claims running and weight-lifting lead to dense, easily injured muscles. Pliable muscles — a non-scientific term that one expert calls \" balderdash \" — apparently absorb stress to decrease the likelihood of injury. Brady says you can get pliable muscles through \" targeted, deep-force muscle work \" and \" the daily acts of living that complement my off-field life. \" brady's advice on nutrition starts well enough ( avoid sugary foods and processed carbs ) before warning of foods like strawberries, tomatoes, and salmon. It's unclear why. The book comes with a number of recipes, and sports illustrated tried a few out, quickly becoming exasperated with brady's inexact instructions ( soak tomatoes* for \" 2-6 hours \" ). But perhaps the most eye-popping claim in the book: water can prevent sunburns. Deadspin reports brady claims to drink about 2.5 gallons of water per day and credits that for not getting sunburns like he did when he was a kid. He then goes on to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of various types of water, from tap to mineral to carbonated.

        "summary": "A federal judge has ruled in bill cosby's favor, vanity fair reports, saying he can sue a woman accusing him of sexual assault for breach of contract. In the \" mixed ruling, \" us district judge eduardo robreno said the disgraced actor can move forward with a lawsuit against andrea constand based on a pair of 2014 tweets and an interview she did with the toronto sun, per the hollywood reporter. However, people reports, robreno found that cosby could not sue constand based on her having talked to police about an alleged 2004 sexual assault, which led to cosby's arrest. Cosby has argued that constand violated a 2006 settlement agreement. With regard to speaking to police, the judge said confidentiality cannot be enforced because it would preclude people from providing information about alleged crimes. As for the tweets — \" i won't go away, there is a lot more i will say \" and \" it's not that everybody just forgot about it, truth is nobody cared \" — constand contends they did not violate confidentiality provisions because they didn't name cosby. But, writes robreno, \" a statement can be a reference to an individual or situation even if it does not explicitly say so. \" he adds, \" whether the tweets were in fact references to cosby — and, if so, whether constand breached the csa by tweeting them — are questions to be answered at a later stage. \" the judge also gave cosby the green light to sue constand's attorneys for releasing a decade-old deposition, in which cosby admits to giving women drugs to facilitate having sex with them, e! reports. The attorneys, however, say they had no part in the release of the information. Finally, cosby is permitted to sue the national enquirer for releasing portions of the depositions.",

            "Mexico city ( ap ) — at least 12 people were killed and 10 injured in egypt's southwestern desert sunday when security forces mistakenly fired on a group of mexican tourists, egyptian officials said. The mexican foreign ministry confirmed the incident and said at least two of the dead were mexican nationals. It said in a statement that the victims were still being identified, and foreign ministry personnel were working with the families of the victims. A joint military-police force was pursuing \" terrorist elements \" in the area and fired on four cars that turned out to be carrying tourists, according to egypt's interior ministry. The ministry said the victims were mexican and egyptian. The tour company involved \" did not have permits and did not inform authorities, \" rasha azazi, a spokesperson for the egyptian ministry of tourism, told the associated press, adding that any trips to the farafra area are required to be cleared by officials. \" they were not supposed to be there, \" she said, but could not provide further information on the circumstances of the shooting. Mexican foreign minister claudia ruiz massieu was in contact with egypt's ambassador to mexico and demanded a thorough investigation into and explanation of what happened, the mexican statement said. She also demanded the support of egyptian authorities for mexican nationals being transported to cairo",
            "Cairo ( reuters ) - egyptian army aircraft hunting for militants in the desert mistakenly bombed a convoy of mostly mexican tourists, killing 12 people and wounding 10, authorities said on monday. Survivors said their group was bombed from a plane and helicopters. As members of the tourist convoy tried to flee, additional forces on the ground fired on them, egyptian security sources said. Egypt's interior ministry described the attack in the country's western desert as an accident. Mexico's president enrique pena nieto said two mexicans were killed in sunday's incident, though egyptian security and judicial sources later said eight mexicans and four egyptians were killed.

Milos zeman announced a press conference for thursday, but instead of briefing reporters, he had two firefighters in protective gear help him burn a huge pair of red underpants in front of them, the ap reports.

Those three words sum up about as tidily as possible the ghastly bondage — the incessant psychic and physical torture — that the kim dynasty has made the north korean way of life for more than half a century. No sooner did the state news agency release the news of kim jong-il's death than the public plazas of pyongyang began to fill with neatly assembled ranks of citizens, weeping and wailing on command, while state television recorded the spectacle, which was promptly uploaded to youtube. Early in the most heavily circulated clip, the fakeness of the grieving is obvious: you can see the captive mourners forcing the sobs, moaning unconvincingly, and squeezing their eyes to produce tears. But by about half way through the clip, the atmosphere of absolute bereavement looks real: men and women prostrate themselves, writhing and howling in what appears to be acute and authentic agony. Here in the space of just a few minutes of videotape we see the method and the madness of the kims ' grim dominion over north korea enacted in miniature — we watch a lie become reality.

        "summary": "The story of how the titanic was found is widely known, but some of the most interesting details are only now emerging, reports usa today. A new exhibit at the national geographic museum in washington, dc, reveals the once top-secret story. \" the navy is finally discussing it, \" robert ballard tells national geographic. Ballard is the oceanographer and navy commander who found the wreck in 1985. The exhibit, titanic: the untold story, explains how the navy had commissioned ballard to explore the wreckage of two nuclear submarines. The subs were resting on the floor of the north atlantic ocean, and the navy wanted to determine if the nuclear reactors on board were potentially dangerous and why the subs had sunk. Ballard asked if he could look for the titanic after he had completed the mission ( which would be the first of two ) because he believed the passenger liner was located between the two subs. Deputy chief of naval operations ronald thunman agreed, never suspecting that ballard might be successful. \" i was a little short with him, \" recalls thunman, who stressed that ballard's mission was to study the sunken warships, not look for the titanic. Ballard studied every detail of the titanic and decided to seek not the ship itself, but the debris field. He theorized that the ship had broken in half and left a debris trail as it sank. He approached it as if he were photographing a deer hiding in winter: \" i'd look for its footprints and follow its footsteps, \" he says. At 2am on sept. 1, 1985, submersible robotic technology began delivering images of the titanic's boiler. \" we were at the very spot the titanic sank, \" ballard recalls. \" we were there. \" of course, the navy hadn't expected ballard to find the titanic, so when that happened, \" they got really nervous because of the publicity, \" ballard says. The exhibit will be on display through jan. 6, 2019. ( this documentary claims a fire was part of the titanic's undoing. )",

President trump, who viewed strzok's animosity toward him as typical of the dc establishment behind what he calls the robert mueller \" witch hunt, \" was among those celebrating the news. Coverage: overruled: strzok's attorney, aitan goelman, thinks his 48-year-old client was unfairly punished given that the fbi's own office of professional responsibility recommended only a 60-day suspension and a demotion. However, the fbi's no. 2, david bowdich, overruled that recommendation, reports the new york times. Strzok spent more than 20 years at the fbi and had become a top counterintelligence agent. Trump: \"agent peter strzok was just fired from the fbi - finally, \" the president wrote. \" the list of bad players in the fbi &amp; doj gets longer &amp; longer. Based on the fact that strzok was in charge of the witch hunt, will it be dropped? it is a total hoax. No collusion, no obstruction - i just fight back! \"",

However, centuries-old caste and community barriers still come into play, and there has been a spurt in \" honor killings \" in recent years across northern india. Zahida and husna were neighbors in baghpat, a town in india's uttar pradesh state, when they fell in love with two construction workers. They eloped and got married last week before returning home to make peace with their families, kusan said.

After a decade in the wilderness, wall street's most powerful firm, goldman sachs, is dominating the early days of the incoming trump administration.

The president-elect has talked about weakening the dodd-frank financial reform legislation, which came down particularly hard on goldman and its wall street-centric business model. Since the election, goldman's stock has risen 23 percent, much more than the broader market. In the year before the election, its stock fell about 10 percent. On wednesday, after mr. Cohn's meeting with mr. Trump became public, the bank's shares rose 3.6 percent. Mr. Blankfein",

After donald trump ridiculed wall street on the campaign trail, the president-elect tapped former goldman sachs group inc. Executive steven mnuchin to be his treasury secretary and billionaire investor wilbur ross to lead the commerce department. Trump even met with goldman sachs president gary cohn inside trump tower. It would suit tilson just fine if voters who backed trump because he promised to rein in wall street are furious now that he's surrounding himself with bankers and billionaires. \"i can take glee in that -- i think donald trump conned them"

Cops ran that name, found her driver's license, and contacted her kids, whom she started to remember as their names were mentioned and their pictures shown. Although gabrielle hadn't exhibited signs of memory loss before she vanished, she told colette and others she'd been attacked in an oregon park and her memory deteriorated after that. The family had an emotional reunion in early march in santa barbara, and now gabrielle's kids are trying to help her recover lost memories. \" the more we talk to her, the more things pop into her head, \" colette tells the post.

This line from the paper in brain stimulation gives context: many patients \" fail to fully recover from coma, and awaken to a disorder of consciousness such as...

One of the researchers is alexander bystritsky, who pioneered the technique called low-intensity focused ultrasound pulsation, which is a lot like what it sounds like: the energy emitted isn't as high as in a normal ultrasound, and the energy was delivered for 30 seconds of every minute for 10 minutes. The researchers are keeping their excitement in check, however, given this is only a case study and it is possible that \" we were just very lucky and happened to have stimulated the patient just as he was spontaneously recovering. \" but they do think it's quite possible they helped \" jumpstart \" the man's brain by exciting the neurons in the most affected region. \" targeting the thalamus \" in cases like these \" has been successful in the past, \" an outside researcher tells the observer, but those cases required invasive surgery.

And some students are jumping right on the hacker bandwagon, echoing the age-old argument of \" when are we ever going to need this stuff? \" \" when it came to x and y and graphing, that's when i started dropping, and it made me feel low, \" says an 18-year-old college freshman, noting he used to be good at math until algebra entered the picture. There's resistance to hacker's platform, though, including from educators ( especially those behind common core standards ) who insist algebra helps students wrap their heads around formulas and relationships — a valuable skill for many jobs. \" algebra is the tool for consolidating your knowledge of arithmetic, \" a math professor says, with another adding that schools have no way of knowing which kids might need algebra and which won't. But, as hacker contends in his times piece, there's \" no reason to force [ students ] to grasp vectorial angles and discontinuous functions \" and make everyone pull the \" huge boulder \" that is math without really examining \" what all this pain achieves. \" ( meanwhile, parents have to go back to school to learn their kids ' math. )",

        "summary": "An american woman living in zimbabwe could face 20 years in prison for subversion over a tweet. According to prosecutors, new jersey native martha o'donovan, 25, tweeted a photo last month of president robert mugabe next to a drawing of a catheter and a reference to him being \" selfish &amp; sick, \" per the new york times and al jazeera. The tweet came from an anonymous account known to be critical of zimbabwe's government, but prosecutors say they were crafted by o'donovan as part of a months-long effort \" to incite political unrest \" and \" replicate offline uprisings like what happened in tunisia and egypt \" in 2011. O'donovan says those claims are \" baseless and malicious, \" per the ap. In granting a $ 1,000 bail on thursday, a high court judge appeared to agree. O'donovan — who works as a project coordinator at magamba network, an online news channel known for political satire — has \" a plausible defense, \" said judge clement phiri, adding he's seen no evidence of a plot \" to overthrow the government. \" though o'donovan is ordered to stay in zimbabwe, her lawyer says the hearing was a victory since o'donovan had spent at least three days in a maximum security prison following her arrest a week ago, while the twitter account cited by prosecutors remained active. Hers is the first internet abuse case since a ministry designed to monitor cybersecurity was created last month. Some fear it's actually being used to control social media as mugabe, 93, seeks re-election next year, following a 37-year rule.",

In the letter — which can be seen in full here — bezos praised his company's \" divinely discontent \" customers and said setting high standards was the way to deal with \" ever-rising customer expectations. \" amazon launched the service, which costs around $ 100 a year in the us, in 2005. Analysts have long tried to determine the number of subscribers, with one recent estimate putting it at 80 million, reports slate. The service offers streaming music and video as well as free shipping on many amazon products, and while netflix has more subscribers, prime's numbers are well ahead of competitors like spotify and apple music. In his letter, bezos also disclosed that technical work is underway to bring prime benefits to shoppers at whole foods, which amazon bought last year.

Well, bay finally told the world he's sorry about that, 15 years after the fact, in an interview with the miami herald...

It was a massive undertaking. That was not fair to the movie. I would redo the entire third act if i could. But the studio literally took the movie away from us. It was terrible. My visual effects supervisor had a nervous breakdown, so i had to be in charge of that. I called james cameron and asked 'what do you do when you're doing all the effects yourself? ' \" but, he notes, \" the movie did fine. \" what that means: it made $ 500 million, vanity fair points out. One of the many reactions that popped up: writes vanity fair's julie miller, \" now if only he could reimburse us for that expensive dissociation therapy we needed for aerosmith's ' i don't want to miss a thing, ' we would be getting somewhere. \" and then there was this: the apology is notable since, jesse david fox points out for vulture, \" bay is not necessarily known as hollywood's most self-deprecating director. Hell, he might be the least. \" bay backtracks: well, fox may have been right, because bay wrote a post on his forum that vulture spotted.

A recent study found that the stars in the galaxy, called segue 1, contain fewer heavy elements than those of any other galaxy known, implying that the object may have stopped evolving almost 13 billion years ago. If true, segue 1 could offer a window into the conditions of the early universe and reveal how some of the first galaxies came to be. Segue 1 is very, very tiny. It appears to contain only a few hundred stars, compared with the few hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy. Researchers led by anna frebel of the massachusetts institute of technology collected detailed information on the elemental composition of six of the brightest of segue 1's stars using the las campanas observatory's magellan telescopes in chile and the keck observatory in hawaii. The measurements, reported in a paper accepted for the astrophysical journal, revealed that these stars are made almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, and contain just trace amounts of heavier elements such as iron. No other galaxy studied holds so few heavy elements, making segue 1 the \"least chemically evolved galaxy known. \" complex elements are forged inside the cores of stars by the nuclear fusion of more basic elements such as hydrogen and helium atoms.

        "summary": "Shrinking the gender gap in american workplaces could give the us economy a boost almost as big as the gdp of california, according to the latest mckinsey global institute study. The institute found that while the economy could grow by $ 4.3 trillion if the gender gap was completely eliminated, a more realistic target of $ 2.1 trillion could be hit by 2025 with moves including getting a larger proportion of women to participate in the workforce and more evenly distributing \" unpaid care work \" like looking after children, bloomberg reports. According to the mckinsey report, narrowing the gap would improve the economy of every state by at least 5 %, and half of them by more than 10 %. \" it's the economically smart thing to do, \" says kweilin ellingrud, lead author of the report, which found that women account for just 40 % of us productivity. The report gave the us poor marks on issues like teen pregnancy, women in management, and political representation, and high ones on areas such as women in higher education and professional jobs, cnnmoney reports. It suggests that governments should do more to provide childcare and paid parental leave, while businesses invest more in training and recruitment. The report looked at 50 us cities and found that gender equality is highest in baltimore, where many women are in political power, and atlanta, where women have a high share of professional jobs. ( other recent research found that women's salaries peak a decade earlier than men's. )",

            "Want to grow the economy? want to boost your company's bottom line? hire more women and make it easier for them and for men to work full-time while balancing family commitments. That's just one key takeaway from a mckinsey global institute report released thursday. The report -- called the power of parity: advancing women's equality in the united states -- estimates that the u.s. Could grow the economy by an extra $ 2.1 trillion in gross domestic product over the next decade if the private sector, policy makers and non-profits make more of a concerted effort to narrow the gender gap at work. \" it's the economically smart thing to do, \" said kweilin ellingrud, the lead author of the report. While women constitute about 51 % of the u.s. Adult population, they make up just 46 % of the workforce. And they only account for 40 % of the country's productivity. That's in part because more women work part time than men. But it's also because the productivity measured for gdp excludes the estimated $ 1.5 trillion in \" unpaid care work \" such as routine housework and caring for children and elders, which women do twice as much of as men. \" the more equitably [ that ] unpaid care work is shared, the more likely it",
            "Every state and city in the united states has the opportunity to further gender parity, which could add $ 4.3 trillion to the country's economy in 2025. The united states could add up to $ 4.3 trillion in annual gdp in 2025 if women attain full gender equality. In a new report, the power of parity: advancing women's equality in the united states, the mckinsey global institute ( mgi ) finds that every us state and city can add at least 5 percent to their gdp in that period by advancing the economic potential of women. Half of us states have the potential to add more than 10 percent, and the country's 50 largest cities can increase gdp by 6 to 13 percent. While the barriers hindering women from fully participating in the labor market make it unlikely that they will attain full gender equality within a decade, the report finds that in a best-in-class scenario — in which each us state matches the state with the fastest rate of improvement toward gender parity in work over the past decade — some $ 2.1 trillion of incremental gdp could be added in 2025. That is 10 percent higher than in a business-as-usual scenario. Achieving this potential would require about $ 475 billion more capital investment in 2025 to help create the 6.4 million jobs needed to secure that boost to gdp and improve productivity"

It's been quite the mysterious sail for the lyubov orlova, which was being towed from canada to the dominican republic to be scrapped when a tug line broke last january, setting it adrift. It was spotted some 1,300 nautical miles off off ireland's west coast about a month later, then disappeared, but signals were received on march 12 and 23. The signals are thought to come from lifeboats that detached from the ship and hit the water, and while people have speculated that the 328-foot vessel sank, the independent reports that some lifeboat signals remain unactivated, indicating it is still afloat. The stomach-turning part of the reports: hundreds of rats are believed to be populating the ship, and while the independent calls them \" disease-ridden, \" most other reports use the word \" cannibal, \" pointing out that they've likely been eating each other for survival.

The 33-year-old guitar teacher, his wife, their 3-day-old baby, and family members were gathered tuesday night at the home in panama city, fla., when a bullet entered the home and struck ayers in the back of the head, killing him. Police arrived and found neighbor charles edward shisler, 62, in his backyard; he lives in a home directly behind the ayers, the officer tells wjhg. Shisler, at first \" extremely belligerent, \" ultimately admitted to the shooting but said it was an accident, the news herald reports. \" the damn gun doesn't usually shoot, \" he said, according to the arrest report. \" you have to squeeze the hell out of the trigger to shoot it. \" he said he picked up the loaded 9mm pistol by its trigger, and the gun discharged.

The news of kepler-62f comes as part of the discovery of three exoplanets that could possibly support life, explains space.com. Kepler-62f is just 40 % bigger than our own planet, and orbits a star that's only 20 % as bright as our sun; the neighboring kepler-62e circles the same star, which is 1,200 light years away. And as the ap explains, they're just the right size ( past ones have been too big, and are likely gas balls like neptune ) and in just the right place ( ie, the habitable zone, where it's not too hot or cold ) near their star. \" this is the first one where i ' m thinking ' huh, kepler-62f really might have life on it ', \" says a co-author of the study on the two, published today. Space.com explains that a separate modeling study indicates the planets might be completely covered in oceans. As for temperature, chief kepler scientist william borucki says kepler-62e is a bit warm, like a hawaiian world, and kepler-62f is a bit chilly, more alaskan. The third exoplanet spotted is kepler-69c; it's 70 % bigger than earth but revolves around a star much like our own; it's being described as the smallest world located in the habitable zone of a star akin to our sun. These are just the most promising of kepler's latest lot; an additional four planets were found in the two new solar systems identified, but none of them could support life.",

        "summary": "Apple is coming out with a new iphone later this year, and the hottest rumor isn't so much about tech specs as price. For its 10th-anniversary phone, apple is said to be considering a price tag north of $ 1,000, and perhaps as high as $ 1,400, for the top model iphone 8. As fortune notes, the idea seemed far-fetched when it surfaced earlier this year in a fast company article, but it has since gained credibility. Here's a look at why that is, with competing views on whether it would be a wise strategy: absolutely: tech writer christopher mims makes a five-point case for such a price point in the wall street journal. Among them: a high-end phone would boost the company's brand, make people \" lust \" for it, and function as a \" halo device, \" as when a car company puts out an uber-expensive top model. People might not shell out the highest price, but they may be more likely to scoop up lesser models. Plus, it would help the \" single most important metric on its balance sheet \" — the average selling price of phones. Nope: at forbes, mark rogowsky offers a point-by-point rebuttal to mims ' piece, concluding that \" apple already has more money than it can intelligently deploy; it should be figuring out how to grow its base, not its cash. \" putting out a $ 1,400 phone \" might do the latter, but isn't in line with what made apple the company it is today. \" the risk: the price may lead customers who otherwise would be willing to upgrade in 2017 to wait for the 2018 model, when the new tech features being unveiled would presumably be available at a lower price, per barron's. No \" home \" button: as usual, rumors and leaks are flying, and bgr takes a look at a recent one, which seems to confirm that the new phone \" will not have a physical home button and its bezels will be smaller than ever. \" your face: it also appears that you ' ll be able to unlock the phone by having it scan your face, reports the verge. The phone also is expected to have apple's first oled screen, along with an \" augmented reality camera system, \" per the financial times. The name: apple is also kicking around calling it the iphone x in honor of the anniversary, per macworld, which also rounds up the latest rumors.
