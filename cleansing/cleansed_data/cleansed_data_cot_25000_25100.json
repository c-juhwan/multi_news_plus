Add it all up, mix in his recent back-room deal to avoid the fiscal cliff and his prominent role on gun-law reform, and you come to an inescapable conclusion: \" joe biden is running for president in 2016, \" writes chris cillizza at the fix blog in the washington post. Or at the very least, he is \" ensuring that any other politician looking at the race — or any donor or activist beginning to mull who they should support — knows that the contest runs through biden. \" with one big exception: hillary clinton. If she runs, even biden will probably defer, writes cillizza. At roll call, stuart rothenberg agrees that biden and clinton \" are in a tier of their own, \" and that clinton is no. 1 within that tier. But biden's recent moves make him a \" more serious contender \" if he opts to run. Read rothenberg's assessment of the rest of the field for both parties here.",

And yet, if you are a true political junkie, you may already be apoplectic that we aren't yet knee-deep in discussions about the next presidential race. While you have my pity if you are one of those people, it's undeniably true that politicians being who and what they are, it is never too early to ponder about the next step of the political ladder. And for some, the white house is the only rung that really matters. I remember in 2005 asking robert gibbs, then the press secretary for recently elected sen.

        "summary": "A high-profile shooting in venezuela continues to grab headlines, with the monday night murder of well-known soap-opera actress and former miss venezuela shining a light on the country's rampant violence — as the nation's leader tries to shift the focus. President nicolas maduro yesterday tried to paint monica spear's death not as a botched robbery but as a \" contract killing, \" though nbc news points out that he provided no details backing up his theory. More on the killing: spear, 29, and husband thomas henry berry separated about two years ago, but friends told nbc that they were close and vacationed together with their 5-year-old daughter, who was shot in the leg. Nbc describes their fateful holiday as an \" idyllic road trip. \" both were no stranger to violence: spear was robbed six times in venezuela, but her family failed in its efforts to persuade her to move to the us. ( though the miami herald notes she lived in miami from december 2012 to june 2013 while filming a soap opera. ) berry was shot in venezuela, where he worked as an adventure tour operator, more than a decade ago and left the country, but moved back in 2006. A police official says their car struck \" a sharp object that had been placed on the highway. \" a tow truck arrived to deal with at least two punctured tires; gunmen did as well, after the car was loaded on the truck. The trio locked themselves in their car, and at least six shots were fired. Spear was hit through her armpit a number of times; berry was struck in the chest. The guardian reports six gang members have been detained; nbc news reports five people have been arrested. The guardian reports by way of local media that the interregional del centro highway sees 10 attacks per month; the gangs known to prey on its drivers tend to try to puncture tires to force victims to pull over. So how dangerous is venezuela? the herald notes that the government stopped disseminating murder data a decade ago; an annual estimate made by the venezuelan observatory of violence put last year's figure at 24,763 murders, which translates to a homicide rate of 79 per 100,000 people; that would be the no. 2 rate in the world, after honduras. For comparison's sake, the murder rate in chicago last year was 4 per 100,000, notes time.",

A child is vulnerable, and never more so than when the perpetrator is a parent. Juxtaposed against the severity of the crime is the difficulty proving it in a court of law. When a child reports sexual abuse, it is often that child's word against the word of the alleged perpetrator. Authorities who receive reports of abuse ensure that children are interviewed by the children's advocacy center, where an expert questions the child. Often, however, the child has made previous statements to members of his or her family, and frequently those statements differ in some respects. This is particularly true with very young children, who are on the cusp of being capable of relating an event in detail. The younger the child, the less detailed the account is likely to be. Authorities look for corroborating evidence to support the report of abuse. They search for forensic evidence, such as dna. They look for medical evidence of abuse.

Two weeks of thermal scanning have revealed signs of internal cavities and structures in several pyramids and a standout anomaly at the so-called great pyramid, also known as cheops. \" this anomaly is really quite impressive and it's just in front of us, at the ground level, \" says researcher mehdi tayoubi. He called the anomaly \" impressive and obvious \" but inconclusive. Antiquities minister mamdouh el-damaty was more specific: \" there is something like a small passage in the ground that you can see, leading up to the pyramids ground, reaching an area with a different temperature, \" he said, per the ap. \" what will be behind it? \" in this first phase of the scan pyramids project, a team from cairo university and the heritage, innovation and preservation organization explored the pyramids with technologies including a thermal camera. The idea was to see how pyramid stones heated up in the morning and cooled down in the evening, and big temperature differences between adjacent stones could indicate structural differences inside the pyramid. Led by tayoubi, researchers spotted a 6-degree difference in a block of stones on the ground level at cheops. \" we need now to build models and thermal simulations to test different hypotheses in order to understand what we have found, \" says tayoubi. The project is slated to continue next year with an infrared scan of the pyramids. ( also giving up potential secrets? king tut's tomb. )",

        "summary": "With its thumb raised skyward and a grin on its digital face, the robotic creation of two researchers in canada is about to start hitchhiking across the us. The humanoid robot named hitchbot has already caught rides across canada and in europe, relying on the kindness and curiosity of strangers. But today it starts its first us tour, setting out from salem, massachusetts, with dreams of san francisco ahead. Along the way, it hopes to see some quintessential american sites, including times square, mount rushmore, and the grand canyon. The kid-size robot speaks english and is immobile on its own, so it gets from place to place by being schlepped around by strangers. Travelers can pass it off to others they meet, or leave it at a gas station or shop. They can just leave it seated on its kickstand with its thumb raised. Ideally, the creators hope, drivers won't leave the bot along busy roads and will charge the battery when it runs low. Otherwise, there are no rules. \" we want to see what people do with this kind of technology when we leave it up to them, \" says frauke zeller, one of the creators and an assistant professor in professional communication at toronto's ryerson university. \" it's an art project in the wild — it invites people to participate. \" a gps in the robot can track its location, and a camera randomly snaps photos about every 20 minutes to document its travels. But the team behind the robot seeks permission from people in the photos before posting them to social media, where hitchbot has built a devoted fan base.

But that didn't happen, and comments from iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif cast doubts that agreement is near as the current round of talks enter their 14th day. By missing yesterday's target date, congress will now have 60 days, not 30, to decide whether it will ok any deal. Said deal would offer iran sanctions relief in exchange for long-term and verifiable curbs on nuclear programs, but president obama can't waive sanctions during that now 60-day period. Iran is unlikely to begin a substantial rollback of its nuclear program until it gets sanctions relief in return. How much more time is needed is still unclear, but an iranian official tells the bbc this isn't \" the 11th hour, but [ the ] 13th or 14th. \" us secretary of state john kerry had warned yesterday that the americans were ready to leave, declaring \" we can't wait forever for a decision to be made, \" though, per the bbc, he also noted that \" the work here is incredibly technical and...

The complaint, brought in the u.s. District court for the northern district of california, alleges that purina failed to disclose that beneful contains substances that are toxic to animals, including industrial grade glycols ( igg ), lead, arsenic and mycotoxins. The food and drug administration ( fda ) categorizes pharmaceutical grade propylene glycol as generally recognized as safe ( gras ) for ingestion; however, the fda prohibits the use of igg in food products due to concerns over contamination and impurities in the manufacturing process. In addition, the association for truth in pet food conducted independent testing of beneful original dog food and found that it contained mycotoxins, toxins produced by fungus that occurs in grains, which are a principal ingredient",

C-15-0569 emc ) was filed late yesterday against nestlé purina petcare company on behalf of consumers who purchased beneful brand dog food and had pets suffer from internal organ distress, injury, or failure and death. The complaint, brought in the u.s. District court for the northern district of california, alleges that purina failed to disclose that beneful contains substances that are toxic to animals, including industrial grade glycols ( igg ), lead, arsenic and mycotoxins. The food and drug administration ( fda ) categorizes pharmaceutical grade propylene glycol as generally recognized as safe ( gras ) for ingestion; however, the fda prohibits the use of igg in food products due to concerns over contamination and impurities in the manufacturing process. In addition, the association for truth in pet food conducted independent testing of beneful original dog food and found that it contained mycotoxins, toxins produced by fungus that occurs in grains, which are a principal ingredient",

            "Pet food giant purina launched a national campaign in support of its beneful brand last week — just as an ongoing lawsuit against the brand expanded its allegations that the popular feed is making dogs sick. The amended complaint against nestlé purina petcare company's beneful dry kibble dog food was filed on june 8 in california federal court, adding 26 additional pet owners from states spanning coast to coast. The lawsuit now alleges that beneful contains toxins and that purina has been offering cash settlements in exchange for silence from those who voice complaints about the brand. The amendments to the suit come on the heels of a national campaign launched by purina last week defending its products. The \" i stand behind beneful \" campaign features a full-page advertisement in the new york times and a tv commercial showing workers who both make beneful and feed it to their own pets, the company said. \" this really boils down to the fact that we're really proud of the beneful product and there are no issues with the quality, \" keith schopp"

He helped to eliminate jim crow laws, changing the country permanently.

And all of that makes king \" the most significant american since lincoln. \" and his speech is one of the rare ones that has the power to \" echo across generations, \" declares a guardian editorial. That's because it spoke, powerfully, to both black and white listeners. And though \" the dream remains unfinished business, \" that fact simply \" reinforces the power of that moment when dr. King found the words to make people be better than they were, and the speech's enduring power to inspire. \" in the washington post, martin luther king iii agrees that his father's work is not yet done. \" too many americans have inadequate opportunities to escape poverty, joblessness, discrimination, social neglect, and violence, \" he writes, and \" african-american youth still have good reason to fear racially motivated violence. \" he concludes with a simple question: \" what is each and every one of us doing to realize the dream of freedom, justice, and equality for all? \" click for more on the celebration of king's speech.",

Yes, i am absolutely interested in discussing ideological issues with you, and am thinking about how we can work together. \" forts praises breivik's \" moral conscience, \" calling him a \" nationalist and a patriot, and not the terrorist neo-nazi that the media portrays him to be, \" reports der spiegel. He admits that breivik's killing of 77 people, mostly teenagers, was \" atrocious but necessary, \" though it doesn't need to be repeated. \" i believe, \" at some point in the future, \" it will be impossible to hate breivik, and you will see that he was actually acting in a matter of preemptive war, \" adds forts, who says his perspective is unique in his community. But forts isn't entirely alone in his admiration of breivik. The killer has received more than 100 letters of support from sweden, russia, germany, and britain, according to his most recent psychological report. \" these letters contain the same political views held by the defendant, \" said a prison report. Says breivik: \" i welcome these letters from people who share the same opinion, and with whom i can work together in the future. \" check out forts ' videotaped interview on breivik with vg here.",

Why? \" says renee rabinowitz, a retired lawyer.

The israel religious action center, a liberal advocacy group, has been waiting for the right case to come along in order to sue el al for discrimination, and it found that case with rabinowitz. When a flight attendant offered her a new seat, she briefly argued with the other passenger before giving in and moving. The lawsuit claims she felt pressured by the flight attendant. Upon hearing about the lawsuit, el al offered rabinowitz a $ 200 discount on her next flight. They're going to court instead. \"the idea of having a [ ultra-orthodox ] population is wonderful, as long as they don't tell me what to do, \" rabinowitz says.",

Do they say too soon? \" ripa even gave him a going-away present: a set of bronzed high heels, per usa today. \" nobody rocks a size-16 stiletto better than you, \" she said.

The country has granted nine permits to hunt the large beasts, of which the conservation action trust says only 100 exist.

With 20,000 elephants within its borders and 391 in the area where the hunt will occur, elephants are \" no longer rare... But only potentially valuable, \" the ministry maintains. As for reports that the permits are being offered in exchange for political votes, it says that is \" inaccurate, false. \" while it's true desert elephants aren't a unique species, they \" possess a number of unique behaviors shared by no other african elephants, such as digging wells to purify their drinking water, \" and have both thinner bodies and wider feet, writes john platt at scientific american.

The measure, which allows people over 21 to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana, is a win for legalization advocates but may not make life any easier for the city's tokers: state law allows marijuana for medical use only and portland's police chief says he plans to keep enforcing state law. In other ballot measures: new york state will be getting seven new casinos, including one in new york city, after voters approved a constitutional amendment. The measure was helped by ballot wording that strongly emphasized the potential for job creation and didn't mention the downsides of gambling, the new york times notes. Michigan voters in ferndale, jackson, and lansing legalized the possession of small amounts of pot, while colorado voters voted to slap a 25 % tax on the state's already-legal marijuana to fund school construction. The denver post rounds up local marijuana tax measures across the state. In new jersey, where chris christie easily won a second term, voters decided to raise the minimum wage by $ 1 to $ 8.25 and join 10 other states in adding automatic cost-of-living increases, the ap reports. In houston, meanwhile, the iconic but long-closed astrodome was the night's big loser. Voters rejected a plan to turn the 48-year-old stadium into a convention center and it will probably now be demolished.",

Apple has reinvented the tablet to create \" one of the best computers ever, gushes andy ihnatko at the chicago sun-times. The user experience is \" instantly compelling and elegant, \" he writes. \" it's a computer that's designed for speed, mobility, and tactile interaction above all other considerations. \" apple has \" pretty much nailed it, \" with this formidable rival to netbooks, the kindle, and portable game machines, writes edward baig at usa today, noting that the ipad will run just about all of the 150,000 iphone apps available.

History of cider it is thought that cider was well known by the hebrews, egyptians and greeks. Plinio ( 23-79 ad ) speaks of drinks done with pears and apples and mentions wine, \" … is the typical drink of the territory \"; estrabon, about 60 years before christ, writes that the astures used cider because they had little wine while palladium ( 3rd century ), finds that the romans prepared pear wine and included production details. The first evidence about cider made in asturies was from the greek geographer strabo in 60 bc. Sidra ( cider ) from the espana verde region of spain dates to the end of the 11th century when the area was unfavorable for grape cultivation. Farmers planted apple orchards instead of grapes and started cider production. Over time, asturias and the basque region developed a strong cider tradition and now the area defines spanish cider with asturias responsible for more than 80 percent of the entire production. The residents of the principality of asturias consume 54 liters ( 14.26 gallons ) per person per year"

U.s. Education secretary betsy devos testifies before the labor, health and human services, education, and related agencies subcommittee of the senate appropriations committee on capitol hill in washington, d.c. June 6, 2017. Reuters/aaron p. Bernstein last month devos pressed pause on the rules, due to take effect on july 1, saying they needed to be reset. Massachusetts, 17 other states and the district of columbia said in a filing in u.s. District court in washington, d.c. The department broke federal law in announcing the delay with limited public notice and opportunity to comment. Devos, a republican, has said accelerating the debt cancellation process would put taxpayers on the hook for significant costs, and a delay is needed while current litigation in california over the rules works through the legal system. \"with this ideologically driven suit, the state attorneys general are saying to regulate first, and ask the legal questions later, \" said education department press secretary liz hill in a statement, adding the rules were adopted \"through a heavily politicized process. \" consumer groups public citizen and project on predatory student lending sued on thursday to lift the delay as well. The rules were finalized in the last days of the administration of president barack obama, a democrat who overhauled federal student lending. After corinthian, a for-profit chain, collapsed in 2015 amid government investigations into its post-graduation employment rates, the administration began drafting rules to help students caught with outstanding loans they had taken out for corinthian tuition.

            "Washington ( reuters ) - more than one-third of u.s. States on thursday sued the u.s. Education department and secretary betsy devos over the recent suspension of rules that would have swiftly canceled the student-loan debt of people defrauded by corinthian colleges inc and other for-profit schools. U.s. Education secretary betsy devos testifies before the labor, health and human services, education, and related agencies subcommittee of the senate appropriations committee on capitol hill in washington, d.c. June 6, 2017. Reuters/aaron p. Bernstein last month devos pressed pause on the rules, due to take effect on july 1, saying they needed to be reset. Massachusetts, 17 other states and the district of columbia said in a filing in u.s. District court in washington, d.c. The department broke federal law in announcing the delay with limited public notice and opportunity to comment. Devos, a republican, has said accelerating the debt cancellation process would put taxpayers on the hook for significant costs, and a delay is needed while current litigation in california over the rules works through the legal system. \"with this ideologically driven suit, the state attorneys general are saying to regulate first, and ask the legal questions later, \" said education department press secretary liz hill in a statement, adding the rules were adopted \"through a heavily politicized process. \" consumer groups public citizen and project on predatory student lending sued on thursday to lift the delay as well. The rules were finalized in the last days of the administration of president barack obama, a democrat who overhauled federal student lending. After corinthian, a for-profit chain, collapsed in 2015 amid government investigations into its post-graduation employment rates, the administration began drafting rules to help students caught with outstanding loans they had taken out for corinthian tuition. Wanting to keep students from getting loans they could not repay, obama specifically targeted for-profit, career colleges that promise students they",

        "summary": "Jurors trying to assess the truthfulness of defense lawyer stephen gutierrez's closing arguments in an arson trial wednesday may have been dismayed to notice that his pants were literally on fire. Witnesses say the lawyer had to flee the miami courtroom with smoke billowing from his pocket, the miami herald reports. When he returned, the lawyer, who'd been seen fiddling in his pocket, blamed a faulty e-cigarette battery. Gutierrez said the pocket blaze wasn't an attempt to demonstrate the innocence of his client, who was accused of setting his own car on fire. Gutierrez argued that the vehicle spontaneously combusted, but his client was ultimately convicted of second-degree arson. Prosecutors are investigating the courtroom incident, and the judge could hold gutierrez in contempt of court if he was found to be staging a stunt, the herald reports. The bizarre incident already is making headlines in lawyer blogs and overseas newspapers. \" i swear this is not a lawyer joke, \" was the npr intro to the nugget. And cnet notes that the lawyer has declined to respond to the media's requests for comment, which \" leaves several burning questions unanswered. \" ( the owner of this jeep can probably sympathize. )",

Folse was also booked with illegal discharge of a firearm and two counts of drug possession after investigators found undisclosed narcotics at her home in the 8900 block of camille drive in river ridge. \" this is crazy, a veterinarian shooting a dog of her next door neighbor. This is nuts. I don't know how else to put it, \" lopinto said. Folse is accused of shooting bruizer, a 15-month-old american bull dog that belongs to her next-door neighbor, on the afternoon of dec. 13. Bruizer's owner, stacey fitzner, told fox 8 that she'd left the pup in the backyard of her home when she went to work. But a relative returned home to find bruizer lying in the grass with a gunshot wound to the back of his head. It was clear, fitzner said, that someone pushed open the gate to her backyard and shot her dog. The family coincidentally took bruizer to abadie veterinary hospital in harahan, the clinic where folse works, lopinto said. She was not the treating vet, he noted. Folse was not at the business when bruizer arrived. The dog did not survive his injuries, according to authorities. Sheriff's office investigators spoke to bruizer's owners, who shared a series of hostile text messages and videos from folse, who was complaining about the dog's constant barking, according to lopinto. \" he ( bruizer's owner ) believed and suspected that she may have had something to do with it, \" lopinto said. Deputies eventually secured a search warrant for folse's home and found the narcotics tuesday. They have not yet recovered a weapon. Folse was taken into custody tuesday. She was fired from the veterinary hospital, lopinto said. Folse was being booked into the jefferson parish correctional center in gretna. No bond information was available."

        "summary": "The former lead and zinc mining boomtown of picher, okla., has seen better days. It swelled to some 14,000 residents when bullet demand rose during both world war i and ii, with wired reporting previously that \" most \" of the lead found in bullets used by america during those wars came from the town. Piles of chat — a white grit that results from lead extraction — rose as high as 150 feet and as wide as four football fields, reports kfsm, which says picher \" may be the biggest environmental disaster you've never heard of. \" last year, nbc news noted that the town's toxicity levels were higher than those found at new york's love canal site. But even after the epa declared the town a superfund site in 1983, residents continued filling their children's sandboxes with chat. \" we would ride our bikes up and down the chat piles, \" former resident john clarke tells kfsm. Little wonder, then, that roughly two decades ago, 63 % of children were experiencing lead poisoning, reports wired. In 2005, the government relocated some residents, paying them an average of $ 55 per square foot to get out. Picher's last straw was when a tornado destroyed much of what was left of the town in 2008. The police and town government stopped operating a year later, and nbc news reports that picher-cardin high school that year graduated its last class — of 11 students. And while three hardy souls have been identified as still living in its confines by kfsm, looters have raided anything of value left in the town. Meanwhile, 1,000 migrating birds were found dead in picher earlier this year, likely wiped out from zinc poisoning. \" it's a little depressing every morning when i come into work, \" admits clarke of the drive into picher; he turned the former city hall into a museum to memorialize what once was.

        "summary": "Wednesday night's fiesty democratic debate in florida was the last one on the schedule, but analysts say the biggest takeaway from the hillary clinton-bernie sanders clash is that these two are going to keep the battle up for a long time, possibly until june. Commentators are split on whether to declare it a draw, a sanders win, or a clinton win. A roundup of reaction: this was sanders ' best chance to change the course of the race and keep momentum going after his upset win in michigan, but he couldn't get a game changer, despite an impressive effort, according to aaron blake at the washington post, who really liked sanders ' brown suit. Clinton, meanwhile, \" avoided a disaster and came out as the better debater, yet again, \" he writes. Dan balz at the washington post writes that with tense exchanges over issues such as immigration, climate change, and the auto bailout, nothing was settled, but the stage was set for a \" grueling and increasingly contentious battle that could continue until the primaries end in june. \" the democratic race, he writes, is now starting to resemble 2008 — but with clinton now in obama's shoes, and sanders in clinton's former role as the \" dogged challenger hanging in against long odds. \" sanders displayed his \" political steel \" in this debate, where transcripts reveal a \" metronomic recitation of succinct anti-clinton attack phrases repeated over and over and over with deadly, aw-shucks efficiency, \" writes glenn thrush at politico, who calls the debate a draw. Matthew yglesias at vox declares sanders the winner, partly because the moderators were more focused on clinton's weaknesses and partly because sanders is \" making policy commitments that are well to the left of where the obama administration is while downplaying the idea of a sharp break between himself and the popular incumbent president. \" one thing became very clear wednesday night: clinton and sanders are really starting to get under each other's skin, according to ben kamisar at the hill, who notes that sanders seems likely to continue his attacks on clinton's paid wall street speeches — and is now calling for superdelegates to switch sides.

Now a study published tuesday in current biology offers some scientific evidence to back that feeling up. Fugazza and her team used a training method she developed call \" do as i do \" to get dogs to mimic human actions, such as touching an umbrella. Their method is detailed in this video. In short, researchers showed dogs could replicate an action they weren't specifically trained to do, weren't shown was important, and hadn't ever physically done themselves, the guardian reports. More than a third of dogs tested were able to replicate a human's action an hour later. And while fugazza won't go so far as to say dogs have episodic memory — memory tied to a specific time and place — she does conclude they have \" episodic-like memory. \" \" episodic memory is traditionally linked to self-awareness, \" fugazza tells npr. \" so far there is no evidence of self awareness in dogs, and i think there is no method for testing it. \" however, the fact that only some of the dogs tested could replicate a human's action, even just a minute later, could be evidence that they aren't actually remembering things, the washington post reports.

Humans have episodic memory, and that's pretty easy to prove, because we can use our words to describe the past events we recall. Demonstrating that animals have it is much more difficult. But now researchers in hungary say they've found evidence that dogs have episodic-like memory ( they added the \"like \" because they acknowledge they cannot get inside a dog's head to absolutely confirm this ), specifically when it comes to remembering what their owners do. Even more interesting is that they can",

Humans have episodic memory, and that's pretty easy to prove, because we can use our words to describe the past events we recall. Demonstrating that animals have it is much more difficult. But now researchers in hungary say they've found evidence that dogs have episodic-like memory ( they added the \"like \" because they acknowledge they cannot get inside a dog's head to absolutely confirm this ), specifically when it comes to remembering what their owners do.

Heavy rainfall, destructive winds, and battering waves were threatening heavily populated rural and urban regions, where the philippine weather agency raised typhoon warnings, stranding thousands of people in ports as airlines canceled flights and ferries were grounded. Officials warned of storm surges in coastal villages, flash floods and landslides, and asked villagers to evacuate. Christmas is the biggest holiday in the philippines, which has asia's largest roman catholic population, making it difficult to get people's attention. Gov. Miguel villafuerte of camarines sur province, which is in the typhoon's forecast path, offered roast pigs, a popular christmas delicacy locally called \" lechon, \" in evacuation centers to entice villagers. \" i know it's christmas...

Outside the center, a path along the plane's route leads to what pbs describes as \" two 40-foot-high walls meant to mimic the shape of an airplane wing. \" a boulder stands at the impact site. Inside, displays tell the story of 9/11 and show recovered fragments from the plane. One display allows visitors to listen to some of the 37 calls made from the flight, including heartbreaking farewells to loved ones, the post reports. \" i just love you and i just wanted to tell you that. I don't know if i ' m going to get the chance to tell you that again or not, \" passenger linda gronlund tells her sister in one recording. Including the messages was a controversial choice, but the pittsburgh post-gazette editorial board says it was the right call because the voicemails, \" while intended for family members, also convey a message to the world: that love prevails even in chaos and tragedy. \"",

The navy times reports on the surprising first, which came about following the decision to make every \" head \" gender-neutral. That will reportedly make it easier for the navy to pivot and change the corresponding berthing area to housing female sailors versus male and vice versa as the makeup of deployments change. The decision to eliminate them from carriers was made in 2012, per a cnn piece published at the time, which noted urinal drain pipes are more likely to clog, increasing both maintenance costs and unpleasant odors. Those are the pros. The cons, according to design experts, are that toilets eat up more space than urinals do and are much less sanitary. As one such expert explains, men are more likely to miss their mark in a toilet, meaning urine more likely to accumulate on the floor. But it's a done deal, regardless: president trump commissioned the warship on saturday in norfolk, virginia, but the ap reports deployment isn't nigh: sea trials finished up in april, but a battery of at-sea tests and workups are next required and could take more than four years to finish.

More than 350 french police officers and soldiers are searching for chekatt but it's not clear whether he is still in the country: according to french media, he escaped from the scene in a taxi and fled to a district near the border with germany. Authorities say chekatt has served time in prisons in both france and germany and was expelled to france from the latter country in 2017. Authorities say hours before chekatt opened fire, authorities went to his home to arrest him in connection with an armed robbery and attempted murder, the guardian reports. He was not at home, but explosives were found at the address and five other people were arrested. Chekatt was on a security watchlist, although deputy interior minister laurent nunez said no motive for the attack had been established, the telegraph reports. \" the hunt is taking place and the priority is to find this attacker, \" nunez told reporters.

            "Image copyright police nationale ( france ) french police have appealed for help in finding a man suspected of a christmas market gun attack in strasbourg that killed three people, and left a fourth brain dead and 12 others wounded. Hundreds of security personnel are searching for cherif chekatt, 29, on both sides of the franco-german border. The suspect had a string of criminal convictions and had become a radical islamist while in prison. Police say he is highly dangerous and should not be approached. French officials announced on thursday that a third person had died in the aftermath of the strasbourg attack. Five people were seriously wounded, they said, including a man described as brain dead. Why are searches taking place in germany? chekatt has been in jail in germany as well as france, and german reports suggested he may have received a call from germany shortly before the strasbourg attack. He did not answer the call, but investigators were trying to establish who was behind it, rbb inforadio reported.

But at slate, jordan weissmann writes that the night didn't start out that way at all: the first question was on trade, and trump \" absolutely savaged \" a seemingly ill-prepared clinton on the topic. Among other things, he noted that she now supports the trans pacific partnership, a pact she lauded as the \" gold standard \" while secretary of state. Clinton tried to dodge: \" i was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out, \" she said. But fact-checker politifact looks at her original \" gold standard \" statement in 2012 and sides with trump here. Trump also bashed nafta, signed by bill clinton, as perhaps the worst trade deal ever and said hillary clinton's policies have cost america jobs for decades. \" you've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? \" when clinton interjected, he said, \" i will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs. \" right-wing breitbart news highlights the exchange with a headline saying trump \" bludgeoned \" her on the topic, but the sentiment is on the left, too: progressive cenk uygur tweeted, \" trump scores on \" you haven't done it in 30 years \" and nafta and tpp. She's losing right now. \" ( real clear politics has a transcript of the exchange. ) she seemed flat-footed, writes weissmann, who suggests a new approach for the clinton camp, one that involves painting trump as more concerned about the elite than the middle class: \" how can you can trust a man who runs his business that way, by stepping on small businesses. \"",

            "An employee walks into an office of french drugmaker sanofi in shanghai august 2, 2013. New york sanofi and eli lilly and co on wednesday said they would ask health regulators for permission to sell cialis, the world's top-selling anti-impotence drug, without a prescription. Currently available by prescription only, the tablet was first approved by the european medicines agency in 2002 and then by the u.s. Food and drug administration in 2003. It is one of lilly's biggest products, having generated almost $ 2.2 billion in worldwide sales last year. The drug is also approved to treat enlarged prostate glands. Under the terms of the agreement, sanofi is buying the exclusive rights to apply for approval of cialis tablets over the counter in the united states, europe, canada and australia. Terms of the licensing agreement were not disclosed. The tablet would be sold by sanofi's consumer healthcare unit, which had sales last year of $ 4.1 billion from a wide array of non-prescription brands, including vitamins and treatments for allergies, coughs, colds and the flu. It remains to be seen, however, whether regulators will allow cialis to be sold without a prescription, in view of possible side effects. Like rival anti-impotence drugs, such as pfizer inc's viagra, cialis can cause a dangerous fall in blood pressure if taken with nitrates, a class of heart drugs that include nitroglycerin. The u.s. Food and drug administration, in weighing whether to allow prescription drugs to be sold over the counter, weighs whether patients are able to understand complex aspects of their disease, or exactly when to take the drug to ensure safe use. The fda in 2008, for instance, rejected merck &amp; co's bid to sell its mevacor cholesterol-lowering drug without a prescription, after an independent panel of medical experts expressed concern that patients might take it instead of more-effective newer medicines. Cialis will face competition from cheaper generics in the united states in 2017, the same year that teva pharmaceuticals industries is expected to begin selling generic prescription forms of viagra under an agreement reached with pfizer last year.

Before being arrested in mexico on monday, ethan couch and his mom tonya stayed a few nights at the los tules resort in puerto vallarta, where their behavior was odd, to say the least. A resort employee tells the dallas morning news that ethan went to a \" gentleman's club \" one night but didn't have enough money to cover his tab. She says a club manager and waiter brought him back to the resort, where she had to wake up his mother to pay his bill. The mother-son duo also apparently forgot to take their gun out of the nightstand when they switched rooms, according to abc news. It was found by the next guest, and ethan had to retrieve it from resort staff. The resort employee offers another odd tidbit: \" i knew them only as the texans because that's the only thing they'd tell me when i asked for their names: ' we're from texas. ' \" they also failed to complete hotel registrations or show their id, and paid in cash. When they did partially complete registration forms, ethan appeared to misspell his own name as \" edthan, \" according to abc. Ethan and tonya reportedly brought their large dog to the resort with them. And according to cbs dfw, the pooch may have helped them avoid immediate deportation. \" the couches claimed [ the dog ] was wrongfully taken from them and therefore their arrest, they claimed, was unlawful, \" cbs states. It didn't work for long. Tonya was deported wednesday, and ethan's deportation is on the horizon.",

Then nascar driver kurt busch shook things up, announcing that his ex, patricia driscoll — who alleged he had smashed her head into a motor-home wall — was actually a trained assassin who traveled the world to carry out deadly missions. The first part of that hearing was in december, but busch was back in delaware family court yesterday, adding that driscoll had shown busch photos of bodies with gunshot wounds and mentioned that a character in the movie zero dark thirty was a composite of her and other women, the ap reports. More busch allegations that emerged: that driscoll had murdered drug lords using long-range sniper rifles, as well as at close range with knives and poison, the news journal reports. Busch even says that one night in el paso, texas, driscoll left in camouflage attire and came back with a trenchcoat over a blood-spattered gown. Kevin draper points out on deadspin that driscoll has an \" interesting background \" that makes busch's claims seem \" vaguely possible \": she's president of the nonprofit armed forces foundation, which helps military service members; owner of frontline defense systems, which sells military equipment; and star of the \" pocket commando \" video, in which one of her workers calls her \" baby rambo. \" \" these statements made are ludicrous and... Are an attempt to destroy my credibility, \" driscoll tells the ap, adding, \" i find it interesting that some of the outlandish claims come straight from a fictional movie script i've been working on for eight years. \" ( sneak a peek at a north korean assassin's arsenal of everyday objects. )",

There was no indication anyone survived the crash of the tu-154, which belonged to the defense ministry and was taking the alexandrov ensemble to a new year's concert at the hemeimeem air base in syria's coastal province of latakia. Crews recovered several bodies and ships, and helicopters and drones were searching the area for more. A total of 84 passengers and eight crew members were on the plane when it disappeared from radars two minutes after taking off in good weather, reports the ap. Emergency crews found fragments less than a mile from shore. A defense affairs committee rep said the crash could have been caused by a technical malfunction or a crew error, but believes it could not have been terrorism because the plane was operated by the military. \" i totally exclude \" the idea of an attack bringing down the plane, he said, per the state ria novosti news agency. The passenger list included 64 members of the alexandrov ensemble. The ensemble is the official choir of the russian military. Also on board was yelizaveta glinka, a russian doctor who has won wide acclaim for her charity work that included missions to war zones in eastern ukraine and syria. Her foundation said that glinka was accompanying a shipment of medicines for a hospital in syria. Nine russian journalists were also among the passengers. The tu-154 is a soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. The plane that crashed was built in 1983, and underwent repairs in 2014. In 2010, a tu-154 carrying polish president lech kaczynski and 95 others crashed while trying to land in bad weather at a sporadically used military airport in smolensk in western russia, killing everyone on board.

        "summary": "America's opioid epidemic is getting worse, not better, according to an alarming new report from the centers for disease control and prevention. The tuesday report shows opioid overdoses that led to emergency room visits across the country jumped 30 % from july 2016 to september 2017. In the midwest, overdoses jumped 70 %, due in part to increases of 109 % in wisconsin and 65.5 % in illinois, report npr and cnn. Emergency room overdoses also jumped 40 % in the west, 21 % in the northeast — tied to increases of 105 % in delaware and 81 % in pennsylvania — 20 % in the southwest, and 14 % in the southeast. \" we saw, sadly, that in every region, in every age group of adults, in both men and women, overdoses from opioids are increasing, \" acting cdc director anne schuchat tells npr, pointing out the crisis may be worse than the data suggest. That's partly because many overdoses occur away from hospitals. But cnn reports the increases in emergency room overdoses in the west and southwest weren't expected and \" might foreshadow death trends to come, \" as one overdose increases a person's chance of a second. \" we really think that this is a wake-up call for all of us — that the opioid epidemic is in all of our communities and that there's more that we need to do, \" says schuchat. Opioid researcher andrew kolodny agrees on that point, telling npr there's \" a recognition that we need to do something about this problem. But nothing yet has happened. \" while calling for increased funding for addiction treatment, kolodny compares the trump administration's labeling of the crisis as an emergency to a person pointing out a house on fire, \" then not calling the fire department. \"",

        "summary": "It's common knowledge that stress can lead to a heart attack, but scientists have never actually known how — until now. It turns out that when you're stressed, your body starts overproducing white blood cells, or leukocytes, as if you had a wound or infection, researchers from the harvard medical school reveal in a study published yesterday. Those excess cells can then crowd artery walls, restricting blood flow and making a deadly clot more likely, the afp explains. \" it makes sense that stress wakes up these immune cells because an enlarged production of leukocytes prepares you for danger, such as in a fight, where you might be injured, \" co-author matthias nahrendorf tells science. The team began by taking blood samples from medical residents both while they were working in intensive care and while they were off-duty, and discovered that the stressed-out residents had higher white blood cell counts. They then verified the link to heart disease via experiments in mice. If that weren't enough to convince you to chill out, recent research has also shown a link between stress and memory loss, cnn reports. While acute stress ( say, from a car accident ) can sharpen your mental faculties and preserve a traumatic memory, low-level anxiety ( like on-going job stress ) harmed subjects'synapses.

His take on \" the complicated emotional bond between city and team \" here. Got questions? espn has an exhaustive faq on how the move came about here. Why did miami dolphins owner stephen ross vote against the move? likely because he's concerned about the idea of a team's \" legacy \" in a certain city, nesn explains.

Marilyn roberts tells yahoo people should wash their sheets once per week \" as long as there's no bodily secretions or any potential risk factors. \" and oh, what risk factors there are. Roberts says sheets should be changed immediately if any of the following gross things hit the bed: urine, diarrhea, fecal spray, vomit, or drainage from an ear infection. Sweaty sleepers may also want to change their sheets more often to ensure they're drying properly, as bacteria grows more quickly in warmer, moister environments. In case that wasn't enough to scare you, yahoo reports some skin infections can jump from people to sheets and back to people. Good housekeeping also pushes the preference for weekly washing — two weeks, max — because of all the \" germs, sweat, and body oils \" that accumulate. ( bonus advice: a common mistake is overdrying sheets, causing them to shrink, it notes. ) roberts says people who are obese, swimmers, or elderly — along with anyone else more prone to skin infections than the general population — should pay closer attention to the cleanliness of their sheets. And, of course, even well-washed pets aren't making sheets any cleaner. \"pets should be pets — they should have their own bed because they can be a reservoir for human diseases. \" gq makes it unanimous in pushing the once-a-week advice, because \" there's no point in diligently washing your clothes if you're sleeping in dirty sheets at the end of the day. \" ( this man has gone 12 years without bathing. )",

        "summary": "A maryland congressman who meant to take a stand against looser marijuana laws in washington, dc, might end up making them even looser thanks to the legal fine print in his amendment. The washington post lays out the somewhat convoluted scenario surrounding republican andy harris ' legislation: to begin with, recall that dc's city council voted earlier this year to make possession of small amounts of pot punishable by only a $ 25 fine. Harris, who thinks that measure is a bad idea and wants to block it from taking effect, tacked an amendment onto a house spending bill that would forbid dc from spending any money to \"enact or carry out any law, rule, or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use, or distribution \" of marijuana. The problem? dc's law takes effect in july, and murray's legislation will take much longer than that to wind through the house and senate. Which means it could take effect after dc's law is on the books. \" by blocking the recently enacted law without replacing it with a new one, harris ' rider effectively leaves the district with no operative law concerning the possession of small amounts of marijuana, \" explains raw story. As the dcist points out, it's highly unlikely that the harris amendment would eventually pass the house and senate, and then escape a presidential veto. But just in case, the dc attorney general's office is looking into the possible ramifications, says the post. \"this potential unintended consequence only underscores why congress should not meddle in local dc laws, \" says a spokesperson for mayor vincent gray.",

        "summary": "Multiple system atrophy, or msa, is a rare and horrible disease that will destroy your brain and inevitably kill you, and the study of it has now yielded a major breakthrough in our understanding of brain diseases. Researchers have discovered that msa is caused by a prion, a kind of deformed protein that spreads like a virus and is known to cause creutzfeldt-jakob disease in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( aka mad cow disease ) in cattle, reports the san francisco chronicle. The university of california, san francisco scientists say alpha-synuclein is the first new kind of prion to be identified \" since the discovery a half century ago that cjd was transmissible, \" they write in proceedings of the national academy of sciences. The scientists injected alpha-synuclein taken from the brains of 14 people who died from msa into mice; npr reports the animals were dead within about four months, and the dead creatures ' brains \" looked exactly like \" those of the humans killed by msa. The find lends support to the idea that \" misfolded \" prions could be behind more common brain diseases like parkinson's and alzheimer's. No cure currently exists for prion-caused diseases, which are generally spread by eating brains or eating animals that have eaten brains. But the find could help fight msa, which acts like a more aggressive version of parkinson's and affects up to 50,000 americans at any time, nbc news reports. And while one prion expert says the research \" suggests msa does not transmit easily, \" study author kurt giles says \" protein sticks very tightly to the stainless steel \" and standard disinfecting may not kill prions, meaning it's possible msa could be spread by contaminated surgical instruments. ( eating brains nearly wiped out this tribe in papua new guinea. )",

Bond next found bella lifeless, her face swollen and gray, with mccarthy standing over her, assistant da david deakin told a court yesterday. \" she was a demon and it was her time to die, \" mccarthy told bond, then threatened to kill her if she went to police, deakin said. After putting bella's body in the fridge for up to a month, per nbc news, mccarthy dumped it at south boston's waterfront, deakin said, adding the pair then went on a days-long heroin binge. The graphic claims led to outbursts in court. After the girl's godmother stormed out, yelling \" i hope you rot in hell, \" bella's father followed, saying, \" michael mccarthy, you're done. \" deakin also told the court that a man who had stayed with the couple was the first to approach police. Bond reportedly told michael sprinsky that she'd stopped using drugs, which sprinsky said would help her regain custody of bella, whom he thought was with the department of children and families. Sprinsky said bond then broke down and told him about the murder. When sprinsky's sister told him about the baby doe case, sprinsky texted mccarthy: \" baby doe ring a bell? \" mccarthy denied bella was dead, deakin said. During his arrest, he \" continued to maintain that bella was in dcf custody and that's all he knew, \" deakin added.

Brown university scientists detected large quantities of water \" glass beads \" trapped in ancient volcanic deposits across the moon's surface, indicating there's far more water deep below the surface, space.com reports. \" it may be that the bulk interior of the moon is wet, \" says lead author ralph milliken in a news release. He tells cnn the rock fields span thousands of square miles and may be several miles deep. \" it's more water than previously recognized, \" he says. Until 2008, scientists believed the moon was largely a dry planet, but then trace amounts of water were detected in glass beads from rock deposits collected during the apollo 15 and 17 missions. It was not known if the beads were an anomaly until the current study, reported in the journal nature geoscience, which used satellite data to analyze most of the large deposits of lunar rock previously found. Milliken's team detected the presence of water in all of the deposits. How the water got there \" is still a big question, \" says co-author shuai li. Finding the answer could could shed light on the origins of the moon, which is believed to be the byproduct of a crash between earth and a massive comet or planet. The heat from such a collision was believed to have vaporized any hydrogen needed to form water. Extracting water from the beads could \" save future lunar explorers from having to bring lots of water from home, \" li says, adding that would be \" a big step forward. \" ( there was an auction of actual moon dust. )",

        "summary": "The first phase in the trial of accused boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev begins today, and it's expected to be a lengthy one. Six things to know: the first step is the selection of a jury of 12 ( plus six alternates ), in a process that will begin with a list of more than 1,200 names and could take as long as a month. The boston globe explains that would-be jurors will today begin filling out a survey designed to weed out those who should be excluded without any further questioning; the survey will also reveal their fitness to serve on a death panel jury — that's the sentence tsarnaev faces. Massachusetts struck down the death penalty roughly three decades ago and hasn't executed anyone since 1947. But the death penalty is at play in this case because tsarnaev is being tried in the federal court system ( a federal jury in the state has only considered the death penalty twice and handed it out once ). Of the 30 charges he faces, 17 are punishable by death. If he's found guilty ( the globe suspects a verdict won't come until late spring or early summer ), the second phase will be the sentencing one, in which a second full trial will occur. Jurors would need to be unanimous in handing down capital punishment. If they aren't, the judge would intervene and sentence tsarnaev to life in prison. Cnn reports that federal prosecutors and defense attorneys have failed to reach an agreement on a possible plea deal that could have seen tsarnaev receive life in exchange for pleading guilty; the roadblock was reportedly the doj's refusal to take the death penalty off the table. Defense attorney judy clarke, who hasn't commented, has in the past managed to secure plea deals for high-profile criminals, including \" unabomber \" ted kaczynski and gabrielle giffords'shooter jared loughner. Cnn describes her as an \" ardent opponent of the death penalty. \" in terms of the prosecution, us attorney carmen ortiz has tackled some high-profile cases, too, including that of mob boss james \" whitey \" bulger.",

A&e and espn are among the companies on board.

        "summary": "Robert mueller's russia investigation jumped back into the headlines wednesday with news of a pre-dawn raid at the home of former trump campaign manager paul manafort. Now politico reports that investigators appear to be trying to rattle manafort in another way, by approaching his son-in-law in a bid for cooperation. Jeffrey yohai has worked with manafort on various business deals, and the story points out that neither he nor manafort has been formally accused of any wrongdoing. It's not clear whether yohai agreed to any such cooperation, but the move shows that investigators are trying to get \" into manafort's head, \" says one of politico's sources. Related developments: \" climbing the ladder \": reaching out to a relative or some kind of lower-ring operative would be a tried-and-true investigative practice called \" climbing the ladder, \" notes the story. If, for example, investigators had turned up any kind of wrongdoing on, say, a tax form, related to yohai's business deals, they could offer him protection in exchange for information on his father-in-law. A \" gross abuse \": president trump's attorney fired off a scathing email calling the raid on manafort's home a \" gross abuse of the judicial process, \" per fox news. Chief counsel john dowd also questioned the validity of the search warrant, perhaps laying the ground for a future challenge of anything uncovered. He called it an \" invasion of privacy, \" adding that \" these methods are normally found and employed in russia, not america. \" change in tone: the aggressive email seems to reflect a shift in tone from the white house. Though trump has regularly called the russia investigation a witch hunt in public, he has also sent private messages to mueller, via dowd, expressing \" appreciation \" for mueller's work, usa today reported earlier this week. So why manafort? the washington post has a primer of sorts that runs through the reasons his house would be raided, including his brief role as trump's campaign manager, manafort's own ties to russia, and his participation in the controversial donald trump jr. Meeting. Manafort also faces allegations of money laundering and other financial misdeeds, and all those inquiries would now be under mueller's purview. In other words, the feds may be looking for leverage. About that warrant: a post at newsweek explains that mueller used a search warrant for the raid, not a mere grand jury subpoena that would have given manafort time to prepare. One theory is that mueller was worried manafort would destroy documents. Another is that mueller wanted to send a message",

        "summary": "Even by the less-than-happy-go-lucky standards of saltwater crocodiles, elvis is one cranky and aggressive critter. The 16-foot croc, apparently annoyed by the sound of workers cutting the grass in his enclosure at an australian reptile park, lunged at a lawnmower and dragged it into a pond. The croc, who lost two teeth in the encounter, \" drowned \" the mower and then sat watching his catch for an hour, the bbc reports. Park workers — who say their golden rule is to always keep the mower between themselves and the croc — retrieved the mangled mower after distracting elvis with kangaroo meat. Elvis, who is believed to be around 50 years old, has a history of anger management issues: he was captured in the wild after he attacked several fishing boats near darwin. After he ate two potential mates at a crocodile farm, he was moved to the reptile park, where workers now predict that his \" victory \" over the mower will turn him into even more of a handful. \" he's beaten us today — he's kingpin, \" the park's operations manager tells the telegraph. \" he's going to be walking around with his chest puffed out all day. \"",

        "summary": "Betsy devos cleared a major hurdle in the senate to become the next education secretary despite vigorous opposition from democrats. Senators voted 52-48 to cut off debate at dawn friday, setting the stage for a final confirmation vote next week on president trump's nominee, reports the ap. Two republican senators — susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska — have vowed to oppose her nomination, putting the expected late monday or tuesday vote at 50-50. Vice president pence would cast the deciding vote in the event of a tie. A look at other coverage of devos as the vote draws near: npr asks how devos became trump's \" least favorite cabinet pick, \" and answers it with four theories, ranging from the more commonly voiced ( questions about her preparedness ) to less ( is it a gender thing? ). Democratic sen. Maggie hassan explains why she ' ll be a \" nay \" vote on devos for the new york times, and the explanation is a personal one: her adult son ben has cerebral palsy, and she writes of the experience he had in attending public school. A counter-opinion: at the national review, jonathan tobin writes that history won't really end up remembering if a single trump cabinet nominee doesn't make it through, but the future, not history, is what's at stake here. \" devos ' presence at the department of education could begin moving the school-choice movement from the margins of the public square to its center. \" in a separate piece, the times looks at why the uproar over devos ' nomination is so \" remarkable \": \" by most any measure, the secretary of education is one of the least powerful cabinet positions, \" and it explains why. For starters, she'd be 16th in line for the presidency in the event something happened to trump. One pennsylvania teacher has started a gofundme campaign that's trying to \" buy \" a \" nay \" vote.",

Put together, they create an \" intimate and existential \" film \" about trauma, loss and grief, but also the careful creation of an american mythic icon. \" \" there's a mesmeric intensity to jackie that's unlike any biopic of its kind, marked by a deliberate effort to narrow the scope to one woman's actions and reactions over the course of a few fraught days, \" writes scott tobias at npr. \" larrain draws us into the utter uniqueness of a situation where personal loss and national duty collided so violently \" and relies \" on natalie portman's expressive face to tell much of the story. \" a \" transfixing \" portman \" will floor you with her tour de force as the former first lady, \" as she \" tops her oscar-winning role in black swan, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. The \" spellbinding \" movie is not only \" one of the year's best \" and \" impossible to forget, \" he adds, but it also \" offers a fuller picture than any standard biographical drama ever could. \" but kyle smith disagrees. \" jackie does more than a disservice — bordering on an insult — to its subject \" as it \" imposes upon 1963 a 21st-century notion of how famous people should emote on cue, \" he writes at the new york post.

            "I think there's a major point that kurtz is ignoring here, and it has less to do with the anti-limbaugh biases of the media than with the basic biases inherent in the news business. The narrative of the two major political parties has for decades been that the gop is the party of men, and the dems are the party of women. This is not just a media perception; in point of fact, women tend to be more closely aligned with the democratic party. Limbaugh's misogyny feeds that narrative, which means his anti-woman statements get more play than those coming from a left-wing pundit. ( for the same reason, if mitt romney makes yet another a wealth-related gaffe, it will get more attention than if newt gingrich or rick santorum were to say the same thing. ) the media is biased towards narratives, and unfortunately, the gop's narrative is that it's a party considerably less friendly to women.

        "summary": "Well, it looks like gawker won't be going down without a fight. Forbes reports gawker media is looking into suing billionaire archenemy peter thiel. Thiel claims he spent about $ 10 million funding multiple lawsuits against gawker — including hulk hogan's incredibly successful one — in an effort to punish the media company. Gawker has been critical of thiel for years, even outing him as gay in a 2007 blog post, according to cbs news. Now, gawker wants to know if thiel broke any laws when he funded those lawsuits. Its lawyers are specifically looking at possible racketeering or tortious interference, which forbes defines as \"the intentional interference of an outside party to damage a plaintiff's contractual or business relationships. \" while neither gawker nor peter thiel are commenting on a potential lawsuit, an anonymous source inside gawker confirmed to business insider the company is looking into one. After being ordered to pay hulk hogan $ 140 million for posting part of his sex tape, gawker filed for bankruptcy on friday. Gawker founder nick denton tweeted a thank you to thiel for the traffic boost the news brought. The company will continue to operate as normal while it looks for a buyer, but experts worry about the precedent being set by thiel's actions. \" you don't want billionaires to be any final arbiter of press fairness — that's just not democracy, \" a media analyst tells cbs.",

            "By ryan mac and matt drange gawker media is exploring options for litigation against peter thiel following the billionaire venture capitalist's secret funding of lawsuits against the media company. According to a source within gawker, the company's legal team is looking to see if thiel, who said he spent about $ 10 million funding other people's suits, violated any laws. \" the lawyers are exploring whether this could be a case of tortious interference, racketeering or other potential claims, \" said the source. Gawker's potential action against the early facebook investor and paypal cofounder comes after it filed for bankruptcy protection on friday. That followed the decision by a florida judge to deny gawker's request to stay a ruling that required it to pay $ 140 million to former wrestler hulk hogan. In march, a jury ruled that gawker had violated hogan's privacy by publishing a sex tape of him with his friend's wife and awarded him $ 115 million. The court later bolstered that amount by an additional $ 25 million for punitive damages. Forbes was the first to reveal that thiel had been secretly paying for the legal team behind hogan's lawsuits against gawker. Gawker declined to comment. A spokesperson for thiel also declined to comment. Tortious interference refers to the intentional interference of an outside party to damage a plaintiff's contractual or business relationships. For example, someone could make false accusations against an individual or group to harm or disrupt any future business. It's unclear how gawker's lawyers will pursue such action, but the source noted that because thiel may have funded suits in different states, it may take some time to understand what legal action would be possible. Thiel has paid the beverly hills, calif.-based law firm of harder mirell &amp; abrams to represent hogan, whose real name is terry bollea, in at least two suits in florida's pinellas county. That firms also represents cases against gawker in new york and boston, though thiel, who has a law degree from stanford university, has not revealed if his money is tied to either of those suits.

And what they saw could lead to a better understanding not only of these cells but of the antibodies that can eliminate them. The researchers, who have published their findings in the american journal of cancer research and plos one, discovered that cancerous cells actively pull healthy cells into tumors, according to a press release. Moreover, just 5 % of cancerous cells are required to form a tumor, a previously unknown figure. \" it's not like things are sticking to each other, \" researcher david soll says. \" these cells go out and actively recruit. \" researchers found that individual cancer cells — such as those from lung, skin, and brain cancers — extend themselves outward in search of other cells. Upon finding one, \" it latches and pulls it in, \" adding to the size of a tumor. \" no one had a clue that there were specialized cells in this process, \" soll says. \" the tumorigenic cells know what they're doing. They make tumors. \" but how do they know what to do? or as red orbit frames it, \" as evil as cancer seems to all of us, there must be a reason for the behavior that goes beyond malicious intent. \" observing the cancerous cells recruiting healthy ones offers a \" surprising clue \" into the how part of the question, notes medical news today. As for the why, soll's hypothesis is that the cells are harking back to when they were programmed to form embryos — they may be trying to create a \" self-sustaining \" environment in which a tumor can grow and thrive. \" you might want one big tumor capable of producing the tissue it needs to form a micro-environment, \" he says. \" it's as if it's building its own defenses against the body's efforts to defeat them. \" ( in troubling news, more young people are getting a particularly nasty form of cancer. )",

But longaberger died in 1999, the economy started faltering ( meaning basket-buying was no longer a priority ), and the company fell behind in taxes on the building: it currently owes more than a half-million dollars, the newark advocate reports.

Still, workers aren't too upset, as they ' ll now all be in frazeysburg. \" it will make it easier for all work groups to interact with each other and feel even more like a true family, \" a rep for longaberger's parent company tells the dispatch.

Carroll, a professor of pediatrics. No, sitting for hours a day is not great, and yes, prolonged sitting has been found to be linked to poor health outcomes. But the evidence doesn't support the idea that it's prolonged sitting at work that is the problem. In fact, there are studies that have found prolonged sitting at work does not have the same adverse effects as prolonged sitting in other situations, and there are also studies finding too much standing or walking at work is linked to health problems. The real problem with prolonged sitting is when it's part of an overall sedentary lifestyle. As carroll explains, it could very well be that prolonged sitting is a marker for other problems, such as unemployment, and it's those other problems that lead to a sedentary lifestyle. It's the type of prolonged sitting that's associated with an overall sedentary lifestyle that you want to avoid. The best way to combat it? exercise, and standing at a desk is not exercise. There's also no proof that standing to work improves cardiovascular health, vox reports. Rather than buying a standing desk and thinking you're getting the benefit of actual exercise, some experts suggest taking walking breaks throughout the day at work. There are, however, other benefits to sit-stand desks, including alleviating neck and back pain, and headlines like \" i tried using a standing desk at work for a week and it instantly gave me more energy \" still abound.
