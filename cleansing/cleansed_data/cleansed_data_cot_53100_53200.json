        "summary": "Got the blues? you probably aren't seeing blues clearly. That's the takeaway from a new study that finds how a person views the color blue may actually depend on mood, reports medical daily. Not all colors were affected in the same way. Researchers at the university of rochester asked 129 college students to watch either a stand-up comedy clip or the scene from the lion king in which mufasa dies, then recorded the participants ' moods, per the washington post. Next, participants took a color accuracy test in which they had to look at 48 color patches that had been desaturated to look nearly gray, then identify whether each was red, yellow, green, or blue. People who were feeling down in the dumps performed worse than those who were amused. In other words, the data supports \" the conventional wisdom that people's emotions influence how colorful the world looks to them, \" the researchers say. However, the sad group performed poorly only when quizzed about colors on what researchers call the blue-yellow axis. They could identify colors on the red-green axis just as well as others — perhaps due to the evolutionary need to see red as a sign of anger, reports time. The results are \" a reminder that our experience of the world is not as immediate and objective as we'd like to believe, \" observes the post. Researchers suggest a sad mood messes up the ability of the neuron transmitter dopamine to process information about blue-yellow colors. ( this woman sees 100 times more colors than you. )",

        "summary": "When officials decided to vent radioactive steam from one of the damaged nuclear power plants in japan, they knew it could result in a hydrogen explosion. And, even though an explosion is exactly what happened, the decision was still the best option for avoiding a total meltdown, the ap reports in an interesting piece that traces the chain of events from friday, when the earthquake damaged the fukushima dai-ichi nuclear complex, to this morning, when a total of six reactors were placed under a state of emergency. More from japan: the estimated death toll is more than 10,000 as of today, with the prime minister calling this disaster japan's worst crisis since world war ii, the ap reports. The confirmed dead number more than 1,800. Nuclear plant operators dumped sea water into two reactors in a last-ditch attempt to keep temperatures down, as officials warned a second explosion could occur, but would not pose a health threat. Experts confirm to reuters that \"this is not a serious public health issue at the moment, \" and that the winds will likely carry contamination to the pacific, where it will not threaten any other nations. The next crisis facing japan could be an economic one, reuters reports. Automakers, electronics firms, and oil refineries have been forced to suspend operations at some of their factories, and many companies are not sure how soon they will be back up and running. Even so, experts say the economy could bounce back in months. Click for more on japan.",

Besides a private shower, the new studio has another advantage. \"we have so much more space now that we're going to be able to have chuy enter on elephants and different kinds of animals, \" handler says of her oft-abused sidekick, chuy bravo. And what does bravo think about the set upgrade? \"chuy can't speak english, so i don't even know if he knows about the move, \" handler quips. The new set can accommodate 200 audience members, up from 75. But the show hopes to maintain an intimate vibe. Timothy white/e! \"conan has a great intimate audience and he is about 200, \" handler says. \"my whole shtick is my audience, so i actually really want them more involved in the show, as cheesy as that may sound",

But the body of a child, found near the south australia town of wynarka and thus far unidentified, has led the detectives investigating the disappearance of madeleine to reach out to their australian counterparts. Here's why: the remains, contained in a suitcase that also held a quilt and some clothing, are thought to be those of a fair-haired girl, between the ages of 2 and 4, who was killed some time after the beginning of 2007. Madeleine vanished at age 3 on may 3, 2007. Nbc news reports police said the child was likely white, with hair about 7 inches long. The australian associated press reported the skeletal remains were found on july 15; it's thought the suitcase had been left along the rural highway four to six weeks prior, with the child having been killed before that. British law enforcement officials confirm they have made contact, but neither side sounds overly optimistic. It's \" highly unlikely \" the remains are those of madeleine, says detective superintendent des bray, per the guardian. Adds the commissioner, to suggest the child is madeleine \" at this point in time would purely be speculating to get attention. \" what they are zeroing in on, per the advertiser: that homemade quilt. \" the quilt is really important to the investigation, \" says bray.

Forster gives this great description of how the water is stored, per the bbc: \" in the air space between the ice particles, like the juice in a snow cone. \" but the find has raised plenty of questions, like: how old is the water? does it stay where it is, or trickle to the sea... Or rush toward the sea in a flood? in a separate study, the team determined that if released, the aquifer's water could push global sea levels up 0.015 inches. And in terms of sea level rise, livescience explains that scientists have long assumed that most of the water produced in the country's annual surface melt streams toward the ocean, or eventually refroze; the aquifer is essentially a \" new hiding place, \" one that researchers can study to get a better grasp on the annual melt.

The miami herald reports emanuel zayas died friday night due to kidney and lung complications at the holtz children's hospital. Emanuel suffered from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, which usa today reports spurs the body to grow something akin to scar tissue instead of bone; his family initially thought the growth, which the washington post reports surfaced when he was 11, was a pimple. His parents sought help for years, but cuban doctors were too skittish over the risks of surgery. The family finally secured a humanitarian visa. It allowed him to fly to miami on nov. 27 and undergo surgery jan. 13 at the hands of dr. Robert marx, who heads up maxillofacial surgery at the university of miami health system and had once removed a woman's 16-pound facial tumor. Said marx in a statement: \" after visiting emanuel last night and observing a ray of hope from his pupillary reflexes and the muscle tone of his face, i was informed this morning that his condition had turned grave.... The physiological stress of the surgery was apparently too much for his compromised anatomy. Our hopes of saving his life, and with that allowing him a better quality of life, were not realized. \" marx says the teen's body will be donated to science by the family, in hopes of learning more about the condition.",

        "summary": "\" we will take revenge for each and every drop of our children's blood, \" pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif vowed as funerals began for 132 children slaughtered in a taliban attack on a school in peshawar yesterday. Sharif said there would be three days of national mourning for the massacre at a military-run school, in which 10 staff members were killed, as well as all seven attackers, the bbc reports. Sharif also said he would reinstate the death penalty for terrorism. More: the attack was condemned worldwide, with pakistan's archrival india, whose president called the attack \" a senseless act of unspeakable brutality, \" observing two minutes of silence in schools, reports the ap. Even the taliban in afghanistan spoke out against the atrocity, calling it \" un-islamic. \" there are signs that the attackers — some of whom reportedly spoke in arabic to each other — had intended to stay for a long siege, with some of them carrying stores of food, the new york times reports. A security official, however, says they never attempted to take any hostages. \" they were there to kill, and this is what they did, \" he says. One official tells the guardian that the attackers accessed the school via an unguarded back wall. They may have parked their vehicle next to it and then just climbed on the roof of the vehicle and over the wall. A pakistani taliban spokesman says the attack was revenge for a military offensive against the militants in areas including north waziristan, where he says hundreds of innocent people have been killed. The country's defense minister tells cnn that the country will not back off from the offensive, but that the slaughter is another example of the sacrifices pakistan has made in its battle against the militants. \" the smaller the coffin, the heavier it is to carry, \" he says. \" it's a very, very tragic day. \"",

Samuel najera, spokesman for the mexican episcopal conference, said its web page on the papal visit was blocked by \" a cyber attack. \" \" we have been aware of the threat that has been making the rounds on social networks, that was brought to fruition today, \" najera said. \" this is part of a dynamic these days of a lack of safety and acts of intolerance toward certain groups. \" \" for the moment, this does damage to the logistics \" of the papal visit, najera said. The site contained information on the pope's planned activities starting friday in the north-central state of guanajuato, which is governed by president felipe calderon's national action party, or pan. The anonymous iberoamerica website, which has been a channel of communication for such hacker \" ops \" in the past, said the site crashes were the result of anonymous operations with names such \" pharisee \" and \" freeloader. \" anonymous mexico said in a video posted on social media sites that the pope's visit will cost mexicans money that could be better spent on the poor,",

In their findings published in the bmj open journal, researchers from university college london studied 3,432 adults ages 18 to 40 who'd been bereaved by a sudden death of a friend or family member. They found that individuals whose deceased loved ones had killed themselves were 65 % more likely to attempt suicide themselves ( what ndtv refers to as the phenomenon of \" suicide contagion \" ) than those affected by a loved one's sudden death by natural causes — or 1 in 10 people in that segment, per a press release. And having someone close to you die by suicide was found to have other repercussions, too: the study discovered that those affected by suicidal deaths were 80 % more likely to leave a work or educational situation, per the release. \" our results highlight the profound impact that suicide might have on friends and family members, \" study author dr. Alexandra pitman says in the release. And the social stigma around suicide may be a significant factor affecting a mourning person's outlook. \" suicide in particular is often perceived as a taboo subject, \" pitman notes. \" avoiding the subject can make a bereaved person feel very isolated and stigmatized, and sometimes even blamed for the death. \" that's not to say, though, that having such a tragedy afflict a family member or close friend dooms a person to a similar sad fate. \" these outcomes are by no means inevitable, \" pitman says. \" if you have been bereaved by suicide, you should know that are not alone and support is available. \" ( a marine unit has lost 14 members to suicide. )",

        "summary": "The cause of jane austen's death at age 41 in 1817 has been an enduring mystery of the literary world. The legendary author's own letters complain of ill health, and experts have used them to suggest a number of possible culprits, from stomach cancer to hodgkin's lymphoma, the washington post reports. Now, a trio of eyeglasses found in austen's desk could hold a more intriguing answer. The spectacles of increasing strength indicate austen suffered from progressive eye problems; indeed, the pride and prejudice author notes her \" weak \" eyes in her missives. Austen may have suffered from an underlying health problem that attacked her vision, writes british library curator sandra tuppen, who theorizes slow-growing cataracts might have been caused by accidental arsenic poisoning. The toxic metal was common in 19th-century england, tainting medicine, water, and even wallpaper. Other causes such as diabetes would have killed austen more quickly, says tuppen. The debate over austen's death dates back to 1964, when an english doctor argued the culprit was the adrenal disorder addison's disease. Then crime writer lindsay ashford floated the arsenic theory in a 2011 novel, citing the skin discoloration that austin notes late in her life. \" i think it's highly likely she was given a medicine containing arsenic, \" says ashford. \" when you look at her list of symptoms and compare them to the list of arsenic symptoms, there is an amazing correlation. \" but austen scholar janine barchas, who has her own forthcoming report on the glasses, calls the arsenic theory \" reckless, \" per the new york times. \" we look forward to further discussions and debate on this topic, \" writes tuppen.

            "The medical report said mr mckinnon, who is known to suffer asperger's syndrome, a form of autism, also has a \"fixed-psychological conviction he will kill himself in preference to being extradited \". The emergency study by consultant psychiatrist professor jeremy turk of st george's hospital, london, said that suicide was now an \"almost certain inevitability \". Details of the report emerged following a decision by alan johnson, the home secretary, not to block the extradition on medical grounds, as disclosed by the daily telegraph on thursday. Mr mckinnon's distraught mother said the government, and mr johnson, \" should hang their heads in shame \" over the extradition to face hacking charges. Extracts of prof turk's report, disclosed in the daily mail, show that he recorded in september that mr mckinnon, 43, suffered from a \"'very serious major depressive disorder....

            "Dubai iran will increase its naval presence in the gulf to strengthen its authority over three islands which the united arab emirates says are its territory, tehran said on sunday. The islands sit near oil shipping routes at the mouth of the strategic strait of hormuz and the challenge over their sovereignty is a constant threat to iran's fragile relations with its arab neighbors. \" the security of the iranian islands in the persian gulf is part of the various strategies of the naval force of the islamic revolutionary guard corps, \" irgc commander mohammad ali jafari said, according to the website of state television irib. Jafari was speaking at a ceremony inaugurating a fifth \" naval defense zone \" at the port of bandar lengeh. He said the irgc was \" increasing, expanding and improving the expert capability in naval defense \" in the five zones. \" the fifth zone of the guards ' naval force is one of the naval defense chains which is in particular responsible for the defense of the iranian islands in the persian gulf, \" he said. The 41-year-old dispute between shi ' ite muslim iran and the sunni uae over the islands - greater and lesser tunb and abu musa - has nationalist and ethnic overtones and was inflamed when president mahmoud ahmadinejad visited abu musa in april. In september, uae foreign minister sheikh abdullah bin zayed al-nahayan said iran's \" occupation \" of the three islands was against international law. Last month iran's foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast said tehran would consider downgrading ties with the uae over the dispute, although the foreign ministry later denied the report, according to state television.

Mike mccaul, chairman of the house homeland security committee, says the device detonated at the end of an ariana grande concert shows a \" level of sophistication \" that suggests the involvement of foreign terror cells, the ap reports. \" it looks like we're not dealing with a lone wolf situation. There's a network — a cell of isis-inspired terrorists, \" the republican says. Sky news reports that german intelligence services say abedi was in the country around four days before the manchester attack. Security camera footage obtained by sky shows a man suspected to be abedi in manchester's arndale shopping center on friday with what may be the backpack used in the bombing. One of the latest of the 22 victims to be identified is 14-year-old eilidh macleod, who had traveled from the scottish island of barra to manchester with her mother and a friend for the concert, the telegraph reports. \" eilidh was vivacious and full of fun. She loved all music, whether it was listening to ariana or playing the bagpipes with her pipe band, \" her family said in a statement.",

She told abc that she has \" accepted responsibility \" for her actions. \" no one told me to do this. No one directed me to do this. This is me. It's on me, \" she said. Manning was released from a military prison in fort leavenworth, kansas, on may 18 after serving seven years of a 35-year sentence, which was commuted by former president barack obama in his final days in office. Obama said in january he felt justice had been served. She hasn't spoken to obama since her release, but emotionally thanked him in the interview for giving her \" another chance. \" manning also touched on her struggles dealing with her gender transition while in prison. She says she tried to kill herself twice behind bars and fought for the hormone treatments she says keep her alive. Manning remains in the army, but is off duty while she appeals her court-martial conviction. \" i have nothing but utmost respect for the military, \" she said in the interview, per abc.",

What gawker says is perceived as the \" utopian idea \" of an unconditional basic income has been bandied about by individual cities in countries such as the netherlands and canada, but switzerland would be the first nation to go for it. A group of swiss intelligentsia was able to cull the 100,000 signatures required under the swiss system to get it on the ballot. \" it would lead to a more motivated workforce and [ a ] more humanized, stable, and productive economy, \" the initiative's co-founder says. The estimated $ 200 billion-a-year plan would be funded in part by raising the country's value-added tax ( currently at 8 % ), its supporters say. Critics, however, say other taxes would have to rise, too, and fear the plan would sap people's motivation to work. Someone with no income would reap the full $ 2,600 a month tax-free, while others making some money would have their income supplemented to reach that cap ( so if you already make $ 1,000, the government would fork over $ 1,600 ). And if you already bring in more than that $ 2,600 limit? that amount of your monthly income wouldn't be taxed. Usa today spells out what that would mean for two parents who didn't work with two kids at home: a combined family income, tax-free, of $ 78,000 a year. It doesn't appear likely the vote will go the initiative's way.",

        "summary": "Here's an unfortunate hypothetical: an earthquake strikes along the san andreas fault, damaging three aqueducts that cross it some 32 times. Those aqueducts supply los angeles with all but 12 % of its water — meaning a serious quake could ultimately leave 22 million people without water. ( there would be about six month's worth of water stored on the la side of the fault, but fixing busted aqueducts could take more than twice that long. ) officials have been aware of the potential for a single quake to hit all three aqueducts since 2008, but as the los angeles times reports, they're now moving to do something about it for the first time. But any solution is pretty far off, in terms of time and money — in terms of the latter, the lat uses the word \" billions. \" none of the aqueducts has yet had to deal with the scenario; the last huge quake ( magnitude 7.9 ) along the fault was in 1857. The los angeles aqueduct travels across the fault under a mountain, by way of the five-mile-long concrete elizabeth tunnel. Building a brand new tunnel is the priciest option; sending water over the mountains via an electric pumping mechanism is another idea. In the case of the colorado river aqueduct, a quake could raise a section of the pipe by 13 feet, and there aren't any pumps in place to ferry the water to la. The mayor last week requested that proposals on the issue be submitted by july. Meanwhile, the san diego union-tribune reports that there may be another fault to fear: it points to new research that shows the san jacinto fault could generate an earthquake as powerful as what the san andreas fault is capable of.",

Rockwell oversaw field studies that examined 21 seismic events that have occurred on the fault over the past 4,000 years. The study, recently published in the journal pure and applied geophysics, was centered at hog lake, a spot near anza. The san jacinto is part of the larger san andreas fault, the dividing line between the pacific and north american plates. Scientists say that the two faults are responsible for roughly 80 percent of the slippage along the plates.

A day after she was reported missing, her naked body was found in a river; she had been raped and strangled to death. That was nearly 30 years ago. This week a french serial killer known as the ogre of the ardennes is said to have confessed to the crime, according to afp. Didier seban, a lawyer for parrish's family, tells the bbc that 75-year-old michel fourniret confessed to the 1990 murder of parrish — as well as the 1988 murder of marie-angele domece, whose body was never found — to judges \" two to three times \" over the past week. The press association reports parrish's family was shocked by the confession. Fourniret was given life in prison in 2008 after being found guilty of raping and killing seven women between the ages of 12 and 21. His wife, monique olivier, was also given life in prison for picking up a number of his victims while driving around with their baby. Fourniret was charged with the murders of parrish and domece in 2008 after olivier said he was responsible for them, only to have the cases dismissed in 2011 after olivier recanted. A court of appeal later cancelled that dismissal and ordered investigations into new leads.

        "summary": "A horrifying incident is becoming somewhat of a trend in india, where a third teenager has reportedly been raped and then burned alive, with all the incidents happening in the span of one week. The bbc reports the 16-year-old was allegedly killed after informing her attacker, a man police have named as 28-year-old ravi chadhar, she wouldn't stay mum about the rape. She was reportedly doused with fuel and set on fire in her madhya pradesh home. Cnn reports that the girl's cousin allegedly told her attacker she was home alone; both the cousin and chadhar have been arrested. The other attacks occurred in jharkhand, with one of the girls, 17, surviving in critical condition with burns to 70 % of her body. Her attacker allegedly had wanted to marry her but had been denied. The first case involved a 16-year-old who was killed after her parents reported her rape to village leaders. Enraged by the punishment the elders imposed — 100 sit-ups and a fine of roughly $ 750 — police say dhanu singh bhuiyan stormed into the girl's house in the village of chatra, attacked her parents, and fatally set the girl on fire.",

Scientists using the herschel telescope found that unlike other comets studied, the comet hartley 2 contains water with the same chemical signature as water on our planet, suggesting that cometary impacts brought the water that covered the rocky and dry early earth, the bbc reports. Hartley 2 is believed to have formed in the kuiper belt, not far outside the solar system. Comets studied earlier came from the much more distant oort cloud and had a different chemical composition, leading scientists to believe only 10 % of earth's water could have come from comets. \" it was a big surprise when we saw the ratio was almost the same as what we find in the earth's oceans, \" the lead researcher tells reuters. \" it means it is not true any more that a maximum of 10 % of water could have come from comets.

London ( reuters ) - astronomers have found the first comet with ocean-like water in a major boost to the theory that the celestial bodies were a significant source of water for a thirsty early earth. The intense heat of the planet immediately after it formed means any initial water would have quickly evaporated and scientists believe the oceans emerged around 8 million years later. The puzzle is where the water, which is vital for life on earth, came from. Past analysis of water-ice from far-flung comets suggested they could have delivered no more than 10 percent of today's oceans because the chemical \" fingerprints \" did not match up. But research from paul hartogh of germany's max planck institute for solar system research and colleagues published on wednesday showed a comet called 103p/hartley 2 has the same chemical composition as the earth's oceans. The finding substantially increases the amount of water that could have originated from comets, which are made up of rock and ice with a characteristic tail of gas and dust.

Like our oceans, it had half the amount of deuterium seen from other comets. The result, published in nature, hints at the idea that much of the earth's water could have initially come from cometary impacts. Just a few million years after its formation, the early earth was rocky and dry; most likely, something brought the water that covers most of the planet today. Water has something of a molecular fingerprint in the amount of deuterium it contains, and only about half a dozen comets have been measured in this way - and all of them have exhibited a deuterium fraction twice as high as the oceans. Asteroids, by contrast, give rise to the meteors and meteorites that arrive on earth, making their deuterium fraction more well-established. Meteoritic material has roughly the same proportion of deuterium that the earth's oceans contain, and so the assumption has been that if water arrived from elsewhere, it came from asteroids.

All the time, he was lying dead 1,500 feet away, a third victim of what police describe as a fake robbery turned real. According to an arrest affidavit released tuesday, lindquist had offered his father's guns to a man in exchange for drugs, so long as the man staged the scene to look like a burglary. That's not what happened. Now charged in the case, 23-year-old ruth correa reportedly told police her brother, sergio correa, hit lindquist in the head with a machete after lindquist panicked, per the washington post. The siblings then stabbed lindquist, leaving his body in the woods near his parents ' home, which they entered through a basement door they knew to be unlocked, per the affidavit. When kenneth and janet lindquist appeared, 26-year-old sergio hit kenneth, 56, with a baseball bat while ruth told janet that \" her son had set her up, \" the affidavit states, per nbc connecticut. The document says sergio then choked janet, 61, and hit her in the head with the bat before he and his sister set the house alight and took off with stolen goods and matthew lindquist's car, later found burned. After reportedly telling police that her brother might be planning to kill her, ruth correa was arrested on charges of murder, home invasion, arson, and robbery on may 12, a week after matthew lindquist's body was found. At the time, police said additional arrests were expected. Sergio correa has yet to be charged, though.

        "summary": "A connecticut couple in their mid-50s has been missing for two weeks now, and police are investigating whether their financial troubles — including $ 2.2 million in debt — may have something to do with it, reports cnn. Their families, however, aren't buying it. Police found the pickup belonging to jeffrey and jeanette navin in a commuter parking lot by the exit of a local expressway on aug. 9 but say there's no sign of foul play. The easton police chief says it's possible the navins are on vacation somewhere safe and sound, but acknowledges that suspicion is mounting the longer they remain out of touch. Money problems had been piling up for the navins, last seen aug. 4 at a garbage company they own. Jeffrey took out a $ 1.3 million mortgage on a six-bedroom-five-bathroom house in 2005 and stopped paying it in 2007. He lost his third appeal over the $ 2.2 million he owes in the foreclosure case in july. He also racked up six-figure debt to the power company. The hartford courant reports the couple sold another of their homes for $ 900,000 in june and moved to a rental house. Family members object to the focus on finances and point out that the couple, who earned up to $ 216,000 a year, haven't touched their bank accounts in this \" overwhelming and troubling time, \" the daily news reports. Jeffrey's attorney can't shed any light: \" i ' m in the dark just like everybody else is, \" he tells the courant. \" i just hope that they're all right. \" ( in florida, a female firefighter who has been missing for 9 years was just declared dead. )",

        "summary": "When harvard suspended its men's soccer team last week for the rest of the season due to an \" appalling \" system of ranking female players, one of the reasons the school gave for its harsh punishment was the fact that team members weren't exactly communicative and cooperative at first ( the team as a whole has since apologized ). Per inside higher ed, the men on the school's cross-country team were obviously paying attention to the smackdown: now members of that roster have come forward to admit to their own past spreadsheets ( some containing \" sexually explicit \" remarks ) describing female athletes and compiled each year before a dance held with the women's cross-country team, the harvard crimson reports. The cross-country team's documents included speculation as to which guys would get an invite to the dance from which girls, with some comments referring to the women's weight or other physical attributes. And per correspondence between alumni seen by the crimson, even former and current team members acknowledge how bad past spreadsheets were, with one noting, \" hahaha dude 2012 was the absolute worst. \" team captain brandon e. Price, who on saturday emailed the team to \" come clean \" about any female rankings, says the team has tamped down the lewdness since a 2014 spreadsheet the team was \" particularly ashamed of. \" the school's athletic director says in a statement: \" harvard athletics does not tolerate this sort of demeaning and derogatory behavior, and we will address any credible information we receive. \" ( a response from some of the former female soccer players. )",

        "summary": "Kisspeptin, a naturally occurring hormone that kicks off puberty and is thought to fuel what the telegraph describes as the \" voracious sexual appetites of young people, \" could well be a sort of \" mental viagra \" for people with psychosexual disorders — that is, disorders that are psychological as opposed to physical. And because these disorders can occur in patients who are infertile, researchers from imperial college london report in the journal of clinical investigation that kisspeptin could even play a role in helping couples struggling to conceive. The early-stage study began to lay the groundwork for that theory by testing how kisspeptin affects the brain's responses to sexual situations. To achieve this, researchers injected kisspeptin or a placebo into 29 healthy young men, explains a press release. When shown arousing images, mri scans of the kisspeptin group revealed enhanced activity in brain regions associated with arousal compared to the placebo group. There was no such activity observed when non-sexual romantic images were shown. The lead author notes that most research and treatments for infertility focus on important biological factors, but that emotional processing is also key and \" only partially understood. \" next up, they plan to expand the study's size and include women. Bonus trivia: kisspeptin's name comes from hershey, pa., which is home to both hershey's kisses and the lab that in 1996 discovered the kiss-1 gene that encodes kisspeptins, reports the new statesman.

Reports say kim jong-un reached the 2,750-metre peak alongside hundreds of fighter pilots and party officials. \" climbing mount paektu provides precious mental pabulum more powerful than any kind of nuclear weapon, \" the rodong newspaper quoted him as saying to troops. The purpose of the visit is said to have been to see pilots from the korean people's army who have completed a tour of battle sites in the area. The oxford english dictionary defines \" pabulum \" as \" bland or insipid intellectual matter, entertainment \". The peak of the volcanic mountain, lying on the border with china, is considered a sacred place in korean folklore. It is also part of the propaganda which glorifies the kim family, who are said to have a \" mount paektu bloodline \". Recently it has been claimed that mr kim could drive by the time he was three years old. The regime also says that kim jong-il, who ruled until his death in 2011, scored 11 holes-in-one the first"

The procedure could lead to a new way to treat heart attacks and at least partially repair heart damage, the guardian reports. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the us. Scientists are intrigued by the idea of treating damaged hearts by using a patient's own skin cells to create healthy heart cells, which are less likely to be rejected since they don't come from a donor. In the latest study in the journal nature, the team at shinshu university induced heart attacks in five macaques and then injected them with heart cells made from the skin of a healthy macaque who was a close genetic match. To avoid rejection, they ensured the donor monkey had a type of protein similar to the recipients ' and they gave the sick monkeys anti-rejection drugs. After studying the macaques for three months, researchers found their immune systems tolerated the new cells, which replaced about 16 % of the damaged heart tissue. In the end, the monkeys ' heart muscles contracted better, pumping blood more efficiently. Human trials are not coming anytime soon, though, after the macaques developed irregular heartbeats. Still, doctors said the findings raise the possibility of treating damage caused by heart attacks. \" currently, the only long term option for these patients is heart transplantation, but there are not enough donors to meet the current demand, \" heart researcher sam boateng told the guardian.

The latest: the ap reports the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder are already being examined in an attempt to get at the cause of the crash, which was originally attributed to an electrical failure. But a flight attendant who survived reported the plane ran out of fuel just before it was to land at jose maria cordova airport outside medellin. The british aerospace 146 avro short-haul jet had a maximum range of around 1,600 nautical miles — about the distance between santa cruz, where the plane departed from, and medellin. An aviation expert tells the ap that air distance between cities is usually measured by the shortest route but planes rarely fly in a straight line, with pilots steering around turbulence, for example. There was also heavy rain when the crew declared an emergency monday night. Abc news reports it may have been a \" nightmare scenario \": flight data indicates the plane circled three times just outside medellin. The airport it was headed to is an infamously challenging one, located in a mountainous region at 7,000 feet, an elevation that necessitates a high-speed approach. Three players from the chapecoense team survived the crash but sustained serious injuries, reports reuters: goalkeeper jackson follmann has had his right leg amputated; defender helio neto suffered severe trauma to the skull, thorax, and lungs; and alan ruschel underwent spine surgery. A heart-wrenching final statement, per the ap: moments before the plane took off, the team's coaching staff gave an interview to a bolivian television station in which they praised the airline, saying it brought them good fortune when it flew them to colombia last month for the championship's quarterfinals, which they won. \" now we're going to do this new trip and we hope they bring us good luck like they did the first time, \" athletic director mauro stumpf told gigavision tv.",

        "summary": "Consider these two numbers: 5.57 inches and 6.69. The first is the average erect penile length, according to a study of 1,661 american men. The latter is the minimum length that standard condoms have been required to be. If that seems like a disconnect, well, it is, and change is coming — though not without some difficulty. In a look at the condom industry, the new york times explains that revolution is challenging in large part because of the food and drug administration. It classifies condoms as medical devices, which means any new product has to go through pricey clinical trials to gain approval. Case in point: the gates foundation gave mark mcglothlin $ 100,000 to pursue his idea of making condoms from things like cow tendon, but he's far short of the $ 2 million he says the trials would cost. And the makeup of the tests themselves have been problematic. One is called the \" hang-and-squeeze, \" and it's much like it sounds like: a condom is filled with water and then squeezed to look for leakage. But make a condom for the 5.57-inch — or less — man, and filling it with the required water volume doesn't work. The fda and two standards organizations have started to acknowledge the limitations and tweak the requirements and tests, and that's opened the door for boston-based global protection corp. To begin selling condoms that come in 60 sizes. Per a press release, 28 of those sizes are larger than the length, width, or both of the \" leading xl condom, \" while 27 are smaller than the typical one.

It's called the \" dangerous lagoon, \" and a spokesperson for toronto police service tells the cbc the man's stunt was, in fact, \" extremely dangerous \" to him, the marine animals in the tank, and the staff that tried to get him out of the water. The aquarium was open late at the time for its friday night jazz program. Security personnel asked the swimmer to exit the water but he instead swam to the edge, got out, then did a backward flip right back in. \" the guy seemed totally relaxed and there were sharks like everywhere, \" the aforementioned witness notes. Eventually, the man did get out, put his clothes back on, and slipped into a crowd of onlookers. Security had called police, but the man was gone by the time they arrived; they are currently investigating the incident. They want to speak to the man, and the police rep says he could face charges including trespassing, mischief, and indecent exposure. The aquarium says it will press charges if the man is found, the toronto star reports. ( this shark likes the taste of plants more than meat. )",

The name of the victim, a woman in her 80s, was not released. Wilson did not know how many people were evacuated, but there were no reports of injuries tuesday evening. Police closed durant avenue between telegraph and shattuck avenues for several hours while crews investigated.

Her body was recovered monday morning under 3 feet of snow, per the post independent. The couple had moved to bozeman so perkins could pursue a degree in math and education at montana state university. Kennedy, hailed in 2014 as maybe \" the best young climber on the planet, \" was studying for an emt certification. He wrote recently of the pain of seeing \" too many friends go to the mountains only to never return … climbing is either a beautiful gift or a curse. \" as tributes flowed to the pair, kennedy's family says they \" sorrowfully \" respect his final decision and remembered \" an uncensored soul whose accomplishments as a mountaineer were always secondary to his deep friendships and mindfulness. \" ( another climber survived one avalanche on everest, but perished on his second ascent. )",

The wall looked absolutely huge from our belay stance a few hundred feet off the ground. Hayden stepped off the anchor and headed into one of the first few cruxes — near vertical face climbing with minuscule handholds and little crystals for footholds. He moved quickly, confidently, and when he got into big-fall territory on hard climbing he simply \"journeyed on, \" as he said. It didn't take long to see that hayden, on his first el cap route, was the future of climbing. Here was a kid ticking off 5.14s at rifle every few weeks, with a solid lead head, and miles and miles of hard and varied climbing under his belt. I was impressed. Then hayden and i drove out to yosemite that may, he pointed out towers that he'd climbed long before he \"officially became a climber, \" when he began taking the sport seriously at age 13 or 14. \"i grew",

Now it's the police who find themselves in the crosshairs, the new york times reports. In 2014 and 2015, stephen port used dating apps to lure his victims to his apartment, where he drugged, raped, and killed them. According to the guardian, port \" had a fetish for sex with unconscious boyish-looking men. \" despite the bodies of all four victims turning up near port's apartment — including three in the same churchyard — in a 15-month span and dying from the same drug, police chalked the deaths up to unconnected suicides and overdoses. Police only started looking into the possibility of connected murders after pressure from one of the victim's families. Police have now admitted they maybe could have caught port sooner, and 17 officers are being investigated. Port left the first body outside his apartment building and called police. Despite changing his story and admitting the victim was in his apartment and he dragged the body outside, police didn't view him as a suspect, cnn reports. Port left a fake suicide note on one of the bodies that read \" btw, please do not blame the guy i was with last night. \" police didn't bother trying to find the \" guy. \" and there was more. The family of one of port's victims is suing the police, accusing them of not looking into the deaths too hard because the victims were all gay. A formal investigation is attempting to determine if \" discrimination played any part \" in what happened. ( he was an nfl draft pick — and a brazen serial killer. )",

            "Conventional wisdom in the northern hemisphere is to face solar panels south so they get the most light all day. Architects and panel installers implement this approach all the time, especially on homes. But a new study indicates that panels facing west may actually get more juice from the sun, and at more convenient times. Researchers at the pecan street research institute did a study of homes with solar panels in austin, texas and found that when homeowners faced solar panels west they were able to generate 2 % more electricity in a day. And they also generated more electricity in the afternoon, when power grids experience peak demand. Advertisement though a 2 % increase in electricity generation isn't enormous, it would certainly add up over the life of solar panels. And the rise in afternoon performance, reducing grid dependance during peak hours by 65 % as opposed to 54 % for"

The jaguar was captured and returned to its night house after being sedated by a vet team. No people were hurt and the zoo was reopened sunday.

It's not immediately clear how the animal escaped. Zoo officials say inspections found that the roof was \" compromised, \" but initial findings concluded that keeper error was not a factor."

Some 78 of the jets in question belong to southwest airlines — which has carried out its own inspections — and two are being used by alaska airlines. Inspectors must use an electro-magnetic process that detects cracks invisible to the naked eye. Neither the federal aviation administration nor boeing currently requires checks to be carried out on the section of aircraft that cracked open.

            "The government plans to order emergency inspections today of 80 older boeing 737s similar to the southwest airlines jet that suffered a 5-foot tear in its roof on friday in a search for possibly dangerous cracks. The federal aviation administration order will cover some 737-300s, 737-400s and 737-500s, models of the popular jet built in the 1980s and 1990s. The jets covered under the order include those built with a specific manufacturing process and with more than 30,000 flights, the agency said monday. There are about 175 of the aircraft worldwide, 80 of which are registered in the usa, the faa said. Southwest operates 78 of the jets and alaska airlines has two. Boeing said it is also working on a bulletin to airlines suggesting inspections. Although the number of jets affected by the order is small, some aviation safety experts said the incident is shining a new light onto aging aircraft safety. Despite more than two decades of efforts to better understand and detect cracks, the tear on the southwest jet occurred in an area that was not considered high risk. \" this could change the conversation regarding the risk of aging aircraft, \" said bill voss, president of the flight safety foundation. The faa last year toughened the standards for aging aircraft, but the latest discovery could lead to even broader requirements for costly inspections, voss said.",

Inspections will initially focus on 175 planes, used by airlines around the world, that make frequent takeoffs and landings. Eighty of the planes are in service in the united states, most of them for southwest airlines. The government is particularly concerned about older 737-300, 737-400 and 737-500 jets that have taken off and landed more than 30,000 times. Jets that have accumulated many flight cycles are apparently more likely to develop the sort of fatigue cracks that may have caused the tear in the skin of the southwest 737-300 last week. As the nation's planes age, more jets could cause concern and require inspection for such fatigue cracks. Inspectors use something called eddy current technology, passing an electric current through an aircraft's skin to look for small cracks. If any warning signs are detected, more sophisticated ultrasound and x-ray tools are then used for a closer examination. In some areas, a plane's skin can be as thin as a nickel. Fatigue cracks found in three other southwest jets southwest said today that it has inspected some 90 percent of its 737-300s, which were removed from service after"

            "The government plans to order emergency inspections today of 80 older boeing 737s similar to the southwest airlines jet that suffered a 5-foot tear in its roof on friday in a search for possibly dangerous cracks. The federal aviation administration order will cover some 737-300s, 737-400s and 737-500s, models of the popular jet built in the 1980s and 1990s. The jets covered under the order include those built with a specific manufacturing process and with more than 30,000 flights, the agency said monday. There are about 175 of the aircraft worldwide, 80 of which are registered in the usa, the faa said. Southwest operates 78 of the jets and alaska airlines has two. Boeing said it is also working on a bulletin to airlines suggesting inspections. Although the number of jets affected by the order is small, some aviation safety experts said the incident is shining a new light onto aging aircraft safety. Despite more than two decades of efforts to better understand and detect cracks, the tear on the southwest jet occurred in an area that was not considered high risk. \" this could change the conversation regarding the risk of aging aircraft, \" said bill voss, president of the flight safety foundation. The faa last year toughened the standards for aging aircraft, but the latest discovery could lead to even broader requirements for costly inspections, voss said.",
