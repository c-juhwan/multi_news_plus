        "summary": "Jpmorgan chase chief jamie dimon says he has been diagnosed with throat cancer — but it was caught early and he will be able to keep working while he is being treated. The 58-year-old ceo has told colleagues and shareholders that he will limit his travel during the eight weeks he is receiving radiation and chemotherapy treatment, but business will continue as usual, reports the wall street journal. Dimon says his prognosis is \" excellent \" and the cancer is confined to his throat and the lymph nodes on the right side of his neck. \" i feel very good now and will let all of you know if my health situation changes, \" wrote dimon, who has just marked his 10-year anniversary with the bank. Several top executives have recently left jpmorgan and it's not clear who would take charge if dimon was forced to step down, but the bank says plans were in place even before the ceo's diagnosis, the new york times reports. The bank \" had already established a short-term, medium-term, and longer-term succession plan, \" a spokesman says.",

            "Photo jamie dimon, the chief executive of jpmorgan chase, has throat cancer and will begin treatment shortly at memorial sloan kettering cancer center, he said in a note to the bank's employees and shareholders late tuesday. Doctors discovered the cancer at an early stage, mr. Dimon, 58, said, noting that his condition was \"curable. \" after a series of tests, he said the doctors confirmed that the cancer had not spread beyond the \"original site \" and the adjacent lymph nodes on the right side of his neck. Mr. Dimon assured employees at jpmorgan, the nation's largest bank, that the prognosis from the doctors was \"excellent. \" mr. Dimon, who has held the dual roles of chief executive and chairman at the bank since 2006, has been atop jpmorgan longer than any other bank chief. The announcement of his diagnosis came on mr. Dimon's 10-year anniversary at jpmorgan. That tenure, which began when jpmorgan acquired bank one, has been marked by triumph — the bank emerged from the financial crisis in better shape than its rivals — and by tumult. The bank has worked to mend its frayed relationships with regulators — a painful reconciliation that cost it roughly $ 20 billion. In november, jpmorgan reached a record $ 13 billion settlement with a range of government authorities over its sale of questionable mortgage-backed securities in the lead-up to the financial crisis. The bank also reached a $ 2 billion settlement over accusations that it failed to sound alarms about bernard l. Madoff's ponzi scheme. Jpmorgan has also been buffeted by the departure of several top executives. In the last two years alone, at least 10 senior executives have left jpmorgan. Most recently, michael j. Cavanagh, once considered an heir to mr. Dimon, left the bank to join the carlyle group, a private equity firm. And like its rivals, jpmorgan, which will report second-quarter earnings on july 15, is grappling with a slowdown in its trading business. It has been a particularly grueling stretch for trading units across wall street. The sluggish trading revenue traces, in part, to a spate of rules passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

This has devastated all the neighbors. \" as the police implore the public to come forward with any information that could help crack the case, they're releasing more details. The suspect is believed to have left the area in a dark-colored suv, which police think contained multiple stolen tvs, wrtv reports. A memorial for the slain 28-year-old, who was 12 weeks pregnant, was held sunday night at a nearby church, and more than 2,000 showed up to pay their respects, the star reports. Davey blackburn, meanwhile, said he was \" baffled \" by his wife's murder — \" amanda didn't have an enemy in the world \" — and that the worst part for him is knowing their 15-month-old son, weston, will grow up without his mother. \" she was the perfect mom, \" he said, per fox59. \" i wish every mom in the world could've learned from her. \"",

A total of between 20 to 25 bodies on 11 vessels ( the latest boat reportedly had anywhere from three to seven bodies inside, based on conflicting media reports ) have been retrieved so far in the sea of japan along shoreline that stretches over five prefectures, from hokkaido in the north to fukui in the southwest. That body of water separates the island nation from russia and the koreas — and authorities suspect that the boats came from north korea, based on scraps of cloth that featured the korean alphabet, nbc notes. The boats have, for the most part, been pulled to japan's shores, but the bodies still need to be ided, per the bbc. Per the independent, the latest boat towed into a fukui port was spotted about 62 miles out to sea and contained remains that \" were badly decomposed and partially skeletonized, \" tokyo broadcasting system reports. The paper also notes that japan's public broadcaster, nhk, reports a cloth fragment believed to be part of the north korean flag was found inside one of the boats; meanwhile, writing on the outside of one of the vessels is believed to say \" korean people's army. \" so how and why did the boats end up adrift and their occupants dead? some experts say refugees may have tried to escape their homeland, while others say fishermen could have simply been carried too far from land in their non-gps boats and been lost at sea for months, per the independent. At least 175 boats have drifted from the korean peninsula to japan since 2013, and some of those who've been rescued have told the japanese coast guard they're north korean fishermen, the tokyo reporter notes.

Yum! posted earnings per share of $ 0.87, narrowly lower than the $ 0.88 consensus, and revenue of $ 3.35 billion, also below the $ 3.45 billion estimate. The main problem was in china, where overall system sales fell 9 %, and same store sales sank 14 % in the wake of a july food safety scandal. Workers at kfc and mcdonald's meat supplier shanghai husi food co were shown in a tv report reusing meat that had fallen to the factory floor, as well as mixing fresh and expired meat. As chinese regulators shut the doors at husi, both american chains apologized and quickly announced that they had switched meat suppliers. But the episode has driven chinese consumers away from kfc restaurants, just as another scandal did in 2012. Yum! is especially reliant on kfc's huge presence there, as china accounts for more than half of the company's worldwide sales. Yum! said the scandal \" significantly impacted china sales \" and led to the company to reduce its full year earnings per share growth projection from 20",

            "Democrat stacey abrams entered the campaign for georgia governor on saturday with a pledge to expand pre-kindergarten programs and make technical college education free, promising she'd bring a \"bold and ambitious approach \" to state government that will invigorate the economy. Abrams, who heads her party's caucus in the georgia house, said that as governor she ' ll embrace the same knack for compromise with republicans who have controlled the statehouse for more than a decade when she sees common ground. But she said she would stick to a fiercely progressive agenda on some of the biggest partisan divides, including efforts to restrict abortion or pass \"religious liberty \" legislation she views as discriminatory. To emphasize that point, her announcement coincided with formal endorsements from emily's list, the influential left-leaning group, and democracy for america, a progressive pac with about 1 million supporters across the nation. \"georgia is ready for a democratic governor. My success demonstrates that difference doesn't have to be a barrier, \" abrams told the atlanta journal-constitution. \"southern politicians have to reject a notion that difference is a barrier and that we can't all be committed to progress and equality. \" abrams faces a fellow state legislator, stacey evans, in the democratic primary of the wide-open race to succeed gov. Nathan deal. Four republicans are already running:",

His home-state arizona republic, for instance, editorialized that it was of \" such striding ambition it sought to change the course of our national politics. \" among other things, mccain implored his fellow senators to work together across party lines, ignore \" bombastic loudmouths, \" and \" return to regular order. \" it was heady stuff, but at the new yorker, john cassidy sees a fundamental contradiction within it. For starters, he wonders, why on earth did mccain return to deliver it? by doing so, he allowed mitch mcconnell to proceed with a bill that has been jammed through with no hint of the \" regular order \" mccain talks about. It had no hearings and zero input from democrats. And now the end game appears to be get something, anything, passed so that republicans from the house and senate can then get together in secrecy to fashion a final version.

            "( reuters ) - former subway pitchman jared fogle is seeking release from a colorado federal prison, saying his guilty plea in a child pornography case was based on an illegal conspiracy charge and should be thrown out. Jared fogle is led from federal court in indianapolis, indiana august 19, 2015. Reuters/susan guyett/file photo fogle, 40, this week sought a writ of habeas corpus from the federal court in denver. He is serving a 15-year, eight-month sentence in nearby littleton, following a 2015 guilty plea to distributing child pornography and traveling for paid sex with girls. Fogle said his plea was unlawful because it included a \"charge of conspiracy \" not covered by the text of a federal law concerning sexual misconduct involving minors. Fogle said he would not have pleaded guilty but for the improper charge and said his imprisonment violates his due process rights under the u.s. Constitution. The habeas application named fogle's prison warden, the sentencing judge and u.s. President donald trump as defendants. A federal magistrate judge said the application was missing some details and gave fogle 30 days to submit a revised version that omits the sentencing judge and trump as defendants. Fogle was a subway spokesman for 15 years, and famous for losing more than 200 pounds ( 91 kg ) through exercise and eating subway sandwiches. In june 2016, a federal appeals court upheld his sentence, rejecting fogle's argument that it improperly exceeded the length recommended under federal sentencing guidelines.

Eastern connecticut took the brunt of the storm, with the highest snow totals recorded along the shoreline and rhode island border in new london and windham counties. The highest snow totals of the state have been recorded in thompson, which received 33.5 inches, according to the national weather service. Putnam, moosup, east killingly, lisbon, colchester, norwich, groton all received more than 2 feet of snow. Many parts of western connecticut, on the other hand, saw single-digit accumulations, as the heaviest band of snow veered east. More information on snow totals is available here. Flakes are still falling in some areas of connecticut but the storm is expected to move out by midnight. Winds"

        "summary": "More than six million monarch butterflies were killed in a single month in mexico, showing an increasing need \" to protect breeding, feeding, and migratory habitat, \" says a rep for the world wildlife fund. Experts who count the butterflies that migrate from the us and canada to mexico each winter say the insects covered about 10 acres in mexico last winter. This december, they covered 7.2 acres — a loss of 27 %, reports reuters. Experts say about 6.2 million butterflies, or 7.4 % of the population in mexico at the time, were likely killed when winter storms hit in march 2016, just as the butterflies were preparing to fly north, per a release. The storms brought rain and high winds that toppled 133 acres of butterfly habitat. It was the biggest forest loss in six years. However, experts say the loss of forests, also due to illegal logging, isn't the sole reason for the population decline. Milkweed, necessary food for monarchs, is becoming scarce in the us and canada with less open land and increasing use of herbicides. \" even if mexico's overwintering sites never lose another tree, \" the butterflies could soon disappear unless humans do more to prevent illegal logging and habitat loss, says a world wildlife fund rep. Referring to president trump's promised wall on the us-mexico border, however, an environmentalist says there are fears there will also be \" an environmental wall \" if environmental cooperation between the two countries ceases, \" and that its first direct victim might be the monarch butterfly. \" ( see why monarchs are a \" biological treasure trove. \" )",

The complaint filed friday on behalf of the 42-year-old cop, listed simply as \" officer john doe smith, \" names activist deray mckesson — arrested in baton rouge during a protest for alton sterling about a week before the attack on the officers — and four other blm leaders, per the los angeles times. The suit says blm and its leaders \" did nothing to dissuade the ongoing violence and injury to police \" and \" justified the violence as necessary to the movement and war. \" based on his age and documented injuries, john doe smith appears to be nick tullier, a sheriff's deputy and father of two, per wgno. And those injuries to smith set out in the suit, which cites violence at nationwide protests, were severe: he was shot through the side of his head, abdomen, and left shoulder, leaving him with a shattered skull and constant infections in his intestinal area. Mckesson tells cnn he's \" confident [ the suit ] has no merit, \" while his lawyer said in a court filing to dismiss a previous suit against mckesson that blm can't be sued because it's a movement, not an organization, per wafb. Donna grodner, an attorney behind both suits, countered, \" if black lives matter does not exist, it should not be raising money or collecting millions in donations. \" pbs notes grodner's attempt to crowdfund for legal expenses was rejected by youcaring for not \" promoting harmony. \" she's now trying to raise money via gofundme ( no word yet whether the site will allow it ).",

Even though many analysts have said the advent of truly autonomous vehicles is many years away, uber ceo travis kalanick apparently couldn't wait that long, reports bloomberg, tapping into robotics experts, engineers, and mechanics to beat tesla, google, and even old-school ford to the punch. Toward that end, uber will bring a fleet of custom cars — the ap notes it will consist of both the fusions and soon-to-come volvo suvs — to pittsburgh later this month so customers can commission temporarily free rides. It's all part of kalanick's plan to eventually phase out uber's human drivers and swap in the robots, which he says will make per-mile costs super-low and save lives. Not that these early driverless ubers will be completely sans humans. Engineers will be behind the wheel for now so they can wrest control if something goes amiss. And in the passenger seat, a \" co-pilot \" will observe and document each ride, in combination with the car's cameras, to find any bugs in the process. Safety remains the biggest issue right now: although the uber self-driving cars haven't had any accidents yet, the company's competitors have, and the autonomous uber vehicles are still having major problems with certain navigational obstacles — they have trouble going over bridges on their own, for example. What makes uber's foray into autonomous vehicles different from some of its competitors: it has no plans to manufacture its own cars en masse, but will instead forge alliance with carmakers to create its fleets.

In the washington post. He toned down the \" zany, \" and his \" problematic \" aim to pin back the ears of judges no doubt played well with conservatives. But he was rocked back on his heels by bachmann over the freddie mac issue, the \" one moment in the debate during which he did not seem at ease, \" notes dionne. Newt was a \" peevish \" loser, scoffs dionne colleague chris cillizza. Gingrich took a major hit on the freddie mac money issue and \" tried to save himself by drawing a distinction between consulting and lobbying that average people just don't grasp, \" notes cillizza. The winners were \" underrated debater \" bachmann, a \" forceful and energetic \" rick perry, and romney, \" at his very best \" until he headed into flip-flop territory, concludes cillizza. The only losers in the debate, as far as lucy madison at cbs news is concerned, were rick santorum and huntsman. Though gingrich was \" hammered hard \" over freddie mac, he rebounded quickly in the second half of the debate. Romney stayed smartly focused on president obama, and bachmann showed \" she knows how to take a punch. \" even perry \" seemed more confident. \"",

Homo naledi, which had a brain the size of an orange, \" looks like one of the most primitive members of our genus, but it also has some surprisingly human-like features — enough to warrant placing it in the genus homo, \" an anthropologist says. Researchers found 15 individuals of the species — including infants, children, adults, and seniors — after some rather slender scientists squeezed through a 7- or 8-inch-wide opening in the rising star cave near johannesburg and descended 40 feet to a chamber below, report the guardian and national geographic. Expert lee berger — who describes the species as \" long-legged, \" \" pinheaded, \" and \" gangly \" — says anthropologists explored various scenarios to explain why the remains were in such an isolated place, \" including mass death, an unknown carnivore, water transport from another location, or accidental death in a death trap, among others. \" but \" we have, after eliminating all of the probable, come to the conclusion that homo naledi was utilizing this chamber in a ritualized fashion to deliberately dispose of its dead, \" berger says. Others scientists are skeptical of that conclusion, and of the news that a new species has been found, arguing homo naledi may only be a primitive homo erectus, discovered in the 1800s. Dating the bones — which has been delayed because it will likely destroy the fossils — should eventually show where the species falls on the fossil record, and its relation to homo erectus.",

            "Billings - a judge's conclusion that a 14-year-old billings rape victim was \"as much in control of the situation \" as her school-teacher rapist has sparked outrage across the nation. Organizers have scheduled a thursday rally and a petition drive against district judge g. Todd baugh, who monday handed down a net sentence of 30 days in jail to former billings senior high teacher stacey rambold, 54, who raped 14-year-old cherice morales. The sentence came after rambold, 54, failed to meet sex offender treatment requirements and other conditions that would have ended the now six-year-old case. Morales killed herself weeks before her 17th birthday as her former sexual relationship with rambold became a criminal case. Under state law, children younger than 16 cannot consent to sexual intercourse, which makes rambold's crime felony rape. However, issuing the sentence baugh said morales not only had equal control of the rape, but was also a troubled youth \"older than her chronological age. \" the remark sparked public outrage, first from morales ' mother, auliea hanlon, and then from people calling for the judge to at least be censured.

Toronto-area couple anna kotlikova and blake weinzettl ordered pizza and soda from a nearby haunt, montana's, over the weekend, using ubereats so they wouldn't have to go out and pick it up. But as weinzettl tells mashable, their app showed the driver \" en route \" some 15 minutes from their location — though the restaurant is five minutes away. When the driver arrived, a second strange clue: he handed over food in a brown paper bag, which isn't the type montana's uses for take-away orders. Inside the brown bag, things were nightmarish. There was another bag weinzettl says was \" tied up very poorly, \" and inside that was a \" horrible mess of decaying food, \" including half-eaten moldy sandwiches so gross weinzettl called the whole thing a \" sick joke. \" he posted photos on twitter, and tells vice's munchies that uber has confirmed to him that it was not a mistake and the driver, who'd been inactive for two weeks, made only three trips on sunday, all of which were deliveries of moldy food he said he'd gotten from montana's.

The park suggests the world was created 6,000 years ago and that dinosaurs were still roaming when noah — who park organizers say lived to be 950, per the washington post — built an ark to house two of each animal, as told in the book of genesis. \" every single science exhibit [ located on the ark's third deck ] is absolutely wrong, \" says nye, who visited the site as a guest of his former debate partner and answers in genesis founder ken ham, per nbc news. \" this guy promotes so very strongly that climate change is not a serious problem, that humans are not causing it, that some deity will see to it that everything is ok. \" \" i ' m not busting anyone's chops about a religion, \" he adds. But \" it's all very troubling. You have hundreds of school kids there who have already been indoctrinated and who have been brainwashed. \" on facebook, ham appears happy with the \" clash of world views \" and opportunity to \" share the gospel \" with nye. He notes he took a moment to pray for nye, who \" said i could do whatever i want as he couldn't stop me. \" ham — who notes visitors to his nearby creation museum have doubled — aims to attract 2 million visitors to the 120,000-square-foot structure in the first year. A rep says 30,000 people visited in the first six days. However, nye says visitors — forking over $ 40 for an adult ticket — will see only a partially-finished ark. \" i guess they're using the same cranes noah used. The same brand, \" he quips.

        "summary": "Feeling gloomy? shed a few tears, then wait 90 minutes, and you ' ll probably be in a better mood. That's the word from researchers involved in a new study out of the netherlands that suggests crying actually boosts a person's mood, but not immediately. Scientists asked 60 participants how they felt before watching two tearjerker films, hachi: a dog's tale and life is beautiful ( la vita è bella ), then asked the same question immediately after the credits rolled, as well as 20 and 90 minutes later. The moods of the 32 participants who didn't cry during the films remained constant. But an interesting thing happened among the 28 who did shed tears: their mood took a dip after the film, returned to the level reported before the screening after 20 minutes, then climbed higher after 90 minutes, according to a press release. The act of emotional crying is actually somewhat of a mystery. Some scientists say it's a call for support, comfort, or help, while others say it relieves emotions. Studies focusing on the latter theory have turned up conflicting results that crying can better a person's mood or decrease it. This latest study may offer an explanation. \" after the initial deterioration of mood following crying that is usually observed in laboratory studies, it takes some time for the mood, not just to recover, but also to increase above the levels that it had before the emotional event, a pattern of findings which corresponds to the results of retrospective studies, \" the lead author says, per the telegraph. Criers may feel better because crying releases toxins, which may reduce stress, and endorphins, a natural pain killer, reports medical daily.

The agent told police 11 paintings worth a total of more than $ 300,000 were missing from the property, the chronicle reports. Police say kaylor sold the art through social media and pawn shops for much less than it was worth. As of monday, they had recovered nine of the stolen paintings.

        "summary": "A virginia man has been arrested and charged with abduction after law enforcement went to a home and found a woman and two children who'd allegedly been held against their will for two years. Fredericksburg.com reports that the break in the case came saturday, when sheriff's deputies went to a spotsylvania county home after receiving a tip from a concerned caller, who noted no one had seen the family members in some time. A man greeted the deputies but seemed \" reluctant \" to speak with them, and as that stilted conversation was taking place, a 32-year-old woman and two kids, ages 8 and 11, dashed out a side door and toward the safety of other deputies, who heard from the trio that they hadn't been allowed to leave the house for at least two years. Kariem ali muhammad moore, 43, was arrested for abduction and assault and battery; he's believed to be the boyfriend of the woman and the father of her two kids, per nbc washington. Investigators looking into the allegations say it doesn't appear the family was physically restrained or caged, but every window and door at the home was reportedly shrouded with blankets and other coverings. The kids apparently did not attend school during the alleged captivity. A sheriff's office rep says the woman was hospitalized due to unattended-to medical issues and is in serious condition; the kids were checked out and released to family. The sheriff's office says no missing persons report was on the books. Moore is being held without bond in rappahannock regional jail. ( a photo taken from a window led to a missing nc teen. )",

The study points out some startling statistics: more than 40 people die, on average, every hour from drowning ( about one person every 90 seconds ), resulting in 372,000 deaths per year. Men are twice as likely to drown as women, with possible reasons including ill-advised behavior such as swimming solo or drinking alcohol before taking a dip. More than 90 % of drowning deaths occur in low- and middle-income nations — and the numbers account for nearly two-thirds the deaths that malnutrition claims, and more than half that of malaria deaths, even though those two issues are the recipients of \" broad prevention \" initiatives, the report adds. In the us, the numbers are similarly sobering. An average of 10 people die daily from drowning; 20 % of them are kids 14 and under, the cdc reports — and for every child in that age group who drowns, five receive er care for \" submersion injuries. \" the study, which the who hopes will \" galvanize attention and action, \" notes that \" prevention is vital, \" as a person who starts drowning is often not likely to make it and because survival depends \" almost exclusively \" on how the victim is treated at the scene of the incident. Prevention methods on both the community and national level suggested by the who report include better swimming and water safety instruction; barriers ( e.g., pool fencing ) around bodies of water; and improved boating regulations, such as the cdc's tip to wear life jackets to reduce drowning risk.

Co-showrunner david benioff explains why sheeran was tapped. Adding a bit of surprising levity to the premiere, per mashable: euron greyjoy, who helped contribute to \" more laugh-out-loud moments than the show has had in years. \" his big scene involved trying to woo cersei lannister — and \" throwing epic shade at jaime. \" greyjoy didn't claim all of the laughter: the \" flirtation \" between brienne of tarth and tormund giantsbane enjoyed a few new moments in the spotlight, with insider noting fans are pulling for these two non-lovebirds to pull it together and get together.

According to a study published last week in jama ophthalmology, the woman in her 40s started complaining of deteriorating vision, eye pain, and lesions on her eyes. Study author kyle kirkland tells live science those are all symptoms of a severe vitamin a deficiency. He says people who don't get enough vitamin a can suffer from dangerously dry eyes, leading to symptoms such as the woman was experiencing. The only catch: vitamin a is plentiful in our food, and severe deficiencies are rare in the us. It turns out the woman's eye problems were caused by the weight-loss surgery she had a year earlier. The bariatric surgery made her stomach smaller but also created a bypass for part of her small intestine, which is responsible for absorbing both calories and nutrients. The surgery effectively reduced the amount of vitamin a her body could absorb. The woman's eye problems cleared up after she received vitamin a intravenously, but kirkland says that's not a permanent fix and not all eye problems caused by vitamin a deficiencies are reversible. He worries eye problems like those suffered by the woman will become more common in the us as weight-loss surgeries continue their rise in popularity.

        "summary": "Researchers have found a correlation between division i football games and increased reports of rape — and they frame the evidence of that link as \" robust. \" the december working paper from the national bureau of economic research used local-area crime data from the fbi to estimate that football games are behind an additional 253 to 770 rapes of college-age victims a year across america's 128 division i football bowl subdivision schools. The overall figure being bandied about is 28 %, that representing the overall jump in reported rapes by those ages 17 to 24 in the schools ' policing areas. The biggest jumps in reported rapes occurred on home-game days ( 41 % versus 15 % on away-game days ). On those home-game days, reports of rape perpetrated by strangers were found to rise 61 %, while those by acquaintances jumped 28 %.

As he fights for racial equality in selma, alabama, circa 1965 has an impressive 99 % rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: selma \" deserves major attention this awards season, \" particularly due to david oyelowo's masterful depiction of king as \" a man of flesh, blood, and foibles, \" peter howell writes at the toronto star. \" we see history as it unfolds, not as it has been encased in amber, in a movie that needs to be seen in these anxious days of renewed racial and cultural unrest. \" kenneth turan at the los angeles times calls selma \" a necessary film, even an essential one. \" ava duvernay directs the picture \" with passion and conviction \" and oyelowo is \" mesmerizing \" as he \" expertly \" captures king's body language and cadences. \" the heart of selma is the three separate 50-mile marches, \" turan writes, but the film is \" inconsistent and not always as strong as its strongest moments. \" \" even when it shows king as a scapegoat, adulterer, and martyr, selma presents him with care that would have made its subject proud, \" writes colin covert at the minneapolis star tribune. Oyelowo is \" both completely believable and someone we've never encountered before. \" there are a few missteps, but the film is \" a work of art... Brilliantly acted, beautifully shot, emotionally touching. \" moira macdonald agrees oyelowo \" captures king's musical cadence, his quiet magnetism. \" but more than that, \" history becomes breathtaking drama in selma; there's an urgent realism in the storytelling, as if we're seeing this just in time, \" she writes at the seattle times.

It seems the us has built one inside the sprawling oak ridge nuclear complex, complete with centrifuges, and american scientists use it to evaluate what is and isn't possible on the iranian side. \"we know a lot more about iranian centrifuges than we would otherwise, \" one anonymous expert tells the newspaper. The larger story describes how oak ridge and the nation's eight other atomic labs have been working together to provide crucial information to negotiators, often under tight deadlines. The times describes the effort as a \" manhattan project in reverse \" — that is, scientists aren't trying to build a bomb, they're trying to prevent one from being built. As talks resume in vienna, reuters reports that the biggest issue revolves around sanctions. Iran wants them lifted as soon as a deal is in place — the goal is the end of june — while the us wants to phase them out.",

        "summary": "We already know punctuation saves lives. Now a supreme court ruling proves it also makes or breaks legal cases. Per courthouse news service, the high court on monday upheld a prison sentence for avondale lockhart, who pleaded guilty in 2011 to child porn charges. He had been facing an eight-year sentence, but because of a prior conviction not related to child porn ( he had been convicted 10 years earlier for sexually abusing his 53-year-old girlfriend ) and a pesky oxford comma, he received 10 years. His sentence had been based on a statute that notes the mandatory minimum is required if there's a \" prior conviction … under the laws of any state relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward. \" it's the final comma in that series that led the supreme court to vote 6-2 that the phrase \" involving a minor or ward \" only modified \" abusive sexual conduct \" — meaning any prior conviction for the other two crimes, against a child or an adult, could count against him. It's a \" niggling grammatical point \" that \" makes a world of difference, \" the economist said in november. The magazine notes that \" involving a minor or ward \" could have been placed after each of the three crimes if it was intended to apply only to child-based offenses, or that semicolons could have been used to separate the three crimes if the child-oriented modifier was only meant to apply to the final crime. In explaining the court's interpretation, justice sonia sotomayor wrote it's \" basic intuition that when a modifier appears at the end of a list, it is easier to apply that modifier only to the item directly before it, \" especially if takes \" more than a little mental energy \" to carry the modifier throughout. But dissenting justice elena kagan, along with justice stephen breyer, disagreed, writing: \" imagine a friend told you that she hoped to meet ' an actor, director, or producer involved with the new star wars movie. ' you would know immediately that she wanted to meet an actor from the star wars cast — not an actor in, for example, the latest zoolander. \" ( another comma-focused legal case. )",

The study, while small, offers the first glimpse of how these chemicals, which have been shown to cause cancer, neurological diseases and developmental disorders, have been absorbed into people's bodies simply by sitting on a couch or breathing in dust, and offers a strategy for state and local bio-monitoring programs to test larger populations, experts say. The better people's exposure to these harmful chemicals can be tracked, advocates say, the better experts can understand how they make people sick, offering more ammunition for legislative change to regulate toxic chemicals. The findings also underscore the possible consequences of a california law passed in 1975 that",
            "A new peer-reviewed study found that people are contaminated with several toxic flame retardants rarely studied in the us, including one that has never before been detected in americans called tcep. Scientists tested urine samples of california residents for biomarkers of six chemicals, all of which were present. The scientists discovered a way to test for this class of toxic flame retardants ( phosphates ), which could open up a new wave of research into a group of pervasive flame retardants that were previously not studied nearly as much as some other flame retardants. Funded in part by the national institutes of health ( nih ), the study by researchers at silent spring institute and the university of antwerp was published online today in the peer-reviewed journal environmental science &amp; technology. \" we found that several toxic flame retardants are in people's bodies. When you sit on your couch, you want to relax,",
            "For the first time in decades, furniture free of toxic flame retardants is becoming widely available to consumers. That's because what's become the de facto national standard for flame resistance in furniture has changed after a public outcry. Still, consumers will need to request furniture that's completely free of chemical flame retardants at the many retailers offering it, such as ikea and williams-sonoma. A new peer-reviewed study we conducted, funded in part by the national institutes of health ( nih ), provides even more evidence that it's worth it for consumers to do so. We've long known about the presence in people of certain flame retardants, such pbdes, but our concern about contamination from a broader number of the chemicals has been confirmed. We tested urine samples of california residents for biomarkers of six chemicals that have been rarely studied in the us,"

The saga began when images began to appear on social media site weibo of an \" old friend \" who'd been visiting the same oil rig for several years in a row, reports the bbc. Just two days later, images of a whale shark hanging lifeless from a winch also surfaced, and two fishermen identified as liao and huang were quickly arrested. They were allegedly caught selling the meat for roughly $ 12 a pound, though they claim the shark was dead when they hooked it. Online outrage ranged from \" heartbreaking \" to \" i would like to string up whoever did this, \" but the demand for the friendly and docile whale shark is clearly there, with a single carcass fetching as much as $ 30,000 on the black market. Left to their own devices, whale sharks boast a longevity similar to humans, living as long as 70 to 100 years, reports the shanghaiist, but hundreds are killed every year and there may only be a few thousand left in the wild. The fishermen in this case face charges of \" illegal acquisition of rare or endangered animal. \" ( stateside, someone's been killing bald eagles in maryland, amounting to the area's largest die-off of the bird in decades. )",

        "summary": "Feathers, wishbones, colored eggs. If they're things you associate as only found in birds, you're wrong, says paleontologist mark norell. It turns out dinosaurs evolved all three, though we've only just recently learned about that last item. The discovery of fossil egg-shells in china has upended the conventional wisdom that all dino eggs were white, a belief born out of the fact that, as national geographic reports, lizard, turtle, and crocodile eggs are white. But as a study newly published in peer j explains, researchers now believe that a species of oviraptor named heyuannia huangi laid blue-green eggs. While fossil eggs often end up looking brown or black, the 67 million-year-old ones found in china seemed blueish, which led scientists to try — and, as it turns out, succeed — to identify bits of colored pigments. The two, biliverdin ( blue ) and protoporphyrin ( red ), are typically found in today's bird eggs, and the researchers speculate that the coloring may have worked as a protective camouflage. \" it was a huge surprise. I couldn't believe it, \" says co-author jasmina wiemann. The findings suggest the dinosaurs were at least partially open nesting, as \" colored eggs are present in most modern birds which build open nests, as the eggs are vulnerable due to periods without parental guarding. \" a 2015 report from cbs news on the initial findings shares another hypothesis: that male oviraptors may have provided care for the eggs, as is the case among their colored-egg modern bird counterparts.

        "summary": "A russian woman who watched perplexed as a lump appeared on her face and then moved from one place to the next discovered the lump was alive. Specifically, the woman had a parasitic worm, whose movement she tracked in selfies. Per livescience, the woman first photographed the lump below her eye near the nose before it moved to her eyelid and then to her lip, where the infestation caused some serious swelling. The case appeared this month in the new england journal of medicine, where it was reported that the 32-year-old patient saw an ophthalmologist after two weeks of the lump moving around her face. Dna testing subsequently revealed the removed creature to be the parasitic nematode known as dirofilaria repens. As livescience notes, it's ironically a species without much of an appetite for human faces. Dirofilaria repens typically infests dogs and other carnivores and finds itself unable to breed when a human becomes the unlucky host through the bite of a mosquito, typically in parts of europe and asia. The patient reportedly told physicians she'd traveled outside moscow to rural russia, where she'd been the victim of a lot of mosquito bites. While hundreds of cases have been studied in russia, dirofilaria repens appeared to move beneath the skin in only about 35 % of them. This patient made a full recovery once the worm was removed surgically.",

The reminder came after a man came very close to death trying to save his mother-in-law's dog from a fast-flowing river monday, the times of london reports. The man's wife threw him a life ring when she saw he was in difficulty and she desperately clung to the rope for 30 minutes to stop him being swept out from the suffolk harbor to sea before a lifeboat crew arrived, reports coastal scene. Lifeboat crew member keith meldrum says the water was \" incredibly fast-flowing \" and the man was close to death from cold and exhaustion when he was brought to safety. His wife had rope burns on her hands, while the dog was \" perfectly fine \" after being wrapped in blankets for 20 minutes. The man \" was exhausted from fighting so hard against the force of the water and was at a critical stage when we got to him, \" meldrum says, adding: \" everyone on the lifeboat crew understands the urgency and the temptation to jump in after your dog. But this is the second time this year we have had someone go into the harbor after their dog — and it's the second time they have been dangerously close to death by the time we have pulled them out. \" in a facebook post, the local branch of the volunteer royal national lifeboat institution notes that other people whose dogs fell in the harbor had the animals rescued safely after calling emergency services.

        "summary": "\" you know, sweetheart, this is why there aren't any grocery stores in the black community. \" that's what cincinnati police officer kevin brown told an 11-year-old african-american girl moments after tasing her for allegedly shoplifting $ 53 worth of food and clothing from a kroger on aug. 6. Police say the 55-year-old off-duty officer, also african-american, was working security at the store when he tried to apprehend three girls. In violation of department policy, he used a taser on one without warning and only turned on his body camera afterward, reports the cincinnati inquirer. \" that hurt my heart to do that to you, \" he tells the girl in the video released tuesday, before addressing store closures in black communities. An internal review took note of the latter comment, which comes a year after brown was written up for using a homophobic slur. Brown defended the comment, however, on his belief that \" the closing of a number of kroger stores in black communities … resulted from large amounts of theft losses, \" the review states, per abc news. \" this guy, from what i am hearing, has serious issues, \" says councilman wendell young, a former police officer. \" he's building a case that makes it difficult for us to continue with him as a member of the police department. \" but it's up to police chief eliot isaac to decide the officer's fate, which could include counseling or termination. While promising to review department policy relating to taser use on children, isaac on tuesday described brown's use of the device as \" unnecessary in this circumstance. \" police say the girl took a backpack, \" candy and beef jerky, as well as infant clothing, \" worth $ 53.81.

        "summary": "There are plenty of theories and explanations for the economic crisis that has afflicted the united states for years now, but they all miss the element of the continuing malaise — it's really about the bursting of the decades-long consumer spending bubble, writes david leonhardt in the new york times. \" discretionary service spending \" ( think education and entertainment ) has never fallen more than 3 % in a recession in decades — in this recession, it has fallen 7 %. \" if you're looking for one overarching explanation for the still-terrible job market, it is this great consumer bust, \" says leonhardt. \" we are feeling the deferred pain from 25 years of excess, as people try to rebuild their depleted savings, \" he says. No consumer spending means no business hiring. And this time, there is no more debt to tide people over. The big danger lies in government slashing spending or defaulting on the national debt. \" if governments stop spending at the same time that consumers do, the economy can enter a vicious cycle, as it did in hoover's day, \" writes leonhardt.

True ink has begun releasing hundreds of pages of fbi files in the hope that citizen sleuths will help solve the case, closed this year after the fbi \" exhaustively reviewed all credible leads, \" per oregonlive. True ink founder geoffrey gray says he received the case files — including evidence assessments and interviews with jet passengers — while researching a 2011 book on the hijacker, later branded db cooper, but couldn't review them all, per the washington post. \" we have access to all these original db cooper case files and we want help from the public, citizen sleuths to help solve this case, \" he says. Authorities have had almost no leads in the decades since cooper boarded the flight from portland, ore., to seattle on nov. 24, 1971. The only physical evidence is a cache of about $ 6,000 from the heist found along the banks of the columbia river in 1980, and theories abound. One retired fbi agent suspects he landed in a lake and died. Others believe cooper was really richard mccoy, who copied cooper's crime in 1972 and was later killed in an fbi shootout, notes fox 13.

Eric schmitt-matzen told the knoxville news-sentinel he had been called to a hospital because the dying boy wanted to meet santa claus, and that before the boy died schmitt-matzen gave him a gift ( provided to schmitt-matzen by the boy's mother ) and told him he was his no. 1 elf. Schmitt-matzen said that as he held the boy after he'd drawn his last breath, the boy's mother ran in crying; she'd supposedly left the room because schmitt-matzen said he couldn't do his job if anyone else in the room broke down. Now the news-sentinel, which published the story sunday, says it can't verify the story and thus is no longer standing by the account. The newspaper says the story came to them indirectly, through a known source, and they contacted schmitt-matzen to get his version of events. Additional investigation revealed that it may not have actually happened. Snopes and the washington post also contacted area hospitals, all of which denied that schmitt-matzen's story had taken place there.

But incorrect stock data on the popular google finance, yahoo finance and bloomberg sites appeared to be freaking out some investors monday evening, after test data was apparently misinterpreted by third-party providers to those sites. As of 11 p.m. Eastern, google finance said amazon.com inc. Shares were down more than 87 %, to $ 123.47. Previously, yahoo finance said amazon was down 74 %, to $ 248.49. In reality, amazon amzn, +0.89 % finished the day down 1.5 %, at $ 953.66, and was up 0.1 % in after-hours trading, according to factset. Apple inc.

        "summary": "Researchers in britain are trumpeting the benefits of taking aspirin daily following a new investigation that suggests it could cut the risk of certain cancers. Data from 200 studies indicates that bowel, esophageal, and stomach cancer cases and deaths could drop 30 % to 40 % if people took the drug every day. Specifically, if 1,000 people took 75mg each day for 10 years, another decade after that would see 16 fewer cancer deaths and one fewer heart attack death, researchers say. But there's a big caveat: aspirin has been linked to internal bleeding in the stomach and brain, and the above scenario would also lead to two additional deaths from bleeding. Indeed, according to researchers, if everyone ages 50 to 64 in britain took daily aspirin, it could save 122,000 people — but side effects would lead to an extra 18,000 deaths, the bbc reports. \" taking aspirin daily looks to be the most important thing we can do to reduce cancer after stopping smoking and reducing obesity, \" says one researcher. But he cautions that you should see your doctor before taking on such a regimen, the guardian notes, and he doesn't recommend taking it daily for more than a decade, given a growing risk of bleeding with age. And an outside expert is less certain: \" before aspirin can be recommended for cancer prevention, some important questions need to be answered and tests need to be developed to predict who is likely to have side-effects. \" previous studies show both benefits and drawbacks of the medicine — including possible blindness.",
