The wallace farm in waterbury was run by 71-year-old rosina wallace. Per usa today, wallace was a fourth generation dairy farmer at the property, which was purchased by her great-grandparents in 1866. Wallace hosted numerous school groups over the years at the farm, which was a staple attraction in the community. Per the ap, rosina wallace's home on the property also was destroyed along with another home and a cow barn. While all 23 animals perished, no human fatalities were reported. The barn and farmhouse were 152 years old, so the wood was extremely dry, said fire chief gary dillon. Investigators were not certain of its exact source on monday but said the fire has been ruled an accident. For rosina wallace and her brother, k. Alan wallace, who helped her run the farm, this is a tragedy only lessened by the outpouring of community support. Family and friends stopped by with food and to offer condolences and help throughout the morning monday. Meanwhile, the wallaces stood by monday as an excavator tore down the farmhouse where they both grew up and where he currently lived. \" it's holding me up, \" rosina wallace said of the support. Perhaps more tragic is the effect on the community. \" this is just a different world, \" she once said in a profile on the cabot creamery website. \" even for kids who grow up right next door, if they don't come visit the farm, they don't make the connections. \" wallace worked hard and long to keep the farm going after her father died, said former neighbor bob severidt. \" the cows were her kids, \" he said. \" and so she lost them and it's going to be a real heartbreaker. \"",

Though the fossils, at about 54.5 million years old, aren't quite as ancient as the earliest known perissodactyla remains, they help fill in details about the order's past. \" this is the closest thing we've found to a common ancestor of the perissodactyla order, \" says scientist ken rose.

Modern horses, rhinos, and tapirs belong to a biological group, or order, called perissodactyla.

Modern horses, rhinos, and tapirs belong to a biological group, or order, called perissodactyla.

            "Danang, vietnam — president trump said on saturday that he believed president vladimir v. Putin was sincere in his denials of interference in the 2016 presidential elections, calling questions about moscow's meddling a politically motivated \"hit job \" that was hindering cooperation with russia on life-or-death issues. Speaking after meeting privately with mr. Putin on the sideline of the asia pacific economic cooperation summit meeting in danang, vietnam, mr. Trump said that he had again asked whether russia had meddled in the contest, but that the continued focus on the issue was insulting to mr. Putin. Mr. Trump said it was time to move past the issue so that the united states and russia could cooperate on confronting the nuclear threat from north korea, solving the syrian civil war and working together on ukraine. \"he said he didn't meddle — i asked him again, \" mr. Trump told reporters traveling with him aboard air force one as he flew to hanoi for more meetings. \"you can only ask so many times. I just asked him again. He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election. He did not do what they are saying he did. \"",

        "summary": "A teenager in the uk who showed up at a hospital's pediatric unit complaining of stomach pain ended up getting an appendectomy — but it was something else entirely that had caused her distress, per an article in bmj case reports. Doctors weren't 100 % sure that the 15-year-old had appendicitis, though some of the signs ( including abdominal pain on her lower right side and nausea ) were definitely present. They ruled out irritable bowel syndrome, ovarian cysts, a uti, and even a particularly painful period. She wasn't throwing up, however ( another sign of appendicitis ), and blood, urine, and ultrasound tests weren't giving them a definite yes. But they decided to pull her appendix out anyway, as her pain wasn't going away and they didn't want to take any chances that it was indeed a life-threatening bout with appendicitis, a bmj press release explains. As they were in the process of taking out her organ, they noticed that her appendix was \" lily white \" instead of pink or red, per the daily mail. Then something unexpected caught their eye: a \" multitude of worms, \" which they quickly removed with a suction tool. Tests after the surgery confirmed the worms were of the e. Vermicularis ( aka human pinworm ) variety and that the girl hadn't had appendicitis after all. The teen and her entire family were given meds to fight the parasite — which is highly contagious, though not harmful — and she made a full recovery. It may have shocked her doctors, but bmj notes that while the presence of the pinworms is usually found in people who live in hot, humid climates with subpar sanitation, up to half of all kids in britain may have a related infection.

Clark county saw its record for single-day early vote turnout shattered friday when 57,174 people cast their ballots, according to data from the nevada secretary of state's office, as hillary clinton and democrats sought to build up a prohibitive advantage over trump before tuesday in the key state. Trump's lawyers asked for an order to have the pertinent early vote ballots -- those cast after the designated polling hours friday -- not to be \" co-mingled or interspersed \" with other ballots. Judge gloria sturman, of the district court for clark county nevada, ruled from the bench, saying gloria was already obligated by state law to maintain the records that the trump campaign is seeking. \" i can't obligate him to do something he is already obligated to do, \" sturman said, later adding, \" this is election day.

            "Washington ( cnn ) a nevada court judge forcefully denied a request tuesday from donald trump's campaign to direct a county registrar of voters to preserve and segregate ballots from voting machines in four early voting sites in the las vegas area where latino voters showed up in record numbers. The trump campaign said clark county registrar of voters joe gloria kept polling locations open two hours beyond their designated closing times. Clark county saw its record for single-day early vote turnout shattered friday when 57,174 people cast their ballots, according to data from the nevada secretary of state's office, as hillary clinton and democrats sought to build up a prohibitive advantage over trump before tuesday in the key state. Trump's lawyers asked for an order to have the pertinent early vote ballots -- those cast after the designated polling hours friday -- not to be \" co-mingled or interspersed \" with other ballots. Judge gloria sturman, of the district court for clark county nevada, ruled from the bench, saying gloria was already obligated by state law to maintain the records that the trump campaign is seeking. \" i can't obligate him to do something he is already obligated to do, \" sturman said, later adding, \" this is election day. He has other things to be doing. \" dan kulin, a spokesperson for the county",

An autopsy found that warren hills quarterback evan murray died from a lacerated spleen, the morris county medical examiner says, partly because the 17-year-old had an abnormally large organ that made it prone to injury, lehigh valley live reports. The laceration caused massive internal bleeding that led to evan's death, which was ruled an accident. The me also noted there was no sign of heart disease or head trauma. While school officials haven't said how exactly evan was injured, fellow players noticed he had \" taken a couple of hard hits … including a helmet to the stomach, \" the site notes. \" the last play before the half, he got hit and we helped him to the sideline, \" a senior tackle says. Although witnesses said evan seemed \" woozy \" after that final hit and had been slow in getting up throughout the game, no one feared the worst, cbs news reports. He even gave the thumbs-up sign as he was carted off the field and put into an ambulance, lehigh valley live notes.

        "summary": "Federal investigators believe that the gunman in the deadly wisconsin sikh temple shooting was a \" white supremacist \" who acted alone — and they classified it as domestic terrorism based in part on the messages tattooed on his body ( which reportedly include a 9/11 tattoo on one arm ), sources say. The shooter ( ided this morning as wade michael page ) had been discharged from the us army, sources tell nbc and the milwaukee journal sentinel. He was shot dead by a cop after he opened fire yesterday morning inside the oak creek temple, killing six, including congregation president satwant kaleka, who reportedly tried to tackle the shooter. Law enforcement officers quickly descended on the gunman's home, the upper level of a duplex apartment in nearby cudahy, and evacuated the neighborhood. The shooter, believed to be in his early 40s, reportedly rented the apartment just over a month ago. His only brush with the law appears to involve traffic tickets, notes nbc. Besides the tattoos, certain \" biographical details \" also convinced authorities that the shooting was domestic terrorism, a source told the los angeles times. A domestic terrorism label indicates a political agenda, according to law enforcement authorities, but sources say the gunman didn't appear to be formally connected to a hate organization or to a terrorist group. But two sources have told abc news that the shooter was apparently a \" white supremacist \" or \" skinhead. \" it is \" being investigated, \" said an atf agent.",

As flu season continues to wreak havoc across the us, brian herndon has been recuperating and drifting in and out of consciousness for weeks at dallas ' baylor university medical center, where he was airlifted on jan. 6 after being diagnosed with the flu just 48 hours earlier. The 51-year-old father of two was also hit with pneumonia, and soon after he was admitted to a fort worth hospital on jan. 5 he went into septic shock. Doctors were forced to amputate both of his legs below the knee and nine of his fingers after the septic shock caused blood clots to form. Herndon's wife, jaye, tells nbc 5 that he hadn't had a flu shot this year, and that the illness progressed so rapidly he'd never even had a chance to take the tamiflu he was given when he was initially diagnosed. \" he had a 104.7 temperature right away, \" she tells wfaa. \" and then he had trouble breathing. We didn't wait, we went to the er. It was that quick. \" a gofundme campaign that has raised more than $ 23,000 so far will use the money to pay for new prosthetic legs and additional medical care for herndon, including special work on his hands. His family hopes he ' ll be out of baylor's icu by the end of this week. \" every dollar will help show love to an amazing man!, \" the gofundme page notes.",

        "summary": "A meteor might explain why tomatoes are red, but humans are to blame for why they often have no taste. Specifically, the mass-produced ones found in the supermarket, notes sciencenow. Researchers led by a team at uc davis think they've figured out a key part of the problem: big growers like their tomatoes to be uniformly green so they know when to pick and ship them, and for years, they've been breeding them to get that desired effect. As it turns out, the same gene that makes them the right shade of light green also affects sugar and thus, flavor. The finding \"is one piece of the puzzle about why the modern tomato stinks, \" a florida expert not involved with the study tells the new york times. \"that mutation has been introduced into almost all modern tomatoes. Now we can say that in trying to make the fruit prettier, they reduced some of the important compounds that are linked to flavor. \" the good news is that the discovery could pave the way to better-tasting store tomatoes, though it may take a few years, notes the san francisco chronicle.

Consumers like tomatoes that are red all over, but ripe tomatoes normally had a ring of green, yellow or white at the stem end. Producers of tomatoes used in tomato sauce or ketchup also benefited. Growers harvest this crop all at once, dr. Giovannoni said, and \"with the uniform ripening gene, it is easier to determine when the tomatoes are ripe. \" then, about 10 years ago, ann powell, a plant biochemist at the university of california, davis, happened on a puzzle that led to the new discovery.

In the 17-minute recording posted on a jihadi website, a man purported to be al-baghdadi urges his followers to \"erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere \" and to \" light the earth with fire under all the tyrants and their soldiers and supporters, \" reports the guardian. The state department says it hasn't yet verified the tape's authenticity, reports abc news, but various media accounts say it sounds very much like al-baghdadi. One of those outlets is reuters, which reports that the speaker in the new tape calls specifically for attacks against saudi arabia's rulers. He singles out the nation as the \" head of the snake and stronghold of disease \" and urges people to \" draw their swords. \" the message makes reference to president obama's announcement of more troops for iraq, adding that us airstrikes against the islamic state \"have not prevented its advance, nor weakened its resolve. \" ( it doesn't, however, mention red bull. )",

The bbc reports that x-rays showed a spot on the man's lung, but it wasn't a tumor. It was a \" long lost \" toy traffic cone that had disappeared many decades earlier. Part of a playmobil set he got for his seventh birthday, the cone ( less than a half-inch in length ) had been inhaled by the youngster, then lodged in his lung, per the guardian.

They speculate that because the man inhaled the cone so young, his airway \" was able to remodel and adapt to the presence of this foreign body. \" it was eventually absorbed into the lung lining, where it remained undetected until last year, when the man, a long-term smoker, began coughing and spitting up yellow mucus.

What is very unclear: if bor has actually fallen to machar's forces, as he claims it has, per the bbc, which calls the assault on bor \" a clear attempt by mr. Machar to show his military power, which will strengthen his hand in any negotiations. \" as for those negotiations, machar says he that he is now willing to begin peace talks. But as the bbc points out, that addresses only one of the two key demands that regional leaders are insisting upon. The other: that the rebels agree to a ceasefire by the end of today. To the contrary, machar says he will not tell his forces to lay down their arms, but that such a proposal can be discussed during the talks, which are to take place in ethiopia. The afp reports south sudanese president salva kiir and machar are due to arrive in addis ababa later today.

She was told her latch was good, but one lactation consultant suggested her milk production might be impaired due to a diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome, and recommended some herbs. By day 2 of life, landon nursed for nearly 14 hours; johnson writes that she was reassured he was just cluster feeding, and she tells people that \" pressure \" is too light a word for the breastfeeding counsel she was given. \" you felt brainwashed... Like you were a horrible person \" if you turned to the bottle. \" nearly as constant as the nursing was the crying. \" i had no idea that he was inconsolable because he was starving — literally, \" she writes. Half a day later, they were discharged, with landon having lost 9.7 % of his birth weight. They spent fewer than 12 hours at home as a family: landon went into cardiac arrest caused by dehydration, and was taken off life support 15 days later. \" there is nothing wrong with supplementing, \" she counsels new moms. It's advice the california mom herself has taken, having breast- and bottle-fed daughters stella, nearly 4, and aliona, 18 months.

Plaintiff frank lucido alleges that one of his three dogs died and two others became seriously ill because of the dry \" kibble \" food, which the lawsuit blames on unsafe levels of propylene glycol and mycotoxins; the daily beast explains the latter are essentially a \" toxic byproduct of mold. \" the former is an fda-approved additive, and a vet tells ktul that while it's dangerous for cats, it hasn't been proven to be a danger for dogs. Purina also insists it's safe and is used in \" human foods like salad dressing and cake mix. \" one of lucido's attorneys says the suit has become a class-action one because of similar complaints that have been piling up over the years. Legal newsline reports the suit references at least 3,000 online complaints of dogs becoming sick or dying. Internal bleeding, liver malfunction, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss are among the \" consistent symptoms \" mentioned, per the suit ( which names these 8 kinds of beneful ). \" if it's a hundred or so, it's like, ' ok, a lot of dogs eat beneful; things happen, ' \" says lawyer jeff cereghino. \" but when i look at 4,000? holy hell, there's a lot of people out here. \" he tells the db that he hopes to get court permission soon to dig into beneful's ingredients and conduct the necessary tests. \" as soon as we are able to, and the federal courts move at a fairly rapid rate, we will get discovery, \" he says. Purina maintains that the suit is \" without merit \" and that the food is \" enjoyed by millions of dogs each year \" without problems. ( fireball whisky actually contains propylene glycol. )",

In the clip — which went viral on youtube but failed to make the contest's final round — a pastor facing an empty church comes up with a novel plan to boost attendance: substitute doritos for the communion wafers and ditch the sacramental wine in favor of pepsi. Although the ad, called \" feed the flock, \" will not air during the big game, christian groups are protesting, with one claiming the clip \" blasphemes the holy eucharist. \" the ad received over 100,000 views on youtube before being pulled from the site. The reaction: \" i ' m catholic … but i honestly laughed when i saw this, \" says danielle sullivan at babble. Even \" my kids who attend catholic school know the difference between the holy communion and a joke. Anyone who is strong in their faith won't be dissuaded by this commercial. \" still, says tom wasserman at mashable, this embarrassing corporate snafu \" showcases the downside of crowd-sourcing. \" watch news coverage of the incident:",

        "summary": "Jonathan saenz had been a nondescript conservative lobbyist in texas — until he learned of his wife's lesbian relationship, lone star q reports. After the revelation, he became one of his state's \" most extreme \" anti-gay voices, writes john wright. Specifically, saenz became president of the texas values group, known for fighting same-sex marriage and ordinances against lgbt bullying. Court documents of saenz's contentious two-year divorce from ex-wife corrine may \" explain saenz's seemingly abrupt transformation … to homophobic firebrand, \" says wright. Corrine filed for divorce in 2011; it was settled last year. A february 2012 court order mentions corrine's girlfriend, ercimin paredes, though saenz accused his wife of starting the affair in 2010, according to court documents. He became head of texas values in early 2012. During the divorce, saenz requested his wife be evaluated by a shrink known for working with sex offenders, and sought details about dates, travel, and presents exchanged with paredes, emails between the pair, and their work schedules. He tried — and temporarily succeeded until the order was overturned — to keep paredes away from his three kids. In the end, paredes wasn't included in the saenz's final divorce decree and it grants both saenz and his ex-wife joint custody. The huffington post lists some of saenz's beliefs: that same-sex marriage applies to incest and polygamy, activists want christians in concentration camps, and gay conversion therapy works. It also notes that reddit had a field day with the story.",

Leader kim jong un — who hadn't even been born when the last congress was held in 1980 — will officially preside over the meeting, though it's not clear whether he will address it, reports the ap. The meeting will elect a new party central committee, and analysts expect kim to promote younger officials loyal to him, including his sister, kim yo jong. State media said the congress, the seventh in the party's history, will \" unveil the brilliant blueprint to bring forward the final victory of our revolution. \" pyongyang, unusually, invited more than 100 foreign journalists to cover the event — but they're not being allowed inside the flag-draped \" april 25 house of culture, \" where the congress is being held.

The decision \" cannot be made until parents not only have had time to fully discuss the ramifications with their children, but also to hear from the child's advocate or counsel, who can explain to the parent the likelihood of the child ultimately prevailing in his or her own asylum case if left behind in the us ( as well as where the child is likely to end up living ), \" the aclu said. The issue was addressed during a status hearing in the continuing family separations case the aclu filed, cnn reports; as part of that case, sabraw previously ordered the government to reunite all children under age 5 with their families by last week, and the rest of the children by july 26. Justice department attorney scott stewart opposed the deportation delay but did not address the rumors in court. He said he would respond later in writing.

            "A new jersey community college professor is under investigation for berating a conservative student in a profanity-laced tirade that was caught on camera. Brookdale community college sociology professor howard finkelstein allegedly slammed his hand on a desk and screamed the f-word at a conservative student, christopher lyle, in a discussion about sexual harassment that another student captured on snapchat last wednesday. \"he's constantly called me into his office and told me i can't speak in his class because of my beliefs, \" lyle said. Joey smith, who captured the exchange on video, told fox news he was recording the sociology 105 lecture on his phone because he knew the \"unprofessional \" professor was going to do something \"offensive or stupid. \" the class at the time was discussing how women are victims of sexual harassment. When lyle interjected that men can be victimized by women and offered a personal example, finkelstein slammed the desk and shouted \"f*** your life! \" the two students accused finkelstein of using his class period to single out and bash lyle for his conservative views, telling a veteran in the class he's a \"murderer, \" and lecturing incessantly on white privilege. \"he constantly talks about white privilege and how i have privilege because i ' m a white male, \" lyle said. \"i don't believe that. I work 50 hours",

Brookdale community college said the professor, howard finkelstein, \" acted in an uncivil manner \" during a sociology class last week. The college is still investigating the incident, which spurred complaints of a hostile liberal environment where conservative viewpoints aren't tolerated. \" we apologize to this student and to all students in the classroom for the way in which this faculty member behaved, the college said. Brookdale respects the viewpoints of its students and faculty and values discourse and civil debate, the college said in the statement. Christopher lyle, the student targeted in finkelstein's outburst, said he appreciates the apology. \" i believe the school is doing the right thing, \" he said. The incident was part a pattern of finkelstein rejecting and disrespecting conservative viewpoints, lyle, 23, of toms river said. Echoing nationwide complaints from conservative college students, lyle said he is being discriminated against in the classroom for his conservative views. Finkelstein, a veteran professor, regularly tells lyle to \" shut up, \" has criticized him for owning a gun and dismissed his opinions as \" the reason america is not great, \" lyle said.

        "summary": "Up to half of all middle-aged and older men are affected by erectile dysfunction, and the answer may not be a little blue pill. Men who eat foods rich in flavonoids are less likely to suffer from the condition, and that risk is even lower if they also exercise regularly. So report researchers in the american journal of clinical nutrition, who asked more than 25,000 otherwise healthy middle aged men about their ability to have and maintain an erection sufficient for intercourse, with the data stretching back to 1986. Nearly 36 % of the men reported experiencing erectile dysfunction over the course of the study, and the researchers at harvard and the university of east anglia in the uk found that \" men in the highest compared with the lowest quintile of intakes of [ flavonoids ] had a 9 % to 11 % reduced incidence of ed. \" that benefit was greatest when men — particularly younger ones — consumed foods with three types of flavonoids: anthocyanins, flavones, and flavanones. In the us, the top sources of these are strawberries, blueberries, red wine, apples, pears, and citrus. \" in terms of quantities, we're talking just a few portions a week, \" says lead researcher aedin cassidy. And the benefit grew when exercise was added into the mix: the combination of the two dropped risk by 21 %, with the independent reporting that the findings build on earlier results showing a link between exercise and reduced risk of erectile dysfunction. And the benefits could be even greater: one study author says the dysfunction is \" often an early barometer of poor vascular function and offers a critical opportunity to intervene and prevent cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and even death. \" ( coffee appears to help, too. )",

Scientists have identified that foods rich in certain flavonoids cut the risk of men experiencing the sexual problem which affects up to half of all middle-aged and older men. The foods with the greatest benefits include blueberries, cherries, blackberries, radishes and blackcurrant, which contain anthocyanins; as well as citrus fruits, which are packed with flavanones and flavones.

Scientists have now found that eating a diet rich in flavonoids is as beneficial as walking briskly for up to five hours a week. By exercising and eating flavonoid-rich foods, men can cut the risk of experience ed by 21 per cent.

            "Federal employees at the department of homeland security call it the \"candy bowl, \" a pot of overtime money they have long dipped into to pad their pay even if they haven't earned it, whistleblowers say. This practice, which can add up to 25 percent to a paycheck, has become so routine over the last generation that it's often held out as a perk when government managers try to recruit new employees, according to these accounts. In a report submitted to the white house and congress on thursday, the federal office of special counsel ( osc ) details what it calls a \"profound and entrenched problem \" at dhs and a \"gross waste of government funds. \" based on the testimony of seven whistleblowers, the osc concludes that the pervasive misuse of overtime pay in six dhs offices, including four within customs and border protection ( cbp ), comes to $ 8.7 million a year. At issue is administratively uncontrollable overtime, known as auo, which is meant only to compensate for urgent and unanticipated work like that often undertaken by law enforcement agents. But carolyn lerner, special counsel at the osc, an investigative and prosecutorial agency, said in an interview that many employees across dhs now consider the overtime pay their due. She said the whistleblowers'testimony suggests that the department's bill for these improper payments is running in the tens of millions of dollars a year. Jose rafael ducos bello, whistleblower and supervisor for customs and borders protection in springfield, va., says that abuse of \"administratively uncontrollable overtime \" is rampant at the department of homeland security.

We are not questioning that, \" lerner said. \"these are employees sitting at their desks, collecting overtime because it's become a culturally acceptable practice. \" over the past year, as federal cuts have torn through department budgets, the use and misuse of overtime has become a matter of increasing concern among federal managers, employees and unions. Asked about the special counsel's report, a dhs spokesman said acting secretary rand beers has ordered a department-wide review of how auo is used and whether it complies with the law and other rules. \"dhs takes seriously its responsibility to ensure proper use of taxpayer funds, \" said spokesman peter boogaard. \"while many frontline officers and agents across the department require work hour flexibility"

At the end of july, health officials announced that a handful of zika infections had originated from mosquitoes in miami, florida. As of august 22, there were 37 locally-acquired cases in florida, mostly concentrated in a one square mile area of miami's wynwood neighborhood. Zika was discovered in the 1940s, but most people had never heard of it until last year. That's because for decades, zika outbreaks were sporadic and tiny, and the disease seemed to do little harm. That changed in 2015. A massive outbreak in brazil altered the scientific community's view of the mosquito-borne virus. Scientists learned that zika can actually be a lot more dangerous than anyone thought, causing devastating birth defects in fetuses and even miscarriages. In light of that, the world health organization declared a public health emergency on february 1 this year. Meanwhile, the virus has been on the move. To date, more than 60 countries and territories have reported mosquito transmission of the virus, and 11 countries have seen sexual transmission of zika.

Closely related to today's afro-asiatic lion, cave lions ( panthera spelaea ) apparently roamed from russia's far east to the british isles, as well as northwestern canada and alaska. They were big, with a shoulder height of nearly four feet, and stalked horses, reindeer, and maybe young mammoths, ifl science reports. It's unclear why they went extinct, but human hunting and climate change may have robbed them of prey. Only individual bones, parts of teeth, and carcass fragments have been found of cave lions until this year.

Honda says it recently learned about an incident on june 18, 2016, in which a man was using a hammer to make repairs on a 2001 honda accord when the airbag inflator activated and ruptured, sending metal fragments flying. Ramon v. Kuffo, 88, who did not own the vehicle but had taken apart the center console with the ignition switch on, died of head trauma a day after a neighbor found him bleeding from the face in the passenger seat of the car parked in his yard near miami, fla., reports the detroit news. The airbag had deployed and \" the rupture most likely contributed to his death, \" says a honda rep. Kuffo's death is the 12th in the us and 17th worldwide to be blamed on the faulty inflators, which have injured 180 in the us. Honda — which only learned of the incident with a legal claim in march, per the new york times — notes the accord had one of takata's most dangerous inflators with a reported 50 % chance of it rupturing in a crash. But though owners of the car were sent 12 recall notices over seven years, \" our records indicate that the recall repair was never completed, \" honda says. Almost 70 million airbags in 42 million vehicles have now been recalled due to the faulty inflators.

( photo: getty images ) washington — another person has been killed by an exploding takata air bag, but this time it wasn't the result of crash. Instead, it was someone trying to make repairs with a hammer. Ramon v. Kuffo, 81, of hialeah, florida, was working inside a 2001 honda accord using a hammer when the air bag inflator ruptured, on june 18, 2016. A medical examiner ruled his death accidental due to head trauma, according to a hialeah police report. It's the 12th u.s. Death attributed to the faulty inflators and 17th worldwide, including five in malaysia. Takata inflators can explode with too much force when exposed to prolonged airborne moisture and hot-and-cold temperature cycles. If that happens, the inflators can blow apart a metal canister and shoot out shrapnel which can kill or injure people. More than 180 people have been hurt in the u.s. Alone.

The study of almost 2,000 children aged 1.5 to 13 found that almost half of those who sleepwalked had a parent who did. Nearly two-thirds of kids whose parents both sleepwalked also did, while just a quarter of those whose parents didn't sleepwalk were somnambulists. \" it's definitely genetic, \" another researcher tells cnn. \" prevention is really the cure in these situations.

        "summary": "With political pressure rising, house speaker paul ryan spoke up friday on the question of whether jim jordan knew about sexual abuse by ohio state university's wrestling-team doctor decades ago, usa today reports. \" these are serious allegations and issues, \" ryan says via a spokesman. \" the university has rightfully initiated a full investigation into the matter. The speaker will await the findings of that inquiry. \" several wrestlers say jordan, an assistant wrestling coach at osu in the 1980s and ' 90s, knew that dr. Richard strauss allegedly abused wrestlers on a regular basis. Jordan denies it, and trump said thursday that he's behind jordan \" 100 percent. \" but more ex-wrestlers are telling tales of alleged abuse and sexual misconduct at osu — and not all by strauss. Six former wrestlers say sexually aggressive male visitors often harassed them at the osu training facility, politico reports. The men allegedly masturbated while wrestlers sat in the sauna or showered, or had sex with each other in athletes'training areas. Several sources say it got so bad that ex-wrestling head coach russ hellickson had to physically remove them and begged the school to get his wrestlers a private facility. One ex-wrestler says he saw jordan ( who worked directly under hellickson ) yell at the gawkers to leave the sauna. But others say jordan was a good man in a sexually deviant atmosphere. \" was there sexual misconduct? no one is denying that, \" says former osu wrestler george pardos, who calls jordan \" one of the most honest men i've ever known. \"",

        "summary": "At 18, elana simon is already the co-author of a study in the renowned journal science. The subject? her own rare liver cancer, which she was diagnosed with at age 12. Together with scientists, another survivor of the disease, her surgeon, and her dad, who runs a cellular biophysics lab, simon was able to discover what the ap describes as an \" oddity \" in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, which mostly hits kids and young adults: an abnormal protein inside the tumors, but not in healthy liver tissue, that may fuel cancer growth. Their analysis of cancerous tissue from 15 patients found every single one had the gene mutation that caused the protein. While more research is needed, the new yorker says the study suggests \" a precise diagnostic for fibrolamellar cancer, \" a cancer so rare only about 200 people are diagnosed worldwide each year. Surgery is the only effective treatment for the cancer — which simon herself underwent — but she learned there was no registry for affected tissue samples that could be collectively studied while working at a lab during a high school internship. With her surgeon's help, she took the initiative to begin collecting those samples, and has created a database for patients to share their data. \" it's crazy that i've been able to do this, \" says the new york city resident, whose next big endeavor will be studying computer science at harvard in the fall.",

( p. 1010 ) studied fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma ( fl-hcc ), a rare and poorly understood liver tumor that affects adolescents and young adults and for which there is no effective treatment. Fl-hccs from 15 patients all expressed a chimeric rna transcript and protein containing sequences from a molecular chaperone fused in frame with sequences from the catalytic domain of protein kinase a. The chimeric protein retained kinase activity in vitro. Such recurrent gene fusions in cancer may signal a role in pathogenesis and provide an opportunity for therapeutic intervention.

One of the unique issues that simon and others with extremely rare illnesses face is that there's often not enough data to know exactly how to treat them. There are approximately two hundred and thirty thousand new cases of prostate cancer each year in the united states, compared to roughly two hundred new cases of fibrolamellar. This means that doctors know far less about the progression of rare diseases — and, because there are so few cases, they are often misdiagnosed. Meanwhile, drugs for rare"
