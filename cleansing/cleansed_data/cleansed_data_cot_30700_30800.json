        "summary": "A mother of two has died in australia thanks to a $ 4.95 phone charger. Authorities say sheryl anne aldeguer, 28, was talking on the phone, plugged into a cheap charger that failed to meet australian safety rules, when she was electrocuted with 240 volts and died instantly. The filipino national was found dead in her apartment a day later in april, wearing headphones, with burns on her ears and chest. Her family had not yet joined her in australia. \" the voltage seems to travel up through the faulty charger into her phone, \" a rep for the department of fair trading in new south wales tells the sydney morning herald, noting aldeguer's earphones were attached to a laptop, which was plugged in to the same power outlet on the wall. The daily mail adds aldeguer was talking to a friend at the time, and the cord's lousy shielding caused the voltage to pass into her body, then complete the circuit by traveling through her headphones into her laptop and back into the wall outlet. Police are now warning consumers about the dangers of knock-off usb-style chargers, calling aldeguer's death a \" wake-up call, \" rt reports. Meanwhile, fair trading officers raided the mobile accessory outlet that sold aldeguer the charger last week. \" all the products have been removed. We went out there as soon as possible when we were notified, \" the rep said; the commissioner notes that many items seized were not compliant with australian safety standards. The owners of the outlet could face fines up to $ 875,000, plus a two-year custodial sentence, he adds.",

        "summary": "Those who visit the homepage of a rutgers mathematician could be checking his office hours or what papers he's written. But it's far more likely that they're there to access a link that appears, without fanfare, on a page mathematics phd student kellen myers has simply titled other. The \" mathematical ends \" page is a list of 19 mathematicians who have left this earth in unfortunate ways. There's the 20-year-old galois, who died a day after he was shot in the stomach in 1832. There's alan turing and dénes konig, both of whom killed themselves. Then there's gödel, who starved. Why did myers create the page, which he tells real clear science is his site's most popular? he's not sure. \" perhaps this is a page in honor of those whose lives ended in an unpleasant fashion, both those listed and those not. Or, it may simply exist to satisfy one's curiosity, \" he writes atop his list. What it shouldn't be, according to ross pomeroy at real clear science, is some kind of warning to mathematicians. It's a \" small, biased sample, and its results cannot be ascribed to mathematicians as a group. \" among the \" highlights \" of those results ( full list here ): galois was killed in a duel over politics or romance. His tragic last words: \" don't cry, alfred! i need all my courage to die at age 20! \" fortunately, he managed to note down \" what would become his mathematical legacy \" the day before the duel, myers writes. Niels abel, who lived to the ripe age of 26 in 1829, lived the life of the starving artist, with his work going unappreciated before he died of pneumonia. If he'd lived two days longer, he would have received a letter informing him he'd gotten a job as a professor. Gödel is one of two mathematicians on the list who starved; he constantly feared his food was poisoned and got around this fear by having his wife sample everything first. But when she became sick and couldn't, he stopped eating; he died in 1978. These horrible deaths have been going on for a while: the first one on the page dates approximately to the year 212 bc. Archimedes was killed by a roman soldier — even though the order was not to hurt him. More math reading: descartes'skull reveals a secret about his life.",

        "summary": "A 4-year-old uk boy is $ 130,000 closer to traveling to the us for cancer treatment after a mystery donor contributed that amount to the cause. Zac oliver was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in may, but he has the near-haploid strain of the disease, which affects just one in 200 childhood leukemia patients. He is thought to be the only child in the uk with that strain of the illness, the bbc reports. Friends and family have been working on raising the more than $ 650,000 needed to get zac to philadelphia for a promising new treatment the uk is not yet ready to deliver, according to a justgiving crowdfunding campaign for the little boy. Zac's mom, hannah oliver-willetts, says she was recently shocked with a phone call from someone who told her \" not to worry \" and to \" pack her bags. \" hours after the call, the massive donation appeared in the family's bank account, she says; the amount reportedly pushed the total to what the family needs to afford the car-t therapy and all associated costs. The 4-year-old's plight had already been getting big attention, with simon cowell pledging about $ 65,000 to the cause. With the goal reached, \" this means that as soon as all of the money which people have raised and told us about has been banked, we will be able to show the hospital of philadelphia and get financial clearance, \" zac's mom posted on facebook, per the shropshire star. \" as soon as we get financial clearance, we can send this to the embassy and get zacs visa confirmed.... We honestly can't express just how happy and excited we are right now to be able to say that we will be able to get zac the treatment he needs to have the best chance of survival. \" ( this man sang one garth brooks song for 36 hours straight for a great reason. )",

In honoring angus deaton, 69, the nobel panel noted that \" to design economic policy that promotes welfare and reduces poverty, we must first understand individual consumption choices, \" adding that \" more than anyone else, angus deaton has enhanced this understanding. \" deaton is a scottish economist who holds both us and british citizenship, notes the telegraph. His work \" has helped transform the fields of microeconomics, macroeconomics, and development economics, \" says the nobel panel. In a phone call, deaton said he was \" surprised and delighted \" upon getting the news, but he also spoke of weightier matters, including the world's refugee crisis. \" what we are seeing now is the result of hundreds of years of unequal development in the rich world, which has left a lot of the world behind, \" he said, per the guardian. The long-term solution is to reduce poverty in poor countries, but he doesn't see that happening \" for a very long time. \" one of his most renowned accomplishments was co-creating the almost ideal demand system in 1980, which \" opened a new door in researching consumer behavior, \" notes npr.",

        "summary": "Well, this is an, um, interesting change of pace: men's rights activists are up in arms over mad max: fury road, claiming the flick is feminist propaganda. One well-known blog is calling for a boycott, according to the hollywood reporter, but critics'reviews aren't likely to keep audiences away. ( the film has a 99 % positive rating on rotten tomatoes as of this posting. ) here's what they're saying: chris klimek at npr writes this \" visionary \" installment is \" a kinetic, hallucinatory, boldly feminist chase flick that, with its vibrant color palette, harrowing stunt work, and show-don't-tell style of yarn-spinning, leaves every marvel movie and every fast &amp; furious in its irradiated dust. \" it's the \" most visceral blockbuster since gravity \" and \" reinvigorates the doomsday genre like no film since the matrix. \" as for charlize theron's imperator furiosa, she's the \" true protagonist. \" director george miller's fury road is lovely, \" crazed art, \" writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. To boot, it's \" a gleefully violent — and improbably feminist — phantasmagoria that turns epic road rage and long stretches of vehicular omnicide into an eye-boggling joyride, \" he says. Furiosa and max, played by tom hardy, team up to take down a warlord, but furiosa is \" the brains and heart of the operation \" and \" much more interesting than max. \" in the works for more than a decade, the flick is well worth the wait, writes kenneth turan at the los angeles times. It \" will leave you speechless, which couldn't be more appropriate \" as the film favors action over dialogue. You could actually mute it and still enjoy yourself, he says. The editors and production designers deserve serious credit, but the lion's share goes to miller for creating this crazy \" post-apocalyptic extravaganza. \" it may not always make sense, but it's \" hell on wheels, \" powered by \" miller's indisputable visionary genius, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. \" that the characters come through so vividly is a tribute to the actors, \" he says, shining a light on a \" terrific \" nicholas hoult, who plays one of the warlord's minions. \" but this is theron's show, \" he adds. \" get prepped for a new action classic.

Us district judge george daniels ruled that the evidence — including \" 20th hijacker \" zacarias moussaoui's claim that saudi royals funded al-qaeda — wasn't enough to remove the \" sovereign immunity \" that shields other countries from lawsuits, meaning saudi arabia couldn't be named as a defendant in the long-running case, the ap reports. Daniels said allowing new evidence would be \" futile \" because \" the additional allegations do not strip defendants of sovereign immunity, \" reports reuters. The lawsuit, which seeks billions of dollars in damages began in 2002. Saudi arabia was removed as a defendant in 2005 because of sovereign immunity, but the 2nd circuit court of appeals reinstated it in 2013, pointing to a similar case involving afghanistan, reuters notes. A lawyer for the plaintiffs says an appeal is planned and blames the ruling on the government's decision to keep material that could help the plaintiffs ' cause classified, the ap reports. A lawyer for saudi arabia says the case is based on \" innuendo and supposition, \" reports the wall street journal, which notes that the number of defendants being sued used to be in the hundreds but now stands at around a dozen.

But kristen king, who's written for cosmo, says the move shows \" another double standard for women \" since magazines like men's fitness aren't affected. \" saying it's inappropriate for children to see women's bodies teaches children that women's bodies are inappropriate, \" king tells the bbc. \" the more conversations we have about women's health and sexuality the better. \"",

Now 38, landry is returning to what the mansfield journal of ohio calls \" the local trial of the century. \" on nov. 13, 1989, dr. John boyle and his pregnant mistress began the process of purchasing a $ 299,000 home in erie, pennsylvania. Four days later, wife noreen filed for divorce from her high-school sweetheart, citing extreme mental cruelty and gross neglect. Before the year was out, she was dead. On new year's eve, boyle killed noreen, whose body was found buried below the basement floor of that erie home three weeks later. The journal separately notes that in the days before the murder, boyle rented a jackhammer and inquired about the soil under the basement floor. On the night in question, landry heard an argument, a scream, and a thump. Boyle had hit noreen and suffocated her using a plastic bag, police say. Now landry — who goes by his middle name — is an la-based cinematographer who is working on a documentary on the case, which had some weird twists: after boyle was sentenced to 20 years to life, he successfully appealed to have the body exhumed, arguing that based on the weight noted by the coroner, it wasn't noreen's — even though her rolex and gold cross were noted on the remains, reports the columbus dispatch. Dna testing proved it was her. Landry won't reveal much about the film, other than to say he's hoping to reconnect with little sister elizabeth, who he hasn't seen since she was adopted by another family 26 years ago.",

So what changed desmond-harris ' mind? for starters, she explains, words have more power than we may think, and the way we verbally describe ourselves shapes how we actually perceive ourselves; even women who think they're perfectly comfortable using \" you guys \" may be unconsciously doing themselves a disservice. She quotes a 2002 qualitative sociology article to back up her point: \" we can use words to maintain the status quo or to think in new ways — which in turn creates the possibility of a new reality. It makes a difference if we talk about ' negroes ' or ' african-americans. ' \" she acknowledges it can be hard to reverse our programming, but a professor of social work at nyu recently pointed out to her in an email that it used to be common to write \" he \" as an indicator for both genders, until \" the second wave of feminism with all of the revelations about gendered words \" came about and we started using he/she.

After three decades of research, mel greaves, from the institute of cancer research in london, believes that acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) is caused by a lack of exposure to germs in the first year of birth combined with a genetic mutation that affects one in 20 children, reports the guardian. Greaves details his theory in the journal nature reviews cancer. The most common type of childhood cancer, all affects one in 2,000 children and is increasing by a rate of about 1 % annually. Most of the increase is in affluent populations. It is least common in poorest areas, where families are larger and children are exposed to more germs. Once a death sentence, today 90 % of children recover from all with chemotherapy, but treatment can have long-lasting health consequences. Greaves recommends that parents make a point of bringing children under the age of one into contact with others. Cancer researcher charles swanton believes the research is an important advancement in the medical community's understanding of how all develops but stresses that parents are not to blame for their child's cancer and that many factors are at work. Sheena cruickshank of the british society for immunology goes a step further and cautions parents not to go overboard on the recommendations. Despite the findings, she says in a statement, \" infections themselves can pose a significant risk for young babies with a developing immune system, \" per cnn.",

The judge declared the state's ban on gay marriage unconstitutional, reports the pittsburgh post-gazette. \"by virtue of this ruling, same-sex couples who seek to marry in pennsylvania may do so, and already married same-sex couples will be recognized as such in the commonwealth, \" wrote us district judge john jones. His decision makes gay marriage legal throughout the northeast, notes ap. The state is expected to appeal the ruling to the 3rd circuit court of appeals, though gov. Tom corbett will have to do so without the help of his own attorney general. Kathleen kane previously called the ban unconstitutional and refused to defend it, prompting corbett to turn to the office of general counsel to make the state's case. In siding with 11 gay couples, two teen children of one of those couples, and a widow, jones didn't just strike down the ban, he did so with relish. \" we are a better people than what these laws represent, and it is time to discard them into the ash heap of history, \" he wrote.",

Those that fail to prove pay parity will face fines. \" the legislation is basically a mechanism that companies and organisations... Evaluate every job that's being done, and then they get a certification after they confirm the process if they are paying men and women equally, \" said dagny osk aradottir pind, a board member of the icelandic women's rights association. \" it's a mechanism to ensure women and men are being paid equally, \" she told al jazeera. \" we have had legislation saying that pay should be equal for men and women for decades now but we still have a pay gap. \" { articleguid } iceland, an island country in the north atlantic ocean that is home to approximately 323,000 people, has a strong economy, based on tourism and fisheries. For the past nine years, it has been ranked by the world economic forum ( wef ) as the world's most gender-equal country. The global gender gap report uses markers such as economic opportunity, political empowerment,"

Most of them ended up in the notorious wauwilermoos prison camp after being shot down or forced down by nazi fighters, and subsequently trying to escape internment to rejoin their units. \" there wasn't too much food and we'd fight over who got the largest piece of bread. It was dirty and miserable, \" a former prisoner told the christian science monitor in 2003. \" it was swampland. You got off the train and you sank a foot.

        "summary": "The hunt for an abandoned whaling fleet took noaa archaeologists to what they describe as \" one of the planet's most unexplored ocean regions \": the waters off the arctic coast of alaska. There they say they've found two ships that have slumbered in the deep for almost a century and a half. And while the shipwrecks are associated with no human toll, an noaa press release explains they did contribute to a death of sorts. The backstory: in september 1871, 33 of 40 whaling ships operating in the north pacific — a group that had dwindled from 292 ships 25 years prior — found themselves trapped in ice. They were near the shore, and in prior years, the wind typically shifted, pushing the ice seaward and effectively unlocking the ships. That didn't happen that year, leaving 1,219 people \" stranded at the top of the world. \" incredibly, they all survived, having made the decision to row 90 miles in whaling boats to the seven ships that had escaped the ice, reports ktva. Still, the noaa explains that the event is viewed as \" one of the major causes of the demise of commercial whaling in the united states. \" a project co-director explains to the alaska dispatch news that while items have washed ashore over the years, no items tied to the lost fleet had been found beneath the water. Using modern sonar and sensing technology and aided by an absence of ice in the chukchi sea, the \" magnetic signature \" of the two ships was established down to the \" outline of their flattened hulls. \" and while sea ice typically proves unfriendly to such relics, \" we found artifacts that were just sitting \" there in the fall of 2015, perhaps long protected by a sandbar. Among the finds: pots that rendered whale blubber into oil. ( the ancient shipwreck capital of the world has been found. )",

        "summary": "Every pope, jesus, moses, muhammad, and most other major religious leaders have been men, and many religions have either only recently let up restrictions on women officiants or continue to ban them, the guardian notes. Yet a new study from the pew research center finds that women are the ones who are more devout in their faith, especially christians. About 83.4 % of women around the world say they identify with a religious group, while only 79.9 % of men do, per 2010 figures — that's about 97 million more women than men. The \" gender gap in religion around the world \" report administered surveys in 192 countries and territories and found women make up 54 % of individuals identifying as buddhists, 53 % of christians, and 52 % of jews; muslim adherents are split down the middle, while men have a slight advantage in the numbers among hindus and traditional/folk religions ( 51 % to women's 49 % ). The group that claimed no religion affiliation ( e.g., atheists, agnostics, and those who say they're \" nothing in particular \" ) is made up of 55 % men, 45 % women. Christian women also attend religious services more often in 81 countries surveyed for that particular question ( though men head out to worship more if they're orthodox jews or muslims ), and women pray more both in public and private, according to surveys in 84 countries. The genders in 63 countries are generally about even in whether they believe in heaven, hell, and angels. So what accounts for this gender gap among the devout? while the report notes there's no definitive agreement, religious scholars have pointed to a variety of both nature and nurture factors, including \" biology, psychology, genetics, family environment, social status, [ and ] workforce participation, \" as well as \" a lack of ' existential security ' \" woman may experience because they're more likely than men to be adversely affected by poverty, sickness, old age, and violence.

            "A california mom is feeling praise from moms around the internet after sharing a note that her teenage daughter asked her to write. Nicole poppic, from clarksburg, california, is done coddling her teenager daughter, cara. Like any high schooler, cara had a little trouble getting out of bed earlier this month, causing her to be late for class. But in most schools, an unexcused lateness can lead to punishment, so cara asked her mother for a note to excuse her tardiness. Unfortunately for cara, the note was more incriminating than anything else, and poppic blamed the whole ordeal on cara's teenage-ism.

Such is the tragic tale out of india, where a mother of twin 3-year-old boys says she stepped out of their delhi home for six minutes to grab laundry detergent and came home to what appeared to be an empty house, reports the hindustan times. The truth was even worse. When her husband rushed home from work to help look for twins nishant and nakshya ( the parents even began scanning cctv footage taken outside the house in case of a kidnapping ), he ultimately found them stuck head-down in their top-loading washing machine, which had filled with enough water to drown them both. They were rushed to the hospital, but they'd been without oxygen for too long. While officers have found no evidence of foul play, an inquiry into the boys'deaths is likely, and their bodies are being autopsied, reports the indian express. It appears that the boys, who'd just been undressed for a bath, climbed onto the pile of clothes next to the washing machine, peered inside, and fell head-first into the small space, unable to move or escape. \" they came into this world naked, they have left naked, \" their grandmother mourns. The couple have a 10-year-old son who was at school during the tragedy, reports the independent. \" the family is inconsolable, \" a police officer tells ndtv.

        "summary": "President obama and mitt romney are both planning a series of campaign events in ohio as election day draws nearer, and a new quinnipiac university/new york times/cbs news poll finds that working-class voters in that state are likely key to obama's re-election. Obama and romney are about even among white voters without college degrees in the state, a fact that is helping obama to hold a slight overall edge there. That contrasts to florida and virginia, where romney holds a 30-point edge among working-class voters, and the races are basically tied. More from the latest polls: most americans think obama will win the election — and they have a good track record when it comes to predicting the presidential winner, getting it right in gallup surveys in each of the past four elections. Before hurricane sandy, gallup found that 54 % of americans believed obama would win, compared to 34 % who gave the edge to romney. A reuters/ipsos poll finds similar results: while the race is still highly competitive — basically tied — 53 % of all registered voters predict obama will win, compared to just 29 % predicting romney. That poll also found that out of the 22 % who have already voted, 55 % voted for obama and 40 % voted for romney. Meanwhile, vladimir churov — who heads russia's central election commission and is known there as \"the magician \" for maybe knowing a little something about fraudulent elections — has slammed the us election system as \"not direct, not universal, and not equal, \" reuters reports.

Clinton makes clear that she believes the man did the deed. \" i had him take a polygraph, which he passed, \" she recalls in the recording, \" which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs. \" but she managed to destroy the prosecution's case because the crime lab made the odd decision to slice out a key part of the defendant's bloody underwear for testing and then discard it. This left the prosecution without evidence, so clinton got them to agree to let the man plead to a lesser crime.

Critics called the study racist, and researchers shied away from closely examining father absence for years — but a new study by princeton and harvard scientists published in educationnext analyzes some of the trends from the original report. Most notable: that half of us kids will end up living with an unmarried mom by the time they're 18, and kids of all races who grow up without a biological dad increase their risk of antisocial tendencies, including increased aggression and a refusal to abide by rules, notes a press release. Since moynihan's original study, the percentage of kids raised by single moms ( based on marital status, not living arrangement ) has risen from 25 % to 50 % in black families, and from 7 % to 19 % among white families. Single moms today are also more likely to never have been married, lack college degrees, and experience poverty more than households with two parents. \" children growing up with a single mother are likely to be doubly disadvantaged, \" says study co-author sara mclanahan. \" they spend less time and receive less money from their biological fathers.... [ and ] the mother... Has lower earnings than the typical mother in a married-parent family. \" the study's authors suggest more incentives for women to further their education, encouragement to use better contraceptives, and a push to help young fathers make economic inroads.

        "summary": "The new york post has been going to town publishing not-safe-for-work photos of melania trump from her early modeling days, but it's the timeline behind those images that's now raising more eyebrows. Politico backtracks through trump's progression from slovenian visitor to us citizen, noting dates that place trump in new york in 1995 for that photo shoot, though she has said she didn't arrive in the us until 1996. But her visa status back then is posing more of a problem, and immigration experts tell politico it may place her citizenship in jeopardy — problematic considering her husband wants to crack down on illegal immigration if he's elected president. The discrepancy comes from two interviews trump did earlier this year about her early us visits, in which she said she'd return to europe every few months to \" follow the law \" and get her visa restamped, until she got her green card in 2001. But that doesn't jibe with the h-1b work visa she should've held at the time ( that visa lasts for three years and can be extended for up to six without return trips home ). Instead, her description sounds more in line with that of a temporary business or tourist visa that lasts just six months — and that doesn't allow visitors to work here except in very limited circumstances, meaning trump may have lied about her reasons for coming into the country and committed visa fraud. If visa fraud did indeed take place, that could have a domino effect on her green card and citizenship applications. Donald trump's campaign had just a brief statement from rep hope hicks in response to politico's emailed questions: \" melania followed all applicable laws and is now a proud citizen of the united states. \" ( meanwhile, melania trump's website has fallen off the map. )",

Instead, top pakistani generals knew where bin laden was — in fact, as hersh puts it, \" bin laden had been a prisoner of the isi at the abbottabad compound since 2006, \" and a pakistani official revealed the information for a large portion of a $ 25 million reward the us had put forward in 2001. Hersh bases his report largely on an anonymous source he describes as \" a retired senior intelligence official who was knowledgeable about the initial intelligence about bin laden's presence in abbottabad. \" obama did order the navy seals raid on the compound, but it didn't happen the way the white house has said, hersh writes. \" there was no firefight as they moved into the compound, \" the source says. Bin laden, who was an \" invalid, \" was simply shot. Ensuing accounts, including president obama's speech, provided inaccurate details. Though obama acknowledged working with pakistani intelligence, the account by john brennan, now the cia head, rejected the idea that pakistan had any knowledge of bin laden's location.

Not surprisingly, his promise won't need to be tested: election results out today show the 89-year-old won a seventh term over prime minister morgan tsvangirai by a margin of 61 % to 34 %, reports the bbc. What's more, his zanu-pf will control two-thirds of the seats in parliament and thus have a free hand to change the constitution as it sees fit, reports ap. Tsvangirai has already called the vote a farce and promised to challenge the results in court. Zimbabwean writer petina gappah agrees with tsvangirai in a column at the telegraph, though she doesn't hold out much hope the results will be overturned. She does, however, see one silver lining in the form of the nation's new term limits. \" come what may, there will be no president mugabe of zimbabwe in 2023, \" she writes. \" now that is something to look forward to. \"",

For an unknown reason, when a t-mobile customer calls 911 the system creates multiple \" ghost calls \" to 911 that register as hangups. Actual callers get put on hold while 911 operators play catch-up attempting to call back all the hangups. The glitch has apparently gotten worse in recent weeks. According to cbs dfw, dallas wants its 911 operators to respond to calls within 10 seconds. On saturday night, 442 911 callers were put on hold for an average of 38 minutes each. While 911 operators were frantically dealing with ghost calls, 6-month-old brandon fell off a bed and wouldn't wake up. \" this hurts so bad, \" brandon's mother tells wfaa. Bridget alex left brandon with a babysitter while she went to her nephew's funeral. After brandon fell, the babysitter — who the dallas morning news reports didn't have a car — tried cpr and called 911. She waited on hold for 55 seconds and hung up. She still couldn't get through to an operator on the second try. On the third 911 call, the babysitter waited on hold for more than 30 minutes. Alex sped home and took brandon to the hospital; he was pronounced dead nearly two hours after the first 911 call. Alex blames the city and t-mobile for not getting the issue fixed back in november, but the city says there's no evidence the ghost calls contributed to brandon's death.

Armstrong's mantel looks to be one award lighter, reports the ap, which spoke to sources that say the ioc has stripped the cyclist of the bronze medal he won at the 2000 olympic games in sydney. The ioc reportedly sent him a letter last night requesting its return, after the 21 days armstrong had to appeal his stripped tour de france wins expired. ( oh, and cycling could get axed altogether from the olympics, thanks, in part, to armstrong. ) in other news: the interviews about the interview continue. Armstrong yesterday spoke with the ap about it via text, addressing rumors that he was \" not contrite \" when speaking with oprah. \" i left it all on the table with her and when it airs the people can decide, \" he said, adding this maudlin statement: \" i have no idea what the future holds other than me holding my kids. \" debating whether you want to tune in? does the idea of tears make it a more intriguing proposition? a source tells the new york times armstrong \" teared up and cried \" during the interview. And — melodrama alert — the same source said the stories armstrong shares are like \" a classic shakespearean tale. \" his tale won't likely include an invite to this year's big-deal tour de france, which will be the 100th occasion of the ride. The ap reports that all riders who have finished a tour de france have been invited for the final day, but when asked if armstrong would receive an invite, the race director said, \" that seems to me to be out of place now. \" gloomy side note: armstrong may have forever ruined the movie dodgeball.",

As for gold medals, norway and the us are predicted to tie for the top spot with 13 each. Germany and canada are also in the top four there, predicted to walk away with 10 and nine gold medals, respectively. What are the factors at play? well, consider that norway has already racked up the most winter olympics medals of all time and the most gold medals from the winter games. Their athletes are focused on nordic sports like cross-country and ski jumping: \" we concentrate where we can do well, \" explains an international olympic committee member who organized the 1994 lillehammer games. Meanwhile, the us gets a boost from three newly-added competitions in sports at which it excels: snowboarding, freestyle skiing, and women's ski jumping. But one big problem for the us? many important athletes are struggling with injuries. A very different model — one that focuses on statistics like a country's gdp and exports rather than the athletes themselves — predicts the us will win out with 29 medals total, while norway will only grab 16, smithsonian reports. And if you'd rather look at betting odds for your prediction, the most recent story on sb nation says the odds basically agree with the journal: norway is favored to be the top gold medal-winner, followed closely by the us, while the us is favored to bring home the most overall medals, followed by norway.",

He brought only one board, a pair of trunks, and a backpack -- living, as they say, free and easy. As he got out of the water after his first session, he was greeted by a group of local kids on the beach. One of them asked andy if he could have andy's board, or his sunglasses, or anything. Andy explained that it was the only board he had on him and he needed it for the rest of the trip, but he'd give the kid his t-shirt. The kid's face lit up as andy happily gave him the shirt off his back.

        "summary": "Mcdonald's is ubiquitous, but brian thompson has been obsessed with one particular location in ohio — and one menu item that's gone missing from virtually every other mcdonald's. That item is pizza, and as cara giaimo explains in atlas obscura, the journalist got it in his head that he was going to find out why the fast-food chain phased out the pies, a short-lived experiment from 1989 through the early ' 90s, and put together a podcast dedicated to the subject called, well, whatever happened to pizza at mcdonald's? the reasons for the pizza fizzling out soon emerged — from boxes that were too big to slide through drive-thru windows to an overall lack of interest in pizza from a hamburger joint — as did the two places that still serve it: a mickey d's in pomeroy, ohio, and another in west virginia. As thompson explains in the kickstarter he set up in december to pay for a trip to pomeroy, he was determined to offer an \" invaluable firsthand perspective \" by chowing down on a long-awaited slice of the elusive edible. Giaimo's piece looks at the quirky quest that morphed into 34 podcasts, which included interviews with other journalists, private detectives, and even dial-a-prayer hotlines. Then, of course, there was the season 1 finale that aired march 1, in which thompson finally tries a sample. But just because he's now come to the ostensible end of his chase, the podcast isn't over. \" as existing mysteries deepen, new ones crop up, too, \" giaimo writes, meaning there's going to be a season 2 — and an even deeper dive into fast-food novelties. More on his pursuit of the mcdonald's pie here. ( mcdonald's may bring back another lost menu item thanks to a cartoon character. )",

She consolidated her belongings into one bag, but no luck. The bag was too big, and she would have to pay $ 50. Trouble was, she only had cash, and the airline only took credit cards. Cassidy had just returned from europe and her bank, unaware that she was back, was declining her credit cards. The airline rep told her she needed to go back and pay at the ticket counter, which would mean missing her flight. \"i ' m pleading, devastated after a long day of travel, \" she posted on twitter. \"then, this man walks up and says, ' how much is it?'they tell him $ 50 and he says ' i got it.

Cassidy, who according to her twitter profile attends law school at arizona state, was boarding a flight when she was informed by the american airlines gate agent that she would have to pay to carry on her bag. She tried to consolidate her bags, but after measuring, the gate agent told her she would have to pay $ 50. Cassidy, who had just returned from a european trip, said her credit cards weren't working. She tried to pay cash at the gate, but the agent told her she'd have to go back to the ticket counter to pay with cash. That would've meant missing her flight. She tried to plead with the gate agent, who wouldn"

        "summary": "\" it is the end of a great adventure, \" says samir al-haddad at the royal museums of fine arts of belgium. Belgian researchers say they've found the fourth and final piece of a surrealist master's missing work, ending a search that's lasted more than 80 years, npr reports. According to the bbc, the enchanted pose by rené magritte was exhibited in 1927 but disappeared in 1932. The only evidence it ever existed was a black-and-white photo from the original exhibition catalog. The surrealist painter died in 1967 without ever saying what happened to the painting, but experts believe he cut it up to reuse the canvas. \"it was the late ' 20s or early ' 30s so he was coming back from paris with no money at all. He was really recycling his old paintings, the ones that he felt not so confident or happy with, \" david strivay, director of the university of liège in belgium, tells euronews. Then in 2013, 81 years after the enchanted pose was last seen, researchers using x-ray imaging found one-fourth of it underneath another magritte work at the museum of modern art in new york. Other quarters of the painting, which depicts two nude women standing next to columns, were found in museums in sweden and england. Now, the final piece — the upper right corner — has been located under magritte's god is not a saint in brussels. \" little by little the puzzle has been completed, \" says the art curator at the english museum where the third piece was found. The enchanted pose will likely never be physically reunited as it would require the destruction of four other paintings, but reuters reports it has been \" virtually restored \" at brussels ' magritte museum. Atlas obscura reports there is a larger ongoing effort to find more potentially lost and hidden magritte works. ( there's a dead body hiding in an 1889 van gogh. )",

            "A rough guide to controversies surrounding the republican front-runner, from mafia ties to anti-trust violations to bankruptcy. The 2016 presidential election could be the most scandal-plagued match-up since james blaine's allegedly corrupt business deals squared off against grover cleveland's alleged illegitimate child in 1884. On the democratic side, hillary clinton is poised to win the nomination, bringing with her a train-car's worth of baggage. But the republican front-runner is at least as saddled with controversy as clinton is — and while many of the clinton cases involve suspicion and shadowy links, many of trump's are fully documented in court cases and legal proceedings. The breadth of trump's controversies is truly yuge, ranging from allegations of mafia ties to unscrupulous business dealings, and from racial discrimination to alleged marital rape. The stretch over more than four decades, from the mid-1970s to the present day. To catalogue the full sweep of allegations would require thousands of words and lump together the trivial with the truly scandalous. Including business deals that have simply failed, without any hint of impropriety, would require thousands more. This is a snapshot of some of the",

According to cnn, the employee was trying to fix a problem with the s3 billing system. S3 is part of amazon web services, which hosts hundreds of thousands of websites and apps. It reportedly has more than a million users and accounts for 40 % of the cloud services market. That's a lot of websites and apps. Anyway, the employee was trying to take a few servers offline to work on the billing issue but made a typo in the command and accidentally took a whole bunch of servers offline instead. The loss of s3 servers kept news sites from publishing stories and slack users from sharing files. More than half of the top 100 online retailers saw their websites slow by 20 % or more. The list of affected sites and apps included github, venmo, quora, medium, and giphy. The s3 service outage reportedly cost companies more than $ 150 million all told. The servers were down for nearly four hours. Engadget reports it took amazon \" longer than expected \" to get the problem fixed because it was the first time some servers had been restarted in \" many years. \" amazon says it's \" making several changes \" to avoid a repeat in the future.",

        "summary": "A surveillance device that \" tricks \" cellphones into revealing their location has been a civil rights concern since it debuted. Now, for the first time, a federal judge agrees that using such a tool to id a suspect's home without a warrant is an \" unreasonable \" violation of the man's rights, reuters reports. Us district judge william pauley ruled tuesday the dea shouldn't have used the \" stingray \" to find raymond lambis ' nyc apartment during a drug-trafficking probe and, therefore, that the narcotics and drug-related items found at his home can't be used as evidence. \" absent a search warrant, the government may not turn a citizen's cellphone into a tracking device, \" pauley wrote in his decision. The charge against lambis happened just before a september justice department mandate that now requires a warrant \" supported by probable cause before using a cell-site simulator, \" the new york times notes. The stingray mimics cellphone towers and fools phones into transmitting pings to the fake tower, allowing authorities to track where the pings are coming from. In lambis ' case, the dea had a warrant for numbers called from a phone suspected in the drug investigation, as well as for records of the cellphone towers that phone was hooking up to. But the agency went a step further and used the stingray, finding an apartment building ( and then lambis ' apartment ) where the pings were especially strong — a step not covered by the original warrant, which led pauley to insinuate the dea had simply been lazy in not acquiring a second warrant, the register notes. Lambis concedes he consented to the search of his bedroom, where the evidence was found, but he says in a court filing that's only because he didn't want his family's entire home \" trashed \" by a search if he didn't acquiesce, ars technica reports. \" a federal court has finally held the authorities to account, \" a move that \" strongly reinforces the strength of our constitutional privacy rights in the digital age, \" a staff lawyer for the aclu's speech, privacy, and technology project tells the times.

Stone had \" self-inflicted cutting wounds to the center of his body, \" and police found a knife nearby. He apparently committed suicide after yesterday's rampage in which he killed former wife nicole stone along with her mother, grandmother, sister, brother-in-law, and niece. The only survivor is a 17-year-old nephew who was seriously wounded. Victims were shot and slashed with a knife. Stone reportedly recorded a video on a phone found either on him or nearby, but police did not reveal its contents. Stone had been in a bitter custody dispute with his wife over their two daughters. He dropped the two girls off unharmed at a neighbor's house after shooting their mother, authorities say. Stone is a former marine, and a neighbor tells the philadelphia inquirer that he was a \" great guy and an excellent father \" in the early years of the marriage. \" and then he went away to iraq and came back and was a completely different man. \" the newspaper notes that among his facebook favorites was the national center for post traumatic stress disorder.",

        "summary": "It's another day of familiar violence in gaza and israel: after taking heavy criticism from the us and un over another shelling of a un school in gaza yesterday, israel put a seven-hour humanitarian truce into place today, reports the guardian. Palestinians, however, accused israel of breaking it less than an hour after it began with a bomb attack on a refugee camp, reports reuters. A spokesperson for the israeli military was checking into the report. Israel had exempted the area around rafah, but this strike occurred elsewhere, killing an 8-year-old girl and wounding about 20, say palestinians. Other developments: bus attack: israeli police say an attacker drove a construction excavator into a bus in jerusalem today and overturned the vehicle, reports the ap. Several people were reportedly injured, at least one seriously, and the attacker was shot and killed by police. Israel called it a terrorist attack. School strike under scrutiny: a new york times investigation of an israeli strike at a un school in jabaliya on wednesday suggests that israel used heavy artillery \" inappropriate for urban areas. \" the strike killed 21 people who were sheltering at the school, and the times says israel has offered no evidence that hamas militants were operating in the vicinity as a justification for the attack. No end in sight: israel has announced a scaling back of ground operations, leading to speculation that the entire military operation might be winding down. \" but it is by no means clear that an end to the fighting is in sight, \" writes bethany bell at the bbc. \" the offensive around rafah, near the egyptian border, continues, possibly to try and make it harder for hamas to re-arm in future. And the army may be searching for more cross border tunnels that it has not yet identified. \"",

Police say kenneth gleason, 23, has been charged only with drug offenses for now because they don't have enough evidence for a murder charge, but he remains a person of interest in the investigation, the advocate reports.

The killings took place about 5 miles apart, and police say they haven't uncovered any connection between the victims.

The cbc reports three metal balls — weighing a half-pound, 13 pounds, and about 99 pounds respectively — crash-landed in two vietnamese provinces over the weekend. One of the balls — the smallest, fortunately — landed on a roof. The others landed near a stream and in a garden. Witnesses claim to have heard something like thunder and then looked up to see the balls flying through the air. The mysterious spheres were seized by vietnam's air defense arms, and the ministry of defense is investigating. Initial investigations revealed the balls are \" specialized compressed air tanks, \" possibly from a rocket, the cbc reports. According to the bbc, they were made in russia but may have been in use by another country. Now that they failed to land on anyone, the balls appear harmless. One expert thinks they came from a failed satellite launch and fell less than 62 miles since they aren't broken, the cbc reports. Uproxx points out no publicly known satellite launches took place near the time and place the balls fell. \" it's not clear who in the region would even be launching such a rocket, \" the site adds. \" and if they were launching a rocket, where's the rest of it? \" a member of the vietnamese military says he ' ll be telling other countries to be more careful with their space balls in the future, the independent reports.

        "summary": "Can't get that last bit of lip balm out of the tube? scrape it out with your finger. That's basically what a federal appeals court told a california woman thursday when it dismissed her class-action lawsuit alleging fresh inc. Conned consumers into thinking there was more of its sugar lip treatment in the tube than they could actually access, courthouse news service reports. The us court of appeals for the 9th circuit rejected angela ebner's claim that the company tried to mislead consumers about the quantity of its pricey lip balm, which sells for roughly $ 24 a tube, per the ap. Ebner had insisted that the way the company packaged and dispensed the lip treatment was in violation of her state's consumer protection laws, reuters notes. To be more specific, ebner said that the lip balm tube employs a twist-up mechanism that allows only 75 % of the product to dispense beyond the tube opening. But the court noted that no state or federal laws were breached because the package labels accurately indicate just how much balm is in each tube. The court opinion stated, probably not to ebner's liking, that \" the reasonable consumer understands the general mechanics of these dispenser tubes \" and that \" it is up to the consumer to decide whether it is worth the effort to extract any remaining product with a finger or a small tool. \" ( why a \" lip balm to the stars \" was hit with a suit. )",

        "summary": "Dr. Autumn klein died of cyanide poisoning in 2013; her husband, dr. Robert ferrante, was convicted of her murder last month. Cyanide poisoning is rare, killing just seven people in the us in 2012 — which is why it's especially strange that five days after ferrante's conviction, another doctor at the hospital where klein worked also died of cyanide poisoning. Nicole kotchey, 35, was found unconscious near her desk at the university of pittsburgh medical center on the morning of nov. 12 and died less than four hours later, the pittsburgh post-gazette reports. Now, investigators are trying to determine whether her death was a homicide, a suicide, or an accident, the guardian reports. \" to have one — let alone two — is extraordinarily unusual, \" says the allegheny county chief medical examiner, who adds that he doesn't know why his office would perform such an obscure test for cyanide on kotchey, but assumes it was because of what happened to klein. In fact, klein's colleagues were initially stumped by her sudden and mysterious illness, which lasted three days before she died; they finally \" ordered everything including the kitchen sink, \" the medical examiner says, \" and the cyanide test was part of that kitchen sink. \" in her case, ferrante ordered the chemical and gave it to his wife in a drink he said would help her conceive, but investigators are stumped as to what happened to kotchey, a molecular biologist. It is possible to ingest, inhale, or absorb via skin a lethal amount of cyanide, but a molecular biology professor says people who work with cyanide are \" obviously very aware of its risks \" — and it's not even clear whether kotchey did work with cyanide. Cyanide purchases are scrutinized, the professor adds, so investigators are likely looking to see if anyone has purchased it recently. Click for more on klein's murder. ( one man who died of cyanide poisoning last year ate it in a courtroom after he was convicted of a sex offense. )",

The sunday times, citing a westminster source, says the clock is so dilapidated it may grind to a halt. Meanwhile, the daily mail on sunday suggested the clock's hands could fall off without urgent action.

        "summary": "As the nation focuses on the many issues dogging the obamacare website, the washington post points out another big affordable care act headache: the health co-ops — nonprofit insurance companies established by congress to increase competition and lower insurance costs — are floundering. One has shut down entirely and at least 10 more are in trouble; just 24 have even started selling insurance on the exchanges. Their failure could be a big problem for taxpayers, with the post projecting the co-ops could default on up to $ 1 billion in loans. The problem: facing opposition from insurance industry lobbyists, congress put all sorts of restrictions on the co-ops, among them tight loan repayment schedules, limitations on selling insurance to big companies, and a ban on using federal money for marketing purposes. Plus, funding was cut big-time. Oh, and those website problems? those are also hurting co-ops, which depend on the new health care exchanges for business. More obamacare news: two of those healthcare.gov problems will take even longer to fix than expected, the obama administration said yesterday. The administration initially said people would be able to electronically enroll in medicaid by nov. 1; now officials won't predict when that feature will be available, the washington post reports. And the spanish-language enrollment portion was supposed to work by this week; it's still not functioning. The administration has enlisted jeffrey zients, the former acting director of the white house budget office, to oversee the website fixes, cbs news reports. He has experience in business management, and jay carney says better management is exactly what is needed. Lawmakers are pushing the white house to delay the individual mandate until the website works, and though the administration is still determined not to do that, the washington times reports that they've left themselves \" wiggle room \" if a delay ends up being necessary. Carney wouldn't rule out a delay, and analysts say kathleen sebelius can waive fines and penalties with a \" blanket exemption \" as a last resort. Meanwhile, the administration is appealing to its allies to keep supporting obamacare, the ap reports. Even supporters ( think nancy pelosi and steny hoyer ) have complained about the website issues, and one democratic senator is among those calling for a delay of the individual mandate.",

Saturday's collapse at the glacier presbyterian camp left two people in critical condition, and left many more to wonder whether the 10-foot-high deck buckled from the weight of too many people or if there was another reason it failed, the ap reports. Determining the cause of the collapse will be up to the resort's insurer, lake county sheriff don bell says. \" it was not a crime, so we won't be investigating it, ' he says. \" it ' ll be handled between the property owner and the people who got injured yesterday. \" the injured were taken by ambulance and helicopters to five hospitals — the nearest one 30 miles away — while others drove themselves to be treated for broken bones, scrapes, and bruises. Officials for the kalispell regional medical center say that there were a number of orthopedic and neurological injuries that required immediate surgery. One critically injured person was transported to a hospital in seattle. The people injured ranged from 3 years old to older than 80, lakeside/somers fire chief tom havens says. The flathead beacon reports that out of dozens of people hospitalized in kalispell saturday, the nine remaining patients monday were all in good condition.",
