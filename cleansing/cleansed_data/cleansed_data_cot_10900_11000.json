After a six-year legal battle, a swiss court has ordered the billionaire to give half his fortune, roughly $ 4.5 billion, to his ex-wife elena, reports the bbc. One of her lawyers described the settlement as \" the most expensive divorce in history. \" rybolovlev, who made his fortune in the fertilizer industry, is ranked 147th on the forbes rich list. Elena was also awarded custody of the couple's other daughter, 13-year-old anna. The couple, both 47 years old, were married for 23 years and the court decided that she was entitled to half the money he made during that time, much of which was transferred into offshore trusts. Elena's lawyers say the ruling shows \" no one — not even a russian tycoon who put his fabulous fortune into legal structures such as trusts and offshore companies — is above the law, \" the ap reports.",

Thirty states and the district of columbia prohibit texting while driving, and eight of them, plus d.c., also require hands-free devices for use with cell phones. But in four states that the hldi examined — california, louisiana, minnesota, and washington — passage of texting bans did not seem to reduce the rate of accidents. In slate, james ledbetter took issue with the study. He pointed out that researchers hadn't taken into account the huge rise in texting; even if the texting bans didn't reduce accidents, they may well be keeping accident rates steady, because even more people would be fiddling with their phones if we didn't have these laws.

        "summary": "A new study published last week finds that one in eight american adults qualifies as having a drinking disorder. According to the study published in jama psychiatry, the rate of alcohol use disorder in the country rose nearly 50 % from 2001 to 2013, the washington post reports. Currently, 12.7 % of americans meet the criteria for an alcohol use disorder, which include whether booze interferes with individuals ' jobs or family life and whether they struggle to stop.the 12.7 % includes people who suffer from alcohol abuse and less severe alcohol dependence. The report's authors describe the results as a \" public health crisis \" that mirrors an increase in diseases and injuries \" in which alcohol use has a substantial role, \" including cirrhosis and hypertension. The cdc estimates that excessive alcohol use leads to 88,000 american deaths a year. Alcohol use disorders increased across the board but have hit certain groups harder than others, cnn reports. Among african-americans the number increased nearly 93 %, while disorders increased 84 % among women. The group that saw the biggest jump, however, was senior citizens. There was a 106.7 % increase in alcohol use disorders among people 65 and older. Researchers suggest the \" generally much greater \" increase of disorders among minorities could stem from growing economic inequality between whites and minorities, increasing \" stress and demoralization, \" npr reports.",

The topographical features of mars, named after the roman god of war, for instance, carry latin names like \" mons \" for mountain and \" planitia \" for plain. In half a century, the union has named only a thousand of the estimated half-a-million craters on mars — each decided in a cautious vetting process. Large",
            "A fundraising campaign that lets internet users give unofficial names to craters on mars has triggered an angry exchange with the group that gives the official names to such features — the international astronomical union. The crater-naming campaign is the latest controversy to pit the iau against uwingu, a commercial venture that raises money for science and education through celestial name games. Uwingu's mars project, unveiled last month, lets players nickname the estimated 500,000 martian craters that have not yet been labeled. The cost ranges from $ 5 to $ 5,000, depending on the size of the crater. Uwingu makes clear that the names carry no official sanction — nevertheless, the idea of taking in money for placing names on a map irked the iau. \" such initiatives go against the spirit of free and equal access to space, as well as against internationally recognized standards, \" the iau said tuesday in a statement. \" hence no purchased names can ever be used on official maps and globes. \"'self-licking ice cream cone'the statement prompted an equally strong-worded response from uwingu co-founder doug griffith, a lawyer specializing in aviation and spaceflight issues. \" the iau needs to stop being the self-licking ice cream cone of the scientific community, and recognize that as long as its existence is merely to gratify its own puritanical principles and sense of elitism"

The bbc reports on xiao jianhua, who was reported missing over the weekend and has been the subject of conflicting reports since. A family member retracted the missing-persons reports on sunday, telling hong kong police xiao ( at that point not yet identified to the public ) had turned up \" safe. \" and even though hong kong cops confirmed that xiao — in his mid-40s and linked to helping the ruling class with their banking — had entered the chinese mainland on friday, the day he vanished, cryptic statements posted on social media by xiao's company alleged he was getting medical treatment \" abroad \" ( translation: not in china, per the new york times ), that he was a patriot, and that he hadn't been abducted. The mystery deepened when the statements suddenly vanished this week, as did the company's online presence. The guardian cites reports that say xiao — a canadian citizen and permanent hong kong resident, per the south china morning post — was taken from his four seasons apartment by plainclothes cops and may have been swept up as part of the government's anti-corruption campaign; a person close to xiao confirms to the times the financier is in chinese police custody. The bbc speculates xiao may also be suspected of opposing president xi jinping. Either way, a kidnapping would violate the agreement between hong kong and china that only hong kong cops have jurisdiction in the territory. A similar incident happened in 2015, when five hong kong booksellers vanished and turned up on the mainland in police custody. ( more on xiao's background in the financial times. )",

The school's board of trustees emailed the announcement to campus fraternities today, saying women must become full members and leaders in the organizations, business insider reports. The mandate follows a period of \" heightened discussion \" about the dangers of fraternity life at wesleyan, which has a pretty campus for 30,000 students in central connecticut, the wall street journal notes. A former student claimed in a lawsuit that she had been raped at a wesleyan fraternity party in 2010 and said the frat house — the mu epsilon chapter of beta theta pi — was commonly called the \" rape factory \" on campus, the hartford courant reported at the time. Wesleyan then closed beta theta pi a few weeks ago after a female student was critically injured falling from a third-story window at a party, nbc news reports. What's more, the school has \" butted heads with beta \" over whether wesleyan can manage the chapter house and police its parties, notes an old buzzfeed article. \" six years of hearing about high-risk drinking at fraternities and dealing with fallout from highly publicized incidents of sexual violence have had an effect, \" wesleyan president michael roth wrote on the school's website this year. So will the co-ed mandate take hold? beta \" is working to better understand \" it, the frat house said in a statement, but still believes in places \" for young men to come together and forge the bonds of fraternal brotherhood \" on campus.

The shura council, which normally does not legislate, held legislative powers under morsi's presidency because the lower house had been dissolved. State tv reported adli mansour's constitutional decree dissolving the body but did not give further details. Mansour also named the head of general intelligence, rafaat shehata, as his security adviser. The african union suspended egypt from membership in the continental body. Au commission head nkosazana dlamini-zuma told a news conference in the ethiopian capital, addis ababa, that morsi's ouster falls under the au doctrine on unconstitutional changes of government. Au officials decided today to block egypt from all activities of the continental body until constitutional order is restored in the nation, she said. In america, a photo of john kerry on his yacht as the coup roared wednesday is creating quite an uproar, gawker reports. The state department initially denied kerry was on his boat, then admitted he was, albeit \" briefly. \" ten people have been killed in clashes so far.",

According to nbc news, the district attorney says \" we may never know \" why dinardo and kratz — both 20 — allegedly killed the four men, though all four deaths appear tied to drug deals. Dinardo, who confessed to the murders thursday in exchange for avoiding the death penalty, says he was going to sell jimi patrick, 19, four pounds of marijuana for $ 8,000 on july 5. He says patrick only had $ 800 so he offered to sell him a shotgun instead; then he shot him. Dinardo says he and kratz agreed to rob dean finocchiaro, 19, during a similar drug deal july 7. He says kratz shot finocchiaro during the robbery. ( wpvi reports the major difference between statements by dinardo and kratz is that kratz claims dinardo shot finocchiaro and he never shot anyone. ) dinardo told police he shot the other two victims — thomas meo, 21, and mark sturgis, 22 — during a second drug-deal-turned-robbery july 7. With help from dinardo, police found the four bodies on property belonging to dinardo's family. Authorities say dinardo had attempted to burn three of the bodies in a metal container he called \" the pig roaster. \" prosecutors say dinardo has been diagnosed as schizophrenic.

        "summary": "About one in five americans say they've peed in the pool. Even the world's most famous pool-user, michael phelps, says \" everybody \" does it. Now scientists have finally figured out a way to quantify just how much urine is in our pools, and the results in environmental science &amp; technology letters probably won't please swimmers. A research team testing 31 pools and hot tubs in canada found evidence of urine in every single one of them, gizmodo reports. On average, there were 8 gallons of urine in a 110,000-gallon pool and 18.5 gallons of urine in a 220,000-gallon pool. According to the guardian, the results were even grosser for hot tubs. One hotel hot tub was found to have three times the urine level of the worst swimming pool. Researchers figured this all out by measuring the levels of acesulfame potassium, or ace-k, in pools and hot tubs, npr reports. Ace-k is an artificial sweetener found in soup, diet soda, candy, yogurt, and much more. It doesn't occur in nature and 95 % of it passes straight through the body unchanged, making it a good indicator of urine levels in water. While urine itself isn't harmful, it can react with chlorine to create \" disinfectant byproducts, \" which can be. Still, researchers say they aren't trying to turn people off of swimming; they'd just like to remind everyone to please not pee in the pool. ( that classic summertime pool smell? it's pee. )",

But up until now, just how much urine has been difficult to measure, says chemist xing-fang li of the university of alberta. Li and her colleagues report they can now tell roughly how much pee is in a pool by measuring the artificial sweeteners carried in most people's urine. Certain sweeteners can be a good proxy for pee, she says, because they're designed to \" go right through you \" and don't break down readily in pool water. The scientists calculated that one 220,000-gallon, commercial-size swimming pool contained almost 20 gallons of urine. In a residential pool ( 20-by-40-foot, five-feet deep ), that would translate to about two gallons of pee. It's only about one-hundredth of a percent, but any urine in a swimming pool can be a health concern for some people, not to mention that smell that never quite goes away. Li's team collected water from pools and hot tubs at hotels and recreation facilities in two canadian",
            "Pools are giant toilets. Around one in five americans admit to having peed in a swimming pools at least once. Every pool probably contains a shot glass full of urine per swimmer, according to a story by chemical and engineering news from last year. The people around you might not know you peed. But thanks to the artificial sweeteners you eat, science knows. Science always knows. Advertisement sure, people think pee is sterile ( it's not ), but its chemicals can react with the pool water to form so-called \"disinfectant byproducts, \" or dbps. Some of these chemicals can even be toxic, but that c&en story reports that we don't know if swimmers are exposed to enough dbp in pools to cause health effects. Regardless, it would be nice to know how much pee was in the pool so more people don't pee in it. According to a recent study in environmental science and technology letters, the answer might be in the artificial sweeteners you eat. A team of researchers looked at one common sweetener in particular, called acesulfame-potassium, or ace-k. People eat lots of ace-k, because it shows up in diet sodas, candy, jell-o, and plenty of other products, wrote bill chameides, a duke university professor emeritus.

Li and her colleagues report they can now tell roughly how much pee is in a pool by measuring the artificial sweeteners carried in most people's urine. Certain sweeteners can be a good proxy for pee, she says, because they're designed to \" go right through you \" and don't break down readily in pool water. The scientists calculated that one 220,000-gallon, commercial-size swimming pool contained almost 20 gallons of urine. In a residential pool ( 20-by-40-foot, five-feet deep ), that would translate to about two gallons of pee. It's only about one-hundredth of a percent, but any urine in a swimming pool can be a health concern for some people, not to mention that smell that never quite goes away. Li's team collected water from pools and hot tubs at hotels and recreation facilities in two canadian",
            "Pools are giant toilets. Around one in five americans admit to having peed in a swimming pools at least once. Every pool probably contains a shot glass full of urine per swimmer, according to a story by chemical and engineering news from last year. The people around you might not know you peed. But thanks to the artificial sweeteners you eat, science knows. Science always knows. Advertisement sure, people think pee is sterile ( it's not ), but its chemicals can react with the pool water to form so-called \"disinfectant byproducts, \" or dbps. Some of these chemicals can even be toxic, but that c&en story reports that we don't know if swimmers are exposed to enough dbp in pools to cause health effects. Regardless, it would be nice to know how much pee was in the pool so more people don't pee in it. According to a recent study in environmental science and technology letters, the answer might be in the artificial sweeteners you eat. A team of researchers looked at one common sweetener in particular, called acesulfame-potassium, or ace-k. People eat lots of ace-k, because it shows up in diet sodas, candy, jell-o, and plenty of other products, wrote bill chameides, a duke university professor emeritus. Even better, almost all the ace-k you eat"

        "summary": "Get ready to hear much more about a powerful new street drug called w-18. Police in edmonton, canada, this week announced a huge seizure of it made in december — 4 kilograms, or enough for hundreds of millions of pills, reports the globe and mail. The drug is a synthetic opiate like fentanyl that produces a heroin-like high, but it's 100 times more powerful than fentanyl and 10,000 times more powerful than morphine. As vice and the cbc explain, it's probably being churned out by labs in china and then shipped to north america via services such as fedex. This is the second major w-18 seizure within a year in canada, but it's not just a canadian problem. A drug dealer in florida convicted of importing fentanyl also had 2.5 pounds of w-18, the sun sentinel reported in march. But because the drug isn't illegal — yet — it didn't factor into his sentence. \" this is the most deadly drug trend i've seen in 31 years, \" says an epidemiologist at nova southeastern university in florida. Scientists at the university of alberta developed w-18 in the 1980s as a potential painkiller, though it and other strains in the \" w \" series, which ran from w-1 to w-32, have since been used mainly for research. The cbc notes w-18 is the most powerful of the 32. No tests are available to detect it in urine or blood, which means it may already be taking an unknown toll on users if it's being cut into other drugs — and perhaps be at least partly responsible for the escalating deaths attributed to heroin. \" often, if the analog is mixed with heroin, heroin just becomes the cause of death, \" an expert on synthetic drugs in florida tells the broward-palm beach new times.

In 2003, pennsylvania's joan langbord says she found 10 \" double eagle \" coins from 1933 in a safe-deposit box that once belonged to her father, jeweler israel switt. The rare coins are worth up to $ 10 million each, per the washington post, but there was one big problem: they'd allegedly been smuggled out of the philadelphia mint decades earlier. After langbord sent the coins for authentication in 2004, the government refused to return them, claiming the coins as its rightful property. In a 9-3 decision on monday, a federal appeals court sided with the government. \" switt knew that the 1933 double eagles were embezzled or stolen and that it was illegal to possess them, \" a judge said, per courthouse news. Some 445,500 double eagles — with lady liberty on the front and an eagle on the back — were struck at the philadelphia mint in 1933 with a face value of $ 20, but most were melted into gold bars when franklin roosevelt abandoned the gold standard. Two were sent to the smithsonian, but a rare few found their way to collectors, allegedly with the help of a cashier at the mint. Monday's ruling \" properly establishes that the united states is the lawful owner of the 1933 double eagle gold coins, \" says a us attorney. The decision backs up a 2012 court ruling, overturned in 2015 when an appeals court found the government missed a deadline to respond to langbord's claim. The panel on monday found that deadline didn't apply. A lawyer says langbord will appeal to the supreme court, per reuters. ( a hiker found this incredibly rare coin. )",

The spiders tend to be semi-aquatic, meaning they can often walk on water or swim. While the fish they eat tend to be on the smaller end, from 0.8 to 2.4 inches long, that's still on average 2.2 times the length of the spiders themselves, and the arachnids are capable of hunting fish up to 4.5 times their weight, reports the christian science monitor. One small spider, the argyroneta aquatica, actually lives underwater. Another, the ancylometes rufus, can dive under water for a whopping 20 minutes. Others hunt from above water, using their hind legs to cling to nearby plants or rocks. But most drag their prey to land soon after capture, with mouths big and strong enough to bite into the fish and inject paralyzing venom and enzymes that dissolve the fish into a more edible state. Spiders, it turns out, \" have evolved very potent neurotoxins [ for ] killing fish within seconds to minutes, \" one researcher tells usa today. The monitor points out spiders have also been observed dining on frogs, bats, mice, snakes, and even small birds. ( click to read about deadly spiders hatching out of grocery store bananas. )",

Five lead tablets buried in the grave of a young greek woman about 2,400 years ago bear curses against four tavern-keepers in athens, livescience reports. Apparently, burying the tablets was thought to put the curses closer to gods who could fulfill them. \" cast your hate upon phanagora and demetrios and their tavern and their property and their possessions, \" reads one, against a husband-and-wife pair of tavern owners. The curse-writer then threatens to put demetrios \" in such a bind... As strong as possible, \" and \" smite down a kynotos on [ your ] tongue. \" now jessica lamont, who teaches at john hopkins university, has written about the 2003 find in an academic journal — and casts light on the phrase \" kynotos on [ your ] tongue. \" meaning \" dog's ear, \" the kynotos was used in gambling as \" the name for the lowest possible throw of dice, \" says lamont. \" by striking demetrios'tongue with this condemningly unlucky roll, the curse reveals that local taverns were not just sociable watering holes, but venues ripe for gambling and other unsavory activities in classical athens. \" lamont says someone \" in the world of the tavern \" may have hired a professional curse-writer to place the tablets — which are pierced by an iron nail — into the grave so that \" chthonic \" ( or underworld ) gods would act on them. A 1,700-year-old lead curse tablet found in a roman mansion in jerusalem is no less ominous: \" i strike and strike down and nail down the tongue, the eyes, the wrath, the ire, the anger, the procrastination, the opposition of [ curse target ] iennys, \" it reads, per a 2013 article in discovery.",

The water mass of the large tank would not have posed any stability problems and could have housed live fish, such as sea bass or sea bream. This diagram shows how the hydraulic system might have worked. The researchers calculated that the small trade vessel could have carried a tank containing around 4 cubic meters ( 141 cubic feet ) of water, which could have housed 440 pounds of live fish. Connected to the lead pipe, the hand-operated piston pump would have easily allowed the necessary exchange of the water mass. According to the researchers, the water would have needed to be replaced once every half an hour in order to provide a constant oxygen supply. With a flow of 66 gallons per minute, the piston pump would have filled the tank in 16 minutes.

            "First, a prosecutor would need to appeal to – perhaps exploit – stone's natural sense of self-preservation. For all the trouble he has been mixed up in over his long career, stone has never been at any real risk of serving time behind bars. Friday's indictment might change his bearing a bit. It's one thing to rail publicly against the possibility of a theoretical future indictment, but another to see seven federal criminal charges, carrying a total maximum sentence of 50 years, in black and white. As a practical matter, stone isn't looking at anything close to 50 years, but he easily could be facing five years or so if convicted on all counts. For a 66 year-old man like stone, that could mean most or all of the rest of his life, which has to be at least a bit sobering. And the evidence laid out in the indictment seems locked in; over and over again, the indictment quotes stone's lies and then cites hard proof – typically stone's own texts – to prove that he lied. A good prosecutor could make a compelling case that cooperation offers stone his best and most realistic chance to get through the case without having to serve time. Second, as much as we don't like to acknowledge it in our quest for pure justice, money matters. It is expensive to defend yourself in federal court, and it is jaw-droppingly costly to go to trial. Stone has flashed vulnerability on this, declaring that he faces legal fees of $ 2 million – not an outrageous estimate, if a trial is involved – while noting that he is \"not a wealthy man \" and begging for crowdfunded donations. Third, stone is nothing if not ego-driven. We all are, of course, but stone's in his own league. A prosecutor might therefore make a pitch to stone along these lines. You can stay quiet, you can be a \"stand-up \" guy, you can fight the government and maybe even go to trial. Trump will send nice tweets about you, you ' ll have a heavy media following for a couple years, but ultimately you ' ll be a strange footnote in history. Or you can flip and be john dean.",

        "summary": "It's well-known that men drink more than women — but a new analysis by a national institutes of health group finds that the gap between the way the two genders consume alcohol in the us is narrowing, according to an nih press release. For example, the percentage of females who drank alcohol in the previous 30 days went from 44.9 % in 2002 to 48.3 % in 2012, while the percentage of males went from 57.4 % to 56.1 % during the same time period. Similarly, the average number of drinking days during the prior month went from 6.8 to 7.3 days for females, while going from 9.9 to 9.5 days for males. \" males still consume more alcohol, but the differences between men and women are diminishing, \" says the lead researcher. The analysis looked at data from annual national surveys from 2002 to 2012. Researchers looked at \" lifetime abstinence, age of onset, current drinking, binge drinking, drinking and driving, reaching... Criteria for an alcohol use disorder, combining alcohol with other drugs such as marijuana, and other variables, \" and found that the gap between males and females narrowed, for all age groups or at least one age group, in all but one area: combining alcohol with pot \" during the last drinking occasion. \" that behavior increased from 15 % to 19 % among males aged 18 to 25, but held steady at about 10 % for females of the same age.

You're finally going to be happy in heaven. \" to a friend: \" [ roy's ] death was my fault. Like, honestly i could have stopped it.

It was caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, \" he said per tweets from boston herald reporter bob mcgovern. The prosecution has painted carter, now 20, as an attention-seeker who wanted to be the \" grieving girlfriend. \" ( this case recalls an 1816 trial in the state. )",

According to the indictment, fedex even set up a special \" online pharmacy credit policy \" to ensure it kept getting paid if law enforcement shut these businesses down. \" many of these companies operate outside federal and state regulations over the sale of controlled drugs, \" the company told its managers in a memo explaining the policy. Prosecutors say fedex also knew that it was delivering to addicts — some of whom would allegedly stop trucks on the road to demand their pills, bloomberg reports. In one case, when a customer's license was suspended, fedex allegedly told it that service could continue, as long as the pharmacy increased its payments. If convicted, fedex faces at least $ 1.6 billion in fines — or about twice the $ 820 million it allegedly made shipping the drugs.

        "summary": "\" it's worse than we thought 10 years ago, \" a researcher says following a \" landmark \" study on the world's primates that found many could go extinct in the next 50 years. Primatologists studied every primate species — all 504 of them — and found 75 % are in decline, while about 60 % are threatened with extinction, including every species of ape and 87 % of lemurs, reports the new york times. What's imperiling them: hunting ( for food and body parts ), mining ( the search for coltan, an ore used in cellphones, is one factor ), and deforestation ( our appetite for palm oil is particularly troublesome ). The guardian reports deforestation is the biggest factor of the three: from 1990 to 2010, 580,000 square miles of primate habitats — an area more than twice the size of texas — was destroyed due to agricultural growth. \" the scale of this is massive, \" a researcher tells the guardian, adding he was \" horrified \" by the report. \" the world will soon be facing a major extinction event if effective action is not implemented immediately, \" reads the study, published wednesday in science advances. New scientist suggests conservation efforts could zero in on four key countries, which host two-thirds of our primate species: brazil, indonesia, democratic republic of the congo, and madagascar, which is down to the last 2,000 of its famed ring-tailed lemurs. Building fish farms in areas where hunting is common and protecting primate habitats might safeguard primates ' roles in the ecosystem, including moving pollen from tree to tree and spreading seeds through their dung, researchers say. This could be our \" one last opportunity. \" ( extinct animals can be found in an \" ark \" in a freezer. )",

In an interview with si.com, mancuso said she and the rest of the alpine skiing team were tired of the media lust for the photogenic vonn. \" people are having a hard time reaching their potential because it's such a struggle for attention, \" she said. \" you come to meetings after races and it's like it's a bad day if lindsey didn't do well. \" vonn responded today that \" it definitely has hurt me that she said some negative things, \" reports the seattle times. \" all i can do is continue to support her like i always have been and hope that she reciprocates that. \" this won't help: when mancuso took off on her slalom run today, she was on a first-place pace. Officials made her stop and start again — under deteriorating conditions — because vonn had crashed ahead of her. She's now well behind the leaders.",

            "Scientists create new robotic terminator-style muscle 1,000 times stronger than humans by travis gettys thursday, december 26, 2013 11: 25 edt researchers have developed a tiny robotic muscle that's 1,000 time stronger than a human muscle. The team of researchers at the university of california-berkeley found that vanadium dioxide changes from an insulator to a conductive metal at about 152 degrees, which produced a huge amount of strength during the transition. The scientists used the material to demonstrate a microchip-sized, twisting robotic motor that could catapult objects 50 times heavier than itself over a distance five times longer than itself faster than the blink of an eye – within 60 milliseconds. The team fabricated the micro-muscle from a long v-shaped ribbon made of chromium and vanadium dioxide, which is already prized for its ability to change size, shape and physical identity, and heated it with a tiny pad or by electrical current. When the dual coil formed by the ribbon is heated, said physicist junqiao wu, who led the team, it turns into either a tiny catapult or a proximity sensor, which causes a rapid change in the muscle's resistance and shape that pushes away nearby objects. \"multiple micro-muscles can be assembled into a micro-robotic system that simulates an active neuromuscular system, \" wu said. \"the naturally combined functions of proximity sensing and torsional motion allow the",

Women, after all, are not yet able to become priests, and it is unlikely that traditionalists in the church will suddenly upend the all-male, celibate priesthood, let alone name a woman as the bishop of rome. Nonetheless, handing leadership to a woman — and in particular, to a nun — would vastly strengthen catholicism, help the church solve some of its immediate problems and inspire many who have left the church"

Per the report, intelligence reports and defector statements suggest north korea possesses 13 biological pathogens including anthrax, cholera, smallpox, and the plague, and may have the capability to cultivate and weaponize them in as few as 10 days. Just \" a few kilograms of anthrax, equivalent to a few bottles of wine \" could wipe out half a city's population, notes the report, which posits potential delivery methods: everything from putting pathogens into a city's water supply to employing \" sleeper agents \" posing as cleaning and disinfection workers equipped with backpack sprayers — with south korea's people and the american troops there within reach.

North korea reacted harshly. This was evidence of america's plan to use weapons of mass destruction against their people, pyongyang claimed in its demand for an emergency united nations meeting. The north koreans also resurfaced a propagandistic, ahistorical charge that american forces had already once used biological weapons against them, during the korean war in the 1950s, when outbreaks of typhoid, cholera and smallpox gripped the nation. Ten days after the pentagon notice, north korean dictator kim jong un toured the newly minted pyongyang bio-technical institute, posing before cameras in front of a suspiciously large pesticide production facility that analysts say has the potential to produce anthrax on a massive military scale. In fact, experts warn that north korea's biological weapons could wreak as much havoc as its nuclear bombs — and are already fully developed and ready to deploy. President trump is in the midst of a multi-country tour of asia, with the north korean nuclear program atop the agenda.

Since then, ian burkhart has been living in his father and stepmother's columbus, ohio-area basement, where he's able to feed himself using his shoulders and elbows, which he still has some use of — after a family member affixes a fork to his powerless hand. In a bid to ease such reliance, in april burkhart let doctors open his skull, implant a chip in his brain's motor cortex, and run a wire from it to a small metal cylinder that was fastened to his bone using screws. Then came the practice: roughly every other day since then he's worked with scientists from battelle, a nonprofit research group, observing a digital hand moving across a screen and thinking hard about imitating the motion. Battelle's technology, dubbed neurobridge, allows a brain signal to bypass burkhart's injured spinal cord and, in a tenth of a second, go directly to an electrode-packed sleeve on his arm, cnet explains. Last week came the big try: a gray computer cord was connected to the metal cylinder, his right forearm was encircled that sleeve, and burkhart imagined opening and closing his hand — a movement that could one day allow him to feed himself. The hand opened ( not fully ), then closed, an action he repeated over and over. And then he managed to grab and hold a spoon... For a moment.

        "summary": "A former soviet officer by the name of stanislav petrov has died, and the key point surfacing in obituaries about him is a pretty remarkable one: his poise under pressure may have saved the world from a nuclear war. As usa today and the new york times report, petrov was the officer in charge at a command center near moscow on sept. 26, 1983, when the unthinkable happened: alarms went off as the facility's computers warned that the us had launched five icbms toward the soviet union. All eyes turned to lt. Col. Petrov as he assessed the situation. If he called his superiors to report an imminent attack, a counter-strike would be likely in those tense days of the cold war. \" all i had to do was to reach for the phone, to raise the direct line to our top commanders — but i couldn't move, \" he told the bbc in 2013. \" i felt like i was sitting on a hot frying pan. \" petrov then went with his instinct: he called it a false alarm, though he would say later that he figured it was a 50-50 chance. \" i had a funny feeling in my gut, \" he once told the washington post. In those crucial minutes, things hadn't added up: for instance, why would the us launch an attack with only five missiles? petrov turned out to be correct, of course.

        "summary": "Former mob boss thomas \" tommy shots \" gioeli wants $ 10 million from the federal government over a ping-pong injury. Gioeli, once a high-ranking member of the colombo crime family, is suing over an injury he suffered during a game at the metropolitan detention center in brooklyn in 2013, according to court papers seen by the new york daily news. He says he slipped on a wet floor while playing a game and fractured a kneecap. His suit argues that the prison is negligent because employees ignored complaints about a leaky pipe that led to the slippery conditions in the recreation area. The federal government, however, says that even ping-pong comes with risks, and gioeli chose to take them. Gioeli needed surgery and rehab after the fall. The 64-year-old is three years into an 18-year sentence on racketeering charges, though he was acquitted of murder charges that included the 1997 slaying of a new york city police officer. At his sentencing in 2014, his attorney argued unsuccessfully for a light sentence because his client suffered from arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease, and thus probably wouldn't live beyond his early 70s, the new york times reported. The story also noted that gioeli had become a colorful fan of twitter, with tweets such as: \" the fbi spends it's limited resources on terminal italian book-makers while terrorist &amp; cartels flourish. \" so how did gioeli wind up in prison? his own cousin ratted him out, reported the new york post.

Police are piecing together a portrait of the victim and the crime, and the picture that's emerging is a complex one. The latest, per the new york post and new york times: the victim, brandon lincoln woodard, 31, was known as a club promoter who liked to party and who had 20 arrests on his record, some of them drug-related... But he also happened to be in law school at the university of west los angeles, and had an upcoming final. He flew to nyc on a one-way ticket sunday, and reportedly planned to fly back to la on monday; he had asked his mother to pick him up from the airport at 8pm et... But he left his bag at the front desk when he exited the hotel just after 1pm, apparently intending to return. Police commissioner raymond kelly says woodard had three phones with him; one in his bag and two on him. Hours before his death, woodard \" looked scared and afraid of something \" while eating breakfast at a nearby diner, the cashier recalls. \" he was always looking over his shoulder \" while eating. Surveillance video shows the killer waited for him for 20 minutes outside his hotel. When woodard finally exited, he appears to have looked at the hooded shooter before turning around and continuing to text. The assailant shot him in the head from close behind before being whisked away by a getaway driver. Kelly says it's possible woodard was lured out of his hotel. Police don't think the couple who rented the getaway car were involved, though they may have loaned the car to someone who was. The gun had also been used in an unsolved 2009 shooting in queens.",

The daily progress reports that 33-year-old alex michael ramos turned himself in to the monroe county sheriff's office on monday night and was charged with malicious wounding after the assault of charlottesville resident deandre harris, a 20-year-old special education assistant. Video of the aug. 12 incident that's gone viral shows harris being beaten by a group of men who'd attended the white nationalist rally in emancipation park. Harris ' attorney says the assault started when harris, who went to the rally to protest the white nationalist groups, stepped in to help a friend who'd gotten into an argument with a white supremacist. The new york times notes harris was attacked with wooden boards and pipes. On his gofundme page, which drew more than $ 165,000, harris detailed the incident and his injuries, which included a concussion and an ulnar fracture. Ramos spoke with cbs46 before he turned himself in, noting he was \" absolutely not \" a white supremacist ( he says he's a puerto rican conservative who went to support free speech ), that harris was \" attacking and taunting \" people, and that he hit harris \" one time \" and wasn't part of the beating with \" sticks and shields. \" he also casts blame on local cops, saying in a video that police shouldn't have forced white nationalists into the streets with counterprotesters.

        "summary": "Police investigating friday's mass shooting in munich have identified the gunman who killed nine people before shooting himself as a german-iranian 18-year-old with no criminal record or known links to extremists. Police say the teen — named in some reports as ali sonboly — hacked a young woman's facebook account to lure people to a mcdonald's opposite a mall, promising a free giveaway of something \" not too expensive, \" the ap reports. In other developments: munich police chief hubertus andrae says the teen's motive, at this point, remains \" completely unclear \" and a search of his home hasn't revealed links to isis or any other terror group. He says the teen grew up in munich and there is \" absolutely no \" link between the shooting and the recent influx of refugees. Police say they have found evidence that the teen was obsessed with mass shootings, including a book called \" rampage in head: why students kill. \" he is also believed to have been obsessed with norwegian mass killer hans anders breivik and may have timed his attack to coincide with the fifth anniversary of breivik's rampage. The teen was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound hours after he opened fire at the mcdonald's and then moved to the crowded mall, the telegraph reports. Transport was shut down and people were ordered to stay in their homes for hours before police concluded the teen had acted alone. He was found with a 9mm glock pistol and 300 rounds of ammo, police say. Video has surfaced of the gunman on the roof of a parking lot being shouted at by another man on a balcony. \" i am german, \" the gunman shouts at one point as the man on the balcony swears at him. \" your head isn't on right, \" the bystander shouts, according to the guardian's translation. Authorities say all nine victims were munich residents. Seven of them were teenagers. A 20-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman were also killed. Three victims were ethnic albanians originally from kosovo, where president hashim thaci has declared sunday a day of mourning.",

Joël aubin was already experiencing severe symptoms by the time he was 36 years old, but wasn't diagnosed for another 18 months. His susceptibility is due to a genetic mutation that also caused his mother's death from the same disease at age 47. \" jo's teenage world had been ripped from its frame then, but he had grown up with no idea that he had a 50/50 chance of inheriting the same fate, \" reporter shannon proudfoot writes. A genetic mutation is usually the cause of early-onset alzheimer's, according to the national institute on aging. Aubin's wife, robin, watched as her once thoughtful husband became increasingly disoriented, forgetful, and detached. He was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and put on medication — but little changed. After an ultimatum from robin, he saw a specialist and was finally diagnosed with alzheimer's. Although devastated, robin also felt relief. \" we can name it, we can deal with it, \" she recalls thinking. More tests and medication followed, along with opportunities for experimental drugs that may slow the disease's progression. As for aubin himself, proudfoot writes that he has difficulty expressing himself in detail, but he recalls that \" the first time that i realized was shocking. \" he adds: \" it was like i don't know who i am, i don't know what i ' m saying.

The 52-year-old pleaded guilty in a jacksonville courtroom monday to abducting baby kamiyah mobley, now known as alexis manigo, the florida times-union reports. Williams, who raised the girl as her own in walterboro, sc, was arrested early last year after a tip to authorities, and manigo was matched to her birth parents through dna analysis. Under a plea deal, williams will not be covered by the four- to seven-year sentencing range in place at the time of the july 1998 kidnapping, but by the zero-to-life range introduced a few months afterward. Under the deal, williams, who disguised herself in a nurse's smock to snatch kamiyah when the baby was just eight hours old, will get between zero and 22 years in prison at a may sentencing hearing. Reuters reports that manigo — who learned the truth a few years before williams ' arrest and has remained close to her — has said she hopes the woman who raised her gets less than 10 years in prison. Manigo and the birth parents she was reunited with last year weren't present at monday's hearing, but they're expected to take part in the sentencing phase, which begins may 3. Soon after the arrest, manigo said williams, who reportedly kidnapped her after having a stillborn baby, had given her \" the best life. \"",

        "summary": "A white house directive has reportedly given the fbi broad authorization to interview anyone necessary in its investigation into president trump's supreme court pick brett kavanaugh. Sources tell the new york times the move came after democrats criticized the white house's call for an investigation of sexual assault allegations against kavanaugh that was narrow in scope. What's more, democrats have also previously suggested the white house barred investigators from speaking to specific people related to the case. Trump spoke to reporters outside the white house on monday, where he said \"the fbi should interview anybody that they want within reason, but you have to say within reason. \" however, trump reaffirmed his support of his nominee and characterized the allegations against him and ensuing outcry \" so unfair \" while also sticking to his requirement that the investigation, which republican sen. Jeff flake of arizona first demanded, be completed within days. Though the president has asked that the investigation be \" comprehensive \" and says he's comfortable with investigators sitting down with kavanaugh himself and speaking with additional accusers who've come forward, he stressed that it must all be done by the end of the week. Majority leader mitch mcconnell promised from the senate floor monday that the vote will take place this week, while accusing democrats of obstruction. \" the time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close, \" mcconnell said, per the ap.

That after a diabetic former employee won a lawsuit connected to the juice. Linda atkins was working at a maryville, tenn., location in the fall of 2011 when she felt a hypoglycemic attack coming on. The main cashier was on break, and so \" to avoid leaving the cash register unattended, and for the security of the store, \" atkins grabbed a bottle of oj from the cooler, drank it, and then paid for it once her blood sugar had stabilized. Wbir reports the same thing happened again the following january. She was fired for \" grazing, \" and the equal employment opportunity commission sued. On sept. 16 atkins was awarded $ 27,565 in back wages and $ 250,000 in compensatory damages, per an eeoc press release. The backstory is that atkins asked her supervisor if she could keep her own juice at the register but was told that violated store policy — except that policy allows exceptions for people with medical needs. Atkins ' firing was precipitated by a march 2012 \" shrinkage \" audit to investigate any employee thefts at the store; two employees who admitted to \" grazing \" pointed out that atkins had done it as well. That's when atkins was fired, though the auditors were aware of the medical angle and that she had ultimately paid for the drinks. While the jury found atkins was wrongfully fired and that the americans with disabilities act was violated, it didn't find the managers acted with malicious intent, thus there are no punitive damages, reports the knoxville news sentinel.

According to the hindu, security workers at vibgyor high school suspected around 4am that there was a leopard inside the school and cctv \" confirmed their fear. \" they called in forestry department workers, and \" two teams were formed to scour the school, \" the paper reports. A 10-hour drama followed, with the leopard fleeing to nearby woods before returning to the school, where it made its way from room to room as workers tried to trap it. The hindu reports that after the big cat was shot by a tranquilizer, it appeared to panic and went on an \" attacking spree \" before the drugs kicked in. Six people were mauled, including a wildlife conservationist who tried to scale a wall to escape the leopard when it attacked him by the school's swimming pool but was dragged back down. The leopard was captured after the tranquilizers took effect, and it will be released into a national park, reports the bbc, which notes that habitat loss has caused a rise in leopard-human clashes. ( in another indian city, a leopard terrorized a hospital for 12 hours. )",

David turpin, 56, and louise turpin, 49, of perris, calif., were charged thursday with multiple felony counts of torture, child abuse, abuse of dependent adults, and false imprisonment. David turpin was hit with an additional count of a lewd act on a child under 14. The los angeles times reports that a conviction could bring 94 years to life in prison. The update came via riverside county district attorney mike hestrin during a thursday press conference on the couple and their 13 children, who were found shackled and malnourished in the home sunday. \" this is severe, emotional, physical abuse.... This is depraved conduct, \" hestrin said. More on their state, the situation, and the charges: cnn explains the couple will each face 12 counts of torture regarding the children's malnutrition, not 13, as the youngest child — age 2 — appeared sufficiently fed, said hestrin. The oldest of the turpins ' children is a 29-year-old female who weighs 82 pounds. He said some of the children suffered cognitive impairments from the lack of food. Abc news adds that the siblings were allegedly only able to bathe once a year. Hestrin said that if they washed their hands above the wrist it was considered playing, and they were chained.",

But unlike most factories, his doesn't fabricate anything. At cryos international, some 1,000 donors are paid $ 15 to $ 76 for each deposit — of sperm. Schou, who has created one of the biggest sperm banks in the world in denmark, turns around and sells a vial for $ 45 to $ 1,137, depending on the \" potency and donor profiles, \" as cnn puts it. Since founding cryos in 1987, schou has shipped sperm around the world and says his company is responsible for 27,000 babies. Business is only looking up: the us, uk, china, new zealand, and israel are suffering shortages. The demand is partly due to what the financial times calls a \" delayer boom, \" as women are waiting to have kids and may find their fertility is reduced. \" the highest growth comes from single women who make up about 50 % of demand, \" schou says, adding the figure could climb to 70 % by 2020. Keeping on top of the demand isn't easy, though. Only 10 % of donors have sperm that can withstand freezing and storage, and some are turned off by restrictions related to sex, smoking, and drugs while donating. As for how the sperm gets to women, the times notes that cryos ( as well as similar us firms ) can ship straight to a woman's home, allowing her to self-inseminate. \" the authorities can't do anything about it, \" says schou. The authorities also can't restrict how many women one man's sperm can go to. There are no regulations, and schou estimates an average donor at his company will father 25 children.

Before the times article, for which he gave wil s. Hylton multiple interviews, marlow's main foray into the spotlight was an appearance on bill maher's show. ( video of that interview is here. ) in fact, the appearance crystallizes marlow's unusual situation, writes hylton. Afterward, he was pilloried on the left because, during the \" overtime \" part of the show, a counterterrorism expert said a \" fake \" story about him at breitbart led to death threats and demanded an apology. But marlow also got pilloried on the right for telling maher that russia had indeed meddled in the election. The latter admission showed that marlow \" does not get basic narratives, \" in the damning words of one breitbart writer who quit and called marlow \" traitor in chief. \" the story explores how marlow is trying to bring more credibility to the site as he navigates critics from the left and right, and it quotes a harvard law professor who has been conducting a linguistic study of stories. \" breitbart is not the alt-right, \" says yochai benkler. Headlines may be extreme, but the stories themselves often are surprisingly neutral. He sees breitbart, then, as a \" bridge \" of sorts, \" in which extremist sites linked to breitbart for validation, and those same fanatics could then gather in breitbart's comment section to hurl invectives, \" writes hylton.

Or that during his trial, he represented himself dressed in a purple cowboy costume and tried to get 200 witness subpoenas, including ones for jfk and jesus. Or even that he had been diagnosed as schizophrenic in 1978 and had been in and out of 12 mental hospitals over a 14-year period. But texas state had still planned to execute him tonight — until the execution was halted by the fifth circuit court of appeals just eight hours before his scheduled lethal injection, the ap reports. The two-sentence ruling says the court needs time to \" fully consider the late arriving and complex legal questions at issues in this matter. \" panetti's attorneys have argued that he's \" delusional \" and that his death wouldn't prove an effective deterrent or retribution for anybody, the ap notes. In 2002, the supreme court prohibited the execution of the mentally impaired, but in a 2007 panetti appeal, the court said mentally ill prisoners could be executed if they can reasonably understand why they're being punished. His attorneys argue he has no clue what's going on and that his mental-illness history would make his execution cruel and unusual. \" nobody exists for 36 years like this in an effort to get off the hook of criminal responsibility, \" a member of panetti's defense team says, per time. Even his ex-wife, the daughter of the victims, said in a 1999 affidavit cited by the texas tribune that \" i know now that scott is mentally ill and should not be put to death. \" prosecutors think he's exaggerating, though, and that some of his actions are \" contrived, \" the ap notes, adding that a hearing will soon be scheduled.

Keaton — who won the best actress oscar for her role alongside allen in 1977's annie hall, which allen also directed — took to twitter on monday to describe allen as her friend. \" i continue to believe him, \" she wrote, per usa today, sharing a link to a 60 minutes interview allen gave in 1992. The same interview — in which allen claims a bitter divorce kept him from mia farrow's connecticut home, where the alleged abuse is to have taken place — brought dylan farrow to tears during a recent interview. \" he's lying and he's been lying for so long, \" farrow told cbs this morning, claiming allen led her to an attic at age 7 and \" touched my labia and my vulva with his finger. \" like keaton, alec baldwin and scarlett johansson have defended allen, though mira sorvino and natalie portman are among the celebrities who say they believe farrow's account. So, too, it seems does judd apatow. Responding to keaton's tweet monday, apatow described allen as \" so awful \" to the farrow family, per deadline. \" i see a man who wanted what he wanted, \" he added in a tweet referencing allen's romantic relationship with stepdaughter soon-yi previn, which prompted his divorce from mia farrow.

        "summary": "When the temperature drops, the number of heart attacks goes up, according to a massive 16-year study of some 280,000 patients in sweden. \" there is seasonal variation in the occurrence of heart attack, with incidence declining in summer and peaking in winter, \" says the lead author in a press release, though it's \" unclear whether this is due to colder temperatures or behavioral changes. \" the team out of lund university announced its findings at the european society of cardiology congress in barcelona this week. Using the swedish myocardial infarction registry ( swedeheart ), they were able to track every heart attack treated across sweden between 1998 and 2013. They found significantly more heart attacks in sub-zero temps and fewer in summer months, per asian age — to the tune of about four more incidents per day when it's below freezing than when it's above 50 degrees. There could be various factors at play: our bodies have ways of coping with extreme cold, such as shivering and elevated heart rates, which help raise body temperature but also increase blood pressure. That's no problem for most healthy people, but researchers think that signals trouble for those with plaques in their coronary arteries. Other potential factors tied to the seasons are decreased physical activity, dietary changes, and increased cases of respiratory tract infections and flu. Huffpost reports that extreme cold is one of several \" forgotten \" risk factors of heart attacks, with large meals and sudden exertion ( think snow shoveling ) topping the list. ( watch out for high doses of this over-the-counter drug, too. )",

            "According to researchers, lower temperatures act as an external trigger for the life threatening condition. Researchers at lund university in sweden found that there was a higher occurrence of heart attacks in sub-zero temperatures. London: heart attacks are more prevalent in the winter season, as lower temperatures act as an external trigger for the life threatening condition, a study claims. Researchers at lund university in sweden found that there was a higher occurrence of heart attacks in sub-zero temperatures. When the daily temperature was less than zero degree celsius, the average rate of heart attacks a day peaked to four, as compared to when it was above 10 degrees, researchers said. Furthermore, occurrence of heart attacks was increased with higher wind velocities, limited sunshine duration and higher air humidity. The findings were the same across a large range of patient subgroups, and at national as well as regional levels, suggesting that air temperature is a trigger for heart attack. The body responds to cold by constricting superficial blood vessels, which decreases thermal conduction in the skin and subsequently increases arterial blood pressure, researchers said.

North korea said last week that it is planning to carry out a rocket-powered satellite launch between april 12 and 16, alarming countries around the region.

A rep tells the los angeles times that the six \" put a new offer on the table. We're hoping iran will react in a good way. \" no further details were given. The six's main goal centers around making sure iran isn't trying to build a nuke. That means getting iran to stop enriching uranium to 20 % purity, and export any that it has already enriched to that level.

Baghdad -- officials of six world powers and iran gathered today in a hopeful but subdued atmosphere for one or two days of talks on iran's disputed nuclear program. The six world powers opened the meeting at an imposing guest house in baghdad's international zone at midday with a group session led by catherine ashton, the european union's foreign policy chief. The group is expected to outline a proposed interim deal under which iran would halt production of 20 % enriched uranium, which can be purified relatively easily to material that can be used in a nuclear bomb. It would also surrender control of all of the material and dismantle an underground bunker where it is being refined. In return, the other nations would hold off on further sanctions against iran and would provide"

Researchers at the university of florida have discovered some merit to the bizarre-sounding notion, reports futurity. Knowing that patients in cognitive decline often lose their sense of smell first, the researchers had patients sniff a dollop of peanut butter with each nostril separately. They used a ruler to measure the point at which people detected the odor ( and to keep the other nostril closed ). The weird result: people with a confirmed diagnosis of early-stage alzheimer's could smell it fine with their right nostril, but not their left, say the uf scientists. Generally speaking, the right nostril picked up on it 10cm before the left one. Also of note: the left-right difference is specific to alzheimer's, and doesn't apply to other forms of dementia. \" at the moment, we can use this test to confirm diagnosis, \" says the lead researcher. \" but we plan to study patients with mild cognitive impairment to see if this test might be used to predict which patients are going to get alzheimer's disease. \" bravo, says dan nosowitz at popsci. This could end up being an easy, cheap, and effective weapon in the alzheimer's fight.

            "Cleveland ( ap ) — a cleveland radio station says it has stopped playing \" baby, it's cold outside \" after listeners said the song heard on countless holiday playlists is inappropriate. They're certainly not the first to question the song's undertones and criticize the duet, in which one singer tries to persuade the other to stay and their exchanges include lyrics like \" what's in this drink? \" and \" baby, don't hold out. \" wdok-fm midday host glenn anderson says he recognizes that society was different when the song was written back in 1944, but he doesn't think it has a place today, especially in the era of the #metoo movement against sexual harassment. He announced on the pop music station's website this week that the song would no longer be in its around-the-clock rotation of holiday music.",

Wdok christmas 102.1 pulled the song from its around-the-clock rotation of christmas music this week after receiving a call from a listener who suggested it is inappropriate in 2018. The call-and-response song written in the 1940's includes a woman singing that she has to leave a man's house as he tries to lure her to stay. In the song, the female sings \"i really can't stay, \" to which the man responds, \"but baby, it's cold outside. \" other lyrics include the woman singing \"say, what's in this drink? \" and \"i simply must go … the answer is no. \" \"it wasn't really our decision. It's the decision of our listeners, \" said wdok midday host desiray, noting that the christmas lineup is decided by the station's listeners.
