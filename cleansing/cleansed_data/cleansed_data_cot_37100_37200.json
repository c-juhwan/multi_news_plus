        "summary": "People who were single and unhappy about it on valentine's day might be cheered by the story of emma morano, who has been single for the last 77 valentine's days and says it has helped her to live to the age of 115. The italian, believed to be the oldest living european and the 5th oldest person in the world, says she remained single after her first marriage ended in 1938. The new york times reports she has kept up a doctor's long-ago recommendation to eat three raw eggs a day ( since reduced to two ), which makes for a tally of around 100,000 eggs over her long life. In a 2013 interview with la stampa translated by news.au.com she expounded upon her food habits: \" for breakfast i eat biscuits with milk or water. \" then come the eggs, followed by \" pasta and minced meat... For dinner, i ' ll have just a glass of milk. \" she also apparently has genes on her side: one of eight children, morano says one of her sisters lived to 102 and another died just before she hit the century mark. Morano still lives alone in a small apartment, with a doctor checking on her once a month and a niece handling her meals daily. As someone who was alive for every minute of the 20th century, she has lived through huge amounts of upheaval, but her memories are mostly ones of personal events, the times reports. \" my sisters and i loved to dance and we'd run away to the dance hall and then our mother would come looking for us with a birch stick, \" she recalls. On her decision to stay single in the decades after her marriage ended following the death of an infant son, she tells the times that she \" didn't want to be dominated by anyone. \" ( the founder of paypal plans to live even longer than morano. )",

            "Ms. Morano has no doubts about how she made it this long: her elixir for longevity consists of raw eggs, which she has been eating — three per day — since her teens when a doctor recommended them to counter anemia. Assuming she has been true to her word, ms. Morano would have consumed around 100,000 eggs in her lifetime, give or take a thousand, cholesterol be damned. She is also convinced that being single for most of her life, after an unhappy marriage that ended in 1938 following the death of an infant son, has kept her kicking. Separation was rare then, and divorce became legal in italy only in 1970. She said she had plenty of suitors after that, but never chose another partner. \"i didn't want to be dominated by anyone, \" she said. Gerontologists agree that there is no one key to longevity. \"you talk to 100 centenarians, you get 100 different stories, \" said valter d. Longo, the director of the longevity institute at the university of southern california, whose studies suggest that diet is an important factor in living longer. And there's genetics. \"we do know that the ability to make it to 110 is heritable, so you have a large increase in chance if you have several people in your family to live to a late",

Ms morano was born in 1899 and is the fifth-oldest person in the world. The super centenarian lives in verbania in northern italy, is in \" good health \" and still spends her days doing housework and cooking, la stampa reports. Ms morano says her eating habits - including raw egg every day - have helped her live so long. \" for breakfast i eat biscuits with milk or water, \" she said. \" then during the day i eat two eggs - one raw and one cooked - just like the doctor recommended when i was 20 years old. For lunch i ' ll eat pasta and minced meat then for dinner, i ' ll have just a glass of milk. \" she also \" eats a sweet now and then to pass the times \". Sleep is another important factor in her longevity. Ms morano goes to bed before 7pm every night and wakes up before 6am. And long life seems to run in her family - her sister lived to be 102. Ms morano was born in vercelli into a family of eight children. She married in 1926 and had a child who tragically died when he was six months old."

        "summary": "The supreme court's big headline on monday involved partially instating president trump's travel ban, but it was far from the only consequential development on the last day of the court's term. In a big church-state ruling, the court sided with the church. Justices ruled 7-2 that the state of missouri was wrong when it rejected a request from trinity lutheran church in columbia for funds to build a playground, reports nbc news. The church had sought money from a state fund set aside for non-profits. The ruling could jeopardize laws in other states designed to keep a clear separation between church and state, a point emphasized by sonia sotomayor in her dissent. Other developments: gay rights: the court is putting a high-profile case about gay rights on the docket for its next term. The justices will decide whether a baker in denver who objects to same-sex marriage was ok to refuse to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, reports the washington post. The decision would have a bearing on similar lawsuits around the country that pit merchants ' free-speech and religious rights against anti-discrimination laws. Gun rights: the court rejected another call to decide whether americans have a constitutional right to carry guns with them outside their homes, reports the ap. The justices on monday left in place an appeals court ruling that upheld the san diego sheriff's strict limits on issuing permits for concealed weapons. Sheriff joe: the court rejected former sheriff joe arpaio's request to let a jury instead of a judge decide whether he is guilty of a criminal charge for disobeying a court order to stop his immigration patrols. The rejection from the nation's highest court came hours before the retired lawman's trial is set to begin on monday in maricopa county, ariz. Inmate loses: the court ruled against a texas death row inmate who said his lawyers failed to challenge a faulty jury instruction. Erick davila was convicted in 2009 of the shooting deaths of a 5-year-old girl and her grandmother at a children's birthday party, and prosecutors said davila was trying to shoot someone else as part of a gang dispute. Davila claimed the jury should have been instructed it could find him guilty of both murders only if he meant to kill two people. He said he only meant to kill one.",

        "summary": "The amazon river flows eastward toward the atlantic, but researchers know that wasn't always the case, notes the latin times. Long ago, the region's water moved in the opposite direction. Just what was it, though, that caused the reversal? earlier findings linked the shift to the movement of molten rock deep underground, but a new study contests that. A geophysicist at brazil's university of sao paolo used expansive computer modeling to come to a different conclusion: it's all about erosion related to the rising andes mountains as they grew millions of years ago, science reports. Victor sacek's model, laid out in earth and planetary science letters, shows how the region's terrain might have developed over 40 million years, and its results match real-life geological findings. Here's what it suggests: the downward push of the andes mountains created a trough that resulted in lakes. Afterward, sediment poured into these lakes and created higher terrain. That led, 10 million years ago, to ground that sloped from the mountains to the atlantic — and drove the water in that direction. ( meanwhile, scientists think they've figured out where the river actually starts. )",

It deals with some scary themes, but \"in the short term, the movie is a sorta heartwarming entertainment. \" david denby's not so sure: he calls it a \"strange, empty movie, a metaphysical cracker jack box without a prize in its empty-calorie depths. \" still, \"damon and blunt's scenes together, once they stop running, reach a pitch of romantic tension that has almost disappeared from movies, \" he notes in the new yorker.",

Hinckley's brother describes the woman, who hinckley met at a national association for the mentally ill meeting, as \" somewhat compatible \" with his brother, though he adds he has never actually met her. But his 89-year-old mother, with whom hinckley has been staying in williamsburg, va., for 17 days a month, approves. Cbs news reports the girlfriend has substance abuse issues and lives with her parents in the williamsburg area. Hinckley's sister dials the story back a bit, saying she's really more of a friend. Hinckley's lawyer says his client, who costs family members up to $ 10,000 a month, hasn't shown \" a hint of dangerous behavior \" and hopes he ' ll be allowed to live with his mother permanently. Hinckley's brother adds he could live with him in texas after his mother's death, as long as he's employed. Government officials, however, note worrying discrepancies in what hinckley says he does with his time outside of st. Elizabeth's hospital and what he actually gets up to. They cite one case in which he said he was going to see a movie but was found in a bookstore in front of volumes about the reagan shooting. He also visited a recording studio but didn't report the trip. \" now is not the time to release the reins, \" a prosecutor says.

Gary herbert signed into law a bill requiring anesthesia for patients who reach this mark, usa today reports. The \" protecting unborn children \" mandate is the first of its kind to pass in the us, rekindling a debate as to whether a fetus can feel pain at that point in the gestational cycle. ( the washington post notes a review of more than 300 studies shows the fetus likely doesn't perceive pain before 28 weeks. ) the governor \" believes in not only erring on the side of life, but also minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn child, \" a spokesman for herbert said in a statement. The law wouldn't apply in cases where anesthesia could hurt the mother, if the abortion was needed to save the mother's life, or if the fetus suffered from a congenital defect that would prove fatal, per the ap and usa today. Other states have tried for similar laws and failed; a dozen states ban abortion after between 20 and 22 weeks, while others offer the option of anesthesia. Critics note the law could be applied in cases where labor is induced, such as with pre-eclampsia or when a woman's due date has passed. State sen. Curt bramble, who sponsored the bill, argues anesthesia is used in other situations in utah, such as for convicts put to death and animals being put down, so this law simply maintains consistency. \" we go to extraordinary lengths in utah to prevent the pain of an individual sentenced to death, \" he says.",

The five planned to gather at the white house ahead of the dec. 8 government funding deadline to discuss the ways forward: pass a short-term measure that would keep things riding along at current levels, get a spending bill passed, or allow a government shutdown. In a tuesday morning tweet, trump didn't sound overly optimistic about the meeting's prospects: \" meeting with ' chuck and nancy'today about keeping government open and working.

Congress has thus far failed to direct emergency funds to fighting the zika virus, so the cdc rerouted $ 222 million intended for things like emergency response and immunizations to zika. Of that, $ 197.3 million has been spent, reports nbc news, and while the cdc has provided zika-hit florida with everything it has needed, \" we don't have any more resources to give, \" says frieden. The washington post reports the $ 222 million will be used up by late september. And more money could be needed, in florida or elsewhere: \" it's still the peak of mosquito season. It usually doesn't end until the end of october, \" frieden says. Congress is scheduled to vote on a $ 1.1 billion zika package on tuesday, reports the new york times; it's the republican's response to the $ 1.9 billion president obama asked for in february, and smooth sailing is not expected: the package keeps planned parenthood off the list of those receiving funding for contraception as a virus preventative, to some democrats'dismay. In addition to general zika-fighting efforts, frieden says new funding would allow the cdc to create more effective tests for zika, support the nih in its work on a vaccine, and study infected newborns.",

As he has done repeatedly before, trump mocked her claims of native american ancestry with the derisive label of \" pocahontas. \" he told supporters in great falls that he'd like to debate her so he could toss her an ancestry test and challenge her to take it. Trump said he'd give $ 1 million to charity if it \" shows you are an indian, \" adding, \" i have a feeling she will say no, \" per cnn. He also took a subtle shot at the me too movement in the process: \" we ' ll take that little kit and say, we have to do it gently because we are in the me too generation, and we will very gently take that kit, slowly toss it \" to her, trump said. The massachusetts senator fired back on twitter. \" while you obsess over my genes, your admin is conducting dna tests on little kids because you ripped them from their mamas &amp; you are too incompetent to reunite them in time to meet a court order, \" warren wrote. \" maybe you should focus on fixing the lives you're destroying. \" the pocahontas controversy stems from warren claiming native american heritage years ago in a staff directory at harvard law school, though she had only family lore to back up the assertion. Trump was in montana to stump against democratic sen. Jon tester, and politico has plenty more details about his attacks on tester, maxine waters, hillary clinton, the justice department, and more. At one point, he pointed to the journalists at the event, calling them \" really bad people \" and \" so damn dishonest. \"",

Rohani is visiting paris as part of a four-day tour of italy and france beginning november 14 making him the first iranian president to travel to europe in a decade, according to the state news agency irna. The tour – which comes four months after the iran nuclear deal was reached – will first take rohani to italy, where he will meet president sergio mattarella and pope francis, iranian presidential spokesman parviz esmaili told irna. He will then travel to france on november 16-17, where he is expected to give a speech at the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organisation's ( unesco ) headquarters in paris. \"he will officially be received by french president françois hollande on tuesday morning and will hold talks with french government officials before returning to tehran, \" esmaili said. Rohani's upcoming trip has already caused an uproar in france, where rtl radio reported on monday that the iranian president has refused to dine at the elysée presidential palace if wine is served during the meal. Although iran had requested a halal menu, which customarily means no alcohol, france was unwilling to break with the tradition surrounding official state lunches and dinners"

        "summary": "Research has shown animals can smell sickness in others; but for humans, illness is all in the face, the washington post reports. A study published wednesday in proceedings of the royal society b reveals it's possible humans can tell if someone is healthy or sick — even if they aren't coughing or sneezing — just by looking at their face soon after infection. Researchers injected 16 people with lipopolysaccharide, a molecule found in bacterial membranes that activates the immune system and makes people feel sick, and later a placebo then took pictures of their faces two hours later. Researchers then had two groups of 60 or so people look at the photos for five seconds each, according to the guardian. The first identified the individuals as either sick or healthy; the other ranked people's health based on facial properties. Researchers, in what science magazine reports is the first study of its kind, found participants correctly identified sick people 52 % of the time — or slightly better than guessing — and healthy people 70 % of the time. They also found that pale skin and droopy eyelids were the biggest giveaways of a sick individual. A psychologist not involved in the study was surprised to find people are apparently better at judging health by looking at faces than determining other things, such as personalities. \" we probably judge the health in other people all the time, \" says study co-author john axelsson. Experts say this could be an evolutionary trait to help humans avoid getting sick. ( another study found we are the most attracted to the faces around us. )",

Furious gold coast mayor tom tate said the canadian had been disrespectful and \" really, really silly \", and sent a graffiti removal kit to the exclusive qt hotel at surfers paradise so he could repair the damage. \" if a normal person did that they'd be serving 80 to 100 hours of community service, \" tate told the nine network. \" just come and clean it up and we ' ll be happy with you. \" in a separate interview in the brisbane courier-mail, tate said: \" we've all been young once. But by the sounds of it, he's gone and done something really, really silly. \" but he's got an opportunity to make good... I urge him to treat this city the way gold coast fans treat him. \" bieber's handiwork includes a pacman ghost and other fluorescent cartoon characters, reportedly painted in the early hours of wednesday after the star's sell-out brisbane show.

Both bombs exploded near air force intelligence and military security buildings, and most of those killed were members of security forces, although some civilians were also reported to be among the dead. Some reports said the attacks were made by suicide bombers. The syrian state-run news agency put the number killed at eight, blaming the attack, as usual, on \" armed terrorists. \" rebels also reportedly fired rockets at the syrian central bank building in damascus this morning, and the new york times reports that if true, the strike would indicate a push by the rebels to damage symbols of state power. Government reports said no one was injured and the building suffered only \" material damages \" in the attack. In addition, a car bomb was reported in the suburbs of damascus, injuring four police officers.

The lake can hold 975,000 acre feet when full, but it's now approaching the 100,000 acre feet \" dead zone, \" at which point it would be too low to reach intake pipes, affecting water for three cities.

This culminates a rigorous, thorough process over many months, and yields a great outcome for the company. Today's announcement not only brings us an important step toward separating yahoo's operating business from our asian asset equity stakes, it also presents exciting opportunities to accelerate yahoo's transformation. Among the many entities that showed interest in yahoo, verizon believed most in the immense value we've created, and in what a combination could bring our users, our advertisers, and our partners. This is a good moment to reflect on yahoo's journey to date. Yahoo is a company that changed the world. Before yahoo, the internet was a government research project. Yahoo humanized and popularized the web, email, search, real-time media, and more. What really sets yahoo apart is the shared passion to create great products for our 1b+ users, and in doing so, transforming the world for the better. You can clearly see that spirit, that commitment, that fight in the work we've done together over the past few years. We set out to transform this company – and we've made incredible progress.

            "Jerusalem — when israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu called for elections in october, he quickly moved to unify his right-wing likud party with the even more right-wing party of his foreign minister, avigdor lieberman. As a result, experts considered the pair a shoo-in to dominate the election. Polls predicted the joint team could gain up to 45 seats in the 120-seat knesset, israel's parliament. It was taken as an article of faith that the canny netanyahu had safeguarded his rightward flank through the union with lieberman and that, at the very least, he would maintain the 41 seat bloc they hold today. While not an outright majority, that kind of win could have led to an easily constructed coalition with the addition of just one mid-sized party from israel's turnstile stable of them. But something has happened on the way to the voting booths, which open on jan. 22. The latest polls show netanyahu's likud down to as low as 32 seats. Of course, being the frontrunner — while enviable — carries certain risks, including voter indifference or apathy. In addition, the likud campaign team, once thought of as a well-oiled if not unbeatable machine, has proven itself surprisingly lackluster this electoral season.

But the definitive earliest reported use of what we now know of as zero comes from an indian manuscript, which has just been dated to the third or fourth century — hundreds of years earlier than previously thought, according to the bbc. The bakhshali manuscript was found by a farmer in 1881 in what's now pakistan. It appears to be a training manual for silk road merchants, and its birch bark pages contain hundreds of zeros, which originally appeared as dots before developing their hollow center. While other cultures developed different symbols to represent concepts similar to zero, it was this dot that carried on into the modern world. Du sautoy says the introduction of zero was a \" total revolution \" and one of the \" greatest breakthroughs \" in mathematics. It's a concept the greeks never arrived at and that europeans had a very hard time grasping. \" the europeans, even when it was introduced to them, were like, ' why would we need a number for nothing?

Writing for the guardian, nic marks understands the reasoning of those who feel the un should worry more about things like north korea and syria, but argues that \" happiness is a serious 21st-century global issue, \" with unhappiness breeding crime-filled neighborhoods and less productive businesses. \" how on earth are we going to create political, economic, and social systems that support nine billion people to live in harmony with each other and the one planet we all share? \"",

Johnson had led the charge for the uk to exit the european union in the brexit vote, and he was expected to officially launch his campaign to lead the ruling conservative party thursday. Instead, he declared it \" cannot be me, \" reports the telegraph, an announcement that followed another stunner by just a matter of minutes: justice minister michael gove, who had been expected to back johnson, instead announced that he would be running. \" i have come, reluctantly, to the conclusion that boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead, \" said gove. The guardian provides some analysis: \" for johnson, to be abandoned by the guarantor of his candidacy and his most exalted supporter — and at this particular stage — is the worst setback in his political career. \" the moves will apparently leave gove and home secretary theresa may as frontrunners to become the next prime minister in september, and to formally begin the process leading to the uk's exit from the eu. May, unlike gove, voted to stay in the eu but has said she would respect the referendum's outcome. All this comes as the rival labour party is in disarray of its own: leader jeremy corbyn lost a confidence vote but refuses to leave.",

Romney said. \"and he said to his dad, can i borrow some money, i want to start a business. \" his father was skeptical, but he loaned him $ 20,000. \"the only thing that would work for $ 20,000 was a sandwich shop, so he started making sandwiches, \" mr. Romney said. The rest, mr. Romney said, is more or less history. His outfit went national. \"his sandwiches are doing pretty well, \" mr. Romney said, chuckling. Mr. Romney encouraged the students in the room"

        "summary": "More than 1,000 pages of newly declassified documents reveal that, time and time again, the national security agency acknowledged it had violated us surveillance rules and promised it would do better, only to have the cycle repeat itself. Among the excuses the nsa gave to a us intelligence court for why it continued to improperly collect americans ' phone records: \"poor management, lack of involvement by compliance officials, and lack of internal verification procedures. \" in one instance, it even blamed a typo, the ap reports. The files were released by the obama administration last night as part of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the nsa's phone records collection. The documents also include what appears to be the original authorization for the nsa to collect email records, the washington post reports. Prior to july 2004, the nsa was collecting those records secretly, without approval from congress or a court, as part of a post-september 11, bush-authorized terrorist surveillance program. A court order from july 2004 makes the argument for continued collection under the foreign intelligence surveillance act, and puts it under court supervision. Click for more on the release from the post and the ap. And in more nsa news: since edward snowden first leaked information about the nsa's surveillance programs, foia requests for nsa records are up 888 %, usa today reports. It's \"the largest spike we've ever had, \" says an nsa employee. But the nsa is responding to requests from individuals asking if they're being spied on with just a form letter saying the agency can neither confirm nor deny any intelligence-gathering. The supreme court yesterday refused a request from a privacy group to stop the nsa from collecting verizon phone records, but other lawsuits related to nsa programs are still making their way through the courts. A norwegian newspaper recently reported that the nsa spied on norway, collecting records of more than 33 million phone conversations in just one month. But now norway's intelligence service says it was doing the collecting, not the nsa, reuters reports. However, the head of the intelligence service says the data was shared with the us.",

Another drug that's been in use since the 1970s, however, is showing promise for treating similar conditions, and it's known for not having many side effects; this site lists gallstones and liver problems as \" infrequent \" ones. Fenofibrate, aka tricor, is currently used to treat high cholesterol. The link between the two drugs has to do with the way they bind to cells, popular science reports. Compounds in fenofibrate adhere to what are known as cannabinoid receptors in some cell membranes — just as compounds in marijuana do. In the lab, scientists found that fenofibrate made cells with these receptors behave in the same way marijuana does. The discovery could pave the way for a new class of pot-like drugs, researchers say. \" it may be difficult to persuade people in colorado, washington, and the district of columbia that there are people who want the beneficial effects of marijuana without actually getting high, \" says the editor of the faseb journal, where the research report was published, in a press release. \" but there are people who do not want to get stoned just to get the relief that marijuana brings. \" ( here's what's really in retail pot. )",

Founder maneesh sethi says the fitness-tracking wristband he devised can keep track of things like gym visits and steps walked in a day — and gives users a brief but sharp electric shock in the wrist if they fail, the telegraph reports. The idea is to jolt people into adopting better habits, he says. \" research shows that consistency is the key to forming a habit, \" pavlok says on its website. \" when you use pavlok to stick to your goals, you ' ll find that they become easier and, eventually, automatic. \" \" it sits on my wrist, and at 6am it ' ll vibrate, \" sethi explains. \" i can snooze it, but if i snooze it twice, it shocks me. \" he says he lost 30 pounds using the device, according to engadget. Sethi says he aims to have pavlok on the market next year, but a limited number of prototypes will be released this fall. The idea of wearable technology that causes you pain sounds pretty chilling to andrew leonard at salon. \" what happens when workers are required to submit to pavlok shock therapy in order to qualify for an employer's healthcare coverage? \" he wonders. \" pavlok will know when you're reaching for that jumbo soda or are binge-watching orange is the new black.

According to sethi, his productivity quadrupled. So of course now he has a startup called pavlok, which plans to sell a fitness tracker that delivers an electric shock every time it senses that you are slacking off. Advertisement: pavlok. Get it? it's obviously a play on pavlov, the russian physiologist who trained a dog to salivate every time a bell rang, by associating the sound with the presentation of food. In the new tech economy, we are all pavlov's dog. As the current tech business cycle revs ever hotter, it's getting increasingly difficult to distinguish the hoaxes from the legitimate business enterprise. Every day is april fools'day in silicon valley. But pavlok appears to be real",

The family has military insurance under tricare, but it initially refused to pay for the operation because of alexis ' age. At that point, national media picked up on the story, and a gofundme page for alexis has raised more than $ 78,000 to date to help defray costs. All that money may not be necessary now, given that tricare informed the family yesterday that the operation would be covered. \" i couldn't ask for anything more, \" says mom jenny shapiro. \" i ' m just so happy. \" the surgery is expected to take place in a matter of weeks, and the family says any excess donations will go to kids with similar trouble.",

And on friday, that second driver — 25-year-old ronald o ' kelly — received a suspended sentence that could see him spend just 120 days in jail, the kansas city star reports. Bronson, 57, was riding his motorcycle in kansas city just after midnight on april 7, 2013, when o ' kelly, who ultimately pleaded guilty, hit him with his ford f-150 after failing to stop at a red light. O ' kelly then fled the scene. \" it's unthinkable, \" says bronson's stepson of the sentence. \" it teaches other drunk drivers that if they get in a wreck — fatality or nonfatality — to just run and you will get a light sentence. \" the judge and prosecutors say they were limited in their sentencing ability by the evidence they had available — as wfsb points out, investigators could not prove o ' kelly's blood alcohol content at the time of the crash. Cell phone records showed that o ' kelly was on his phone at the time of the accident, and witnesses said he had been drinking at a tavern earlier in the night and appeared intoxicated. But one potential witness — his girlfriend, who allegedly told her father that o ' kelly was drunk at the time — never testified, as o ' kelly married her, and missouri law does not require spouses to testify in such cases. O ' kelly, who had a prior dui conviction and who told the family he was \" super sorry about what happened, \" was sentenced to seven years on a charge of involuntary vehicular manslaughter due to intoxication and four years on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident, to be served concurrently. But as part of the plea deal, both sentences were suspended as o ' kelly serves a 120-day callback sentence — and if that goes without incident, he ' ll get probation instead of further jail time.

        "summary": "Law enforcement sources have identified the gunman who killed three people and wounded more than a dozen others in a series of shootings in south-central kansas as cedric ford, cbs new york reports. The first officer at the scene of the rampage, which culminated at excel industries in hesston, north of wichita, \" saved a lot of lives \" when he shot and killed the 38-year-old, says harvey county sheriff t. Walton, according to nbc news. Paul mullet, president and ceo of excel, has confirmed that ford, who had a criminal record, worked at the lawn mower manufacturing company. Earlier reports put the number of wounded at 18; that has since been revised to 14, with five in critical condition as of thursday night. Ford, who is listed as living in newton, had a criminal record out of florida, kwch reports. Charges included burglary, grand theft, and fleeing and eluding, among others, dating back to 1996. He was also booked on unspecified charges in sedgwick county, kan., in 2008. Ford's facebook page includes pictures and video of ford holding guns and shooting an assault rifle, which is the type of weapon authorities say was used in the thursday shooting. Nbc notes that permits are not required to buy firearms in kansas, and guns don't need to be registered. Hours after the shooting, police converged on what is believed to be ford's home after receiving a tip that someone might be inside. Police ultimately determined that there was no one in the residence.",

No, it's not an april fools ' joke: a park spokesman confirms that \" guests of the langenberg and sihl restaurants can consume wildlife and livestock meat from the park's animals. \" but he notes the zoo considers the practice to be \" very ecological, \" helping control the population because there's not enough space to house all 100 or so of the animals born there each year. The spokesman adds that 49 deer and 10 wild boar were shot and \" recycled \" in 2012, but he explains that by chowing down on the park's erstwhile residents, visitors will better understand the \" natural cycle \" of things, the local reports. A rep from the foundation for the animal in the law agrees with him in part, saying there's nothing illegal about the zoo's methodology and essentially no \" ethical \" difference between what's going on at langenberg and what goes on at a restaurant that serves meat from farm animals. But a spokesman for an animal welfare group disagrees. \" it appears that the general public and visitors to the zoo are having the same reaction as world animal protection: we are appalled, \" he says. \" i ' m sure if [ people become ] aware that the animals actually ended up on their plates at lunchtime, then they ' ll vote with their feet and won't go to the zoo. \" the only thing the deer and boar have to be thankful for: that they're not excess bison or horses, which apparently get fed to the lynxes and wolves.

Popular science reports astronomers working with data from hubble now say there are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the universe. That's at least 10 times as many as the 100 billion to 200 billion estimated back in the mid-90s, according to a hubble press release. \" it boggles the mind, \" astronomer christopher conselice says. Popular mechanics reports it took 15 years of studying data for astronomers to reach the new estimate for galaxies, 90 % of which we can't see even with the best telescopes because they are too small or faint. But astronomers are hopeful that number drops slightly with the launch of the james webb space telescope in 2018. With billions and billions more galaxies in the universe, astronomers have a lot to mull over. For example, the probability that intelligent life exists somewhere else in the universe just went up thanks to the new galaxies, which popular mechanics says make \" it even more astronomically unlikely that we are alone. \" astronomers also used the data to look 13 billion years into the past, discovering that the number of galaxies dwindles over time as they merge together. The new galaxies also aren't going to help people still befuddled by olber's paradox, which geekwire explains as the question of why the sky is dark at night despite the billions of galaxies and countless stars that should be lighting up every square inch of it.
