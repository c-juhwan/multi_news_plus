The atheist ireland website has put up 25 quotes it says would run afoul of the 2-day-old law, which forbids \" publishing or uttering matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters sacred by any religion. \" those convicted face a fine of about $ 35,000. The group hopes to challenge the law in court, notes the guardian. On its list is one from carlin: \" religion easily has the greatest bullshit story ever told. \" bjork: \" fuck the buddhists. \" jesus, telling jews: \"ye are of your father the devil. \" and, of course, frank zappa: \" to hang all this desperate sociology on the idea of the cloud-guy who has the big book, who knows if you've been bad or good...

        "summary": "A 23-year-old surfer in western australia has lost both hands and one arm from the elbow down in a shark attack that has renewed debate on the state's controversial shark cull policy. A witness says sean pollard believed he had been attacked by two bronze whaler sharks in a \" feeding frenzy, \" but authorities say it's much more likely that a great white shark was responsible, perth now reports. Two great whites were caught and killed after the attack off the remote kelpids beach yesterday, but officials say that since it \" is common for sharks to disgorge stomach contents, \" it may not be possible to confirm if either shark was involved in the attack. None of the 172 sharks caught under the cull program were great whites. Pollard, an electrician and semi-professional australian rules football player, also suffered lacerations to his leg and is being treated in a perth hospital, the australian reports. After the attack — which his girlfriend witnessed from the beach — he was assisted by a fellow surfer who ran to assist and an off-duty ambulance officer. The director of the sea shepherd conservation society says the incident demonstrates that culling and killing sharks doesn't work. \" there is no such thing as a rogue shark, they don't exist — they exist in hollywood in films like jaws and that's it, \" he tells the australian broadcasting company. The policy was suspended earlier this year, and the government plans to introduce shark barriers at beaches instead, though none were planned for the beach where pollard was attacked.",

Archaeologists found the prints on an island in british columbia, canada, while seeking evidence of the coastal migration theory, which posits that humans traveled down the coast after crossing over from eurasia — versus the long-running notion that they followed game herds into north america's interior as glaciers melted. \" the footprints... Add to the growing body of evidence that humans inhabited the pacific coast of canada \" in an era that ended about 11,700 years ago, per the study published this week. Makes sense, gizmodo points out, since the ocean is great for finding food and much of north america was still plagued by glaciers at that time. Yet the huge block of ice that barred passage from eurasia to north america — the cordilleran ice sheet — melted about 15,000 to 16,000 years ago, and archaeologists radiocarbon dated the footprints to about 13,000 years ago, so they may just show inhabitants rather than pioneers moving down the coast. The find \" would push evidence of northwest coast human occupation back about 400 years, but it still postdates the widespread occurrence of... Populations throughout north america, \" says an archaeologist not involved in the study. Adding to the mystery is other recent evidence of humans along florida's gulf coast roughly 14,550 years ago and in south america 18,500 years ago, science news points out.

They simply embraced an ideological framework that certainly, i think, is wrong. And i think most of the world now having seen where it took us, would agree that it was wrong. And they fundamentally misunderstood how markets work. That's sort of a broad statement, and yet i think it's accurate. I don't think alan greenspan really understood markets. He didn't understand human behavior. He didn't understand the drive and urge on the part of market participants to play games, to over-leverage, to cheat, to break the rules that are essential for a market to work, and therefore he and those who were participants in this world view did not believe in either parameters for leverage, or enforcement when it came to principles of integrity and transparency. We could have a more complicated discussion of externalities and how you can get to systemic risk, but there was that ideological backdrop. There were also individual malefactors who committed outright fraud. You have bernie madoff at one extreme, you have people who were marketing mortgages that they knew were not real, in the sense that the borrower could not repay. You had people who were putting triple a ratings on debt that was not good. You had people who were lying about the value of the house;",

Pat toomey, calling her \" exactly the kind of partner we need in the senate. \" she's thrown $ 1 million into senate and governor's races in indiana and missouri, two states she is unlikely to carry, and her campaign manager estimates the campaign has spent $ 100 million with the dnc to help other democrats out. \" as we're traveling in these last 17 days, we're going to be emphasizing the importance of electing democrats down the ballot, \" clinton said saturday. She's got other top-tier help, with president obama heading to nevada to stump for not only clinton, but also the democrat looking to keep harry reid's senate seat in the party, notes the ap.

The white house has started dribbling them out, and is \" focused mostly on swing districts for maximum impact, \" says the white house political director. Meanwhile, with trump struggling, the democrats and taking the opportunity to hit republicans — like marco rubio, who now finds himself in a tightening florida senate race — for standing by their man. \" how can you call [ trump ] a 'con artist ' and 'dangerous, ' and object to all the controversial things he says, and then say, 'but i ' m still going to vote for him '?? \" obama asked a florida rally. \" c ' mon, man. \"",

Wibw notes that, as a \" master litigator, \" phelps effectively fought efforts from the city of topeka in the 1990s to prevent picketing outside homes and churches ( though westboro certainly didn't win all of its court battles ), but recent years saw his children and grandchildren ( as young as seven ) take the helm of the picketing efforts, which targeted military funerals along with those of frank sinatra, coretta scott king, and many, many more. The washington post notes that even the ku klux klan found phelps ' \" bigotry \" distasteful, and adds that the southern poverty law center called westboro \" arguably the most obnoxious and rabid hate group in america. \" among their slew of offensive signs: \" thank god for dead soldiers \" and \" god hates [ expletive ]. \" phelps was ultimately booted from his own church; it's unclear who will take the lead.",

The history-making results in four states: nevada: former nevada attorney general catherine cortez masto, 52, won a competitive race to take retiring sen. Harry reid's seat, becoming the first latina in the us senate. Cortez masto kept the seat in democratic hands with her win over rep. Joe heck, reports politico. California: kamala harris became the first black senator from california, as well as the first indian-american senator, when the democrat won the seat vacated by retiring sen. Barbara boxer, per the los angeles times. Harris will be only the second black woman to serve in the us senate. Harris was also the first woman elected as california's attorney general. Oregon: it became the first us state to elect an openly gay governor, democrat kate brown, reports npr. Brown, who is bisexual, was actually the incumbent: she stepped in as governor in 2012 when john kitzhaber resigned. Though the first openly gay governor elected, brown isn't the first to serve: former new jersey gov. Jim mcgreevey came out as gay in 2004 while in office. Minnesota: ilhan omar, 34, also a democrat, was elected as a state representative in minnesota, making her the first somali-american legislator in the us.

The blasts struck istanbul's ataturk airport, which is the base of turkish airlines and a target certain to draw a strong response from the turkish government. \" this is a symbolic attack against the heart of turkey, \" soner cagaptay from the washington institute for near east policy tells the washington post. He says that if the attack was indeed the work of isis, as authorities believe, it represents a major escalation and fighting the group will \" now be unavoidable \" for turkey. In other coverage: reuters reports that officials say the three attackers arrived by taxi and blew themselves up in the airport's arrival hall. At least one opened fire in the departures hall. Security footage shows another being shot and falling to the ground before detonating his explosives. Turkish president recep tayyip erdogan said the attack will be a \" turning point \" in the global fight against terrorism, the bbc reports. \" the bombs that exploded in istanbul today could have gone off at any airport in any city around the world, \" he said. Most of the victims are believed to be turkish, but an iranian and a ukrainian were also killed, the ap reports. The airport, europe's third-busiest after london heathrow and paris charles de gaulle, reopened to flights early wednesday. Isis hasn't claimed responsibility, but authorities are focusing on the group instead of turkish militants, the new york times reports. Some analysts suspect the attack is a response to a recent thaw in relations with israel. The guardian reports that the attack will be a serious blow to turkey's tourism industry, which was already struggling. China has now warned its citizens against travel there. The attack was condemned by the us presidential candidates, the washington post reports. \" all americans stand united with the people of turkey against this campaign of hatred and violence, \" hillary clinton said in a statement. Donald trump told a rally in ohio that \" there's something going on that's really, really bad, \" and we must \" do everything in our power to improve our security to keep america safe. \"",

The new york times reports that the department of homeland security is formally ending a post-9/11 program that targeted males 16 and older from arab or mostly muslim nations via interrogations, fingerprinting, and check-ins, and it's a program that's already been unused since 2011. \" dhs ceased use of nseers more than five years ago, after it was determined the program was redundant, inefficient, and provided no increase in security, \" dhs spokesman neema hakim tells the times. The dhs request will go on the books in the federal registry on friday. The nseers program was deemed a counterterrorism necessity at the time it was created in 2002, including by goper kris kobach, who helped set up the bush program and whose name was floated for head of trump's dhs before gen. John kelly was picked. But critics said it unfairly targeted arabs and muslims, \" regardless of whether they were suspected or accused of any wrongdoing, \" nys attorney general eric schneiderman said in a statement wednesday, per cnn. Cnn noted in november that the program didn't bring a single terrorism conviction. Dhs officials point toward newer, more efficient initiatives that are \" far better equipped to face the evolving landscape of international terrorism, \" says hakim.

        "summary": "A new analysis of three lunar rocks brought back by apollo astronauts in the ' 60s breathes new life into an old theory some thought too simple: that the moon was created when another planet, theia, crashed into earth billions of years ago, leaving behind molten debris that eventually cooled and moved into a stable orbit around our planet. The problem is that, after numerous inspections of the rocks, no one could find any trace of another planet. Until now. Previous analysis of the samples found they were identical to samples from earth, when they should have shown some difference to indicate they also came from theia. But now, \" we have... Discovered small differences between the earth and the moon, \" the lead researcher tells the bbc. \" this confirms the giant impact hypothesis. \" the difference detected is tiny indeed — the lunar samples carry a barely detectable abundance of oxygen-17, a form of oxygen that has nine neutrons in its atoms instead of the typical eight. In fact, the lunar samples have just 0.012 % more oxygen-17 than is found on earth, but it's enough to suggest the involvement of another planet that also featured more of the element. Scientists spotted the difference using a novel technique, explains time: they sealed the rocks in a chamber of fluorine gas, vaporized a small portion of the rocks with a laser beam, and drained out the gas and vapor, which were then sent through a device called a chromatograph to separate oxygen from the other gases. This also enabled them to spot the same difference in samples previous researchers had looked at and found no difference. ( in other cool space news, astronomers recently discovered a planet with an 8-hour day. )",

            "Astronomers were pretty sure they'd long since solved the mystery of how the moon was born. It was an open question until apollo astronauts started hauling lunar rocks back to earth in the late 1960's, and scientists discovered they were chemically similar to the rocks back home. By the mid-1970s, they had the riddle figured out: billions of years ago, something the size of mars smacked into the earth, creating a moon's worth of molten debris that quickly cooled, moved into a stable orbit and became our familiar cosmic companion. Over the ensuing decades, however, it became clear that houston had a problem. The lunar samples were too similar to those on earth.

            "Astronomers were pretty sure they'd long since solved the mystery of how the moon was born. It was an open question until apollo astronauts started hauling lunar rocks back to earth in the late 1960's, and scientists discovered they were chemically similar to the rocks back home. By the mid-1970s, they had the riddle figured out: billions of years ago, something the size of mars smacked into the earth, creating a moon's worth of molten debris that quickly cooled, moved into a stable orbit and became our familiar cosmic companion. Over the ensuing decades, however, it became clear that houston had a problem. The lunar samples were too similar to those on earth.

        "summary": "In a ruling vox says \" could have a big impact on racism in the justice system, \" the supreme court on tuesday tossed a death sentence rendered almost 30 years ago against a georgia black man, voting 7-1 that state prosecutors kept african-americans off the jury that convicted him, the ap reports. Timothy foster, 48, had been sent to death row for the 1986 death of queen white, a 79-year-old white woman, by an all-white jury, reuters notes. But two decades after his sentence, foster's lawyers finally accessed prosecutors ' jury-selection notes, and what they found was a game changer: the names of a handful of black jury candidates marked with a \" b \" and highlighted, and the word \" black \" clearly circled on juror questionnaires where race is requested, among other evidence. \" the focus on race in the prosecution's file plainly demonstrates a concerted effort to keep black prospective jurors off the jury, \" chief justice john roberts wrote in the court's ruling, which could set the stage for a possible retrial and counted only justice clarence thomas as its lone dissenter, per cnn. The supreme court looked back to batson v. Kentucky, a 1986 case that found removing a juror based on race violates the 14th amendment. The state tried to argue the prosecutors'decision at the time to strike those specific jurors was based on other factors besides race, but the court remained unswayed — mainly because of the notes brought forward by foster's attorneys. \" we have an arsenal of smoking guns in this case, \" stephen bright, foster's lead lawyer, told the justices. Thomas argued that the georgia court's decision that prosecutors weren't engaging in racial discrimination should have been respected. \" i cannot go along with that'sort of sandbagging of state courts, ' \" he wrote in his dissent. \" new evidence should not justify the relitigation of batson claims. \" a law professor tells cnn that thomas'stance is \" flabbergasting \" and \" alarmingly deferential view for a supreme court justice to take. \" ( how would trump's supreme court picks have voted? )",

A lawyer for the family says the evidence is so strong that the indictment is no surprise. \" we're all pleased and happy that the process is beginning now and that there's an end in sight, \" he tells cnn. \" it is the first step towards justice. \"",

As european council president, tusk serves as the chairman when eu leaders meet at summits. Even while in the air, trump kept up the attack.

Republicans probably will still control congress, and they're bound to react to a romney loss by shifting more to the right, argues ponnuru. Neither side will be able to claim a mandate, meaning that the real choice for voters in november is \" one between romney and a unified republican government, or obama and four more years that look a lot like the last two. \" expect to hear this argument a lot in the coming months, writes ed kilgore at the washington monthly, who dismisses it as more gop \" political hostage-taking. \" it boils down to republicans saying, \" give us total power to begin implementing our agenda and start dismantling this silly, expensive new deal/great society system and this european-style progressive tax code, or nothing at all happens. \" remember, though, that at least one big thing will happen if obama wins: his health care reform will survive. Besides, gridlock is ok if \" one of the two major parties will accept nothing short of total power. \" read kilgore's full column here, and ponnuru's here.",

The basic theory is that republicans will not change from their current savage ideological course ( which will actually get more savage if they lose this election they think themselves destined to win ) and are very unlikely to lose enough congressional support to reduce their veto power over legislation. So if you want something new to happen, a president romney and a republican-controlled house and senate ( presumably using reconciliation to do whatever they want without democratic support ) are the only ticket. Here's ponnuru's response to those ( including the president ) who have suggested an obama victory will humble republicans: republicans famously failed to react to their drubbing in 2008 — after which, let's recall, time magazine was running cover stories on their impending extinction — by softening their line on anything. Why would they react that way after an election that goes better for them? especially when they will be looking forward to the gains that the party out of the white house typically makes in midterm elections.

They will have cast a decisive view on how we should move the country forward, and i would hope that the republican party, after a fulsome debate, would say to itself, we need to listen to the american people. \" in another recent interview, obama likened the republican opposition to him to a \"blister \" that will be \"popped \" by the election ( an image for which i will not soon forgive him ). If the president believes anything like this would happen in his second term, he is kidding himself. If obama wins re-election, the republican party will react by moving right, not left.

Ezell ford was shot three times, according to the autopsy — in his right side, right arm, and back, where there was a muzzle imprint with the wound, the bbc reports. Police say ford was stopped after \" acting suspiciously \" on a south la street and was shot after a struggle in which he tried to grab an officer's gun. The autopsy ruled the death a homicide, which is routine for fatal police shootings, and lapd chief charlie beck says the findings back up the police account of events, cbs reports. The chief stresses that the investigation is ongoing and says the autopsy results were not released until now because police were searching for civilian witnesses. Ford, who was unarmed, forced an officer to the ground and tried to remove his gun from his holster; the officer \" yelled to his partner that mr. Ford had his gun, \" beck told reporters. \" the officer's partner then fired two rounds, striking mr. Ford, \" beck said. \" at about the same time, the officer on the ground, while on his back, grabbed his backup weapon, reached around mr. Ford and fired one shot at close range, striking mr. Ford in the back. \" a friend of the family, however, says she saw part of the incident and didn't witness a struggle.

On wednesday, that powder keg finally exploded with two drunk, music-loving women playing the part of the match, the los angeles times reports. According to cnn, the two women started playing loud music from a boom box or portable speaker while the spirit airlines flight from baltimore was taxiing to its gate at los angeles international airport. When fellow passengers asked the women to turn the music down, the women held the boom box over their heads, waved it around, and asked, \" what are you going to do? \" the answer to that question was apparently \" fisticuffs. \" ktla reports cellphone videos ( such as this one or this one ) show three other women getting into a punch-throwing, hair-pulling melee with the original duo. The fight was broken up without any injuries, but the fbi and police were at the gate to greet all five women, according to cbs los angeles. None of the women were arrested or charged for the incident. \"i'd be really afraid just because of all the security and all the issues going on right now, \" one traveler at lax tells cbs. \"a plane is probably the last place you would want to do something like that. \"",

Some final context: president obama's thoughts: while bibi's appearance isn't \" permanently destructive \" to us-israeli relations, \" it is a distraction from what should be our focus, \" he told reuters yesterday. \" and our focus should be, ' how do we stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon? ' \" what bibi will say: a netanyahu aide yesterday said he ' ll spill details on the nuclear talks. Congress members \" do not necessarily know the details of the deal coming together, which we do not see as a good deal, \" the aide said, per reuters. What happens if he spills too much: \" we've continuously provided detailed classified briefings to israeli officials to keep them updated, \" a state department spokeswoman said, per raw story. \" any release of any kind of information like that would, of course, betray that trust. We want to keep talking, of course, but that would be a problem. \" the timing: netanyahu is trying to deflect criticism that he's using this trip to drum up home support before israeli elections march 17. \" the last thing that i would want is for israel to become a partisan issue, \" he told aipac yesterday, per reuters. But it's a complication for obama, who had hoped to wrap up an iran agreement by the end of march, the new york times notes. Israel's main concern: a particular sticking point is the concept of a so-called \" sunset clause, \" meaning that if iran sticks to the terms of any agreement it makes for 10 to 15 years, it would be declassified as a nuclear state. The israeli embassy tweeted an image of a fake newspaper in the year 2025 that shows what would happen if such a clause materialized. Where iran stands: john kerry met with iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif yesterday in switzerland, and iran was pretty clear how it feels about obama's demand that it stop sensitive nuclear activity for 10 years, reuters reports. \" iran will not accept excessive and illogical demands, \" zarif said, per iran's news agency. Iran will continue swiss talks. Last-minute no-show: elizabeth warren announced last night she wouldn't be coming. \" i strongly support israel, and i remain deeply concerned about the prospect of an iranian nuclear weapon, \" she said, per the boston globe. \" it's unfortunate that speaker boehner",

        "summary": "For the first time, scientists have assembled the complete genome of an electric fish — the potent south american electric eel — and in doing so have identified something much larger: exactly how this fish, along with electric fish from other families, evolved to create their jolt-delivering organ. The findings, out of universities in washington, wisconsin, and texas, touch on six lineages comprising hundreds of electric fish. They evolved separately to develop this electric organ, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution, reports phys.org. Researchers assembled genetic sequences from three other lineages to confirm that the fish used \" the same genetic tools \" — a set of about 30 genes, a researcher tells npr — to do so. \" it seems like there are limited ways to build an electric organ, \" he says. \" and that's sort of a surprising finding... You wouldn't necessarily have expected that. \" all muscle cells have electrical potential, but in these six lineages, certain ones evolved over millions of years into a different, larger cell known as an electrocyte, which produces far higher voltages. Those cells are arranged in the electric organ \" much like batteries stacked in series in a flashlight, \" and they fire in unison. Another researcher describes the 6-foot-long electric eel as a 6-inch fish attached to a 5-1/2-foot cattle prod. Researchers hope that, building off these findings, we some day might be able to create and embed tiny electric organs in other creatures — including humans. They could power medical devices like pacemakers, eliminating the need to have a battery do so.",

        "summary": "Family members of a teenage inmate in georgia say they're horrified by an assault that ended up on facebook — and by the fact they might not have known about it otherwise. The photo taken at al burruss correctional training center shows two young men standing over a crouched cortez berry, who has a swollen eye and is being held on a makeshift leash, reports the new york daily news. The caption says \" wen yhu disrespect da nation.. It bringz nuthin but pain &amp; sufferingg.. #wedntgettired #gdfolk, \" an apparent reference to the gang known as gangster disciples, or gd nation. Berry's aunt tells nbc news he was attacked on friday, the day before he turned 18, by inmates who tried to get him to join the gang before he was moved to the adult part of the facility. Berry is in prison for violating probation after a carjacking when he was 14. The aunt tells nbc that after the family saw the shocking picture, they could not get through to the facility by phone, and when she went there in person, officials were not aware he had been attacked. A georgia department of corrections spokeswoman tells the augusta chronicle that the incident is under investigation and that cellphones — a \" nationwide issue \" in prisons — are contraband that facilities use body scanners to detect. Berry has now been transferred to smith state prison, and his mother tells nbc she fears for his life at the notoriously violent facility. The photo of him has \" been all over social media, because the world has seen it, \" she says. \" so if they have cellphones in that prison, they have seen it. I ' m afraid they might kill him. \" ( inmates also use cellphones to run scams from behind bars. )",

Prosecutors announced thursday that parts from the wrong bodies had been found in 12 of 24 coffins reopened so far, including that of president lech kaczynski, which had parts from two other victims, reuters reports. It's not clear how big the body parts involved are, but they're not all tiny: authorities say the coffin of archbishop miron chodakowski held his top half and the bottom half of gen. Tadeusz ploski. The other half of ploski was in his own coffin, but it's unclear where the rest of chodakowski is. The officials were killed when their plane crashed in thick fog in western russia. The polish government says the 83 planned exhumations, which began after errors were found in forensic documents sent back with the bodies by russia, will be finished by next april, the bbc reports. The findings show that in the russian postmortems, there was \" nonchalance in the best case, and ill will in the worst case, \" says magdalena merta, widow of culture ministry official tomasz merta. The new investigation was ordered by the ruling law and justice party, which is led by jaroslaw kaczynski, twin brother of the deceased leader.

Hundreds more military personnel will serve alongside the troops as \" enablers, \" providing needed support and security, and coalition fighters are expected to add their own troops.

Between 2,100 and 3,000 troops are already in iraq training iraqi and kurdish forces, which, in combination with airstrikes, has somewhat slowed down the insurgents, defense one notes. But the us has very little on-the-ground intelligence in syria, and finding rebel fighters there who are truly moderate and not linked to extremist groups is a challenge ( though the pentagon is described by defense one as being \" confident \" it's up to the vetting task ).

Washington the u.s. Military is planning to send more than 400 soldiers to train syrian rebels to fight islamic state along with hundreds of u.s. Support personnel, a pentagon spokesman said on thursday. The training mission is expected to begin in the spring at sites outside syria, colonel steve warren said. Turkey, qatar and saudi arabia have offered to host the training. The syrian state news agency sana said the plan showed washington was \" continuing to support terrorism in syria \". Syria's government describes all of its armed opponents as terrorists. The training program is a part of u.s. President barack obama's plan to field local forces in syria to halt and eventually roll back islamic state fighters, while pounding them with airstrikes. But the insurgency in syria is now dominated by hardline sunni islamists, including both islamic state and the al qaeda-affiliated nusra front, complicating u.s. Measures to find a suitable ally on the ground. Warren did not offer additional details on the troop figures.

In addition to the trainers, the u.s. Military expects to deploy hundreds of additional u.s.

            "Rebel fighters take positions behind sand barricades at al-breij frontline, after what they said was an advance by them in al-manasher and al-majbal areas, where forces loyal to syria's president bashar al-assad were stationed, in aleppo january 5, 2015. Washington the u.s. Military is planning to send more than 400 soldiers to train syrian rebels to fight islamic state along with hundreds of u.s. Support personnel, a pentagon spokesman said on thursday. The training mission is expected to begin in the spring at sites outside syria, colonel steve warren said. Turkey, qatar and saudi arabia have offered to host the training. The syrian state news agency sana said the plan showed washington was \" continuing to support terrorism in syria \". Syria's government describes all of its armed opponents as terrorists. The training program is a part of u.s. President barack obama's plan to field local forces in syria to halt and eventually roll back islamic state fighters, while pounding them with airstrikes. But the insurgency in syria is now dominated by hardline sunni islamists, including both islamic state and the al qaeda-affiliated nusra front, complicating u.s. Measures to find a suitable ally on the ground. Warren did not offer additional details on the troop figures. The pentagon has estimated that it can train more than 5,000 recruits in the first year under a $ 500",

After months of planning, the pentagon's training mission for syria's rebels is beginning to take form. By gordon lubold the pentagon will deploy more than 400 u.s. Military trainers and hundreds more supporting personnel to four training sites in three countries as early as march as part of a long-awaited plan to help rebel forces to stabilize syria. In addition to the trainers, the u.s. Military expects to deploy hundreds of additional u.s. Military personnel as so-called enabling forces who will deploy alongside the trainers to provide security and other support at the training sites, according to senior defense officials.

Asked if the libor rate was reliable, he replied, \" i can't give that assurance with full confidence \" because the fed's reform recommendations weren't all implemented.

        "summary": "\" you're not going to hear about a weirder deal today, \" declares techcrunch after a decades-old british speaker company was bought by a tiny silicon valley startup this week. Founded in 1966, bowers &amp; wilkins boasts pages of audio products for sale. Founded in 2014, eva automation has no products to speak of. Eva solved that problem by buying bowers &amp; wilkins. The financial terms of the deal haven't been revealed, but engadget estimates it at approximately $ 175 million. Bloomberg reports the move was unusual as typically the more established company buys the new, exciting one. Eva automation's stated goal is to \" change how people interact and think about the home. \" meanwhile, bowers &amp; wilkins has lagged behind in pushing new technology, such as cloud services, in its products. As part of the deal, eva automation will take on the bowers &amp; wilkins name, keep bowers &amp; wilkins ' ceo, and continue to employ the speaker company's 1,100 workers ( eva automation employs 40 ). Eva automation founder gideon yu says he wants to start selling new speaker products next year. \"this is the way that silicon valley and other industrial companies raise the game for consumer-brand electronics, \" bloomberg quotes yu as saying. ( a \" tight-lipped \" startup is taking over palo alto. )",

Cellphone use while strolling about sent more than 1,500 people to the er in 2010, a figure that has almost tripled since 2004. Researchers expect it to hit 3,000 by 2015 — and, they say, that number doesn't come close to actual injuries, since most pedestrians don't hit up the er — or they don't cop to the cellphone use. The real figure was likely around 2 million in 2010, the atlantic reports. But even the 1,500 estimate is higher than the 1,162 injuries attributed to distracted drivers that year. \" people really cannot multitask, \" one researcher tells livescience. Some amusing examples noted in hospital case studies include, \" 28-year-old male walked into pole talking on phone and lacerated brow \" and \" 14-year-old male walking down road talking on cell phone, fell 6-8 ft. Off bridge into ditch. \" in fact, most injuries, almost 70 %, happened while people were talking on the phone as opposed to texting, which was blamed in just 9 % of the incidents. Not surprisingly, most injuries involved people under age 31.",

He explained that when he has used the figure of 100 or more, \" that means people who have gone and come back, people who have attempted to go and we locked them up, people who have gone and stayed, \" the ap reports. Comey also says the us has identified isis executioner \" jihadi john. \" in the uk, lawmakers are debating whether the country should join the anti-isis coalition, reports the bbc. Making the case for strikes, prime minister david cameron told parliament the group is a \" clear and proven threat \" to british lives and has \" already declared war on us. \" last year, parliament handed cameron a major defeat when it rejected the use of force against the assad regime. That same regime is welcoming the strikes against isis and another of its foes, the nusra front, the new york times reports. \" the us military leadership is now fighting in the same trenches with the syrian generals, in a war on terrorism inside syria, \" a syrian diplomat told a pro-regime newspaper.",

In the day's first meaningful roll call, the house used a near party-line 230-194 vote to insert changes into the measure that leaders hoped would win over unhappy republicans. These included improving medicaid benefits for some older and disabled people and abolishing coverage requirements that obamacare imposes on insurers. The gop bill would eliminate the obama statute's unpopular fines on those who do not obtain coverage and the often generous subsidies for those who purchase insurance. Friday's votes stood as the biggest vote to date for trump and for house speaker paul ryan, both aware that conservatives comprising the heart of their party's constituency were demanding no less than an all-out assault on obama's law. For trump, victory would clear an initial but crucial hurdle toward achieving the gop's lodestar quest to repeal obamacare. Defeat could weaken trump's political potency by adding a legislative failure to a resume already saddled with inquiries into his campaign's russia connections and his unfounded wiretapping allegations against obama.

Her spokeswoman, stephanie grisham, said trump will also meet harry, who founded the invictus games in 2014, inspired by the warrior games in denver he attended during a week-long visit to the u.s. In 2013. Toronto will mark the third international meet for wounded warriors, after the opening games in london in 2014 and the second edition in orlando, fla., in 2016. More than 550 wounded servicemen and women from 17 allied nations are expected to compete in toronto in such sports as archery, indoor rowing, powerlifting, sitting volleyball, swimming, and wheelchair basketball, tennis and rugby. The toronto invictus games will likely attract even more attention than usual thanks to trump's presence, but also because that is where harry's girlfriend, american actress meghan markle, lives while she is filming her legal drama, suits. Already on high alert for a possible harry-meghan engagement, the international celebrity media are hoping markle will make an appearance at the games. If so, will trump"

The \" don't serve in judge persky's court \" petition shows \" the public does not trust judge persky to deliver justice, and he should be removed from the bench, \" says a rep for women's advocacy group ultraviolet, which backed the petition along with california's courage campaign. A separate campaign has raised $ 300,000 in an effort to recall persky after he sentenced turner to six months in county jail — turner will likely serve only three — and three years of probation following a sexual assault on stanford's campus. The recall campaign can't kick off until april 3, three months into persky's next six-year term, according to california law. At that point, 80,000 signatures from santa clara county residents will be needed to call a special election. But \" if he doesn't have a jury, he can't do his job, \" the petition states. Persky already had to excuse jurors who refused to serve in his court in his first case since the turner decision; he was also pulled from another sex assault case. In an open letter published thursday, however, 18 retired santa clara county judges say persky should stay put. \" the essence of judicial independence is that judges must be able to make decisions without fear of political repercussions, \" they wrote, adding they weren't taking sides on \" whether [ turner's ] sentence was adequate or appropriate. \"",

Kalamazoo public safety officer jason gates, meanwhile, says he was just doing his job. After he pulled the woman over and approached the car saturday, he wondered for a second or two if the woman was just trying to get out of a ticket, but he quickly realized she was really choking and told her to get out of the car. Just a few firm pumps using the heimlich maneuver dislodged the food, and the woman instantly crumpled into his arms and sobbed, as gates'dash cam video captured the whole thing. \" i just feel like i did what i ' m paid to do, \" gates told reporters at police headquarters. \" i ' m glad for her that i happened to be there. \" gates said he pulled the woman over to issue a warning, not a ticket ( and he didn't give her a ticket when all was said and done ).

He said the ordeal felt lengthy, but it took less than a minute to pull her over, dislodge the food, comfort her, and ask if she wanted further medical attention, which she didn't, reports michigan live.

But reality in the swiss business world may not be in keeping with what reuters calls the country's \" picture postcard image, \" especially after a recent string of suicides among top executives there. Martin senn, the ex-ceo of zurich insurance, killed himself last week, per the ap, just three years after the company's cfo, pierre wauthier, also died by his own hand. The head of swisscom telecommunications firm also killed himself in 2013, as did the chief of julius baer bank in 2008. And while stats from a 2014 world health organization report don't indicate runaway suicide rates in switzerland — the report puts the country squarely in the midrange of suicide rates among european nations — some entrenched in the swiss business world have noted the stresses that may proliferate in the managerial arena. \" if you fail, you are expected to excuse yourself from the conversation and drop any further ambitions, \" one entrepreneur tells reuters. \" you're not expected to show your face again. \" those stresses may arise from a desire to retain switzerland's conservative traditions, often at odds with the pressure of investor demands, a sluggish world economy, and ever-changing regulations. \" whenever i ask people in the financial sector how they feel, they answer: ' i am tired, ' \" a professor at the imd business school says. In wauthier's case, his suicide note pointed the finger at then-zurich ceo josef ackermann, who some claimed had tried to ditch the insurance giant's conservative foundation and pressured managers to get riskier in investments. Ackermann resigned in 2013 due to the backlash from wauthier's suicide. Other medical experts say businesspeople at the top may not cope well with leaving their firms, as in the case of senn's sudden departure six months ago. \" top people who lose their jobs often fall into a deep hole, \" the director of a swiss workers ' association tells swiss radio international. \" it is difficult to define their life beyond their profession, their function, [ their ] status. \" ( to help others, a college president revealed his own suicide attempts. )",

A police officer spotted the 57-year-old con man in the illegal shack on shadow mountain in september — he may have been living there for up to a year — but hogue escaped out a window, the aspen times reports. He was arrested weeks later after being spotted trying to build a new cabin. Authorities say he had stolen ski gear and $ 17,000 in cash in his car. On monday, hogue pleaded guilty to felony theft and felony possession of burglary tools. He's facing up to three years in prison and is scheduled to be sentenced next month. Hogue first made headlines when at the age of 26 he posed as a high school student in palo alto.

Hogue went on to pose as a student at princeton while in his early 30s.

Hogue was also busted for stealing $ 50,000 in jewels from a harvard museum while working as a guard in the early ' 90s and went to prison in 2007 for burglarizing around 7,000 items from homes in colorado.

President obama has blamed republican obstruction for the looming rate increase; mitt romney says the lower rate should be extended but hasn't specified how to pay for it. But the partisan posturing is a distraction from far more pressing issues that face students and parents who must borrow to cover their college costs. What's lost is how congress, in numerous ways, has been hurting the most vulnerable college students and dithering on the crisis of college affordability. The stafford debate is more rhetoric than substance. If the rate on the subsidized stafford loan program does double, as scheduled, to 6.8 percent this summer, very little will happen. In fact, students who borrow through this program will ultimately end up paying only about $ 6 a month extra for one year of loans. And the rate increase won't affect previous loans, only new loans borrowed for the 2012-13 school year. Let's look more closely at what's on the table. The proposals that congress has been debating would extend the 3.4 percent interest rate for only one year. If a student borrowed the average subsidized stafford loan",
            "What few observers seem to appreciate is that the low rate of 3.4 percent took effect only last july. As recently as 2007, the rate was 6.8 percent. The democrats made reducing the interest rate on student loans into a winning campaign issue in 2006 and they fulfilled their campaign promise by ushering through the college cost reduction and access act of 2007, which gradually reduced the subsidized stafford rate over a four-year period. Congress often passes this sort of legislation with a 5- or 10-year window, so it's reasonable to ask whether this political battle was anticipated by congressional democrats, who knew they would gain political brownie points if the republicans, in the months preceding a presidential election, balked at extending the low rate. ( each party has added conditions to the rate extension that are unacceptable to the other side. Republicans want to pay for a one-year extension on the lower stafford rate by taking $ 6 billion out of the preventive health care fund established by the 2010 health care legislation; democrats want to cover the tab by cutting oil subsidies and closing a corporate tax loophole. ) it's true that a very high percentage of students who graduate with debt hold a subsidized stafford loan: 70 percent come from families who make less than $ 50,000; 24 percent from families with incomes between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000"

In fact, students who borrow through this program will ultimately end up paying only about $ 6 a month extra for one year of loans. And the rate increase won't affect previous loans, only new loans borrowed for the 2012-13 school year. Let's look more closely at what's on the table. The proposals that congress has been debating would extend the 3.4 percent interest rate for only one year. If a student borrowed the average subsidized stafford loan",
            "What few observers seem to appreciate is that the low rate of 3.4 percent took effect only last july. As recently as 2007, the rate was 6.8 percent. The democrats made reducing the interest rate on student loans into a winning campaign issue in 2006 and they fulfilled their campaign promise by ushering through the college cost reduction and access act of 2007, which gradually reduced the subsidized stafford rate over a four-year period. Congress often passes this sort of legislation with a 5- or 10-year window, so it's reasonable to ask whether this political battle was anticipated by congressional democrats, who knew they would gain political brownie points if the republicans, in the months preceding a presidential election, balked at extending the low rate. ( each party has added conditions to the rate extension that are unacceptable to the other side. Republicans want to pay for a one-year extension on the lower stafford rate by taking $ 6 billion out of the preventive health care fund established by the 2010 health care legislation; democrats want to cover the tab by cutting oil subsidies and closing a corporate tax loophole. ) it's true that a very high percentage of students who graduate with debt hold a subsidized stafford loan: 70 percent come from families who make less than $ 50,000; 24 percent from families with incomes between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000"

        "summary": "When a group of student computer scientists decided to test their hypothesis that software coding done by women doesn't get as much cred as that done by males, they came face to face with a couple of surprises. In the not-yet-peer-reviewed study published in the open-access peerj journal, researchers reviewed data culled from the github, a giant open-source software hive that's faced its own accusations of sexism. The scientists found that out of 3 million \" pull requests ( when a developer writes code for someone else's project ), developers more readily accepted code written by women ( 78.6 % ) than that written by men ( 74.6 % ), per the guardian. The researchers eliminated a number of factors that could be clouding the data, such as females perhaps making tinier code adjustments that project owners could more quickly evaluate. But what the scientists found next somewhat dulled the equality euphoria. They wanted to see if women coders were reaping the benefits of reverse gender bias, perhaps getting more approvals in efforts to promote diversity — instead, they found the opposite. In separating women developers into those whose profiles clearly ided them as women and those whose didn't ( and looking only at \" outsiders, \" which excludes project owners and collaborators ), the acceptance rate for gender-neutral profiles was 71.8 % to female profiles ' 62.5 %. But some developers say finding gender bias within github is more involved than simply adding up the numbers: a pull request could also be passed over because the potential recipient was simply swamped or opted to accept the work of a developer he or she knew.",

As one of the men recorded the encounter on his phone, barone said, \" if anybody wants to fight or run, i ' m a little trigger happy guys, i ' m not gonna lie. \" the video went viral, and a month later, the city released a second video in which barone can be heard explaining why it would be inconvenient if he had to fire his weapon, noting that if he did so, he would be ineligible for overtime and would have to \" move from my nice house. \" barone, a 10-year department veteran, said during the internal affairs review that his statements were \" effective in maintaining control, \" but that he could have chosen \" better \" words and that he regretted \" how this is being portrayed \" in the media. Critics said the incident highlights the mistrust between hartford's mostly white police department and the city's population, which is 84 % nonwhite, but police investigators ultimately decided barone did not violate the civil rights of the men, who were mostly black and hispanic. Critics also pointed out that just 7 % of hartford pd officers live in the city; among barone's other filmed comments, he noted at one point that only \" junkies \" come to hartford from the wealthy suburb of glastonbury, where he lives. Barone can appeal his firing. Wfsb has the aclu's response to his termination; the statement says, among other things, \" hartford's overall lack of police accountability guarantees a bad system, not just bad apples. \"",

The new statistics come from the cdc, which found the average american man now weighs 195.7 pounds — 15 pounds more than in the late ' 80s and early ' 90s — and the average american woman now weighs 168.5 pounds — up 16 pounds over the past 20 years, according to time. Live science reports the cdc also found that waistlines were increasing over that time span. And nj.com points out that the increase puts the bmi of the average man ( 28.9 ) and average woman ( 28.8 ) near the official obesity level of 30. The cdc found the average american man is 5-feet-9-inches tall, and the average american woman is 5-feet-4-inches tall. Those heights are unchanged over the past two decades. However, average 11-year-old boys are now an inch taller ( and 13.5 pounds heavier ). The largest weight gains between now and then were seen in men between the ages of 60 and 69 and women between 20 and 29. The cdc's report didn't give reasons for the increase in weight, but an expert who describes it as a \" fairly rapid rate \" of weight gain, tells healthday that less exercise and more calorie-heavy foods are to blame.

        "summary": "A swim team's trip to san diego went horribly wrong tuesday, and lifeguards ended up having to rescue almost two dozen high school students from the water at la jolla cove, nbc san diego reports. The teenagers were in san diego to compete in a long-distance swim, and 64 of them ( plus three coaches ) went in the water against the advice of lifeguards, says sgt. Ed harris of san diego lifeguards, explaining that it was windy at the beach, the waves were two to four feet high, and the water was about 59 degrees. When the group was about half a mile from shore, some swimmers started panicking, which triggered others to panic, and \" it just snowballed into a mass rescue, \" harris says. Ultimately, 22 students were pulled out of the water by lifeguards on surfboards, jet skis, and boats, abc news reports. A 16-year-old girl who had swallowed some water was unconscious and beginning to show signs of hypothermia; she was taken to a local hospital but was expected to be released, the san diego union-tribune reports. The teens attend rancho verde high school, about 88 miles north of la jolla; a rep from the school district says they were briefed on ocean swimming by a lifeguard before entering the water, but the lifeguards say their advice was to delay the swim. \" you can be the strongest swimmer in a pool and not be used to chop in your face, not to be used to the cold water when you go from 76-degree pool to 59-degree ocean, \" a san diego lifeguard explains.",

            "In the merry-go-round of gop presidential politics, is it about to be newt gingrich's time to take a turn as a frontrunner? recent polls suggest that he's on the way up, currently in a respectable third place behind an embattled herman cain and a tepidly-supported mitt romney. Perhaps more importantly, gingrich is escalating his use of over-the-top rhetoric that will get him more attention, as he did this weekend when he likened president obama to convicted ponzi schemer bernie madoff. The comment came during a lincoln-douglas-style debate that gingrich shared with herman cain, which proved to be more of a media circus than meaningful debate due to cain's recent sexual harassment allegations. In fact, the most noteworthy item that came from the debate was cain's blasting of the press for asking questions about the scandal surrounding him. Gingrich drew a predictably unfavorable comparison between gop saint ronald reagan and the current sitting president, though the metaphor was more focused on their respective rhetoric: we have today a president and ….compare him to ronald reagan who told the truth — great book called \"the education of ronald reagan \" on lessons he learned at general electric — compare reagan's ability to talk directly to the american people, make sense and have the american people move the congress with the current president. This president is about as candid and accurate as bernie madoff in what he tells the american people. Now that's hyperbole! it's easy to dismiss this sort of over-the-top political rhetoric as poetic license, but comparing president obama with a convicted felon who bilked millions of individual investors with lies and deceit will likely only resonate with voters who have already long decided that obama is the worst president ever™ no matter what evidence is presented to them, one way or",
            "Was it a thoughtful pause or an indication that herman cain may not know as much about medicare as a presidential hopeful should? that's just one question that arose in the wake of this weekend's debate between cain and former house speaker newt gingrich. At one point during the evening, americans for prosperity texas chairman ben streusand asked cain whether he favored a \"defined benefit plan \" or \"premium support \" when it comes to medicare. Cain repeated the question to himself while looking upward and appearing to mull it over, later turning it over to gingrich to answer first. Related: gingrich: obama is as accurate as bernie madoff in what he says to american people \"that's only fair, \" joked gingrich, as audience members laughed. Have a look for yourselves, via c-span.

But because the decision involves two different states and pending appeals, thing get convoluted in the way that only gay-marriage cases can. In today's court hearing, broward judge dale cohen dissolved the marriage of heather brassner and megan lade, who were joined in a 2002 civil union in vermont. Brassner says she hasn't seen lade for several years and filed for divorce in absentia. But \" the court needed to recognize the relationship as an out-of-state civil union first, in order to grant it, \" explains the local new times. \" this meant cohen had to weigh in on florida's same-sex marriage ban. \" he did so, declaring the ban unconstitutional in august and then again, because of a legal technicality, on dec. 8, reports the miami herald. The divorce hearing followed today. \" this is a historic day, \" says brassner attorney nancy brodzki. \" this is the first divorce for a same-sex couple. It will not be the last divorce. \" brodzki, though, expects florida attorney general pam bondi to appeal. And this is separate from a case on the federal level in which a judge declared the same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional but put a stay in place until jan. 5. Supreme court justice clarence thomas, who handles appeals in this region, will decide before then whether the stay will be extended.",

But the dyes used in the scan could harm the baby, meaning she'd need to end the pregnancy before undergoing the procedure. Joice opted to continue with her pregnancy but began having trouble breathing in her third trimester; an x-ray revealed tumors in her lungs. Jan. 23 brought both joy and devastation. Joice had a baby girl, lily, via c-section, but \" there were tons of tumor[ s ], \" her doctor tells abc news. \" it had spread all over her abdomen. \" tumors were also found in joice's heart and pelvis.

Researchers found that participants who took in all their daily calories between 8am and 2pm burned 6 % more fat than those who spread out their calorie intake from 8am to 8pm, livescience reports. The two groups ate the same meals, the sydney morning herald reports. \" your body's fat-burning ability peaks after you've been fasting for 12 to 14 hours, \" the lead author of the study explains. That's because, for the first 12 hours of fasting, your body burns glycogen ( a molecule that stores sugar ). After 12 hours, it starts to burn fat stores. However, researchers don't consider the 6 % difference statistically significant, which is why the results are considered preliminary until further research is done. The study also found that those who ate during a 6-hour window experienced more stable hunger levels than those in the 12-hour group. Participants rated their hunger from 0 to 100; average hunger levels were the same, but the 6-hour group experienced fewer hunger swings — their hunger levels did not vary as much ( 12 fewer points of variance ) as the 12-hour group's levels. The lead researcher says it's not clear why, but it could be due to the fact that those in the 12-hour group had only consumed two-thirds of their daily intake earlier in the day, prior to dinner, and \" that might set you up more for binges or unhealthy eating than if you've already eaten all of your food for the day. \" the researchers caution that children and pregnant women must avoid fasting, and anyone with a chronic health condition must ask a doctor first.

It also improved metabolic flexibility, which is the body's ability to switch between burning carbs and fats. \" eating only during a much smaller window of time than people are typically used to may help with weight loss, \" said courtney peterson, phd, who led the study at pennington biomedical research centre. \" we found that eating between 8am and 2pm followed by an 18-hour daily fast kept appetite levels more even throughout the day, in comparison to eating between 8am and 8pm. \" the results may be because the earlier eating times aligned with the circadian rhythm, the researchers hyopthesised.

The study found that when participants consumed all of their calories within a 6-hour window, from 8 a.m. To 2 p.m., they burned 6 percent more fat and had more stable hunger levels than participants who consumed the same amount of calories within a 12-hour window, from 8 a.m. To 8 p.m. \" it kind of makes sense, \" said courtney peterson, lead author of the study and an assistant professor in the department of nutrition sciences at the university of alabama at birmingham. \" your body's fat-burning ability peaks after you've been fasting for 12 to 14 hours. \" for up to 12 hours after the start of a fast, the body is still burning glycogen, a molecule that stores glucose ( or sugar ). After 12 hours, the body begins burning fat stores, peterson said. [ dieters, beware: 9 myths that can make you fat ] however, peterson cautioned that burning 6 percent more fat did not meet the researchers ' criteria for a meaningful difference between the groups.

At first, they were \" white british children \" and more recently, they were pakistani, kashmiri, and roma, the ap reports. A new report reveals they were victims of a disturbing, and largely ignored, sex-abuse ring. \" children … had been doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight, threatened with guns, made to witness brutally violent rapes and threatened they would be next if they told anyone, \" writes professor alexis jay in a report commissioned by the town to investigate the claims of abuse. \" girls as young as 11 were raped by large numbers of male perpetrators. \" police regarded the kids with \" contempt, \" a third of whom were already known to them and child protection agencies, writes jay. The abuse started in 1997. In 2010, five rotherham men were jailed for grooming teens for sex, and similar rings were uncovered in three more towns. No other arrests were made. In 2012, an investigation by the times of london newspaper revealed that police and child protection agencies knew about the abuse for a decade, including formally in three reports, according to the guardian. Town council members say the data was kept from them. Political correctness may have also prevented action — the perpetrators were believed to be pakistani, and authorities may have feared that targeting one ethnic group would be seen as racist, explains ap. \" the collective failures of political and officer leadership were blatant, \" jay writes. So far, 29 people have been charged with child sexual abuse, reports the bbc. The number of convictions is unclear.",
