The mississippi teen, sarah kavanagh, led the charge with two change.org petitions against brominated vegetable oil — one targeting powerade, the other gatorade — that gathered nearly 260,000 supporters in all, the ap reports. Pepsico agreed to pull bvo from gatorade last year, and now powerade bottles in strawberry lemonade and fruit punch flavors in several cities don't have the ingredient listed. Some bottles still list it, and coca-cola said today that powerade is \" bvo-free, \" so it seems the company is phasing it out. Just what is bvo? according to the fda, it's used in fruit-flavored drinks as a stabilizer for flavoring oils. But bromine is a patented flame retardant that's banned in the european union and japan, and may be harmful to anyone who drinks it in large amounts, the telegram reports. Coca-cola and pepsico aren't the only companies under pressure from petitions: subway yanked an fda-approved ingredient known as the \" yoga mat chemical \" from its breads earlier this year when a petitioner at foodbabe.com challenged the company's healthy-food image.",

        "summary": "An escaped lion, a taunting crowd, and an ill-prepared first-response team came together in kenya to cause what some are saying was the unnecessary, senseless death of the lion, the country's star reports. Mohawk, a 13-year-old lion who was one of nairobi national park's most well-known creatures due to his trademark mane and rep as somewhat of a \" ladies ' lion, \" had escaped from an unfenced section of the park and ended up in the town of isinya, where he was promptly surrounded by a jeering group of men, the washington post reports. Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd — kenya wildlife service officials tell the ap about 400 had surrounded him — and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs — so they unleashed what the star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \" roaring and writhing in pain \" as he died. \" if the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died, \" a local resident tells the paper. \" you can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act. \" the shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #justiceformohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \" this action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety, \" the kenya wildlife service says, per cnn.

Eusebio felix was put on leave from his job for telling peruvians last month that four suspected murderers apprehended by police were \" pishtacos \" — the legendary killers who roam the andes mountains extracting fat from travelers. In the legend, the pishtacos strung-up the torsos of their victims above candles and heated them to collect fat. Police initially said the gang murdered up to 60 victims and exported their fat for thousands of dollars a liter to italian cosmetics makers. In the end, there may have been only one victim. When they announced their big find, police held a news conference and displayed what they said was human fat stored in an empty bottle of inca kola, the electric-yellow soft drink popular in the andes. They also showed a video of police pulling body parts from a shallow grave at a house in the mountainous region of huanuco.

        "summary": "Scientists have discovered a new virus apparently transmitted through blood transfusions. Little else is known about human hepegivirus-1, or hhpgv-1, besides that it looks a bit like hepatitis c and the harmless and perhaps beneficial human pegivirus. \" it is the first transfusion-associated virus that's been described in a long time, \" a researcher tells nbc news. He adds \" we don't know if it is going to be a significant cause of human hepatitis, \" but scientists say it's unlikely. In fact, \" it may be good for you. \" they first found the virus in blood samples from two volunteers, part of a study of 46, who received blood transfusions to treat hemophilia between 1974 and 1980. The virus only appeared after transfusions, but both patients cleared it and showed no sign of disease. Two more cases were found among 106 who'd received plasma, per mbio; both cleared the virus, though one was infected for five years. Even if the virus is harmful, researchers say there's no need to panic. \" this is not sars. This is not mers. This is not hiv, \" says an expert. Whereas blood transfusions were once performed solely with human blood products, they now use genetically engineered products. Plus, blood is screened more carefully and stricter policies better control who donates blood compared to 25 years ago. \" does it cause trouble that would justify any response with blood safety? i don't think we're at that level, \" a pathologist at the blood systems research institute tells science. Scientists have yet to isolate the virus but say the next step is to develop an antibody test to find hhpgv-1 in a larger population. Afterward, experts can determine whether those with hhpgv-1 antibodies appear less healthy than those without the virus and look for links to disease. ( a study suggests the seeds of alzheimer's may pass through blood. )",

He has built an empire on such moments. It felt too perfect, too scripted, even by the standards of storytelling that white has inspired. The crowd hushed in anticipation of another command performance. White sped down the hill and crested the leading edge of the massive halfpipe and began what was sure to be a monumental run. And that is when it happened — a hard landing here, a gasp-inducing bobble there, the dominance of the world's greatest halfpipe snowboarder slipping away with each diagonal weave downhill. White ended up in fourth, a placing probably higher than he deserved, ceding the olympic throne to someone else for the first time since 2002. \"for me to be remembered in the sport, i don't think tonight makes or breaks my career, \" white said. \"i've been snowboarding for so long, and i love it so much, that i ' m happy to take this for what it is and move on and continue to ride. \" continue reading the main story slide show it was iouri podladtchikov of switzerland — i-pod to his friends — who won the gold medal by doing",

        "summary": "When covering the story four years ago, newser's headline read, \" $ 7.5m bitcoin fortune buried in landfill. \" that fortune ended up in a welsh landfill after james howells threw out a hard drive over that summer while cleaning up his workspace. On it was the cryptographic \" private key \" he needed to access his 7,500 bitcoins — which are now worth far, far more. With bitcoin valued at roughly $ 17,000 as of wednesday, those 7,500 lost bitcoins are worth more than $ 127 million, reports cnbc. He tells the telegraph that he hasn't \" sat here crying about it, accidents happen. \" but that hasn't deterred him from hoping he ' ll one day get to go searching at the newport landfill, something the newport city council currently won't allow. It would be a novel undertaking: \" a landfill has never been excavated in the uk before \" for non-criminal reasons, he says, \" so we're in uncharted territory with regards to regulations, local authorities and environmental agencies. \" and there are plenty of risks, from deadly gases to the possibility of landfill fires, not to mention the cost. But \" the higher the value goes, the more chance i have to recover it, \" he says. Wired spoke with a rep from the city council, and the upshot isn't too optimistic, with the rep citing the huge costs of doing the excavating and storing the waste, plus the \" huge environmental impact on the surrounding area \" — and after all that, the hard drive might not be found or usable, though howells has brushed off naysayers who argue the drive would be destroyed by corrosion at this point.

        "summary": "The keystone state, which set sail in 1849 as one of the largest and most luxurious steamer ships of its time, sank during a november storm in 1861 with 33 people aboard. No one knew its fate for more than a week, until debris was spotted, and it's been lost since then — until now. A shipwreck hunter found it at the bottom of lake huron, 40 to 50 miles from where it was last seen and far from where david trotter expected to find it. Some historians say the ship may have been secretly hauling civil war supplies when it sank, the detroit free press reports — and there are even rumors it may have been carrying gold, according to michigan live. By 1857, after an economic downturn and the rise of the railroad, many ships like the keystone state were considered too pricey to operate. By 1861, however, thanks to the civil war, the keystone state had been taken out of storage and refurbished. It picked up its cargo in detroit — officially, farm implements, hardware, and grain, but \" it was an emergency shipment, \" a historian explains; he adds that typically a ship wouldn't have made a trip like that so late in the year. Also suspect: the ship wasn't carrying any lifeboats ( everyone aboard died in the wreck ), which could indicate it left in a hurry. Trotter's team found her using side-scan sonar in july, and has since made 30 dives at the site — which turned up no gold or cargo. Some speculate that the crew dumped the cargo in a bid to save the ship. ( another ship was found this year in lake superior. )",

            "Lake huron — the civil war was only seven months old on nov. 9, 1861, when the sidewheel steamer keystone state passed into oblivion. Nobody even knew the ship had sunk until more than a week later, when wreckage was spotted off port austin and the keystone state's wheelhouse washed ashore. Since then, the ship has remained one of the many great lakes shipwreck mysteries; a tragedy that claimed the life of 33 crew members and sparked rumors about a clandestine cargo load of gold and war materials. This year, part of the mystery has been solved. On monday, dec. 9, shipwreck hunter david trotter announced the discovery of the keystone state in lake huron, about 50 miles north of michigan's thumb in less than 200 feet of water. \"she wasn't where she was supposed to be, \" said trotter, an avid shipwreck sleuth with more than 100 discoveries to his name. \"i probably thought i'd never find her. \" trotter's undersea research associates team discovered the wreck in july using side-scan sonar and has since made several dozen dives to document the site and attempt to answer questions about the ship's mysterious cargo, which some believe was intentionally mislabeled on the manifest. The 288-foot-long keystone state, luxurious for her day, was the second largest ship on the great lakes when she was launched in 1849 and is one of the largest side-wheel steamers to disappear into their depths. The ship was bound for milwaukee, wis., when she left detroit on nov. 8, 1861, carrying what was labeled \"iron implements, \" or farm machinery, on the cargo manifest. Since the sinking, rumors have persisted that the keystone state was actually carrying military supplies destined for the battlefield. A cargo of farm machinery in november on a special run — the ship normally moved between detroit and buffalo, n.y. — invites a natural suspicion, trotter said. \"farm implements are not heavily used in the winter, \" he said. Unfortunately, trotter's team found an empty cargo hold. The reason probably",

On monday, dec. 9, shipwreck hunter david trotter announced the discovery of the keystone state in lake huron, about 50 miles north of michigan's thumb in less than 200 feet of water. \"she wasn't where she was supposed to be, \" said trotter, an avid shipwreck sleuth with more than 100 discoveries to his name. \"i probably thought i'd never find her. \" trotter's undersea research associates team discovered the wreck in july using side-scan sonar and has since made several dozen dives to document the site and attempt to answer questions about the ship's mysterious cargo, which some believe was intentionally mislabeled on the manifest. The 288-foot-long keystone state, luxurious for her day, was the second largest ship on the great lakes when she was launched in 1849 and is one of the largest side-wheel steamers to disappear into their depths. The ship was bound for milwaukee, wis., when she left detroit on nov. 8, 1861, carrying what was labeled \"iron implements, \" or farm machinery, on the cargo manifest. Since the sinking, rumors have persisted that the keystone state was actually carrying military supplies destined for the battlefield. A cargo of farm machinery in november on a special run — the ship normally moved between detroit and buffalo, n.y. — invites a natural suspicion, trotter said. \"farm implements are not heavily used in the winter, \" he said. Unfortunately, trotter's team found an empty cargo hold. The reason probably",

As the search off the coast of florida continues, family members say the boys may have crafted a flotation device using items including life jackets, an engine cover, and a cooler that were missing from their single-engine fishing boat, usa today reports. Relatives and neighbors say the boys, like others in their palm beach county neighborhood, are experienced sailors and have been around boats their entire lives, reports the palm beach post. A coast guard spokesman says the search is continuing \" aggressively \" and the water is warm enough that the teens, who were last seen on friday, could survive for four or five days, the post reports. Because of currents, search efforts are focusing on the area north of where the boat was found near daytona beach, though they could be hard to spot, the spokesman says. \" when a person is in the water, you're basically looking for the chest up, so it's a relatively small object you're looking for, \" he says. \" it's a challenging environment. \" the families have urged people from palm beach to the coast of georgia to look for clues that might have washed up, especially the yamaha engine cover and yeti cooler, nbc news reports.",

Here's a sampling: wall street journal: the newspaper's editorial sounds fed up with everybody involved, blaming the left for initially exploiting the colin kaepernick situation, then trump for exploiting the blowback. It adds that players who kneel shouldn't be surprised to hear boos, because \" disrespecting the national anthem puts partisanship above a symbol of nationhood that thousands have died for. \" but ultimately, the real losers in all this \" are the millions of americans who would rather cheer for their teams on sunday as a respite from work and the other divisions of american life. \" daily caller: in a column, scott greer writes that trump seems to be relishing his role as an \" oval office culture warrior, \" perhaps because his legislative agenda keeps hitting roadblocks. This fight may pay off: \" in the fight over kneeling, trump is facing off against out-of-touch athletes who appear to be opposing the flag and the troops. Espn and most political pundits may think he is a dummy for engaging in this fight, but if [ the ] nfl continues to lose fans over it, trump will come out as the victor. \" new york times: its editorial pits trump as the villain here and kaepernick as the hero of sorts. The qb still can't find a team, but the weekend protests \" might well have been a huge victory for free speech and the cause of racial justice he has so bravely espoused. \" the editorial gives the last word to lebron james, who tweeted of trump that \" going to white house was a great honor until you showed up! \" washington post: the editors don't care what trump thinks of kaepernick. But \" when his response to protest is to question patriotism rather than engage on the issue of unequal policing — then it is mr. Trump who'disrespects our flag &amp; our country. ' \" usa today: its editorial faults trump as \" divider in chief \" and says his use of the presidential bully pulpit to fault those exercising their right to dissent is \" simply indecent. \" but an op-ed at the newspaper by former nebraska congressman jon christensen praises trump's move. \" when millionaire athletes refuse to honor america and pay homage to the men and women who died for our freedom, and instead, choose to use their field of occupation to make a statement, then i can choose to turn the channel. \" they do indeed deserve to be fired, he adds.",

He marked the joker's april 25, 1940, comic book debut by tweeting the first image released of jared leto as joker, the role he's playing in the film. It's a joker complete with green hair, crimson lips, nasty teeth, and a tattoo-heavy body. Among the ink: \" ha \" repeated over and over, and a cursive \" damaged \" on the forehead. Rolling stone reports the look was inspired by batman: the killing joke, and points out that it's not the first time ayer has referenced alan moore's graphic novel. That leads the magazine to speculate that leto's turn as the joker in the film — due aug. 5, 2016 — will hew closer to moore's joker, a bust-of-a-stand-up comic who is disfigured and goes crazy in the span of a single day. Usa today also calls out a harlequin skull tattoo on leto's chest, which it sees as \" most likely an ode to his suicide squad girlfriend harley quinn. \" she's played by margot robbie. The rest of the big-name cast includes will smith as deadshot, viola davis as amanda waller, cara delevingne as enchantress, and joel kinnaman as rick flagg.

            "When british prime minister david cameron visits president barack obama this week, one detail may stay bottled up: the labels on the wines the white house pours at the state dinner tomorrow night. For obama's first three state dinners, honoring the leaders of india, mexico and china, the white house released the name, year and appellation of wines -- all-american -- paired with each course. Part of a tradition observed by previous presidents, including george w. Bush, that disclosure stopped after obama's dinner last year for chinese president hu jintao. One of the wines served on jan. 19, 2011, was a top-rated 2005 cabernet sauvignon from washington state that originally sold for $ 115 a bottle and went for as much as $ 399 by the time of the dinner. The price the white house paid per bottle was not made public. At the next state dinner, on june 7, 2011, for german chancellor angela merkel, the menu made public by the white house didn't include details on the wines. \"an american wine will be paired with each course, \" stated a note at the bottom of the menu released by the white house.

        "summary": "\" pachyderms have lost a great champion. \" that's the tribute of one elephant expert for esmond bradley martin, one of the world's most well-known ivory investigators, who was found killed in his home in nairobi, kenya, per the telegraph and bbc. The 75-year-old had a stab wound to his neck, and investigators believe his death was the result of a robbery gone wrong. His wife says she went out for a nature walk and discovered his body upon returning home around 4pm sunday, per the star. Bradley martin, identifiable by a colorful handkerchief he often had peeking out of his jacket pocket, was a major figure within the wildlife conservation movement who'd risen to prominence by going undercover, usually posing as a buyer, to expose the illegal market for ivory and rhino horn. A former un special envoy for rhino conservation, bradley martin began his efforts in earnest in the 1970s, when the number of elephants being slaughtered for their ivory spiked. That's when he left the us for kenya, and his work helped put an end to the sales of rhino horn and ivory in china. His travels also took him to vietnam and laos, where last year he and another researcher revealed the latter country's ivory trade was the fastest growing in the world. Their work there involved the dangerous ploy of pretending they were buyers and staying in a casino frequented by organized-crime members and traffickers, all so they could find out what the going price for ivory was. Local police say they've already questioned a cook and gardener at bradley martin's home and have come up empty so far on suspects.",

        "summary": "Facts and numbers were flying in last night's debate, and president obama and mitt romney agreed on so few of them that \" the two men seemed to be inhabiting two parallel universes, \" politico observes. Thankfully, a swarm of fact-checkers have been poring over the candidates'statements to sort things out. Here are some of the more egregious fibs: romney: \" i won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. \" independent analysis indicates that romney's tax plan would add $ 5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Romney says he ' ll pay for that by reducing deductions and credits, but the tax policy center concluded that was \" mathematically impossible. \" obama: \" we've made some adjustments \" to simpson-bowles. Obama's plan is not, as he implied, comparable to simpson-bowles. It's much less aggressive, doesn't touch social security, and, while it too reduces the deficit by $ 4 trillion, it takes an extra year to do it. Romney on green energy loan recipients: \" i think about half have gone out of business. \" try three out of 26. Romney: dodd-frank \" designates a number of banks as too big to fail. \" the law designates some banks for special treatment, but that treatment involves extra regulation and a way to liquidate them if they run into trouble; they are not, as romney argued \" effectively guaranteed by the federal government. \" romney: \" pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan. \" romney's health care plan only covers people with pre-existing conditions if they \" maintain continuous coverage, \" which was more or less the situation before obamacare. Obama: \" under governor romney's definition … donald trump is a small business. \" romney's plan doesn't actually define small businesses. But the federal government does, and under its guidelines, trump is a small business, because he owns some businesses with fewer than 500 employees, according to cnn. Obama: \" i've put forward a specific $ 4 trillion deficit reduction plan. \" true, but that plan counts savings already agreed on during the debt ceiling debate. Romney: \" the president said he'd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. \" when obama took office, the projected deficit for 2009 was $ 1.2 trillion. For fiscal 2012, the deficit is expected to be $ 1.1 trillion, the new york times reports.",

Four members of the wagner family were arrested tuesday, and authorities say a custody dispute played a role in the murders, the ap reports. Edward \" jake \" wagner, now 26, was the ex-boyfriend of hanna rhoden, 19, who was killed while lying in bed with her 4-day-old baby girl. Wagner was not the newborn's father, but shared custody of another daughter, sophia, now 5, with rhoden. Sophia was not with her mother when she was murdered; the newborn as well as two of her young cousins who were present were not hurt. ( this chart shows how all the victims were related. ) also arrested, per cincinnati.com: wagner's parents george \" billy \" wagner iii, 47, and angela wagner, 48, and his brother george wagner iv, 27. All four have been charged with eight counts of aggravated murder and also face a slew of other charges. The mothers of both elder wagners were also arrested and accused of forging custody documents in an alleged cover-up of the crimes. Citing a \" fixation \" and \" obsession \" the wagner family allegedly had with the custody situation, ohio attorney general mike dewine said tuesday the situation is \" the most bizarre story i've ever seen. It's just amazing. \" authorities say the wagners knew the rhodens well and spent months studying their routines and the layouts of their homes. But the wagners have long denied involvement and insisted they were close friends with the rhodens; they moved to alaska after the killings due, they said, to intense speculation over their possible involvement in the case. \" sophia is getting older, \" jake wagner ( who also set up a gofundme for custody-related legal bills in the wake of the massacre ) said at the time, so they moved \" so she wouldn't hear it. \" they were arrested, however, in ohio and kentucky.

Popular science highlights one \" grain of salt \" aspect of the study: it was small, with just six participants, and it did not have a placebo group.

But now research is suggesting that eating peanuts and tree nuts like almonds, cashews, and walnuts are linked to lower mortality rates, per a maastricht university press release. The study, published online today in the international journal of epidemiology, found that both men and women who ate at least 10 grams of peanuts or nuts daily saw a reduced risk of dying from not only heart disease, but also from respiratory illnesses, cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. The only disappointing result, expressed in the saddest sentence you may read all week: \" [ the study ] finds no protective effect for peanut butter. \" the press release notes that the health benefits of peanuts and nuts are probably due to what they're harboring inside their shells: an amalgam of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats ( the so-called \" good \" fats ), fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and other compounds. And it's not like you have to go overboard in your nut-eating habits: researchers in the maastricht university study found that eating more than an average 15 grams per day — or half a handful — didn't confer any lower mortality risk. So what gives with peanut butter, which ostensibly contains those same ingredients? researchers speculate it's all the other stuff peanut butter has added, such as salt and vegetable oils, that may prevent the tasty spread from being more healthful.

But \" our employee was not who he said he was, \" adds lang, son of farm co-owner and prominent republican craig lang. \" this was shocking to us. \" immigration officials now suspect rivera was in the us illegally. Per the ap, a facebook page in his name gives his hometown as guayabillo, mexico, a community of less than 500. The ap adds rivera's attorney, allan richards, on wednesday said he might argue his client was here legally, saying rivera had been in the us since he was a minor and paid taxes. But richards did say he hadn't verified rivera's immigration status. At a vigil at the university of iowa where tibbetts would've started her sophomore year on monday, her brother had one request for the hundreds gathered: make a friend. \" you can always attribute that friendship … to my sister, and that would mean the world to her, \" he said, per the register.",

While searching for the driver, officer michael chesna, a married iraq and afghanistan veteran with two kids ages 4 and 9, found emanuel lopes, 20, allegedly vandalizing a home. Chesna drew his gun and ordered lopes to stop, but, police say, lopes threw a rock at chesna, hitting him in the head and knocking him to the ground. Lopes then allegedly took chesna's gun and shot him multiple times in the head and chest. Officers fired on lopes and gave chase as he allegedly continued to shoot, cnn reports. One of lopes ' alleged shots killed vera adams, 77, who was sitting inside her home nearby. Lopes had been arrested in september for allegedly throwing a rock through the bedroom window of a home he'd been asked to leave; he was charged with property damage and released on pre-trial probation. He was arrested again in october on charges of dealing cocaine and resisting arrest, the boston herald reports; he was freed on bail in november and was due in court july 30 for those charges. He had entered an addiction treatment center sometime after posting bail in november, court papers show, but it's not clear when he left. As a condition of his probation he was required to remain free of drugs and alcohol, but he allegedly failed to appear for a random drug screening in february; at a pre-trial probation violation hearing in april, he was allowed to remain free with the same conditions.

According to the referee's report from the saturday game between riverdale and smyrna, players \" missed 12-16 free throws intentionally, \" \" wouldn't get the ball across the half-court line to get a 10-second count or to make us call an over and back violation intentionally, \" and one player \" looked at one of the officials and gave the official a 3-second signal, wanting him to call three seconds on her, \" the daily news journal reports. The ref says the last straw was when a smyrna player was about to shoot at the wrong basket. Both teams were trying to avoid facing top-ranked blackman high school in the tournament, reports usa today. After the referee ordered both coaches not to make a \" travesty or mockery of the game, \" smyrna ended up winning, but the tennessee secondary school athletic association decided to pull both teams from the postseason, fine the schools $ 1,500 each, and put them on probation for a year, espn reports. Smyrna's principal tells the news journal that he and his counterpart at riverdale failed to convince the tssaa to allow both teams to stay in the playoffs with both coaches suspended.

He dug up a 2004 study that asked 45 men and 18 women to sleep on one side or the other and fill out a popular sleep questionnaire called the pittsburgh sleep quality index ( which evaluates sleep using seven factors, including \" subjective sleep quality, \" sleep duration, and use of sleep drugs ). The study found that just 14.6 % of right-side sleepers reported bad dreams, compared to 40.9 % of their lefty counterparts. Right-side sleepers also reported more dreams with feelings of safety or relief, but had worse-quality sleep than left-siders. Berical also found a 2012 study that analyzed the sleep positions and dreams of over 670 students. The study found that face-down sleepers had more positive and vivid dreams, which were more often about \" sex, \" \" being unable to move, \" \" being tied up, \" or \" being locked up, \" van winkles reports. The researcher behind that study, calvin kai-ching yu, concluded that \" the brain during sleep is not at all totally detached from the external world, \" adding that \" the unconscious brains of the dreamers try to make sense, and even make use of, the external stimuli. \" berical's conclusion? \" it can't hurt to roll your loved one over when you sense a nightmare coming on, \" he writes. \" assuming you can avoid the flailing arms, that is. \" ( it turns out that humans are incredibly good at sleeping. )",

Though the conversations were recorded by us intelligence in early 2015, months before trump announced his campaign for the presidency, investigators are interested in mentions of meetings between russian officials and trump associates, some of which reportedly occurred outside of the us, the wall street journal reports. It isn't clear if the associates referred to were involved in trump's business interests in russia or later became part of his presidential campaign. Officials say it's commonplace for russian officials to discuss players with major business interests in the country, trump among them. Indeed, intelligence agencies initially took little from the conversations. But trump jr.'s meeting with a kremlin-connected lawyer who claimed to have damaging information on hillary clinton has since renewed interest. President trump said wednesday he only became aware of the meeting with the lawyer \" a couple of days ago, \" per reuters. Hours after trump jr. Confirmed the meeting on june 7, 2016, however, trump promised in a speech to address clinton's \" corrupt dealings \" to give \" favorable treatment \" to \" the russians, \" in what the white house is calling a coincidence, reports the new york times.",

        "summary": "Volusia county, fla., was declared the \" shark bite capital of the world \" this year by the international shark attack file, according to nbc, and it doesn't seem to be in danger of losing the title. A 10-year-old boy was in chest-deep water at daytona beach shores yesterday when he was bitten on the calf by a shark, wesh reports. Officials say the boy was treated for lacerations at the scene and didn't need to go to a hospital. He was the county's fourth shark victim of the year and the second in the space of a week: another 10-year-old boy was severely injured last week in a shark attack at cocoa beach, around 60 miles south of the latest attack, nbc reports. This is the 11th attack in the state so far this year, which isn't an exceptionally high number, shark expert dr. George burgess tells wesh, noting that \" the number of humans that are killed by sharks versus the number of sharks killed by human beings is 10 million to one. \" he advises swimmers worried about sharks to stay in groups and avoid areas where fishermen put out bait. Two young people lost limbs in shark attacks in oak island, nc, on sunday and the town is considering banning shark fishing to protect swimmers from sharks attracted by the bait, the ap reports. ( a 16-year-old boy who lost his left arm in sunday's attack says he won't let it ruin his life. )",

Then, in march of this year, kelley made contact through her lawyer, who told the new hampshire prosecutor that kelley was prepared to face her charge of custodial interference. The 50-year-old turned herself in monday. Says her lawyer per the ap, \" she wants to be vindicated. She wants a trial. \" mary turned 18 in february, meaning she is no longer under the purview of family court. In 2009, the ap categorized the girl's vanishing as \" the climax of a long, acrimonious tug of war. \" kelley and mark nunes divorced in 1998, with kelley retaining primary custody of the girl. The ensuing years were not exactly smooth, and in late 2003, kelley told police that nunes had sexually abused mary; those allegations were determined to be unfounded. Roughly a month after the trio disappeared, mark nunes was awarded legal custody of the child. Mary's current location remains unknown, per cnn, though kelley says she is safe. The find mary nunes website has a phone number in the right rail of every page, along with this message: \" mary, here is a number so you can talk to your daddy. It is on 24 hours a day.

        "summary": "When germany invaded norway in 1940, nazi leader heinrich himmler endorsed the concept of german soldiers hooking up with norwegian women, as that would help bring the nazis closer to the aryan master race they wished for. Per the bbc, about 50,000 norwegian women ended up in relationships with the germans, and they became known as the \" german girls \" — a label that led to harsh punishments after wwii ended when their country turned on them for what was viewed as a betrayal. Now, norway's prime minister is officially offering an apology to those women, calling them \" victims of undignified treatment \" and noting that norwegian authorities back then acted outside of usual conventions in punishing these women and the children they bore. \" for many, this was just a teenage love, \" norwegian pm erna solberg said wednesday at a un human rights event. \" for some, the love of their lives with an enemy soldier or an innocent flirt... Left its mark for the rest of their lives. Today, in the name of the government, i want to offer my apologies. \" punishments included getting fired from their jobs, detentions, being stripped of their nationality, and even expulsions to germany. Meanwhile, many of the more than 10,000 children who came out of these relationships were sent to foster homes or \" special institutions, \" deutsche welle notes.

Volunteers have flocked from across northern california to assist in any way they can, reports the los angeles times. The helpers include scores of home depot workers and an engineer from the czech republic who was on vacation in san francisco when the quake struck and drove out to offer his services. \" when you meet people who are helping each other, there's no difference between religions or between colors, \" he says. More: the damage is estimated at up to $ 1 billion, but wineries say they will pull through and they hope tourists won't stay away, the new york times reports. \" in the end, people who are growing grapes are farmers, \" says an official of an organization that represents 500 local vintners. \" this is a particularly strong expression of mother nature, but they deal with mother nature every day, and they are very resilient. \" dozens of homes have been declared uninhabitable and more than 250 people are recovering from injuries, but there have been no fatalities from the area's worst earthquake since 1989, the san francisco chronicle reports. The two most seriously injured victims, one of them a 13-year-old boy hurt by a falling chimney, are both expected to survive. Seismologists are still working to determine the exact cause of the quake, livescience reports. It was initially believed to be connected to the franklin fault — which has been dormant for thousands of years — but researchers now believe it was the west napa fault, part of a wide network of faults around the san andreas fault, which lies 31 miles away.",

The 80-year-old mogul emerged from the meeting at a london hotel to catcalls of \" shame on you \" from",

It is alleged the sunday tabloid hacked into the teenager's mobile after she was abducted in 2002, when rebekah brooks was editor. Messages were deleted to make room for more recordings, it is claimed, and this gave the family false hope that she was still alive. Mrs brooks has resigned as news international chief executive after coming under increasing pressure since the allegations about milly's phone emerged a couple of weeks ago. Mrs brooks denies any knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing. And the scandal has claimed another senior executive at news corporation. Les hinton, who worked for the company for 52 years, has stepped down as chief executive officer of dow jones &amp; company. He worked at news international from 1995 until 2007 when he told the culture, media and sport select committee he had not seen any evidence the hacking had spread beyond one rogue journalist. Meanwhile, an apology written by mr murdoch over the phone hacking scandal will appear in national newspapers on saturday."

That's the position mark cuban found himself in yesterday, after a perhaps-too-candid talk at inc. Magazine's growco conference the day prior. Asked about the donald sterling controversy, the dallas mavericks owner said he was worried about being a hypocrite. The money quote, which he said in roughly these terms at the conference and reiterated in this video interview with inc.: \" i know i ' m bigoted in a lot of different ways. If i see a black kid in a hoodie and it's late at night, i ' m walking to the other side of the street. And if on that side of the street, there's a guy that has tattoos all over his face — white guy, bald head, tattoos everywhere — i ' m walking back to the other side of the street. \" \" i ' m a bigot, \" cuban said at the conference. \" i think we're all bigots. \" then he predicted, \" i ' m sure that ' ll be all over the place, \" and, lo, that prophesy came true. Critics and supporters have been vigorously decrying and defending cuban's remarks ( there's a good sample at the dallas morning news ). Many, including espn commentator bomani jones and cnn commentator lz granderson, jumped on cuban for making a false equivalency between black men in hoodies and white men with tattoos. \" one has history and the other doesn't, or the same sort of emotional response, \" granderson said. Later cuban conceded that point at least, in a series of tweets: \" in hindsight i should have used different examples. I didn't consider the trayvon martin family, and i apologize to them for that. Beyond apologizing to the martin family, i stand by the words and substance of the interview. \"",

A previous investigation by the two news outlets suggested that former district attorney mary lacy erred when she exonerated members of the ramsey family in 2008 based on her interpretation of earlier dna tests. Lacy concluded that those tests revealed that an intruder killed the girl, but outside forensic experts have since disputed that, asserting that the dna was a mishmash of multiple people and not that of the single person referred to as \" unknown male 1. \" \" if you're looking for someone that doesn't exist, because actually it's several people, it's a problem, \" explained a former us attorney for colorado. The new, more sophisticated tests could provide an answer to which view is right. They could also reveal the dna is worthless in terms of tracking down the killer, and merely the result of \" inconsequential contact with other people, \" per the camera. One of the most high-profile anniversary stories about the case came via cbs, whose expert panel concluded that jonbenet's brother, burke, killed his sister. Burke has since sued, but the forensic pathologist he's going after argued in court documents this month that his view on the case was mere \" speculation \" about \" one of the major unsolved crimes \" of the 20th century and thus should be protected speech, reports people. No word on when the new dna tests will be conducted. ( burke also talked to dr. Phil. )",

Rich piana, 46, collapsed while his girlfriend was cutting his hair at his florida apartment aug. 7. He was rushed to a hospital and placed into a medically induced coma, but never recovered; he died early friday, tmz reports. In its initial report on the incident, tmz sports reported that piana's girlfriend, chanel, said that he hit his head when he fell. She also told authorities that he at one point in the past had a slightly enlarged heart. His cause of death is not yet clear, but tmz notes that in a search of his apartment, authorities found not only steroids but also a crushed-up white powder near a credit card and a straw. Emergency responders gave him two doses of narcan in an attempt to revive him, though his girlfriend told authorities she believed piana, who did struggle with opiate addiction in the past, was currently clean. Piana had won several bodybuilding competitions, including mr. California, and was a hit on instagram. Both his girlfriend and his ex-wife have posted remembrances on social media.",

This though reuters in 2015 reported that the location on the island of spitsbergen was supposed to be so cold that in the event of power failure the nearly 1 million packets of crop seeds within the vault would be preserved for at least 200 years.

Also not in the plans: watching the vault 24/7, as they are doing now. But now all the reasons not to panic: that water didn't make it to the vault, and new waterproofing work is underway. One of the vault's creators ( who wasn't present during the incident ) tells popular science \" in my experience, there's been water intrusion at the front of the tunnel every single year. \" he explains the protective mechanics of the path to the seeds: a 330-foot tunnel, two pumping stations, and a brief uphill slant before the vault, whose 0.4-degree fahrenheit temperature would freeze any water that made it that far.

So we are doing measures to improve and secure the entrance and tunnel, \" aschim said. Aschim added that this year, no water has leaked into the entryway. In october, the water made it about 15 meters into the 100 meter tunnel and then stopped, freezing solid. The volume of the water that leaked in is unknown.

            "Global crop diversity trust via flickr update 5/22: recently, media reports emerged of water leaking into the entryway of the svalbard global seed vault, a facility that stores backup seeds for other seed banks all over the world. The facility is designed to be a backup for the backups. In an e-mail to popular science, hege njaa aschim — communications director of the norwegian government-led organization statsbygg, confirmed that the leaks happened last fall, during a time of high temperatures and unusual rainfall in the svalbard area. \"this fall — october 2016 — we had extreme weather in svalbard with high temperatures and a lot of rain — very unusual. This caused water intrusion into the tunnel leading to the seed vault. The seeds and the vault was never at risk. This was no flooding, but more water than we like. So we are doing measures to improve and secure the entrance and tunnel, \" aschim said. Aschim added that this year, no water has leaked into the entryway. In october, the water made it about 15 meters into the 100 meter tunnel and then stopped, freezing solid. The volume of the water that leaked in is unknown. Even before the events of october 2016, statsbygg had already planned to take measures to waterproof the tunnel, which had an established tendency to let water in during",
            "Oslo ( reuters ) - syria's civil war has prompted the first withdrawal of seeds from a \"doomsday \" vault built in an arctic mountainside to safeguard global food supplies, officials said on monday. Television crews stand outside the global seed vault before the opening ceremony in longyearbyen february 26, 2008. Reuters/bob strong the seeds, including samples of wheat, barley and grasses suited to dry regions, have been requested by researchers elsewhere in the middle east to replace seeds in a gene bank near the syrian city of aleppo that has been damaged by the war. \"protecting the world's biodiversity in this manner is precisely the purpose of the svalbard global seed vault, \" said brian lainoff, a spokesman for the crop trust, which runs the underground storage on a norwegian island 1,300 km ( 800 miles ) from the north pole. The vault, which opened on the svalbard archipelago in 2008, is designed to protect crop seeds - such as beans, rice and wheat - against the worst cataclysms of nuclear war or disease. It has more than 860,000 samples, from almost all nations. Even if the power were to fail, the vault would stay frozen and sealed for at least 200 years.

        "summary": "At least 99 people have been quarantined in four different locations in uganda so far after state house uganda confirmed a man died this week of the marburg virus — a type of hemorrhagic fever that's strikingly similar to ebola, cnn reports. Many of the individuals now in isolation are health workers, as the deceased was a radiographer in a kampala hospital and another health center and had contact with multiple colleagues. So far 11 of the quarantined have tested negative for marburg, though they may be retested in a few days if the symptoms they've developed don't disappear. And those symptoms might sound familiar if you've been following the ebola situation: both viruses are members of the filovirus family and manifest in similar ways, including fever, severe headache, and major bleeding, the washington post reports. Although many of the outbreaks recorded since marburg was ided in 1967 have been single cases, the fatality rate ranges from 23 % to 90 % ( if you discount those single-case years ), the cdc notes. Perhaps to mitigate increasing concern over ebola after thomas duncan's death in texas this week, cdc director thomas frieden has been talking up efforts the cdc has undertaken in uganda and emphasized that no further marburg cases have been documented. \" that may not make headlines, but it does give us confidence that we can control ebola in west africa, \" he says, per cnn. Dr. Ruhakana rugunda, uganda's prime minister, seems to share frieden's optimism, posting a series of tweets this week that indicate the country's success rate and experience in dealing with hemorrhagic fevers.",

The americans were dominated by mexico for most of the game but won the friendly 1-0 with a late goal from michael orozco fiscal, the ap reports. Mexico scrambled to get back in the game but were defeated by a pair of remarkable saves from goalkeeper tim howard. \" the goal was for the us fans and the whole us. We made history, \" said orosco fizcal, a defender from orange, california. \" it's important to us to understand that we can compete with big teams at their stadiums, \" us coach jurgen klinsmann told sports illustrated. \" with azteca it's like when you play at wembley in england or the stade de france or in berlin. Those are very special locations, and i want the players to appreciate that. I want the players to understand and take it all in, because you never know if you ' ll get another occasion like that. We told the players: you have nothing to lose here. Give it all you have. \" the team is back in action for a pair of world cup qualifiers against jamaica next month.",

The california department of corrections and rehabilitation will now review each parolee's case individually, and a spokesman for the cdcr says \" high-risk \" offenders who've been convicted of sexually abusing a child under the age of 14 still won't be allowed within a half-mile of any k-12 school. California residents had voted for the \" jessica's law \" residency legislation in 2006, but the state supreme court ruled march 2 that the law was unconstitutional in san diego county, the los angeles times reports. While \" the court's ruling is specific to san diego county, its rationale isn't, \" explains the spokesman. Those who opposed the law have pointed out that the restrictions had kept parolees from finding a place to live in urban areas, where employment and rehab services are more plentiful, per the chronicle. The more stringent housing rules will apply while the cases of some 6,000 california sex offenders are reviewed, which should take about two months, the paper notes.",
