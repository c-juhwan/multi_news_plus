        "summary": "With all eyes on the senate this weekend, one name keeps cropping up as pivotal deal-maker: mitch mcconnell. Politico and the wall street journal see the senate minority leader as key to any potential compromise that could be struck as harry reid's bill winds through the senate. As democratic sen. Dick durbin puts it, \"what these senators on the republican side are waiting for is a permission slip from sen. Mcconnell. \" the washington post says mcconnell is ticked because president obama rejected a potential compromise last week and is insisting that the white house be at the table in weekend talks. As for what a final deal could look like, the los angeles times sees the \" rough outlines of compromise emerging. \" it would be similar in framework to john boehner's failed bill, with a big difference being that it would not require a second vote on raising the debt ceiling in a matter of months. It would also have some kind of \" trigger \" to mandate further cuts if congress doesn't meet deficit-reduction goals. The trigger is vital to getting gop support, explains sam stein at the huffington post.",

That last activity is how one baltimore aviation aficionado ( and ex-aclu employee ) spent last saturday night, picking up on a twitter friend's query to uncover an interesting yet disturbing development: what appeared to be two cessnas equipped with infrared technology flying in \" precise formations \" over the area in baltimore that saw the most unrest after the death of freddie gray, the washington post reports. One plane reportedly showed up on three consecutive nights. The aclu is now demanding answers about the legality of the planes and how much surveillance they've actually done. Pete cimbolic was the guy who put the pieces together after another local, benjamin shayne, tweeted under his @scanbaltimore handle, \" anyone know who has been flying the light plane in circles above the city for the last few nights? \" cimbolic headed to a flight data aggregator and onto the faa site to discover the plane he was tracking was registered to a company called ng research, the post notes; he couldn't get info on the second plane. A baltimore pd spokesman referred the post to the fbi on the flight queries; the fbi declined to comment. The only person talking — a government official speaking anonymously — says the police requested the planes from the fbi as \" aerial support. \" an aclu senior policy analyst tells the post, \" a lot of these technologies sweep very, very broadly. … the public should have a right to know what's going on. \" ( in cheerier baltimore news: prince will be playing a \" peace \" concert there this weekend. )",

        "summary": "Reidite is one of the rarest minerals on earth — it's been found in only four places. The most recent is rock elm, wisconsin, where scientists discovered the material in a crater, phys.org reports. The crater has been around since the geologic period known as the middle ordovician, and that means the sample found there is the oldest preserved reidite ever found, at some 450 million years old. What makes it even more unusual is that it was found in sandstone, unlike any of the other reidite finds. That fact could drive experts to take a new look at other sandstone impact structures, phys.org notes. Reidite is actually a particularly dense form of another mineral, zircon, livescience reports. Zircon becomes reidite via soaring pressures and temperatures following a meteorite impact. \" rocks in earth's crust do not experience these kinds of pressures from any known process other than an extraterrestrial impact, \" a researcher tells twincities.com. The mineral has previously been found at meteorite impact sites in virginia, germany, and china; the first discovery of reidite in nature occurred in 2001. ( in other recent geological finds, california yielded a six-pound gold nugget. )",

An exchange between the two about the civil war apparently didn't make the cut, but it will air on sirus xm monday afternoon ( this clip has been released ), and a bit the president had to say about president andrew jackson and the civil war hasn't been too well received. It all started with a comparison trump made between his campaign and andrew jackson's that ended up going here: \" he was a swashbuckler.... Had andrew jackson been a little bit later you wouldn't have had the civil war... He saw what was happening with regard to the civil war, he said there's no reason for this. People don't realize, you know, the civil war, if you think about it, why? people don't ask that question, but why was there the civil war, why couldn't that one have been worked out? \" the atlantic is succinct in its response to trump's \" why \": slavery. David a. Graham notes that even with his tony education, trump, like many americans, may be \" ill-served by his education when it comes to the civil war. Many americans are still taught, incorrectly, that the war was essentially a conflict over state's rights, with abolition as a byproduct of the war. This revisionist view flourished after the war, and though gradually being displaced, is common across the country. \" as far as history goes, the ap points out what most reports on the exchange do: jackson died in 1845, 16 years before the war's 1861 start. Though trump rightly points out jackson would have had to come \" later, \" some are jumping on trump saying he \" saw what was happening. \" and then there's jackson himself, whom slate points out owned 161 slaves and framed abolitionism as a threat to the \" safety of our country, commerce, and our revenue. \" slate's view is that any alterna-history that saw jackson averting war would have involved the continuation of slavery. As everyone piles on jackson, referred to by trump as having a \" big heart, \" tpm points out he signed an act that paved the way for the trail of tears, which led to the deaths of thousands of native americans. The washington post recalls that just last week trump said much the same thing about a different conflict, telling reuters, \" there is no reason there's not peace between",

Myler, 59, will now take over the battle against the new york post, where he worked as managing editor and executive editor for five years. He left the post to become the mop-up editor of the news of the world as the newspaper's phone hacking scandal blew up, amid an increasingly strained relationship with the murdoch family, notes the bbc. Myler was left without a job when murdoch shuttered the paper. Now might be the time for some payback. Myler was \" obviously very upset at what transpired at news of the world, \" former daily news editor martin dunn tells the guardian. \" this will be a great opportunity for him to take his journalistic skills into battle with the murdoch family in rupert's own backyard. \" after his bruising time in london, the guardian speculates that myler will likely view the new york showdown as little more than a \" pillow fight. \" myler replaces convey, who left the boston herald to take over the job as editor-in-chief of the news over a year ago.",

After the arrest of a man and woman in south london, both aged 67, police are searching possible linked addresses for other slaves — or possibly bodies. In other developments: the circumstances of the captivity are still unclear. Police say the women's lives were \" greatly controlled \" — but they also had some \" controlled freedom, \" the sydney morning herald reports. The 30-year-old woman had apparently spent her entire life in captivity before the police rescue. Asked if she had gone to school, a police spokesman said she had \" no contact with the outside world that one would see as normal. \" the other victims are a 69-year-old malaysian woman and a 57-year-old irish woman. It's not clear who the parents of the 30-year-old are, but investigators say they haven't seen any evidence of sexual abuse. The three women, who had become \" institutionalized to a very bad way of living, \" found the courage to contact the anti-domestic abuse freedom charity after it came up in a documentary, charity founder aneeta prem tells the bbc. Over weeks of secretive phone calls, the charity was able to gain the women's trust. \" one of the key things that has come up is that these three ladies were absolutely terrified by these people, \" she says. After leaving the house last month, the women were so traumatized that it took investigators weeks to obtain enough information to arrest their alleged captors. The freed women are now being treated by specialists in a place of safety, police say. Police have released few details about the \" heads of the family \" who were arrested. The couple, who police say are not british, were bailed after being questioned at a south london police station yesterday. There is no sign that the neighbors had any idea what was going on. The house in the london borough of lambeth was \" just an ordinary house in an ordinary street, \" prem says.",

He was described as someone who had led an \" anti-social lifestyle and abused spirits \". The alleged killer had apparently been lodging with him for several months before the fatal dispute. In september, in the south russian town of rostov-on-don, a reported argument about the philosopher immanuel kant ended in an air pistol being fired and one man being injured.",
            "Moscow, january 29 ( ria novosti ) – poetry can kill after all. A former teacher was detained in russia's urals after being accused of stabbing an acquaintance to death in a dispute about literary genres, investigators said wednesday. The 67-year-old victim insisted that \"the only real literature is prose, \" the sverdlovsk region's branch of the investigative committee said. The victim's assertion outraged the 53-year-old suspect, who favored poetry, and the dispute ended with the ex-teacher stabbing his friend to death, investigators said. Both of the men were purportedly drunk at the time. The incident took place last week, but the suspect fled the scene and was not tracked down until days later. The man, whose name has been withheld, was placed under arrest and charged with murder, punishable with up to 15 years in prison. This is not the first time high-brow disputes have led to bloodshed in russia. In september, a man was shot in a line for beer in the southern city of rostov-on-don after enraging a fellow beer drinker with his views about the work of enlightenment philosopher immanuel kant."

The encarnacíon, built in mexico, sank in 1681, and it tells a tale of a key historical moment, archaeologist filipe castro tells national geographic: \" it is the rise of capitalism, imperialism, rationalism, and the middle classes that are going to buy art and consume literature. \" this particular ship was a cargo vessel that belonged to spain's tierra firme fleet — ships that \" were the backbone of the spanish colonies, \" says research head fritz hanselmann.

What makes this particular ship \" extraordinarily significant \" is that it's incredibly well preserved, archaeologist melanie damour says in a texas state university press release. That's thanks to the fact that it was buried in 3 feet of mud, hanselmann tells the houston chronicle. What's more, unlike many similar finds, it hasn't been looted. That has led researchers to all kinds of artifacts, ranging from sword blades and scissors to mule shoes and ceramics, the chronicle reports. The detailed findings come after researchers pored though spanish archives — but the initial discovery was an accident, national geographic notes. Researchers were actually looking for the ships of captain henry morgan, an english pirate who lost five ships at the mouth of the chagres a decade earlier.

        "summary": "A three-judge panel has wrapped up its hearing into president trump's travel ban after grilling lawyers on both sides of the debate. We can expect a decision later this week, says a spokesman for the 9th circuit court of appeals in san francisco. No matter the outcome, however, an appeal to the supreme court is expected. In the meantime, the ban on travelers from seven predominantly muslim countries remains suspended. Early coverage suggests it's tough to predict how the judges will rule. Examples of the questioning, via the ap, the wall street journal, the new york times, and the washington post. Judge richard clifton, appointed by george w. Bush, sounded skeptical about the justice department's defense of the ban in the name of national security. Noting that the government already has screening in place, he asked, \"is there any reason for us to think that there's a real risk or that circumstances have changed such that there's a real risk? \" justice department attorney august flentje responded, \"the president determined that there was a real risk. \" but clifton also questioned an attorney for washington state, one of the states challenging the ban, on why he thinks the ban is discriminatory. \" i have trouble understanding why we're supposed to infer religious animus when in fact the vast majority of muslims would not be affected. \" noah purcell, washington state's solicitor general, cited previous statements by trump calling for a muslim ban. \"there are statements that … are rather shocking evidence of intent to harm muslims, \" he said. Another judge, carter appointee william canby, at one point asked, \"could the president simply say in the order we're not going to let any muslims in? \" flentje replied: \"that's not what the order does. This is a far cry from that situation. \" judge michelle friedland, appointed by barack obama, wondered about the seven nations named in the ban. \"has the government pointed to any evidence connecting these countries to terrorism? \" flentje said the legal proceedings were moving so fast that the government had not had time to do so, prompting the judge to suggest that his department's appeal came too quickly.",

Their chrome machines glinting in the sunshine, colourful graphics and slogans dotting their black leather vests, members of the rough riders, comanche warriors, sons of liberty, homeboys and other groups gathered in support of those who were killed or imprisoned as a result of the violence at the suburban restaurant three weeks ago. Of those arrested, 102 remain behind bars, said john kolinek, a captain with the mclennan county sheriff's office. Authorities initially set bail at $ 1m, which most have been unable to pay. Biker supporters and lawyers for the accused maintain that many of those arrested on suspicion of engaging in organised crime were innocent bystanders with no connection to illegal gangs and that the bail amount was excessive. Some have been released after their bond was reduced. The sheer number of arrests has placed the local legal system under strain and caused delays an estimated 500 people attended sunday '",

            "3-d technology has been around for decades, but it's only in the past few years that the tech community has really started to push it. That's partly thanks to a few major blockbusters ( spy kids 3d, avatar ) that convinced these companies that 3-d is now viable, but it's also due to the general malaise of film revenue since the piracy revolution. 3-d films often cost 50 % more in theaters than traditional non-3-d movies -- that's how avatar made such ridiculous money -- and in a time when piracy is taking a major bite out of revenues, that price differential is incredibly valuable. On the hardware side, 3-d is finally cheap enough and advanced enough to put into home entertainment, including computer monitors, cameras, video game consoles, and hdtvs. For hardware manufacturers ( one of whom, sony, is both a film studio and a hardware company, and is unsurprisingly leading the charge for 3d-tv ), this is a chance to get consumers to shell out for another tv, even if they just made the upgrade to hdtv. Over the past two years, sony, panasonic, lg, and samsung have stormed every tech convention possible with 3-d.

Jerry brown. Brown will now have five months to decide if davis should be released, reports the ap. Davis has admitted to attacking shea, a stuntman, with a knife and holding hinman, a musician, hostage with a gun while manson tortured him. \" i wanted to be charlie's favorite guy, \" he said in 2014. However, davis ' lawyer says davis is by far the most rehabilitated of his 2,000 clients in prison: \" there's no one even a close second. \" the parole panel cited his good behavior in prison, noting he's become an ordained minister and now works with other inmates, when making its decision. However, los angeles county district attorney jackie lacey disagrees with the recommendation. In a statement, she says davis \" continues to exhibit a lack of insight and remorse and remains a public safety risk \" given his involvement in \" some of the most horrific crimes in california history. \"",

For one thing, where is misty the 7-foot-long boa constrictor? nisbet is investigating the april 19 death of daredevil kirk jones, who was in his early 50s. Jones went over the 170-foot horseshoe falls at niagara falls in what police say appears to be a stunt gone wrong. His body was found 12 miles downriver on june 2, per the bbc. But police still can't figure out exactly what happened. It started when a tourist reported seeing a \" shiny object \" in the rapids april 19. A responding officer discovered the object was an inflatable ball large enough for a person to climb inside — but it was empty. The buffalo news reports the ball went over the falls and was recovered by the maid of the mist tour boat. The next day, police found a crashed drone belonging to jones and received a call from his wife, who had reason to believe he was attempting a stunt at the falls. This led police to a website that appeared to belong to jones and bore the headline: \" believe in the impossible kirk jones + misty conquer niagara falls ny 2017. \" police are looking at a number of possibilities: jones slipped while trying to get himself and the snake into the inflatable ball while it was in the water; the shock of the cold water caused the snake to attack jones; jones got out of the ball when he realized it wasn't watertight. But police don't believe it was a suicide attempt, despite jones previously admitting he was trying to kill himself when he went over the falls in 2003, wivb reports. Nisbet calls it all \" very peculiar. \" \" the answers to our questions probably went over the falls with kirk, \" he tells the gazette.",

The ap reports the new emails were not found on clinton's private email server. They were found on devices belonging to clinton aide huma abedin and husband anthony weiner, according to the new york times. They were found while the fbi investigates weiner for allegedly sexting a 15-year-old girl. It's unclear what's in the new emails, the los angeles times reports. Regardless, comey says he wants the fbi to look into whether the emails contain classified information. In his letter, comey admits that it's impossible to say whether the new emails will be important one way or another, reuters reports. He also says he \" cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work. \" according to cnbc, the stock market dropped as news of comey's letter spread. The same happened to the mexican peso, business insider adds.

And so astronomers have hypothesized that they are in fact asteroids coaxed into orbit by the planet's gravitational pull, reports space.com. Problem is, this would likely have resulted in irregular orbits, but the moons cut a nearly circular path around the martian equator. Now, there's a new hypothesis. \" our results pave a new path to re-understand the martian system in a context of formation similar but not identical to [ that of ] our own moon, \" says pascal rosenblatt of the royal observatory of belgium, whose team just published the new hypothesis in the journal nature geoscience. In their simulations, the team found that much like the formation of earth's moon, phobos and deimos were created when a massive debris disk was ejected into orbit thanks to an impact of astronomical size. They're so small, and a pair instead of a single moon, because they were actually among many moons created by the impact, some of which may have been quite wide, reports scientific american. The moons would have formed in the dense innards of the ejected disk, then stirred its less dense outer regions, where smaller objects like phobos and deimos would have formed. But due to the planet's tidal pull, the larger, inner moons would have fallen back to mars, likely around 5 million years ago, and scientists are now looking for the enormous craters that would pockmark its surface as a result.

The moons of mars, phobos and deimos, may be the only survivors of a giant impact that created many short-lived, but now-absent moons around the red planet, a new study finds. Phobos and deimos are both small for moons — about 14 and 7.7 miles ( 22.5 and 12.4 kilometers ) wide, respectively — and sort of potato-shaped.

        "summary": "Police officials days ago said they didn't expect any more survivors to emerge in the london high-rise blaze, and on friday, things got more grim: there is \" a risk that sadly we may not be able to identify everybody, \" metropolitan police commander stuart cundy tells the bbc. The grenfell tower death toll currently stands at 30, per the ap; as for how many dead there could ultimately be, cundy said he hoped the toll would not end up in the \" triple figures. \" the ap reports that officials have said they genuinely don't know what the toll might be. More: the ap counts one entire family among the missing: bassem choukeir, wife nadia, her mother sariyya, and three daughters. All lived on the 22nd floor. The times of london reports at least six of the bodies recovered were found outside — suggesting they jumped to their deaths in a bid to escape. The times also digs into the building's cladding, which has been the subject of controversy in the wake of the fire. It reports the building was in 2015-2016 refurbished at a cost of $ 11 million, which involved the application of aluminium panels made by us-based reynobond to the exterior. A reynobond sales rep tells the paper the version used on the building has a flammable plastic ( polyethylene ) core and is banned on any building over 40 feet tall in the us because of the potential fire hazard. By the times ' math, the cost of outfitting the building in the fire-resistant version would have tacked $ 6,500 onto the renovation cost. Why was the cladding added? per planning documents seen by the independent, for insulation, but also to \" improve [ the tower's ] appearance especially when viewed from the surrounding area. \" the guardian delves into the building's renovation and finds that nine contractors and subcontractors were involved. This raises \" concerns among architectural and fire safety experts about the quality of oversight and accountability, \" it writes. The bbc notes a criminal investigation into the fire has been launched. The ap reports the fire's starting point has been reviewed, and there are no signs it was arson. On the political front, the bbc reports a \" political row \" emerged over claims pm theresa may spoke only to london fire commissioner dany cotton and other emergency services workers when visiting the site thursday, while labour leader jeremy corbyn and london mayor sadiq khan spoke to residents and their relatives. May will be meeting with the injured friday. The bbc has a harrowing first-person account of a 15th-floor resident who managed to escape. \" on one of the",

And, like your typical americans, the pair may have left bits of their life online.

Now, nbc news has uncovered what it believes is the couple's baby registry, a bare-bones, four-item target list of diapers, a $ 60 car seat, baby wash, and safety swabs. While nbc couldn't verify the registry's authenticity, it does note that it was listed under malik's name, gave riverside, calif., as an address, and specified a may 17 due date. But before there was a baby, there was perhaps love, or, the potential of it. Vocativ reports on two dating website profiles seemingly belonging to the 28-year-old farook. In an imilap.com ( described as a \" one stop source for indian matrimonial and dating services \" ) profile created six years ago, \" farooksyed49 \" identified himself as a 22-year-old chicago-born muslim who hails from a \" religios [ sic ] but modern family. \" he goes on to say he likes working on vintage and modern cars, reading religious books, and doing backyard target practice.

Hundreds or thousands of the striped creatures may very well be sharing your house, a study from north carolina state finds; indeed, 90 % of scientists responding to a census found them in their homes, in places such as basements, crawl spaces, and garages, reports weather.com. Most of the reports came from east of the mississippi. \" one recalls thinking she heard \" popcorn popping. Yet it wasn't popcorn, just tens ( maybe hundreds? ) of camel crickets furtively jumping in the wake of my footsteps, \" study co-author holly menninger writes at yourwildlife.org. Fortunately, they pose no direct threat to us — and it's even possible they're helpful. \" because they are scavengers, camel crickets may actually provide an important service in our basements or garages, eating the dead stuff that accumulates there, \" menninger notes. Diestrammena asynamora crickets have been around in the us since at least the 1800s, infozine reports. Experts long believed, however, that they lived only in greenhouses.

        "summary": "If kirsten gillibrand decides to run for president, politico reports that she shouldn't expect help from several big democratic donors during the primaries. The reason? her role in forcing al franken to resign last year. The website talks to more than a dozen big donors and bundlers on both coasts who say they will not donate to the new york senator or help her raise money. If gillibrand ends up as the nominee, that would change, but she won't be getting any help before then. The gist of the sentiment is that gillibrand led a rush to judgment on franken before the sexual harassment allegations against him were properly vetted. \"i do hear people refer to kirsten gillibrand as 'opportunistic ' and shrewd at the expense of others to advance herself and it seems to have been demonstrated in her rapid treatment of her colleague al franken, \" donor susie tompkins buell tells politico. \" i know [ gillibrand ] thought she was doing the right thing, but i think she will be remembered by this, \" she adds. Gillibrand, for her part, has staunchly defended her role. When george soros voiced a similar complaint against her in august, she responded, \"if standing up for women who have been wronged makes george soros mad, that's on him. \" a post at jezebel suggests it's unfair for the likes of tompkins buell to punish gillibrand, whose call for franken to step down was quickly joined by other female lawmakers. \" that democratic donors are now withholding their money from gillibrand is a reminder that there are costs for speaking up — and powerful people ready to enforce them, \" writes clio chang.

A breakthrough is possible, newhouse says, \" but we would be kidding ourselves if anybody believed that $ 100 million is going to be all that's needed to find an effective treatment. \" ( more uplifting news: a surgeon was able to help a man who had a role in his life 45 years earlier. )",

        "summary": "Sweden's ( former ) highest peak has been taken down a few notches, thanks to the summer heat wave currently scorching europe. Until recently, a glacier perched atop the southern peak of the kebnekaise mountain rose higher than any other point in the country. But, as of wednesday, it had melted so much that it now falls a hair below the height of the mountain's northern peak, the new york times reports. Gunhild ninis rosqvist, a geography professor at stockholm university, says she's \" surprised \" by the rapid melt-off ( about 13 feet during july ), per nbc news, \" even though it has been ridiculously warm. \" once towering 6,892.4 feet, the southern peak was down to 6,879.2 feet as of friday, per business insider. The northern peak measures at 6,879.3 feet. Rosqvist, speaking to a local swedish paper, says the melting glacier is symbolic of climate change, per the times. When first measured in 1880, the southern peak was more than 6,965 feet tall. Since 1995, it has shrunk about 3 feet per year. Still, the southern tip is expected to gain back a bit of lost height during the winter, and the title of highest point may vacillate between the southern and northern peaks in years to come. One consequence of the melting southern peak is that climbers may now opt to tackle the northern peak so they can say they climbed to the highest point in sweden, a rescue worker tells the times. And, he says, that peak is \" much harder to climb \" due to the topography. Record heat has also affected sweden's reindeer herders, causing a lack of vegetation and snow melt that makes it so \" not even the reindeer can find a place to get relief from the sun, \" rosqvist says.",

Aberdeen is continuing its history of careful record-keeping by archiving all findings for public display, the bbc notes. It was this wave of witchcraft persecutions that reached the americas in the 1600s and led to the salem witch trials nearly 100 years after aberdeen's. Archaeologists say they also found evidence of buildings beneath the existing church that date back to the 11th century, as well as the graves of nine babies, who may have been victims of an epidemic, laid near an 11th-century wall.

An iron ring set in the stone pillar of a 15th-century chapel in the scottish city of aberdeen may not look like much, but historians say it could be a direct link to a dark chapter in the city's past — the trial and execution of 23 women and one man accused of witchcraft during aberdeen's \" great witch hunt \" in 1597. \" i was skeptical, to be honest — the ring is not all that spectacular, but it is actually quite genuine, \" said arthur winfield, project leader for the openspace trust in the united kingdom, which is restoring the chapel as part of a community-based redevelopment of the east kirk sanctuary at the historic kirk of st nicholas, in central aberdeen. Winfield told live science that two places within the kirk ( the lowland scots word for \" church \" ) had been equipped as a prison for witches snared in the aberdeen witch hunt: the stone-vaulted chapel of st mary, and the tall steeple of the kirk, which was at that time the tallest structure in the city. [ see more photos of the \" witch prison \" in the scottish church ] winfield said that neither location would have been warm in the winter of 1597, when those accused of witchcraft awaited trail, and likely their execution: \" in the winter nowadays, the temperature gets down to 3 degrees [ celsius ] in st mary's chapel, and i guess it would be even colder up in the spire. \" witch hunting in scotland in the 16th century was not carried out by mobs with pitchforks, but by royal commissions at the orders of the king. As a result, aberdeen's city archives today hold meticulous original records of the witch trials and executions in 1597, including payments to a local blacksmith for the iron rings and shackles installed to imprison accused witches at the kirk of st nicholas. The city records also detail the costs for the rope, wood and tar later used to burn",
            "New light has been shed on the persecution of ' witches'during the transformation of a 900-year-old church. The \" mither kirk \" project has excavated the church of st nicholas which will eventually house a heritage centre. The kirk, which was a witches prison in the 1500s, has an iron ring in the walls where women and men convicted of witchcraft were chained before being burned at the stake. All the details were carefully recorded in archives which will be put on public display. Bbc scotland's fiona stalker has been for a closer look."

Unaccompanied kids — about 1,300 are estimated to be at the camp — will be processed separately, and many are expected to be allowed into britain under new rules, reports the guardian. As the new york times reports, the migrants come from nations such as afghanistan, eritrea, and sudan, and they flocked to the camp near calais in the hope they could then sneak into britain, perhaps by hitching a ride on a truck over the channel tunnel. ( the original trip to calais typically involved a dangerous trip across the mediterranean. ) many think they have a better chance of finding work in the uk than elsewhere in europe, notes the bbc.

        "summary": "Some creatures are so weird they seem to defy classification. They're even assigned the word \" problematica, \" a classification that serves as a sort of purgatory for the strangest of the strange as our understanding of the evolutionary tree of life continues to deepen. Such is the case with the tully monster, which scientists have mulled over since a 300 million-year-old fossil was found more than 50 years ago in central illinois, upi reports. Last year, scientists reported in nature that the sea creature, officially known as tullimonstrum gregarium, is a vertebrate related to the lamprey, pointing to a \" primitive backbone \" once thought to be its gut. Now, in a science daily news release, paleobiologists say not so fast. Reporting this week in the journal palaeontology, researchers claim last year's research was flawed, and that \" the last thing the tully monster could be is a fish. \" they point to its eyes on stalks, which are simple structures without lenses ( vertebrates boast complex eyes ), as well as the fact that it is lacking in structures that all aquatic vertebrates are believed to possess. Lauren sallan says that arguments in favor of it being a kind of arthropod like a lobster or a kind of mollusk like a sea cucumber are \" well-constructed, \" and notes that while there are \" plenty of weird things and that's great, if you're going to make extraordinary claims, you need extraordinary evidence. \" misassignment, she warns, \" really affects our understanding of vertebrate evolution. \" ( speaking of classification, scientists have discovered our 79th organ. )",

        "summary": "Oscar de la renta was not happy when only child moises, the son he adopted as a newborn from the dominican republic, started his own fashion line in 2005. And apparently that grudge persisted right up until de la renta's death in october, because moises, 30, was left what page six describes as \" a relatively threadbare portion \" of the fashion designer's $ 26 million estate in a will signed just weeks before de la renta's death. The kicker: if moises attempts to contest the will, it stipulates that he won't even get that \" relatively threadbare \" amount. Most of the 82-year-old's estate was left to his second wife, with some also left to her three children, and one of those three children was named as alternate executor of the will — which page six sees as another snub to moises. As for the aforementioned fashion line, mdlr, it did not find success. ( check out more controversial celebrity wills. )",

            "The son of late fashion designer oscar de la renta is paying dearly for having fallen out with his father. Moises de la renta, adopted by oscar from an orphanage in their native dominican republic, was left a relatively threadbare portion of his dad's $ 26 million estate — and was warned that if he ever tried to contest the will, he would be cut out completely, court documents show. Moises, 30, had angered his dad by launching his own women's fashion line in 2005. His father, who outfitted such luminaries as jackie kennedy onassis and amal clooney, apparently never forgave him. Oscar, who died in october at age 82, left most of his estate to his wife of 25 years, annette, in his six-page will, signed several weeks before his death. Her haul includes all of oscar's belongings, plus his real estate holdings, including a $ 13 million park avenue apartment, $ 2.8 million connecticut home and a dominican estate. The rest of his funds was put in a trust to be split between annette, her three children and moises, who was his dad's only child. The will puts annette, oscar's second wife, in control of the funds, which include his $ 3.3 million citibank account and a $ 1.2 million tax refund. Rather than moises, oscar's stepdaughter eliza bolen was named as an alternate executor of the will. Bolen, daughter of annette, is a vice president of the fashion house. The will — filed in litchfield county probate court in connecticut, where the designer lived with annette — gives a glimpse into the couple's lifestyle. For example, annette billed the estate $ 80,000 on may 18 for expenses including a $ 2,533.82 trip to a citarella gourmet market and $ 13,933 for landscaping. In 2005, the post reported moises was building his own fashion \"empire \" \"to bring the de la renta aura to a younger crowd. \" oscar later publicly lashed out at his son. \"moises did a little line, five or six pieces. But that doesn't make a fashion designer, \" he told new york magazine. Oscar said he adopted moises, then just 24 hours old, after his first wife, francoise, died of cancer. \"i never thought i would get married again. I thought my son and i would have each other, \" he said. But in 1989, oscar wed annette,"

The bill would make using the wrong bathroom punishable by a fine of up to $ 2,500, az family reports. The house appropriations committee will take up the bill today. The bill has sparked outrage from transgender activists; equality arizona released a statement yesterday calling it \" a disgusting invasion of privacy, \" one that could make criminals of women who duck into men's bathrooms to avoid long lines, the arizona daily sun reports. ( kavanagh says police will \" use discretion \" in those circumstances. ) laurie roberts at the arizona republic decries the bill as ridiculous. \" forget about showing your birth certificate to vote, \" she writes. \" you soon may need to tote the thing around in order to use the bathroom. \"",

        "summary": "The american workspace is getting smaller. In 2010, there was an average of 225 square feet of office space per office employee in north america; in 2012, the figure was down to 176 square feet, the new york times reports based on data from a real estate association. The group expects the number to drop to 151 square feet by 2017, time reports. And in new york city, things look even tighter. A survey of 10 new office spaces cited by the times found that the average amount of room per worker was 120 square feet, with the maximum at 178 and the minimum at 93. The shrinking comes as companies look to reduce their costs; some real estate firms suggest that companies move to spaces as much as 25 % smaller than what they're currently using in order to save on rent. One result, of course, is less privacy, especially as many offices opt for open plans. These days, notes dilbert creator scott adams, \" if you've got a place to hang a coat and a place to sit with a laptop, you've got everything you need. \" meanwhile, some designers have created separate spaces called \" refuge rooms \" for an escape from the noise. One architect at a firm that designs open plans tells the times private offices should exist, but they shouldn't be assigned to specific staff members. \" if you don't have that refuge, it's horrible, \" she says.

        "summary": "As the planet continues to warm, you can expect more droughts, more flooding, more powerful storms, and, apparently, more suicides. That's according to stanford researchers who scoured data on 850,000 suicides in the us between 1968 and 2004 and 611,000 suicides in mexico between 1990 and 2010. They see a link between temperature increases and increases in the suicide rate. Specifically, the suicide rate increased 0.7 % in the us and 2.1 % in mexico when the average monthly temperature was 1 degree celsius higher than normal. That was true across income levels regardless of whether the temperature rose in january or july, in hot or cold climates. \" it's sort of a brutal finding, \" study author marshall burke tells the atlantic, with the guardian describing expected burdens on wealthy countries where suicide rates are already high. Unless greenhouse-gas emissions are reduced, burke predicts this link between suicide and temperature will result in another 14,000 to 26,000 us deaths by suicide by 2050, a change equal to \" the estimated impact of economic recessions, \" according to the study published monday in the journal nature climate change. The link itself dates back to century-old observations of increases in suicide in summer months, but it remains little understood. As use of depressive language on twitter was also found to increase with the temperature, burke — who co-authored a 2013 study suggesting a similar effect on interpersonal violence — suggests \" there's a plausible biological linkage between temperature, thermal regulation and how the brain regulates its own emotion, \" per cnn.

In a facebook post, whitman, who was co-chair of chris christie's campaign and ran for governor of california in 2010, describes herself as a \" proud republican, \" but she says she cannot \" endorse a candidacy that i believe has exploited anger, grievance, xenophobia, and racial division. \" she adds: \" donald trump's demagoguery has undermined the fabric of our national character. \" in other developments: trump has fired back at obama's accusation that he is \" unfit to serve as president. \" obama \" will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the united states, \" he tweeted. He later told fox's o'reilly factor that obama has been a \" disaster \" — but clinton could be even worse. As the trump-khan controversy rumbled on, trump campaign spokeswoman katrina pierson offered a new spin on it by telling cnn that obama probably caused the death of capt. Humayun khan. He died in iraq in 2004, when obama was still a state senator in illinois, and pierson was soon mocked on twitter under the hashtag #katrinapiersonhistory, reports usa today. The los angeles times reports on another setback for trump: on tuesday, us district court judge gonzalo curiel ruled that the trump university racketeering lawsuit can proceed this fall. He did, however, agree with trump's lawyers that trump's video depositions in the case shouldn't be released to the media. Curiel is the judge targeted by trump for his mexican heritage, which trump claims creates a conflict of interest. French president francois hollande came out with his strongest criticism yet of trump on tuesday, saying the candidate makes him sick, the ap reports. \" some excesses make your stomach turn, even in the united states, especially when — as did donald trump — he speaks ill of a soldier, of the memory of a soldier, \" he told members of the french presidential press association. Politico reports that trump's refusal to back down from the khan feud has split the gop, but it has \" energized \" anti-trump republicans who have been feeling adrift since the convention.

The rumors may, however, have been circulated by clinton supporters before being revived later that year by supporters of john mccain. During the post interview, trump slammed upcoming debate moderator anderson cooper, denied having \" embraced \" vladimir putin, and said that although disgraced former fox news chief roger ailes is a friend, he has no plans to form a media company with him. \" i want to win the presidency, and i want to make america great again, \" trump said. \" it's very simple.

        "summary": "The rate at which autism is diagnosed around the world has increased dramatically in just a generation, and researchers studying a comprehensive tracking system in denmark say they can explain the majority of the uptick: new and improved diagnosis. In the medical journal jama pediatrics, they argue that the huge jump in autism rates essentially isn't real, reports forbes. More precisely, \" the increase is likely more about previously unidentified autistic individuals getting an autism diagnosis than more individuals actually developing autism, \" writes tara haelle. For one thing, the word \" autism \" hasn't been around terribly long, and until the 1960s it was linked to schizophrenia. Even as recently as the 1980s, it was described as an \" infantile \" disorder, diagnosed only when symptoms appeared before age 3. Denmark widened its definition of autism in 1994, and when the nation's health registries started tracking outpatient diagnoses in addition to those admitted to health care facilities in 1995, the autism rate soared. Similar diagnostic changes have occurred in the us, where 1 in 68 kids are diagnosed with the disorder, reports time. Still, notes the san francisco chronicle, the findings account for only 60 % of the increase. \" i am not saying it explains everything, \" says the study's author. But it's \" important because it shows a large part of the increase has nothing to do with the environment, but rather administrative decisions. \" ( other research suggests that exposure to high levels of air pollution in utero could raise a child's risk of autism. )",

As does kelsey zwick, a young mom on that same flight with her 11-month-old daughter, lucy, headed from orlando to philly to receive treatment for the baby's chronic lung disease. Usa today reports that zwick, lucy, and lucy's oxygen tank had just settled into their window seat, with zwick preemptively apologizing to nearby passengers about the noise lucy might make during the flight. That's when, per zwick's facebook post, a flight attendant approached and informed her a man in first class wanted to give up his seat so zwick and lucy could be more comfortable during the ride. \" i cried my way up the aisle while my daughter lucy laughed! \" she writes. She was only able to say a brief \" thank you \" to the good samaritan, but after her post went viral, the two touched base again, and he told her her gratitude gave him a \" birthday to remember, \" per yahoo. Us weekly has identified the kindly stranger as jason kunselman, and he notes he'd felt compelled to give up his seat after seeing zwick lugging around herself, the baby, and the oxygen canister. Kunselman's gesture was especially touching to zwick because she and her husband have been through so much over the past two years, including the birth of lucy and her twin, eva, at just 29 weeks; she details to yahoo the struggles they've had since. \" thank you, \" she reiterates to kunselman in her post. \" not just for the seat itself but for noticing. For seeing us and realizing that maybe things are not always easy. \" ( this man stuck up for a mom being mocked on a plane. )",

Though he says researchers believed the ocean floor in the area was \" billiard-table flat, \" a new $ 120 million research vessel capable of mapping the seafloor at any depth revealed four calderas — big bowl-shaped craters shaped when the land around an erupting volcano crumples — across 12 miles. The largest, three miles below the surface, is almost half a mile tall and a mile across. Experts believe they were formed when shifting ocean plates broke australia apart from new zealand. \" we went there to look at eddies in the east australia current and it was completely serendipitous to find this volcano cluster, \" suthers says. \" we can only just imagine what will be around the corner if we continue to scan this area. \" sadly, there is only enough funding to have the \" kick-arse ship, \" the investigator, trolling the ocean for 180 days a year, suthers tells the sydney morning herald. As it's now at dock, the \" inevitable \" underwater volcanoes still undiscovered will have to wait to be found next year. Not only can the investigator search deeper than its predecessor — which could see less than two miles below the surface — but it's also \" an incredibly stable vessel for those of us who are seasick, \" suthers says. \" usually when you're hit by ( 13-foot ) waves you lose a couple of days of research because you're vomiting. \" a volcano expert, who calls the discovery \" enormously exciting, \" says the volcanoes \" tell us part of the story of how new zealand and australia separated around 40 million to 80 million years ago, and they ' ll now help scientists target future exploration of the sea floor to unlock the secrets of the earth's crust. \" ( another ocean discovery: trillions of glow-in-the-dark fanged fish. )",

It will also rate how you look in various outfits using \" machine learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists. \" but the echo look, which will cost $ 200 when it's released, raises some questions. Cnn wonders who amazon's \" fashion specialists \" are and how artificial intelligence can judge individual fashion tastes. And amazon says all photos and videos of users will be stored indefinitely — unless the user specifically deletes them. It hasn't said if it will sell those images and videos to third parties. Amazon may also use your photos to recommend clothing based on your outfits. And motherboard points out the obvious fact it's a potentially hack-able amazon camera in your bedroom or bathroom.

We haven't seen something like this for quite some time, if we've ever seen this type of planning in terms of taking life, \" zappala said.

        "summary": "Pope francis endeared himself to animal lovers this week after he was widely quoted as saying that dogs and other animals can go to heaven. Turns out, it was a different pope who said that. The confusion seems to stem from a misleading headline in an italian newspaper, explains religion news service, and the resulting story then got picked up everywhere ( including newser ). What pope francis actually said last month: \"holy scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us, \" reports the new york times. But then things got confusing. An italian news report suggested that francis might have been talking about animals and heaven, and its analysis included this quote made years ago by pope paul vi, who was consoling a boy whose dog had died: \" paradise is open to all of god's creatures. \" the piece was headlined, \"paradise for animals? the pope doesn't rule it out. \" by the time the story got re-reported around the world in a media equivalent of the game \" telephone, \" it was francis, not pope paul vi, who was consoling the young boy and talking about \" paradise for animals. \" ( the times, for instance, had the incorrectly attributed quote in its original front-page story, but has since appended a correction. ) so what does francis specifically say on the subject? not much. \" a search through the current pope's writings and remarks showed no immediate sign that he has taken a clear position on the question, \" reports cnn ( which also had to correct its original story ). For the record, the times story also reports that pope john paul ii once said that animals have souls, but at least one site thinks that's wrong, too.",

            "Theologians cautioned that francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement. The rev. James martin, a jesuit priest and editor at large of america, the catholic magazine, said he believed that francis was at least asserting that \"god loves and christ redeems all of creation, \" even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals. The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church's history.

        "summary": "She's referred to as \" the black widow of the riviera \" ( not to be confused with the black widow of japan ), and now she has a prison sentence to go with that title. Patricia dagorn was sentenced this week to 22 years for murdering two men and poisoning two more. The victims ranged in age from 60s to 91, and were said to be some of the at least 20 elderly men the 57-year-old met between 2011 and 2012 through a dating agency, online ads, and even on the street, reports the guardian. The bbc explains that dagorn had previously been handed a five-year sentence for fraud and theft, and in the wake of that trial, french authorities decided to take a second look at michel kneffel's july 2011 death; dagorn had lived with him in nice, and police reportedly discovered valium and the financial and medical info of a number of men among her things. What they uncovered led them to look at francesco filippone, an 85-year-old whose decomposed body was found in his tub in february 2011. Ange pisciotta, 82, and robert vaux, 91, had dalliances with dagorn but survived, with vaux describing the much younger woman as \" like a ray of sunshine in winter. \" though after she began to live with him in 2012, his health took a major turn; dagorn had allegedly drugged him with valium. Prosecutors painted her as a serial poisoner who covertly used drugs to weaken her marks and then, per the afp, get the men to give her money ( she cashed a $ 25,000 check from filippone ) or put her in their wills. Dagorn denied the charges against her, and said at trial, \" i won't say that [ what she felt toward the men ] was love, but it was deep friendship. \" ( japan's black widow received a much more severe sentence. )",

Rolf baumann tells cbc news he bomb-proofed the windows in his luxury ottawa townhouse in early 2016 to meet us security standards so that betsy zouroudis, an executive assistant with the embassy, could move in. But after noise complaints from a downstairs neighbor, baumann says zouroudis agreed to move out last april, reports ctv news. When she remained after that date, baumann says he gave her an extension until the end of august. But he says she left two months early — with his key and without paying thousands of dollars in rent — and though subpoenaed, failed to show up at a court hearing. Canada's landlord and tenant board decided zouroudis owed $ 8,625 for unpaid rent and legal fees. But her lawyer stated \" zouroudis is an an agent of a foreign state and as such enjoys immunity from civil matters throughout canada. \" the ontario superior court of justice will decide next month whether diplomatic immunity applies as baumann seeks to garnish zouroudis ' wages. \" if this falls under the umbrella of immunity — what recourse does anybody have? \" he asks. He's not alone in this predicament. Reporting last june on a \" general rise in misbehavior \" by foreign diplomats in canada, cbc noted two landlords allegedly failed to collect $ 48,000 from diplomats. A former chief of protocol in canada previously told the national post that when it comes to unpaid rent, \" we cannot enforce these things. \"",

The reasons for the general rise in misbehaviour over the last two years are not clear, though may be related to outreach programs and tip lines that make it easier to report problems. Under the access to information act, cbc news obtained a series of quarterly reports from the protocol office at canada's global affairs, covering a 27-month period from late 2014 to this spring. Identities of the offenders and their embassies are carefully blacked out under privacy and international-affairs exemptions. The office of protocol, part of global affairs canada, intervenes when there are cases of alleged illegal behaviour by foreign diplomats posted to ottawa. ( wikipedia ) the reports show the number of incidents that required intervention by the protocol office — which has official oversight of the diplomats living here — has risen from single digits each quarter to about two dozen currently. The types of incidents range from being caught in a police roundup of ' johns,'to unpaid tax bills and stiffing local landlords and construction companies. \" failure to pay property taxes on a state-owned property … has resulted in one of the worst debts of this nature attributed to a foreign mission recorded in recent history, \"",
