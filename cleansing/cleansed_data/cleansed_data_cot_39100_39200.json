        "summary": "An american company isn't backing down on its claim that it's entitled to half the haul from the san jose galleon, a treasure-laden spanish ship sunk by the british in 1708 off the coast of colombia. Sea search armada, which is based in washington state, plans to head to the site of the wreck late this year and start pulling up some of its gold, silver, and jewels, the miami herald reports, despite claims by the colombian president that the entire treasure ( estimated to be worth somewhere between $ 1.5 billion and $ 17 billion, per mashable ) belongs to his country. \" if the [ colombian ] navy is ordered to intercept us... There is not much we can do against that many guns and that big of guns, \" ssa's jack harbeston says. The story stretches back to the early 1980s — that's when ssa claims it discovered the \" immediate vicinity \" of the san jose and made a deal with colombia for a percentage of the treasure. Decades of \" legal wrangling \" ensued, per the herald, leading to a 2007 colombian supreme court ruling reaffirming ssa's claim. But then, the bbc reports, colombian president juan manuel santos tweeted last december that the san jose had been found. Santos said the wreck was discovered by scientists, the navy, and a researcher who \" looks like hemingway \" at a site that had never been surveyed before. \" overnight, \" the herald notes, \" ssa was cut out of the picture. \" spain had also laid claim to the treasure. But after discussions with colombia, it proposed last month that the wreck and its treasure remain on the seafloor to avoid conflict, according to colombia reports. An ssa lawyer tells the herald the whole thing can be cleared up easily: \" let's go to the site together, and if it's a different location then we ' ll give up our claim. \" ( this shipwreck was discovered in a desert diamond field. )",

( photo: alex wong, getty images ) richmond, va. — former virginia governor bob mcdonnell, who asked a judge tuesday for mercy for his wife and himself, was sentenced to two years in federal prison for public corruption. Mcdonnell was convicted sept. 4 of trading access to the power of the governor's office for more than $ 165,000 in loans and high-end gifts. Prosecutors had wanted him to spend more than 10 years in prison, but early in the four-hour hearing judge james spencer said federal officials misinterpreted the guidelines, contending the range was more like 78 to 97 months — 6½ to a little more than 8 years. Then spencer discarded the recommendations entirely but rejected the 6,000 hours of intensive community service that mcdonnell's lawyers had suggested. \" it breaks my heart, but i have a duty i can't avoid, \" spencer said in handing down the punishment. \" mrs. Mcdonnell may have allowed the serpent into the mansion,",

District judge james spencer mused on the fairness of the trial, the history of federal sentencing guidelines, the sadness of the case and even what personal knowledge he had of the former governor. Spencer tipped that he would probably impose a lenient term when he talked of how the sentencing guidelines — once mandatory — would now allow him to show some discretion. Referring to a sentence of seven or eight years, he said: \"that would be unfair, it would be ridiculous, under these facts. \" but spencer was somewhat critical of mcdonnell's conduct and those of his supporters. He twice noted efforts to blame maureen mcdonnell, the former first lady of virginia, who was also charged in the case. At one point, he called those who asserted that she had roped the governor into the case \"dangerously delusional. \" later, he said: \"while mrs. Mcdonnell may have allowed the serpent into the mansion, the governor knowingly let him into his personal and business affairs. \" spencer said he was saddened by the entire affair. ​ \"no one wants to see a former governor of this great commonwealth in this kind of trouble, \" he said, but added: \"the jury by its"

( photo: alex wong, getty images ) richmond, va. — former virginia governor bob mcdonnell, who asked a judge tuesday for mercy for his wife and himself, was sentenced to two years in federal prison for public corruption. Mcdonnell was convicted sept. 4 of trading access to the power of the governor's office for more than $ 165,000 in loans and high-end gifts. Prosecutors had wanted him to spend more than 10 years in prison, but early in the four-hour hearing judge james spencer said federal officials misinterpreted the guidelines, contending the range was more like 78 to 97 months — 6½ to a little more than 8 years. Then spencer discarded the recommendations entirely but rejected the 6,000 hours of intensive community service that mcdonnell's lawyers had suggested. \" it breaks my heart, but i have a duty i can't avoid, \" spencer said in handing down the punishment. \" mrs. Mcdonnell may have allowed the serpent into the mansion,",
            "Judge: lengthy sentence ' would be ridiculous ' in a winding, roughly 15-minute speech before he imposed mcdonnell's two-year sentence, u.s. District judge james spencer mused on the fairness of the trial, the history of federal sentencing guidelines, the sadness of the case and even what personal knowledge he had of the former governor. Spencer tipped that he would probably impose a lenient term when he talked of how the sentencing guidelines — once mandatory — would now allow him to show some discretion. Referring to a sentence of seven or eight years, he said: \"that would be unfair, it would be ridiculous, under these facts. \" but spencer was somewhat critical of mcdonnell's conduct and those of his supporters. He twice noted efforts to blame maureen mcdonnell, the former first lady of virginia, who was also charged in the case. At one point, he called those who asserted that she had roped the governor into the case \"dangerously delusional. \" later, he said: \"while mrs. Mcdonnell may have allowed the serpent into the mansion, the governor knowingly let him into his personal and business affairs. \" spencer said he was saddened by the entire affair. ​ \"no one wants to see a former governor of this great commonwealth in this kind of trouble, \" he said, but added: \"the jury by its"

Some workers will get a raise, \" but others — typically the least educated and skilled — will be priced out of the job market and their pay won't rise to $ 9.

There's a reason for that. Eleanor craft at the daily beast points out that minimum wage increases are overwhelmingly popular; one survey last year found almost all democrats, 74 % of independents, and 50 % of republicans in favor. Paul krugman at the new york times, meanwhile, argues that the effects would be \" overwhelmingly positive, \" and benefit \" hard-working but low-paid americans \" without raising government spending. As for the argument that bumping the wage will eliminate jobs, krugman writes that there's plenty of evidence to the contrary, much of it touching on the simple fact that \" workers aren't bushels of wheat. \" they're people, and \" the human relationships involved in hiring and firing \" them are complex. \" one byproduct of this human complexity seems to be that modest increases in wages for the least-paid don't necessarily reduce the number of jobs. \"",

        "summary": "If you've lately found yourself wondering when the worst drought north america has suffered occurred, here's your answer: 1934. At least, as far as the last millennium goes. In a new nasa study, scientists say that a combination of atmospheric conditions ( a high pressure ridge off the west coast that blocked wet weather ) and dust storms ( the product of grass-eviscerating activities like overfarming and overgrazing that left topsoil susceptible to wind ) culminated in the most severe drought in the past 1,000 years. In fact, the dust bowl drought of 1934 was so bad that it was 30 % worse than the next most severe drought, which occurred in 1580, reports nature. Scientists drew this conclusion using an analysis of tree rings between the years 1000 and 2005. The 1934 drought extended across 71.6 % of western north america, while the extent of 2012's drought didn't quite reach 60 %. As io9 reports, drought led to 14 dust storms in 1932 and 38 in 1933, but farmers kept working the land, expecting rain to return. \" as it turns out, the successive dust storms were making the droughts even worse. \" nasa explains why: \" dust clouds reflect sunlight and block solar energy from reaching the surface. That prevents evaporation that would otherwise help form rain clouds, meaning that the presence of the dust clouds themselves leads to less rain. \" while the agricultural practices that led to those dust storms are no longer used today, scientists say the risk of droughts is only going up, and that agricultural producers will need to adapt accordingly. ( the latest drought, meanwhile, is actually causing the west to rise. )",

The trench character was slated to become a regular character in bond films, but goldfinger director guy hamilton nixed the plan.

        "summary": "It was a big night for bernie: the senator from vermont scored an upset win in michigan that is certain to cause some sleepless nights for hillary clinton strategists — though her delegate count is still on track — and gives him momentum heading into some big votes next week. Donald trump, meanwhile, demolished rumors of a trump decline with victories in michigan, mississippi, and hawaii. A roundup of coverage: the new york times looks at how sanders soared to victory in michigan despite polls that had him as far as 30 points behind. He hit clinton hard on trade deals, which are a major worry in michigan and other rust belt states, and spent time in places like kalamazoo that the clinton campaign largely overlooked. Fivethirtyeight probes how the polls managed to get michigan so wrong. One theory: some clinton supporters voted in the gop primary instead to try to stop trump. Trump is now perfectly set up for march 15, when he can effectively end the gop race with wins in ohio and florida, according to the washington post's look at the night's winners and losers. The big loser: marco rubio, who was well below delegate thresholds in most states and may only get one or two from hawaii. Politico looks at the rubio campaign, which it says was flirting with a \" death spiral \" even before last night, while fivethirtyeight explains why he is \" likely to become a political idiom \" if he can't mount a comeback next week. Cnn takes a look at where it all went wrong for the clinton campaign in michigan — and at why her campaign still thinks ohio will not be a problem. The los angeles times reports on how the results highlighted the breadth of trump's support, though exit polls offered glimmers of hope for his rivals.",

Lego toys. As upi notes, the crowdfunding campaign went absolutely crazy: the creators set $ 8,000 as their goal; as of this writing wednesday, the project had raised more than $ 600,000 — and the campaign doesn't end for another month. The campaign has been getting a lot of press, with nimuno loops being called \" genius, \" \" a great idea, \" \" a game-changer, \" and \" so simple that it's surprising lego didn't even think of it yet. \" perhaps the best part? as cnet notes, the tape is soft, unlike actual legos — \" so go ahead and stick this tape to your floor.

        "summary": "It might be the sleeper case of the current supreme court session: a fight over the seemingly humdrum topic of toner cartridges for printers actually has \" potentially momentous importance for modern commerce, \" per the respected scotusblog. On its surface, the case of impression products v. Lexmark international is fairly straightforward: lexmark makes printers, along with the cartridges that provide the toner for those printers. ( in fact, cartridge refills are where printer companies such as lexmark really make their money, explains consumerist. ) impression is a small west virginia company that sells unauthorized refills at a cheaper price — it disabled a computer chip on the cartridges to do so — and lexmark sued to stop them, claiming a violation of patent law. So far, the courts have sided with lexmark, and the supreme court heard arguments this week. The reason for the interest is that the case has implications far beyond printers. It revolves around an arcane patent issue known as \" exhaustion, \" which involves a patent owner's right to control the use of its product once it has been purchased. In this case, for example, aarp has written a brief on behalf of impression because it's worried that drug companies could impose strict restrictions on their drugs, notes fortune. In fact, consumerist writes that the case has implications \" for basically anyone who ever buys anything — so all of us. \" a decision is expected in june, and the justices didn't provide enough clues in their questions for any of the sources to predict which side will win. Either way, it will have \" real economic consequences, \" writes ronald mann at scotusblog. ( neil gorsuch fielded a bizarre question about ducks at his confirmation hearing. )",

The ship, actually made of concrete, was built as a tanker for world war i but didn't launch until 1919 and thus saw no military service. Instead, it turned into \" a historic symbol in santa cruz county, \" explains the san jose mercury news. An amusement company bought the mothballed ship and towed it to seacliff state beach around 1930, retrofitting it with a dance floor and even a swimming pool. That venture lasted just a few years before the ship, connected to land by a pier, became nothing more than a curiosity and a state-owned fishing spot. Decades of storms took their toll, but it wasn't until this weekend that waves finally ripped the ship's stern off and flipped it on its side. \"it's just an unusual january with this active weather, \" a national weather service forecaster tells the santa cruz sentinel, noting that a buoy recorded a record-high wave in the bay of 34 feet. \" with the cement ship, we're starting to see the ramifications. \" ( the coast guard ship that saved lives in the \" perfect storm \" is still above water, for now. )",

        "summary": "The game of thrones duel between oberyn \" the red viper \" martell and gregor \" the mountain \" clegane might seem like an outlandish fantasy construction. But believe it or not, the scene actually echoes some real-life incidents. Longwood university medieval history professor steven isaac breaks down the real events that might have inspired george rr martin in this post. Some highlights: trial by combat was indeed a real thing; isaac cites several, and you can read more about the practice on this wikipedia page. Perhaps the most vivid parallel came in flanders in the unrest of 1127-28, when a man called iron herman accused one guy of steenvoorde of killing a count. Both men fought for themselves, and guy seemed to have the upper hand, at times toying with herman. After a long combat, herman lay on the ground, seemingly done for. But when guy moved to deliver the final blow, herman grabbed his testicles in one hand and pushed him away with the other. Guy had his \" lower parts broken apart, \" and admitted defeat — and was thus convicted and hanged. In the 1150s, two nameless champions faced off to resolve a dispute between stephen of massy and the monks of saint-germain-des-près. The monks ' champion ended the duel by gouging the other man's eye out. Some aspects of martin's duel are indeed fanciful, however. In almost no case were combatants allowed such mismatched armor and weaponry as clegane and martell used, and most champions were actually anonymous. But isaac is ok with that. \" since the line in the middle ages between fact and imagination was occasionally blurry, \" he writes, \" one has to forgive martin if he mixes and matches likewise. \" for more, read isaac's full post.",

Indeed, the product description suggests no other reason for the design other than to add \" a futuristic feel \" to your closet.

That's not to say these \" jindows \" — jeans with windows, obviously — don't have any fans. More than a few twitter users are hoping to snatch them up, reports buzzfeed. But it appears many more are downright confused by the concept. Of course, topshop's products don't always make sense to consumers. One twitter user points out the company also sells jeans that come with a black tulle skirt attached. While cbs los angeles acknowledges that fashion is sometimes \" deeply perplexing, \" it notes nordstrom isn't one to shy away from the bizarre. After all, it once offered up a leather-wrapped rock with an $ 85 price tag — and it sold out.",

        "summary": "Dramatic developments in the hunt for surviving suspects from the paris attacks: at least two are dead and seven more arrested after a huge police raid on an apartment in saint-denis, north of paris, wednesday morning. The big question — whether alleged mastermind abdelhamid abaaoud is among them — remains unclear, reports the ap. He was thought to have been hiding in a safe house in the neighborhood. A woman detonated a suicide belt when police moved in, and a man was killed when a grenade went off, reports the new york times. The police action lasted about seven hours. More: in a speech after the raid, french president francois hollande declared that isis is \" threatening the whole world \" and told lawmakers that france must \" reestablish control of ( its ) frontiers, \" reports the bbc. Fighting terrorism must be the nation's top priority, he said, adding that france \" will remain a country of liberty and culture \" and \" never give in to fear. \" a source tells reuters that the raid on the saint-denis apartment was launched after investigators found a cellphone in a garbage can outside the bataclan concert hall, with a map of the area and a text message saying: \" let's go. \" abaaoud was believed to have orchestrated the attacks from inside syria, and it would be what the washington post calls a \" startling turn of events \" if he did indeed manage to slip back into europe while being hunted by multiple intelligence agencies. The man whose apartment was at the center of the operation claims a friend asked him to put the guests up and he had no idea who they were. \" someone asked me to put two people up for three days and i did them a favor, it's normal, \" he told french tv channel bfmtv, per itv. \" i don't know where they came from, i don't know anything.

The study was highly specific and thus probably can't be applied to the general population, real clear science reports: it dealt with about 300 moms in boston, about 80 % of whom weren't born in the us and most of whom were hispanic — and other studies suggest hispanic cultures drink coffee younger, notes the lead boston researcher. Even so, the results in the journal of human lactation may come as a surprise. Some 15.2 % of respondents said they routinely gave their 2-year-olds coffee. That's 48 mothers giving their kids an average of an ounce of coffee daily. But questions remain over what kind of damage — if any — that could do. \" almost no research exists \" on the subject of caffeine consumption in young kids, notes real clear science, though the researchers found one suggesting that 2-year-olds into coffee and tea faced triple the risk of kindergarten obesity. Five doctors interviewed by livescience for an earlier story all warned against allowing kids to drink much caffeine, with the most lenient of them saying, \" at best it's no harm, at worse, it can cause a lot of side effects that aren't necessary. \" the bottom line, says the boston researcher, is that more study is needed about the coffee-drinking habits of the very young and the particular risks involved.

Between may 2008 and november 2010, the researchers, led by dr. Anne merewood, an associate professor of pediatrics at the boston university school of medicine, enrolled 450 mothers and newborns into a two-year study on child-feeding practices. Each mother received regular telephone check-ins, and was twice queried by a research assistant in-person when the infant reached one and two years of age. Among the questions asked at the two-year check-in was, \" does your child drink coffee? if yes, how many ounces per day? \" of the 315 mothers who completed the year 2 survey, 48 ( 15.2 % ) admitted to feeding their children coffee on a regular basis, at an average rate of roughly an ounce per day.",
            "Abstract background: although introduction of inappropriate foods and liquids in early childhood and their association with breastfeeding is commonly reported in us children, coffee use in very young us children and its association with breastfeeding is not. Objectives: this study aimed to determine the proportion of 1- and 2-year-olds in an urban population consuming coffee, their rate of consumption, and predictors of consumption, including breastfeeding status. Methods: we used data from a prospective cohort study on infant weight gain and diet, and body mass index at age 2. We used bivariate analyses to examine variables associated with coffee consumption at 1 and 2 years and multivariate logistic regression to control for variables of interest. Results: this study included 315 mother-infant dyads. At 1 year, the rate of coffee consumption reported was 2.5 %; at 2 years, it was 15.2 % and average daily consumption was 1.09 oz ( range,",

            "American adults are generally infatuated with coffee, but does the love affair extend back into infancy? a team of doctors at the boston medical center sought to find out. Between may 2008 and november 2010, the researchers, led by dr. Anne merewood, an associate professor of pediatrics at the boston university school of medicine, enrolled 450 mothers and newborns into a two-year study on child-feeding practices. Each mother received regular telephone check-ins, and was twice queried by a research assistant in-person when the infant reached one and two years of age. Among the questions asked at the two-year check-in was, \" does your child drink coffee? if yes, how many ounces per day? \" of the 315 mothers who completed the year 2 survey, 48 ( 15.2 % ) admitted to feeding their children coffee on a regular basis, at an average rate of roughly an ounce per day.",
            "Abstract background: although introduction of inappropriate foods and liquids in early childhood and their association with breastfeeding is commonly reported in us children, coffee use in very young us children and its association with breastfeeding is not. Objectives: this study aimed to determine the proportion of 1- and 2-year-olds in an urban population consuming coffee, their rate of consumption, and predictors of consumption, including breastfeeding status. Methods: we used data from a prospective cohort study on infant weight gain and diet, and body mass index at age 2. We used bivariate analyses to examine variables associated with coffee consumption at 1 and 2 years and multivariate logistic regression to control for variables of interest. Results: this study included 315 mother-infant dyads. At 1 year, the rate of coffee consumption reported was 2.5 %; at 2 years, it was 15.2 % and average daily consumption was 1.09 oz ( range,",

According to the cbc, carleton university was hit with a ransomware attack from an unknown source. \" any system accessible from the main network, that is windows based, may have been compromised, \" the university stated on its website. Ransomware is a virus that keeps people from accessing their files unless they pay up. A graduate student at carleton says the hackers were asking for 39 bitcoin ( about $ 28,500 ) to stop the attack. The university advised students to turn off their computers, stay off the university's wi-fi network, and not send any money to the hackers. Last june, the university of calgary paid hackers $ 15,000 to get out of a ransomware attack, the ottawa citizen reports. Ransomware has also been used against hospitals and public transportation in the us and europe. Despite carleton students having a hard time registering for things and getting their email, it doesn't appear the university is prepared to pay the ransom, with the register reporting the school may be turning to its backups to restore things.

        "summary": "A newly discovered punctuation error regarding a piece of evidence may help british police zero in on accomplices in a notorious murder now 23 years old. The case is that of stephen lawrence, a black teenager beaten to death in 1993 as he stood at a bus stop. Two white men are serving time for the murder, but police think three or four others took part in the attack. Now the leather strap of a bag found at the scene has provided a dna sample from a woman, and if police can track her down, it could lead to more arrests, reports the telegraph. Authorities think the strap was part of a homemade weapon used to kill lawrence — perhaps with the head of a hammer attached — but it was disregarded for years after being mistakenly cataloged as having been found 300 feet from the body. It turns out the strap was actually less than 15 feet away. The gaffe happened because \" the punctuation [ from the scene examiner's notes ] hadn't been read correctly, \" explains the new lead investigator. The exact error isn't revealed, but whoever typed up the examiner's notes grouped the strap with something that was found 300 feet away. Police don't necessarily think the woman who owned the bag took part in the killing, but she might have given it to a relative or friend. Police have asked female relatives of all suspects to provide dna, but so far most have refused, reports the bbc. Police are now offering a $ 26,000 reward for information. Inquiries into the original high-profile investigation raised allegations of institutional racism and police corruption, notes the independent.",

            "Police have now discovered the strap was actually found just 4.5 metres ( 14.7ft ) away from a pool of mr lawrence's blood and eight metres ( 26.2ft ) away from his bag. Officers believe it may have been part of a weapon used to fatally injure the student as he waited for a bus in eltham, south east london, in april 1993. Chris le pere, the senior investigating officer, said it was similar to a homemade weapon found in the home of david norris, one of the men convicted of the murder. The admission comes amid an investigation into alleged police corruption in relation to the murder inquiry, which was launched by the national crime agency ( nca ) last year and is still ongoing.",

He was killed in the crash, though there are squishy reports of a second pilot who bailed, notes the bbc. If true, it's a big embarrassment for the north and a likely sign that the famine is getting even worse.

The lone pilot of the soviet-era mig15 died in the crash in fushun prefecture, liaoning province, on tuesday, sources said yesterday. South korea's yonhap news agency quoted intelligence sources as saying the aircraft may have been en route to russia where the pilot hoped to defect. China has a repatriation pact with north korea, the yonhap report said. China's xinhua news agency issued a brief report saying a probe was under way. Fushun is about 200km away from a north korean air base in the border town of sinuiju. Defections among civilians from north korea are common, but with pyongyang's policy of feeding its soldiers first, military defectors are more unusual. Yonhap said the number of north korean soldiers defecting had increased in recent months as food shortages deepened. North korea's belligerence has increased in recent months with the sinking of the south korean patrol boat cheonan and pyongyang's threats of nuclear war. Observers predict kim jong-il is coming to the end of his leadership with a handover to his youngest son, jong-un, to be announced at next month's korean workers party meeting.

        "summary": "It seems cultural differences are visible at a very early age: less than one year old, to be precise. A new study has found that dutch babies laugh and smile more than us infants, and they cuddle more, too, per a washington state university post at eureka alert. American babies do, however, have the dutch beat when it comes to being noisy, researchers say. They were found to be more vocal and active than those in the netherlands; they also showed more fear, sadness, and frustration, while dutch babies were easier to calm down. The findings were based on surveys of mothers that asked about the occurrence of 191 different baby behaviors at six months and one year of age. Why the differences? researchers have some ideas. Us parents, the study suggests, tend to share a belief in the importance of cognitive stimulation. But \" two things that are very important to dutch parents are reserving specific times for sleep and not over-stimulating their children, \" says maria gartstein, co-author of the study published in the european journal of developmental psychology. ( she notes she was \" struck by \" how little dutch parents incorporate toys in their child play. ) as jesse singal at the science of us puts it: \" as an american baby, every moment you spend cuddling is a moment that baby across the street spends preparing for the ultra-competitive global workplace. \" the researchers hope knowing more about how parents impact a kid's temperament \" will help psychologists fine-tune ways to prevent infant temperament issues from becoming behavioral problems later in life. \" ( looking to bless your independent child with a unique name? fork over $ 32,000. )",

        "summary": "Even babies whose heads appear to be of normal size at birth can go on to develop microcephaly, according to new research out of brazil. Writing in the cdc's morbidity and mortality weekly report, scientists say that of the 13 babies they tracked who were born without any outward signs of microcephaly — but whose brain scans revealed other abnormalities like decreased brain volume — 11 went on to develop microcephaly months later. \" among all infants, head growth was documented to have decelerated as early as 5 months of age, \" per the report. The only remotely good news? their brain damage was less severe than that of babies born with microcephaly, and the researchers noted the babies seemed more capable of interacting socially, as evidenced by smiles and eye contact. Unfortunately the infants ' problems were still serious, including epilepsy and difficulty eating, reports new york magazine. \" we were worried, but now that we've started following those cases, we are very sad, \" one doctor tells the new york times. \" the picture is really terrible. \" the researchers suggest three potential reasons for the post-birth decrease in head growth: that it might be \" the consequence of earlier in utero destruction \" of cells related to brain growth, an immune system response to the original infection, or continued infection of neural cells, though \" the last seems less likely \" as tests on seven babies showed no active zika virus.

The charms manual includes everyday tips and remedies, including how to alleviate menstrual cramps, soothe a toothache ( use a dead man's tooth, obviously ), and craft a super-strong key. It also enters \" um … ok \" territory, including details on how to chat with spirits and the ominous-sounding \" activate the seal of solomon. \" of the 522 pages contained in the three books, about 350 have been at least partially transcribed, a library rep told chicagoist last week — and the library wants the public to get in on the act and help transcribe and translate the remainder.

Researchers looked at almost 40,000 patients in ontario, canada, and found that among those who had daytime procedures carried out by a doctor who had worked sometime between midnight and 7am, the risk of complications was 22.2 %, and the risk was an almost identical 22.4 % among those whose doctors hadn't been working the night before, the los angeles times reports. Sleep deprivation \" can impair mood, cognitive performance, and psychomotor function, \" but apparently not among surgeons, the study authors write in the new england journal of medicine. Lead researcher dr. Nancy baxter of the university of toronto tells reuters that while the study shows people probably don't need to worry if their specialist is short on sleep, she doesn't want it to be \" open season \" for doctors to work when fatigued \" without understanding your abilities. \" she says the reason lack of sleep seems to make no difference may be because surgeons are good at regulating themselves and have enough experience to work when tired. The chief of the division of sleep disorders at brigham and women's hospital in boston, isn't convinced by the study: he tells reuters that this study didn't actually measure how much sleep the surgeons actually got, and his own research has shown that complications soar when it's under six hours.",

To date, most of the literature on sleep deprivation and performance has focused on medical trainees.

However, few studies have examined the effects of sleep deprivation on the performance of attending physicians, and the results have been conflicting. In 2009, rothschild et al.

The boy, who has been appearing in public with lukashenko since he was 4, is the youngest of the leader's three sons and it isn't clear who his mother is, though she's rumored to be a personal doctor who became one of lukashenko's mistresses. The bbc notes that lukashenko has previously dismissed talk of political grooming, explaining his son's constant presence by saying that nikolai is so devoted to him that the boy can't sleep when he's away.

Lukashenko's re-election five years ago led to mass protests and the imprisonment of leading opposition figures, but support for his 20-year-old regime has risen since he cast himself as a guarantor of stability in the face of an economic crisis and a pro-russian separatist conflict in neighbouring ukraine.

The 34-year-old canadian man was riding his motorcycle june 1 when he was t-boned by a car, cbc reports. Bari's family is now facing the possibility of bankruptcy, but that wouldn't be if the crash had happened just 12 hours earlier. Bari suffered brain trauma, broken bones, and more in the crash, in which he was determined not to be at fault. He was so severely injured that police initially pronounced him dead. The father of two was in a coma for nearly a month and was only released from the hospital a few weeks ago. Bari's injuries would have been considered catastrophic — had ontario not changed its auto insurance guidelines the day before. Under the old guidelines, bari would have been entitled to up to $ 2 million in compensation from the accident, lawyer mike smitiuch says. Instead, bari received just $ 86,000. \" adam has the same amount of money available to him as somebody who broke their toe, \" his wife, courtney bari, says. Adam bari is currently unable to work — it's unclear if he ' ll ever be able to return to his old job — and courtney bari has had to go down to one day a week while she takes care of him. Meanwhile, medical bills are piling up, and supporters have resorted to a gofundme page that seems to have drawn renewed attention after the media coverage, as well as charity golf tournaments.",

The cdc warns that the rare bacterial disease \" rabbit fever, \" or tularemia — spread by ticks and rabbits — has turned up in 100 people across four states as of sept. 30. Usually, these states report a combined total of 20 cases annually, reports live science. One 85-year-old man died, while 48 others were hospitalized. Colorado has seen the most cases at 43, followed by nebraska at 21, south dakota at 20, and wyoming at 16. Experts aren't sure why there's been such an uptick this year, but more rabbits and greater awareness may be factors. The cdc notes the disease is spread when humans touch an infected animal, consume contaminated food or water, breathe in contaminated air, or are bitten by infected ticks. It can't be passed from person to person, reports medical daily. Symptoms depend on how a person is infected: someone who touches an infected animal may get skin ulcers, while someone who breathes in particles may develop throat and lung issues. Other symptoms include fever, muscle or joint pain, trouble breathing, pink eye, swollen or ruptured lymph nodes, stomach pain, and sepsis. The disease can usually be successfully treated with antibiotics. \" residents and visitors to these areas should regularly use insect repellent, wear gloves when handling animals, and avoid mowing in areas where sick or dead animals have been reported, \" per the cdc.

Which might not be that unusual, except for one thing: \" he's not the defendant, \" observes a headline about the case in the aba journal. No, benito vasquez-hernandez, is merely a material witness, and prosecutors fear he won't show up for the trial if they let him go, explains the oregonian. As a result, vasquez-hernandez has been locked up for about 900 days now, which the newspaper says might make him the longest-held witness in the nation. At one point, no. 2 on that list was probably his 28-year-old son moises, who was held for 727 days before being released last fall with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. His lawyers think prison literally drove him crazy. Another of vasquez-hernandez's sons, eloy, is accused of murdering a 55-year-old female co-worker. Prosecutors say eloy told his father and brother about the crime, and they need their testimony at trial. While moises was eventually able to give a video deposition, benito lost his chance when he kept asking why he was in jail and insisting on his innocence, and the frustrated judge yelled, \" get him out here, \" reports the oregonian. His lawyers say they couldn't get him to fully understand what was happening. \" i sincerely regret keeping this man locked up, \" said a deputy district attorney. \" but i don't see any alternative that is fair to these people, \" he added, referring to the victim's family. \" i ' m trying to convict a man who has confessed to killing a mother.

Her brother tells the chronicle that police were called saturday morning after conley arrived at the home \" armed and angry, \" and that they should have \" kicked down that door instantly \" given the couple's history.

            "Aging in the 21st century is all about risk and its reduction. Insurers reward customers for regular attendance at a gym or punish them if they smoke. Physicians are warned by pharmaceutical companies that even after they have prescribed drugs to reduce their patients ' risk of heart disease, a \"residual risk \" remains — more drugs are often prescribed. One fitness product tagline captures the zeitgeist: \"your health account is your wealth account! long live living long! \" but when is it time to stop saving and spend some of our principal? if you thought you were going to die soon, you just might light up, as well as stop taking your daily aspirin, statin and blood pressure pill. You would spend more time and money on present pleasures, like a dinner out with friends, than on future anxieties. When it comes to prevention, there can be too much of a good thing. Groups like the united states preventive services task force regularly review the evidence that supports prevention guidelines, and find that after certain ages, the benefits of prevention are not worth the risks and hassles of testing, surgeries and medications. Recent guidelines for cholesterol treatment from the american college of cardiology and the american heart association, for example, set 79 years as the upper limit for calculating the 10-year risk of developing or dying",

At the trial of alleged killers siti aisyah of indonesia and doan thi huong of vietnam, a government toxicologist testified that kim was carrying 12 bottles of atropine, an antidote to nerve agents like the vx that killed him, the bbc reports. The two women are accused of rubbing the vx agent on kim's face at kuala lumpur's airport on feb. 12 in an attack that he had apparently been living in fear of. \" if you know someone is coming after you with a nerve agent, atropine is a key drug you would want to carry, \" pharmaceutics expert nial wheate tells cnn. Kim, the exiled half-brother of north korean leader kim jong un, requested medical attention at an airport clinic. He had a seizure soon afterward and died in an ambulance. It's not clear why he apparently didn't attempt to use the antidote, though wheate says swallowing it in tablet form may not have helped against a nerve agent as fast-acting as vx, since it takes around 20 minutes to become effective. Doan and siti claim they were tricked into wiping the toxin on kim's face, the bbc reports. Their trial, which began two months ago, has now gone into recess until next year, reports the ap.

And virginia thorley, a lactation consultant who has been investigating the limited research available on exclusive pumping and its consequences, says that while most moms think of pumping as a way of having it all, this upward trend could be presenting a few problems. Those include less skin-to-skin contact, broken-down nutrients in the pumped milk, more bacteria introduced into the milk, and fewer health benefits for the mother, reports pacific standard. \" promotion of breast-milk feeding as identical to breastfeeding is misleading, \" she says. \" the new challenge is to use language accurately, and tell mothers the truth that feeding their milk to their babies by bottle is less than equivalent to breastfeeding, \" thorley adds. She acknowledges that some women exclusively pump out of necessity — the baby doesn't latch well, for instance — and that women who choose to pump over buying formula are still offering the better option. ( one blogger says that pumping, \" like direct nursing, is a labor of love, \" reports the huffington post. ) but thorley says that even with a dearth of research on the subject, there is already evidence that babies who drink mainly by bottle are often overfed, and that babies who nurse have fewer ear infections thanks in part to their body position while they nurse.

And now, 70 years after one flight met its end in a crash outside a town in italy, locals have found the wreckage and historians have pieced together the puzzle of the aircraft's final flight, reports discovery. It turns out the fragments found in selva del lamone belonged to a b-24h from the air force's 736th bomb squadron, which operated out of southern italy. It had taken off in march 1944 with 276 other bombers and was part of an 18-bomber formation that dropped 25 tons of bombs on an airport. But \" weather conditions and clouds prevented accurate bombing, \" says a historian. \" only half of the bombers actually dropped their loads. \" when germans attacked the b-24h, the week reports, only two sergeants managed to parachute out, though both ended up in german prison camps. A grisly crash scene greeted italian villagers, says the historian: \" carbonized bodies were scattered around the wreckage, a body was hanging from a tree with his parachute. \" the wreckage fragments are set to go on display by year's end.

All that remains is the wreck of the turret, now on display at a local museum in bolsena, italy. Of the wrecked bomber's 10 men, three were captured by the germans and finished out the war in a pow camp. The remaining seven were saved and hidden from the germans by italian families. Truesdale also left his turret and let the name of his wife plunge in the water with the plane. Truesdale was among the crewmen captured by the germans and taken in a pow camp. He managed to escape and remained hidden for three months until the arrival of the allies. The plane crashed into lake bolsena, the largest volcanic lake in europe. All 10 men parachuted to the ground. Once near perugia, the group encountered heavy fire from german anti-aircraft. Seven b-17s in the first wave and 18 in the second suffered serious damage. \" ethel's \" two engines were struck and damaged and the bomber spun out of control. \" ethel \" flew for the last time on jan. 15, 1944. The final flight was part of a mission which involved the use of 38 b-17 flying fortresses divided into two waves. The primary target was the railroad bridge in the town of certaldo, south of florence. The alternate target was a marshalling yards at poggibonsi, near siena. Writing a lover's name on the plane wasn't just truesdale's idea. When it came to name their plane, the entire crew agreed to call it \" ethel, \" after the girlfriend of right waist gunner, anthony brodniak. The b-17 plane is shown at left. At right antony brodniak poses with his girlfriend, ethel. It turned out the words referred to lois eileen, the young wife of gunner sgt. Ralph truesdale.

The 45-year-old german native was stopped for questioning at rome's ciampino airport on tuesday in connection with the apparent disappearance of his wife, li yinglei, and taken into custody. He has not been charged, but a judge ruled friday that he must remain in jail until prosecutors make a decision, reports the irish times. The irish independent reports the family boarded the luxury magnifica cruise ship in civitavecchia, italy, and records show li reboarded the ship on the 10th after it docked in genoa. After that, there's no record of the 36-year-old — nor any record of belling alerting anyone to the fact that his wife had seemingly vanished. The crew's count of passengers exiting the ship at the cruise's culmination returned one person less than expected, and li, who the telegraph reports went by the name angie, was ultimately determined to be missing. Luigi conti, a lawyer for belling, says li stayed aboard the ship at a stop in greece and was gone when the rest of her family returned. Belling, he says, wasn't alarmed because she has previously left family vacations. He adds that belling's \" behavior after disembarking was not that of a person who was trying to flee. He simply headed to ciampino airport with his children [ ages 4 and 6 ] to catch the flight that he had booked. \" a report in italy's la stampa picked up by the media quotes a genoa shopowner who recalled seeing the couple on the 10th, and describes belling as handing his wife sneakers and saying \" put these on instead of your sandals and shut up. \" ( eleven years after a teacher's disappearance, there's a murder charge. )",

Trump, who was incensed about the rising levels of migrants and threatened to shut down the southern border on twitter earlier that morning, took bolton's side during the argument. Bolton favors a harder line approach to the issue and criticized department of homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen during the argument, a source said. Nielsen used to serve as kelly's deputy when he ran dhs. Bolton reportedly said nielsen needed to start doing her job, which incensed kelly. The president, who sources say was present for the beginning of the shouting match, later denied knowledge of it. \" i've not heard about it. No, \" trump told reporters before boarding air force one to fly to montana on thursday afternoon. White house press secretary sarah sanders did not deny the incident, and instead pushed blame onto democrats in a statement later thursday, insisting that her colleagues are \" not angry at one another. \" \" while we are",
            "Listen to article 2: 14 photographer: pablo martinez monsivais/ap photographer: pablo martinez monsivais/ap president donald trump's chief of staff and his national security adviser engaged in a heated argument outside the oval office on thursday, according to three people familiar with the episode. The chief of staff, john kelly, and the national security adviser, john bolton, fought over immigration and border crossings, including the performance of the homeland security department under secretary kirstjen nielsen, one person familiar with the matter said. She was at the white house for meetings on thursday, but the people disagreed about whether she witnessed the argument. Bolton criticized dhs, and kelly defended nielsen, a former deputy whom he supported to replace him at the department. Two people described the exchange as less a shouting match than an intense argument. Kelly then stormed away, so upset that he uttered some profanities. Bolton and nielsen had a good conversation after kelly and bolton's argument, a white house official said. Both believe the goal is to protect the border, the official said. Trump has lately expressed fury about a large group of migrants who are traveling from honduras toward the u.s. Border. He vowed thursday to deploy the military and shut down the mexican border unless the migrants are turned back..... In addition to stopping all payments"

Turns out that he has another kinda strange new interest: graffiti. He bought an industrial workspace in manhattan about six months ago and has since been spotted around the neighborhood, clothes splashed with paint, after working late nights behind closed doors. But last month, he \" tagged \" his studio door with a levitating figure he calls \" baba \" and the initials \" ffc. \" baba was soon painted over by city officials, leading carrey to re-tag his door with an even bigger image. In a recent interview — which the daily beast calls \" contemplative and uncharacteristically subdued \" — carrey explained to tmz that people aren't sure what's up with the studio and the tagging, but that he's \" being creative \" and \" can't wait for people to see the art. \" the beast notes that carrey has talked about his artistic inclinations as far back as 2008, and started tweeting pictures of his canvases last year.

On thursday, the mayor of florida's miami-dade county ended a 2013 policy that kept local jails from holding undocumented immigrants for federal immigration authorities. While trump called the move by carlos gimenez \" strong! \" and the \" right decision, \" the more than 100 protesters who showed up friday at county hall disagreed. According to nbc miami, protesters accused gimenez, himself an immigrant, of turning his back on his community, calling his caving to trump's executive order \" disgusting. \" gimenez's office received hundreds of emails and dozens of calls from people upset about his decision. The mayor is framing his choice as a fiscal decision, slate reports. He says money, not morals, was responsible for the passing of the policy in 2013, and it was responsible for getting rid of it thursday. He says miami-dade gets \" millions and millions of dollars \" in federal aid. One activist protesting friday disagreed, saying the policy \" was about protecting families. \" more than half of miami-dade residents were born outside the us. But while miami-dade was never comfortable with the \" sanctuary \" label, other sanctuary jurisdictions — new york city, chicago, and california, to name a few — are keeping policies in place despite trump's executive order, which legal experts say may not stand up in court. Meanwhile, miami-dade could now face lawsuits for detaining undocumented immigrants without a warrant.",

        "summary": "It may seem practical to keep fruits and veggies from spoiling by storing them in the fridge, but there's one variety that should stay out on the counter. The new york times reports on new research out of the university of florida that finds when tomatoes are harbored in temps typically found in refrigerators, their flavor weakens, and some of that flavor doesn't come back. The study published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences suggests that chilling tomatoes can cause \" altered volatile synthesis \" and \" transient changes in dna methylation \" — a fancy way of saying that even when the tomatoes are brought back to room temperature, the genes that make a tomato taste like a tomato have been \" turned off, \" and the change is irreversible, per the los angeles times. Study lead author harry klee compares it to a symphony in which the violins and woodwinds have been taken out. \" you still have noise, but it's not the same. \" for a tasty tomato — made up of a complex mixture of acids, sugars, and chemicals known as volatile organic compounds — it's necessary for an \" orchestra of 30 or more chemicals in the right balance. \" klee's team stored heirlooms and other tomatoes for a week in a chilly ( around 40 degrees fahrenheit ) environment, followed by a recovery period at 68 degrees, per phys.org. The tomatoes went into \" shock \" while chilling, and even after a full day back at room temperature, they didn't regain their former gastronomical glory in terms of taste. Even if you're diligent about keeping tomatoes away from the cold, the la times notes tomatoes found at the market are often kept chilled both at distribution hubs and at the store itself.

Mostly they will receive pensions. \" coates also addresses public policy affecting people not only by class, but by race ( he even took on president obama on this topic ), as well as the obama/mlk concepts of \" hope \" and \" dreams \" — concepts that coates believes, per wallace-wells, \" gave white liberals a pass. \" coates also isn't terribly optimistic the race problem here will ever disappear, writing, \" chaos is what we have. … if to the end of its existence america harbors white supremacy, i don't know how remarkable that would be. \" coates'truths are receiving acclaim: as the intelligencer notes, ao scott tweeted recently that the book is \" essential, like water or air. \" and novelist toni morrison gave coates perhaps the greatest compliment of all: \" i've been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after james baldwin died.

        "summary": "Say the word \" chemo \" and what comes to mind? cancer? nausea? hair loss? it seems that final association is, for some, becoming a thing of the past. The new york times reports that some breast cancer patients are hanging on to the hair on their head, even as other hair falls out, by literally freezing their scalps. The technology isn't new: the nonprofit rapunzel project reports cold-cap therapy has been used in europe for two decades, but pilot programs are now beginning to appear throughout the us. Wfsb in the fall reported on one such program at connecticut's norwalk hospital, which is using the penguin cold cap. The gel-filled, swim-cap-like device is frozen to roughly minus 22 degrees fahrenheit and is worn for seven hours before, during, and after chemo — putting the hair follicles in a state of hibernation so they don't absorb the chemo drugs. \" it's like a brain freeze you get when you're eating ice cream, \" one patient told wfsb, and that's not the only uncomfortable element. A new frozen cap must be applied after 30 minutes; considering the length of the process, the times reports some women spend up to $ 750 a day on \" cappers \" — people hired to take the caps on and off. That's on top of what wfsb reports is about a $ 2,000 cost to rent the caps. Insurance rarely covers the expense, though the times reports that could change if the fda approves a brand called dignicap, which was the subject of a pilot study whose results haven't been published yet. In the hospital's two years of offering the penguin cap, 15 women have lost no more than 20 % of the hair on their head, though dr. Richard zelkowitz notes, \" you can only use it in certain chemotherapy regimens. \" to wit, the times reports patients with blood cancer should not use it.

The money will go out by june 30, the boston globe reports. \" if the governor and the mayor have made one thing clear to me, it's get the money out the door, \" feinberg said. More than 100 people came out for the meeting, many asking about compensation for their loved ones. One woman wanted to know if her daughter, who had already lost one leg, would receive less compensation if her other badly injured one wasn't amputated by the deadline. Cases like that make feinberg's job difficult. \" it's solomonic, really, \" he told andrea mitchell at msnbc. ( families of the three who died and victims who lost two limbs or suffered permanent brain damage are set to receive the highest level of compensation. ) but the fund's current balance is fairly impressive; feinberg ran similar funds after the aurora and virginia tech shootings, which pulled in $ 5 million and $ 7 million, respectively, he said on morning joe.",

The study could help develop an improved method of testing consciousness in brain-injured patients, the verge reports. The man's brain was active in regions linked to the processing of sensory information, as well as regions linked to higher cognition. \" the first two times i watched the film, i was on the edge of my seat, \" says another researcher. \" this is what we think is happening with the patient. We think he is understanding it and following it. \" but, warns a cognitive neuroscientist not involved with the study, \" i would think of activity in these systems more as a marker of a particular aspect of conscious experience, \" rather than consciousness itself. That may be good enough for the 34-year-old and his dad: \" the fact that we can say he is enjoying these movies, he can understand these movies, says something about his quality of life, \" the lead author says of the subject, adding that his father was reassured to find out that going to the movies \" was indeed something that his son was understanding — something that he was benefiting from — and that he should keep doing. \" ( this 24-year-old just found out she's missing a key part of her brain. )",

So when a military-style helicopter descended on her garden ( which is fenced in, away from neighbors ) on sept. 21, and uprooted the plant that was almost ready for harvest, her son, who was home at the time, tells the daily hampshire gazette that it was \" shocking \" and \" scary as hell. \" holcomb is technically growing the plant illegally in a state that has approved medical marijuana use because she has no card, though full legalization of recreational use is on the ballot next month, reports reason. \"i had been nursing this baby through a drought, and i was pretty pissed to tell you the truth, \" holcomb tells the boston globe. A state police spokesman said the national guard and state police conducted a widespread raid of 44 plants on multiple area properties, seizing the plants but not pressing any charges. Holcomb's son questions whether the state is using due process in fly-by raids without warrants, while his mom warns: \" you have overstepped, and i am not going to step aside. \" for now, holcomb says she's worried about the cost of getting medical marijuana and says she may just plant another seed for next year.

A march 24 reading at the esperanza base south of argentina registered a balmy 63.5 degrees fahrenheit, which is more than 30 degrees above average for that time of year and may be the highest temp ever recorded on the continent, the weather underground blog notes. The nearby marambio base had registered a record high of 63.3 degrees the day before, per the guardian. Also worrisome, though not conclusive: a study in science that indicates a 70 % increase in the loss of western antarctic ice-shelf volume over a 10-year period, while ice gains on eastern antarctic shelves ground to a halt, the guardian notes. However, researchers aren't ready quite yet to definitively point the finger. \" while it is fair to say that we're seeing the ice shelves responding to climate change, we don't believe there is enough evidence to directly relate recent ice-shelf losses specifically to changes in global temperature, \" a university of california-san diego glaciologist tells reuters uk.

        "summary": "Putting the word \" exotic \" in front of \" tick \" doesn't make the arachnid any more appealing, especially since one type is now proliferating across the us and bringing potential sicknesses with them. Usa today reports on a new warning from the cdc, which notes that the \" fast-multiplying \" asian longhorned tick first made an appearance in august 2017 on a new jersey sheep ( one had previously been found there, in 2013 on a dog ), and has since spread to at least eight other states — new york, pennsylvania, connecticut, maryland, virginia, west virginia, north carolina, and arkansas. The ticks have dug in not just on livestock, but also on pets, animals in the wild, and humans, and they've been spotted as well in environmental samples. \" we are concerned that this tick, which can cause massive infestations... Is spreading in the united states, \" a cdc director notes. What makes the tick particularly concerning is that a female can shoot out up to 2,000 eggs at a time without mating help from a male — meaning one person or animal can end up as an unfortunate host to thousands of ticks. An unfed asian longhorned tick can survive for up to a year. Health officials aren't sure whether the asian longhorned tick can spread lyme disease, but what it can spread is bad enough. Forbes notes those sicknesses have included a trio of \" nasty \" viruses, including the sfts and heartland viruses, as well as other disease-carrying microbes, though there've been no reports yet of any of those illnesses being transmitted in the us by the tick. Livestock in particular has been affected by this critter in australia and new zealand, where it's been capable of reducing dairy production by 25 %. ( an insecticide that can give ticks \" hot feet \" so they fall off of you. )",

Kanye west's new apparel line — which urges blacks to ditch the democrats in a so-called \" blexit \" — was unveiled saturday at turning point usa's young black leadership summit in washington, dc, a meeting for young black conservatives, per the new york post. \" blexit is a renaissance and i am blessed to say that this logo, these colors, were created by my dear friend and fellow superhero kanye west, \" says tpusa communications director candace owens. West didn't attend but was there \" in spirit, \" she says. The apparel line includes shirts featuring a human form in the shape of an \" x \" and the text \" blexit \" or \" we free, \" per the guardian. The release coincided with politically charged messages like owens tweeting an image of maga and blexit caps side-by-side, and articles on blexit.com depicting democrats as racists and republicans as heroes. But vanity fair notes that owens, also a tv pundit and youtube star, later downplayed the political angle, saying, \" let's not politicize love. \" she also appeared to backpedal on west's creative input: \" i said on stage that my friend and fellow superhero helped me design the ' x ' for blexit....

Among other things, it bars employees from working for \" any business which derives more than 10 % of its revenue from selling submarine, hero-type, deli-style, pita, and/or wrapped or rolled sandwiches \" within 3 miles of any jimmy john's... For two years after leaving jimmy john's. The two lawsuits against the company relate to accusations of wage theft, but one suit was amended last month with a mention of the \" oppressive \" agreement. On jezebel, ca pinkham calls the clause \" utterly psychotic, \" noting \" this has nothing to do with the divestment of company secrets and everything to do with putting workers in as desperate a situation as possible where they're terrified to lose or leave their jobs. \" the new york times notes that the huffington post doesn't have proof that jimmy john's has actually enforced the noncompete, and it points out that low-wage workers are increasingly being made to sign such agreements. As for the allegations of wage theft, as the huffington post explained in august, two employees say they were often forced to keep working after their managers clocked them out, because jimmy john's stores are given payroll budgets that are too low. They want class-action status because they say the problem stems from \" corporate set policies \" that would apply to other employees. ( wage theft lawsuits are on the rise in the us. )",

In a freak accident described by the abc, the cattle worker was herding the animals in his charge when one bull \" cleaned me up and kicked my hand up against the rail, \" he says, resulting in the thumb on his right hand being severed. \" my thumb was still hanging on the rail … when i got up off the ground, \" the 20-year-old says. His co-workers tried their best to preserve the thumb for reattachment, placing it on ice in a cooler, but two surgeries to put mitchell's thumb back in place failed, the bbc reports. That's when doctors came up with another suggestion, one mitchell initially balked at: transfer one of his big toes to where his thumb used to be. Mitchell's lead surgeon, sean nicklin, understood the man's reluctance at first, calling it a \" bit of a crazy idea. \" \" [ patients ] do not want to be injured in another part of their body, \" he tells the bbc, adding that big toes aren't as necessary for balance and walking as people believe. But as the thumb is incredibly important function-wise, mitchell eventually gave in. Nicklin explains to the abc that the big toe is surprisingly compatible for a thumb switch: nerves sync up nicely, and it looks more like a thumb ( albeit a giant one ) than any other remedies they may have come up with. The eight-hour surgery went well, and mitchell is expected to have a year or so of rehab in front of him before he heads back into the fields. See photos here. ( why a 911 call about a severed thumb led to a beef-jerky plant worker's firing. )",
