        "summary": "President obama will formally announce janet yellen as his pick to run the fed today, in a move that seems to be garnering widespread praise in the financial industry. Here's what you need to know about the prospective chief: she cares a lot about jobs: most of yellen's academic research has centered on the effects of unemployment, the wall street journal reports, and it suggests that she's likely to keep the economic stimulus coming. She has argued previously that in times of high unemployment, there's little risk of inflation, and so far she's been right. But she also cares about inflation: she was crucial in setting the target at 2 %, arguing that letting it fall too low was as risky as letting it get too high — a view now embedded in the fed's philosophy. She saw the crash coming: in 2005 she wrote that \" there is a ' bubble ' element \" in the housing market due to low mortgage rates, and that if prices fell, it could damage spending and upend the economy, bill conerly at forbes points out. The journal adds that yellen is, according to its analysis, the most accurate forecaster at the fed. Banks can expect a tight leash: yellen has said the crisis turned her from a \" docile \" regulator into one \" strongly inclined... Toward tougher standards and built-in rules. \" economists like her: the nomination \" will be greeted well by market agents. It should be, \" one economist told the journal. Another said she is \" simply more qualified for the job than any of her predecessors, \" while still another called her \" a real mensch \" with \" genuine integrity and humanity. \" new boss, same as the old boss: most observers expect a smooth policy transition. \" she was the least likely of all the chairperson candidates to rock the boat, \" a jp morgan economist says. The washington post says her biggest challenge will be deciding when and how to unwind quantitative easing, a policy she championed.",

The court, which fixed february 5 for starting the trial, also charged them with murder of the paramedic girl under section 302 ( murder ) of the ipc which entails the maximum punishment of death penalty. Additional sessions judge yogesh khanna concluded that there were facts prima facie to suggest that the accused, along with another juvenile associate, conspired to deceitfully induce the girl and her male friend to board the vehicle believing it to be a chartered bus for raping the victim and committing other offences. The accused bus driver ram singh, his brother mukesh, vinay sharma, pawan gupta and akshay singh pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

A fresh offence under section 366 of the indian penal code was added by the court against them for abducting the girl with the intention to compel and force her to ' illicit intercourse '. The court, which fixed february 5 for starting the trial, also charged them with murder of the paramedic girl under section 302 ( murder ) of the ipc which entails the maximum punishment of death penalty. Additional sessions judge yogesh khanna concluded that there were facts prima facie to suggest that the accused, along with another juvenile associate, conspired to deceitfully induce the girl and her male friend to board the vehicle believing it to be a chartered bus for raping the victim and committing other offences. The accused bus driver ram singh, his brother mukesh, vinay sharma, pawan gupta and akshay singh pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The sixth accused, which the police in the charge sheet claimed to be most brutal among them, has been declared ' minor ' by the juvenile justice board, which will try him. However, the fast track court in the order described the juvenile as an ' associate ' of the five accused"

Wafb reports that a final resting vessel was commissioned long ago for the renowned evangelist, with a request it be built by the inmates at the louisiana state penitentiary, aka angola. The advocate notes graham's son franklin was the one who originally saw the funerary handiwork of angola's prisoners ( they made coffins for fellow inmates ) when he visited the prison in the early 2000s and asked that coffins be made for both of his parents, according to burl cain, the former warden at the facility. A louisiana department of corrections spokesperson confirms that billy graham's wife, ruth, was buried in an angola casket after she died in june 2007.

        "summary": "Sulfur dioxide is a bad thing, right? indeed, it's been linked to acid rain, crop failures, and respiratory problems — but scrubbing it from the atmosphere has also apparently caused arctic sea ice to melt, the anchorage daily news reports. According to a new study from environment canada, recent reductions in sulfur-dioxide and other aerosols have enabled more solar heat to reach the ice. Study authors say that should cause roughly 400,000 square miles of sea-ice melt, which is about 25 % to 40 % of the seasonal total, depending on the extent of future greenhouse gas emissions. But that shouldn't stop us from keeping our air clean, says study author nathan gillett: \" we want to avoid that interpretation, \" he says. \" we're really just pointing out that it's part of the picture and should be considered, \" adds gillett. \" we're not trying to weigh costs and benefits of sulfur dioxide here. \" human-caused sulfur dioxide emissions — which come from burning fossil fuels like coal — have fallen dramatically in the us and the european union. Even china has been cutting back on emissions with clean-air plans, technological changes to power plants, and a new cap-and-trade program. But humans aren't entirely to blame: volcanic eruptions are among the natural sources of sulfur dioxide and have at times been blamed for mass extinctions in earth's past. A new study, however, finds that while volcanoes may have been involved in such catastrophes, \" sulfur gases were not the main agent, \" a study co-author tells berkeley news.",

            "The climatic and environmental effects of lava flows and sulfur emissions that lasted for years or decades in earth's past were likely much less severe than scientists once thought, according to a new study by scientists in europe and the united states. These so-called flood basalts, along with explosive supervolcano eruptions and asteroid impacts, have often been invoked, alone or in combination, to explain the five mass extinction events that have befallen earth over the past 300 million years, including the cretaceous extinction that saw the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. But while volcanic eruptions and asteroid impacts can propel gas and dust into the atmosphere and alter climate for years, the impact of years of sulfur dioxide emissions from flood basalt lava flows – including acid rain and fog – is unknown. At their peak, such eruptions would have filled 150 olympic-size swimming pools every minute. A global model simulation of the spread of the gas and aerosol particles combined with data on several past eruptions suggests that the reality during and after such an eruption was likely much less grim than assumed. Only if such flood basalts oozed for hundreds of years without interruption might the climatic impacts have had a more severe effect on plants and animals, the researchers concluded. \"perhaps most intriguingly, we found that the effects of acid rain on vegetation were rather selective; that is, vegetation in some but not all parts of the world would have died off, whereas in other areas the effects would have been negligible, \" said study leader anja schmidt, an academic research fellow in the school of earth and environment at the university of leeds in the united kingdom. The new findings will challenge the earth sciences community as a whole to re-examine the causes of mass extinctions and the role of volcanism, said co-author stephen self, an adjunct professor in the department of earth and planetary sciences at uc berkeley. \"it's a possibility that volcanism was involved, but that sulfur gases were not the main agent, as has been suggested by other workers in recent years, \" he said. \"the results are not unexpected considering recent work on aerosol particles from other types of eruptions, but now we have to put on our thinking caps to understand what about these massive lava flows, if not sulfur, leads to widespread plant and animal die-offs. \" the scientists published their new study online nov. 23 in the journal nature geoscience.

Still, some states with similar student loan debts can have significantly different income levels, which can dramatically change how big the relative debt burden is. Massachusetts and alabama have nearly identical average student loan debts, at $ 29,391 and $ 29,425, respectively. However, the typical household in massachusetts with a 25-44 year old head of household is $ 77,266 — $ 30,724 greater than the typical household in alabama. So while the student loan debt is equal to 63 % of the median yearly household income for in alabama, it is only equal to 38 % in of the income massachusetts.

In a technological advance that supporters say could be as important as seat belts, the national highway traffic safety administration has rolled out a prototype vehicle with alcohol-detecting breath sensors and touch points that stop drivers over the legal alcohol limit from operating it, the detroit news reports. Nhtsa administrator mark rosekind says the driver alcohol detection system for safety — dadss — is a \" huge step forward \" that could be up and running by 2020. The system has been in the works since 2008. Rosekind says that as long as dadss can be made instant and foolproof, the public — especially parents and operators of commercial fleets — will wonder how they lived without it, the news reports. The advances that made it possible are a result of improved bomb detection systems after 9/11, reports the washington post, which notes that although drunk-driving deaths have halved over the last 30 years, there were still more than 10,000 in 2013. Not in favor: the american beverage institute. The industry group says dadss will \" stop many responsible social drinkers who have a glass of wine with dinner from starting their cars \" — and is pretty skeptical of claims that the system will be voluntary.",

Dealing with those spiders and other bugs is the smallest contributor: that job is worth $ 57 a year. The 2013 total represents a hefty 15 % rise over last year, thanks to wage bumps among occupations like plumbers. Mom's 2013 market value is $ 59,862.

The appeals court judges in porto called adultery a \" serious attack \" on a man's \" honor and dignity, \" citing a 1886 law that calls for only a symbolic penalty when a man kills a cheating wife. The oct. 11 ruling says the bible calls for an \" adulteress \" to be \" punished with death, \" per reuters. The panel writes that \" society has always strongly condemned adultery by a woman and therefore sees the violence by a betrayed, humiliated man with some understanding. \" the man was ordered to pay a fine of $ 2,000, per the ap. Prosecutors had requested 3.5 years in prison. The woman's scorned lover, who was also fined, participated in the 2015 attack in which the woman was kidnapped and beaten, per npr. The victim, who was left with cuts and bruises, could appeal the ruling, which women's rights activists called \" revolting, \" per reuters. The women's union for alternative and response slammed the decision as \" victim blaming, \" saying it legitimizes violence against women. The bible has no place in a courtroom, the group added in a statement, calling for protests on friday. A council that oversees the judicial system said courts are independent and it could not intervene even in cases in which judges make \" archaic, inappropriate, or unfortunate \" comments, per the ap.

At one point, a team in tactical gear stormed into a building, and more than a dozen police cars massed near boelter hall. People emerged from buildings with their hands raised or behind their heads. Police told people to stay away from the campus in a bustling part of the city. Many students posted to social media, many to let friends and family know they were safe.

At a mathematical sciences building near boelter hall, swat officers with guns drawn cleared occupants who emerged one by one. One man walked out with his hands up and was told to get on his knees.

The move comes as tensions with pakistan are at a dangerous high. The cia has apparently concluded that pakistan is either unable or unwilling to take out al-qaeda safe havens. The agency drone strikes are technically covert operations, the journal explains, because the us military is forbidden to conduct operations in pakistan. The distinction allows pakistan's government to officially deny any knowledge. Part of the recent increase is because of reports of a major terror plot being hatched in the country.",

At the capitol rally, the crowd booed when politicians like john boehner were mentioned and cheered when trump told them that he had never seen a deal \" so incompetently negotiated as our deal with iran \" and that we \" are led by very, very, stupid people, \" the ap reports. The wall street journal reports that the rally also featured a rare appearance from jim gilmore, who is running for president but hasn't cracked the top 15 in the polls.

The launch follows a successful may test flight to the iss. Spacex's dragon capsule took off from cape canaveral at 8: 35pm, propelled by the company's falcon 9 rocket, space.com reports. It was a big success for the company, despite a minor hitch: one falcon 9 engine reportedly shut down as it climbed, but the eight other engines picked up the slack. The unmanned capsule is due to arrive at the iss on wednesday as part of a $ 1.6 billion partnership with nasa consisting of 12 missions, which are set to bring some 20 metric tons of materials to the station. This particular flight is carrying more than 1,000 pounds of supplies, including a treat for astronauts at the iss: vanilla ice cream mixed with chocolate sauce. The flight will remain at the station for almost three weeks before returning with 2,000 pounds of stuff, including experiment results and hardware that needs fixing. Prior to this flight, the iss was being supplied by russian, japanese, and european spacecraft, which could only transport items one way; they were designed to burn up upon re-entry. By 2015, spacex hopes to take astronauts to space.",

In case you missed it, last month a band called vulfpeck created a silent album called \" sleepify, \" and urged fans to play it on repeat all night while they slept. The band only has about a thousand fans, but they were able to not-listen hard enough to earn the band $ 20,000 in royalties, gawker reports. Spotify ended the party a few weeks ago — which vulfpeck revealed in a gimmick three-track ep. Spotify told him that \" while they enjoy sleepify and thought it was funny and clever, it violated their terms of content, \" frontman jack stratton said in a spoken track called \" #hurt. \" the next track is 30 seconds of silence. Stratton tells vice that spotify hasn't paid up yet, but he assumes it will, and he's not worried about any repercussions from the stunt. \" you have to be practicing yoga and eating grass-fed butter to face the coldness of the free market, \" he says.",

Friday's memorial service in october 2012 drew a large and reverent audience: scholars of the humanities and sciences, national political figures, and university staff members such as willingham, who'd spent the previous decade tutoring athletes and other undergraduates in need of remedial reading help. The tribute to friday, president of the state university system from 1956 to 1986, reflected the accomplishments and contradictions of the institution he embodied. Slaves helped build unc, the nation's first public university, which opened in 1795. The original memorial hall, dedicated in 1885, honored students and faculty who'd died defending the confederacy.

Unless lawmakers can hammer out a deal this morning, a vote this morning on the nomination of richard cordray to head the consumer financial protection bureau could trigger harry reid's threat to use the \" nuclear option \" to reform the filibuster via a party-line vote, reports the washington post. Reid says the gop can avoid the showdown by allowing simple-majority confirmations on presidential nominees for executive branch positions, including cordray, that it has been blocking. Reid says banning filibusters against executive branch nominations would be a narrow change, but it will still be the biggest change in how the senate operates in 40 years and could pave the way for the total death of the filibuster, the new york times notes. Reid appears to have president obama's support for the threatened change: white house spokesman jay carney told reporters last night that the senate \" needs to confirm this president's nominees in a timely and efficient manner, \" and that will be true \" for the next president, and the next president after that. This has become ridiculous. \" asked whether obama fears that the change could make the senate more dysfunctional, carney said, \" it boggles the mind how they would achieve that, \" the ap reports.",

Such is the assertion of the lost gospel, a new book that was six years in the making, per abc news. Professor barrie wilson and writer simcha jacobovici based their claim on a 1,500-year-old aramaic manuscript, the \" ecclesiastical history of zacharias rhetor, \" that was added to the british museum's collection ( and sourced from an egyptian monastery ) in 1847; it was moved to the british library two decades ago. A description of the book on amazon outlines even more explosive claims, among them, \" a previously unknown plot on jesus ' life, 13 years prior to the crucifixion; [ and ] an assassination attempt against mary magdalene and their children. \" among the many reasons to be skeptical: the authors say they reached their findings by \" decoding \" the manuscript; in their view, figures named joseph and aseneth are stand-ins for jesus and mary magdalene, reports the washington post, which notes that jacobovici released a 2002 documentary on an ossuary purported to hold the bones of jesus ' brother, james — a relic the discovery channel later dubbed one of the 10 greatest scientific hoaxes ever. Further, the authors paint themselves as having \" uncovered \" the manuscript, though at the huffington post, greg carey writes that's more than a bit of a stretch: \" online databases reveal over three hundred scholarly books and articles devoted to this text, not counting book reviews. \" the independent notes that the authors are holding a wednesday press conference at the library.

One alleged conversation involved white house counsel don mcgahn; trump told an aide that mcgahn should deny a january times article that said trump had asked mcgahn to fire mueller. Mcgahn didn't deny it, and he ultimately reminded trump that he had, in fact, asked mcgahn to contact rod rosenstein and make sure mueller was dismissed. The other alleged conversation involved reince priebus; the sources say trump asked his former chief of staff in december how his interview with mueller's investigators went and whether they were \" nice. \" sources tell fox news the latter conversation included \" nothing \" of substance and trump just felt bad priebus had been questioned for hours. Fox's sources also deny trump ever \" ordered \" mcgahn to see mueller fired; they say trump simply directed mcgahn to see what could be done about mueller. But sources confirm the times'version of events to politico. Legal experts tell the times the conversations probably don't meet the definition of witness tampering, but the paper notes trump appears to be ignoring advice from his lawyers to avoid appearing to interfere with mueller's investigation into russia's tampering with the 2016 us election. Witnesses and lawyers who learned of the two conversations told mueller, who's also investigating whether trump attempted to obstruct the investigation, about them. Legal experts say mueller will likely now direct an increased focus toward trump's interactions with witnesses in the probe, and that the conversations with mcgahn and priebus could be evidence in a possible obstruction case.",

Ghomeshi claims the sex was consensual, and no woman has said she told him to stop.

Syriza leader alexis tsipras - who was sworn in as prime minister on monday - is expected to unveil his new cabinet later on tuesday. \" i haven't met an economist in their heart of hearts that will tell you that greece will pay back all of that debt. It can't be done, \" mr tsakalotos said.

John maynard keynes with a hint of karl marx is how one analyst described the self-proclaimed \"accidental economist \" who is now to become greece's finance minister and a key negotiator with its international creditors. With a typically literary flourish, he celebrated his party's victory by paraphrasing welsh poet dylan thomas. \"greek democracy today chose to stop going gently into the night. Greek democracy resolved to rage against the dying of the light, \" the greek-australian wrote on his blog. One of the first two ministers to be confirmed by prime minister alexis tsipras, varoufakis studied at essex university and has taught in australia, greece and the united states. In pre-election interviews he vowed to destroy greek oligarchs, end what he called the humanitarian crisis in greece and renegotiate the country's debt mountain. \"we are going to destroy the basis upon which they have built for decade after decade a system, a network that viciously sucks the energy and the economic power from everybody else in society, \" he told britain's channel 4 television.

The state late last year asked its supreme court for permission to execute at least a dozen convicts — its biggest request ever — and intends to use a law passed last year that would keep the details under wraps, raw story reports. Among those details that wouldn't be revealed: the executioner, the drug cocktail used, or where it was sourced from. The tennessean reports 10 have execution dates set, between april 2014 and november 2015. Why seek so many executions now ( since 1960, tennessee has seen only six executions )? likely because the cases backed up over death-penalty legal challenges and drug shortages, analysts say. \" i think what happened is, is the pipe has been cleared, \" said a pro-death penalty advocate. Specifically, the state halted executions when it ran out of sodium thiopental in 2011, and has now acquired a contentious lethal-injection drug called pentobarbital. As for the secrecy law, other states ( like missouri, georgia, and oklahoma ) have approved similar legislation to shield the details about their lethal-injection drugs. Some tennessee inmate attorneys are suing to stop the executions over doubts about the drug, and the times free press notes that similar challenges have delayed tennessee executions before, sometimes for years.",

        "summary": "The last time scientists visited the remote french island of île aux cochons in the indian ocean, they found more than 2 million king penguins, including 500,000 breeding pairs. That was 1982, and it gave the island the distinction of being the largest such colony in the world. But in the first comprehensive new count since then, researchers report in antarctic science that only about 200,000 king penguins now inhabit the island. Of those, about 60,000 were in pairs, reports the bbc. The new numbers are based on aerial photos taken in 2015 and 2017 of the island, which sits between antarctica and the tip of africa, per the guardian. For now, researchers have no clear answer on what explains the population plunge, though followup field studies could shed light. \"it is completely unexpected, and particularly significant since this colony represented nearly one third of the king penguins in the world, \" says lead author henri weimerskirch of the centre for biological studies in chize, france. One theory revolves around the weather: a particularly strong el niño in the late 1990s warmed regional waters and might have pushed penguin prey such as fish and squid out of foraging range long enough to have devastating consequences on such a dense population, according to a news release. Those effects could have been amplified against the larger backdrop of climate change in general, notes the guardian. Other theories include diseases such as avian cholera, or the arrival of invasive species such as rats or mice. ( on the flip side, researchers found a previously unknown colony of a different type of penguin. )",

        "summary": "Erika murray may or may not be the mother, but an investigation into the squalid conditions of her vermin-infested home in massachusetts last week has unearthed a tragic discovery: the bodies of three deceased infants. That discovery comes on the heels of one made in late august, when state welfare agents removed four living children ( ages 13, 10, 3, and 6 months ) from her and her boyfriend ray rivera's 1,150-square-foot home — and her boyfriend claims to have only known about the existence of the older two, reports cnn. Murray, 31, is currently being held in a prison treatment unit for inmates at risk of hurting themselves, reports the ap, while her attorney says she was a \" prisoner of her own fear \" and that it's \" kind of obvious that many things going on in her head were not real. \" though murray has yet to be charged with homicide, she is facing a raft of charges that range from concealing an out-of-wedlock fetal death to two counts of allowing substantial injury to a child; she has pleaded not guilty to all. The boston globe reports that the deceased babies ' genders, ages, and causes of death have yet to be determined. The house, which is on the same street as the police and fire headquarters, was initially visited in late august when a neighbor saw the crying 6-month-old covered in feces. The town of blackstone has since spent more than $ 20,000 in cleanup efforts, digging through piles of dirty diapers, insect infestations, and the mystery of just how many people, dead or alive, were in the house. ( in other grim news, a hoarder in arizona managed to conceal her mother's dead body for four years. )",

        "summary": "While attempting to leave a hollywood club early this morning, lindsay lohan allegedly struck the manager of a nearby lounge with her porsche … and then left the scene. Lilo found herself blocked into a parking lot by paparazzi and other onlookers when her car reportedly lightly tapped the hookah lounge manager, but she was able to \" peel out \" and leave after the mini-collision, tmz reports. Police — perhaps called by lilo herself to help deal with the paparazzi — investigated at the scene, and it initially appeared no one had been hurt, which was good news for lohan ( who, remember, is on probation ). However, this morning sources told tmz that the manager went to the emergency room and wants to press charges and hire a lawyer. Right now police consider the case closed, but if he files a report, they say they will open a hit-and-run investigation. Interestingly, sources note that the 26-year-old manager — whose knee and car were allegedly grazed as lohan attempted a three-point turn — didn't know who she was at first, and told the nearby paparazzi he was ok ( and even started smoking a hookah ). Police say they informed him of who allegedly hit him, but he said he didn't recognize her name. Shortly after that, he apparently ( and perhaps conveniently ) started complaining of an injury. Tmz also notes that lohan switched seats with her passenger shortly after the accident. ( lohan, of course, insists through a friend that she didn't hit anyone. )",

        "summary": "Ibuprofen for your splitting headache, or venom from the \" killer of killers \"? scientists say that poison from one of the rarest, most \" beautiful \" snakes in the world — a creature that devours king cobras for breakfast and boasts \" freaky \" long venom glands that run a quarter of its body length — could potentially provide effective pain relief for humans down the road, the bbc reports. A study by university of queensland scientists in the journal toxins points to the long-glanded blue coral snake ( or \" the snake with the scorpion's sting, \" as it's referred to ) as the source of a fast-acting venom that immediately short-circuits its prey's nerves via a \" massive shock to the system, \" study co-author bryan fry tells phys.org. While this resembles the devastating blow dealt by such animals as the cone snail, it appears to be the first time a snake has been identified as having this instantly intense capability. \" most snakes have a slow-acting venom that works like a powerful sedative — you get sleepy, slow, before you die, \" fry says, per the bbc. Instead, the calliophis bivirgatus ' poison, while not instantly deadly, basically freezes its victim into a state of paralysis due to all of the nerves firing simultaneously. And this odd snake — on a \" weird \" scale of 1 to 10, fry says it ranks an 11, per the sydney morning herald — could soon brag of another first: its venom affects nerve sodium channels in a way that could be beneficial to easing pain in humans. \" from a drug development perspective, this is interesting, as this animal is evolutionarily speaking closer to us than a scorpion, \" fry says. \" which means it might be more amenable to us \" and possibly provide the material needed for the world's next \" wonder drug. \" ( rattlesnakes are being used to study wildfires. )",

Though the production of polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ), which contaminate the environment and are believed to cause cancer, was outlawed, pcb-11 is allowed to remain in yellow pigment because it counts as an unintentional byproduct of manufacturing, scientific american finds. The researchers say it is present in \" worrisome \" levels — all 16 clothing items they tested, most children's clothes bought at us walmarts, contained it — and people are in almost constant contact with the pigments, which are mainly manufactured in asia. Unlike some other pcbs, pcb-11 doesn't accumulate in people or animals, so its health effects have been little studied. But researchers in 2007 found it in air samples taken near chicago schools; in a 2013 study of women from from east chicago, ind., and columbus junction, iowa, researchers identified it in 60 % of their bloodstreams. The paint industry is aware of the contaminants, but \" as of right now, it's an unavoidable byproduct in these pigments, \" says a spokesman for an industry association.

But that was only the start of a cannibalistic ritual taking place in england some 15,000 years ago, scientists say after analyzing a bone with unusual markings found in a cave in somerset, per the bbc. The 15,000-year-old human radial bone has \" unusual zig-zagging incisions \" that don't match 300 other filleting marks on remains in gough's cave, researchers from london's natural history museum write in plos one. Rather, the marks appear to be an \" intentional engraving \" — a form of art — made as \" a purposeful component of the cannibalistic practice, implying a complex ritualistic funerary behavior that has never before been recognized for the paleolithic period. \" evidence of cannibalism in gough's cave is plentiful. In 2011, scientists made the case that three skull cases were actually used as drinking vessels. But the radial bone presents the \" strongest evidence \" yet that \" cannibalism at gough's cave was practiced as a symbolic ritual, \" study author silvia bello tells the bbc. The engraving — similar to engravings on other materials at sites of the same age in france — \" may have been a sort of memory more directly related to the deceased, \" she adds, per seeker. Why honor someone you've just eaten? bello explains the individual, showing no obvious signs of trauma, likely died of natural causes and was afterward eaten by members of the same hunter-gatherer group, in what is known as endocannibalism.

All four quakes were centered in the same location in irving, dallas county, where there have been 20 quakes reported since october 2014, nbc reports. The four quakes — ranging in strength from magnitude 2.7 to 3.6 — were centered near the old texas stadium site, former home of the dallas cowboys, and southern methodist university scientists are trying to determine the cause. The united states geological survey says the quakes — two of which happened within seconds of each other starting at 8: 11pm — were strong enough to break windows and be felt by many people in the area. Researchers say the quakes could be linked to stored stress in old fault lines, although the disposal of wastewater from the energy industry can also trigger small quakes. But \" there are no oil and gas disposal wells in dallas county, \" a seismologist with the texas railroad commission tells the dallas morning news. \" and i see no linkage between oil and gas activity and these recent earthquakes in irving. \"",

        "summary": "\"why is the united states post office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer? should be charging much more! \" president trump tweeted friday. While attacking amazon — and founder jeff bezos — is nothing new for trump, it's unclear why he dragged the us postal service into it, the washington post reports. A citigroup report recently concluded that usps loses about $ 1.46 on every amazon shipment it delivers. Amazon denied that report at the time, stating its \" contracts with the usps are profitable. \" according to usa today, trump's tweet sent amazon stock fractionally lower friday afternoon. Usps, which isn't funded by tax dollars, operates at a loss. Reuters reports it lost $ 2.74 billion in 2017 and has rung up a deficit of more than $ 61 billion since 1971. However, package shipment is one of the few areas — if not the only area — where usps revenue is increasing. Usps'revenue for package shipment was $ 19.5 billion in 2017 — up 44 % since 2014. Earlier this month, the postal regulatory authority gave usps permission to up the price of a first-class stamp by 2 % over the rate of inflation. That should eventually increase shipping costs for amazon and others. But amazon, which also uses fedex and ups to deliver its packages, has reportedly been testing its own delivery service.",

A british conservation officer poring over an aerial photo spotted something suspicious near the edge of one: crenellated lines ( picture the notched top of a castle ). Rob harper's investigation of the site in gosport, hampshire — which had long been cloaked in \" bracken and gorse \" — turned up what the guardian describes as a \" lost first world war landscape, \" a practice battlefield where soldiers would have logged time in the trenches before being shipped to the mainland. Over many acres, harper found \" trenches everywhere \": an overgrown but \" perfectly preserved \" training ground outfitted with frontlines ( both the brits ' and the enemy's ), a \" no man's land \" in between, and communication and supply trenches, reports the bbc. \" it's quite jaw-dropping really, \" harper says of the find, which conservation body english heritage announced yesterday. A wartime archaeology expert says the roughly 20 other mock battlefields that have been uncovered across england pale in comparison to the size and state of this one — of which no written record has yet been found, though historians are now on the hunt for such documentation. A historian explains the site's significance: \" this is where you can see on the ground that it wasn't just about rounding up young men and hurling them at the machine guns: they were being incredibly well trained. \" one archaeologist adds that small slit trenches that appear throughout the complex may have been new soldiers ' first attempts at trench digging.

            "Los angeles — howard stern and his agent are suing sirius xm radio inc. For failing to pay stock awards they say are due for helping it exceed subscriber growth targets on its way to becoming the dominant satellite radio service in the country. The new york-based company, which just signed stern to a second five-year contract, said it was \" surprised and disappointed \" at the suit and said it had lived up to the obligations of their previous deal. In the suit filed tuesday in the supreme court of the state of new york, stern's production company, one twelve inc., and his agent don buchwald said that sirius made an initial bonus stock award after stern started in january 2006 but failed to do so over the subsequent four years. The suit claims that stern helped sirius exceed its subscriber targets by at least 2 million subscribers in each year of the contract, triggering a new stock award each time. It also said stern put sirius in a position to complete its 2008 acquisition of xm satellite radio inc., which had also courted stern years earlier. Sirius had around 230,000 subscribers to xm's 1.3 million at the end of 2003. As of the end of december, the combined company had 20.2 million. Buchwald and stern were told last year by sirius xm's general counsel, richard basch, that later bonus stock awards were not granted because the company did not",

The show ended up being \" revolutionary \" in one sense, she adds, because it \" nakedly and unapologetically \" tried \" to do something other than hand out a bunch of gold statues. \" rock was picked before the \" oscars so white \" controversy erupted, and james poniewozik at the new york times thinks it was a lucky coincidence. Not all the jokes worked, but enough did. \" his performance was an example of something the industry is still trying to learn: that you can achieve both inclusion and entertainment by giving the right person just the right opportunity, \" he writes. \" all too often, a host disappears from the oscars ceremony after their monologue is done, \" writes daniel d ' addario at time. \" this year's ceremony, though, was defined more by its host than by any of the winners. It was better for it. \" and echoing a previous sentiment: \" he was exactly the host the oscars needed in a tenuous moment. \" \" rock's scathing and generally well-crafted monologue at sunday's academy awards recalled the episode of black-ish that aired on the same network just a few days ago, \" writes maureen ryan at variety. \" rock's opening minutes were entertaining, but they made an array of serious points. \" but at the new york daily news, shaun king thinks rock's joke that african-americans in the 1960s \" were too busy being raped and lynched \" to care about the oscars was horrible. Rock \" somehow found a way to simultaneously oversimplify what it meant to be black in the civil rights movement while also drastically downplaying the size and scope of the injustice we face today, \" king notes.",

Bucks county prosecutors say morrissey called mcnew, who gave her presents and paid her bills and court fees for various legal issues, her \" sugar daddy. \" but things between the two apparently soured, and he told her to move out, according to lehigh valley live. When mcnew's body was found two days after he was shot in the head, the da's office says morrissey originally blamed her new boyfriend and said she hadn't been at mcnew's home for a week, nj.com reports. But prosecutors say her cellphone auto-connected to mcnew's wifi the night he was killed. Morrissey's lawyer says morrissey, arrested on an unrelated matter, confessed to a cellmate that she went to mcnew's house that night to confront him — another source says mcnew had threatened to go to the fbi about her boyfriend, but it's unclear why — struggled with him over a gun, and accidentally shot him. Her lawyer says it was a \" kill or be killed moment. \" prosecutors say morrissey didn't call for help, instead making it look like a robbery and burying mcnew's phone and laptop in her boyfriend's backyard.

Started on november 1, 2013, the exhibition is closing on november 30, 2013. For the installation's last 7 days, which started this past saturday, november 23rd, ernest partnered with phantom luxury group to place a diamond a day in the maze part of the exhibition with the exception of thanksgiving day. Serving as a real-life scavenger hunt, whoever finds the diamond will be able to keep it. \" i want to give people hope \" says jamison. The 7 diamonds totaling $ 77,777 will change 7 people's lives. Examiner.com had the opportunity to catch up with the brooklyn native and get what inspired him, his thanksgiving plans, and what this exhibition means to him, read the full interview below: examiner: how are you? jamison ernest: \" young, alive and healthy, that's a great start to anything. \" examiner: can you explain the reasoning behind the $ 77,777.00 in diamonds? jamison ernest: \" great foundations are built with the number 7. \" examiner: how vivid is the car accident that you witnessed 15 years ago, and how has it inspired you to create this piece? jamison ernest: \" it feels",

        "summary": "June's issue of the atlantic packages jeffrey e. Stern's 9,000-word piece on clayton lockett's botched april 2014 execution in oklahoma as the \" untold story \" of what happened. And while many of the details have surfaced elsewhere — a september report by the oklahoma office of public safety, for instance, noted the 38-year-old had been hoarding the anti-anxiety med hydroxyzine, and mother jones framed it as evidence lockett was trying to take his own life — stern gets deeper inside that cell and this story. From stern's lead: \" before a team of correctional officers came to get him at 5: 06am, he fashioned a noose out of his sheets. He pulled the blade out of a safety razor and made half-inch-long cuts on his arms. He swallowed a handful of pills that he'd been hoarding. \" from there, stern presents an incredibly comprehensive and nuanced portrait of what preceded lockett's death — and of that death itself. He paints a picture of stephanie neiman, the bold 19-year-old lockett shot before she was buried alive; charts the journey america's prisons have taken in the last two decades to secure lethal injection drugs; introduces the surprising people often responsible for choosing the drugs used; weaves in katie fretland, the young reporter who had been digging into oklahoma's death penalty practices since 2012 and was present for lockett's execution; shares details from lockett's dark childhood; and relays in stomach-turning detail the dozen-plus attempts to get an iv into lockett. And then there's what came next: \" he started writhing as if trying to free himself, to get up off the gurney. … another witness saw lockett open his eyes and look right at the doctor, like something out of a horror movie. … from the viewing area, katie fretland could see the doctor's face for the first time, and his expression was clear: oh, f ---. \" read stern's piece in full here.",

What would have been gandhi's 147th birthday sunday put one of the most revered figures of the 20th century on trial as about 75 protesters from throughout northern and central california accused gandhi of racism, genocide and rape – everything from the perpetuation of india's caste system to the creation of the islamic state. Using megaphones to lead chants of \"gandhi, gandhi you can't hide, you committed genocide \" and \"racist gandhi, \" the protesters nearly drowned out a panel of speakers while about 400 people in support of the statue – the majority of them indian americans – tried to listen. The protesters – many of them sikhs with grievances against the indian government – had turned the aug. 30 davis city council meeting into a three-hour tribunal. That night, dozens of speakers hotly debated whether gandhi was a saint or sinner, beacon of justice or bigot, an \"apostle of peace \" or pedophile.

Esmerelda hernandez prematurely gave birth to jose, a stillborn boy, in april 2013 at st. Paul's regions hospital, the twin cities pioneer press reports. As she and her family mourned jose in her room, regions staff asked if they could cremate the baby's body, per the suit; the family agreed. But nearly two weeks later, someone anonymously placed a call to cops that staff at crothall laundry services, where the hospital's linens were sent for cleaning, had come across the baby, still in his diaper and id bracelet, in dirty laundry. The baby's body \" flew out and landed on a metal grate, \" and workers proceeded to \" gawk at baby jose, took photos of him, and sent pictures of him into cyberspace, \" per the complaint, which is asking for \" far in excess of $ 50,000 \" each for hernandez and her nine co-plaintiffs. Two hospital workers were allegedly sent to get the body, and neither cops nor the hernandezes were called, the suit notes; the hernandezes reached out to the hospital after they heard media reports. Per legal documents, the laundry facility manager noted it wasn't unusual to find medical waste — including \" tissue, blood, and on occasion, an appendage \" — among the hospital's linens. Regions reps say a hospital worker had spotted the baby's body wrapped in linens ( not in a body bag, a process minnesota public radio has called into question ) on a shelf in the hospital's morgue and mistaken it for a pile of dirty laundry, reports the washington post. The body of a second baby was believed to have been sent to crothall around the same time as jose; that body was never found. A hospital rep reiterates its apologies and says it's \" always open to a reasonable resolution, \" per courthouse news.",

Coli bacterium, which led to hemolytic uremic syndrome ( hus ) after shiga toxins targeted tiny blood vessels and hampered their bodies ' ability to transfer oxygen in red blood cells. Kallan, who would have turned 4 next month, soon died of multi-organ system failure, and her brother remains in critical condition, struggling to survive. Most kids exposed to this strain of e. Coli get better, but 10 % to 15 % don't, even after seeking medical care, reports cbs minnesota. \" it's very serious — potentially fatal, \" a kidney specialist says. \" it can happen anywhere. It happens in the heart, happens in the brain, the gut, the liver, and the pancreas. \" authorities are still investigating to determine where the siblings contracted the bacterium, which lives on cow feces and tends to be transmitted through food or in contaminated pools or lakes. In an \" abundance of precaution, \" the petting zoo they visited took the animals off display. The family reports on caringbridge that kade has had a blood transfusion and is on dialysis. Their gofundme page to help with medical expenses has raised more than $ 63,000 as of this writing. ( in spite of her e. Coli illness, this woman wants more chipotle. )",

            "Plenty of experts have decided that the answer to the euro-zone's problems is to insist that the european central bank buys up the bonds of countries like italy in ever increasing quantities, effectively printing money to ease credit conditions and lower borrowing costs. However, it's arguable that by refusing to do so, the ecb is applying much needed pressure on the area's politicians to take the fiscal action that's absolutely essential if this crisis is to be solved. For the politicians, who can't even agree on how to boost the efsf bailout fund — that ought to be riding to the rescue — never mind on tighter tax-and-spend policies, bullying the ecb into taking the efsf's place is an easy option. But unless you take the view that it's already too late and that the politicians will never have the strength to do the right thing, the ecb may well be right to resist the pressure on it. The argument for ecb action goes like this, from valentin marinov, a strategist at citigroup: \"buying more time for the embattled italian politicians … is becoming a priority now with more ( aggressive ) bond purchases by the ecb likely to remain the only credible way to do that, \" he says. \"we suspect that many investors are seeing the latest market focus",
