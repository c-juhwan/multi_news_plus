        "summary": "The girl is 10 years old, 22 weeks pregnant with the child of the stepfather who raped and impregnated her even after he was reported to social services. And she's the subject of a fierce debate among adults over the moral, legal, physical, and psychological implications of whether she should carry the child to term or be allowed an abortion. The girl lives in paraguay, reports the guardian, which bans abortion except in the case of a threat to the mother's health, and the government has thus far denied the girl's mother's request to grant an abortion. \" right now, there is no reason to interrupt the pregnancy, \" says a public health rep, adding that \" given the stage of the pregnancy, it's even more dangerous for the girl \" to abort. The facts of the case: the child's mother reported the stepfather's sexual abuse in january 2014, and authorities took no action. They did, however, arrest the mother when she brought the girl to the hospital with a swollen belly late last month and the pregnancy was discovered, reports cnn. The stepfather is on the run. \" that girl is now alone, \" says a feminist activist, and \" the paraguayan state has a clear responsibility for that. \" amnesty international is among other groups that have jumped in, claiming that the girl's age alone should trigger an exception. \" the physical and psychological impact of forcing this young girl to continue with an unwanted pregnancy is tantamount to torture, \" says a rep. But, counters the government rep, \" she has no complications at all. If any complication appears, we will proceed based on that. \" ( an 11-year-old girl in chile two years ago caused a similar debate. )",

        "summary": "There have been many reports lately about so-called \" dry drowning, \" \" delayed drowning, \" or \" secondary drowning, \" like when a boy in texas died several days after swimming last month. But many experts, including emergency room doctors, the world health organization, the red cross, and the cdc, say there's a big problem with these terms, which are confusing and \" unduly alarming \" parents, reports live science. Drowning is defined as breathing problems following being submerged or immersed in a liquid, and it doesn't necessarily kill a person. If it does, it can take minutes, hours, or even days, though lengthy delays are very rare. So-called dry drowning is, in short, just straight-up drowning. As one doctor describes it on her blog, drowning happens when someone aspirates, which is the technical term for something passing the trachea into the lungs. Aspirating can kill someone quickly, or lead to more drawn-out breathing trouble and even pneumonia or death days after the event. It's very different from swallowing something into the digestive tract. That may make a swimmer cough or even throw up, but aspirating involves coughing, gasping, sputtering, and may even require cpr. If coughing, wheezing, or pain persists, or a person seems unusually tired, it's time to get to the er. The bottom line? watching children while they are swimming is key to knowing whether they actually aspirate. If they don't, they're not going to fatally drown next week. \" there are no cases of completely normal, asymptomatic patients who suddenly die because they went swimming a few days ago, \" said the president of the american college of emergency physicians in a statement this week.

The drill is scheduled to begin next thursday, involve up to 13,000 troops, and last a week, but \" some 2,000 transporters with soldiers and equipment have approached and are approaching our borders, \" says poroshenko. \" there is no guarantee that after the end of these maneuvers all this will return to russia. \" more on the wariness in the region, which has been building for weeks: russia has said 5,500 russian and 7,200 belarusian troops will participate in the maneuvers, along with aircraft, tanks, and navy ships. But the ap reports officials in other countries think that number is bs. Estonian defense minister juri luik in july predicted as many as 100,000 troops would be present; poland's deputy defense minister michal dworczyk also expressed skepticism about the count. The bbc boils poroshenko's fears down to these comments: that the maneuvers might be \" a smokescreen to create new russian army assault groups to invade ukrainian territory.... There is more and more proof of its preparations for an offensive war on a continental scale. \" in august, the former president of georgia speculated that belarus could be a target, per an earlier newsweek article. His key line: \" what we are seeing in belarus, i think that russia is planning to take and annex belarus. \" russia has promised its drill isn't a cover for any such nefarious plot, but the financial times notes there's precedent at play: russia's 2008 invasion of georgia came as its war games ended in the caucasus, and in 2014, troops deployed as part of a \" snap exercise \" kicked off the annexation of crimea. But the ft thinks russia is at most trying to intimidate its neighbors. \" putin might, in theory, benefit from a'small, victorious war'six months before he must face elections. In practice, a conflict in north-east europe is unlikely to be small, or containable, and would carry extraordinary risk. \"",

The militants \" are beginning to torture and kill ukrainian patriots, \" said oleksandr turchynov. \" they are impudently rejecting the calls of not only our country but of all the world's society when they demonstratively mock the decisions taken in geneva. \" one of the victims, he said, was a member of the city council in slovyansk and a member of his own party. More: the ukrainian government appears emboldened by joe biden's visit yesterday, reuters notes. \" we have obtained the support of the united states, that they will not leave us alone with an aggressor, \" the deputy prime minister said when announcing the \" liquidation of illegal armed groups \" in the east. \" we hope that in the event of russian aggression, this help will be more substantive. \" slovyansk is emerging as a major flashpoint: ukrainian defense officials say one of their planes was shot at during a flight over the city. The antonov-30 was hit by several bullets but landed safely. The pentagon says it is sending hundreds of extra troops to eastern europe to reassure allies as the ukrainian crisis heats up. Companies with around 150 troops are being sent to poland, latvia, lithuania, and estonia, with the first troops set to arrive today, reports the wall street journal.",

Eighteen mps voted \" present \" on the plan, with another abstaining.

These are the \" last, last \" cuts, prime minister antonis samaras said, noting that \" a lot of what we're voting on today are measures we should have taken a long time ago. \" but two prime ministers before him pledged earlier cuts would be the \" last, \" and the measures remain deeply controversial. Greek central bank workers have resigned in protest; parliamentary staffers warned they might quit as well. Many argue that the cuts won't fix the country's economy. \" telling a whole people that they have to commit collective suicide to save the debt is not a policy, \" says an opposition syriza party mp.

Yesterday, team obama launched a page where you can browse all kinds of information about these donors  their most common first names, for example, or what time of day they were most likely to donate. One piece of data that caught our eye was the number of individual donors from each state. This, we thought, could actually serve as a pretty useful indicator of which state is most enthusiastic about obama's reelection. A poll can tell you how many people say they plan to vote for obama, but words are not as important as deeds, and actually donating money is a clear signal of not just support, but passion and motivation. Now, obviously, the more populous a state, the more likely it is to have a lot of donors. Texas, for example, despite its republican inclinations, boasts 53,224 obama donors, while the liberal bastion of vermont only contains 4,184. It would be foolish to conclude that texas is more likely to go for obama. But if you divide each state's population by its number of obama donors, you find the obama donors per capita, and the picture becomes clearer. So we did that, and then mapped out the results into five tiers, as you can see above. The darkest blue states have the highest rate of obama donations, the lightest blue states have the lowest rate, and the ones in between  well, you get the idea. You can see that the map correlates pretty well with the 2008 electoral college map. Obama won all the states in the darkest shade of blue, and he wasn't even close to winning any of the states in the lightest shade of blue. In general, the darker the blue, the stronger obama performed in the state in 2008. There are a few outliers: alaska and montana, for example, are both in the group with the second-highest obama donations per capita.

        "summary": "Not all was domestic bliss for osama bin laden in abbottabad: the bickering of three wives haunted the final days of the al-qaeda leader, who appeared far older than his age at the time of his death, according to a new report. Bin laden mostly stayed holed up on the top floor of his pakistani compound with his fifth wife — the youngest and his favorite — and another spouse. But his oldest wife moved in to the floor below in the months before bin laden was killed by us navy seals. The jealous woman caused dissension in the wifely ranks, and sources in the extensive bin laden family worried she aimed to betray her husband, according to an account by a pakistani army officer. The fascinating glimpse into bin laden's life is based on interrogations of bin laden family members, and an inspection of the now-destroyed living quarters, reports ap. Bin laden moved to the three-story compound in 2005 with his wives, eight of his 20 children, five of his grandchildren, plus at least 11 others. Bin laden, 54, was frail due to suspected kidney problems and a possible decline in mental health. He was warned of a suspected betrayal by his oldest wife, but bin laden seemed unconcerned, believing that fate would decide his future, according to the pakistani officer, citing family members. But other sources have warned that it's difficult to know exactly what transpired in the bin laden household, and that some of the reports may be twisted by a pakistani political agenda, reports the new york times.",

But for our ancestors, it not only served as a nutritious meal, it cleaned their teeth, according to a new study on plos one. An analysis of hardened bits of plaque from the teeth of ancient skeletons in sudan reveals that those who ate the plant had surprisingly few cavities, nature world news reports. Why? it turns out that purple nut sedge naturally fights off the growth of bacteria that causes tooth decay, reports national geographic. One anthropologist calls it a \" very exciting \" find because it's the first reported example of a specific plant fending off tooth decay in ancient populations. The remains reveal that people in sudan were eating nut sedge as far back as 7,000 years ago, before the dawn of agriculture, and the study's lead author finds it significant that they kept eating it even after learning how to cultivate crops, the washington post reports.

The policy is designed, she said, to give patients a higher chance of surviving surgery and recovery. After riley hancey was denied from the u., mark hancey said the family searched for hospitals across the country for nearly two months.

        "summary": "Crocodiles, falcons, shrews: the ancient egyptians are thought to have mummified as many as 70 million animals — and a scan of more than 800 of them reveals that in many cases, what's inside is... Nothing. The work done by radiographers and egyptologists with the manchester museum and the university of manchester is highlighted in a bbc documentary airing tonight, and the bbc frames those findings as a \" scandal. \" the examined mummies were subjected to a ct scanner and x-ray machine in what researchers describe as the biggest such study ever done. Roughly a third did indeed contain well-preserved complete animals; another third contained some remains, though the amount could be as little as one bone, reports the washington post. But the biggest surprise was that about a third contained no remains at all. So what was inside? \" basically, organic material such as mud, sticks, and reeds, that would have been lying around the embalmers ' workshops, and also things like eggshells and feathers, which were associated with the animals, \" study leader dr. Lidija mcknight tells the bbc. Though she explains to the post that archaeologists who actually unwrapped some of these mummies realized decades ago that they weren't always what they seem, the \" sheer volume \" of what occurred is only more recently coming into focus. The use of animal mummies as a \" votive \" offering ( which mcknight likens to lighting a candle in a church today ) was a hugely popular one, but mcknight doesn't think the empty mummies represent a big con perpetrated by ancients looking to turn a profit: \" they were using everything they could find. \" ( meanwhile, the world's oldest mummies are turning to jelly. )",

            "Istanbul — eighty-five syrian soldiers, including one general and at least 14 lower-ranking officers, fled into southern turkey's hatay province on monday, turkish news agencies reported. It was one of the largest mass military defections since the syrian conflict began 16 months ago. A turkish broadcaster, t.r.t. Haber, said the defectors entered the town of reyhanli as part of a group of 293 refugees \"fleeing atrocities in syria. \" it said the defectors were placed in the apaydin refugee camp, where there are already about 2,000 former members of the syrian military who have abandoned allegiance to president bashar al-assad. The civilians in the group were sent to another camp along the shared border with syria. Turkey's anatolia news agency said the 14 lower-ranking officers included a colonel and a lieutenant colonel. The once-close relationship between turkey and syria has badly frayed with mr. Assad's harsh repression of an uprising that began last year in march as a peaceful political protest and has since evolved into an armed insurgency. Turkey's government is now allowing the insurgent free syrian army to operate from bases inside the turkish border and is housing more than 35,000 syrian civilians who have sought refuge from the conflict. The turks also have sent antiaircraft batteries to the border in response to the june 22 downing of a turkish military plane by syrian gunners.",

In the boy's case, doctors tested the device and identified a chemical compound found in nickel in the ipad's outside coating. But many items do contain the metal, including some jewelry and zippers. Nickel allergies are on the rise, says jacob, who points to data showing 25 % of kids who are skin-tested for allergies show a nickel allergy, up from 17 % a decade ago.

        "summary": "Libya suspects the same thing the white house does: that the attack on the us consulate in benghazi was indeed a militant strike timed with the 9/11 anniversary, a libyan official said today. He also confirmed the attack came in two parts: first, on the consulate — using protests against an anti-islam film as cover — then, as security forces evacuated staff to a nearby annex ( supposedly a secret safe house ) a second raid on that house followed, in which two more americans were killed. A us lawmaker gave basically the same account to fox news yesterday. Politico reports that the consulate, where ambassador chris stevens was killed, is just an interim facility and was not protected by marines — who do typically guard embassies, and who are indeed posted at the us embassy in libya's capital, tripoli. As such, the building had fewer security measures than embassies typically have: no bulletproof glass or reinforced doors. In related news: foreign policy reports that cairo senior public affairs officer larry schwartz was responsible for the controversial us statement that romney and others immediately jumped on. He wrote the release — and he oversees the embassy's twitter feed, which continued to defend the statement as criticism came in — and he posted it as-is even though the state department asked for changes. \" the statement was not cleared with anyone in washington, \" an official says, and the white house wasn't happy with it from the get-go. But romney was also roundly criticized for his response to the statement — and daily intel reports that, in an original version of a new york times story posted online last night, a romney campaign adviser even slammed mitt. The presidential contender forgot \" the first rule in a crisis: don't start talking before you understand what's happening, \" the adviser said, but the juicy quote had been pulled by this morning.",

It's not the first time doj has gotten involved, but the magazine obtained a letter from the doj sent to the office of county attorney fred van valkenburg, with some examples: after an adolescent boy sexually assaulted a 5-year-old girl and got only a sentence of community service, the prosecutor handling the case told the girl's mother that \" boys will be boys. \" one woman told the doj that after she reported a sexual assault, a county attorney read her passages from the bible \" in a way that the victim interpreted to mean that the deputy county attorney was judging her negatively for ( having ) made the report. \" a young woman said she declined to report that she'd been gang-raped as a university of montana student because of others ' experiences dealing with the department.

Iron and nickel have been found shooting from the relativistic jets of a black hole several times larger than our sun, but the finding is more surprising than it may seem. It shows the jets are much more powerful than previously believed since they have the power to move heavy atoms; it also identifies the mysterious contents that left scientists stumped as to why the jet's electrons didn't have a negative charge overall. \" we now know that ordinary matter must be providing the positive charge, \" the study's co-author told the los angeles times. The nature study, which looked at radio waves and x-rays emitted from black hole 4u 1630-47, also offers clues to other mysteries surrounding black holes, like what causes the jets in the first place. The study points to a disk of matter surrounding the black hole, as opposed to the black hole's spin, and \" we are planning further observations to try and confirm this, \" the co-author said. Another interesting find? those jets are moving more than a little bit faster than the average hot tub: they travel at 123,000 miles per second, or 66 % of the speed of light. Astronomy notes that while the black hole in question is rather small, the research would apply to larger ones, too.",

            "Nasa/cxc/m. Weiss astronomers have found that high-speed jets from black holes pack a lot of power because they contain heavy atoms. Black hole jets recycle matter and energy into space and can affect when and where a galaxy forms stars. \"jets from supermassive black holes help determine a galaxy's fate — how it evolves, \" said tasso tzioumis from csiro in australia. \"so we want to understand better the impact jets have on their environment. \" astronomers have known for decades that black hole jets contain electrons, which are low-mass particles. But using the european space agency's xmm-newton space telescope and csiro's compact array radio telescope in eastern australia, the research team found the first evidence of heavy atoms — iron and nickel — in the jets from a typical black hole known as 4u1630-47. An iron atom is about 100,000 times more massive than an electron. When a massive particle is moving, it carries more energy than a lighter particle moving at the same speed. \"heavy atoms have been seen in jets from one other system, ss433, but that's a very unusual system, an oddball, whereas this system is quite typical, much more likely to represent black holes in general, \" tzioumis said. While 4u1630-47 is a small black hole, a few times the mass of the sun, the physics",

            "Nasa/cxc/m. Weiss astronomers have found that high-speed jets from black holes pack a lot of power because they contain heavy atoms. Black hole jets recycle matter and energy into space and can affect when and where a galaxy forms stars. \"jets from supermassive black holes help determine a galaxy's fate — how it evolves, \" said tasso tzioumis from csiro in australia. \"so we want to understand better the impact jets have on their environment. \" astronomers have known for decades that black hole jets contain electrons, which are low-mass particles. But using the european space agency's xmm-newton space telescope and csiro's compact array radio telescope in eastern australia, the research team found the first evidence of heavy atoms — iron and nickel — in the jets from a typical black hole known as 4u1630-47. An iron atom is about 100,000 times more massive than an electron. When a massive particle is moving, it carries more energy than a lighter particle moving at the same speed. \"heavy atoms have been seen in jets from one other system, ss433, but that's a very unusual system, an oddball, whereas this system is quite typical, much more likely to represent black holes in general, \" tzioumis said. While 4u1630-47 is a small black hole, a few times the mass of the sun, the physics",

A linguist at the university of kentucky has recorded a short story in proto-indo-european, or pie, a language probably spoken across europe and asia from about 4,500 bce to 2,500 bce. Professor andrew byrd used latin, greek, and sanskrit to deduce what pie might have sounded like, the huffington post reports. It's \" a very educated approximation, \" byrd says. His recording for archaeology magazine tells a story written in 1868 and then translated into pie; in it, sheep and horses discuss their plight as servants of humans. English, swedish, and farsi all come from indo-european languages, byrd tells huffpost. \" farsi and english were 6,500 years ago the same language, \" he notes. \" that's pretty cool, and it kind of gives you a sense of unity. \"",

The question became, what did pie sound like? in 1868, german linguist august schleicher used reconstructed proto-indo-european vocabulary to create a fable in order to hear some approximation of pie. Called \"the sheep and the horses, \" and also known today as schleicher's fable, the short parable tells the story of a shorn sheep who encounters a group of unpleasant horses.

Since there is considerable disagreement among scholars about pie, no single version can be considered definitive.

( associated press ) jackson, ala. ( ap ) — taking the pulpit at a baptist revival at a south alabama church, republican roy moore quoted lengthy bible passages and made only passing reference to the allegations against him of sexual misconduct with teenagers. The former judge found a brief refuge from the political firestorm and the calls from national republicans in elected office for him to drop out of the alabama senate race. Speaking in between hymns and sermons urging people to accept jesus, the embattled senate candidate dismissed the allegations as an effort to derail his rise to the senate and end his political career that included an effort to halt same-sex marriage in the state and install a granite ten commandments monument in the lobby of the state appellate courthouse. \" after",
            "President donald trump is returning from asia to a political maelstrom in the united states — one that could force him to decide whether to push out attorney general jeff sessions in a hail mary attempt to save the alabama senate seat sessions once held. Trump spoke with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell from asia last week, and the senate leader made an urgent plea: please help push moore out of the contest. On monday, as a new female accuser emerged, the republican leader discussed the alabama situation with white house chief of staff john kelly and vice president mike pence. The conversation centered on tax reform, but the senate republican leader also proposed a dramatic idea: that sessions run as a write-in candidate or be appointed to the seat he held for two decades. Story continued below white house officials plan to convene a meeting to talk through their options soon, and trump is widely expected to address the predicament publicly when he returns from abroad",

It seems the 200-plus-page file is made up largely of old news stories. A hacker who calls himself guccifer 2.0 released the document to gawker and to the smoking gun, but if there are any bombshells within, they have yet to surface.

A new study presented at the experimental biology conference over the weekend suggests otherwise — specifically when it comes to diseases like type 2 diabetes. Gizmodo reports on research presented by brian hoffmann and his team, which carried out what a press release says is the largest study yet to follow the body's biochemical changes after consumption of both sugar and artificial sweeteners. For three weeks, scientists fed rats either high doses of fructose and glucose ( two natural sugars ), or the zero-calorie artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame potassium. In the end, all the rats exhibited biochemical changes in their blood that are often seen as precursors to diabetes and obesity. Hoffmann notes sugars and artificial sweeteners appear to act differently on the body, though: excess sugars likely overwhelm the system, while artificial sweeteners seem to change the metabolism of fat and energy. Forbes notes the study hasn't yet been peer-reviewed, no human studies have been done, and the research showed only changes that could lead to diabetes, not that the rats actually developed it. Meanwhile, hoffmann doesn't want to scare anyone off their occasional indulgence. \" if you enjoy your diet soda here and there, than have your diet soda here and there, \" he tells gizmodo. \" it's when people start to chronically consume these … that we should start to be concerned. Because you're starting to introduce these biochemical changes and the body has no time to recover. \" ( stroke and dementia may also result from too much diet soda. )",

But while these claims are routinely debunked as nothing more than junk science, some research — including a new study presented this week at the annual experimental biology conference — is beginning to indicate that sweeteners could actually contribute to health problems like type 2 diabetes. Researchers at the medical college of wisconsin and marquette university used rats vulnerable to developing diabetes for their experiments. For three weeks, different groups were fed high doses of two sugars, glucose and fructose, and two common artificial sweeteners, aspartame and acesulfame potassium. They then studied the rats ' blood using a large-scale technique that tracks minute metabolic changes, known as metabolomics.

A third set of tourists has allegedly been found doing just that at cambodia's angkor temple complex in broad daylight. The cambodia daily reports that two unnamed men around 30 years in age — one italian, one argentine — were allegedly spotted, bare-bottomed, by ta prohm temple guards at 2pm on sunday. The guards say a 19-year-old dutch woman was capturing their posteriors for posterity, and all three were arrested. Adding a slight ironic twist to the unwise shoot: the ta prohm sanctuary holds a giant face representing prajnaparamita, which atlas obscura explains is \" the personification of wisdom. \" it's unclear what will happen next to the tourists: the phnom penh post reports they face deportation, and the prosecutor is said to be weighing whether to summarily try the trio or pass the case to an investigating judge. But resolution doesn't seem to be coming as quickly as it did for two american sisters, who after being caught baring their bottoms in february, were deported the following day. In that case, lindsey adams, 22, and leslie adams, 20, were handed a $ 250 fine and suspended six-month prison sentence and were barred from entering the country for four years. Three french men were also booted from the country in february over a similar photo shoot.

        "summary": "Ever wonder why it doesn't take elephants an hour to pee? well someone did. After studying mammals of all walks of life at zoo atlanta, scientists discovered that, aside from those that weigh 6.5 pounds or less, it takes the rest of us mammals on average 21 seconds to pee, give or take 13 seconds, reports scientific american. Doesn't matter if it's a newborn human, a gorilla, or a giraffe; urination time is extremely consistent, something fairly remarkable when you consider an elephant's bladder is almost 3,600 times bigger than that of a cat. The reason, they surmise, is that even though bigger mammals tend to have bigger bladders, their urethra is wider and also longer, and thus — thanks to gravity — the flow is faster. David hu, the mechanical engineer who filmed the mammals at the zoo, tells the la times he got the idea a few years ago when he was changing his young kids'diapers and thought, \" how could anything be worse right now? \" which was immediately followed by: \" well, maybe if i was changing an elephant's diaper. \" after hours spent at the zoo ( during which they collected urine in cut-up soda bottles during the act in order to measure flow rate ), the researchers also learned that smaller animals, like rats, don't pee in a jet stream but rather in little \" gumballs \" of water dispensed one at a time; they lack the amount of liquid needed to create a real flow. It seems that 6.5 pounds is the tipping point, which is why a grown bear takes as long to pee as sweet little toto. Hu notes that the study could have health implications for humans: if one's urination duration falls outside the norm, it could signal a medical problem. ( speaking of toto, dogs appear to use earth's magnetic field to poop. )",

            "In the time it takes you to listen to this story, an elephant could empty its bladder about three times. And, despite being much smaller, so could an adult cat. And a goat. Also a cow. Because researchers find that all mammals that weigh more than six-and-a-half pounds or so take about the same time to pee: 21 seconds, plus or minus 13 seconds. The researchers videoed various mammals urinating at zoo atlanta. And they found that, once you get above the squirrel-mouse-shrew level, tinkle-time does not scale with body size. Good news for elephants, who could otherwise spend all day going number one. Seems that larger animals have a longer urethra, the conduit that whisks the wee-wee away. That difference in size is big enough that gravity starts to really weigh in. As a result, when jumbo answers nature's call he has a much faster flow than does mittens. Given the urethra's structure, the researchers say that the mammalian urinary system can be \"scaled up by a factor of 3,600 in volume without compromising its function. \" the study is in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. [ patricia j. Yang et al, duration of urination does not change with body size, preprint ] this hydrodynamic finding could help engineers design systems that rapidly drain reservoirs, regardless of size. It also means if mittens and jumbo hit the head together, they can come out at the same time. — karen hopkin [ the above text is a transcript of this podcast. ]",
            "While timing each pee session was easy, measuring the flow rate was hard, because they had to collect the urine. That's no easy task. First off, it's hard to catch an animal in the act. Second, you have to catch all the urine in order to get an accurate measurement of how much liquid is coming out per second. And you have to do it by hand. It was unavoidable: the high-speed camera was occasionally splattered by urine, hu said."

Rosenberg has been in hot water with cannabis fans since calling medical marijuana a \" joke \" earlier this month. He also hedged on whether pot is safer than heroin. On friday, marijuana majority delivered a petition with approximately 100,000 signatures to the dea asking obama to fire rosenberg. \"calling medical marijuana a 'joke ' runs counter to science showing that cannabis has medical value, and it is out of step with the vast majority of americans, \" the marijuana majority's chairman says. But it's not just the public calling for rosenberg's ouster, the hill reports. Seven lawmakers sent a letter to obama on thursday asking for him to be removed. \"he is an example of an inept, misinformed zealot, who has mismanaged america's failed policy of marijuana prohibition, \" rep. Earl blumenauer said on the house floor. Lawmakers call rosenberg a hypocrite for blocking research while claiming the science is out on medical marijuana, according to extract. Vox, meanwhile, notes there is increasing evidence that pot does have medical value. It cites a journal of the american medical association study that finds it can effectively treat chronic pain and thus allow people to skip opioid painkillers. Rosenberg doesn't seem to be buying it, though. \"what really bothers me is the notion that marijuana is also medicinal — because it's not, \" he said in the remarks that caused this controversy. \"we can have an intellectually honest debate about whether we should legalize something that is bad and dangerous, but don't call it medicine — that's a joke. \" ( pot has surpassed tobacco among college students who smoke. )",

One official tells the ap that the two came out shooting; earlier, they had said they wanted to die like martyrs. A second, related siege at a kosher market in paris also is over, though four hostages were reportedly killed, along with a hostage-taker, reports reuters. Police believe the hostages were killed before police attacked the market. Four other hostages suffered serious injuries and 15 were rescued unhurt. In the latter siege, an ally of the kouachi brothers, amedy coulibaly, 32, was identifed as the hostage-taker, and he demanded the kouachi brothers'release. He also is suspected of killing a female police officer in paris yesterday. Authorities are seeking his female partner, hayat boumeddiene, 26, though it remains unclear what role she played in the two crimes. The two raids were launched simultaneously, reports the new york times. The kouachi brothers had been tracked down to the small town of dammartin-en-goele, near charles de gaulle airport.",

She's also accused of attempted first-degree murder for what authorities say was an earlier attempt to kill her husband, lorenzen wright, according to the commercial appeal. On july 19, 2010, lorenzen wright's cellphone called 911 from a field in memphis. The call was cut short by gunshots, and wright's body — shot at least five times — was found in the field nine days later. He was 34 when he died. Memphis police say its gang unit received information about wright's death in may or june of this year. In november, the fbi found what is believed to be the murder weapon in a lake in mississippi. \" we followed the evidence and the evidence led us to billy turner and sherra wright, \" major darren goods says.

        "summary": "John lennon last saw his prized j-160e gibson guitar — the instrument he played when recording \" love me do \" — in december 1963, during a beatles christmas show in a london park. The guitar went missing and stayed that way for about 50 years, when an amateur guitarist realized he'd been playing it for decades, the new york times reports. \" it easily could have been lost, \" says the president of julien's auctions, which plans to auction the guitar in november and rake in an estimated $ 600,000 and $ 800,000. \" there's no mistaking it's the guitar. \" guitarist john mccaw purchased the guitar for a couple of hundred dollars in san diego in the 1970s, and kept it without refinishing or making a single modification — a lucky turn of events, it turns out. Last year, one of his friends recognized the guitar in a beatles memorabilia book written by fab four expert andy babiuk. Such correspondence about possible beatles instruments yields nothing \" 99 % of the time, \" babiuk says, but in this case the serial number and look of mccaw's guitar piqued his interest. He then matched the wood grain to lennon's guitar, and the finding was later authenticated. But the auction house might want to set slightly lower expectations: a jimi hendrix guitar expected to sell for up to $ 1 million went for a paltry $ 320,000 earlier this year on the auction block, guitar player reports. ( george harrison's 1963 guitar sold for nearly half a million bucks earlier this year. )",

        "summary": "Meditation is widely considered a worthwhile practice, particularly as it relieves stress. But it can also cause stress, forcing practitioners to experience fear and even relive traumatic experiences, according to a new study. To put a spotlight on the little-discussed side effects associated with the practice, researchers at brown university interviewed 60 people who'd encountered difficulty in theravada, zen, or tibetan buddhist meditation, per quartz and live science. These meditators described 59 unexpected types of experiences — some good, some not so good — ranging from feelings of unity with others and hypersensitivity to light to cardiac irregularity and hallucinations, while more than 40 % said they had been forced to relive past trauma, per the study in plos one. They also described experiencing insomnia, irritability, panic, fatigue, as well as a distortion in time and space and a loss of emotions, with the effects lasting a few days to more than a decade, reports today — though as the participants were chosen based on the challenges they'd faced, they aren't indicative of the larger meditation community. Hesitant to try meditation anyway? don't be. It's a \" positive and beneficial \" practice overall, a researcher tells quartz. A meditation teacher tells today that some meditators \" may go through some degree of difficulty.

And he hasn't. Politico reports the funding all relates to the state department-based global engagement center, an interagency entity that came into existence last year and is tasked with countering \" disinformation \" from isis and countries like russia and north korea. Legislation signed by former president obama grants the center $ 60 million in funding from the defense department in this fiscal year and another $ 60 million in the next. But tillerson has yet to ask the pentagon to transfer the funds to state; he has until sept. 30 to do so. As for the other roughly $ 20 million, politico reports it's also earmarked for the center and is sitting untouched at state. ( fp's take is slightly different, that a memo has to be sent to congress to get that money. ) politico talks to myriad unnamed sources who read into the situation, with four storylines emerging: that in its five months under tillerson, decision-making at state has moved at a molasses-like pace; that there is wariness about putting funding to use in a way that could further needle moscow; that president trump's desire to cut the department's budget has tillerson tightening the purse strings; and that tillerson has favored the advice of a small group of aides — state department outsiders — when it comes to decision-making.

        "summary": "The world has a new iceberg, and it's believed to be one of the 10 biggest in history. A huge chunk of the larsen c ice shelf in antarctica has finally broken off, reports the bbc. A satellite spotted the break on wednesday, and it probably wasn't difficult: at more than 2,200 square miles, the new iceberg is roughly the size of delaware. It's expected to be named a68, reports the guardian, and its creation isn't a surprise. Scientists have been watching the rift on the ice shelf grow for years, a process that accelerated greatly in recent months. The ice shelf is now about 12 % smaller, and this tweet from the project midas research group provides a map. \" although this is a natural event, and we're not aware of any link to human-induced climate change, this puts the ice shelf in a very vulnerable position, \" says a glaciologist at swansea university in the uk in a blog post from project midas. \" we're going to be watching very carefully for signs that the rest of the shelf is becoming unstable. \" because the iceberg has already been essentially floating on its own for a while, no effect on sea levels is immediately expected. A university of leeds researcher agrees the new iceberg is a \" corker, \" but doesn't sound worried, calling it \" business as usual \" for the antarctic.",

That's when hamilton, who lives across the river, showed up in a boat with his daughter and their dog. \" he just kind of boated right up and was like, ' ok, come through the mud and the slime and come throw your bags in and let's go, ' \" erin says. He reassured their kids and took photos and videos with the family as he ferried them off the north shore. \" now it just confirms him as being a total legend in my book, \" says dad jamas. Meanwhile, evacuations are still ongoing; more than 340 people have been airlifted to safety so far. And the crisis may not be over yet: the ap reports a flash flood warning is in effect starting thursday. Hawaii news now reports that power to wainiha and haena was cut thursday so repairs can be made to a transmission line as crews work to restore full power service. It could be weeks before some roads reopen. ( this weekend was not hamilton's first brush with heroism. )",

On day 4, however, which vox notes will boast a \" make america one again \" theme, the gop hopes to bring the focus squarely back to the guest of honor. Donald trump will take the rnc stage thursday evening to claim a prize most never thought he'd win: the gop nomination for president. The new york times wonders if trump ( whom it calls \" a force that cannot be tamed \" ) will be trump or if he ' ll do what many insider republicans are hoping for: \" cast a wider net \" with a \" populist message \" to sway independent voters away from hillary clinton. The paper also notes that, with the headliner taking the stage for his big moment, more groups of demonstrators are expected to descend upon cleveland's quicken loans arena, perhaps creating a tinderbox of tension that so far has literally burst into flames but not yet an inferno. Introducing trump onstage will be his oldest daughter, ivanka, who the wall street journal says has been given \" one of the most visible — and toughest — jobs \" at the convention. Ivanka is expected to not only lavish praise on her father from a personal pov like her stepmom, brothers, and sister have done, but also to convince women voters that donald is a women's advocate — and that she's \" living proof \" of that. Rnc head reince priebus will also take the stage after what usa today calls \" the longest year of his life, \" as will paypal co-founder and gawker nemesis peter thiel, oklahoma gov. Mary fallin, and liberty university president jerry falwell jr., who's tried to help raise trump's cred among evangelicals. Thiel's is the most anticipated speech among those three for vox, which notes \" this is a really, really poorly organized convention and thiel might say anything. \"",

Stiller helped identify the rare and beautiful species — one of only three known sea dragon species, and the first to be discovered in more than 150 years — from old tissue samples in 2015. In research published friday in marine biodiversity records, stiller and other researchers describe how they followed a hunch to find the ruby sea dragon in the wild near recherche archipelago off the coast of western australia, living at a much greater depth than the other known sea dragons, the cbc reports. The team used a drop-down camera to study the new species in its habitat, and discovered it lacks the leafy appendages other sea dragons are known for, and that — like the seahorses it is related to — it can curl its tail to hold on to things. Researcher greg rouse tells the christian science monitor that the species should be a \" symbol of what remains to be found in the oceans. \" \" the ocean is still a very poorly understood place in terms of biodiversity, and yet the oceans are warming, the oceans are becoming more acid, and we have a risk of losing things before we even discover them, \" says rouse, a professor at the scripps institution of oceanography at the university of california san diego.

Defense sources tell nbc and the new york times that the latest test of the sm-3 block iia interceptor missile, designed to knock out incoming missiles, was a flop. The sources say the sm-3 missed an incoming dummy missile off the hawaiian coast, marking the second failure in three tests for the us-japanese system. An sm-3 block iia failed to hit a dummy missile over the pacific in a joint us-japan test in june, but a test in february was successful. Wednesday's test was the missile system's first-ever flight from the aegis ashore facility at kauai's pacific missile range facility, reports the honolulu star-advertiser. Missile defense agency spokesman mark wright confirmed that there was \" a live-fire missile flight test \" from the hawaii base, though he didn't confirm or deny its failure, the times reports. With tensions from north korea rising — and the country's missile capabilities growing — the sm-3 system is seen as a second line of defense for hawaii, on top of the ground-based interceptor system based in alaska and california, which has a record of 10 intercepts in 18 attempts. Officials declined to comment on possible reasons for the latest failure of the block iia missile, which can be launched from land or ships. ( a worker who sent a false incoming missile alert to hawaii on jan. 13 thought the threat was real. )",
