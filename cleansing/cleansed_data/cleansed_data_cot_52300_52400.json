        "summary": "Big news in the fight against hiv: kaiser permanente, san francisco's biggest private insurer, says that over a 32-month period, not a single one of its clients taking truvada contracted hiv. Truvada is the name of the daily pre-exposure prophylaxis, or prep, pill that the cdc recommended for use in at-risk populations earlier this year. The new study followed 657 san franciscans ( all but four of them gay men ) who asked their doctors for truvada, and found that while condom use did decline — a major fear of prep critics — no one contracted hiv between mid-2012 and february of this year, the new york times reports. More than 40 % of the subjects said they used fewer condoms after starting truvada, the san francisco chronicle reports, and while half of the subjects got syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia within a year of starting prep, the times notes most sexual infections other than hiv can be cured with antibiotics. And rates of those infections were already climbing among gay men before prep came on the market, a doctor notes. This was an observational study of the $ 50-a-month drug; a clinical trial last year actually gave some participants a placebo instead of truvada. That study, however, was stopped early — because it became so obvious that truvada worked that it was unethical to keep some of the subjects on a placebo. This new study \" takes it out of the realm of clinical trials and into the real world, \" one doctor and infectious disease expert says. An aids activist echoes that, noting the study \" fills in a critical gap by showing that prep can prevent infections in a real-world public health program. \" \" this is very reassuring data, \" adds the lead author of the new study. \" it tells us that prep works even in a high-risk population. \" according to abc 7, the study population also included \" injection drug users. \"",

Until now, the standard for time precision in the us has been a cesium-based clock. Some 9.19 billion oscillations of its electromagnetic signal defines a second. But the ytterbium clock oscillates about a quadrillion times per second, allowing observers to \" divide time into finer and finer intervals, \" ludlow notes. Those intervals are extremely regular; indeed, two of the clocks have set a record for stability, science daily reports. Their timing would be perfect for about as long as the universe has existed. Experts must measure the cesium clock across five days for the most precise readings, whereas the ytterbium clock requires just a second to offer the same level of precision. Why would we ever need such a thing? it could mean better gps, for example: because the navigation systems are in space, their time perception isn't quite the same as ours on earth.

        "summary": "In what the uk's civil aviation authority says would be \" a totally unacceptable \" first, a british airways plane landing at heathrow appears to have been hit by a drone on sunday, the bbc reports. The airbus a320 coming into london from geneva had 132 passengers and five crew members aboard, a ba spokesman tells cnn; the incident was reported after the ba pilot touched down. \" our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight, \" the rep says. No arrests have been made ( it's unclear whose drone it may have been ), and the aviation security arm of the metropolitan police is looking into the matter. Police note that flying a drone too close to a plane is illegal, nbc news reports, with punishment including up to five years in prison. Specifically, drones over 15 pounds can't fly higher than 400 feet and aren't permitted to fly \" beyond the direct unaided line of sight \" of its operator or near crowds or buildings. Not that the incident came as a total surprise: the head of the international air transport association had previously noted the \" real and growing threat \" of a drone-plane hit, while a british airline pilots association rep says it was \" only a matter of time. \" a recent study by bard college's center for the study of the drone underscores the danger in us airspace, with 327 \" close encounters \" of drones flying within 500 feet of manned aircraft between december 2013 and september 2015, and at least 28 pilots \" [ maneuvering ] to avoid a collision with a drone. \" frighteningly, aviation experts say they don't really know what would happen if a drone got sucked into a plane's engine, a civil aviation authority rep tells nbc.

( associated press ) sandra layne, of west bloomfield township, was found guilty tuesday of second-degree murder in death of her 17-year-old grandson jonathan hoffman last may 18. Jennifer hoffman and her ex-husband, michael hoffman, said the verdict is \" vindication \" for their son, whose actions and lifestyle were called into question through layne's testimony. She said she bought a gun because she feared the teen and his friends after jonathan hoffman came to live with her during his senior year in high school. Layne fired 10 shots, striking hoffman six times. She claimed she acted in self-defense during a violent argument, but the jury rejected that argument and found her guilty tuesday. She also was convicted of using a gun during a felony and likely faces at least 14 years in prison. \" it's a final vindication for my son, to restore his good name and reputation, because over the course of the last nine months, it's been tarnished in a very cruel manner, \" michael hoffman said.

Cornell researchers drew blood from 4,676 purebred dogs — making up 161 breeds typically created in the last 200 years — and 549 street dogs with older lineages to study chromosomes inherited from the male and female line, reports new scientist. The data showed genetic diversity is highest in central asia, then in surrounding areas like afghanistan, egypt, india, and vietnam, reports popular science. That suggests the most recent common ancestor of \" all the dogs alive today \" came from that region, says lead author adam boyko. \" it mirrors what we see in humans and how they spread out of east africa. \" it's possible some dogs were domesticated elsewhere but diversified in central asia. But \" we found no evidence \" of multiple domestication events, boyko says. \" it looks like there's a single origin, \" though there appears to have been \" a little bit of gene flow between wolves and dogs post-domestication. \" boyko's team suspects higher human population density, better hunting techniques, and climate change pushed gray wolves toward scavenging, which led to domestication. But as similar studies suggest dogs originated in the middle east, east asia, and europe, some scientists are treating the results with caution. One tells the new york times that only a study of ancient and modern dna could provide definitive results. Among difficulties researchers faced: \" we showed up in puerto rico at a fishing village and the dogs turned up their noses at roast beef sandwiches, \" says boyko. \" they were used to eating fish entrails. \" ( genetically, house cats are basically wild animals. )",

According to the new york times, court documents state an unnamed spanish instructor told mol in english: \" no jump, it's important, no jump. \" the appeals court ruled it's clear mol could have heard \" now jump \" due to the instructor's \" incorrect use and pronunciation of english \" as she immediately leaped from the bridge.

The ruling clears the way for the instructor to face criminal charges, including accidental homicide, should prosecutors choose to bring them.

The court found a number of faults with the company beyond ruling the instructor didn't speak english well enough to instruct foreigners in something as dangerous as bungee jumping. It states mol was not attached to a safety line on her way to the ledge, the instructor didn't check for parental consent as mol was a minor, the company didn't have proper permits to jump from the 130-foot-high bridge, and more.

        "summary": "A petsitting company's attempt to sue for $ 1 million over a one-star yelp review got zero stars from a dallas county district court, which firmly rejected the lawsuit. The court also decided that michelle and robert duchouquette, the couple being sued by prestigious pets, \" would be awarded their reasonable attorney fees as well as sanctions to deter future such lawsuits, \" according to public citizen. The duchouquettes posted the bad review after hiring the company to look after their two dogs and betta fish during a trip to texas, and returning to find that the betta fish had apparently been overfed. The company initially sued for nearly $ 7,000, but later filed a suit for the higher amount, claiming the couple had violated a non-disparagement clause in their agreement. The duchouquettes filed an anti-slapp — strategic lawsuit against public participation — motion, which allowed the court to strike down what it viewed as a frivolous lawsuit aimed at quashing the couple's right to free speech, the dallas morning news reports. \" we are so grateful for the attorneys who have supported us through the case, \" the couple said in a statement, per consumerist. \" it took lots of hours and many smart minds spending too much time talking about gordy the betta fish. Thank goodness they did not lose sight of the real issue: the threats posed by non-disparagement clauses to our right to free speech. \" ( this woman was sued after posting a bad review about a law firm. )",

Earnings consist of pretax gross income. Management, agent and attorney fees are not deducted. Online exposure is measured using google blogs.

Covers are an important part of our fame algorithm but their rankings do not show up on celebrity profiles. Twitter followers and facebook fans are measured using twitter and facebook searches.

With $ 52 million in earnings over the last 12 months and a massive amount of fame, lopez lands at no. 1 on our celebrity 100 list for the first time. A few years ago it looked like lopez was done. Her albums, like the all-spanish como ama una mujer, failed to find the broad audience she once enjoyed. Her movies, like el cantante, flopped. Then in 2010 the singer landed a judge's chair on american idol. The job gave her a platform to promote her music and turn her image around. It didn't hurt that she also split from her husband, marc anthony. Suddenly a single mother, lopez lapped up the media attention and scored lucrative endorsement deals with companies like l ' oreal and gillette. She now has a line of clothing at kohl's, a top-selling fragrance and she was able to secure a nice bump — to $ 20 million -- on her idol salary for a second season"

            "A recent colorado tourism office survey of summer travelers shows 48 percent were influenced by legal recreational pot marijuana businesses have long proclaimed that cannabis is drawing visitors to colorado. Now they have proof. A study commissioned by the colorado tourism office and presented to the office's board of directors on wednesday shows legal weed as a growing motivator for trips to colorado — conflicting with the mantra of tourism officials statewide that savvy marketing alone is responsible for record visitation and spending in the past two years. While the state's \" come to life \" ad campaign is certainly successful, surveys in october and november of potential summertime visitors who were exposed to the state's tourism ads revealed that the marijuana laws influenced vacation decisions nearly 49 percent of the time.

Researchers there showed the subjects — 39 men and 13 women — sexual images, and discovered that their brains didn't respond in the same way that, say, a cocaine addict would respond to images of cocaine. \"most people describe high-frequency sexual problems as an 'addiction ' — that's how the public and even many clinicians talk about it, \" one of the researchers tells slate. \" but this data challenges the addiction model and forces us to reconsider how we think and talk about these problems. \" the subjects have higher libidos, or sexual desire, but not necessarily a clinical medical problem. They still need help, but if further studies verify this first one, then the type of help they ' ll get will be affected. All of which might be ok, writes jillian keenan at slate. \" if we turn every single quirk of human sexuality into a'disease, ' after all, then we're all screwed. \" the study is in the journal socioaffective neuroscience &amp; psychology.",

        "summary": "For more than 150 years, researchers have scratched their heads over a civil war mystery — and now a navy engineer says she's solved it. Rachel lance has been diving deep into the 1864 sinking of the confederate submarine hl hunley, which mysteriously went down shortly after sinking the union's uss housatonic sloop with a torpedo, reports a hakai magazine article posted at smithsonian.com. Over three years, lance — a duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself — carried out what gizmodo calls an \" exhaustive … analysis \" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in plos one: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near charleston, sc, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \" there was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why, \" she tells hakai. Her injury biomechanics background finally led her to her shock wave theory. \" when blast waves hit an air space, they slow down like a car hitting a wall, \" she says. \" except in this case, the wall is the surface of the lungs. \" a mini replica of the hunley she dubbed the css tiny and a series of test explosions in a rural pond helped her prove her theory, per cnn. Other researchers remain unconvinced, but hakai says now lance's theory is \" their theory to disprove. \" more on her project here. ( the hunley looks a lot better these days. )",

Hundreds of people were evacuated from l ' enfant plaza station — one of the metro network's busiest — and from a yellow line train that was stuck in a tunnel, the washington post reports. At least two of the injured are in critical condition, and officials say the name of the woman who died will not be released until next of kin have been notified. The ntsb's investigator in charge says the cause appears to have been an \" arcing event \" in which electricity jumped from the system's third rail, reports the new york times. Water in the tunnel may have been a contributing factor, he says. Passengers who were on the stuck train described scenes of panic as the smoke grew thicker before firefighters arrived to help them escape by walking through the tunnel back to the station. \" we couldn't see anything.

        "summary": "Jane austen wrote, \" to be sure, you knew no actual good of me — but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love. \" but had she submitted that line to a modern english teacher, she would have gotten docked for grammar. Instead of \" when they fall in love, \" it should be \" when he falls in love, \" or perhaps the clunkier \" when he or she falls in love, \" right? that has long been the prevailing view, but after a slow and steady creep, that view seems to be disappearing. In fact, this year might be the tipping point for acceptance of the \" singular they. \" quartz, for example, has dubbed singular they its word of the year. And earlier this month, the washington post changed its style guide to accept it, though the guide still encourages reporters to first try to write around it by recasting the sentence as plural, notes poynter. So, \" all students must complete their homework, not each student must complete his or her homework, \" per the guide. But when that kind of rewrite is \" impossible or hopelessly awkward, \" writers should employ the singular they. One big factor behind the shift — not just at the post but in newspapers, online posts, and english classrooms across the country — is the increasing acceptance in society of those who identify as neither male nor female. The singular they solves the problem. ( on a related note, the new york times now permits \" mx. \" as a gender-neutral honorific in place of mr. Or ms., notes quartz. ) grammatical purists may protest, but they are simply wrong, writes english teacher anne curzan at the chronicle for higher education. \" there is nothing grammatically wrong with singular they other than the fact that people say there is something wrong with it, \" she writes, noting the similarity to the outdated rule, still enforced in places, about not splitting infinitives. Adds anna walsh at baltimore's city paper, \" using language that's more accurately inclusive is something that every grammarian should be able to get behind, regardless of what pronouns they personally use. \" ( the internet seems to have invented a preposition. )",

Chapman, who shot lennon in new york city in 1980, is up again for parole in about two years. Chapman's wife recently told the uk mirror that he talked of killing lennon two months before actually doing so.",

The caller asked if gentili knew about the shooting, then announced, \" i ' m the shooter. It's me, \" gentili says. The caller began speaking fluent arabic until gentili asked him to speak in english. \" i will never forget the words he said to me, \" says gentili. He said, \" i did it for isis. I did it for the islamic state. \" the caller refused to tell gentili where he was. When gentili asked if the man had anything more to say, he said no and hung up. Gentili was interviewed by the fbi, which didn't confirm the call came from mateen, but news 13 says the number matched the shooter's phone. The timing also makes sense, per the washington post. The first shots rang out around 2am. Authorities say mateen called 911 around 2: 30am and eventually had two short conversations with a dispatcher. The call to news 13 would have followed. \" i ' m never going to be able to answer the phone again without thinking this is the most serious call i ' ll ever get in my life, \" gentili says.",

Wrapping a baby tightly with blankets restricts the infant's hips from moving freely and raises the risk that they won't develop properly, the uk doctor writes in the archives of disease in childhood. \" in order to allow for healthy hip development, legs should be able to bend up and out at the hips. \" in other words, \" the babies ' legs should not be tightly wrapped in extension and pressed together. \" swaddling is thought to work because it mimics the feel of the womb and thus calms the baby.

Gabrielle giffords is in critical condition after being shot in the head on saturday morning. \" i am very optimistic about her recovery, \" said a doctor at the university medical center in tucson, while acknowledging that the bullet went through her brain. In 2007, michelle tsai explained how one might survive a gunshot to the head. The article is reprinted below. A sheriff's deputy in wisconsin killed his ex-girlfriend and five others at a house party on sunday, then fled. When he was caught hours later, he used his.40-caliber glock pistol to commit suicide — shooting himself twice from under the chin, and then once through the right side of his head. How'd he manage to shoot himself in the head three times? he kept missing the brain. A gunshot to the head isn't always fatal; when the gun is aimed upward from the chin, the recoil can angle the muzzle toward the face. In this case, the bullet travels through the mouth and nose instead of back into the head, where the brain lies. The victim of such a wound would suffer serious injuries to the face; he might also suffocate if the bullet hit part of his nose, or if bits of flesh block the breathing pathway. But the pain isn't necessarily excruciating",

Behbehanian is facing attempted murder charges after authorities say she tried to sneak orange juice... ( associated press ) a california woman faces attempted murder charges after police say she tried to sneak orange juice bottles spiked with a lethal amount of rubbing alcohol inside a starbucks. San jose police arrested ramineh behbehanian, 50, late monday. A customer reported seeing the woman take two bottles of orange juice from her bag and place them in an open-air refrigerated display case at a starbucks in san jose around 3: 45 p.m., sgt. Jason dwyer said tuesday. When the customer told a store manager what he saw, behbehanian fled. A store employee followed behbehanian to the parking lot and jotted down her license plate number as she drove off. Other employees called 911 after noticing the bottles had a toxic smell, dwyer said. Firefighters on the scene tested the contents and determined that the bottles contained a \" lethal quantity \" of isopropyl rubbing alcohol mixed with the juice, dwyer said. No one drank from the bottles,"

        "summary": "Call it the road to nowhere. Scores of wood ants living near an old nuclear weapons bunker in western poland plunge seemingly to death each year — and their descendants follow them — in a bizarre ritual that has amazed scientists. The story begins with hard-working ants that built a colony atop a defunct soviet-era bunker, reports arstechnica. When metal covering a ventilation pipe rusted way, the ants began tumbling down. What sounds like a death sentence ( they can't climb out, there is no food, and it is very cold ) has turned into a survival story because these worker ants keep doing what they always do: building until they die. And when they do? \" a younger generation is on its way, ready to cart off the fallen to a two-million-strong ant cemetery beyond the mound and continue their endless, pointless labor, \" reports inverse. Researchers write in the journal of hymenoptera that a million or so trapped ants have managed to carry on in a virtual cold war nightmare, living in a near-starvation state and total darkness. The colony rests atop a thick cemetery of ant ancestors, indicating this has been going on for quite some time. Zoologists who stumbled upon the odd discovery in templewo while counting bats doubted cannibalism was keeping the insects alive, suggesting bat excrement could be doing the trick. The ants produce no offspring, and so the colony's survival depends on surface ants making the same mistake they did. Wood ants are known to be resilient, though, with one colony surviving on a barren islet for nearly 30 years with only pine trees to munch, the researchers write. ( a historian thinks a $ 500 million treasure hides in an old nazi bunker. )",

Passengers were told that volunteers were needed to give up their seats and that they would receive $ 400, a hotel stay, and a flight the following day. They were told the flight wouldn't take off until four people had given up their seats, but no one volunteered. The airline then doubled the offer to $ 800 and still no one volunteered. A manager then came on board and used a computer to randomly select passengers who would need to leave the flight. A couple was selected and left, and then the man in the video was selected. He explained that he's a doctor and had patients he needed to see monday morning, but was told that security would be called if he didn't exit the flight voluntarily. He said he would be calling his lawyer, and eventually, three security officials came onboard, pulled him from his seat, and dragged him down the aisle and off the plane. Passengers say everyone on the flight was appalled, and children onboard were scared. The man got back on the plane, reportedly \" disoriented \" and with his face bloodied, and ran to the back of the plane. A medical crew came aboard and passengers were asked to return to the gate while the plane was \" tidied up. \" eventually the plane departed two hours late.

        "summary": "It's no secret that most married couples have less sex as the years go by, but those who stick it out tend to see something of a romantic renaissance — it just takes five decades to get there. Researchers looking at 1,656 married adults ranging in age from 57 to 85 have found there is eventually an uptick in the frequency with which couples have sex. What's more, those in first marriages are having more sex than those who have remarried, report researchers from louisiana state university, florida state university, and baylor university in the journal archives of sexual behavior. However frequently or infrequently couples were engaging in sex, marriage order didn't appear to influence emotional satisfaction or physical pleasure. \" growing old as a couple, with the experience and knowledge that come with that, may play a part, \" one researcher said in a baylor university news release. \" the expectation that the relationship will continue may give you more reason to invest in the relationship — including in sexual aspects of [ it ]. \" while the results about the sex lives of one of the fastest growing groups in the us proved \" intriguing, \" particularly because it's a topic that has yet to be studied extensively, the researchers did point out that the 50-year second wind was a slight one, and that relatively few couples make it to 50 years to begin with, thus the sample size was small.

Results showed that individuals in their first marriage had more frequent sex than remarried individuals; marital duration had a curvilinear ( u-shaped ) relationship with frequency of sex; and a linear relationship between marital duration and frequency of sex varied by gender such that men had more frequent sex than women in younger marriages. We speculate that relationship permanency may drive the greater sexual activity in first marriages and sicker men in younger marriages may drive frequency of sex for women in younger marriages.",

Head to the side for a different perspective, and you ' ll see appearances are deceiving. You're looking at what yahoo says locals call the \" montlake spite house, \" an 860-square-foot sliver of a house that's legendary even among tiny houses. The front of the pie-shaped home built in 1925 is just 15 feet wide, while the back comes in at under 5 feet wide, komo reported in 2013, the last time the house was up for sale. Eugene smith, a retired professor at the university of washington who wrote a book on area history, says the wedge-like residence \" was certainly the oddest of all the bungalows \" in the area. \" it was the smallest, most peculiar shape, \" he told komo. And the story behind its supposedly spiteful construction is just as strange as its shape. Yahoo dug up a few origin tales, including that it may have been built by an enraged landowner to spite a neighbor for a lowball offer on the land, per the stranger. It also may have been a revenge move by a long-ago owner, said to have given permission for someone to build a home while he was traveling, as long as there was room left for his own house, which … there wasn't, really, quirksee has reported. But one of the catchiest stories, offered by the oregonian, claims a divorce judge awarded the original, larger home to the husband, and a tiny portion of land to the wife, who then built this minuscule abode to be up in her ex's face. These days there's a law on the books against such a \" malicious erection, \" which involves building a structure to purposely \" spite, injure or annoy \" neighbors by blocking their view, access, or light.

        "summary": "A us air force pilot has died of injuries suffered in an aircraft crash at a training range about 100 miles northwest of nellis air force base in southern nevada, base officials say. A brief statement released friday by nellis officials said the crash that killed lt. Col. Eric schultz occurred during a training flight tuesday evening at the nevada test and training range, the ap reports. The statement didn't provide a hometown or age for schultz ( military.com lists his age as 44 ) or details on the crash, but it said the aircraft was assigned to the air force materiel command. The materiel command's website says it conducts researches and tests weapons systems. The las vegas review-journal reports that the type of aircraft is classified, per a 99th air base wing spokeswoman. The crash, which happened around 6pm tuesday, was the first of two consecutive-day crashes: two fighter jets crashed on wednesday, the base announced. The two pilots in that incident reportedly ejected from their aircraft and were released after being examined by medical staff. The capital gazette reports schultz was a 1991 graduate of annapolis high school in maryland and that his parents, linda and larry schultz, live in annapolis. Schultz joined the air force in 2001 with multiple college degrees under his belt — a youcaring page set up to help his family says there were six, including a phd in aerospace engineering. His parents reportedly traveled to nevada on wednesday to be with his wife, julie, and other family members. Schultz is also survived by five children.",

Dr. Michael davidson died late yesterday, roughly 12 hours after police say 55-year-old stephen pasceri walked into the boston hospital, asked to see davidson, and shot the 44-year-old in an exam room. Pasceri, who was found dead of a gunshot wound believed to be self-inflicted, \" had some issue \" with the treatment of his mother, says the head of the bureau of investigative services. Pasceri's mom, marguerite pasceri, died in mid-november. \" there was a particular reason he targeted this doctor, \" says boston's police commissioner. Pasceri owned the weapon legally, and the dad of four was mostly known in his millbury neighborhood for raising money for his church. \" they are a very good family, \" says a millbury cop, who tells wfxt that \" they were shocked, [ this was ] nothing they anticipated. \" his family issued a statement last night, saying, \" our hearts go out to dr. Davidson, his family, and friends. We are praying for them....

He was hailed as \" a wonderful and inspiring bright light and an outstanding cardiac surgeon \" by the brigham and women's hospital president last night.

Dr. Peter gasser's study involved 12 people who were dying, most of terminal cancer, and suffering from \" deep anxiety, \" the seattle times reports. After undergoing talk therapy, eight of the patients were given a 200-microgram dose of lsd designed to \" produce the full spectrum of a typical lsd experience \" on two occasions; the other four received a 20-microgram \" active placebo \" that wasn't expected to have an impact. They took their 10-hour \" trips \" in gasser's office, and, he says, \" their anxiety went down and stayed down. \" specifically, subjects who received full doses of lsd saw a 20 % improvement in their anxiety symptoms, and for those who were still alive a year later, the improvement had lasted, the new york times reports. Those who took the placebo reported increased anxiety. It doesn't sound like a comforting experience at first: the verge says the purpose of administering the psychedelic drug was to \" facilitate discussions about the patients ' fears of dying, \" and one patient reports that \" the major part was pure distress at all these memories i had successfully forgotten for decades. These painful feelings, regrets, this fear of death. \" but he talked about all that with gasser, something he'd found difficult prior to the trip; the times refers to such distress as \" therapeutically valuable, \" and many subjects had similar experiences.

The palm card, which reads \" you and the law \", is the product of the akron peacemakers, mayor don plusquellic's anti-crime and violence group of akron-area high school students. The card has 15 bullet points, some of which tell the reader to engage politely with officers, i.e. \" don't bad mouth police. \" others which provide more direct advice, such as \" answer all questions pertaining to your identity, \" and \" stay in the driver's seat with both hands in sight on the steering wheel. \" a quote at the top of the flier says \" the easiest way to avoid conflict with law enforcement officials is simply to stay out of trouble. \" peacemakers president and stem high school junior myia culbreath helped present the cards to the media at akron city council chambers wednesday. She said the group was sparked to create the cards after the death of tamir rice. Protestors in cleveland and akron took to the streets in november when a cleveland police officer shot and killed 13-year-old tamir while he was playing with an airsoft-type gun in a park. \" after the unfortunate",

Researchers have presented a small study suggesting for the first time that air pollutants can make their way from a pregnant woman's lungs to her placenta, reports the guardian. Because the placenta allows nutrients and oxygen to flow from the woman's blood stream to her fetus, that means it could similarly allow pollutants into the womb as well, per cnn. \" our evidence suggests that this is indeed possible, \" says norrice liu, a pediatrician who led the research at queen mary university in london. \" we also know that the particles do not need to get into the baby's body to have an adverse effect, because if they have an effect on the placenta, this will have a direct impact on the fetus. \" the study, presented at the european respiratory society international congress in paris, was indeed small, involving just five women. But researchers found \" black sooty \" particles, believed to be carbon, in the placentas of each one, says another of the researchers, lisa miyashita. Further analysis is in the works to confirm, but the results mirror similar ones in animals. Given previous research laying out the potential dangers that air pollution can cause to babies, the scientists say the study should factor into the advice given to pregnant women, even if it's as simple as wearing a mask or avoiding especially busy roads when out and about. The good news: all five of the women gave birth to healthy babies. ( air pollution might be the world's greatest killer. )",

Prosecutors initially didn't seek the death penalty, but the state attorney for albemarle county said today that there is \" compelling evidence from the lab that capital charges are now appropriate. \" denise lunsford didn't offer specifics, but the washington post notes that capital charges can be brought when \" aggravating factors \" such as sexual assault are present. As a result of the capital murder charge, matthew was appointed new attorneys because his previous defense team did not have experience with death-penalty cases. Matthew also is a suspect in a 2005 sexual assault, and his dna has been linked to the body of a young woman found outside charlottesville in 2009.",

The military is investigating how the four soldiers became separated from their unit during the oct.4 attack while seven other american troops were reportedly evacuated. Five nigerien troops were also killed in the attack, though sources tell the guardian that the nigerian forces fled soon after the ambush, leaving the americans to fight alone.

The trapped soldiers also made repeated efforts to convince french warplanes sent from neighbouring mali to engage the enemy, attempting to \"talk in \" the pilots who refused to attack due to poor weather, rough terrain and an inability to differentiate friend from foe, the officers said. Four us soldiers and five nigerien troops died in the incident, which has been the focus of an intense debate in washington over the executive branch's extensive powers to use military force abroad without congressional approval and with little oversight.

But even in the 1890s, they scared kids — and were expensive — and only about 500 of them were built and sold. ( edison reportedly later referred to the failed dolls as \" little monsters. \" ) some still exist, but they've been silent for years. Robin and joan rolfs, owners of two dolls, feared that operating the cranks on their backs could break them, the new york times reports. Their voices came from recordings on wax cylinders, but if a doll's phonograph needle hit the cylinder again today, it could ruin it. The good news, at least for fans of extremely creepy 19th-century recordings, is that we can finally hear them again. That's thanks to the work of a physicist and an engineer, who developed a technology that uses a microscope to study the grooves on the cylinders before they are re-created as computer images and, ultimately, extremely accurate sounds. The cylinders don't have to be touched at all, the times notes. \" we are now hearing sounds from history that i did not expect to hear in my lifetime, \" the curator of the thomas edison national historical park tells the paper. The recordings feature what are supposed to be the voices of little girls reading nursery rhymes. But the curator tells npr that they more likely contain recordings of factory workers mimicking little kids. \" edison himself thought they were unpleasant, \" he notes. Pbs newshour calls them \" nightmare fuel. \" ( but is it enough to knock edison off the list of the 10 most popular americans? )",

At a press conference in cincinnati wednesday, the coroner said the american student's death was caused by complications from brain-damaging oxygen deprivation around six months into his imprisonment in north korea, but the cause of the initial \" insult \" could not be determined, reports reuters. \" we don't know what happened to him, and that's the bottom line, \" she said. Warmbier's family declined an autopsy, but sammarco said a ct scan served as a \" virtual autopsy. \" sammarco, whose report stated there were no signs of torture on warmbier's body, said he had apparently been well cared for during the year or more he was bedridden, the ap reports. Sammarco said she decided to speak to the press after warmbier's parents told national media he had been tortured and \" destroyed, \" the cincinnati enquirer reports. She said a forensic dentist found no damage to the 22-year-old's teeth, which father fred warmbier said looked like they had been rearranged with pliers. \" they're grieving parents. I can't really make comments on their perceptions, \" she said. \" but we here in his office, we depend on science for our conclusions. If we don't have the science, we don't conjecture. \"",

Wbez reports that the crown jewel of the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum's collection, lincoln's stovepipe hat, one of just three thought to still exist, may not have belonged to the 16th president after all. Two reports obtained by the station found insufficient evidence to tie it to lincoln. One was a 2013 report penned by top curators with the smithsonian national museum of american history and chicago history museum who sought to establish its historical provenance: the springfield, ill., museum had maintained that lincoln gave the hat to an illinois farmer in 1858, though a century later a descendant said the hat was given in 1861 during a visit to dc. The report found \" the current documentation is insufficient \" to support either story and suggested the museum \" soften its claims \" or even try to return the hat. It was acquired in 2007 as part of a mammoth $ 25 million purchase of lincoln items by the abraham lincoln presidential library foundation, which runs separately from the museum. The foundation in 2014 asked the fbi to see if dna analysis could establish a tie to lincoln. It relied on dna from lincoln's hair and blood-spattered items from his assassination but found a \" limited quantity of remaining dna data \" in the hat; most of what it recovered \" was consistent with being contemporary dna from an individual who had recently handled the item. \" the story gets thornier: alan lowe — the museum's executive director since july 2016, per the chicago sun-times — only recently learned about the reports, a timeline that he called \" unacceptable \" in a letter to the foundation.

In 1985, there were between 152,000 and 163,000 giraffes, but that number dropped to 97,000 by 2015 — a \" devastating decline \" of nearly 40 % that now moves the animal from the \" least concern \" category into the \" vulnerable \" one on the group's red list. \" while there [ has ] been great concern about elephants and rhinos, giraffes have gone under the radar, \" says dr. Fennessy, co-director of the iucn's giraffe conservation arm. The updated red list, released thursday at a biological diversity conference in cancun, mexico, points to man as the main driver of the declining stats, with poaching, habitat loss, and local unrest all assuming partial blame. A duke university conservation biologist says the iucn is partly to blame, too, for not considering more species threatened. \" there's a strong tendency to think that familiar species [ such as giraffes, chimps, etc. ] must be ok because... We see them in zoos, \" he tells the ap. \" this is dangerous. \" some good news, at least for some long-neckers: of the nine giraffe subspecies, three of them are experiencing increasing populations; one is stable.

However, as the times notes, it remains possible for mueller to subpoena trump in his bid to uncover any links between russia and the trump presidential campaign. According to vox, giuliani's move is part of team trump's increasingly combative stance against the special counsel. Part of that strategy involves a pr campaign to paint the investigation as an unfair assault on trump. Should such a campaign successfully sway public opinion, congressional action against trump would be less likely should mueller's report cast the president in an unflattering — or, possibly, impeachment-worthy — light.

Those imbibing reported differences in all five personality factors: lower levels of conscientiousness, openness to experience, and agreeableness, and higher levels of extraversion and emotional stability. The kicker? observers only noticed the extraversion, per the telegraph, specifically gregariousness, assertiveness, and levels of activity. \" we believe both the participants and raters were both accurate and inaccurate — the raters reliably reported what was visible to them and the participants experienced internal changes that were real to them but imperceptible to observers, \" says winograd, though she adds that you, dear reader, might have to conduct further research: \" we also would love to see these findings replicated outside of the lab — in bars, at parties, and in homes where people actually do their drinking. \" ( winograd previously concluded there are four kinds of drunks. )",

But it's especially the case because \" prometheus \" — starring noomi rapace michael fassbender and charlize theron — shares, as",

It's in the classic tradition of golden age sci-fi, echoing scott's \" alien \" ( 1979 ), but creating a world of its own. I ' m a pushover for material like this; it's a seamless blend of story, special effects and pitch-perfect casting, filmed in sane, effective 3-d that doesn't distract. A scene at the outset shows a world with apparently only one animal being, a pale",

Prometheus ( 20th century fox ), ridley scott's return to visionary science fiction three decades after alien and blade runner, opens big, with an aerial 3-d camera sweeping low over panoramic landscapes so vast and bleak it's as if the location scout actually visited outer space.

Jim parker tells the hollywood reporter, adding that he recorded the entire incident. He says police received a public-nudity complaint; the caller said watts and brian james lucas were having sex in a car near cbs studios. \" [ lucas ] was in the passenger seat with his legs outside, \" according to the caller, an art directors guild office employee, parker says. He claims that at least one person took a picture, and tmz apparently got its hands on that picture — and the gossip site notes that it certainly does look \" like sex. \" parker says watts and lucas were no longer doing whatever it was they had been doing by the time he arrived — watts was on the phone, standing outside the car. \" people having sex in the car, no biggie. No one wants to arrest anybody, \" parker says, but he did ask lucas for watts ' id. \" and he [ lucas ] said, ' oh, i have her passport, ' \" which is when watts started getting upset, parker says, adding, \" quite frankly, i don't need to see her id, but she does have to id herself. \" he says watts walked away, and he didn't want to engage in a physical confrontation, so he requested a female officer to come and bring watts back. That's when the two officers he sent after her brought her back in cuffs, saying, \" she's being difficult. \" as for lucas, he was never cuffed, parker points out. \" i asked her, ' why are you in handcuffs? he's [ lucas ] been here this whole time not in handcuffs.
