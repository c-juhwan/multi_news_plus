        "summary": "It seems skynet is one step closer â€¦ if all the terminator wanted to do is play a 2,500-year-old game. On wednesday, google deepmind announced the creation of an artificial intelligence that successfully beat a professional go player five games in a row, wired reports. According to a study published in nature, it's \" a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away. \" go was once believed to be impossible for a computer to master due to how many moves are possible, quartz reports. According to wired, there's an average of 35 potential moves per turn in chess; with go, it's 250. \"there's more configurations of the board than there are atoms in the universe, \" deepmind's ceo says in a video. Even supercomputers aren't fast enough to analyze every potential outcome with that many moves, according to quartz. So deepmind created an ai â€” alphago â€” that thinks more like a human. It's composed of two neural networks â€” \" computer systems that are modeled after the human brain, \" quartz reports. One is responsible for analyzing its position on the board, the other for choosing a move that \" feels right. \" according to wired, alphago learned 30 million moves by observing the world's best go players, then played itself millions of times to learn new moves that could beat the best. Last october, alphago took on the european go champion and crushed him, quartz reports. In march, it will face off against the world champion. One expert tells wired the ramifications of alphago are huge because it can be applied to \" anything that you can conceive of as a game, \" including \" war or business or [ financial ] trading. \"",

        "summary": "Nearly everyone has been annoyed by ( or indulged in ) articular release of the metacarpophalangeal joint â€” aka, knuckle cracking. Now, per the new york times, one theory has risen over a competing one in the decades-long mystery of what creates the popping sound. In a study in scientific reports, journal researchers from france's ecole polytechnique created a multi-equation mathematical model ( the bbc explains the equations ) that suggests the popping sound is caused by the collapse of a gas bubble in the space between the knuckle bones. A theory from 2015 had said the sound was caused by the bubble forming, not collapsing, when the pressure dropped in the middle of the joint as the finger was pulled. Interestingly, the new study doesn't completely disregard the older study's conclusion, but perhaps complements it. The researchers created their model of a joint with a bubble in it, then compared the predicted acoustic waves generated by the bubble collapsing with the sound of three volunteers cracking their knuckles. The sounds more or less synced up. So how does this jibe with the 2015 study, which showed a continued bulge in the knuckle ( ostensibly the gas bubble ) even after the knuckle had been cracked? the researchers say the sound can be produced by just a partial bubble collapse, leaving the rest of the bubble intact. The next step, the scientists say: to build a model showing the whole process, from bubble formation to collapse. Other tidbits: once a knuckle has been cracked, it won't be able to make that same popping sound again for about 20 minutes. And if you can't crack your knuckles at all? there's too large a space between knuckle bones. ( more on the 2015 study. )",

Based on court documents and inside sources, nbc news reports up to six assistant coaches had witnessed \" inappropriate behavior \" on the part of sandusky starting in 1976 and lasting through the 1990s. Those court documents state paterno, who died in 2012, was told about the incident in 1976. Sandusky is currently in prison for molesting 10 boys he met through his charity starting in 1974. The assistant coaches who allegedly saw something years earlier went on to coach in the nfl and at other colleges. But cnn reports paterno know about sandusky raping a 15-year-old even earlier than 1976. A 60-year-old man tells the network sandusky picked him up when he was hitchhiking in 1971 and sexually assaulted him in a bathroom. That would make him sandusky's oldest victim. He says his foster parents called penn state when they found out what happened, and he told paterno directly. He says paterno told him to stop making things up or he would call the authorities. The victim was never interviewed as part of sandusky's trial because the crime exceeded the statute of limitations. While none of the new claims have been proven in a court of law, penn state's own investigator into the sandusky case believes paterno knew about the abuse earlier that he claimed, according to penn live.",

The spacecraft fire experiment, aka saffire-1, took place tuesday inside an unmanned cygnus cargo vessel after it left the international space station, with what a press release describes as a 16-inch-by-37-inch cotton-fiberglass cloth remotely set ablaze so scientists could then measure how the fire outside of earth's atmosphere affected oxygen use in the craft, how quickly the flame grew, and other factors so that future missions could be made safer. \" our #saffire experiment traveled 1,000 miles in space while burning on #cygnus, \" nasa's glenn research center tweeted tuesday, adding it would start releasing images from the fire, said to be capable of reaching temps as high as 1,500 degrees fahrenheit, this week as they're beamed back to ground controllers. The largest intentional fire sparked before this was the size of an index card â€” providing valuable info, but not enough to truly see the consequences of a real in-space blaze. \" to really understand fire, you've gotta look at a more realistic size, \" a saffire-1 investigator said during a march press call, gizmodo reported then. \" one of the big questions in fire safety... Is how rapidly are conditions in a... Spacecraft going to get bad for inhabitants. \" it was a challenge to even start these experiments, as most engineers were unwilling to risk trashing the spacecraft they had worked so long on, the washington post notes. \" we tried for years, trying to find a vehicle and a circumstance where this would work, \" the lead saffire investigator said in a video posted june 6 on youtube. \" initially they'd get a ' not on my spacecraft'reaction. \" the cygnus cargo vessel compromise was eventually reached, and gizmodo notes nasa made sure to start the fire far away from the iss, so already anxious-astronauts hanging out there wouldn't get freaked out seeing the fire so close to their perilous perch.

Shana chavez had just gotten off work at a theisen's farm supply store last friday when she and another girl hopped on the back bumper of an suv while a 17-year-old male drove around the parking lot. At some point, shana fell from the vehicle, nbc news reports. Cedar rapids police found shana with serious injuries around 9: 30pm, reports kwwl, and she later died at a hospital. \" she got off work like 15 minutes [ before ] and then you know, made one mistake, \" says sister chevelle. Police initially told kwwl they were investigating whether anyone should be charged in the case, but they now say they aren't looking for anyone involved. \" when you consider that we require that people be belted inside the car for their safety, standing on the roof of the car, on the hood, or on the back bumper while a vehicle is moving is extremely dangerous, \" an officer says. \" car surfing can turn deadly with just one wrong movement by the driver or the person riding. \" \" be smart. Learn from this experience, learn from all this pain we're going through now, \" chevelle adds. \" hit a roller coaster or something, \" a local parent says. A gofundme page, set up to help with funeral expenses, describes shana as a girl who loved the outdoors, \" loved her family and friends with all of her heart and would do anything for someone in need. \" ( earlier this year, a woman was killed by her own empty car. )",

Obama wants to raise the minimum wage from $ 7.25 to $ 9 an hour by the end of 2015, reports the new york times. \" no one who works full time should have to live in poverty, \" he said. Obama also called for a significant expansion in preschool programs around the nation to make them available to every child. Newtown made clear it's time to pass tougher gun laws, said obama. He singled out the parents of hadiya pendleton, the young girl recently killed in chicago. \" they deserve a vote, \" he said. \" gabby giffords deserves a vote. The families of newtown deserve a vote. The families of aurora deserve a vote. The families of oak creek, and tucson, and blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence â€” they deserve a simple vote. \" after pushing a \" fix it first \" program to repair roads, bridges, and rail lines, obama added his annual joke: \" and i know that you want these job-creating projects in your districts. I've seen you all at the ribbon-cuttings. \" obama \" not only mentioned climate change but made clear that if congress didn't act, he would, \" writes chris cillizza at the washington post. He brought up superstorm sandy, wildfires, etc. â€” \" about as direct a call for action by congress on climate change as you will hear from a president. \" ( for the record, ted nugent \" seems to be in true pain during this climate change section, \" observed slate's dave weigel. ) \" the president devoted a large chunk of his speech to deficit reduction, but didn't propose anything new, \" writes damian paletta at the wall street journal. Obama also announced a nonpartisan commission to reform voting laws. \"when any americans â€” no matter where they live or what their party â€” are denied that right simply because they can't wait for five, six, seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals. \" conservative justices samuel alito, clarence thomas, and antonin scalia skipped the speech, notes politico.

As helicopters loomed overhead, muhammad hassan abdullah al-jibouri, 35, remembers hearing voices speaking kurdish and english before the door of his cell in hawija, iraq, opened. A police officer, jibouri was detained in retribution for his brother's escape from isis and tortured after militants found his cellphone held the numbers of two american soldiers who'd worked with iraqi police in hawija in 2008, reports the new york times. Militants were suspicious of anyone they suspected of contact with americans or kurds, and victims suffered electrical shocks, were smothered with plastic bags until they passed out, and were forced to watch videos of beheadings. Pieces of bread kept them alive. \" torture would continue unless there was a confession. A confession, however, meant execution, \" a freed captive says in a video, per the international business times. Another escapee, a member of the iraqi army, recalls isis ' arrival in hawija last year, noting militants cleared homes of weapons and money, then paid poor sunni men $ 50 to join them. They enforced a strict dress code and rules on how locals were to position their hands and fingers during prayers. Those who broke rules were sometimes beaten, as were those who tried to escape isis ' area of control. Though happy to be free, jibouri â€” who was taken to the kurdish autonomous region â€” says his wife and son are still in hawija. \" i can't see them no more, \" he says through tears.

        "summary": "\" a tidal wave of alzheimer's disease \" is now upon us and \" it's not going away unless we do something serious about it, \" a rep for the alzheimer's association tells cbs news. That after a cdc report notes that the rate of deaths from alzheimer's disease jumped 55 % in 15 years. In 1999, alzheimer's was linked to some 44,500 deaths, or 16.5 deaths per 100,000 people. By 2014, those figures had jumped to 93,500 deaths and a rate of 25.4 per 100,000 people, reports abc news. The cdc researchers used data from death certificates in the study, with nbc news noting that a number of factors are probably at play, including better diagnosis and an increased willingness of doctors to list it as the cause of death. But perhaps most importantly, people are living longer. \" age is the greatest risk factor for alzheimer's disease, \" so the alarming rate of deaths will only continue with an aging population, a researcher explains. While finding a cure for alzheimer's is still a priority, researchers say attention must also be given to patient care. The cdc report notes a quarter of deaths from alzheimer's in 2014 occurred at home, up from 14 % in 1999, suggesting many patients and their families can't afford professional care. \" nearly everyone in the final stages of alzheimer's needs constant care, \" which can be emotionally and physically draining for a healthy person, say researchers. But \" patients'spouses are often elderly, too, and have ailments of their own, \" a doctor adds.",

Some us military personnel stationed at the dmz say they can recite the speeches from memory at this point. But with the start of the winter olympics in pyeongchang, it appears north korea has given the speeches a rest. \" we've been hearing a lot more music, and a lot of it has been more classical, especially at night. \" un command duty officer lt. Cmdr. Daniel mcshane tells abc news. Mcshane says maybe the north switched to choral and folk music because so many north koreans are in the south for the olympics. \" or it could just be a coincidence, \" he says. \" maybe they've run out of speeches. \" elsewhere, un command chief of staff robert watt talks life on the dmz with global news. In addition to north korean officers peering through windows to observe their south korean counterparts and south korean soldiers rescuing a defector who had been shot by his north korean countrymen, watt discusses the odd communication method used since the north stopped answering its phone. \"we ' ll come down with a megaphone, \" he says. \"one of the translators will read the message to the north koreans.... The north koreans will send two soldiers down with a video camera and stand there videotaping it.

This is because jay carney is not a political pundit who lives to declare winners in washington dust-ups. But even taking carney at his word about winners, there sure were a heck of a lot of losers.

Mitch mcconnell: he, too, has earned some \" winner \" nods.

        "summary": "Scientists think they've figured out why the biggest whales â€” those of the baleen variety, including blue whales â€” got so big. As they explain in a study in proceedings of the royal society b, the researchers found that these behemoths didn't really become behemoths until about 4.5 million years ago. Their theory is that climate changes around that time created the perfect feeding conditions in the ocean for them to thrive. Specifically, glacial sheets forming in the northern hemisphere led to nutrient-rich runoffs in coastal waters, reports npr. In addition, upwelling currents brought even more nutrients up from the depths, resulting in great patches of krill and fish ( whale prey ) gorging on them, notes the atlantic. Another factor played a role: whales had to travel great distances to feed on these easy meals, and larger baleen ones thus had an advantage over their smaller cousins. \"all of a sudden â€” ' boom ' â€” we see them get very big, like blue whales, \" nick pyenson of the smithsonian institution's national museum of natural history tells the new york times. \"it's like going from whales the size of minivans to longer than two school buses. \" blue whales and their ilk had even more going for them. Because of their baleens â€” mouth filters made up of the same stuff as human fingernails â€” the whales could take big gulps and spit water back out without losing any fish in the process. Researchers believe this is why fossils show whales of about 30 feet in length began to balloon in size around this time, while smaller whales disappeared. Over a few million years, large whales increased from 10 tons in mass to 100 tons. ( humpback whales are surprising researchers. )",

Fossil records show that ancient whales were much smaller than the currently living behemoths. So when did whales get so big, and how? a new study suggests it might be due to changes in climate that affected the food that some whales eat: krill and small fish. Instead of being spread throughout the ocean, lots of krill started being packed into a small area. Bigger whales were simply more efficient at eating the dense pockets of krill, and they beat out their smaller cousins. These whales use filters to feed on the tiny krill. Known as baleens, they include the largest whale on earth â€” the blue whale. The baleen filter looks like bristles of a comb and is made up of keratin â€” the same stuff in our fingernails. To eat, the whale opens its mouth and takes in a huge gulp of water. Then it spits the water back out, and food like krill are caught in the baleen filter. It's a highly efficient way to eat, allowing whales to pack on the pounds. But according to stanford university researcher jeremy goldbogen, it can't be the only reason whales got so big. \" baleen evolved about 20 million years ago, and we didn't see the evolution of gigantism until about very recently, about 3 million to 5 million years ago. \" goldbogen's group looked back to see what was happening in the ancient oceans, and if there",

But for as long as whales have awed us with their great size, people have wondered how they became so colossal. In a study published tuesday in the journal proceedings of the royal society b, a team of researchers investigated gigantism in baleen whales, the filter-feeding leviathans that include blue whales, bowhead whales and fin whales. The marine mammals became jumbo-size relatively recently, they found, only within the past 4.5 million years. The cause? a climatic change that allowed the behemoths to binge-eat."

After the footage was posted on reddit, the video went viral, with many people expressing concern and downright horror at the sheer size of the creature. But while many have called into question the validity of the video, experts say the bird is, in fact, real, reports upi. It's what's called a brahma chicken, which the livestock conservancy calls the \" king of all poultry. \" brahma chickens were bred in the us using huge chickens imported from china. Males can reach a whopping 18 pounds, while females can range from 13 to 14; per the national chicken council, the live weight of broiler chickens ( which are bred for their meat ) tends to be about 6 pounds. Brahmas are considered a hardy breed that lays large brown eggs primarily from october to may, but the conservancy notes that \" because of the size of the hen, trampling of the chicks must be guarded against \" during the first days of a brahma chick's precarious early life.

        "summary": "One of three suspects being hunted in the charlie hebdo terrorist attack in paris has turned himself in to authorities more than 100 miles away near the border with belgium, authorities in france say. A police spokeswoman says hamyd mourad, 18, went to a police station, \" introduced himself, and was put in custody, \" reports the new york times. According to some reports, the suspect turned himself in after seeing his name appear in social media and has told investigators he was in school at the time of the attack that killed 12 people, including four beloved french cartoonists at the satirical newspaper. Some who say they're his classmates have been maintaining the same thing, tweeting under the hashtag #mouradhamydinnocent. In other developments: a huge manhunt is underway for brothers said kouachi and cherif kouachi, who are believed to have links to a yemeni terrorist network. Seven people connected to the suspects were arrested overnight in the paris area and in the towns of reims and charleville-mezieres, the bbc reports. France's prime minister says the brothers were already known to intelligence services and \" our main concern \" is preventing them from carrying out another attack. There have been unconfirmed reports that the brothers have been spotted on a highway in northern france, with weapons visible in the back of their vehicle, the guardian reports. Tens of thousands of parisians joined vigils last night, and france has declared today a day of national mourning. A moment of silence was observed at noon. In what a cnn affiliate describes as \" their only mistake, \" an identification card belonging to one of the kouachi brothers was found in a getaway car after the attack. There are conflicting accounts on how the slaughter during a charlie hebdo editorial meeting unfolded. Cnn reports that a doctor who treated survivors was told the killing wasn't random, but was a \" precision execution \" with the two masked attackers separating men from women, then reading out names of victims they wanted to kill. Others, however, including police sources and a writer who managed to sound the alarm, described the attack as complete carnage, with the gunmen trying to kill as many people as possible, the guardian reports. Le monde has published one bloody image of the interior of the magazine's office. It reports by way of charlie hebdo's lawyer that the next edition will be issued wednesday, with a million copies being printed. The typical weekly circulation is 45,000.",

I was wrong and i accept that. \" when durkin asked if he had sexually abused them, hastert replied, \" yes. \" one of hastert's accusers, previously ided in documents as \" individual d, \" was in court to confront him. Scott cross told the court he was 17 when hastert sexually abused him during a massage and that the abuse became \" his darkest secret as [ hastert ] became more powerful. \" he added he wasn't even sure he could take the stand until he got there and that he decided to testify after hastert's defense team approached his brother, an illinois politician, for a letter of support. Per the new york daily news, the sister of steven reinboldt, another of hastert's accusers ( reinboldt died in 1995 ), also addressed hastert in court, saying, \" don't be a coward â€¦ tell the truth, \" adding, per nbc news: \" i always wonder if you're sorry for what you did or if you're sorry you got caught. \" hastert had been accused of molesting four boys between the ages of 14 and 17 while at yorkville, but the statute of limitations has expired.

But a spokesman for the national transitional council says that contrary to earlier reports, there has been no confirmation that gadhafi's son motassim has been captured in sirte, although some fighters close to motassim have been seized. Celebratory gunfire and fireworks lit up the skies over tripoli and benghazi following early reports that motassim, gadhafi's fourth son and a former military commander, had been captured, reuters reports. Mustafa abdul-jalil, libya's de facto leader, told the telegraph that the ntc expects to declare final victory over gadhafi's forces within a week, clearing the way for elections next year. \" within less than a month we will form a transitional government and the youth and women will have a role in that, \" he said.",

        "summary": "Two million cat videos posted on youtube with around 26 billion views last year adds up to an awful lot of time watching funny cats, but it's not completely wasted time, according to an indiana university researcher. Media professor jessica gall myrick surveyed around 7,000 people and discovered that watching online cat videos increased their energy and positive emotions, according to a university press release. Myrick says she felt \" compelled to gather some data about this pop culture phenomenon, \" and while it may not seem like a serious topic, \" if we want to better understand the effects the internet may have on us as individuals and on society, then researchers can't ignore internet cats anymore. \" watching the videos helped get rid of negative emotions, so even if people are \" watching cat videos on youtube to procrastinate or while they should be working, the emotional pay-off may actually help people take on tough tasks afterward, \" myrick says. Her study echoes \" mood management theory \" from long before the age of online cats, which found that people lean toward content that makes them feel better or keeps up their good moods, the washington post notes. The study doesn't appear to have looked into the effects of cat videos on people who don't like cats: the survey was distributed on social media and some 36 % described themselves as cat people, while 60 % said they liked both cats and dogs.

        "summary": "Wednesday is the fourth anniversary of the sandy hook shooting, in which 20 elementary school students and six teachers were killed by a gunman in newtown, connecticut. It was the deadliest school shooting in us history and third deadliest us shooting of any kind. Here's what you need to know as the country remembers the tragedy: following the sandy hook shooting, president obama called for america to ignore politics and work together on \" common-sense gun laws, \" abc news reports. That he's leaving office without that happening â€” having watched two major gun-control bills die in the senate â€” is one of the biggest regrets of his presidency. So-called \" sandy hook truthers \" â€” people who believe the shooting and deaths were a hoax â€” have spent the past four years harassing the victims ' families. A piece at new york magazine asserts that donald trump isn't helping matters by aligning himself with conspiracy theorists such as alex jones of infowars. People speaks to a number of parents who lost children in the shooting to find out about their lives four years later. They spend their days being strong for their surviving children, working on gun-control legislation, and helping others around the world. Following the shooting, newtown received more than $ 45 million from charities and the government. The hartford courant digs into where that money went, discovering that most of it is being spent on mental health services â€” though one charity gave more than $ 65,000 to each of the victim's families. The guardian reports on what it calls a small victory for the victims ' families after obama on tuesday signed a bill into law to increase access to mental health care. Sandy hook parents had been pushing the bill for years, and one calls it their \" first big success at the federal level. \" photographer jb nicholas covered the shooting for the new york daily news, capturing a haunting image of a body bag leaving the school. On narratively, he has a message for sandy hook truthers: \" i know for a fact that the shooting really happened... F*** anyone who says otherwise. \" finally, an opinion piece on bearing arms calls anyone focusing on \" love \" during wednesday's anniversary â€” instead of how to get more guns in schools â€” \" mewling pukes \" and \" crisply-tailored cowards. \"",

        "summary": "North korea took things up yet another notch thursday by issuing detailed plans for a strike near guam â€” and some insults directed at president trump. Pyongyang's official korean central news agency said a plan to fire four hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missiles into waters 25 miles off guam will be presented to kim jong un for his approval within days, the guardian reports. General kim rak gyom, the head of north korea's strategic forces, was quoted as saying trump is \" bereft of reason \" and that \" absolute force \" is the only thing that will work on him. In other developments: load of nonsense. The north korean statement described trump's \" fire and fury \" threat as a \" load of nonsense \" and warned that pyongyang will be closely watching \" speech and behavior \" from the us, cnn reports. \" this is extremely getting on the nerves of the infuriated hwasong artillerymen \" of the korean people's army, the statement said. Stern and strong. South korea's military said any such action would meet a \" stern and strong \" response from seoul as well as washington, the ap reports. Japanese defense minister itsunori onodera said the launch would be considered an \" existential threat \" to japan and the country has the legal right to shoot the missiles down before they get near guam. Shaken markets. Asian stocks slumped after thursday's north korea announcement, partly because the country provided details of plans to fire missiles across some of the world's busiest shipping lanes, reuters reports. Missiles \" will cross the sky above shimane, hiroshima, and koichi prefectures of japan, \" kcna said. \" they will fly 3,356.7km ( 2,085.8 miles ) for 1,065 seconds and hit the waters 30 to 40km away from guam. \" mixed signals. The harsh rhetoric from trump combined with calming words from secretary of state rex tillerson and other administration members has led some critics to accuse the administration of sending mixed signals, possibly revealing a deep divide on north korea policy, the new york times reports. \" of all the countries and all the issues you deal with, north korea is not the one to be kludging together statements by the president and cabinet secretaries because the risk of miscalculation is so high, \" warned eurasia group's evan medeiros, a former obama adviser. A position of fear. According to the bbc, many people in guam feel that the latest threat is rhetorical and pyongyang will not carry out actions likely to cause the end of the regime. \" they're now telegraphing their punch, which means they don't want to have any misunderstandings",

People reports on the death of 58-year-old andrey suchilin, a russian guitarist who spurred an emergency landing of a transavia airlines plane in portugal. Per de telegraaf via wjw, suchilin's odor during the may 29 flight from spain to the netherlands was said to be so noxious other passengers began vomiting and fainting. Crew members moved suchilin to the plane's bathroom and tried to mask the smell with air freshener, but the pilots eventually decided it would be best to land. Now, however, it's revealed the reason suchilin caused such a stink was because his body tissues were dying due to necrosis after he apparently got a \" beach infection \" while vacationing in spain. \" the tragic and comic component of this whole situation is that i caught a disease, which... Makes a man quite stinky, \" he wrote may 30 on his facebook page. The progression of suchilin's ailment can be seen in increasingly dire status updates, many posted by his wife, lidia tikhonovich. Newsweek notes suchilin underwent several surgeries to stop the infection, but he eventually fell into a coma. Tikhonovich's updates culminate in one posted monday: \" andrei's gone. Alas. \" tikhonovich says their insurance company refused to pay for his medical care, saying their insurance had expired, and that they spent too much time fighting with the company after getting off the plane, hours suchilin could've spent getting treatment to save his life.

It is these qualities that have made her an extraordinary nurse, first at johns hopkins, then at mass general. Of patrick they say: patrick is one of the most genuinely caring and generous people on earth. His love for his family, his friends, and his home city of boston are infectious and memorable to all who encounter him. And about the two of them: we all remember bc pat -- innocent, perpetually polite, the ultimate boston boy who was nicknamed \" jesus \" in high school for his goodness. When he first started dating jess in 2006"

The bill passed the state senate by a 33-3 vote and sailed through the house 92-0. The expansion of the hate crime law was cheered by law enforcement groups, though critics noted that violence against police officers is close to an all-time low and those who target cops already face stiffer penalties, the new york times reports. Jim bueermann, a former police chief who's president of the police foundation research group, says it's good that the law \" can reinforce the notion that hatred of a group because of who they are has no place in our society, \" though he warns that the law's supporters may find it has unexpected consequences. \" at some point, someone might suggest that abortion physicians should also be protected, \" he says. \" that if you are hunted down because of your profession, whatever the profession, that should be a hate crime. \"",

It wasn't enough that the humans who happened upon the exotic creatures on the island of mauritius in the late 1500s slaughtered them for food and brought about their extinction less than 100 years later, but we then started using their name to be synonymous with stupid. This appears to be an unfair indignity, natural scientists report in the zoological journal of the linnean society. A ct scan of a well-preserved skull at the natural history museum in london in fact indicates that the dodo appears to have been rather intelligent. Using the brains and bodies of seven species of closely related pigeons as a guide, one researcher says the brains of dodos are \" right on the line, \" reports phys.org. \" it is really amazing what new technologies can bring to old museum specimens, \" says a study co-author. The dodo ( raphus cucullatus ) was a large and flightless bird last seen in 1662. Stony brook university researchers also report another surprising finding: the bird had a large olfactory bulb quite unusual among most birds, who tend to have exceptional eyesight. This could be related to the amount of time they spent close to the ground, likely sniffing around for food such as fruits, small land vertebrates, and marine animals like shellfish. The researchers also noted an unusual curve to the dodo's semicircular ear canal, which governs balance, but they have yet to devise a working hypothesis.

Just 182 species lock up more than half of the carbon stored in the vast forest, a study published in the journal nature communications finds.

The brazil nut tree, which can grow to be more than 100 feet tall, played a major role in carbon uptake despite its rank as only the 243rd most common species, scientific american notes. So could the world deal with its greenhouse gas problem by simply planting huge numbers of the most carbon-hungry trees? not a great idea, a study co-author says. \" given the amount of changes that are occurring in tropical regions, such as with the climate and with land-use changes, in the future there might be different species that become more important, \" she tells the bbc, explaining that only a very diverse forest is properly equipped to deal with a changing environment.

Dueling columnists weigh in: guess what: the deal is exactly what president obama was going for, an agreement that â€” when details were leaked a few weeks ago â€” no one thought iran would agree to, writes fred kaplan at slate. The interim agreement requires iran to stop enriching uranium above 5 %, freeze the stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.5 %, neutralize the stockpile enriched to 20 % so it cannot be used for weapons, halt work on centrifuges and enrichment facilities, permit more and better inspections, and more. \" the agreement makes it impossible for the iranians to make any further progress toward making a nuclear weapon in the next six months â€” and, if the talks break down after that, and the iranians decide at that point to start building a nuclear arsenal, it will take them much longer to do so. \" kaplan calls it \" a triumph, \" adding that only a very small percentage of the sanctions on iran will be freed up in exchange. It's a first step \" rife with historic possibilities. \" on politico, aaron david miller takes a more wary approach. Yes, this deal could end up being a \" historic \" part of us-iran relations, but \" we should be careful about putting on the party hats and breaking out the champagne â€” at least for now, anyway. \" he lays out five reasons why. Among them: israel isn't happy with the deal, which could make for \" a diplomatic trainwreck. \" but perhaps the most serious problem: in miller's opinion, the deal doesn't go far enough to put the brakes on iran's nuclear program ( it should have \" limit[ ed ] centrifuges and [ sought ] ironclad assurances that iran can't reconvert its enriched uranium stockpile into useable material \" ), meaning we must consider the consequences if a comprehensive accord is not reached within the six-month limit â€” which it likely won't be. \" we need to be honest with ourselves about what's achievable. \"",

Such is the conclusion of a major new study from researchers at oregon state and harvard, who pored over data from 73 sites over the world going back 11,300 years. \" by the year 2100, we will be beyond anything human society has ever experienced, \" says project leader shaun marcott at oregon state. The research covers the entire span of what's known as the holocene period, which began after the last ice age, reports the new york times. After an initial spike in temperatures at the start of the holocene made it warmer than it is today, average temperatures plateaued, then declined for thousands of years. That changed in the last century, with temperatures rising a startling 1.3 degrees over 100 years. Today's temperatures are hotter than 75 % of the entire holocene era, and they will exceed the hottest temperatures in the coming decades, say the scientists.

            "New york ( reuters health ) - people being tested for sexually transmitted diseases can now use their computers or iphones to quickly get the results, and experts hope this easy access will make them more likely to honestly share their std status with their partners. The new service, called healthvana, allows patients access to their lab results once they are completed at a clinic or medical center, usually within days of being tested. Patients then receive an email instructing them to log-in to the secure online portal. Results can also be viewed through the official iphone app. All of the records are easily accessible, shareable and verified. Records are also time-stamped.

Among them: the all-important blowout preventer wasn't recertified in 2005, as required by federal regulations, one worker responsible for maintaining the equipment told investigators yesterday. Transocean tells the ap that the blowout preventer wasn't recertified because it was being constantly maintained. Re-certifying the five-story device can take as long as three months, because it must be removed from the water and disassembled. Meanwhile, the wall street journal has learned that just 12 hours before the explosion, a bp engineer sent out an email changing the procedure for a key safety test. Bp chose to remove an unusually large amount of heavy drilling fluid for its pressure test. The company said it wanted to avoid damaging a key seal, but the procedure is unorthodox, and confused some workers. The day-shift manager during the test told bp's internal investigators that it might have been done \"to save time. \"",

        "summary": "Sure, the last two winters have been bitterly cold â€” but scientists in zurich and california say this has nothing to do with climate change. In fact, they say extreme cold snaps will become rarer as the climate continues to warm, eureka alert reports. The argument goes like this: the arctic has been warming for decades, and temperatures in mid-latitudes ( or temperate zones, where most of us live ) vary less often when there's less temperature difference between the tropics and the poles. Think of it this way: if air masses were all the same, there would theoretically be no fluctuation. So, less difference, less fluctuation. The study in the journal of climate says climate scenarios support this theory, and simulations by the intergovernmental panel on climate change came to similar conclusions. But this doesn't spell an end to extreme temperatures: \" despite lower temperature variance, there will be more extreme warm periods in the future because the earth is warming, \" says study leader tapio schneider. His team's research runs against another theory â€” that the warming arctic is weakening the polar jet stream, a large, powerful wind that's driven by the temperature difference between polar regions and the balmy tropics. A weaker stream is more \" wavy, \" creating more temperature changes in mid-latitudes. But schneider's not buying it: \" the waviness of the jet stream that makes our day-to-day weather does not change much, \" he says. Another theory holds that smog from asia is worsening storms over the pacific ocean and possibly giving us colder winters, wgbh reports.

Do it eight times, and the passphrase is unbreakable with any known technology and should be safe until at least 2050.

On her website, modi also recommends clients capitalize random letters or add symbols so their final password is \" not the exact same one that i gave you. \" she's sold about 30 so far. Modi says it's important to have strong passwords as hackers and computers get more sophisticated, even though most people her age are busy sharing the simple passwords to their instagram accounts with each other. \" i don't think my friends understand, \" modi tells ars technica. \" but i think it's cool. \" ( this list of the worst passwords shows how lazy we are. )",

            "A coroner's official says an autopsy on jani lane, the former lead singer of the metal rock band warrant, did not reveal what killed the rocker.

He joined warrant in 1984 and wrote such hits as \" heaven, \" \" down boys \" and \" cherry pie. \" he had an on-and-off relationship with the band, leaving it in 1992 before returning and quitting again several times.",

( the figure is way higher by another metric. ) writing for the london review of books, scottish novelist andrew o ' hagan draws up a profile of these killers based largely on their written manifestos. \" someone, perhaps not a million miles from you, whose name we don't yet know but whose face is camera-ready, whose conscience is clearing before the fact, is preparing a biography of his mentality in advance of a shooting massacre, \" o ' hagan writes. \" he is almost certainly a he, and he is unhappy, and he is already fully armed. He is probably on zoloft. He is likely to be a virgin with a history of isolation.... He believes he has a system of thought, his own, that education or company philosophy can't get close to, and his feelings of inferiority quickly turn bombastic. \" as lonely as these mostly young men are, they are certainly not alone, and they have evolved dangerously from generations past, o ' hagan adds. \" boys like that used to wear anoraks and read tolkien and swap sci-fi comics, or get into heavy metal, overcoming shyness or adolescent angst with dark otherworldliness that lightened with age. But for some the darkness can prove engulfing. \" o ' hagan pulls from a long list of 21st-century killers, one that largely overlaps with a list of the deadliest us mass shootings since 1984 reported on by the los angeles times. O ' hagan's conclusion is not a hopeful one. \" there have always been killers and they have often left pieces of writing behind, \" he writes, but now it's easier than ever â€” all it takes is \" a smartphone and a set of grievances. \" he ends with an excerpt by killer elliot rodger: \" i didn't start this war. I wasn't the one who struck first. But i will finish it by striking back. I will punish everyone. And it will be beautiful. \" click for o ' hagan's full piece.",

And lest you think the wood-burning portion of the program was anything like a tv yule log, think again: the fire burned live, rather than on a repeating loop, and the wood was continually replenished ( with help from viewers, who sent in recommendations for where new wood should be placed ). \" i couldn't go to bed because i was so excited, \" said one viewer, who insisted she wasn't being ironic. Stephen colbert had some fun with the program, joking that it \" destroyed the other top norwegian shows like so you think you can watch paint dry and the amazing glacier race. \"",

The agency described a case of man-to-man sexual transmission in january. The case, which was previously disclosed by health officials in texas without identifying the genders of the partners, was the first known case of sexual transmission of zika within the united states in the current epidemic. It involved a dallas resident who became infected with zika through a mosquito bite while visiting venezuela and then infected his male partner through unprotected sex upon his return. Both had relatively mild symptoms, and blood was not detected in either man's semen. Previous cases of suspected sexual transmission involved men with blood in their semen, leading doctors to speculate that sexual transmission took place only when the testes or prostate was so heavily infected that bleeding occurred.",

The department of justice named the target as \" jane doe, \" in a news release, but carole baskin, who runs a sanctuary called big cat rescue in florida, has come forward in a video to say she was maldonado-passage's intended victim. A post by the rescue group says maldonado-passage \" had made threats online over a period of years including a video of him shooting in the head a blow up doll dressed to look like carole and an image hanging her in effigy. \" baskin and maldonado-passage have a long history of friction, with baskin's group accusing him of animal abuse at his private zoo and maldonado-passage making no secret of his disdain for baskin. In 2013, he was ordered to pay a $ 1 million settlement to her group for trademark infringement after using images from the sanctuary. The feds say maldonado-passage first asked someone to recommend a hit man, and that person then directed him to an undercover fbi agent posing as a killer. Maldonado-passage allegedly paid the impostor $ 3,000. If the name sounds familiar, it might be because \" joe exotic \" ran for president in 2016 and governor of oklahoma in 2017.

A large portion of the bluff fell into the lake on tuesday afternoon, leaving a portion of the house dangling off the cliff. \"just best guess looking at this map, [ the home ] is probably 60 to 80 yards from the lake, \" said mark wilson, chief deputy with the hill county sheriff's office. \"yes, there's a lot of erosion. \" according to authorities, the home is not a public safety concern, and the electricity to the home has been shut off. Security for the private community is not allowing visitors or reporters on the scene. Wilson says that representatives with the army corps of engineers are in the water behind the house, evaluating the home and keeping boaters from getting too close. \"we have some of our lake stuff that are taking photos to get a picture of how the erosion is going, \" said randy cephus with the fort worth district of",

The home â€” with an appraised value of more than $ 700,000 â€” was built in 2008. Stack bowers, vice president of double diamond incorporated, said he never expected this home to inch off a cliff. His company developed the white bluff subdivision and the lot for this home. Hill county records list the builder as hillco construction of whitney, texas. No one answered our any of our repeated calls to the company on wednesday, nor was it possible to leave a message. News 8 then searched for information on how this home was built, curious if there was ever any concern for how close it was to the edge of the cliff. We learned that hill county doesn't require building permits, and double diamond, inc. Said the proximity of the cliff never worried them. \"no, we didn't have any requirement as far as where they could build or not, \" bowers said. The homeowners reported a stress crack running along the property line and under the house earlier this year. That's when they notified double diamond. \"the homeowner did have a geological study done"

The 4,400-foot-long bridge is part of the huangrui highway, according to india today, and is expected to cut the travel time between guizhou and yunnan provinces by 3.5 hours. Construction on the beipanjiang bridge started in 2013, and its two sides were finally connected last september. It cost approximately $ 143 million. China is also home to the world's second and third highest bridges â€” the sidu river bridge and puli bridge, the telegraph reports. The sidu river bridge is approximately 210 feet lower than the new beipanjiang bridge. According to usa today, while the beipanjiang bridge might be the world's highest, it's oddly not its tallest. The latter measurement includes the height of any structures built on the bridge, giving the record to the millau viaduct in france.",

        "summary": "Rod blagojevich's oldest daughter thinks former president obama should have used his powers to get her father released from prison, the chicago sun times reports. Blagojevich's wife patti had been posting on facebook in the days leading up to the end of obama's term about her hope that her husband would be pardoned or see his sentence commuted; when that didn't happen, patti posted â€” at daughter amy's request â€” an open letter the 20-year-old wrote to obama. The letter was posted thursday night, though it appears to have since been taken down. In it, amy wrote that obama had \" lost my respect. You've broken my heart once again, and you've betrayed the concept of justice like many other heartless individuals have done before you. I thought you were different. I thought you had a moral compass. Turns out you're just like the rest â€” selfish and spineless. \" rod blagojevich was convicted of corruption charges in 2012 ( partially related to his attempt to sell an appointment to obama's vacant senate seat in illinois in 2008 ) and sentenced to 14 years in prison; he's scheduled to be released in 2024. Amy blagojevich said in her letter that she and her sister wrote letters to obama, which unnamed people promised to put directly into his hands, in which they spoke of the \" heartache and desperation \" they've felt over the past eight years. She insisted her father didn't do anything illegal and condemned obama for allowing the release of others who have committed \" reprehensible crimes, \" including chelsea manning, but not her father. There's much more where that came from; the sun times has the entire 1,511-word letter. It's not going over well â€” journal star columnist phil luciano, for example, calls it \" pathetic. \" and over at the chicago tribune, columnist eric zorn says the person amy should be mad at is actually her dad.",

That's the message from a harvard medical school study published in the british medical journal that appears to show patient mortality rate increases with the age of a doctor. The increase is small but significant: in a study of more than 735,000 elderly patients ( 65 and older ) admitted to the hospital between 2011 and 2014 â€” in which researchers accounted for such variables as the severity of patients ' conditions â€” the 30-day mortality rate was 12.1 % when doctors were 60 and older, 11.3 % with doctors 50 to 59, 11.1 % with doctors 40 to 49, and 10.8 % with doctors under 40, reports ars technica. That means doctors 60 and above â€” whose care was more expensive â€” would encounter one additional death per 77 patients than doctors 40 and younger, per a release. That's \" comparable to the difference in death rates observed between patients at high risk for heart disease who are treated with proper heart medications and those who receive none, \" and therefore \" clinically important, \" study co-author anupam jena explains. However, older doctors who saw lots of patients weren't associated with a boost in mortality rates. The higher caseloads of these doctors may help them maintain their clinical skills, whereas younger doctors, although likely to be up to date on the latest methods and treatments, may see hands-on skills fade if they don't see lots of patients, researchers explain. They conclude the \" continuing medical education of physicians could be important. \" ( doctors rake in the big bucks. )",

What spurred the boycott: a february article in the korea times on kaist's collaboration with hanwha to join \" the global competition to develop autonomous arms. \" walsh says he wrote to kaist for details but didn't hear back. Kaist president sung-chul shin is trying to tamp down concerns, noting in a statement to times higher education the university won't \" conduct any research activities counter to human dignity, including autonomous weapons lacking meaningful human control. \" walsh says kaist's response still leaves \" some questions unanswered. \" per the verge, some experts say fighting autonomous weapons is \" futile, \" as it's too hard to figure out what human control means.

And a boston chipotle was linked to a norovirus outbreak that sickened 80 or so college students. Those cases led to a cdc investigation and the temporary closing of chipotle locations.

        "summary": "A 63-year-old calhoun county, iowa, man was none too pleased about an oil pipeline being constructed between his home and his well and decided to quietly protest â€” only to end up briefly jailed. Homer martz raised the american flag upside down, with the chinese flag above, and was on friday arrested and charged with desecration of the flag. That's a simple misdemeanor, reports north iowa today. \" do you know what an upside-down american flag means? it means distress, \" martz told the messenger news in advance of his arrest. The messenger news has a photo of martz's flagpole, which also shows a sign he erected on it reading, \" in china there is no freedom, no protesting, no due process. In iowa? in america? \" the messenger news has the backstory on the dakota access llc pipeline, which will carry crude oil from north dakota to illinois and has received formal approval from iowa; martz says he had been told the pipeline wouldn't end up on his land, and was never invited to meetings regarding it. The well is deeded to martz but is actually on his neighbor's land. The neighbor, ken anderson, didn't sign a voluntary easement and so dakota access obtained one via eminent domain. Among martz's concerns: \" pipes, when you dig under a pipeline and you don't put it back on solid ground, that's when they freeze. That's what they're going to do. \" the ap reports flag desecration is punishable by up to 30 days in jail in iowa. North iowa today reports a court date has not been set.
