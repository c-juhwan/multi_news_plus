        "summary": "It seems highly unlikely that three men who pulled off a daring escape from san francisco's alcatraz island prison in 1962 survived, though their feat spawned a clint eastwood film and has become the stuff of legends. Now dutch scientists have released a study based on interactive models that claims frank morris, john anglin, and clarence anglin could have actually made it across the nearly 1.5 miles of hazardous bay waters to the mainland, the washington post reports. Everything would have had to come together just so — including their leaving at the right time and rowing in the right direction in their makeshift raft made from 50 raincoats, complete with hand-made wooden paddles and musical instrument used as a pump, according to fbi archives ( which also note the men put plaster heads topped with real human hair in their beds to trick the night guards ). The research team led by rolf hut used an interactive model originally designed to measure the bay's sea-level rise, the post notes. The scientists pored over tidal records for the night of june 11, 1962, and plugged them into the model, then released 50 \" virtual boats \" every half-hour, a scientist tells the bbc. The model determined that the prisoners might have avoided the worst currents if they had left between 11pm and midnight and paddled directly \" northwards with a speed of almost 1 km per hour, an almost olympian effort, \" hut notes on his blog. Then they could have reached the north side of the golden gate bridge instead of succumbing to reversing tides and an almost certain death from hypothermia, hut says, per the bbc. In other words: a different fate than many people have assumed for the past 52 years. ( earlier this year, a hidden fortress was found under alcatraz. )",

Most muslim youths in britain or france do consider themselves british or french. \" it's less clear-cut in belgium, and the fractured nature extends to law enforcement and politics. \" add to this the fact that belgium has long been a clearing house for illegal arms deals and that its geographical situation makes it a perfect launch-pad for attacks on neighboring countries. \"",

The telegraph reports that scientists have previously floated neutron radiation as the way the shroud, said to be the burial cloth of jesus, came to purportedly bear his image; similarly, heritage daily reports neutron radiation has been suggested as interfering with the dating of the shroud. But no legitimate source of such radiation had been identified. But professor alberto carpinteri's research into piezonuclear fission reactions has led him to believe the earthquake would have produced high-frequency pressure waves in the earth's crust that would have caused those neutrons to be emitted; the particles then \" induced the image formation on the shroud's linen fibers \" by interacting with the nitrogen atoms in the fabric, explains carpinteri. Further, he says the radiation would have raised the shroud's level of carbon-14 isotopes, giving it an artificially youthful age when carbon-14 dating was done on it. But skeptics abound, reports livescience. Asks one, why is \" the material here...

The automaker said it still did not know exactly how many models had been given exaggerated fuel ratings. But it said it now believed it had been using unapproved methods since 1991 — a period that covers dozens of vehicle introductions and millions of cars and trucks.

        "summary": "Foes and fans alike can agree on one thing about donald trump's big speech at the gop convention: it was really, really long. According to c-span, the 76-minute acceptance speech was the longest since at least 1972. The speech — in which trump portrayed america as a very troubled place and himself as the man to fix it — was a lot less uplifting than the typical acceptance speech, analysts say, though it certainly met with approval from the crowd at the quicken loans arena. A roundup of reactions: critics said the speech \" offered a gloomy, forbidding vision to a nation that prides itself on optimism, \" writes niall stanage at the hill, but it was good enough to stabilize the gop as the spotlight turns to hillary clinton, and it ended a messy convention on a positive note. Trump gave the crowd what it wanted: \" a command performance of the tough-talking, details-free approach that won him the nomination in the first place, \" writes chris cillizza at the washington post, who decides the speech probably helped trump, though undecided voters might not agree with his \" deeply dystopian and dark \" perception of america in 2016. Democratic and republican speechwriters alike were \" stupefied \" by trump's failure to use the speech to tell his own story. \" it's a lost opportunity, \" says former george w. Bush speechwriter matt latimer, who had been expecting anecdotes that would make the candidate seem like less of a caricature. \" a little humanity and self-reflection is usually very powerful in a speech, \" he says. The \" raw, at times powerful, at times meandering \" address was the trump \" stump speech on steroids, \" and while it was easily \" the most competent, professional, pre-written and telepromptered address of trump's career, \" it's not going to do much to expand his voter base, writes glenn thrush at politico. \" give him credit for this: @realdonaldtrump is a dark, disturbed man &amp; he sees in the country what he sees in the mirror, \" tweeted former mitt romney speechwriter stuart stevens. This was \" probably the best speech he could have given, \" writes marc ambinder at the week, who believes it was aimed squarely at angry white working-class voters in the rust belt — a group that could hand trump the presidency. \" if he can motivate a million more people across five states to vote and a million fewer people in another five states to stay home — donald trump can win, \" he writes. Nate silver at fivethirtyeight believes it's too early to say how the speech will play out. \"",

New energy minister volodymyr demchyshyn insisted today, per reuters, that he's doing what he can to speed things up so ukrainians without electricity will get power back soon. \" the situation is under control, and the unit will be under repair until december 5th, \" said a ministry statement issued yesterday, as per cnn. The initial report about what happened at the zaporizhia plant came out on monday, but it didn't gain steam until pm arseniy yatsenyuk addressed it at today's meeting, the ap notes. Demchyshyn assures the public that the problem originated in the electricity transmission system ( not the reactor itself ) and that there are other reasons that also contributed to the \" imbalance of the power supply, \" including not enough coal in power plants ' warehouses and low temperatures, cnn notes.

Police tell the washington post that the bar fight that left the 22-year-old university of arizona grad dead was sparked by his selfie request. Greek police rep theodore chronopoulos says the bar on zakynthos island was hosting a night for serbians last friday, and a 33-year-old serbian patron had an issue with the waitress regarding the selfie. The rep didn't elaborate further; cbs news has a somewhat different angle, reporting surveillance video shows a male and female taking a selfie near henderson before the fight broke out. The serbian is suspected of being one of as many as 15 people who began fighting, some of whom chased a fleeing henderson from the bar and beat him to death in a mere 30 seconds, says chronopoulos. Indeed, cbs news says in the span of fewer than 20 seconds the video captures a group starting to beat henderson and then backing away from his motionless body. The ap reports nine men — one greek, seven serbians, and a brit of serbian origin — were charged with intentional homicide. Henderson had planned to launch a clothing line and was in greece to do a photo shoot for it, reports the post.",

Authorities know about dozens of tunnels built under the border by his sinaloa cartel, and there are likely more. \"everything indicates that el chapo would be able to visit the us: he's very smart, he has well-trained operatives, and he has experts in building tunnels, \" one author and cartel expert tells the guardian.",

        "summary": "A new source of friction has emerged between president trump and us intelligence officials, this time over his travel ban. A report out of an office in the department of homeland security challenges trump's assertion that blocking travelers from seven muslim-majority countries will make the nation any safer, reports the ap. The report concludes that \" country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity, \" per the wall street journal. A white house spokesman, however, dismissed the report as shoddy and politically motivated, and said the president is awaiting a more complete one that is \" driven by data and intelligence and not politics, \" says spokesman michael short. A spokesman for the dhs acknowledged the authenticity of the report by the office of intelligence and analysis, but characterized it as \" commentary, \" adding, \"it is clear on its face that it is an incomplete product that fails to find evidence of terrorism by simply refusing to look at all the available evidence. \" with his initial travel ban blocked by federal courts, trump has promised to issue a revised order next week. And it does appear that a different intel assessment is in the works: earlier this week, cnn quoted a senior white house official who said the dhs and the justice department \" are working on an intelligence report that will demonstrate that the security threat for these seven countries is substantial. \" the journal is skeptical. It found that of 180 people charged with \" jihadist terrorism-related crimes \" in the us, only 11 were from the seven nations in question ( syria, iraq, iran, libya, yemen, sudan, and somalia ).",

The fire flared as southern california sweltered under temperatures that hit the mid-90s in many places. At its height, the flames put about 3,000 homes at risk, although not under imminent threat, fire officials said. \" we're dealing with a fire that's moving in every direction simultaneously...

Three homes were damaged but the extent of the damage wasn't clear, los angeles county fire capt. Keith mora said. Some other buildings, including some at a city park, also were damaged. The fire started as three blazes that erupted after a car hit a power pole and knocked down electrical lines. One fire in the west hills area of los angeles was quickly doused but blazes in calabasas joined and raced through drought-dry brush in hills surrounded by developments. The blaze grew to 200 acres in a matter of hours. Embers ignited trees and clumps of brush within yards of million-dollar homes. Smoke could be seen for miles. Around 200 firefighters, aided by bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters, had the blaze 15 % contained by late saturday night.",

Now scientists say that may actually be giving us more flavorful cups of coffee, to boot, according to a study published in scientific reports. Researchers at the university of bath tried grinding coffee beans kept at various temperatures, from room temperature to -320 degrees fahrenheit. They found the colder the beans prior to grinding, the bolder the flavor of the resulting coffee, phys.org reports. \" grinding coffee may seem quite straightforward, \" the co-owner of a coffee shop involved in the study says. \" but like the whole world of coffee, the subtleties of the process have a huge impact on the flavor and quality of the cup of coffee. \" the reason? chilling the beans allows for \" finer and more uniform \" particles in grinding, allowing for more flavor compounds to be extracted during brewing. \" subtle changes in particle size distributions make a huge difference in rate of extraction, \" phys.org quotes researcher dr. Christopher hendron as saying. Ergo, cold beans take less time to brew and can create more coffee. \"we anticipate these results will influence the production of coffee industrially, as well as contribute to how we store and use coffee daily, \" the study says. Boing boing reports chilling beans will make a bigger difference in flavor with more \" grind-sensitive \" methods of brewing, such as espresso, as opposed to drip coffee. ( coffee may not cause cancer after all... Unless it's served above 149 degrees. )",

Part of what's so mysterious about the fungus: scientists don't know if it originated abroad or has always been here and is only now causing issues. And it doesn't have a uniform effect: the mortality rate for infected massasauga rattlesnakes is 80 % to 90 %; while all of massachusetts ' five rattlesnake populations have been hit by the fungus, it's not experiencing the high mortality rate. \" it does seem to be a disease that has different effects in different areas, \" confirmed a microbiologist with the center. There are no reports of the fungus infecting humans, according to the northeast partners in amphibian and reptile conservation, but anyone who touches an infected snake should wash with care afterward.",

The 38-year-olds used \" hundreds \" of false identities to order and pick up items at locations across the state, netting $ 750,000 between 2014 and 2016, reports usa today. Danijel glumac benefited, too. Police say the 29-year-old accomplice made $ 500,000 selling the stolen goods for a profit to a buyer in new york. The buyer then raised prices again before offering the products for sale to the public, including on amazon, per marketwatch. \" consumer fraud not only unjustly enriches the perpetrator, it causes all of us to pay higher retail prices, \" minkler said monday in announcing sentences for the accused, all three of whom accepted guilty pleas and must pay $ 1.2 million in restitution. Glumac, of indianapolis, was sentenced to two years in prison for money laundering and fencing stolen products. The finans, from the muncie-anderson area, were sentenced to just under six years ( 71 months and 68 months, respectively ) for federal mail fraud and money laundering, though prosecutors said they also considered that the pair had bounced checks, rented houses and cars without paying, and sold stolen sports equipment on facebook, per a release.",

According to the crowd-sourced mass shooting tracker, that act was the 24th mass shooting in the united states during the first 21 days of february and the 42nd mass shooting overall in 2016. Mass shootings, defined as instances in which four or more people ( which can include the gunman ) are shot and killed or injured, have so far taken 62 lives and injured 142 people. The pace of mass shootings in 2016 is up slightly since last year, when there had been 34 such shootings by feb. 21. There are many ways that researchers and authorities define \" mass shooting. \" the gun violence archive excludes the shooter from the tally of injured and killed. By that definition, there have been 27 mass shootings this year.

Users are suggesting that trump's tweets, including the recent one showing a wwe wrestling video in which he appears to clobber \" cnn, \" violate twitter's terms of use due to cyberbullying, harassment, and abuse. Some are calling for other users to report trump's account, with the hashtag #twitterbantrump gaining popularity. Newsday points out that some of trump's tweets, like those against morning joe co-host mika brzezinski, do seem to violate this line in the terms of service: \" you may not incite or engage in the targeted abuse or harassment of others. \" but twitter reviewed at least one of trump's recent tweets ( the wwe one ) and told cnn sunday it doesn't violate any rules. So, at least for now, trump's account won't be suspended. Adrienne lafrance writes for the atlantic that trump is testing the social media site's harassment policy, laying out the entire policy ( which also includes clauses against \" violent threats \" and \" hateful conduct \" ). \" what's a company like twitter to do when one of its users — who is also the president of the united states, by the way — incessantly publishes attacks against individuals? \" she writes. \" nothing, apparently. At least nothing yet.

According to a new study, marine animals could be ingesting our garbage, reports the verge. Up to 99 % of the most microscopic plastic particles in the ocean is missing, says a study co-author. Science mag reports that they went looking for it between 2010 and 2011 around five large ocean gyres — the most famous such island of waste is the great pacific garbage patch — and augmented their search with studies of 3,070 samples from other expeditions, according to livescience. What did they find? that there is at most 40,000 tons of plastic in our oceans, even though humans produce 300 million tons of plastic a year, and 0.1 % of that ends up in the oceans via rivers, floods, storms, or ships, says science mag. The ocean's plastics are microscopic — ground to tiny pieces by waves and solar radiation until it looks like fish food. A scientist not associated with the study says it's \" indisputable \" that lanternfish and other small fish are eating the plastic — and it's impossible to know exactly how much. These small fish, which are likely ingesting toxins like ddt, pcbs, or mercury, are then gobbled by commercial fish. \"we are part of this food web, \" says a study co-author.

Alternatively, the garbage may be traveling deep into the ocean's interior. \" the deep ocean is a great unknown, \" study co-author andrés cózar, an ecologist at the university of cadiz in spain, said in an email. \" sadly, the accumulation of plastic in the deep ocean would be modifying this mysterious ecosystem — the largest of the world — before we can know it. \" researchers drew their conclusion about the disappearing trash by analyzing the amount of plastic debris floating in the ocean, as well as global plastic production and disposal rates.

            "High concentrations of floating plastic debris have been reported in remote areas of the ocean, increasing concern about the accumulation of plastic litter on the ocean surface. Since the introduction of plastic materials in the 1950s, the global production of plastic has increased rapidly and will continue in the coming decades. However, the abundance and the distribution of plastic debris in the open ocean are still unknown, despite evidence of affects on organisms ranging from small invertebrates to whales. In this work, we synthetize data collected across the world to provide a global map and a first-order approximation of the magnitude of the plastic pollution in surface waters of the open ocean. Abstract there is a rising concern regarding the accumulation of floating plastic debris in the open ocean. However, the magnitude and the fate of this pollution are still open questions.

One disturbing possibility: fish are eating it. If that's the case, \"there is potential for this plastic to enter the global ocean food web, \" says carlos duarte, an oceanographer at the university of western australia, crawley. \"and we are part of this food web. \" humans produce almost 300 million tons of plastic each year. Most of this ends up in landfills or waste pits, but a 1970s national academy of sciences study estimated that 0.1 % of all plastic washes into the oceans from land, carried by rivers, floods, or storms, or dumped by maritime vessels.

        "summary": "You've heard the spiel: always finish your course of antibiotics, even if you feel better sooner. The idea is that even though you may feel better, the harmful bacteria in your body needs to be completely wiped out to keep it from developing antibiotic resistance. But that might be entirely wrong, reports the guardian. \" the idea that stopping antibiotic treatment early encourages antibiotic resistance is not supported by evidence, while taking antibiotics for longer than necessary increases the risk of resistance, \" uk experts in infectious diseases write in an editorial in the british medical journal. They cite previous trials to suggest courses of antibiotics lasting three to five days may be just as effective as longer courses at eradicating most bacteria, like e. Coli, though they acknowledge more studies need to be done. They also note there are exceptions — tuberculosis, for example — that require longer courses. But they argue most long courses of antibiotics are prescribed out of an abundance of caution and raise the risk that bacteria will develop resistance. The chair of the uk's royal college of general practitioners agrees more research is needed: she tells the bbc she \" cannot advocate widespread behavior change on the results of just one study, \" as courses of antibiotics are designed for individual conditions and \" improvement in symptoms does not necessarily mean the infection has been completely eradicated. \" a cdc official tells scientific american that antibiotics should only be stopped early on the advice of a doctor.

Blackwater founder erik prince has floated a plan to the white house that it turn over most of its military duties in the country to private contractors, reports usa today. The us currently has 8,400 troops there, though their mission is to train and advise, not engage in combat. Prince would replace them with 5,500 contractors, most of them former special ops troops. They would be supported by a private air force of about 90 planes. One key point: they would wear afghan uniforms and operate under afghan command. \"at what point do you say a conventional military approach in afghanistan is not working, \" says prince. \"maybe we say that at 16 years. \" the newspaper says defense chief jim mattis and national security adviser hr mcmaster are leery, while adviser steve bannon is more open to the idea. The navy times notes that the proposal would likely run into legal trouble. Current defense law stipulates that \" the use of combat power against enemy forces or hostile actors is inherently in the purview of the u.s. Government. \" contractors can provide assistance, but prince's plan goes way beyond that.

A new study tries to answer the question of how little it would take to make bird flu easily spreadable. The conclusion: 5 gene mutations. Controversial dutch virologist ron fouchier in 2011 found the virus could go airborne — something health officials fear could mean an overwhelming pandemic — with nine or more mutations in ferrets, whose immune systems react to h5n1 much as our own do. He and his fellow researchers set out to find the minimum number of mutations needed to make that happen, the los angeles times reports. A ferret was infected with a genetically altered version of the virus and made to share air with another ferret — who eventually became sick. The researchers then uncovered the five mutations at play, two of which made the virus ' ability to adhere to respiratory tract cells more robust. The other mutations bolstered the virus'stability and ability to replicate. Two big things to keep in mind: one, it's not known how likely these mutations are to occur outside a lab setting. \" this certainly does not mean that h5n1 is now more likely to cause a pandemic, \" says fouchier. Second, the altered virus wasn't as deadly as h5n1; fouchier suggests this is because it hit upper, not lower, airway cells. But critics still say toying with h5n1 is dangerous. It could be some time before we see any benefit from the research, a microbiologist tells npr, \" and we have, meanwhile, just bought ourselves even more risk. \"",

New research shows the h5n1 flu virus could become easily transmissible among people if it acquired just five genetic mutations. ( kin cheung / associated press ) it's a flu virus so deadly that scientists once halted research on the disease because governments feared it might be used by terrorists to stage a biological attack. Yet despite the fact that the h5n1 avian influenza has killed 60 % of the 650 humans known to be infected since it was identified in hong kong 17 years ago, the \"bird flu \" virus has yet to evolve a means of spreading easily among people. Now dutch researchers have found that the virus needs only five favorable gene mutations to become transmissible through coughing or sneezing, like regular flu viruses. World health officials have long feared that the h5n1 virus will someday evolve a knack for airborne transmission, setting off a devastating pandemic. While the new study suggests the mutations needed are relatively few, it remains unclear whether they're likely to happen outside the laboratory. \"this certainly does not mean that h5n1 is now more likely to cause a pandemic, \" said ron fouchier, a virologist at erasmus university medical center in rotterdam, netherlands, and coauthor of the study published",

In 2011, ron fouchier and his team at erasmus medical center took the h5n1 flu virus and made it more contagious. Now the team has published another study with more details on the exact genetic changes needed to do the trick. The h5n1 bird flu is known to have sickened 650 people worldwide, and of those, 386 died. So far the virus hasn't been contagious in people. But fouchier's work, plus some similar research from another lab, showed for the first time that the virus had the potential to change in a way that would make it a real pandemic threat.

            "Health workers slaughtered chickens at a wholesale poultry market in hong kong after three dead chickens tested positive for \" bird flu \" in 2008. New research shows the h5n1 flu virus could become easily transmissible among people if it acquired just five genetic mutations. ( kin cheung / associated press ) it's a flu virus so deadly that scientists once halted research on the disease because governments feared it might be used by terrorists to stage a biological attack. Yet despite the fact that the h5n1 avian influenza has killed 60 % of the 650 humans known to be infected since it was identified in hong kong 17 years ago, the \"bird flu \" virus has yet to evolve a means of spreading easily among people. Now dutch researchers have found that the virus needs only five favorable gene mutations to become transmissible through coughing or sneezing, like regular flu viruses. World health officials have long feared that the h5n1 virus will someday evolve a knack for airborne transmission, setting off a devastating pandemic. While the new study suggests the mutations needed are relatively few, it remains unclear whether they're likely to happen outside the laboratory. \"this certainly does not mean that h5n1 is now more likely to cause a pandemic, \" said ron fouchier, a virologist at erasmus university medical center in rotterdam, netherlands, and coauthor of the study published",

In 2011, ron fouchier and his team at erasmus medical center took the h5n1 flu virus and made it more contagious. Now the team has published another study with more details on the exact genetic changes needed to do the trick. The h5n1 bird flu is known to have sickened 650 people worldwide, and of those, 386 died. So far the virus hasn't been contagious in people. But fouchier's work, plus some similar research from another lab, showed for the first time that the virus had the potential to change in a way that would make it a real pandemic threat. Only a few mutations were necessary to make the h5n1 bird flu spread through the air between ferrets, the lab stand-in for people.

Frank gnegel, head of collections at the frankfurt museum for communication, believes the telephone auctioned off as adolf hitler's personal phone is \" clearly a fake. \" the phone was made in germany, but the handset was made in england, suggesting it was assembled there, he tells german paper frankfurter allgemeine, per deutsche welle. He says he finds it very odd that the phone was painted red instead of being made from red plastic. \" everything to do with hitler was produced in a high-quality fashion; why should an engraving... Simply be painted over? \" he says. Gnegel says he finds it hard to believe that hitler had a phone with a rotary dial, \" because he was always hand-connected in the telephone exchange. \" the phone was sold for $ 243,000 earlier this month, and auction house owner bill panagopulos has rejected the \" insulting \" claims that it was a fake. In england, maj. Ranulf rayner tells the bbc he is \" extremely angry \" about the claims. He says his father, sir ralph rayner, was the first allied officer to enter hitler's bunker and was given the phone by a soviet officer. Rayner says he did his own research and was told by a former phone operator in hitler's bunker that the leader brought the phone everywhere during the last two years of the war.

None other than chipotle is second, and panera is third. Other chain restaurants — including the cheesecake factory, olive garden, and the ever-romantic buffalo wild wings — make up the rest of the top 10 on the list of 30. Of course, it stands to reason that your favorite non-chain wine bar likely wouldn't register on a national analysis. Still, \" we were surprised to see most people choosing to meet at coffee shops and casual restaurants for their first dates, \" clover ceo isaac raichyk said in press release, per bustle. According to clover, 51 % of men prefer to meet at restaurants for a first date, while 52 % of women prefer coffee shops. Raichyk says, \" we expected fine dining, bars, and nightclubs to rank much higher, but clearly people want to meet in a relaxed environment. \" ( and what's more relaxed than no. 10 on the list, applebee's? ) indeed: clover says only 18 % of men and 13 % of women prefer to meet at bars for a first date, which prompted jen carlson at gothamist to wonder: \" seriously who is using this app? it's unclear who their demographic is. Maybe they live near malls. Or rest stops, \" she writes, though she quips that she would go on a date with anybody who suggested cracker barrel, which was no. 28 on clover's list.

In a unanimous 5-0 vote today, the commission repealed a law that has been in place since 1975 to prevent cable and satellite television providers from showing games on local stations if stadium attendance is too low, the wall street journal reports. The fcc says the rule is \" outdated, \" that most teams make their money off of tv rights ( not ticket sales ), and that barely any games are blacked out anymore anyway, the new york times reports. \" the federal government should not be party to sports teams keeping their fans from viewing the games — period, \" fcc chairman tom wheeler says. Nfl blackouts — which, under the fcc rule, banned local stations from airing games if \" fewer than 85 % of seats [ had ] been sold 72 hours before kickoff \" — may still take place if the nfl and individual broadcasters agree, or if there are \" negotiating disputes \" between broadcasters and pay-tv services, politico reports. The nfl argues that by keeping the blackout rule in place, it ensures that football won't be forced to head to pay tv to make up for lost revenue from lagging ticket sales. \" the nfl is the only sports league that televises every one of its games on free, over-the-air television, \" the league says in a statement cited on espn.

If tickets to that week's game were not sold out, the national football league could keep the game off television in the local market as a way to protect gate receipts.

Is set to fight mixed martial arts star conor mcgregor in las vegas saturday night in a bout that the association of ringside physicians considers a dangerous mismatch. Floyd is 49-0 and considered the best boxer of his generation, while this will be his irish opponent's first time in a boxing ring, the new york times reports. Larry lovelace, chief of the association of more than 100 fight doctors, says he's surprised the bout was even sanctioned. \" the thing i really fear, truly fear, is that somebody's going to get really hurt in this upcoming fight, \" he says. \" it's unheard of to have a guy make his pro debut against a world champion, \" lovelace tells the los angeles times, adding that he is stunned by the decision to relax regulations and allow the fighters to wear lighter, eight-ounce gloves, making them capable of inflicting more damage on each other. Bob bennett, executive director of the nevada state athletic commission, which sanctioned the fight, disagrees. He says mcgregor is the stronger, more powerful opponent — and is 12 years younger than mayweather. Bennett says he's offended by suggestions that the commission was influenced by the fact it will receive a $ 1.2 million share of ticket sales.

He now hopes to run for team usa at the olympics, but first he has to clear a major hurdle: a lawsuit from nike. And he wants your help. The world champion in the indoor 800-meter is hoping to crowdfund what his agent calls a \" david vs. Goliath battle \" after nike sued him in may over a sponsorship agreement, per buzzfeed. Nike finished a seven-month contract with berian in december but reserved the right to match rival offers until june 28, in which case nike would emerge the victor. When new balance offered berian a three-year contract worth $ 375,000 plus bonuses, nike says it matched it. But the nike deal included clauses that would've cut his pay by up to 50 % if he didn't meet certain performance standards, reports oregonlive. Nike says such clauses are standard practice. Berian, new balance, and others in the industry disagree. The lawsuit notes berian's breach of contract \" will cause irreparable harm to nike, \" which has thus far prevented berian from signing with new balance, whose sneakers he says he prefers and has been training in. \" to force him to wear some other brand at this point would be incredibly unfair, \" says his agent, hawi keflezighi. Now the athlete is earning nothing in \" the peak of his earnings potential \" and must pay an expected $ 25,000 in legal fees when he has had only \" a little bit of income to support himself for the last several months, \" keflezighi says, writing, \" this case has a chance to be a landmark case in athlete's rights. \" support for berian is growing online using the hashtag #freeboris.

North carolinian james meyers wasn't so lucky, channel 9 reports — not only suffering the embarrassment of getting arrested for failing to return a vhs tape he took out 14 years ago, but also the shame of the movie he rented: 2001's universally panned freddy got fingered, written and directed by and starring tom green. Meyers says he was driving his daughter to school tuesday when he was pulled over for a broken taillight. After the cop ran his license, he asked meyers to step out of the car. \" i don't know how to tell you this, but there's a warrant out for your arrest from 2002, \" the cop said, per meyers. \" apparently you rented the movie freddy got fingered and never returned it. \" meyers said he thought the officer was kidding, and he was allowed to take his daughter to school by promising to clear it up at the magistrate's office the next day. But when he showed, he was handcuffed and charged with a misdemeanor for failing to return rental property, with a fine up to $ 200. Green himself heard about meyers ' plight through social media, noting he was \" struggling to believe it is real, \" and the new york daily news reports that he called meyers wednesday to offer moral, and perhaps financial, support. \" if it's 200 bucks of course i ' ll pay it for him, just for the principle of the thing, \" green tells the paper.

        "summary": "Scientists have unlocked the mystery of a special ingredient in red wine that could increase lifespan and promote health in humans. The organic compound resveratrol aids the body by jump-starting the activity of mitochondria — the power suppliers of cells, reports the daily mail. Resveratrol, which occurs naturally in red wine, is credited with combating cancer, obesity, and aging. In previous experiments, resveratrol prolonged the lifespan of mice that were fed a junk food diet. Scientists behind the current study found that the plant compound does not work without a specific gene, sirt1, and their research could lead to drugs that mimic the effects of resveratrol. That way, people don't have to become heavy drinkers to get the benefits: \" the amounts we gave to our mice would be like drinking 100 glasses of red wine a day, \" says one researcher, according to healthday.",

But, a new study finds, carrying the gene does not cause a person to be unable to lose weight. \" you can no longer blame your genes, \" says the lead researcher in a press release. \" our study shows that improving your diet and being more physically active will help you lose weight, regardless of your genetic makeup. \" researchers at england's newcastle university reviewed eight randomized studies that involved 9,563 adult subjects and found that people with the obesity gene responded \" just as well to weight loss interventions as everyone else, \" the lead researcher says. He adds, to time, \" you have to bite the bullet, and eat a bit less, or be more active [ to maintain a healthy weight ]. \" that means that, whether you're trying to lose weight via diet, exercise, or even a drug-based regimen, you can expect to see results whether you carry the gene or not. The findings held true in both men and women, younger people and older people, and people of different ethnicities, though most people involved in the studies were white. As the researchers write in the study, published tuesday in the bmj, some companies offer personalized weight loss plans based on a person's dna profile, and these findings suggest that such plans \" may not pay off, at least in the short term. \" about 16 % of the population is affected by the riskiest variant of the obesity gene, the telegraph reports; time notes that the gene is related to how the body burns calories for heat or turns calories into fat.

The new york times notes that the documents show the initial response from army commanders tasked with determining his punishment when he was freed was \" milder and more sympathetic \" than the current position, leading his lawyers to suggest political pressure has come to bear on the case. In the interview with dahl, bergdahl expressed misgivings about how he and other soldiers were sent to help retrieve a disabled armored vehicle before encountering explosives and enemy fire that turned a six-hour mission into one lasting several days. When they returned to base, an officer complained they were unshaven. He said he began to worry that a future bad order could get someone in his platoon killed.

Politico and new york lay it out: the house has sent to the senate a spending bill that would defund obamacare, but senate democrats vow to restore the health-care funding. They can do so with a simple majority vote, which cruz wouldn't be able to defeat. But he can try to prevent that vote from happening in the first place. Thus, he wants republicans to block a procedural vote on the bill next week, by filibuster if necessary. \"i hope that every senate republican will stand together and oppose cloture on the bill in order to keep the house bill intact and not let harry reid add obamacare funding back in, \" cruz says. Which means that senators who oppose obamacare would be filibustering a bill that defunds it. Even some republicans are scratching their heads: \"the notion of encouraging republican senators to vote against a bill they support doesn't seem like a very sensible strategy to me, \" says tennessee's bob corker. Meanwhile, democrats are encouraging harry reid to up the ante, reports the hill. Some such as chuck schumer not only want to restore obamacare funding but to jack up the amount of funding for the rest of the government as well. All the wrangling means that the senate might not get a bill back to the house until sept. 29, the day before the shutdown, reports the washington post. That means john boehner would have less than 24 hours to decide whether he ' ll go along.",

Eventually he looks at the recording device, drops the pipe, and \" briefly points at the camera and asks if it's on \" before the video ends. The documents also reveal that in a second video, mohamed siad, the man believed to have attempted to sell the crack video, talks about how to secretly film someone with your phone and says you might even \" catch a mayor smoking crack. \" ( yet another embarrassing video appears to show ford, decked out for st.

The twins were successfully separated last week during a dangerous, 27-hour surgery in nyc. After one week spent recovering from the surgery, cnn reports mcdonald was finally able to hold jadon for two hours. His brother, anias, has had more difficulties recovering from the surgery and isn't yet ready to be held. \" for over 13 months, i've dreamed of this moment, \" mcdonald wrote on facebook. \" i looked down at jadon's angelic face and saw him in a way i'd never seen him before. \" the twins went viral, warming the hearts of millions after cnn first reported the story of their surgery. Craniopagus twins — conjoined twins fused at the head — are extremely rare; without surgery, 80 % die before age two. But the surgery is no magic bullet: it's only been successfully performed 59 times. The mcdonald family raised the $ 100,000 needed for the surgery via a gofundme campaign, which, as of this writing, has received almost $ 300,000 in donations. With the babies safely through surgery, the family is now asking anyone who feels compelled to donate to instead send funds to a separate campaign for a child who needs a kidney transplant.",

The hunt for hitler's missing millions argues that the fuhrer had plenty of money-making schemes, the mirror reports: he copyrighted his own image, allowing him to rake in royalties from stamps sold bearing his image; was paid for public speeches; and made at least $ 1 million a year in royalties from mein kampf, thanks in part to the fact that a copy was given to all german couples on their wedding day. The documentary makers believe that hitler owed at least $ 3 million in back taxes ( in today's dollars ) by 1938 — though tax authorities were presumably a little reluctant to launch an investigation. \" hitler's actual tax records survive and suggest that he was a ' cash-in-hand ' businessman and a serial tax evader. He owed the german taxman a small fortune when he became supreme leader in 1933, \" one of the documentary makers tells the daily mail. The unpaid taxes added to a secret fortune that hitler's fortune author chris whetton, a contributor to the documentary, believes added up to more than a billion reichsmarks, or more than $ 6 billion in today's money, at its apex. Hitler \" felt paying taxes was beneath him, \" says whetton, who believes hitler's billions could still be stashed in secret accounts. ( it's not the only claim of secret nazi riches. )",

The rim of the pacific exercise, or rimpac exercise, reached a zenith in 2016, with 26 countries and 25,000 personnel involved — a record. It was china's second time participating, having first been invited in 2014, reported the diplomat at the time. This year won't mark its third time. Cnn reports the pentagon on wednesday said it has pulled china's invite as its \" behavior is inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the rimpac exercise. \" at issue: its moves in the south china sea. Amid the paracel islands there — which taiwan and vietnam have also laid claim to — sits woody island, which china deployed long-range bombers to for the first time last week. The former director of operations at the us pacific command's joint intelligence center tells cnn china was granted entry into the 2016 rimpac exercise after president xi jinping promised he wouldn't militarize the artificial islands there. The diplomat looks at what's in the cards for china and expects it to follow up with a similar move on some of the man-made spratly islands, and that has real military implications, as the h-6k bomber's range from those islands and woody island includes all of southeast asia, minus portions of myanmar and indonesia.

It turns out that new mexico's electoral votes will decide the contest, and there it's tied with one vote needing recasting - bud's.

        "summary": "Election day is just over a week away and there appears to be little chance that hillary clinton's latest email mess will be resolved before then: law enforcement sources tell the washington post that the fbi has now obtained a search warrant for a laptop used by anthony weiner, estranged husband of top clinton aide huma abedin, but determining whether it contains classified information could take weeks. Insiders say that of 650,000 emails recovered in the wiener sexting investigation, thousands are believed to be correspondence between clinton and abedin, who says she doesn't know how the emails ended up on weiner's computer. In other developments: senate minority leader harry reid says fbi director james comey may have violated a federal law that bans officials from using their position to try to sway elections, reports the wall street journai. \" i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act, \" he wrote in a letter to comey on sunday. \" through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. \" abc news reports that close to 100 former federal prosecutors and department of justice officials have written an open letter to comey criticizing his handling of the case. \" we cannot recall a prior instance where a senior justice department official — republican or democrat — has, on the eve of a major election, issued a public statement where the mere disclosure of information may impact the election's outcome, yet the official acknowledges the information to be examined may not be significant or new, \" they wrote. Politico reports on how the clinton campaign is scrambling to deal with the fallout from comey's \" october surprise. \" the campaign is trying to project an air of confidence, though aides privately admit to being a lot more nervous than they were a week ago. In a development that could spell further trouble for clinton, wikileaks announced sunday night that it's moving to phase 3 of its election coverage this week, the hill reports. The new york times reports that in brighter news for the clinton campaign, its candidate has a lead over donald trump in early voting in several swing states, which may limit damage from the email issue. At least 21 million people have already cast their ballots, including nearly a quarter of voters in florida and nevada. In his last week tonight show sunday, john oliver said the latest clinton emails had arrived in a \" disgusting \" fashion, with anthony weiner \" forcing the nation to re-litigate the entire email controversy, \" deadline reports. \" so to recap, the grinding hell of this election has thrown in yet another",

But, as techcrunch understates it, quantum computing is \" a difficult area of technology to understand, \" so you might just have to trust gil on this one. During an industry summit in washington dc on friday, ibm announced two new quantum computer systems, one that can use 50 qubits and another that uses 20 quibits. People who would know say it's a massive leap from just 18 months ago, when ibm unveiled a 5-qubit quantum computer. In fact, ibm states its new quantum computer can hold a \" quantum state \" for 90 microseconds — an obviously short amount of time but a record for quantum computing. If the above is mostly gibberish, let's take a step back. Gizmodo explains that quantum computers, which would be faster at tasks like modeling molecules and factoring numbers, work differently from normal computers. Instead of having bits that are either ones or zeroes, it has qubits that can be both at the same time. The qubits then interact with each other \" via the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics. \" ibm, google, and others are competing to build a \" useful \" quantum computer — one that gets rid of the errors inherent in quantum computing and whose \" quantum state \" never ends. Quantum computers will likely never be available for personal use, but users could access them — as they can with ibm's 20-qubit version — via the cloud.",

The announcement does not mean quantum computing is ready for common use. The system ibm has developed is still extremely finicky and challenging to use, as are those being built by others. In both the 50- and the 20-qubit systems, the quantum state is preserved for 90 microseconds — a record for the industry, but still an extremely short period of time. Nonetheless, 50 qubits is a significant landmark in progress toward practical quantum computers. Other systems built so",
            "Ibm has announced two powerful new quantum computer processors, one client-ready and another in the works. Today's announcement includes both a 20 qubit processor ready for use by its ibm q clients and an operational 50 qubit prototype currently in development. These numbers might be small in the grand scheme of what folks hope to one day do with quantum computers, but they're some of the highest in the industry to date. And progress comes fast. Advertisement \"if you look back 18 months ago, we started with 5 qubits online, \" jerry chow, manager of experimental quantum computing team at ibm told gizmodo. \"we're really going hard at it. \" a quantum computer is a completely different kind of computer. Rather than operating with bits that can only equal zeroes and ones like a regular computer, its bits, or \"qubits, \" equal zero and one at"
