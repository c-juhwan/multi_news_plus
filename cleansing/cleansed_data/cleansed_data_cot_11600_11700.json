        "summary": "Five people were attacked with acid thrown in their faces over a period of 90 minutes in london thursday night, and now two boys, ages 15 and 16, have been arrested in the attacks. In at least two of the incidents, mopeds were stolen from the victims, and in a third, a robbery was involved. Police say one of the victims suffered \" life-changing injuries, \" the bbc reports. Acid attacks are on the rise in london, with more than 1,800 reported since 2010. Cnn reports that the number of incidents went from 166 in 2014 to 261 in 2015 to 454 in 2016, and authorities say the trend is continuing this year. One victim attacked thursday was believed to be a delivery driver, and many delivery drivers are starting to refuse work in some areas over fears they ' ll be robbed. A home office minister says the government is considering putting tighter regulations on some chemicals, and one labour mp has suggested that carrying around sulphuric acid without a valid reason should be a crime. \" we could certainly come up with arrangements that would allow people to use sulphuric acid in the normal way, perhaps with the benefit of a license, \" he suggested on a bbc radio program. Until then, one official suggests retailers question youths buying things like drain cleaner, oven cleaner, ammonia, or other household chemicals that could potentially be used in such attacks. Vice reported earlier this year that while acid attacks have been reported in england since victorian times, the increase in popularity may be a result of growing crackdowns on knives and guns. Chemical weapons are technically legal, easy to find, and easy to carry hidden.",

Incumbent president hassan sheikh mohamud is standing for re-election and analysts say he is likely to be one of those who goes forward to the later rounds. Results are expected later on wednesday. The airport is viewed as the most secure site in the somali capital and voting was moved there from a police academy because of growing security concerns. Wednesday's security measures will include a ban on flights to and from mogadishu airport. Correspondents said most schools and offices remained open on tuesday but people had had to walk to reach their destination. Analysts say holding the election in the airport environment may also reduce the possibility"

That source is matthew farwell, an afghanistan veteran who reported on bergdahl for rolling stone and who yesterday reported for maxim that two soldiers who served with bergdahl told him they'd been interviewed by serial producers. Farwell also noted that at a preliminary hearing last week in bergdahl's desertion case, \" someone present at the hearing \" reported seeing koenig and \" at least one \" serial producer in court, as well as mark boal, the zero dark thirty screenwriter who's trying to get bergdahl's story into theaters. Deadline is reporting that boal and the president of his production company will serve as narrators for serial episodes focusing on bergdahl. The two soldiers farwell interviewed aren't exactly thrilled. One says, \" anyone who tries to benefit from bowe's situation has little interest in the truth, \" while the second adds, \" i get it that … serial is trying to make a nifty diorama for hipsters to marvel at … [ but ] it's the height of crassness for them to do this when it could potentially affect the legal proceedings … i assume it will be a great way to paint us as kooks and sore losers. \" a serial producer was similarly snippy in an email to the media, confirming only that show staff is currently working on \" season 2, season 3, and some other podcast projects, \" adding, \" we'd very much appreciate if fellow journalists would give us some room and not feel the need to … try to figure out what you think we might be doing … having a bunch of wild speculation out there makes our job reporting harder.

        "summary": "In his book outliers, malcolm gladwell popularized the notion that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become great at something. Portland's dan mclaughlin is testing the theory in a remarkable way: the 31-year-old quit his job in june 2009 and devoted himself to practicing golf six hours a day, six days a week, for six years, reports the st. Petersburg times. Mclaughlin had never golfed before the experiment began, but his goal is to turn pro at the end of the dan plan. Mclaughlin, now 1,400 hours in, got nike to supply clubs and convinced an expert coach to take him on. The times explains the strategy: \" he couldn't putt from 3 feet until he was good enough at putting from 1 foot. He couldn't putt from 5 feet until he was good enough putting from 3 feet. He's working away from the hole. He didn't get off the green for five months, \" writes michael kruse. \" everybody asks him what he shoots for a round. He has no idea. His next drive will be his first. \" if he finishes the 10,000 hours and doesn't make the pga cut, mclaughlin sounds like he ' ll be ok: \" i don't think it can fail, because it's not really about me or what ultimately happens with me. It's about blazing a new path and kind of trying to change the way people see life's possibilities. \"",

Some 80 % of super bowl ads don't help sales at all, says a study reported by adage. Non-super bowl commercials, on the other hand, do better: only 60 % fail to increase sales. The study by research firm communicus was based on pre- and post-game interviews with 1,000 people who watched the 2012 and 2013 games. ( what fared well in 2013: budweiser's \" brotherhood \" ad. What didn't: tide's \" miracle stain \" ad. ) super bowl ads are, researchers note, better-remembered than your typical commercial: some 44 % recall having seen game ads versus 32 % who recall regular ads. Trouble is, while viewers may remember the ad's storyline, only 35 % tend to remember the brand involved. In non-game ads, the figure is about 50 %. Two possible issues at play, per communicus ' ceo: in many cases, the ads make a big game debut but then largely disappear from the air, and \" one ad exposure often isn't enough to make anything happen. \" second, \" the advertisers really dial up the entertainment quotient \" in hopes of making best-of lists, and the brand association can suffer \" just because of the way the creative is structured. \" ( another million-dollar question: will this year's half-time act be memorable? )",

        "summary": "Daniel radcliffe talks harry potter, being short, and some slightly less-sfw topics in an endlessly entertaining playboy interview. Our favorite quotes: on whether being short limits his roles: \" ' can you play a really f --- ing tall person? ' no, obviously not. Can i play a black guy? for similar reasons, no. I couldn't play something i wouldn't take myself seriously in. I wouldn't be able to take myself seriously as the quarterback in a football movie, which is my one legitimate gripe. I would love to be in a football movie. The only part i would get is the general manager. \" on meeting his girlfriend while filming a movie in which her character gives his character a blow job: \" that's a wonderful record of us flirting for the first time. There's no acting going on — not from my end, anyway. There's a moment when she makes me laugh, and i ' m laughing as me and not as my character. I knew i was in trouble. \" on whether he \" fluffed \" while doing equus on broadway, which required him to be naked much of the time: \" dude, there was no opportunity for fluffing. I was onstage for the entire show, and i ran around naked for 10 minutes in a scene that's about sexual failure and horse blinding. \" on whether he masturbated while filming the harry potter movies: \" yeah, i was like every other teenager in that sense.... But not when i was on set. I wasn't going, when is alan rickman going to nail this scene so i can run back to my trailer? \" on why he doesn't want to get into detail about his wilder drinking days: \" i was forthright about it, but once you start talking about this, that's all you talk about. I can say lots of well-meaning stuff — why it happened and how i stopped — for three hours, and the headline would be drunk on the set of harry potter. \" the full interview is worth a read.

            "Q3 why hasn't the appeal faded? because the stories are great! a huge part of our culture now is that if something becomes successful there's a backlash. Harry potter didn't have that. There are people who don't want to read it, but the number of people who actively dislike it is very low. The books are great, and they came along at the perfect moment, when there was a fear, because of the rise of computer games, that reading was going to become a thing of the past. When kids suddenly found these books, it was something everyone could get behind as a global populace. Q4 you've been very forthright about the fact that you drank heavily between the ages of 18 and 20. Was that a reaction to public scrutiny? anytime i'd go out to dance, camera phones would come out. That would make me very self-conscious, and what's the easiest way to escape being self-conscious? alcohol is a quick way of doing that. So it was related in that way.

Hours before one shop was due to close, a group of deaf patrons who met there regularly were told they had to move to a different section; the area was due to be cleaned, employees said, per the suit. But when the customers complied, \" the starbucks employees proceeded to allow non-deaf customers into that area and did not clean the area, \" the suit says, via courthouse news service. Several of the deaf customers were also refused service, they say. At the same location several months later, employees allegedly called police, citing a disturbance by the customers — but the cops saw no indication that the claim was true. When the patrons wrote to company execs about the incident, they were offered a gift card, but they say the company didn't investigate. According to the complaint, another deaf customer was laughed at and told \" he sounded funny. \" the customer asked to speak to the manager, prompting the employee to curse at him before multiple workers told him to leave.

Zuckerberg goes on: \" we view it as our role in the",
            "In 2004 everyone freaked out when gmail launched because google would be reading your emails to figure out what ads to serve you. \"privacy advocates objected to the advertising model, which involves google's robot eyes scanning every e-mail for keywords and displaying contextual advertisements alongside a user's inbox, \" noted wired. That might sound familiar to your great-great-great grandparents. Supposedly many people were apprehensive about using telephones in the early 1900s because they knew the phone companies could listen in on their phone calls. There are people who won't use phones today because of the ease in which calls can be tapped. But the rest of us seem to be ok with gmail. And our phone. That's because the benefits of those products far outweigh the privacy costs. And people are going to be just fine with facebook, too. Even if they did do a switcharoo on privacy settings a month ago that is still reverberating through the tech press. Contrary to published reports, facebook ceo mark zuckerberg did not say \"the age of privacy is over \" in my interview with him last friday evening at the crunchies.

Napoli knocked a double off him, scoring what would be the two winning runs. But what happened next was even weirder — la russa brought in lance lynn, had lynn issue an intentional walk, and then immediately replaced him with jason motte, mlb.com reports. Was this some bizarre tactical error? no, la russa explained afterward — it was a communication breakdown. When la russa first called the bullpen, he'd told the coach to have rzepcynski and motte warm up, he explained. But thanks to the rowdy rangers crowd, the bullpen coach only heard rzepcynski's name, so when napoli came up, there was no one ready to replace the lefthander. When la russa realized that motte wasn't throwing he called the bullpen again, but this time the coach thought he'd asked for lynn — who was supposed to be unavailable after throwing 47 pitches in game 3. La russa didn't realize until lynn jogged in to the game. \"i went, 'oh, what are you doing here? ' \" he says. ( click for 10 reasons why the rangers will finish off the cardinals in game 6. )",

The u.s. Now imports 45 % of its petroleum, down from 57 % in 2008, and is on track to meet obama's long-term goal, the administration maintains.imports have fallen, in part, because the united states has increased domestic oil and gas production in recent years.u.s.

A new meta-analysis examined more than 90 memory experiments carried out on 25 species encompassing birds, mammals, and bees. Researchers at stockholm university and brooklyn college found that for dogs, events are forgotten after about two minutes — and that's on the long end of the spectrum. The average memory duration for all animals studied is 27 seconds, with chimps ' memory as short as 20 seconds; that's a length of time that rats beat, reports national geographic. Humans subjected to similar studies have had no problem remembering a sample stimulus they had seen as many as two days prior. In fact, based on these findings, \" we think humans ' ability to remember arbitrary events is unique, \" one researcher says. Animals ' memories can be broken into two categories — short-term and longer-term \" specialized \" memories, reports the university of stockholm. And while animals can have excellent specialized memories ( think birds remembering the exact locations of previous nests ), memories of specific events tend to disappear in a span \" ranging from a few seconds to several minutes, \" per the researchers ' findings, published in december in behavioural processes. That said, one researcher not involved in the study pointed out that some animals have shown the ability to capture episodic memories the way humans can — great apes have been shown to do so for days, if not years — while another cautioned that \" it might be too early to argue that humans are the only ones who are able to mentally travel back and forward in time. \" ( dolphins, meanwhile, can recall whistles 20 years later. )",

Aron then took the child to his apartment, at 466 east 2nd st., where he killed him, hacked his body into several parts and kept his feet in the freezer. Leiby's heartbroken parents, nachman and esther kletzky, stayed away from the sentencing.

            "Brooklyn butcher levi aron was sentenced today to 40 years to life in prison for murdering and dismembering an 8-year old boy, ending a gruesome chapter to one of the city's most horrible crimes. Aron showed little emotion as a brooklyn supreme court judge neil firetog pronounced the sentence, the result of plea deal cut three weeks earlier. During that guilty plea, aron, 36, admitted that he abducted the lost boy, leiby kletzky, last summer, then smothered him and chopped up his body amid an intense search for the boy, who missed a turn on his way home from day camp. Aron abducted kletzky july 11, 2011 at 18th avenue and dahill road, in brooklyn. Aron then took the child to his apartment, at 466 east 2nd st., where he killed him, hacked his body into several parts and kept his feet in the freezer. Leiby's heartbroken parents, nachman and esther kletzky, stayed away from the sentencing. They let the statement that they issued after aron's guilty plea speak for itself. \"they feel that justice has been done, \" said assemblyman dov hikind, a family friend. \"\"every time the story appears, it brings them back to the day it happened. \" \"it's incredibly painful, incredibly difficult, so hopefully now the spotlight will move",

That seems to be the strategy behind hillary clinton's announcement yesterday that she opposed the keystone xl pipeline, writes philip bump for the washington post, asserting that clinton may have purposely timed her anti-pipeline statements to lure liberal democrats who've been more amenable to competitor bernie sanders, per cnn/orc polling — even if those dems may not be the ones to push her over the top in november 2016. \" the politics explain themselves, \" bump writes. \" clinton is now willing to make her november case slightly more difficult if she can make her spring fight easier. \" according to a gallup poll cited by the post, while only 67 % of moderate and conservative democrats believe global warming is caused by human activity, a more substantial number — 81 % — of liberal democrats think that's the case. And because of environmental concerns swirling around the pipeline, it may make political sense for clinton to bring that up now to pull liberal democrats in — even though polls from late last year and earlier this year show that support among americans overall for the keystone project is strong, bump notes. And sanders knows what's the what, he adds, welcoming her to the opposition party yesterday in a tweet. \" clinton is late to the party on keystone, but she's clearly interested in being where the party is, \" bump writes.

At rest, the participants'saliva, which helps protect teeth, was the same in terms of volume and chemical makeup. But things began to change as the athletes started working out: saliva production dropped. This means their mouths got drier, explains the new york times, and it happened even if they were consuming liquids. Further, \" saliva ph increased significantly, \" per the study, which the times reports may encourage tartar plaque growth. But don't hang up the sneakers. Frese notes that the study was a small one, and that the athletes it studied were pretty intense: their mean weekly exercise time was nine hours.

Makeup artist demi wright started feeling pain in her side last november. When she went to the doctor, they admitted her to a maternity ward due to the presence of hormones similar to those in pregnant women, according to the gazette-news. What wright actually had was a molar pregnancy. As an expert explains to huffpo: \" initially, a molar pregnancy acts in the same way as a conventional pregnancy, tests are positive due to the release of the hdg hormone and there is a growth in the uterus. It is only when the patient comes for their 12-week scan that a molar pregnancy is detected. \" doctors found the tumor, discovered their mistake, and transferred wright out of the maternity ward. She died three weeks after being diagnosed with terminal adenocarcinoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer that had spread throughout her body. Molar pregnancies only rarely turn into cancer, and it seems wright was one of the unlucky few. Her family says they are \" devastated \" to lose the woman they remember as \" bubbly, positive, and cheerful. \" \" when we found out the cancer was terminal … she gave me a big hug and said: ' it's going to be ok, ' \" her father tells the gazette-news. \" the next day, she passed away. \" a fundraising page set up in wright's memory is currently raising money for cancer research.

The majority of people who reach that mark are women, notes omaha.com. As for that inevitable question about the secret to his longevity, behrends has a pretty good answer: beer. \"he always told everybody the reason he has lived so long is drinking one can of beer, every day at 3pm, \" says daughter lois. He favors miller but would be happy with \" whatever kind was around. \" behrends is nebraska's oldest living resident and quite possibly the oldest man in the nation, notes the website. That part's a little unclear, however, because a california man claims to be 116 and an illinois man 112, though their age records, unlike those of behrends, cannot be verified by the national gerontology research group. Behrends lived his first 60 years on a farm, raising seven kids with wife irene, before moving to the city, reports the lincoln journal star.

The sobering statistic and emotionally devastating nature of the disease make it understandable why no doctor relishes having to tell his patients that they've been stricken with it, but some doctors just aren't dealing with that conversation at all. A report out this week from the association reveals that while 90 % of medicare patients with cancer received news of their diagnosis from their doctors, only 45 % of those with alzheimer's received the same courtesy. \" these disturbingly low disclosure rates in alzheimer's disease are reminiscent of rates seen for cancer in the 1950s and ' 60s, when even mention of the word ' cancer ' was taboo, \" an alzheimer's association vp says in a press release. Researchers say that physicians are often reluctant to deliver such a life-altering diagnosis during what's often a short office visit. \" it's difficult to disclose a diagnosis of a fatal brain disease in just a few minutes, \" an association director tells npr. Doctors also don't want to upset their patients with what's unquestionably an uneasy conversation. \" i ' m sure that i squirmed, \" says one in describing his first diagnosis discussion to npr. But the report indicates \" few patients become depressed or have other long-term emotional problems because of the diagnosis \" and notes it's crucial patients be told early on ( the report also found that diagnosis-disclosure rates went up as the disease advanced ).

Things have been tense between arnold and burnett ever since arnold's allegation that there are tapes from donald trump's show the apprentice, of which burnett was an executive producer, that prove trump is a bigot. That includes an alleged recording of trump saying the n-word, which former white house adviser omarosa manigault newman also says exists. Burnett's wife, touched by an angel actress roma downey, also weighed in with her own tweet. \" got this bruise tonight when tom arnold tried to ambush my husband mark and me at a charity event, \" she wrote, showing a pic of what appeared to be the black-and-blue top of her hand. \" is your tv show worth it tom? please stop. \" to which arnold replied: \" bulls ---.

The secretary of state, whose air force flight was not affected by the commercial ban brought in after a rocket hit a house near the airport, plans to meet with israeli pm benjamin netanyahu, palestinian president mahmoud abbas, and other local leaders, reports the washington post. In other news: the israel airports authority says the suspension of flights by american and european carriers has left thousands of israelis stranded around the world and thousands of visitors stuck in israel. Authorities say another airport in the country's southern region will be opened. The flight ban is a serious blow to israel's economy, and netanyahu asked kerry last night to try to overturn it, reports the guardian. A white house official, however, says, \" we're not going to overrule the faa.

        "summary": "There's been a shakeup of power in saudi arabia: in several royal decrees announced today, king salman replaced his heir, as well as the world's longest serving foreign minister, reuters reports. Salman's nephew interior minister mohammed bin nayef, 55, has been named crown prince — next in line for the throne — replacing salman's half-brother muqrin bin abdulaziz. Bin nayef has the closest ties to us officials of any in the saudi royal family and is the first of his generation to be named as heir, reuters and the new york times report. Replacing foreign minister saud al-faisal, king salman named former us ambassador and non-royal adel al-jubeir in his place. Faisal is 75, and the decree cited \" health conditions \"; muqrin is 69, and the decree said he requested retirement. The saudi king also moved his son, mohammed bin salman, 30, to the role of deputy crown prince, or second in line to the throne, notes the ap. Though young, bin salman is respected throughout the royal family for his tough response to al-qaeda attacks in saudi arabia and for his background in foreign policy after just four months as defense minister. Previously, he had little interaction with the public. The changes show the 79-year-old king is carving his own path, rather than following that of his predecessor, king abdullah, but are unlikely to result in any major alterations in policy.

        "summary": "Fifteen-year-olds can no longer get married in missouri. The state had long been the most lenient in the us when it came to child marriage: about half the states have no minimum age requirement for marriage, but missouri was the only state in which just one parent's signature — and no approval from a judge — was needed for a 15-year-old to wed, the kansas city star reported in march. Because of that, the state had become a sort of \" destination wedding \" venue for 15-year-old brides, the star reported, many of whom crossed the border to marry their alleged rapists in an attempt to avoid statutory rape charges against older boyfriends. Not so anymore: the star reports that gov. Mike parson on friday signed a law making 16 the minimum legal age to marry in the state. The law, which still requires one parent's signature in order for 16- or 17-year-olds to marry, also bars anyone age 21 or older from being given a marriage license if they are planning to marry someone younger than than 17, per the bill. \" the welfare of our children must always be a top priority, \" parson said in a statement. Lawmakers have been working for years to change the child marriage laws in missouri; the bill that was ultimately signed into law passed the state senate 32-1 and the state house 135-3. Other states are taking similar measures; delaware was the first state to ban child marriage entirely, making 18 the minimum legal age for marriage, with no exceptions, in may. New jersey did the same in june. Virginia and texas also have 18 set as the minimum age, but they allow exceptions for legally emancipated minors.",

            "In the dark before sunrise, high school sophomore brittany koerselman, belly bulging, seven months pregnant and feeling like a cow, tucked herself into the borrowed white prom dress that would be her wedding gown. The iowa teen didn't want to be a child bride. But the cops were coming. She was 15, not even old enough to drive on her own. Jeremie rook, her boyfriend and the father of her baby, was 21. It didn't matter how \"infatuatedly in love \" she was then with everything about jeremie — his long chocolate hair, his bad-boy attitude, tongue stud and 28 tattoos. In iowa, a 21-year-old having sex with a 15-year-old is statutory rape. The evidence was alive in her womb. Digital access for only $ 0.99 for the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. \"i never wanted to get married, ever, like in my life, \" brittany recalled recently. \"but i did it anyway, because it was either that or he go to prison, like, forever. \" so on a cold morning in march 2014, she piled into a car with her family and sped south for six hours and 400 miles from little rock, iowa, near the minnesota border, to get to the one state that possesses the most lenient law in the nation allowing 15-year-olds to wed: missouri. More than 1,000 children the same age as brittany have married in the state since 1999. No place in the united states is easier, the star found in an analysis of child marriage statutes across the country. Every other state requires some combination of a judge's order, parents ' permission, premarital counseling or proof of pregnancy. Some flat-out prohibit marriages so young. But in missouri, brides and grooms as young as 15 can"

What's more, unlike chemo, it seems to do so without side effects. Researchers at st.

Metastatic means the disease has progressed beyond the pancreas to other parts of the body, which usually results in quick death, explains the guardian. In this trial, those who received a standard chemo drug generally survived 4.4 months, while those who received imm-101 as well lived for seven months — with some living more than a year and one for about three years. \" to me it's really exciting, \" says the hospital's angus dalgleish. \" this is the first time we have got an immunotherapy that is a really good candidate to help control pancreatic cancer, which is one of the biggest killing diseases. \" the drug essentially wakes up the immune system around cancer cells that was shut off by the cancer, and the researchers say it holds promise for other types of cancer as well. However, in this case, it seemed to help only those with metastatic pancreatic cancer, not those whose disease hadn't spread.

But conservationists and their supporters are fuming at the plan: last weekend saw a gathering of 4,500 in perth to protest. \" what they are doing is illegal and violates 15 different united nations conventions and treaties, \" notes one activist. It could also hurt other species; in fact, the \" bycatch \" of drum lining, as the practice is called, is five times the target catch, meaning dolphins, whales, turtles, and other species could be killed. Also controversial: the approach targets the endangered great white shark. There's also concern among scuba divers that the plan could backfire, the guardian notes: the bait could encourage sharks to come closer to shore, they say. Officials are standing firm: \" while we understand this policy will be divisive and cause anxiety for some in the community, it is clear that the number of fatalities in recent years required a stronger response. \"",

When he protested, a dmv worker \" told me that i had to send in some documentation or religious text to show why it was required for me to have my horns on, \" says moonsong, who said the requirement seemed \" onerous. \" nevertheless, he wrote an essay and sent along scholarly works, including one: \" pagan religions: a handbook for diversity training. \" he waited, then says he informed the dmv he and the aclu were talking; days later, his id arrived. Moonsong is certainly not the first to fight for his right to wear religious headgear; the post notes that some 30 states have strong religious attire laws on the books. But \" even in states without a high level of protection, officials have to have a pretty good reason for saying no to a religious accommodation for a driver's license photo, \" says an official with the religious freedom center of the newseum institute. Maine law states that headgear is fine, notes the bangor daily news, as long as it \" does not present as an obstruction or present a shadow and render the portrait inadequate for the identification of the cardholder. \" as for moonsong, he seems pretty happy with the outcome. \" many practicing pagans are afraid of being public, \" he says, \" but when they see my horns it reminds them it's ok to be yourself. \"",

One got a year of home confinement, the other six months of weekends in jail. One to come: a former educator who was convicted but just had a baby will be sentenced in august. Appeals: the eight who chose not to plead guilty have 30 days to appeal, and they can remain free on bond in the interim. Unsympathetic judge: \"everyone starts crying about these educators. There were thousands of children harmed in this thing. This is not a victimless crime. \" the judge had the leeway to impose so much prison time because the convictions fell under the anti-racketeering rico law.

But a coast guard officer had a decidedly different experience in this town nestled in the aleutian islands when a leisurely hike turned into a blitz against him by a bald eagle, the bristol bay times reports. Lt. Andres ayure had come to the area from san francisco just a few days earlier, and he decided to explore the local terrain on his day off by trekking up the perhaps appropriately named ballyhoo mountain. The hike up was uneventful, but as ayure descended, a bird of prey emerged and took swipes at him three times. On the fourth swoop, the big bird tore a hole in ayure's hoodie ( coincidentally, an american eagle-branded sweatshirt ) and launched a half-dozen or so more offensives against the lieutenant before technology saved the day: ayure's cellphone fell out of his pocket. The eagle apparently got distracted by its shiny new toy, nabbing the phone while ayure dashed down the slope. \" it was crazy, \" says ayure, whose phone appears to be gone for good. The times notes that unalaska's dutch harbor, as the country's busiest fishing port, is teeming with bald eagles known to menace residents by hovering near garbage bins, streetlights, and even city hall.

In a study involving rats, the lower levels of oxygen in the higher-altitude region seem to hit females hardest, which may not be a fluke given they have lower levels of serotonin — a brain chemical linked to happiness — and thus may be less equipped to deal with the hypoxic conditions. \" the significance of this animal study is that it can isolate hypoxia as a distinct risk factor for depression in those living at altitude or with other chronic hypoxic conditions such as copd, asthma, or smoking, independent of other risk factors, \" the lead author says in a university of utah press release. Another researcher tells livescience that the findings, which don't necessarily translate to humans, beg the question of whether women might need to be treated for depression differently than they are today. The team is already at work on a new study to determine whether antidepressants might be more effective if serotonin levels in depressed women are increased to levels found in women at lower altitudes.

The eight intermountain states of the american west, sometimes called the suicide belt, have high elevations and the associated thin air. Now, researchers say the low oxygen in these areas is linked with signs of depression, and could potentially even contribute to suicides in some regions. In 2012, colorado, wyoming, utah, montana, idaho, nevada, arizona and new mexico all had suicide rates exceeding 18 per 100,000 people, while the national rate was 12.5 per 100,000 people, according to the american foundation for suicide prevention. These states tend toward higher elevations, and several studies have identified living at higher elevations as an independent risk factor for suicide. Other studies have also found that rates of depression increase with elevation and may contribute to increased suicide risk. In the new study, researchers at the university of utah and one colleague at tufts university found that female rats exposed to high-elevation conditions — both simulated and real — exhibited increased depressionlike behavior. The behavior could have been due to the animals experiencing hypoxia, a condition in which an individual gets insufficient oxygen, the researchers said. [ 5 myths about suicide, debunked ] male rats showed no increased signs of depression when exposed to the same levels of hypoxia, the researchers found. Female mammals, including humans and rats, naturally produce less of the brain chemical serotonin than males.

Police say that a good samaritan who found a toddler roaming around a central florida park this weekend got quite the surprise from the girl's father: a beating. Nbc affiliate wfla-tv reports that the man found the 2-year-old girl saturday inside a lakeland park. He noticed the child had gotten separated from her parents and, according to lakeland police, asked the child where her parents were."

All the retrieved items save those that needed attention from texas a&m's underwater conservation lab spent the following decade-plus in the smithsonian's custody, on loan from the state of hawaii. No more: four crates were sent to the kauai museum last month, and another two or three are to be delivered. The ap notes the items are the only confirmed objects from kamehameha ii's \" short but intense reign, \" which ran from 1819-1824. He purchased the ship in 1820; it had been built four years prior in salem, mass., for $ 100,000 at a time when comparable ships were built for $ 4,000 or $ 5,000. Half that staggering sum was spent on construction and the other half on exotic wood and furniture, a smithsonian historian told the chicago tribune, adding \" this was so unusual for the period that up to 2,600 people a day came to see her in 1816. \"",

Heather meadows, 29, who has a 6-year-old and a newborn, was rushed to a hialeah er from encore plastic surgery and pronounced dead after experiencing medical complications. Cbs miami reports meadows was having a \" brazilian butt lift \" done at encore; the procedure begins with a liposuction, with the removed fat then injected into the buttocks. The miami-dade medical examiner says death was caused by fat clots in the arteries of her lungs and heart. When the fat was injected, it probably was introduced to her bloodstream via a vein, reports the miami herald. Per the new york daily news, although there aren't any active complaints against encore, two doctors listed as working there, orlando llorente and james mcadoo, are also tied to a practice called vanity cosmetic surgery, where a 51-year-old woman died in 2013 after a breast augmentation. A third doctor listed in yelp reviews for encore has been deemed \" an immediate serious danger \" to public health by state health officials and banned from performing lipo and fat transfers to the buttocks after four patients were reportedly badly injured as he performed those procedures. A woman set to have surgery at encore and standing outside its hialeah office tells wsvn, \" i ' m not having surgery here. Are you kidding me? this is a chop shop. \" the station says she got her $ 4,000 back, while nbc miami notes she said it could have cost up to $ 12,000 at another practice.

        "summary": "President trump raised the stakes in the immigration debate on wednesday with his support of a radically new system that would favor immigrants with job skills and fluency in english over those with family ties. Unlike trump's previous emphasis on reducing illegal immigration, this plan would focus on reducing legal immigration, by a lot. The white house says it would be similar to the merit-based systems used by australia and canada. Details and coverage: the bill: trump's plan is based on a bill introduced in the senate by david perdue of georgia and tom cotton of arkansas. It's called the reforming american immigration for strong employment act, or raise, and the legislation is here. They introduced it in february and it hasn't gone anywhere since. The reductions: about 1 million people are currently granted legal residency each year, and this merit-based system would cut that by 41 % in its first year and 50 % in its 10th, per the ap. Points system: the new york times takes a look at how the australian system works. Would-be immigrants receive the most points, up to 60, for having needed skills; they get fewer points, up to 20, for fluency in english. They also get points based on age, with those 25 to 32 receiving the most. The idea is to bring in people able to support themselves, though one critic says the system is \" full of holes. \" canada has a similar system, though its version also aims to promote a multicultural society. The times had a separate story on canada's system in march. Of note: both nations let in a greater number of immigrants per capita than the us does. Economists say no: the washington post reports that most economists — 16 of 18 in its july survey — think it's a foolish idea to cut immigration because it will hurt economic growth and raise the risk of recession. \" we need to modernize the immigration system, but cutting immigration in half is bad for the economy and bad policy, \" says jeremy robbins of new american economy, a coalition founded by michael bloomberg. Opposition: the white house support will give the bill new life, but its prospects still aren't good because not only democrats oppose it. Gop sen. Lindsey graham, for instance, said it would devastate south carolina's tourism industry by reducing the number of low-wage workers at hotels and restaurants, per the post and courier. Among democrats, dianne feinstein says it would \" cripple \" the agriculture industry, per the hill. In favor: a post at the conservative power line",

        "summary": "Al-jazeera has obtained a leaked copy of the 337-page report from the abbottabad commission, which was formed by the pakistani government in june 2011 to investigate the raid on osama bin laden's compound by us forces. More than 200 witnesses, including bin laden family members and high-level officials, were interviewed, but the government never released the report despite urging from the commission to do so. The bottom line of the report: government incompetence and intelligence failures ( as opposed to complicity ) allowed bin laden to live in six different pakistan locations over nine years. The scathing report also warns that the us could be allowed to carry out a similar raid if pakistan doesn't update its defense strategy. The report also offers details of bin laden's life on the lam from the time he entered pakistan in mid-2002: bin laden reportedly met with khalid sheikh mohammed in 2003, a month before mohammed was captured. Pakistan was no longer actively looking for bin laden by 2005. A family car with bin laden inside was once stopped for speeding, in a close call for bin laden. At one of his houses, the men would travel as far as 93 miles away to make phone calls. Bin laden and his family lived frugally; the al-qaeda leader had just six outfits, one jacket, two sweaters... And a cowboy hat. If bin laden was feeling lethargic ( he suffered from kidney and possibly heart problems ), he would eat chocolate or an apple. He oversaw his grandchildren's playtime, including gardening competitions. When the us raid began, one of bin laden's daughters threw herself at a soldier who was aiming his weapon at bin laden. She was later asked to identify her father's body. More details on bin laden's family life here; more details on the raid here. Full report here. Also revealed today: how the us kept the bin laden raid records secret.",

Some 400 miles away, the news is bringing relief to one family, reports the washington post. The portland press herald has the \" ironic \" story of douglas parkhurst, who was at the babe ruth baseball game his grandson was participating in and was killed by the car driven by carol sharrow, 51. Parkhurst himself confessed to a deadly hit-and-run in 2013, bringing some answers but little solace to the family of carolee ashby, a 4-year-old killed on oct. 31, 1968, as she walked to a store in fulton, new york, with her then 15-year-old sister to buy birthday candles for the teenager's cake. Though police initially eyed parkhurst as a suspect, a 2012 tip to police was what ended up spurring parkhurst's confession. That confession reportedly came only after parkhurst received assurances from prosecutors that the statute of limitations had passed and he would not be prosecuted. Darlene ashby mccann, the sister who was with carolee when she was killed, says her family never received an apology from parkhurst. Still, \" now i am relieved, \" she says. \" i truly am. The same thing that happened to my sister happened to him. It made a complete circle. \" the bangor daily news reports that while police did not state whether they believe alcohol was a factor, sharrow does have at least one drunken driving conviction and a second previous drunken driving charge. Police have uncovered no connection between sharrow and parkhurst, who was reportedly trying to close a gate on the field to prevent sharrow from fleeing the scene when he was hit. He died en route to the hospital.",

Google, the world's no.1 internet search engine, has its headquarters four miles away from mountain view's moffett field, which is managed by nasa ames. The report comes as google and other internet companies face criticism for what some see as abusing their hometown's infrastructure and public works. On monday, protesters in san francisco temporarily blocked a private google bus that ferries employees to company headquarters. The protesters charged that the private commuter buses clog up municipal bus stops, which they use for free. ( read more: protesters form human blockade around google bus ) according to the nasa report, the aviation fuel provider at moffett field believed that h211 was performing only nasa-related flights and therefore sold all fuel to the company at the rate reserved for defense department entities. Non-defense department entities are charged a higher rate, although the rate does not include any state or local taxes.

His lawyer, sophie david, describes 26-year-old moroccan ayoub el khazzani as a hungry man planning to rob people for food money, reuters reports. \" ( i saw ) somebody who was very sick, somebody very weakened physically, as if he suffered from malnutrition, very, very thin and very haggard, \" david says. \" he is dumbfounded by the terrorist motives attributed to his action. \" she says khazzani found his weapon, an ak-47, in a brussels park where he often slept. \" a few days later he decided to get on a train that some other homeless people told him would be full of wealthy people traveling from amsterdam to paris and he hoped to feed himself by armed robbery, \" says david. David adds that khazzani thought his gun had jammed before he got off a shot in the train melee. But french interior minister bernard cazeneuve says \" several shots \" went off, and the telegraph reports that franco-american professor mark moogalian, 51, was shot in the neck after he grabbed khazzani's ak-47 and the assailant fired another gun at him. As for alleged terrorism, cazeneuve says spanish authorities linked him to \" the radical islamist movement, \" and security officials say he traveled to turkey and syria earlier this year — which khazzani denies through his lawyer, the bbc reports. Others say khazzani had been arrested for drug trafficking at least once. \" he was an ordinary young man, he played football, went fishing, he worked to make a living, \" says a muslim figure in the spanish port of algeciras, where khazzani lived.",
