        "summary": "Japan has been stunned and sickened by what the guardian reports is the country's biggest mass killing since world war ii: the murder of 19 people at a center for the disabled just outside tokyo. Satoshi uematsu, a 26-year-old former administrator at the tsukui yamayuri-en facility in sagamihara, surrendered at a police station after the tuesday morning rampage, in which victims with ages ranging from 19 to 70 were stabbed to death and another 26 people were injured, the bbc reports. The kyodo news agency says uematsu wrote to the speaker of japan's house of representatives in february, threatening to \" obliterate 470 disabled people \" during a night shift at the facility, which cared for people with a range of mental and physical disabilities, reports reuters. \" my goal is a world in which the severely disabled can be euthanized, with their guardians ' consent, if they are unable to live at home and be active in society, \" wrote uematsu, who allegedly attacked his victims as they slept after he broke into the center at around 2: 10am. Kyodo says that in the letter, uematsu also claimed killing the disabled would help the world economy and prevent world war iii, the ap notes. Authorities say uematsu was committed to a mental hospital after sending the letter and telling colleagues that he wanted to harm disabled people, but was released on march 2 after doctors decided he had improved. The washington post reports that an hour before the attacks, uematsu tweeted what is believed to be a photo of himself, with the message: \" wishing for world peace. Beautiful japan!!!!!! \"",

        "summary": "Battle of the sexes takes viewers back to 1973 and the houston astrodome, the setting of the famous exhibition tennis match between feminist icon billie jean king ( emma stone ), then 29, and chauvinist bobby riggs ( steve carell ), then 55. As viewers learn, the game wasn't the only thing at stake for king. Here's what critics are saying: battle of the sexes is not only \" almost remedial in its timeliness, given last year's political grudge match, \" but it's \" warm, earnestly entertaining \" and \" a pleasure to watch, \" writes ann hornaday at washington post. Directors valerie faris and jonathan dayton bring the 1970s to life \" with verve and humor, \" helped by \" gifted comic actors in supporting turns that crackle with winking good fun, \" she adds. Sarah silverman, in particular, stands out. Stone plays king as \" an undauntable renegade \" in public but \" racked with self-doubt \" in private, while carell's chauvinistic riggs is \" more clownish than offensive, \" writes leah greenblatt at entertainment weekly. The pair hardly ever meet except for their famous match, which doesn't really wow. But that \" hardly matters, \" writes greenblatt. \" the symbolic power of what happened there — one small step, one giant leap for womankind — is still the movie's truest ace. \" supporting actors silverman and alan cumming \" steal every scene they're in. \" but it's carell who brings his \" a game \" so that riggs emerges as \" marginally, the more poignant character, \" according to john anderson at the wall street journal. \" carell is both a bona-fide movie star and a marvelous actor, two things that don't always go together \" and \" watching him play the bratty riggs evokes something very close to love, \" he writes. Inkoo kang at the wrap agrees carell shines, but she attributes this to \" the meekness of the characterization of king. Hardly anywhere in sight is the ambition and hyper-competitiveness that it takes to become a record-breaking champion. \" but though \" subtle, \" stone's performance is still \" compelling, \" and the film is \" handsome and moving \" and \" full of smart complexities \" that should make it \" a serious awards contender, \" kang writes.",

I refuse to be chained to any particular party, \" adding to the redding record searchlight: \" i refuse to stay on anyone's plantations. \" he explains to the record searchlight that \" i don't like the racist policies of hillary clinton; i think bernie sanders has a good message, but he fails in his execution; and i don't know anything about donald trump. \" cheadle reiterates that even though his mind hasn't been made up about where his vote will be cast, he still wasn't offended by trump's rally remarks. \" he had been speaking positively about black people prior to that statement, \" he tells npr. \" everybody was happy. It was a jovial thing. \" he parses trump's word choice as well, noting that trump could've avoided the \" ambiguity \" of his phrasing had he simply said \" my african-american friend \" or \" supporter \" — though he adds that had trump followed up his statement with \" ' what's up, dawg ' or ' boy ' or even the n-word as they use it today, i really would have been offended. \"",

The connecticut senator, who cited the sandy hook massacre when he launched the filibuster wednesday morning, called it a day at 2: 11am, the guardian reports. He told reporters that republican leaders had agreed to vote on measures to expand background checks and ban gun sales to suspected terrorists, which will be introduced as amendments to a spending bill, reports the washington post. Murphy noted that while he had secured a vote, there's no guarantee that any republicans will actually vote in favor of the measures. During the talkathon, murphy said the orlando mass shooting was a \" devastating \" event, and that the senate \" has done absolutely nothing \" after other mass shootings. Sources from both parties tell politico that during a difficult day of negotiations on capitol hill, very little progress was made in bringing the sides together, even on such a seemingly simple measure as denying guns to suspected terrorists.

Delays weren't, however, due to political concerns, the report finds. Kane had previously suggested that now-governor tom corbett's gubernatorial campaign might have slowed the process; concerns about the case were at the center of her own campaign, the philadelphia inquirer reports. Corbett was a trustee of penn state, where sandusky was a former coach. Had the new report seen politics at play, it could have posed a threat to his re-election campaign, the inquirer notes. Still, \" the report documents that more investigative work took place in just one month in 2011 than in all of either 2009 or 2010, \" kane notes, per the ap. In 2010, the lead prosecutor drafted a grand jury report, but she struggled to get it approved. That report was based on a single victim's claims — likely not enough to get sandusky convicted, says former federal prosecutor geoff moulton, who wrote the new report on the investigation. Police delayed searching sandusky's home because they thought \" they were unlikely to be productive and would have risked publicly revealing the existence of the investigation, \" the report says. Had the initial team of investigators been larger, however, they might have noticed a 1998 complaint about sandusky showering with a child, moulton said.",

The outfits start out red and gold, then transform to a flesh tone below the waist — making it appear to some as if they're not wearing anything down there, the guardian reports. Photos showing the odd attire have recently gone viral, rankling fashionistas and cycling officials, including union cycliste internationale president brian cookson, who tweeted that the uniform is \" unacceptable by any standard of decency \" and that his governing organization is \" on the case. \" the uci says it's contacting the colombian bicycling federation to remind it to keep tabs on uniforms, and former road-race champion nicole cooke tweeted, \" this has turned the sport into a joke. Girls stand up for yourselves — say no. \" but reports indicate one of the team members designed the uniform, got the thumbs-up from her teammates, and wasn't trying to go for the nude look, a cycling journalist tells the bbc. Via npr, the chasing wheels biking blog adds that the questionable band of fabric is actually gold — not flesh-colored — and says, \" lycra done as gold effect never photographs well. \" the designer, identified by the sydney morning herald as cyclist angie ariza, says, \" it is based on sponsors ' colors.

        "summary": "Scientists have a new theory about how the brain processes memories, one that holds the promise — someday — of helping those with depression and other mental illnesses. The study out of the university of wisconsin focused on working memory, which covers immediate stuff like new phone numbers or where we left our car keys. The prevailing theory on this type of memory has long been that the information disappears if a person tucks it away and doesn't think about it for a while. But the researchers found that the memory does, in fact, remain stored in the brain and can be essentially zapped back into play through magnetic stimulation to specific cells, they report in science. No, this doesn't mean that a brain zapper is in the offing to help you remember stuff, but researchers say the implications are still potentially large. \" this changes how we think about the structure of working memory and the processes that support it, \" says co-author nathan rose, per npr. Another researcher, brad postle, explains why this could be a big deal down the road for those suffering from illnesses such as schizophrenia. \" a lot of mental illness is associated with the inability to choose what to think about, \" he says. \" what we're taking are first steps toward looking at the mechanisms that give us control over what we think about. \" it's still a long way off, but the general idea would be to help people redirect their focus; in the case of schizophrenics, that would involve shifting from hallucinations to reality.

The \" heartbeat bill, \" which bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is found ( sometimes as early as six weeks ), doesn't allow for rape or incest exceptions, though abortions to save the mother's life are ok. Per cleveland.com, the bill was unexpectedly shoehorned tuesday into child abuse and child neglect legislation, with kasich able to veto just that item or refuse the entire deal. Ohio republicans, including kasich, had previously balked at such a bill, feeling it wouldn't stand up to constitutional challenges — roe v. Wade makes it illegal for states to ban abortions before a fetus is viable — but some feel empowered by the coming trump presidency and a future trump supreme court pick. \" [ trump has ] changed the dynamic, \" gop state senate president keith faber told reporters, per cleveland.com.

Day, they decided to leave it up in plain view. The interracial couple says their home in stamford, conn., has been vandalized several times and at least three neighbors have shouted the n-word at charles, but lindsay tells the stamford advocate that police have been unresponsive. This time, the couple chose to leave the graffiti for the whole neighborhood to see — and they now face a hefty fine and possibily jail as a result. Stamford's police chief says the couple faces arrest and a fine of $ 100 per day if they don't respond to the city's blight citation, reports nbc new york. The city's director of public safety calls the graffiti \" disgusting \" but says that no witnesses have been found and that neighbors are complaining. \" there are kids in this neighborhood, \" says one. \" why do we have to subject them to that? \" but lindsay, 59, says the graffiti won't be removed until police \" do their job \" and \" not just cover it up … as they have done in the past. \" it \" has to stop, \" charles, 56, tells abc 7. The couple, who plan to fight any fines in court, are now asking police to investigate certain neighbors. \" act like you give a damn and make sure these people are protected, \" says a naacp rep.

        "summary": "The attempted murder of a pastor in idaho after his sunday sermon is drawing extra attention because the pastor had publicly prayed with ted cruz only the day before. But whether there's any connection remains iffy, reports the spokesman review. The pastor, tim remington of coeur d ' alene, works with addicts and had been threatened previously by some of those same addicts, notes the newspaper. Police on monday identified a 30-year-old former marine, kyle odom, as the suspect, and he remains at large. The 55-year-old remington was ambushed sunday in the parking lot of his church. The gunman shot him as many as six times at close range, including in the head, but, incredibly, remington is expected to make a full recovery. The gunman \" stood pretty professional as he was shooting, \" says another pastor at altar church. On saturday, remington had prayed with cruz at a campaign rally and gave the invocation at the event. \" our prayers are with pastor tim, \" a campaign spokeswoman tells nbc news. Meanwhile, a facebook post by a church member is getting wide circulation: \" one of the bullets tried to enter the brain but stopped at the skull, one of the bullets busted his hip, one fractured his shoulder pretty bad, but he is and will continue to be alive and serving god! just like we all knew he would! \" remington and his wife moved to coeur d ' alene after working in street ministry in california and running a coffeehouse there, according to the church website. Security footage shows that odom attended the sunday sermon. Police say he fled the scene in a silver honda accord and should be considered \" armed and dangerous. \"",

The new jersey real housewife says james kridel, who handled the family's original 2010 bankruptcy filing, botched that filing and then \" prepared faulty amendments \" to it, the new york daily news reports. She also says kridel didn't adequately prepare her for her hearing before a bankruptcy court trustee and creditors to whom the family owed money; the trustee objected to the giudices ' bankruptcy filing, which led to them being hit with fraud charges and ultimately convictions. Specifically, giudice claims kridel did not meet with her prior to filing the documents, and did not list assets including her cars, rental property income, and even some bank accounts, tmz reports. In october, kridel told people he \" did not believe that teresa was all that knowledgeable about any of the finances of her family until ultimately she became the breadwinner. Everyone seems to blame her that she knew or should have known, \" he said. \" i don't find that to be true in real life, though.

Ferguson says motel 6 flouted the state's consumer protection act more than 9,000 times at at least six hotels over more than two years, and ice agents would scour the lists for \" latino-sounding names, \" among others, per a release. Ferguson notes motel 6, which says at least six people were detained, even trained new hires on giving data to ice. The complaint, which seeks $ 2,000 per violation, is just one step the state has taken against president trump's immigration crackdown, with other suits already filed on daca and deportations. A spokeswoman from ice, which wasn't listed as a defendant in the suit, noted to the journal that \" viable enforcement tips \" were received \" from a host of sources \" on \" highly dangerous illegal enterprises \" she says take place at hotels and motels; she didn't name motel 6 itself. The company, however, has conceded it gave away guest information, issuing a statement last year saying it happened \" at the local level without the knowledge of senior management. \" ferguson rebuts that, noting the chain has done the same in arizona. The company says it's now revamping its guidelines and will instruct all of its 1,400-plus locations not to hand over guest info without legal papers. \" a guest's activities in their property, particularly their hotel room, is expected to be kept private, \" a hospitality law attorney tells the journal. \" that's one of the basic understandings. \"",

Now the city budgeted for 235 officers has fewer than 200, the chicago tribune reports. Seems it's about money: in the city of about 80,000 just 30 miles southeast of chicago along lake michigan, first-class patrolmen earn just $ 39,304, making it lake county's busiest but lowest-paid department. In nearby merrillville, indiana, entry-level officers are pulling in $ 48,000. Financial problems have left gary unable to compete with raises offered to other public safety workers in recent years. \" anytime you're $ 10,000 less than a neighboring department and have arguably the greatest risk, you don't have to do the math, \" says mayor karen freeman-wilson. \" we get that, \" she adds. \" they need a sense that they're valued. \" meanwhile, gary police are investigating the death of a 17-year-old chicago girl whose body turned up at her old high school in gary, the tribune reports.

Charlie baker signed a new law monday ensuring employees can speak openly about their wages, helping to uncover pay gaps, and requiring equal pay for workers of \" comparable character \" or in \" comparable operations, \" reports the new york times. But the law, taking effect in july 2018, is also the first to bar employers from asking for an applicant's pay history before offering them a job, though applicants can still disclose that information if they choose. Employers will instead be required to present a pay figure upfront. Supporters say the move will benefit women, who are paid 82 cents for every dollar men earn for comparable work in the state, reports boston.com. As companies often set salaries based on an employee's previous wage, \" these are things that don't just affect one job; it keeps women's wages down over their entire lifetime, \" says state sen. Pat jehlen, a democrat who sponsored the bipartisan bill. But the law \" will help every single individual who applies for a job, not just women, \" says the chairwoman of the massachusetts commission on the status of women. \" this is a sea change, and we hope it will be used as a model in other states. \" in case of breaches, workers will be able to file a claim within three years. However, companies who work to fix pay gaps will benefit from \" a three-year defense from liability, \" reports the national law review. Differences in pay will still be allowed based on seniority, geographic location, experience, education, training, or a commission-based system.",

A rundown of some of the debate's inaccuracies: obama wasn't apologizing on his foreign tour early in his presidency. Instead, he acknowledged us foreign policy missteps — but also saluted american ideals. Romney's claim that syria is iran's \" route to the sea \" is just geographically wrong: iran is on the persian gulf and doesn't border syria on land. Obama's implication that ending wars will free up money at home is largely incorrect, since the wars were run on borrowed cash. Contrary to obama's argument, a tuition payment program for top students at massachusetts public institutions did occur under romney. Romney said the idea that he'd liquidate the auto industry was \" silliness \" — but had his bankruptcy plan been put into action, the struggling companies would likely have faced liquidation. The us isn't playing a \" leadership role \" in syria, according to romney. In fact, the obama administration has been active in helping shape the opposition and bringing hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the country. Romney said he'd indict mahmoud ahmadinejad, apparently for threats against israel. But threats don't appear to be grounds for such an indictment under the genocide convention, notes the washington post. Obama overstated romney's comment that we shouldn't move \" heaven and earth \" to get osama bin laden. Days later, romney said that \" we ' ll move everything to get him, \" but it's not just about bin laden — it's about fighting the \" islamic jihad movement \" as a whole. Romney did call russia \" our no. 1 geopolitical foe, \" but in the same interview, he said iran was the world's \" greatest threat, \" politico points out. And while obama was technically correct that the us military might \" have fewer bayonets, \" it does still use them, notes abc news.",

An instagram post by rihanna caused the hashtag freecyntoiabrown to go viral tuesday, reports the tennessean. The 29-year-old brown is serving a life sentence in tennessee for a murder she committed at age 16. She's not eligible for parole until age 69, which advocates call an outrage because they say brown had been a victim of child sex trafficking when the killing took place. In 2004, a 43-year-old realtor named johnny mitchell allen picked up brown in his truck and brought her back to his home for paid sex. While there, she fatally shot him in bed, though brown says she thought allen had been reaching for a gun. \" did we somehow change the definition of #justice, \" wrote rihanna. \" something is horribly wrong when the system enables these rapists and the victim is thrown away for life! to each of you responsible for this child's sentence i hope to god you don't have children, because this could be your daughter being punished for punishing already! \" fellow celebs including kim kardashian west have echoed the message. Brown, who has gotten her associate's degree in prison and is considered a model prisoner, was the subject of a documentary that changed the state's laws on prostitution and sex trafficking, though the changes came too late for her benefit, per newsweek. Now, a 16-year-old would be considered a victim of sex trafficking, not a prostitute. The film also documented the years of physical and sexual abuse brown suffered, as a child and teen.",

Authorities say that after rodgers somehow became lost while driving from tucson to phoenix to visit her grandchildren, her hybrid vehicle ran out of both gas and electric power and she was stranded in the remote white mountains for nine days, cbs news reports. Rodgers and her dog survived by drinking creek water and eating berries and desert plants, authorities say. She was rescued, in fair condition despite suffering from exposure, after an air crew spotted a \" help \" sign she had made from sticks and stones. After the sign was spotted, rescuers found a note from rodgers indicating she had moved down the canyon, and she was found next to a signal fire she had lit. She tells tucson news now that she spent the first night in her car, but after she ran low on water, she decided to move on in hopes of finding people or at least a cell phone signal. Survival instructor cody lundin tells the arizona republic that it is \" very rare, statistically abnormal, and freakish \" for rodgers to have survived so long, and she would have had little hope in a colder season. The ap notes that tucson to phoenix is a straight shot on interstate 10, so it's not clear how rodgers became so lost. ( a \" help \" sign also saved these castaways in the pacific. )",

The report also declared that red meat itself is \" probably \" carcinogenic, not going quite as far as its warning over processed meats.

Expect a furious pushback from the global meat industry, reports the financial times. Already, the north american meat institute has accused the who of \" dramatic and alarmist over-reach. \" most coverage cites coverage from medical experts on both sides of the debate, and the guardian quotes a general practitioner who strikes a middle ground. \" i think we have to take it within reason in that if you are stuffing in burgers and sausages and bacon every day, yes, you are at risk, \" she says. \"if you have some healthy, locally made high-protein sausage once a fortnight, well, i personally don't consider that a risk. \" ( you could also eat this instead of bacon. )",

Gen mladic's lawyer posted the appeal on monday, saying the former bosnian serb commander needed medical attention and was too ill to face trial. Doctors who examined him on friday said he was fit enough to be extradited. The 69-year-old was seized last thursday in lazarevo village, north of belgrade, having been on the run for 16 years. Gen mladic is accused of crimes against humanity committed during the bosnian war, including the 1995 srebrenica massacre of 7,500 muslim men and boys.

The decision revolves around an obscure law on the books in six states called \" alienation of affection, \" reports wsoc. In this case, the 48-year-old king claims he was in a happy marriage with 33-year-old danielle, whom he wed in 2010, until she began an affair with a man she met on a business trip, reports wral and inside edition. \" i've compared it to like a nuclear bomb going on around my surroundings, \" says king, who first got wind of the affair thanks to phone records. That led to a confrontation between king and francisco huizar that was recorded, followed by king learning that he could actually sue his romantic rival over all this. \" my marriage was murdered, \" says king. Last week, a durham county judge agreed, ordering huizar to pay $ 2.2 million in compensatory damages and $ 6.6 million in punitive damages. The result is unusual, with most of the 200 alienation of affection claims filed in north carolina each year settled out of court. But this was \" a very classic case that just happened to have all of the factors, \" king's attorney tells wral. Still, some argue there should be no alienation of affection law at all as it's based on the outdated view that a married woman is her husband's property. It's \" archaic … and should be stricken, \" says huizar's lawyer, who claims king was controlling of his unhappy wife. \" verdicts like these … remove personal responsibility for a person's own marriage. \" huizar plans to appeal.

Mashable reports on a photo tweeted out thursday by the washington free beacon that showed a somewhat disheveled-looking schumer chatting with nebraska sen. Ben sasse ( who looked like he just came from the gym ) outside the us capitol. The paper asked viewers to come up with their own caption, and sasse was one of the first to acknowledge the odd candid, noting the pic looks like he and schumer were \" smoking reefer outside a wedding. \" schumer replied with a \" well that escalated quickly \" ( a line from anchorman, business insider helpfully notes ), right before the memes started proliferating. That's when cruz must have started feeling left out of the senatorial snarkfest. \" so anyway, it's a romper for guys and it's called the romphim and i just ordered two, \" cruz ( or whoever runs his twitter account ) tweeted, referencing the \" fashion revolution \" that's been circulating online this week. Mashable concedes the joke was \" really great, \" while one commenter pointed out a peripheral subject in the photo: a \" creepy \" face-like object in one of the building's windows. \" spicy in a michael myers mask, \" riffed another.

It turns out gildersleeve was only brandishing a fake gun at the time, but police say the investigation is almost finished and charges against the man who shot him are not likely, the chicago tribune reports. Gildersleeve's gun has been variously reported to have been a paint gun, a toy gun, and a paintball gun. Gildersleeve's stepson isn't happy, noting that his stepdad \" doesn't even own a gun. He couldn't own a gun if he wanted to \" and questioning the actions of the man who shot him. \" some people don't actually know how to use guns.

            "A masked man walked into the store and currency exchange about 7 p.m. Saturday on the city's southwest side, displayed a handgun and announced a robbery to an employee, police spokesman anthony guglielmi said. The gunman then pointed his weapon at another employee and forced her to the back of the store. The armed customer then fatally shot the man, identified sunday by the cook county medical examiner's office as 55-year-old reginald gildersleeve. Other details about gildersleeve weren't released. No one else was hurt during the incident. It wasn't immediately clear whether the customer, who has not been identified, will face charges. Guglielmi said preliminary details suggest the customer was not at fault, but that the case was under review by local prosecutors. \" we're looking at it as a self-defense issue at this point, \" he said.

Francis made significant headway in his quest for a more inclusive, forgiving church, reports the new york times, with the synod opening \" church doors... Just a crack \" by way of clearing the way to offer communion to those who have divorced or are unmarried but living together. But the synod, though the times notes it emphasized that gays should be respected, swung those church doors soundly shut on gay marriage, reports the los angeles times, declaring it to have \" no foundation whatsoever. \" consensus seems to be that while the church tacked to the left, it did so tacitly in deference to conservatives. But the pope is where the rubber meets the road, notes the new york times: the synod asked him to release his own paper on the family, which he's expected to do and which could even be presented as an encyclical.

Seth collins is travelling around the country giving $ 500 to restaurant servers in every state - and he's carrying out these seemingly random acts of generosity as a tribute to his brother who died a year ago today. Seth collins joins us from his home in kentucky. Seth, thanks for being here. Seth collins: thank you for having me. Martin: so"

On sunday morning, one of the men posted the video to facebook; it showed an unresponsive kyle kearby, 21, slumped forward as the second man tied cord to kearby's wrists to make him look like a puppet and then moved him around, including opening and closing his mouth, as both men sang \" you've got a friend in me. \" the man is also shown slapping kearby, shaking his head, and pumping his chest.

Kearby's father says his son walked into their residence around 5: 30am sunday, some length of time after the video was filmed, but about seven hours later he was found covered in vomit and unresponsive in bed. He could not be revived and was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Meanwhile, around 7am, the facebook friend had asked the man who posted the video whether kearby was really dead and the man said he was alive and home and that the video had been posted as a wake-up call for him. Authorities say that even if kearby's friends knew he was in danger of dying, there is no law requiring them to report his condition to authorities. The men told authorities they were \" horseplaying \" with kearby as they have done before, and had dropped him off at home after the video was filmed. \" there was no foul play whatsoever, \" the county sheriff says. An autopsy will be done to determine what substances kearby may have taken and what caused his death.",

The defense had claimed its clients were acting in self-defense after insurgents and iraqi cops shot at them, while prosecutors painted a picture of the guards having a \" low regard and deep hostility toward iraqi civilians, \" as the ap describes it. The defendants were ordered to jail immediately. Slatten faces life in prison and the others long stretches, but all are expected to appeal. On the day of the sept. 16, 2007, shootings in nisur square, blackwater guards were trying to clear the way for a state department convoy before shots rang out, reuters reports. There was \" gunfire coming from the left, gunfire coming from the right, \" as hundreds of iraqi people in the square fled, a prosecutor said in closing arguments. The case incited iraqi outrage and anti-american feelings around the world and made some question what rules government-employed security contractors had to follow overseas, reuters notes.

According to abc7, the bus was finally stopped by some scaffolding, which fell into the street. A witness says they saw people falling from the scaffolding. Ktvu reports at least three people were trapped under the bus after it crashed, and at least five cars were totaled as it careened down the street. Victims had to be extricated from four damaged cars, according to abc7. Nbc bay area reports there were approximately 30 people on the tour bus when it crashed.

            "Americans work more than anyone in the industrialized world. More than the english, more than the french, way more than the germans or norwegians. Even, recently, more than the japanese. And americans take less vacation, work longer days, and retire later, too. That much most people agree on. What's harder to pin down is exactly how much americans are working. It may be more than our industrialized competitors, but is it more than we have ever worked before? the short answer, according to the government, is that it is only slightly more and not so much that most people should really notice. Numbers from the bureau of labor statistics show a very gradually rising trend through the 1990s that has only just recently tapered off, hovering somewhere just north of 40 hours weekly. A month more a year? the long answer is, of course, more complicated. It depends who you ask, and about whom you're asking. Author juliet schor, who wrote the best-selling book the overworked american in 1992, concluded that in 1990 americans worked an average of nearly one month more per year than in 1970. There are also volumes of surveys that ask people if they're working more than they used to. Generally, people say yes, of course they are.",

Now oregon state archaeologist dennis griffin says it is indeed a shipwreck, and that two wood samples taken from the boat's 21-foot keel are currently being tested, with results expected later this month, reports the ap. The tests should help pinpoint what type of lumber was used in construction, which in turn could point to the boat's origins. And while the tests won't determine age, a volunteer at the columbia river maritime museum who's visited the site says it's probably a 20th-century vessel, reports the daily astorian. To griffin, it's an exciting find because of what it might tell us about the past. \" it's about historical value, \" he says. \" we don't place monetary value on these sites. \" he says that more than 3,000 wrecks are known to be off oregon's rugged coastline, but the state database has the locations of barely more than 300. Whether this particular ship is from the logging, fishing, or commercial industries, learning more about it helps \" tie us more into the land that we now live in. \" but the remains won't be moved; out of the water, sand is the best medium for preserving the wood, which would otherwise cost a lot of money to preserve in a plastic solution in a large tank, griffin adds.

But government documents and interviews unearthed by the washington post are now not only identifying a white house advance-team member who also allegedly took part in \" after-hours \" activities — they also appear to back up claims that senior white house aides were told about this team member, a volunteer at the time, and didn't do a heck of a lot about it. The volunteer, since identified as jonathan dach, has categorically denied engaging with a prostitute or bringing someone back to the cartagena hilton and is now working full-time for the administration as a women's issues adviser. The secret service — which saw about two dozen agents fired or punished because of the scandal — reportedly showed white house officials ( including kathryn ruemmler, the government's counsel at the time ) evidence that dach had brought someone up to his room, but those findings were said to be dismissed. White house officials say they conducted interviews with dach and \" concluded that he had done nothing wrong \"; they also told the post earlier this year that a ) dach was just a volunteer at the time, not an employee, and b ) prostitution is legal in cartagena.

In tangent after tangent, she complained about how horrible her pregnancy was, barked out orders to the camera crew, made up new words — basically, anything but try to sell her designs. Because nobody should be deprived of a chance to experience it, i've edited carey's entire appearance down to the most memorable four minutes, video of which appears above. And when you're done, be sure to check out this epic supercut video from rich juzwiak that features carey saying the word \" love \" on air no less than 71 times."

While those who passed the law late last month say breastfeeding is \" the right of every child for two years \" and \" a duty and not an option, \" a support group for mothers with postnatal illness is disturbed. \" the danger is that with the threat of punishment, these women could face additional stress at an already challenging time, risking serious repercussions and potentially contributing to postnatal depression, \" the group says. The country's social affairs minister is concerned, too, but for a very different reason. \" this part of the law can be a burden, \" she says, noting husbands may be able to sue their wives if they don't breastfeed. How the law will be enforced, though, isn't clear. \" some families leave their children to maids and don't breastfeed. This is part of raising a child, though, this is mandatory, \" a member of the council that passed the law tells the national. \" if they do not have a mother or have been neglected, then they should get this right from someone else \" — perhaps a wet nurse.",

Roger ailes released a statement today, and he does not sound pleased. An excerpt, per usa today: \" donald trump's surprise and unprovoked attack on megyn kelly during her show last night is as unacceptable as it is disturbing. Megyn kelly represents the very best of american journalism and all of us at fox news channel reject the crude and irresponsible attempts to suggest otherwise.... Donald trump rarely apologizes, although in this case, he should. \" and trump's quick response, per the daily beast: \" i totally disagree with the fox statement. I do not think megyn kelly is a quality journalist. I think her questioning of me, despite all of the polls saying i won the debate, was very unfair. Hopefully in the future i will be proven wrong and she will be able to elevate her standards to a level of professionalism that a network such as fox deserves. \" for more trump, see what \" secret weapon \" he has in common with bill clinton.",

Because he shamelessly caters to paranoid conservatives. Because he's famous. He's not politically correct. He never says sorry. He's unfailingly entertaining. And the press can't resist him. But there's another reason that no one has considered yet, a secret weapon that has propelled past charismatic politicians like bill clinton and theodore roosevelt to the white house: hypomanic temperament. To be clear, i ' m not using my authority as a professor of psychiatry to call trump mentally ill. Hypomanic temperament is not an illness.
